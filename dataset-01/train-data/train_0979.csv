5,The Natural (DVD),"When I ordered the DVD, The Natural, I did not expect it to arrive earlier than originally thought. I was extremely pleased with the speed of shipment as well as the quality of the DVD when it arrived."
5,The Only Baseball Movie You Need,"If you were to purchase only one baseball movie, this is the one. Great cast and cinematography."
4,O.K.,"L like Robert Redford and ""The Natural"" but I could have done without the Director.and all his talking. But the movie is great."
4,Great Movie...but the Blu-ray isn't the Director's Cut,"I love this movie, and was eager to get it on Blu-Ray. It looks fantastic, but I believe the title on Amazon to be incorrect. I had the Director's Cut of the DVD, which is an extended version of the movie with added scenes. The Blu-Ray is the theatrical version. I looked in the menu and didn't find anything that gives the impression that the extended version (Director's Cut) is on the disk. I wish it were as there are some good extra scenes. If someone knows something I don't, I'm all ears."
5,The Natural,"I cannot review this product because I purchased it as a gift for friends. However, I am giving it 5 stars because my friends love watching ""Field of Dreams."" They have watched it too many times to count. The family recently got a DVD Player and ""Field of Dreams"" was the first DVD they purchased to watch. ""The Natural"" being in a similar vein will most assuredly be as watched since they love anything baseball related. Personally, I would give it a ""5"" just for the main character, Robert Redford."
3,A great film with missed opportunities,"This is a wonderful period film which suffers from ""star mentality."" The whole show is built around Robert Redford and everyone else is a throw-away character. You have outstanding players like Wilford Brimley and Richard Farnsworth who's appearance add great strength to the story, but are never really allowed to ""shine"" in their roles. You wonder how much of their performances wound up on the cutting room floor. What could have been a story about a ""team"" finding their soul(with help from Roy Hobbs) turns into a self-serving story about a baseball ""one man"" show."
2,The Natural is supernatural fantasy.,"The Natural is one of the best examples of missed opportunities you are ever likely to see. It pits a baseball hero against all odds and nearly keeps you in suspense up until the ridiculous final third of the film. The whole plot falls apart when Hobbs becomes Superman, and begins skinning baseballs with his fantasyland bat. The climax, which involves a Grand Slam into the floodlights, is really silly, and would be better served in a Three Stooges comedy. A terrific buildup to a goofy climax. A real disappointment."
1,Completely Dissatisfied!,"I couldn't even play my new DVD, The Natural, in my my DVD player or my 2 computers. It came scratched in the wrapping. I have never before received a inoperable product until now. Buyer beware!!"
1,Huge disappointment,"I saw previews of this movie and thought it would be great. I love baseball and almost everything Robert Redford has ever done. After a very promising start, the movie just went way over the top and became almost a cartoon. Every time the guy hits a homerun the cover actually flies off the ball or he hits the lights, setting off fireworks or something else larger than life happens. I went into this movie with great expectations and left feeling like they blew it. If they hadn't tried to make everything so much bigger than life the movie could have been a believable story."
3,Great Movie!,"This is definitely a movie you can enjoy as a couple, great story not only for baseball fans but also for the love story fans. I love this movie!"
2,There is no Korean subtitle,There is no Korean subtitle but the specification show Korean subtitle.I want to return this blu ray but it's too late. I found it few days ago.
2,Lame love story with effeminate baseball action,"Anyone who actually thinks this is a good baseball movie must not be much of a baseball fan. This is a love story disguised as a baseball movie and its a real stretch to imagine Redford as any type of athlete, let alone a major league home run hitter - all 5'8"", 150# of him as he trots around like a little girl. Tired, weak baseball stereotypes abound throughout the movie. Pretty good love story for chicks; definitely not a real baseball movie."
2,"If it ain't broke, don't fix it!","You know how it is with ""new and improved"" - I've rarely found that to be the case, and certainly not here. I loved the original theatrical version of The Natural, but this isn't it. It is a much darker, and less cohesive story, that suffers in the translation."
5,Love This Movie,This is one of the best sports movies ever made. Anything Redford does is top notch regardless of the subject matter. To be able to have this in Blu-Ray is exciting.
4,A Feel Good Classic!,This is the kind of movie to watch whenever you're feeling a little depressed. It has the ability to lift anyone emotionally throughout. The soundtrack was especially uplifting at the final ballpark scene. Robert Redford was exceptional in his role. A keeper for any collection.
4,ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES ABOUT BASEBALL.,"""The Natural"" is the biggest influence of all the baseball movies that appeared after 1984, and that's because this is a very good film. ""The Natural"" is one of the best movies of the director Barry Levinson, and also features an all-star cast: Robert Redford, Robert Duvall, Glenn Close & Kim Basinger.""The Natural"" has a good message: it's better trying late than never trying at all. Despite the fact that the main character Roy Hobbs (Robert Redford) is a 35 year old rookie, he never quits to his dream of becoming the best baseball player.This movie is recommendable for all baseball fans."
5,Among My Top Ten of All Time,"I believe the comments of others do a fine job describing this film. I would only add the following:There is every chance that other than a mature individual will not enjoy this movie so greatly as others obviously have.There are moments in the actors' dialogue, comments on life and its lessons, that the casual viewer will probably miss.Robert Redford attended the University of Colorado on a baseball scholarship.Redford and Hall of Fame member Don Drysdale were starters on the same high school baseball team.Don Drysdale is among the best hitting pitchers, ever. He was elected to the Hall of Fame the same year ""The Natural"" was released at theatres."
5,The Director's Cut is the only version to see!,The Natural (Director's Cut)This version of The Natural was so much better than the original theatrical release. I love the director's vision. It elevated the movie from good to outstanding. It's the only version I'll watch.
5,A brilliant slice of Americana,"What a film. Stunning cinematography, excellent acting, and well-thought-out direction by the great Barry Levinson (of Rainman fame) add-up to create this film student's all-time favorite work. You can smell the infield dirt, and hear the sharp crack of horsehide on Ash while watching this film. To me, it's about as close to a ""full"" sensory experience as a film can come. Lest we forget, Randy Newman's soundtrack surely ranks as one of the top two or three of all time (With deference to the great John Williams). The music itself is what first drove me to collect soundtracks, and indeed, provided me with much of my love of film, and of the national pastime."
5,I want my DVD,My favorite movie of all time period! I am looking to get this in DVD format... any info?
5,"If you enjoy sports, you can't help but love this movie!!!","I saw this movie when I was 8 and have loved watching it ever since. If you enjoy sports at all you will love this movie. I give the acting a 3, but the plot and the drama deserve 6 stars. This movie will grab your heart and make you wish you could play baseball again. Its my favorite movie of all time. If you liked Hoosiers or Rudy, you will enjoy this."
5,My father's America,"Remember James Earl Jones' soliloqy in ""Field of Dreams""? ""The Natural"" is what he was talking about. Every March since this flick came out, my son and I watch this movie. All-Star cast- Redford, Close, Duvall, and especially Wilford Brimley. Go to a ballpark and holler ""I should'a been a farmer!"", and watch the heads nod. Don't miss this. NEED THIS ON DVD!!!!!! NOW!!!!!!"
2,Love Redford but...,"People tell me I am the spitting image of a young Robert Redford so I usually go out of my way for his movies. This one didn't have much substance, though. It's about a baseball player in the 1800's that is shot in the chest by a stray bullet and continues to play in a baseball game. Due to an electrical failure and a defective baseball, the game is halted and his team is granted the win to much fanfare. There is also a subplot with some woman... possibly a lukewarm love affair. I did not pay much mind to those parts so I can't recall every detail of it."
1,One of the WORST movies I've seen,"A coworker forwarded me a list of '20 movies that make men cry' and the Natural was one I hadn't gotten arount to seeing. (BTW 'Old Yeller' is the ONLY legitimate movie on the list.)The only reason to cry when seeing this movie is from the pain caused by stabbing youe eyes out with an ice pick to avoid seeing any more. My very first impression was that Redford, besides being a terrible actor, looks about 30 years too old to play the ADULT character. Never mind the complete joke of him as a 19 year old. The plot is about as lame as they come and the ending is just stupid. Really NONE of the characters are believable except possibly Glenn Close but her brief screen time is not sufficient to rescue this abomination.I realize a lot of guys will want to see this for themselves and there is that masochistic fringe that will enjoy this movie simply because it is so bad.If you just have to subject yourself to this -- rent Don't buy!"
2,Overrated tripe,"The Bottom Line:A baseball movie that knows nothing about the sport (Roy Hobbs is a pitcher the first time we see him and, inexplicably, a slugging right fielder the next time he's on screen) and attempts to impose a larger-than-life mythological feel on a simple story that manifestly cannot support it, The Natural is an overlong, overrated, and unenjoyable film that didn't even have the guts to follow its source novel to the dark conclusion the plot warrants.2/4"
3,Where is the Director's Cut on Blu-ray?,"I always loved this movie; and was extremely impressed when they came out with the Director's Cut with the extra footage which really solved the continuity problem in my opinion. The Director's Cut was also released in High Definition, so it looked good on my Blu-ray player. What I can't believe, and am thoroughly disappointed with, is that the Blu-ray doesn't contain the Director's Cut. At the very least, they should have offered both versions on the Blue-ray (it's not like they don't have the room to do it). I had a hunch that this was the original, so I checked the running time against my Director's Cut, and sure enough, this is the shorter version. This will be the first time I've taken a Blu-ray back (unopened of course)--I'd rather just keep the non-Blue-ray version. This is totally inexcusable for this classic movie to be released this way. Shame on you film studio."
4,A surprise read,"While I was looking for somemore of Coulter's books to buy on Amazon.com, I was surprised that this book was rated so low! I just finished reading it yesterday and was pleasantly entertained. It's a romantic contemporary suspense with a hunk for a hero and a beautiful heroine that needs protecting. I thought how Coulter wove the plot with scenes from the 'soap' she starred in was well done and flowed nicely. I also enjoyed reading the little trivia about the history of soaps at the beginning of each chapter. I would recommend this book and not let the poor rating detour you."
2,A very light read.,"Born to be Wild by Catherine Coulter is a fun story about a queen of mean soap opera star who offstage is more like the girl next door. She goes home for a visit; she's hoping the cops will find the stalker whose trying to kill her while she's gone. She loves seeing her father and realizes the police chief isn't so bad, even if he did throw her in jail once, but her cold, spiteful mother her two manipulative sisters are just as nasty as ever. She returns to L.A and after he wraps up a murder in the little town, the police chief in hops down to L.A. to help find her stalker. Unfortunately there are no real surprises and the characters are a little too stereotyped to be interesting."
1,What a waste,"The plot wandered, and I didn't care at all about the characters. The police chief of a town in Oregon goes to babysit a soap star in California because her daddy asked him to? While he has a murder investigation of his own going on? Double murders and suicides in Oregon and he's in the sun at Malibu? Don't waste your money or your time. Too many characters, too many overlaping plots that go no where."
1,Not worth reading,"The story line was ok, but the ending will really disappoit you. You read the whole book to have it end in 2 pages and no imagination at all."
3,A Spoof on Daytime Soaps,"You've won it all, time and time again, but somewhere out there someone is trying a kill you. You are at the top of popularity in daytime TV drama with loads of friends who hang out at your special home, even the photographers who lurk in the bushes are clusty, yet someone special eludes your space.A trip home and you find a mother to forget, two nutty sisters and an okay dad who does rescue you from an unimpressed sheriff who stashed you in jail overnight. All the elements of high drama on the tube, but major points don't meld in a novel. Which is it? A romance or a mystery? Who knows, this reviewer doesn't, but it was a fun romp with great laughs.Nash Black, author of TRAVELERS and SINS OF THE FATHERS."
3,Okay,"This is not one of the best Catherine Coulter books, but it was good enough to finish. I prefer her FBI series.It was difficult to keep track of the characters. I had to keep going back to see who was who. Usually I can't put the FBI stories down....this story line seemed to drag on and it took me awhile to finish because I couldn't stay interested."
3,Too many characters,"I am a big fan of Catherine Coulter's FBI series and was really looking forward to this book but I found I was rather disappointed. I'm hoping this is a first in a series so there is a reason for meeting so many different characters in one book, but it times it can be confusing.For the longest time I wasn't exactly sure which hero our ""damsel in distress"" was going to be paired with. The plot seemed to move along quickly but when I got to the end all I could think of was ""is that it?""Overall it is good for a quick read and it will make much more sense to me if there is some follow up books with a lot of the characters we've already me."
4,Coulter review,"I found this book a little hard to start because of the multiple charcters with both stage names and real names. But after I had read a little further into the book, I went back and reread the beginning and understood what was going on. I thought it was an excellent story. Quite different from the FBI series that she writes. It was exciting also I thought."
3,Wiccan Cards,"These cards are okay. They aren't the best quality, flimsy and kind of soft. They have good color and I like simple but detailed images. There aren't very many, and I felt like there should be more. The deck is really small, about the size of playing cards. I would have liked them bigger, but their size didn't impede on seeming them. They are easy to shuffle, but I felt again how thin they are compared to even regular playing cards. Besides that, some of the images were a little repetitive. I thought, there are so few cards, by not include very different images then these that are pretty close to each other? Other than that, there seemed to be a good spread of images on different Wiccan items or common Wiccan symbols. Overall, they aren't bad, good color, okay size, but poor quality and low in number."
2,Oracle cards,The cards were so small and not what I expected...too expensive for such a small deck...
4,Piano King with his throat-clearing Population,"Richter's mastery of tonal landscaping and musical insights are highly visible in this album. Bach's Preludes and Fugues are the best sounding Bach I've ever heard. Everything is going great until of course the audience began to clear their throats, not just for a second, a minute or two. The disturbing devilish coughing lied in the background for the entire recording as if someone was planted to sabotage the whole recording. This is no fun!"
2,"Richter is great but ""live"" has audience","Too much coughing for me - it is truly annoying to hear so much coughing!!I love Richter - too bad the CD is full of audience noise.Still, BUY IT if you love Richter, but it will not become your favorite CD.Or, listen to it in the winter when you're coughing a lot, too, then it'll seem OK."
3,Appalling!!,"I'd have ranked this cd with 5 stars since Richter has a very good technique in controlling the sound of the keys he's playing but the audience had to ruin everything by coughing and clearing throats. I mean what's up with that? Eventhough i tried my very best to drain those sounds away, i still hear them. Is it my ears or what? If only i could filter those sounds. I wonder if there's another cd that has the same contents but with no sounds from the audience clearing throats.(...)Thanks"
4,pretty good album,"Emotions is a pretty good album. A recommended album if you are willing to dance. Here are how i rate the songs on emotions:Emotions- very good dance song, beautiful vocals, 5And You Don't Remember- this song is a great ballad, 5Can't Let Go- a fimiliar track, very good, 5Make it Happen- good song, 4If it's over- good song, 4You're so cold- very energetic song, 5So Blessed- great song, 5To Be Around You- ok song, 3Till the End of Time- good song, 4The Wind- not a good ending song, sounds very sad, 1"
4,Nice,"Her second album was a good follow up to her debut, with poppy songs such as 'emotions' and 'make it happen', to please the mainstream, but also songs like 'can't let go' and 'and you don't remember', songs which show more artistic talent and not just strong vocals.This album didn't sell aswell as her debut, but is def. worth the money. While some obvious fillers - 'So cold', 'To be around you' aren't as good as her debut ones, other supposed fillers actually make the album - songs such as 'So Blessed' and 'Till the End of Time'.Her last track, 'The Wind' is in her 'breathy' voice for the start, but doesn't sound weak at all like some of her latter hits (EG, 'Boy' ). 'The Wind' is a hidden bonus - unlike other artists that pick a slow, reminiscing and boring song to finish off their album, Mariah manages to capture her audience until her last, breathy note."
3,Sophomore,"EMOTIONS, the 1991 chart-topping release from dance/pop chanteuse Mariah Carey, showed the world that she would have no sophomore slump. With her knack for writing hit material, Carey turned out a few smashes off of this release. The title cut was #1 on the Billboardchart for three weeks. Mariah sings her heart out on the power ballad ""Can't Let Go,"" which went to #2 in early '92. Her distinctive multi-octave range allows her to manipulate casual dance/pop melodies, making them soar. However, EMOTIONS, is perhaps her weakest album yet, but there's some worthwhile material here."
3,I'M SORRY MARIAH,Most people say this is here best album but it is not. The first three songs are great but the rest sound too much alike. Maybe if just a few of the songs had that sort of gospel/R&B sound to it it would be okay but too many of them do. This is a good CD to relax to but not good to really enjoy. Here voice has never been better but the songs are all too slow. I like every other album she has ever made even Glitter which really wasn't bad. She has carried us all into different types of music all of which was great except this one. This isn't here best album Music Box is. Music Box has many down beat songs but it is great even better than Glitter. One good thing I must say about this album is no other songs she has every song has compared to Emotions are Can't Let Go.
2,Same old sound,"Mariah Carey produced wonderful music in her ""Vision of Love"" album, but this is like the same thing all over again. This album is no different than Mariah's previous album."
5,Emotional,"Everything she sings sounds magical. The power of her beautiful voice simply mesmerizes me. How can you not fall in love with heart tuggers like Can't let go, So blessed, stompers like Emotions and Make it happen? My favorites are You're so cold, Can't let go, So blessed, Till the end of time, and If it's over. The arrangements soar and swing. Any good Mariah fan cannot simply miss out on this classic."
5,Another Great Album from Mariah!,"Mariah Carey has once again proven just how talented she is! ""Emotions"" is a wonderful CD! All the songs on this album are great, with the exceptions of ""And You Don't Remember"", and ""Can't Let Go"". Mariah truly is very talented, however her voice can become too high at times. Also, the background voclas/singers drown out her voice sometimes, which can become annoying and frustrating. I think Mariah should cultivate her voice a little more, but over all ""Emotions"" is an excellent album!"
2,dangerous step in her career,"this album was very weak, Emotions was the only good song. If she hadn't released the MTV unplugged CD and worked hard on Music Box to have it become her best selling album ever, she would have become a flash in the pan after her first self titled CD, but it's 15 years after that and mariah is still making good music, keep it up girl!"
2,Skip This One.....,"....and buy ""Mariah Carey"" and ""Butterfly"" instead. The music on this album is very bland, thanks to Clivilles & Cole and Walter Afanasieff. She should have stuck with her original producers on this one. I was very disappointed when I first bought it 10 years ago after loving Mariah's debut! I didnt buy another one of her albums until ""Butterfly""."
3,"It is a nice album, but it is not worth the money","I saved my money to get this album (on vinyl) for a few weeks before I actually bought at a little record store around my house. Anyway, I thought that the album was a huge disappointment. It does not even compare to her first album (which was her best)."
3,Track Listing,1. Emotions (12'' Club Mix) 5:542. Emotions (12'' Instrumental) 5:103. Emotions (LP Version) 4:124. There's Got To Be A Way (12'' Mix) 8:255. There's Got To Be A Way (Vocal Dub Mix) 7:09
2,Buy this used,"If you're a huge Mariah fan, and you must have every one of her albums, take it from me and buy this used. This album was obviously rushed (as she even admitted), and only 3 of the albums tracks do a thing for me. Not the greatest release at all. Too bad ""Can't let go"" hadn't gone #1."
2,Worst Mariah Carey Album,"Mariah Carey started off with a mega sucessful debut in 90'. Her follow up promised to be better but one listen made your toes curl.Sure, no matter what album she records, she displays her beautiful talented voice. She is actually one of my favorite singers right beside Michael Jackson, Whitney Houston, Vanessa Williams and Alicia Keys.Yes the title song Emotions was great but became to repetive and annoying. No other song provided much. Music Box was way overhyped while this one wasn't. Her best album to date is Butterfly and new album Charmbracelet which embraces hip hop, a music I DON'T care for much.check out my site: http://www.mjacksononline.tripod.com"
1,NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO,MARIAH CAREY SOUNDS LIKE AN OWL IN A VERY BIG DEAL OF PAIN. WHY DON'T WE ALL END HER MISERY BY EXPLODING HER EMPTY HEAD. IF YOU HAVE ANY TASTE IN MUSIC DON'T BUY IT. SAVE YOURSELF THE MONEY.
2,Tears In Heaven,"What can we say about Mariah? She proved in her early days in the industry that the music mattered, but when she started to overshadow it with being too sexy on the outside, it just became overdubbed no matter where the music was.Her 1991 album Emotions, was truly the end of Mariah's innocence. Although the album has some strong ballads like Can't Let Go, and The Wind, the other songs just don't seem to fit all around.It is always nice to hear the older side of her music that still has an ear for words."
3,"This is a essential reference, but","I have been a cath labo nurse for 3 months.This is a nice book for cath labo staff like me, but there isn't so many figure enough to understand coronary anatomy in angiography and electorophysic study."
2,bad seal!,"In my last dive trip, 3 eco flares only last 1 or 2 dives, because a bad seal let water get into bat compartment!"
4,Nice safety light.,This is a nice little light. The blinking red bulb burns bright and I use it as a safety light for my bicycle.
2,There is no user's manual...I don't know how to turn it on,"The package is so simple.There is no user's manual or anything to specify how to use this light.I installed the battery then seal the white top, then...nothing happen.The light didn't turn on, and there is no controler or anything on the body...I don't know what happened.I suppose that light will be on after I installed the battery???"
3,"Okay product, but needs improvements. I do not recommend.","Great for a low-light, long lasting beacon. Not very bright, so not for long distances or bright areas. Runs on two regular AAA batts, not your button ones. Easy to pocket or clip on. I do not like that you have to twist it hard to turn off and on. The body has no traction, so easy operation is not an option. Too pricey for a limited product. With a few improvements (push switch, better grip, and clear cone), this light would be awesome. I do not recommend this, other similar items available."
2,You get what you pay for.,"In all honestly, I'm not sure the Freeports deserve the Sennheiser name. Yes, they're much less expensive than the Evolutions, so I might not expect them to be quite as good, but these things are barely adequate. Using them in a church for weddings, my audio operator had to start setting up near the front altar, because the Freeport's range just couldn't reach the back of the church. And even up front, we still get the occasional noise into the signal. This is especially noticeable when switching between the dual-diversity antennaes, something I never saw on the Evolution mics, which switched totally seemlessly.Bottom line, these mics are cheap - in price, and in quality. You get what you pay for."
1,Beethoven under glass,"Surely the critics jest when they hold this set up as a serious and serviceable offering when it contains, by one critics reckoning ""a senselessly rushed 'Pastoral'"" and certainly the most superficial 8th ever recorded. Toss in a lackluster performances of Nos. 1 & 2 and a 7th that is, oh, all right, better than his earlier or later accounts of this most perplexing and difficult symphony to get right. So where does that leave us? - unsatisfied and outwitted by the Karajan PR juggernaut. Those of us who have to work hard in order to pay good $$ for our CDs deserve better. How about: Walter 1 & 2; Szell 3 & 8; C. Kleiber 4(live), 5 & 7; Bohm 6 & 9. At least one will have, in the hands of these masters, readings that remain committed and that may develop in time into deeply satisfying and long remembered experiences with these imperishable masterpieces. And what is more, one will have turned one's hard earned $$ into gold rather than aluminum."
1,Do Not Buy This Edition!,This Edition is messed up I just got it expecting Vol 1 (Becuase thats what the cover says) But the inside pages are Vol 2!! Total waste of money for me becuase I needed Vol I. Buy a diffrent edition. I would have given no stars if I could have.
4,hepa filter,"After looking at many sites to buy this replacement filter, this site offered the lowest price, and it is the Hunter brand not an off brand. We were pleased to find it here."
5,Great Read,"I was so excited to see this book featured in a recent issue of ""Fortune"" magazine, which called it an ""excellent"" read. JetBlue is my favorite airline, and I was happy to see a book had been written about it. This book does a great job of laying out Neeleman's business approach, which he began developing as a young man. I really enjoyed the insider look at how JetBlue was formed. This is truly an inspirational story that even non-JetBlue fans will enjoy."
3,Interesting but.....,"No question is an interesting book however before reading it, I was looking for a deeper balance of such an interesting story. There is a lot to lern from David Neeleman but in my opinion would have been more interesting if the author would have spent (as he did on the success) more time on the drawbacks of Jetblue. Not everything is gravey in business.."
3,This Book is No Longer Operative,"Since ""Flying High"" was published a lot of things at JetBlue have come unstrung, including David Neeleman's hold on the CEO job. The airline's disastrous meltdown at JFK during bad weather in February 2007 demonstrated that its media image wasn't matched by operational prowess -- and proved the validity of a timeless adage in the business world: the qualities needed to conceive and launch a business, which Neeleman has in spades, are not the qualities needed to stabilize and grow a business.Today JetBlue is retrenching, cautious, slow-growth mode, parking airplanes and struggling to recover from the black eyes it endured in 2007... and Neeleman has been revealed as something less than the Superman this book portrays him as."
1,Dull and duller,"It's amazing to me how a book about one of the most interesting airlines could be this lame. Actually, it's about JetBlue's founder, and he's surprisingly dull himself. Don't buy this book if you're a fan of the airline (as I am) because you will be sorely disappointed."
5,Great DVD,Arrived on time for Christmas. Packaged nicely and is a great collection of cartoons for kids and adults. I recommend for all Ghostbuster fans.
5,Who you gonna call?,Oh the Memories! Loved the show as a child and not much has changed! The show has some of the best writers I the Business including pre Babylon 5 creator J. Michael Straczynski! This season includes the return or both the Bogeyman and Samhain! I also love the episode where the Ghostbusters are brought to an alternate reality version of New York called Boo York and have to face off against the People busters (Basically ghost like version of themselves).An excellent set for anyone who loved the show as a child. My only complaint is the fact that the box mentions that the episodes are digitally remastered which in my opinion is clearly false. There is tons of artifacts and color loss within the episodes; however this doesn't change the fact that it's an awesome show and highly recommended!
4,Wonderful sampler,"This sampler of the Complete Beethoven Edition is a steal. Over 70 minutes of music, a wide variety of Beethoven's work (not just highlights of his better known works). It is packaged with a beautifully illustrated booklet containing performance info, information about the more complete sets in this collection, and Beethoven's life (in three languages). The recording quality varies, with session dates on the sampler ranging from 1963 to present, but everything (though not all definitive performances) is done quite well. This would be a great introduction to the world of Beethoven, or super to carry around in the car."
1,you can buy it on tmobile website directly,"No need to buy here, you can buy it on tmobile website directly using credit card, just type in your tmobile phone number, your credit card number, how many minutes card you need, you can get it immediately after 1 click, no tax for it at all. Don't bother to buy here, waisteing shipping time and cost."
4,Cards from Amazon.com take time to become valid,"I like the T-Mobile prepaid plan and this card provides the best value. I have previously purchased this product from Amazon.com and used it immediately. However, my last purchased card took about 10 days to become valid with T-Mobile. Bottom line: Don't buy from Amazon if you need to recharge immediately. You can call T-Mobile and recharge with your credit card. However, if you can wait, Amazon.com provides good value for me in CA - I save the sales tax."
3,You might have to wait for a few days before you can activate!!!,"I ran into problems when trying to call Tmobile to activate. They told me the number on this card don't even exist. I purchased this on Feb 2nd, I called Tmobile and Amazon twice but did not work out. But today Feb 12, after arguing with a guy from Amazon.com, I call to activate again and it work. So I think, you might need to wait a few day. It's just like you buy one from retail store like Walmart, I remember I saw something like you won't be able to activate it after purchase. Maybe info from card need to be transfer to Tmobile, that's why you'll see on the back ""void if not activated 90 days from purchase"" because they know when you purchase it.Phew! I feel relieve now!"
1,This $100 Prepaid Refill Card is valid for only 90 days,"I ordered this card, but the card clearly says ""Unused minutes expires 90 days after activation of this card"". It is not 1 year!"
3,Ever want a time machine? Maybe not!,Well developed characters and doings in this community . Interesting details about structure and workings of an early English town complete with a little side of murder and evil. I liked that not everything was fairytale or perfectly resolved.
5,Medieval,I really enjoyed this book. The research about the Medieval years must have been thorough because it did feel real. If you like history - as I do - you'll like this adventure.
3,Wine,"A little slow going, but muddled through about half of it....in stages! Went a little too long with the last chapter I tried to read and lost the 'line of thinking'! Good for some, not so much for me."
4,Interesting new writer,"This is a book from a new writer who has got closer than most to the true atmosphere of life in a medieval religious community. If you enjoy mysteries set in medieval days, give this one a try. The characters are solid and believable. The settings and dialogue are well-researched and accurate.It's difficult, when you write a book about a time several hundred years ago, to portray accurately the feeling of a very different time while realizing that human nature is basically much the same now as it was then. There were greedy people, lazy people, untrustworthy people. We know the type, we see them and their effects every day. What we don't see is a huge section of the population desperately clinging to religion to save them from the fires of hell. The writer straddles this dichotomy very well.Her characters are so well realized that I'm hoping to meet many of them again in future books"
4,Interesting Midieval Whodunnit,"This is the first book of a proposed series that takes place during the Middle Ages at a monastery and convent. This priory is unusual in that it is run by a nun, almost unheard of in those days. The characters are compelling,the writing is crisp and the dialogue believable. I do hope that more historical content is included in further books in the series. This is a book well worth reading and I think that the author will only get better over time."
3,WIne of Violence doesn't quite make the grade,"I downloaded this to my kindle because of the description on the kindle which starts Roman Britain in 91 AD is a troblesome part of the mighty Empire riles by Domitian Caesar. Imagine my surprise when i find myself in England in 1271 in a dual house abbey.I finally found the book described. The title is Shadows in The Night: An Aurelia Marcella Roman Mystery Strange yes? I have seen some really creative editing or lack of editing in Kindle downloads but this is the first time it has has ever been so far afield.Ah well I did read the story of Eleanor Wynethorpe's arrival at Tyndal Priory the aubsequent murders, the sexual over - undertones and the unsurprising conclusion.I gave it three in hopes the books improve in supense.Margaret Frazer and Sister Frevisse do it better and would be a good tutor for this new authoress"
4,Interesting Medieval Mystery,"When a young nun, Eleanor, is appointed prioress of Tyndale Priority, she must not only overcome the resentment of the older nuns and head monks but has to deal with a murder also. The setting and characters give one a feeling of life in 13th century Britain as a good historical mystery should. I do believe that there should have been more information on the day to day workings of that time. Still, I was quite happy with the novel and would read the next in the series."
3,Not bad,"A new prioress has been appointed to the long established priory over the objections of the nuns in residence. She is immedialty beset with a murder and a few days later, another. Who among the ""holy"" would commit a murder? Interseting premise and investigation by the new prioess [a young tiny woman} with some skill at managing people. There is a bit too much discussion of praying to god for answers, so that I found it unpleasant to read portions. It was a bitl like being sermonized, but given the time and actual belief in praying as a cure for everything, it is understandable. Nevertheless, overall, a good story well told."
4,A Surprise,"I was quite honestly surprised by this book... I really did enjoy the read. The book will appeal most to avid fans of Medieval Europe, but the story can be appreciated by anyone. I will definitely read sequels in the future."
3,I agree with other reviews,"While I agree with the other reviews- ""It Was Okay"", ""Not Bad"", I thought the price was a little too high. It was an okay story with okay characters, but it was somewhat predictable. I would consider (for the right price) reading more novels by this author."
4,Smart writer,"Historical mysteries are very tricky. Finding the right tone compatible with the times without sounding stuffy. Creating characters that do not seem plucked from daily life, but not making them bloodless and unreal.And, maybe above all, not infusing the novel with your principals and believes.All and all, a very difficult task. Priscilla Royal's debut is a refreshing monastery book.Her colors and moods and smells are very authentic, her characters strong and interesting. The only trouble is the puzzle. It doesn't have natural progression, and resolves accidently.Those are the ills of a new writer. I am looking forward to see where she goes further."

2,Predictable,"With the other high reviews, I was expecting an exciting read. However, Wine of Violence was very predictable with few interesting twists in its slow plot. As for protraying a vivid picture of the medieval period, Wine of Violence again failed."
2,"Good suggestions, but.............","After incorporating all of Dr. Hedaya's suggestions into my life for quite some time, I've found that there was very little improvement over depression. I'll take the ""little improvement"" I can get, but, I don't yet forsee ever being able to function off of antidepressant medication."
4,a worthwhile addition to the depression library,"i am yet to act on dr hedayas recommendations, but i am very hopeful. the book is well written and gives the reader reassurance , it is a good idea to take it next time you see your doctor. i hope this is just the start of many books on this topic -- because neither depression or ads are about to go away!"
3,Out of Time,"Although Sakomizu's book is a thoroughly engaging read, it is, in my estimation, somewhat generic. It borrows heavily from ideas proposed in Bill Ostergard's 'The Wandering Eye' and often seems lacking in depth. That said, there is a great deal of wit and charm to keep the reader's attention. The author's coverage of the Swan Project is paraticularly enlightening. Fun, smart but ultimately light."
3,An insight into Wilt,"Provides an interesting insight into Wilt's mind, the game of basketball, and how it has changed over the years. Wilt is actually quite restrained throughout - I had hoped the book would be a bit more hard-hitting (though he does land a few punches!).Wilt's comments about the game and its players are a bit dated now, but my only real gripe about the book is that it's so disorganized! (He could have really used a writer to edit and reorganize the material. It takes some effort to slog though seemingly endless meanderings and ramblings.)At any rate, Wilt will sure be missed; the game today suffers without him!"
4,The Lost Salt Gift of Blood,"In an era when authors seem intent on outdistancing one another in the length of their works, it is such a treat to read Alistair MacLeod. His prose is poetic and not pretentious. He captures the beauty of the physical setting and depth of human feeling in a matter of two or three sentences, not two or three hundred words. This work touches the soul of the reader with its ability to portray deep human emotion and natural beauty in an easy-to-read prose. Congratulations, Alistair!"
1,great to read on a ennuied sunday afternoon when waiting to die,"is this what canadian lit is about? im so darn disappointed. this macleolo guy seems so damn constipated why cant he just take a laxative, instead of purging on paper non-sense sentences where fullstops are absent. im sure a 6 year old can write better than him, and that too at least it will be readable. what kind of a great achievement is writing 11 short stories and one novel in thirty-something years. Alexandre Dumas wrote over 300 volumes in that time! Mr McLeod, I dont think writing is ur forte. Go write kids books...ull save their parents the money for sleeping pills!"
5,REAL garage rock,"So many bands these days try to pass off as garage rock (the datsuns, the mooney suzuki) but this stuff is REAL. All of it is covers from the 50s just like the garage rockers of the 60s (the Sonics, The kingsman, The Troggs). The singer has a fantastic voice and the guitars go together wonderfully. great album pick it up."
5,"Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant, buy this now!","You've never heard of the Detroit Cobras? What a shame. This group out of (you guessed it) Detroit is a traditional rock and roll group covering oldies you have never heard, in a way you have never heard. Fronted by a female lead singer with a gritty but perfect voice, this group ROCKS! But more than that, they're FUN - every song they do is just great fun - perfect party music.I was turned onto this group by my wife, who has seen them play live (and met the singer in the bathroom afterward). After hearing how much she loved them, I bought all the CD's I could find of them, and we love them all. Highly recommended - you won't be disappointed!"
2,"Great band, bad lead singer","I thought I would like this band, and I do, but the lead singer can not sing. Sorry but she can not hold a tune. I like what this band is trying to do with the songs that they do, believe me I get it. But I cringe when I listen to the singing. Sorry."
2,Not great but not the worst,"Like most people, I was sold by the TV commercial. I had it for almost a year. I had other Steam cleaner and this one Scunii held steam more than my previous one. Scunii worked OK, not the best product. I wouldn't use this for stove or BBQ grill, it WON'T WORK as advertised. I can clean better with grill chemical and brush than this steam cleaner, BUT I used it mostly for bathroom toilet urine stains. Worked OK, but it definitely can use some more Steam pressure and temperature. I had previous experience with my other steam cleaner, therefore, I made sure to empty the water completely and dry before storing. After a year, it STOPPED working or heating. Product poorly made, I WOULD NOT recommend to pay over $15 for a new product."
4,Not Bad!,"I am quite impressed with this steamer. It does the job, but I would not recommend it for heavy duty cleaning/steaming. By the way the so called in the description ""the extra large water tank"" it is not so large, unless 11 ounces means ""extra large"" for you. I purchased this exact steamer and related attachments from CVS for $39.99 and I am pleased with the results I get for the price. However, I would have been very upset to buy this item for $123.99 as advertised by this Amazon seller (Action Packaged Inc.) and see the results I am seeing. Overall I would recommend this to my ""obsessed with cleaning"" friends, only if you were to pay for it what I paid."
2,Scunci Steam Cleaner,"It was with much excitement that I purchased this steam cleaner. The excitement quickly wore off when it wouldn't remove the mildew in my shower or the soap scum on the doors. It also failed to remove mold in the crevice of my kitchen tile. This was just routine cleaning and it couldn't handle it.The only item this cleaned well was my bbq grill, and it did do that well.If you are going to buy one don't. If you own one sell it, take the money to Target and buy yourself some nice harsh chemicals."
1,Wack!,"Bought this for my girlfriend for christmas last year, she gave it back to me in a week and never asked for it again, i used it once, it's been in the closet ever since."
5,Great product,The product is great and the delivery was fast and reliableI have receive it 10 days ahead of the scheduled deliveryI am very satisfied with my purchase at amazon.com
2,It doesn't last!,"I bought this about a year ago and it worked great. I cleaned all kinds of gunk and I liked it.When I tried to use it last week, however, it seems to be frozen up and the steam does not shoot out anymore.My hubby finally took it apart (what's to lose?) and found that the button that you push to release the steam is all frozen up with calcium deposits from the water.Why didn't they advise us to use distilled water? And it says NOT to use vinegar to clean it....why?So now my money is down the drain and I'm out a bundle because I bought the ""free"" carry bag, for which they charged me exhorbitant shipping costs.Don't waste your money!"
1,It SUCKS!,"You can get more cleaning done with a brillo pad and soap. It does not dissolve any grease. It just blows air on it. I brought it back for a refund. If you buy it, make sure you can return it because this thing sucks."
1,Garbage!,I just pulled the steamer out of the closet to clean a spot off of my chair and found it is so corroded inside it won't work now. What a piece of...
2,not particularly hot,"i just got this steamer, hoping to blast away dirt and grease ""with the power of steam"" (per the infomercial). Instead I got luke warm smoke and spit sputtering out the nozzle. I don't know if the steam cools down on the way out, but the steam was not hot, and the grease stayed put (though it did become wet).With your money, just buy some 409."
1,Does not last long,I bought an SS1000 when it was $70. The first one failed after six months. I called Scunci and they sent a replacement under warranty. That one lasted about four months. They sent a third under warranty. I sold the third one on Craigslist for $40 without opening the box.The customer service is very good and I was impressed that they do honor the warranty with no fuss. I replaced the Scunci with a Eureka Enviro-Steamer 370A for $100. The Eureka has more capacity than the Scunci and still works great after several years. It's good to hear that others are paying $35 for the Scunci. That is more in line with its worth.
2,Just gets the tight places,"I used the steamer in tight and hard to get places or crevices where dirt settles in and is hard to bring out, this was helpful. Anything else didn't make much of a difference. I live in a small space and feel the value of this device can't keep it's space in mine. I'm returning it tomorrow or the next."
2,Heating element failed after 4 months of use,The Scunci SS1000 is cheaply constructed of materials that simply caused the unit to fail. Avoid this brand until the quality improves.
3,decent cleaner for price,"While not a great cleaner, it is certainly worth the $35. Mine just died after 1.5 years. If it were an expensive cleaner, I would be rather irate now, but for the price, it gave me 1.5 years of good cleaning. Especially good on grout, I also used it to take pet and other stains out of carpet. Does great at cleaning the woodwork, too. Overall, I can say you get more than you pay for."
2,Steamer is great BUT,"I am in love with this steamer. I have bought several from different suppliers. One sent me a used One!! it was full of old rusty water, and sealed shut. They replaced it with another unit that was much cleaner, but I still suspect it was used. Bought another for my mom from another company and it was clear this had been sitting on the shelf for a very long time in a hot warehouse. item was extremely old stock and peices missing. company gave refund. I finally went IN PERSON to a LOCAL store to OPEN THE BOX in the store. (target) before i finally found a NEW clean machine. The machine itself is AWESOME! does a multitude of jobs. I cant sing its praises highly enough. Be careful on price, it varies widely. Just do yourself a favor and buy it from a spot you can inspect it personally."
2,oh well,"I bought one of these steam ""cleaners"" about a year ago.It did a so-so job at first; I have to admit it did melt grease off of the stove and make it easier to wipe away if you could avoid burning yourself.It was kinda fun watching the hot air (steam) pushing the gunk around, but I ususally found it just pushed the gunk into a place that was even harder to get to.My real gripe was that it stopped working after just over a year. After not using it for a month or so, I tried to use it and the internal valve was stuck and it just turned into a bomb waiting to explode. I quickly unplugged it and left the room. When it cooled I examined the innards and realized the cheap metal alluminum valve was seized up.I had always used filtered water in it even though our municipal water supply is low in mineral content, but the flimsy parts just failed.In da trash she goes! Lesson learned."
1,Blew Up,"This item spat a little water out of the nozzle on 3d use, then the hose blocked up and separated from the body forcibly. Lucky I did not get burned."
1,Don't purchase this item,"My fault, just took the steamer out after over a year. It has never been used and won't be. It doesn't work. No steam comes out at all. Steam builds up but won't come out and the water smelled like moth balls. Brand new and in the trash."
4,Nice Steamer,I use this to clean the shower on a regular basis. I does do a good job but be careful not to use the wire brushes on tile. It will leave scratches. I do have to scrub with your normal cleaning solutions though at times but for a quick job if your shower does not get too dirty this will do the job.
5,Scunci SS1000 Hand hel Steam Cleaner,"This is the second scunci steam cleaner I have purchased. I purchased this one for my lake house. I use my steamer all the time for cleaning windows, sanitiziing bathrooms, counter tops, etc. It has always done a wonderful job & I rated it very highly."
2,Mediocre product,"I used this machine for a couple years, not excessively but just for tough cleaning jobs and sterilizing carpets/upholstery. It did a fine job & I really liked it until the unit broke without warning - my guess is the switch went out. I definitely wouldn't buy another one like it."
4,"Priced well, works as advertised, and simple to install","I'm somewhat amused by the previous review. If you cut yourself twice using simple scissors to open a plastic box, then perhaps home improvement is not your forte. Based on that, I would question the reviewer's credibility, your call.It was simple to install (less than 10 minutes, comes with stickers to label the wires, and instructions are as good as any you'd expect) and it works as advertised. If you don't need a bunch of bells and whistles (we did not need each day programmed differently) and want an accurate digital reading, I recommend this. The Hunter brand when it comes to fans is stalwart, so I bought this with that in mind."
4,Godd for the money,"Not bad at all. The instructions weren't even close for wire labels on my (granted, quite old) thermostat. However, I still managed to get it right after reading some statements about what things NOT to do. Just read it and take your time. After I got it hooked up, it worked awesome, and the batteries are really easy to change. One happy customer."
2,Didn't last long.,"Worked OK for a couple years. Now the ""up"" button stopped working and I have to shop for a replacement."
3,Vegan,I'm looking for a Vegan cook book that has ingredients I'm familiar with. All of them have foods I have never heard of and am afraid to try.
2,disappointing,"I bought this book thinking I could use it to make some good vegan meals. I was very disappointed by it because although the recipes do look tempting and interesting and exotic, they are not practical - one would have to buy too many 'strange' ingredients to make them. In the end I just kept getting frustrated looking through it, because all these ideas she presents were not realistic, so I returned it. There may be one or two good recipes, but there are better vegan cookbooks out there."
5,GREAT BOOK,"I just recently made the transition from vegetarianism to vegan and was looking for some good meal ideas. This book is awesome! I would recommend it to anyone, whether you're an advanced chef or a beginner."
5,best dog shampoo,This shampoo smells great and gets rid of the dog smell. The scent lasts for a long time too! Best dog shampoo that I have found. Wont use anything else.
3,"Ingredients are not listed, otherwise OK.","I have no problems with this product and it seems gentle and with a pleasant scent, but amazingly the ingredients are NOT listed on the bottle.This is not acceptable in today's day and age. I'd give it 4 stars otherwise. I was tempted to call them and complain, but not worth my time.Given that they say ""OK for humans, too"" on the label, they really need to tell us what is in it."
2,16 year old from New Jersey,This book did not help me at all. The maps were confussing and i really just had to play the game on my own and find the secrets without the help of the book. But the video game is awsome and i highly recomend Turok 2
1,Worst choice - useless,"I bought couple of these and for both I noticed they quickly deteriorated after couple of weeks. The lamplight became dim and I was wondering if I am slowly getting blind. I examined the bulbs and noticed the tube tarnished inside by a mirror-black residue - presumable film from metal evaporation, because it was not there when I bought them. When you turn the light on, it takes couple of seconds to light up, when turned off - it continues glowing for up to five seconds. This is not how halogen bulbs should be!I replaced the Feit bulb with another brand and guess what? The non-Feit 150W bulb is BRIGHTER than the Feit 300W!Do not buy Feit halogen bulbs."
5,"A sane, safe book to help your kids regarding sexual mores","I was in the 8th grade in 1971 when I studied this book, along with Charlie Shedd's ""Letters to Phillip"" in a ""Human Theory"" class. Thank you mommy for giving me permission to take that class! If you can find the book, buy it!"
4,As I Lay Dying,Faulkner at his best & easiest to read. Ordered it for a book club review & gained new readers for Faulkner. (And customers for Amazon; not available locally)
3,Confusing but pretty good,"I think that the book was pretty good. It definately was confusing in the very beginning but as you kept reading you got used to the different style to the writing. I would definately recommend this bood to someone. If you have the time defianatley read ""As I Lay Dying."""
1,Unbelievably overrated,"Yeah, I know, this is considered by many to be one of the greatest novels of the 20th century. And yeah, I know, there are people who will say that I just don't get Faulkner. I admit it. I don't. I find his work, and this novel in particular, essentially unreadable. Even for people who like or are impressed by Faulkner's style, I'm not sure what it is about this novel that keeps them interested. Neither the characters nor the story is even remotely compelling.Years after reading this book, I learned that Faulkner only spent 6 weeks writing it. That explains a lot.Paul Gehrman, Author, Kaleidoscope"
1,Was not impressed,The writing made this a difficult read until you are able to comprehend the style which occurred to me halfway through the book. I did not find the book a gripping read in any way.
4,Bought for College,"I purchased this when I found out I needed it for an American Literature course and was worried that it wouldn't arrive before I needed it (as it didn't offer any sort of quick shipping); however, it arrived well before it was scheduled to and for the books age, my copy was from 1987, it was in remarkable condition aside from the natural yellowing over time and some highlighting other students had done before me (which I view as an aide rather than a hindrance). I was briefly worried as my professor wanted a specific edition (Vintage) and the cover I got didn't match hers which is the one I thought I was getting as it was the one pictured, but the books appear to be otherwise identical."
2,"Sorry, but I don't think it merits more than 2 stars...","This book is sad and hopeless. The entire tone is about death and dying and the unhappy people surrounding it. The character Darl is interesting, and Faulker's unique conveying of the story from different viewpoints as the book unfolds is what I feel is what makes for the sensational reviews. Although I understand many find this a work of literary genius, I don't feel it merits that much enthusiasm. This is essentially a unhappy story about sad people transporting a dead woman's body across a broken society. It does have it's creative points, but a reader looking for a good story to invest their time in reading would find better stories elsewhere."
1,As I Die Reading,"Man, this book is not written for the reader. The story is fascinating, sure, but that's after reading a lot of notes, and listening to a lot of criticism. Why couldn't the issues like the pregnancy, who was speaking, jeez, was Jewel a boy or girl, a brother or sister, how many times did you have to reread to figure out what the hell was going on. Sure, for those of you who got it, you liked it, but that was after having a professor tell you how great it was. On its own, this book would slowly die out. Clarity is important in writing. This book is muddled."
5,Favorite,"One of the best books I've ever read. Mercilessly funny. A former viewer is exactly right that this is Cohn brothers territory, though I don't think it would translate easily to the screen."
1,Could not finish it 2nd time around.,"I read this book about 20 years ago in high school and hated it. I just tried to read it again for a book club discussion. I thought that 20 years of life experience and growth may have changed my attitude toward this classic. It didn't. I made it half way through and decided to quit wasting my time. The characters are self-serving, and I just didn't care about them. The stream of consciousness style of writing is not my thing."
3,As I Lay Dying - review,"Faulkner's, As I Lay Dying, is slow and confusing, but eventually will grow on you. Different characters at certain points in the plot present the novel to you. You eventually become accustom to the form of stream of conscious narrative in this Novel. The slowness has mostly to do with the language used and the topic. The characters are basically the slums of white society in the old south, and old southern language is exactly what you read. The detail given is drawn out as well. These two elements make for long and boring reading. The novel is about a woman who dies, and her wish to be buried in Jefferson is carried out by her family. The novel describes their trials along the way. The dysfunction of her family isn't exactly my slice of pie to read about."
1,boring,I only bought this book because it was required for a literature project for my daughter's class. It was the most boring thing that she has ever read
4,May Not Have Otherwise Read,"Classic fiction really isn't my cup of tea. I did really enjoy Faulkner's ""stream of consciousness"" writing style. At first, I really fell into the story and the plight of the characters. Then I began to lose interest with the slow pace of the plot. However, towards the end, the drama increased and I got back into the story. There were some amazing lines of thought in the story that really made me think. I think my favorite was a line from Addie Bundren ""... and that sin and love and fear are just sounds that people who never sinned nor loved nor feared have for what they never had and cannot have until they forget the words."" Overall, As I Lay Dying was a dark novel that is deeply moving and lyrical at times, and sharply to-the-point and simple at others. Glad I read it."
4,A classic,"I read this for my English 111 class at the University of Washington and, though it's not my favorite (check out The Fox and the Hound by Daniel P. Mannix, it's amazing), it was definitely an interesting and challenging read. I would recommend it."
2,I LOVE this book BUT...,"I have read this book in the paper edition and wanted to have it on my kindle as it's one of my favorite books. I bought this and was very excited until I got to reading it and discovered this is the ""corrected version"". I prefer to read a book in the way the writer wrote it, not corrected. No where in the description does it say it's corrected. I am unable to locate a kindle edition that states it's not corrected so I'm hesitant on purchasing another."
3,never completely understood it,I had to read this book for my senior Ap English class and so I did. I finished the book but I don't think I ever completely understood that Darl was crazy and Jewel was the hero. I have to figure out the theme of this book and I am still struggling to understand it. I would definitely recommend reading it slowly or read it twice.
2,No need to pick up,"It was a bit painful to read at some points, but in the end I was able to look back a get something from the novel. th dark humor was laughable only after the novel was read."
3,More style than substance,"The book ""As I Lay Dying"" is difficult to navigate, because it takes a long while to understand which characters are which. Faulkner narrates the story from each character's point of view for each chapter. It's well-constructed but it took me over half the book to understand who the children were, who the husband was, and who the friends were. It was a struggle to understand Faulkner's vocabulary too. But the last 75 pages of the book are really good and I liked how it ended. This was the first Faulkner book I read and I don't think I would read any more of his work, but I am glad I read this book and was introduced to Faulkner's work."
3,A hard read not without its rewards....(3.5 stars),"After reading Faulkner one wonders what compels a man to create such a unique and discerning literary style. As I Lay Dying continues Faulkner multi-voice style as it examines the life of Bundren family as they set on a trip to bury their matriarch. What we get is multiple points of view from all of the families. Each one is a minor slice of life that adds up to the complete pie. At times it can very puzzling as it takes multiple chappters (and subsequent re-reading) to understand the nuances and role of each character. There is a lot of emotion and power to the prose and Faulkner can never be repeated or successfully imitated.In general Faulkner is challenging and I always feel like I'm missing something both times I've finished reading one of his books. For readers who like trying to put together pieces of puzzle then I recommend Faulkner and As I Lay Dying was more straightforward than The Sound and the Fury and Absalom, Absalom."
1,This book is terrible!!,"Yes, the language is easier to understand as you go along, but, truthfully, why would you want to? The story is silly, the characters are even sillier, and the ending is completely confusing. I am a high school student, in an advanced class, and I really don't see the value of the book. You have to grasp for straws to find meaning, and it's not really worth all the energy."
5,Exactly What I Needed,"Just a note to say I was very pleased with my purchase of ""As I Lay Dying"" from Amazon! This was my first Amazon purchase, and I was a little leery about buying a book for a penny (thought it might arrive bound by duct tape) but the book was in excellent condition! Thanks so much; I am now an Amazon fan for life!"
2,beautiful imagery but not much more,"I appreciate Faulkner's vivid imagery in his writing, but I am not a fan of this novel. I cannot seem to get interested in any of the characters, or the plot. I can't relate to any of the characters because I can't even get to the point where I know them. Perhaps, it is the devices, such as stream of consciousness and dialect, that he uses. I've heard he's been compared to Toni Morrison, and I really liked The Bluest Eye, but I really cannot seem to enjoy this book at all, just appreciate it for it's style."
2,BLLLAAAAHHH!!,"I had to read this book for my second semester Honors Literature class at Northern Arizona University, and I respectfully disagree with all other reviewers that praised this work. I found it dreadfully dull and boring, and loathed reading my daily self-allotment of pages each night. The personality quirks of the characters were ridiculously aggrandized, particularly that of Clara. If you're looking for something better than dull - this book is a must-skip."
1,A struggle to get through,"First off I am baffled at how many people like this book. You know a book is written poorly when you have to go on to sparknotes.com just to figure out who the characters are and what the hell is going on. Clear is something this book is not. What is with the round about ways of saying things? Is it that difficult to just say what you mean. Ok maybe it's because I'm not a English Lit major and I didn't have my professor explaining every sentence to me which is what I could really use to get through this book. I don't care for any of the characters and the story line is just plain boring or at least I imagine it is if I knew what was going on. I like reading books with themes and symbolism and I have even been referred to as a ""book snob"" but maybe this book is just over my head."
1,One of the worst novels I have ever read,"This is definatly one of the worst books I have ever read. Faulkner must have just accidently wrote a book or something. The storyline is that the mother of a family dies and they take her to a city to be buried, except it is much boring boring than that and much more disgusting and Faulkner drags it out over about 50 chapters. This book is boring, disgusting, and barely even makes sense. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone but Satan himself."
5,"A Grim, Morbid, and Compelling Tale","Wow! This novel is quite morbid, and grim. Probably most analogous with some of Cormac McCarthy's more dark epics. You read on to see how low this family can sink into a depraved, stingy, and heartless abyss. Faulkner was certainly a genius."
3,First Faulkner Experience,"This book is the first William Faulkner book I have ever read, and I am still not sure what I think of him. It got off to a slow start, and admittedly, it took me nearly half the book to get used to his writing style. Once I hit the mid-point, though, it seemed to go quicker, and the bits and pieces of the story coming together were wonderful. I certainly wouldn't recommend this book to someone who has never been to college...as silly as it sounds, some of the skills I picked up in my Lit classes are all that kept me ploughing through this book."
3,Okay,This book retained my interest but wasn't the best . I expected so much more since I have heard Faulkner is sooo awesome. ????
4,Bleak,"While filled with great prose, memorable passages, and not a single dull character, I hesitate to rate this book too highly (for what probably amounts to purely personal reasons. For example, the prose sounds ancient in the best of ways, as if ripped from out of the dirt the story takes place on, but it's also intentionally biblical in sound, a prose style I'm not too fond of. Then again, I'm probably just making up excuses when really I just can't stand how bleak the story is. Seriously, be warned if your queasy. It gets rough.)Also, Addie's chapter is up there as one of my favorites in all of literature. It's fantastic, and As I Lay Dying should be read by everyone just for that one segment of it. (And, interesting sidenote, another one of my favorite chapters in literature is the first from 1Q84, another book I hesitate to rate to highly, but for entirely different reasons, and another book i still find fantastic.)"
3,relieved!,"Survived this faulkner work. Feel unqualified to go farther. Its been suggested to try his short stories, I might try them, but I could not call reading faulkner a pleasure, more like hard work."
2,As I Lay Dying,"Read this for my book group; disappointed in it. Expected more from such a renowned writer but perhaps I missed the point of the story???? Have to say though, I was caught up in it after the first half and eager to keep reading. Does that contradict my first two sentences???"
3,Talk about your bad days!,"This family which tries to bury one of its own by her request goes through all sorts of turbulance. If you liked Grapes of Wrath, you will like this."
2,defective product,"This is not the first item I have received paying for a new product only to find the book was an irregular (damaged in production) book that no book store could ever sell!! I find it amazing that Amazon would accept a book whose pages were not cut properly, and then sell it as a book that is in first class condition!!!! I am sure that you hope that I need this book immediately (which I do) so that I will not return this ""defective"" book. Since I have to use it immediately, I have not returned it, but this review is to warn others about your deceitful tactics."
2,Not for leisure reading,"Faulkner uses vivid descriptions and varying narrations to tell this odd tale. Despite the seemingly clear-cut style in which this book is written (the chapter title denotes the narrator), it can often seem confusing, and the story is not told in chronological order. Although the ironies and humor found in the novel do not compensate for faults, they do make the story stand out and memorable. This book requires much patience to interpret the personalities of the characters to fully appreciate this novel, if that is possible."
2,great insight,"I read this preposterous book in high school, got the point of it but I still can't scrape off the impression that it's a fancy angle on daytime drama; the characters, with the exception of Darl, haven't come into relief for me even years after I finished reading the story. The best Faulkner can to with this superficial tale is to obfuscate the plot enough that the readers are forced to pay way more attention to his writing than it merits."
2,This book sucked!,As a high schooler I was forced to read this book for anassignment. I found it one of the most boring books I have ever read.It lead nowhere and was grueling reading.
5,A Perfect Work Of Art,"A testament to human endurance. Faulkner wrote this one in his spare time (while working 12-hour days)in a matter of weeks. The narrative structure (simpler than Sound And The Fury)allows glimpes of a tormented, fascinating inward eternity only Faulkner could achieve. Never read a Faulkner book? Begin here!"
4,This book expanded my view like none else.,"I read this book for my AP Senior English class and thought it a little grusome at times but also brilliant. But I am writing this to clear something up. When Vardaman says; ""My mother is a fish,"" it is a Christian symbol of dying and coming back again. When Addie dies, Vardaman believes she came back as the fish and will continue to do so as the fish is always replenished."
3,I'd Rather Lay Dying...,"Yes. Faulkner considers this book one of his best. Yes. The English Language is used artistically. However - this book is a waste of time. The reading is tedious and grueling - often, a reader must stop at every line, considering what has happened, and rarely - if ever - do you know exactly what is going on. Of course, that was Faulkner's point in writing this - to demonstrate a story woven around the use of inner monologues and not the typical third person approach. But I'd rather lay dying than read this book. If you do want a good example of Faulkner - read his short story, A Rose for Emily. Faulkner is in top form in his short fiction, not his books, and certainly not this one."
2,nothing but daytime drama,"I read this preposterous book in high school, got the point of it and identified with the Darl character but got into it emotionally. In fact, I still can't scrape off the impression that it's a fancy angle on daytime drama; the characters, with the exception of Darl, haven't come into relief for me even years after I finished reading the story. The best Faulkner can to with this superficial tale is to obfuscate the plot enough that the readers are forced to pay way more attention to his writing than it merits."
2,This book is confusing,Im 17 and am pretty intelligent but when i read this book for my AP class I didnt understand what was going on to the extent that i would have liked. I dont see the point in making what could be a humurous and vibrant description of an unusual occurence into a laborious chore to read. The lack of cronological order is very annoying and i dont see why Faulkner did it that way unless he wanted to make people angry. I would not recommend this book unless you have great comprhension and read at a very high level.
2,Reading List,"A really confusing book. If it wasn't on my reading list, I don't know that I would have finished it."
1,Ehh.....,"This was the first book I read by Faulkner and did not leave a good impression at all. I was attracted by the concept, which was hardly adressed throughout the book. It is told through vignettes of different characters and their perception of what is happening, which is an amazing idea and I loved it greatly. However, I found that the book circled the ""story"" and ""point"" a lot, instead of keeping to it. A lot of the vignettes have no relevance but character development, which is good...just not when it interferes with the overall ""story"". I dragged my attention through this book, and regretfully the only parts that could intrigue me was the beginning and the end...the core was just a simple story of an eventless journey. I guess the best way to describe this story is: Imagine writing about a long family road trip...long, scenarically devoid, and dead. ""As I Lay Dying"" relates to the reader dying from boredom."
2,"Depressing, boring, frustrating","I see Oprah just picked this as a book club selection. Oh lord.... Why does she always pick such depressing books? We had to read this and other of Faulkner's books (I remember Absolom, Absolom very well) in high school. They were depressing then, and they are depressing (and boring) now. I don't know why English teachers and that whole establishment keep shoving them down our throats. The way this book is organized makes it frustrating to read. In school, teachers would excuse that and say that the difficulty was one of Faulkner's ""devices,"" but heaven help us students if what we wrote for class wasn't absolutely clearly organized. If you buy this, good luck--and keep the antidepressants handy."
4,"Short read, but good","I usually don't like Faulkner, but this book was quick and easy to follow. The differing narratives gave a lot of life to the story and the dialects and personalities within didn't really take away from the plot going on. Overall the plot of taking the mother to be buried seemed like a vehicle to use the device of multiple narratives.I can see why it's a classic, but personally it isn't my cup of tea."
4,What the ...?,"I agree with Mr. Schildberg. This is a love-or-leave-it type of offering. I give major kudos to ""Mr. Mike's Mondo Video"" for cluing me into Klaus Nomi: The 'dream sequence' which features him performing the aria from 'Samson and Delilah'. Overall, it's really cool slices of twisted stuff/humor. Not for everybody."
4,You Know Who You Are!!!,"Church of Jack Lord. Laser bras. Cat swimming. Sid Vicious not singing ""My Way"". Root Boy Slim singing to a lounge full of blow-up sex dolls. This wasn't ready for late night commercial television in 1979. Not quite so sure they are ready for it in 2013. This piece stands as the epitaph for the macabre mind that was Michael O'Donoghue. May God have mercy on your soul, Michael!"
1,"Don't Bother, Even If You're a Fan","I was amazed and delighted watching live that first year of SNL when it launched in 1975. Prior to that, I was a fan of Michael O'Donaghue when he wrote for National Lampoon magazine, and I would listen over and over again to 8-track tapes I recorded of the Radio Hour (Don't you think... or don't you? Even my wife now occasionally uses the phrase ""ironing the oak tree"" because I said it years ago. I wonder if Michael wrote those words.)This video is a near-complete waste of time. Nothing funny at all here. The only thing mildly interesting is the commentary track, a fellow writer talked about Michael, (but not a whole lot about what we were seeing.)"
3,Needs a manual!!,"This is a wonderful product IF you can figure out how to make it do everything it can. It has an electronic manual located on the disc but it's irritating to have to switch back and forth to find what you're looking for. I've even called Disney offering to pay to have them ship a manual to me, but they claim the only one available is the one on the disc. It's a lot of fun but be ready to do a lot of switching back and forth. I definitely would have given it 5 stars if not for this problem."
3,disney dvd,"I thought my daughter will like it ... but not as much as i expected. she spent sometime playing with it, but may be it is a bit complicated for her age .... she is 5.5 years, she liked another product better."
3,Great product if only I could use it on my computer!,Disney Magic Artist StudioVery disappointed when I received this. In the product details it said was compatible with 'Mackintosh' It does not work on my Apple Mac (Mac OS X Version 10.4.116) Gave the CD ROM to my mum as it works on her PC. My 3 year old daughter can now only play with it when she's there. Actual product is fantastic - there is lots to do - one of the best on the market.
1,Not Mac compatible,I received the CD ROM in the mail abut... it didn't work because my computer is a Mac (Apple). On the product description it lists the many systems that it is compatible with including Macs (listed 2nd after Linux). Unfortunately this is not true. My little daughter was so disappointed when the program wouldn't work on our Mac computer. Amazon must take care of putting the correct information over their products.
1,will NOT work on MAC,"the item is listed as working on a mac, but the version sent is only for pc - I have to send it back."
2,First disappointment from Sarah Leah Chase,"Sarah Leah Chase is a great cook and author. Every recipe of hers I've ever tried is a winner. This book, however, was disappointing. Save your money and buy her ""Open House Cookbook"" or ""Cold-Weather Cooking"" instead."
5,quick review,i thought Kestrel for a knave was a really great book. don't read it if you are looking for a fairytale and a happy ending. this book is about real life and the terrible hardships of a young innocent boy. i highly recommend it. it really made me think about how lucky i am. read the book and see the film too.
1,I hate it !!!,This game is the worst. I mean easy level is to easy and the hard level they prob programed it to hit a home run every inning it [stinks] !!! all it dose is cause stress . I recomend games buy EA games. Sega flat out [stinks] !!!!!
1,What a dumb game,"Dont buy it. one time I hit a ball and it went up the middlle. the announcer said"" down the 3rd base line. it stupid"
1,Horrible,"This game has got to be the worst game I have played in my life. If I could have given this game lower than one star, then I would have. Its so unrealistic. Every time you swing, no matter how out of time it is, you get a homerun. In the first inning that I played, I got 34 points. No offence, but those people who gave this game a high score must have never really played the game. Anyway, don't buy this game!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Terrible!,This game is terrible! The only good thing about this game is the graphics! You can hit every pitch and there is no fun to this game because you hit a hoomerun every other batter. When you play your friends the final score is usually 30-29! IT IS SOOOOOOO BORING! A rent if anything!
3,weird green....and cracked,"I love the size and shape, but the shade of green is a little weird. And sadly, it cracked."
4,The Dot and the Line,"I don't know why, but I was under the impression that this was a children's book. It's not. It's a math lover's book. The book itself was ridiculously hard for me to find, so I was glad when I finally got my hands on it, but again, huge letdown that this isn't a quirky little kid's book about dots and lines and basic geometry. The font is difficult to read at times, although the design quality, simplistic as it is, is superb. The story itself is pretty simplistic, but so very complicated in its simplicity. The puns, the symbolism, make for a good read."
4,An A+ from a student,"We used this book in our math class. It was a wonderful explanation of how simple geometry works.What the books about:This book is about a Line, a Dot, and a Sqiggle. It shows you how the three relate, and differnt things you can do with them mathmatically, throgh the medium of a classic love story.Its a wonderful book and i suggest you read it, even if your not in a math class. I also hear there is a short cartoon bassed off of it."
3,don't buy this book-copy of original one-PRICES OUT OF LINE,"AGAIN I SAY DON'T BUY THIS NEW BOOK, if you have the original one with the same name - BECAUSE IT HAS THE SAME PHOTOS !!! and the prices are out of line - totally wrong -....the author did nothing but add prices that are not current - and made a carbon copy of her original book without any new SUPER LOOKING VINTAGE LUCITE - BAKELITE BAGS...that you can find on the internet .....without wasting your money - sorry - but the original is a great book - without prices....and the new one is a way of letting the new collector think they have a ""new book"" with a ""price guide"" that is up to date - unfortunate - want to buy my copy cheap? A Certain Style is a stunning book to own for Lucite-Bakelite collectors....."
4,Thought-provoking analysis,"This is not a book for the general reader--it requires some interest in and aptitude for philosophical writing. But I actually found it great fun to read--I especially liked the witty asides and turns of phrases that peppered this quite serious analysis of the relationship between ideology and modernity. By ideology, Minogue includes not only Marxism, but also contemporary political theories such as feminism and other movements that posit the modern world as essentially a system of oppressive structures of domination. His point is that much ideological thinking is not only toxic, but that it is ultimately a form of magical or mystical thinking that seems at bottom to constitute a protracted curse on modernity. Minogue notes that ideology became a substitution faith in the twentieth century, but I would have liked to see a little more examination of the way in which the spiritual void that seemed to accompany modernity made this possible."
1,Don't bother sending for this one.,"Just in looking at the sample pages I decided this book was not worth sending for. A good example is ""Agua Potable"".....translated to ""Potable water"" in English. Ask the typical American for Potable Water and 9 out of 10 people won't know what you're talking about. Ask those same people for Drinking Water and you'll get a response.The translations are very poor, and obviously not done by a native English speaker."
4,"Not a full picture but useful, especially for the specialist","This would be a difficult book to understand for someone not already familiar with the life of Jelly Roll Morton. Focusing on the years Morton spent in California in the 1910s and 1930s, particularly at the beginning, the book focuses on how recent information on Jelly's life on the West Coast sheds new light's personal life on Morton and adds to consensus that despite harrowing conditions, illness that would become fatal, that in the late 1930s Morton was writing some very advanced music that was unfortunately neither recorded nor performed in his lifetime.Be brave and muscle your way through the first part of this book which contains a bit more speculation than this reader would have preferred.The book to start on Morton is _Jelly's Blues: The Life, Music, and Redemption of Jelly Roll Morton_by Howard Reich"
5,sweet,I got this for my mom -- she LOVES it and plays it all the time. Gentle music with smooth segues.
2,"Not as good, some helpful tips though","While it provides some useful tips for better essays for GRE, some sample essays are logically flawed. (yes, I was surprised to find that out while the author claimed he wrote the essays ""not"" within time frame). For example. Page 68. Sample Response for issue 1. Moreover, ETS has edited their pools of topic and the topic won't allign with the sample responses in the book. The book's claimed up to date web-page is not up to date either. May be because it has been 6 years from the date of publication.So I would suggest you to study official PowerPrep from ETS first. It really helps. After all, they are the one who's gonna test you. So you gotta play their game to score.Then, if you still have time and some bucks (around $ 15.00) buy this book and read. Good luck with your GRE or GMAT. Cheers :)"
4,"Good, but not as great as other reviewers claim","This book is useful for understanding what the GRE is asking for and providing clues on rhetorical devices to use. However, I can't verify that what it tells you is correct, since I only received a 4.0 score. Additionally, the book is a little out of date but this only really effects the description of the test rather than its advice."
3,Not a ...toy,"I got this for my son (3 yrs) because he really likes Sulley. Fortunately I got it on a good sale so I am not too disappointed. Sulleys movement and vocabulary are both pretty limited, which in turn limits the play value of this toy."
2,NOT the RIGHT Movie,I ordered Guns of Honor and everything says that(the box the DVD & the paperwork) but the DVD is Trigger Fast movie (the second one of two movies made for TV(about A feisty woman struggles to keep her ranch from being stolen by a greedy and unscrupulous land-baron))So I was upset that I did not get the one I payed for. It was still OK for a made for TV western.
1,Wrong movie,"Guns of HonorIt's the wrong movie than is described in the description and the back of the case. I bought this movie and it is the same as Trigger Fast, another JT Edson book, that stars Dusty Fog."
2,Diehard Edson fans only,"Warning the DVD is Trigger Fast...NOT Guns of Honor.These moves were a two part made for television mini-series very losely based on two novels by J.T. Edson (The Ysabel Kid and Trigger Fast). The books are far better than the movie.I suggest this movie only for those ignorant of JT Edson and his floating outfit characters (and love cheesy 'B' westerns) or those who are diehard Dusty Fog and Ysabel Kid fans. The actors chosen for Dusty and Loncey are reasonable selections for their characters. So if you want a chance to see them come to life it is worth suffering through the terrible and cheesy plots. However, if you are a Mark Counter or Waco fan...run away and never watch these. I depsise the actor chosen to play Mark Counter and how they drastically altered his character. Plus Waco is replaced with some Spanish character named Miguel. This is a poor attempt to bring to film the Floating Outfit novels. Hopefully someday a much better version will be attempted."
3,Guns of Honor - not really,Purchased the GUNS OF HONOR: Sale went well and item received before due date which was good. PLEASE NOTE: this was a completely different movie to what is described on the cover which was disappointing.
1,Falsified Product Title,"If I order product A, I'm not really expecting to receive product B.First, that would be ""Trigger Fast"" not ""Guns Of Honor""Second, that's very likely the worst screenplay ever made from a book I enjoyed. The book, not the movie ..."
2,Wrong movie,The movie on the DVD is not the one described on the back of the box. The movie on the back of the box is the first of the two movies made about Dusty Fog and crew and the DVD shows the second. The movie is good but not what you are expecting to see. This happnens when you get the DVD from any source.
2,Nice picture book,"I checked this book out at a local book store. It might be a good resource for a costume designer or fashion maven, but contains no ""real"" information (very little text, no explanations of clothing styles or traditions, etc.)."
1,One roll not 50/box,One roll received. making a false description as saying 50 rolls per box.If it is for one roll then it is too expensive. I would not ordered it.
5,Well..,"It's okay. Not as well explained as I'd hoped. Would have like to learn more about the monsters, instead of nature."
1,Awful.,"Dull, outdated, stuffy, difficult to follow, absurd premise, totally outdated. I can't think of anymore to say about it because it's unworthy of anymore."
3,Its informative,The book gives a great argument about whether or not mythic creatures actually existed would have been better with some illustrations...but that's what u get with the e-book
3,Not quite there!!!,"These performances are just average!I have recordings of heifetz on tapes and they are great.I have also the exquisite performances by Perlman and Ashkenazy,perhaps the best!Here Kremer and Argerich (individually they may be great!)do not seem to be combining at all.added to this the flow of the music is interrupted by quixotic changes in tempo and dynamics.just not inspiring.Particularly the SPRING sonata is a big let down.Here Perlman and Ashkenazy combine perfectly to give a soaring lyrical reading.Just matchless!i would recommend The perlman and Ashkenazy as the best choice for these sonatas."
2,cd was ok but only one woody cartoon in it,cd was ok but only one woody cartoon in it. I purchased it thinking I will be able to see the woody gems back after 20 odd years but alas. just one woody cartoon and that too very crappy where woody appeared for less than 2 mins.
3,The lesser of two Woodys (read before buying this one!),"GENIUS ENTERTAINMENT issued their _____ and other Cartoon Treasures series in two formats:1.) A 90-minute disc packed in a heavy paper jacket (as this one is),and2.) a plastic slimline cased DVD containing 2 full hours of cartoons.The superior 2-hour version ofWOODY WOODPECKER AND OTHER CARTOON TREASUREScontains all the shorts found here, plus several more.(see my review by clicking on title)"
5,Very Well Done,"This is the first Gospel/Christian CD I have ever purchased. I'm not a deeply religeous person, but I so enjoyed this CD, I stayed up way past my bedtime listening to it. My favorites are Hosanna, Brighter Day, Lookin' Out For Me, and Don't Cry, which by the time it's finished you can't help but to cry! Each song is beautiful and there is something I like about every one of them. I will check into Kirk's previous releases just to see what I've been missing. This definitely will not be my last or my only Gospel treasure."
5,Kirk Franklin has done it again,When I heard Hosanna I loved that song so much I would sing it every day. I bought this CD and listen I soon as I got home. Kirk Franklin did not disappoint me. One of the songs w/ Shirley Caesar is a great song. Me n my parents be listenin' to this every time we travel out of town. Get this CD and u will love this CD for years to come.
5,The Prince of Gospel,"Kirk Franklin has done it once again. God has truly gifted him with writing powerful,impactful, and inspriational music. This album has the best praise and worship numbers on it. The opening song on the cd "" Hosanna"" and the heart stirring "" My life,my love, my all"" will take you right into the thrown room of God. This album and every Kirk Franklin album is most definitely a must to have in your cd collection. You will be blessed just by listening to the album."
5,SIMPLY THE BEST!,"I must agree with many of the reviews. This album is by far one of Kirk Franklin's best! Some years ago I bought Kirk Franklin's first album and really enjoyed it. But after the first album, I no longer was a fan because Kirk seemed to become a bit too mainstream for me, i.e., the songs seemed too secular with too much crossover appeal. This latest album, however, has made me a fan all over again. Every song on the album is anointed. Trust me, if you enjoyed Kirk's first album, you will enjoy ""The Rebirth"" even more...I definitely have. I play it over and over and never get tired of it. The songs are original and fresh. You won't regret this purchase!"
5,Wonderful!,"This CD is wonderful! There is not a song that I didn't like. I had to hit repeat after each song to listen twice. I especially liked ""The Blood Song"" and ""Hosanna""."
3,"Some great tunes, but too much talk","I don't buy CD's for spoken word. And yet this one is replete with it, and a lot of interludes instead of the songs that are his strength.If he wants to preach--that's fine, but I didn't pay my money for that.Some terrific songs on here, but also some that aren't nearly as well-crafted, so that's why I think this collection is a mixed bag."
5,a shame that (you) kirk (are/)is relatively so unpopular -,e specially most normal/ignorant white people don't even know you ...hosanna - oh my godno doubt of you're existence anymore
2,Finally got all the lawsuits behind him-maybe,Seems like Kirk was jippin everybody out of some money or proper credit for singing or writing songs-so of course litigation was abound. Perhaps that's behind him now. If all of those things were true how can this man be a true man of God and not just another money motivated performer. I'm not saying that he is I'm just not as sure as I used to be. My younger brother approached him backstage at a concert in Kansas City about some gospel material he had written and Kirk shrugged him off very un-christian like. Needless to say my brother is no longer a fan.I'm sorry I just can't buy into these singers singing the lord's praises unless they are a true christian themselves and I just don't see it or hear it in Kirk Franklin.
5,One of the best gospel cds.,"if you like gospel music, this is definitely a must have. make sure you own this because it will stay in heavy rotation around your house and car."
5,Awesome,"I'm always late to the party, and I just got this CD, but I have always loved ""Brighter Day,"" and bought the album because of that, but have been so pleased with all the other songs on it too. ""Hossanah"" and ""He Reigns"" are gorgeous as well. Kirk is the bomb, plain and simple."
5,Wonderfully inspiring,"This CD has done what I believe music is supposed to do, and that is inspire and heal. I grew up listening to gospel music, and no other gospel album has ministered to me the way this one has. Every track, even the hidden bonus track with TobyMac of DCTalk, has the freshness of the anointing on it. I applaud Kirk for his stand and his faith in God. This is one listener who was truly blessed."
4,He's Baaack!!,"Wow! The man has done it again. From the first track, through the interludes, to the last track you will be inspired. Bought this CD yesterday and it is off the hook. As an aspiring songwriter and producer, I have a very good ear for music. Recording a live performance is not an easy task. When you listen to this CD, you won't be able tell it's live until you hear the audience applauding. He definitely went back to the drawing board on this one. In past projects, his up-tempo tracks used backing samples like on his song ""Stomp."" This time around, his infectious grooves are sample free. You gotta check out the live horns and strings that he uses. There is only one word to describe them. Remarkable.Give yourself a blessing and pick up the CD. Kirk definitely put his foot in this one.Peace...JT4"
5,"GREAT soulful, joyful, and rockin' Christian music!","Kirk Franklin brings so much soul and energy to his music! It is a rare treat in modern music to be moved by music, but the heartfelt honesty and universal message of Kirk Franklin's music is a joy to experience. You don't have to be Christian or a Kirk Franklin fan, to agree that this is great music, delivered by a great performer. This album has both live and studio tracks. A great album that you can dance to, or just reflect upon the message of love that our Lord has for every heart."
3,cute,"Smith's Collected Nonsense is a cute book, and I'm sure children love it, as well as those of us adults who like light and nonsensical verse. It's well worth the money and the time. But Smith isn't one of the heavyweights like Shel Silverstein or Dr. Seuss, or X.J. Kennedy, or even a Nancy Willard. There were many pieces that weren't funny or that Smith missed the punchline or the poem just fizzled out. And a few are there to show how clever Smith is. Still many of the pieces were enjoyable as were most of the illustrations. I say if you are buying for a child, pick it up. If you are buying for an adult, go with one of those listed above."
4,There are better books out there,"Constantine Balanis's book with the same title is much much better.Antenna Theory: Analysis and Design, 3rd Edition"
5,Children of the promise Vol 1-3,Awsome! True life in a great story form. You have got to read them all! I couldnt put them down. I can't believe what I have learned about our not so long ago past. This has helped me understand so much about our many war vetrans. I have much more appreciation for what the vetrans have done for us. This is truly a must read!
5,Enjoying this book again,We listened to this series on tape years ago while taking road trips. Now my 12-year-old daughter who loves to read series books is reading this series and really enjoys it.
1,LDS Genre needs a real writer.,"Dean Hughes is an OK writer - not a person with literary talent. I find this to be typical of the LDS genre. Just as in the Work and The Glory series by Gerald Lund I found this to be shallow, simple, and full of stereotypes. Where are the original characters - ones that we cheer for, or hate, or even cry for? They are non-existent in LDS literature, and the same can be said for this book.These authors of LDS fiction obviously know their market and their work will be sold because of the Deseret Book faithful. If they were to try and branch out more of thier work, it would not be picked up by a main stream publisher. We can only hope one day that a great author will start to write some truly great LDS fiction."
2,Ambrose did a better job in Band of Brothers,"I am going to buck the system and not give any of the ""Children of the Promise"" books more than 2 stars.I had just finished reading, and watching, Stephen A. Ambrose's ""Band of Brothers"" when I picked up the Children of the Promise series and started reading it. I didn't care for it, but I kept reading it. I found the novels had a lot in common with Band of Brothers.Latter Day Saints (and I am one of them) seem to have a real issue with originality. Unfortunately we seem to have a hard time finding our nitch and what we should be producing artistically. ""Children of the Promise"" doesn't flip the bill.Much of the conflict in the stories seems forced, most of the characters in the story aren't characters most of us would care about, and the family patriarch needs a perscription of Zoloft.Just because Dean Hughes is LDS, it doesn't mean the rest of us LDS folks need to automatically assign him 5 stars for a work that is not to original."
5,A Magnificent Find!!!,"...I decided to buy the first two of the series in case I did like it. I was amazed. This book completely surpassed all my expectations. It is about war, love, history, the church, it has a little bit of everything and the way it is written is so eloquent. I recomend this book to anyone who loves to actually get into a good book because once you start you will be wishing you bought the rest of the series all at once."
5,Quarterly Book Review Cass. 5,"Dean Hughes' ""Children of The Promise, Vol. I"" is an amazing story. It catches the reader's attention from the first page. The characters each have their own way of getting into the reader's imagination. From their reactions to the fast approaching World War, to the broken hearts and struggles of keeping a family together - this books takes the reader through a typical Mormon family's life. It tells of the characters endless struggle to find themsleves, as well as keeping their family together. With the outbreak of Wrold War II, the family must try to keep their beliefs as part of their everyday life, and turn to the Lord to guide them. I loved every minute, for it created questions and answers that apply to my life. It brings out the person inside of you that you really want to be by applying your own life to the story. A great way to find yourself, and a great story that I highly recommend it to those in want of a love, family and real life story."
1,this game sucks,"hi. i got this game frome bestbuy and it was a waist of my time and money. sometimes it freezes. you only get crapy cards. the cards cost 999,999 chips (on the game). this game is a piece of $@!&. dont buy it."
4,Why? Why do I have to give it stars? Why not star chips?,"Overall, this is a pretty good game. If I could have given it a 4.5 or somewhere around there, I would. The only thing wrong with this game(and maybe I just have Attention Deficet Disorder...)is that it gets so tedious dueling people over and over and over and...sorry. I can't say I love the storyline, that would just be sick (however, I do love Yugi), but I do LIKE it alot. This is a good game if you don't mind kind of lame jokes and a few boring characters here and there. And I can tell you not to depend on card codes from Gamefacts.com-- some don't work. Just stop listening to me rambling on and on and on and...sorry.Hope you don't hunt me down for this,warriorgrl42"
5,This Game Is Off The Chizainz,"WELL I DON'T REALLY KNOW HOW THIS GAME REALLY IS BUT HEARING HOW THEY EXPLAIN IT SEAMS REALLY PHAT I'M GONNA GET THIS GAME FOR CHRISTMAS AND I'M GONNA LOVE THIS GAME I ALREADY HAVE SOME CHEATS FOR IT BUT I'LL WAIT UNTILL I ALREADY BEAT THE GAME OR HAVING A HARD TIME AND CANT GET BY SO I'LL USE THE CODES.

3,My opinion about this game,"I'm a big fan of Yu-Gi-Oh! tv show and i think Yu-Gi-Oh! Forbidden Memories is really fun it got great graphic especiallywhen we see the 3D monster battle it soo cool, i love to duel all the caracter in the game, but i think it to bad we cannot duel Yugi moto or Yami Yugi because they have some pretty good card in the show, and i don't know why but i would love to know why we can battle marik, i can duel her sister Isis but why he's not in the game? and why does all the character's name are all wrong like for example: Tea/Teana, Joey/Jono, i hate the music in the game it so boring. The thing i really hate in this game is that you can only put one card on the field per turn, in the show they can put monsters in the field and magic cards, if you to think that you gonna like this play even with those disadvantage which it has, then Buy it!"
3,I think i will try it,"I have been playing Yu-Gi-Oh the rea; card game ever since it came out and i have never,NEVER lost a duel to anyone.Half the time all my friends are busy and so they kant play against me and it aint very fun playing against yoself.So i wuz thinking about getting either Yu-Gi-Oh Dark Duel Stories and just play it on my GBA or getting Yu-Gi-Oh Forbidden Memories.I kant decide so if anyone that reas this is ever online then IM me.My screenname is ....Thank you and it would b alot of help.And in case you are wondering y i gave this game a score it is cuz it wouldnt let me not give it one and i didnt want to give it a 1 and i didnt wanna give it a 5."
4,Only One Problem...,"First of all, i lov yugioh. I c it every saturday (sometimes the producers put repeats...) n i also collect the cards. In my opinion, this is a great game n anyone would get hooked on it after a while. The bad thing is that its really hard 2 get a really good card. Its almost impossible to get a card from a duelist that u want (belive me i tried lik 500 times) n if u try 2 buy it, u hav 2 pay 999,999 starchips! Now common! 999,999!That is 2 much! The max u get from 1 duel is 5! U'll hav 2 beat someone 200000 times (hav a calculator) n HOPE u get 5 ALL the time!THAT IS 2 MUCH!!!Cep't 4 that everything else is good. If u do buy it, dont expect 2 get great cards quick."
2,its ok,its ok but short and all you do is duel. its good at first but once you get used to it it gets easy. i bought it and its ok.
2,This game is so poor!,"Yu-Gi-Oh Forbidden Memories is so poorly made and is just no fun.I am only 9 years old and I love the Yu-Gi-Oh card game and I am so upset with the Playstation game.I have the Gameboy Color game and I thought that Forbidden Memories would be just as good but it is not.All kids who are excited about playing,don't.I was excited when I was going to rent it and play but once I started playing I had to shut it off just because this game is so bad.After that I even gave it a chance but it was just so bad.Don't even bother to rent Yu-Gi-Oh Forbidden Memories,it's one of the worst games ever."
1,Please Help Me I don't know wether to buy this game or not,Please tell me If you liked the game and if its good or if its bad
4,the best game ever,This a game for you yu-gi-oh fan!In the the game there are manyduelist.You get weak cards in the begining you will win good cards.(here's a hint make a combo of abyessflower and giffore when you get them.)You must buy this game.Goodluck!
5,''you know you can feel it'',"Ok,you guys know the feeling you get when yugi is in deep trouble in the t.v shows,this is the exact same thing.this game you have to fuse monsters to make them stronger,yuo will have to travel to the future and then come back.you will find people like joey in their ancient times.you will have to duel with other familliar dulers and the more you win the stronger and more cards you will get.(here is a review from the game)IN ANCIENT EGIPT THERE EXISTED A FORCE SO POWERFUL...IT HAD TO BE LOCKED AWAY FOR A MILLENIA......you will have to unravel the secrets of the ultimate power and the seven millenium items in your own risk.BE WARNED OF THE SECRTS OF A MISTERY PERSON YOU WILL MEET WITH SOMTHING UP HIS SLEAVE...............HA!HA!HA!HA!HA!HA!HA!.................."
3,Its OK,"Its fun at the begining,but as the game goes on it gets harder because your opponent's attack is in the high 2000s, and you only can have your attack in the 1000s...."
4,Yu-Gi-Oh - The best game out of Japan,"at first i thought this game was gay as hell and then my friend forced me into playing it and that game was more addictive than drugs i mean this game hooks you. I am supposed to be getting the game today and it is a great game. I give it 5 stars. This game lets battle the virtual world of duel monsters. You get all sorts of different mosters, some fuse together. There is different type of monsters too. Also there are trap cards, equip cards (to power up your monster), and magic cards that do all sorts of damage which can mean you sacricing all of your mosters on the field for his ( black hole ) or wiping ot his line of monsters with a Raigneki. my final words are Yu-Gi-Oh is the greatest game out of Japan."
3,Better than any other yu gi oh game.,"This is the yu gi oh game to buy. The storline is kinda hard to follow at first, but you catch on quickly. The way you get more cards in your chest is pretty cool, you have to defeat other opponents. If you have a yu gi oh card, you can put in the number, and if you have enough star chips, you can put in into your deck. I recommend getting this yu gi oh game rather than any other one."
3,Alright,"I thought that the game was alright. The graphics were really good for a playstation game and there were a variety of cards. The main problem was that I don't know how you are supposed to beat the game with such horrible cards. The most powerful card you can get in the begining is only like 1200. then you don't really win anything good in the duels. Other that that, the 2D pictures of the charactors and the fact that they don't talk aren't going to make this game any better. Finally, the game is pretty good. The campaign mode is really short and is impossible to beat without gameshark. Overall I give this game 3 stars."
1,review from a dissapointed teenager.,"One incredibly boring game, after playing for twenty minutes I decided to return it. The graphics are horrible, the story is ridiculous, the gameplay is just painful. Steer away from this game at all costs."
1,yu-gi-oh vidoe game are fun but not this one,"I am major Yu-gi-oh! fan i play a lot of yu-gi-oh video game some are fun but some are not When i first got this game i think this was going to be fun game but it was not like when i have a BEWD 3000 atk a monster whit 400 atk best it and when you buy card on this game a lot of the card are too munch it like 999,999 chips (on the game)"
4,ok,this game insn't the greatest.you have to buy monsters when you put in the code.I suggest you get the gameboy advanced game instead.but if you want a game that your bored of the next day go ahead.
3,Nice game,"This is a pretty nice game. However I think it could be better. Its just like the show,you fight other people with ur Cards...its a pretty fun game."
4,COOL GAME!,This is a great game and if you really like yugioh then i sugguest that you buy this game and the blue eyes white dragon is so cool in 3d. And if you are looking for a long and challenging game then this is the perfect choice for you.
5,"YU-GI-OH, THE GOOD AND THE 1 BAD THING","THIS GAME IS EVERY YU-GI-OH! FAN'S DREAM. U START AS A PRINCE IN EYGPT.A DARK FORCE COMING AND YOU JUST WANT TO PLAY THE GAME. IF YOU DON'T WANT TO SPOIL ANYTHING DON'T READ THE ().( YOU ARE THE PERSON IN YU-GI'S PUZZEL.) THEN YOU ARE YU-GI IN THE MIDDEL. THAT IS WHERE I AM . YOU WAKE UP AS YU-GI BY JOEY FOR A COMP. SO FAR I HAVE FACED WEEVEIL , REX , MEI , AND BANIT KEITH. I HAVE SOME GOOD CARDS. IT WILL TAKE YOU A LONG TIME TO GET GOOD CARDS. SAVE EVERY CHANCE YOU GET CAUSE THIER IS NOT A SAVE OPTION ALL THE TIME , BUT OVER ALL THIS GAME ROCKS BIG TIME!!!! I WILL WRITE ABOUT THIS LATER. PEACE!!!!"
2,This game is okay,"1. I have seen better graphics on the SNES, Atori, Genesis, and Oblongs systems (from back in the 70s)2. This game has good (GREAT) gaming system3. The loading time is greatNUMBER RATINGSGraphics- 2/10Play system- 8/10Loading- 7/10"
4,Play Yu-Gi-Oh on PSX or PS2,"This game is mainly a card game, not an RPG. You can choose who to play against first, but only sometimes. Fans of the TV show or actual card game will like it. The rules are slightly simplifyed, but they are closer to the actual rules than those of the TV show. Buy this game if you like Yu-Gi-Oh, Magic the Gathering, or stuff like that."
3,It's kinda cool,"When the TV show came out I became a Yugioh fan. I buy cards of the game and go to tournaments and I even beat the duelist leader for rare cards. This game is cool when Yugi wakes up and went to Kaiba's tournament, but the battlefield is the same thing. Duels are fun when you up against a hard opponent. This game is hard to beat with any thinking before you make your move. This show is been on air for like 2 years now. And I'm still a fan of it. I know a lot of people play this game in school. When Beyblade came out a lot people play that instead of Yugioh, they lost a lot of fans then."
2,Yu-gi-oh PS2 game,I bought this game for [money] when I got home and put it in my PS2 I noticed that the people do not move they only move their lips and eyes. When you do the 3d battle sequence they look 2d. It is fun to play the game but the graphics stink. If you want to get it get it but it's a rip off.
3,ok,this gome is OK. You can either duel back before you were in the millenium item or at the begining you can keep listening to this guy and eventually be in modern time. you have know way of knowing which monsters you are allowed to fuse. This game isn't as fun as real dueeling though :(
3,Think before purchasing,"Ok, I'll tell you the truth. This game isn't all bad. But it could definatly be better. I noticed in the game you can't actually walk, the story carries you. you.Another thing I was dissapointed about was how many starchips you must pay to obtain Blue Eyes White Dragon, 99,999 starchips! The most you can get in one duel is 5. Even Gaia the Fierce Knight. The storyline can also get boring. I think if your a hardcore Yu-Gi-Oh fan you should buy this, if not forget about it."
5,yugioh is the best,this is a good games for kids it teaches kids to be strategic. im a 12yr old boy i got yugioh forbidden memories for my 13th birthday and it is the best playstation game that has ever come out for the forgotten psone. I let my little cousin play he wouldnt stop playing i had to actually hide the playstation from him hehe i also play the card game it is really so parents give yugioh a chance.
2,Truly A Dissapointing Game,"When I first played Yu-Gi-Oh!: Forbidden Memories it seemed like a pretty good game. Soon after it started getting boring and the dueling was really horrible. The game could have been much better. It's graphics were horrible to Duelists Of The Roses, and this game got very dull soon. The dueling isn't that fun, and it is so rare to come by magic or trap cards. The starchip thing where you have to get a certain number of them to put in a password of cards are really, really annoying. The best cards like the Red Eyes Black Dragon is for 99999 starchips. Unless you like normal dueling pick this game, otherwise I would stick to Duelists Of The Roses. It might not exactly be dueling, but the graphics and games are a bit more exciting then Forbidden Memories."
2,Yu-Gi-Oh Forbidden Memories,I did not like the game at all because it wouldent let me attack even when I had a curse of dragon against a basic insect and I ended up losing when it fused with another very strong monster.I am a big fan of yu-gi-oh but if the instructions told me how to attack I might of just won the battle.I was so frustrated with the game I told my mum to take it straght back to where she got it from.I am not a complainer its just I was not satisfied with the game...
3,needs work but good,This game needs a lot of work. It had no effect cards like time rollet on the time wizard like in the acttule game. Ritual cards could have been more spacefic on what cards you need to complete the ritule. It had a limited variety of magic and trap cards which made the battles basicaly who ever had the strongest deck. and next time at least make fussions easyer to figure out though not too easy. last I wish the game would have used better way of showing the feild one which the dule was going on.
3,good,"This product was offered in the amazon site when we saw it, it was discount so it was clearly a great chance to obtain it."
4,Excellent Resource Book,"This is an excellent resource for anyone working with youth and young adults, especially those in the non-profit field. The book provides ideas, helpful hints, and most importantly empowers youth to help their community.All of the ideas are well thought out. Many of the activities can be altered, simplified, or enhanced depending on your goals.There are very helpful hints on how to create press releases, flyers, public service announcements, etc. This is a helpful guide for youth and a great resource for adults.I recommend this book to anyone who works with youth and young adults that are committed to helping others."
4,An oasis for a spouse of a survivor,"After almost two years on this journey with my wife I was frustrated trying to find any books to help me understand what was going on. Our therapist, though helpful, did not have a reading list for me. I went on a search for help and found this book. As a follower of Christ, I found the authors' perspectives very helpful. The format of the book that includes the personal story of the spouse of a survivor followed by instruction from the therapists is most helpful. Even though the book is more than fifteen years old, and out of print, it should be must reading for a Christian spouse struggling to understand and cope with the impact of the survivor's struggle with past abuse."
3,we want complete Lydia performances,This was a tease of what's out there I watched it but was frustrated just small collages of footage. There is one great complete performance dvd Willing Victim.Lydia I tell you if she wasn't concidered a artist she'd be put away lol. I love her and scared of her and when she was younger/thinner my oh my
4,Excellent History Book,"This is the most detailed and longest history book I have ever read. Although it is a tad too long for high school students, it covers a lot of infomation for the AP History test. For you AP History teachers, I would recommend that you should teach from this book. It helps prepare the students for their AP test."
4,history,"didn't come with web option as advertisedpackage damaged & ""postage due""no return address on boxbut book good"
5,Great Quality Multiplex CD with Guide vocal tracks as well as instrumental.,Item Number: PHMR - 030201-Down-Socialburn-1002-Tomorrow-SR-71-1103-Not Falling-Mudvayne-1204-Same Old Song-Sev-1305-Running From Me-Trustcompany-1406-Innerversion-System Of A Down-1507-Still Waiting-Sum 41-1608-The Red-Chevelle-1709-Clocks-Coldplay-18
5,"Great book for Boys, Girls, & Adults","This is a great book! Long out of print, the used version I received was in good shape, just as described.The contents of the book are superb. Basic principles of electric motors, steam engines & turbines, waterwheels, etc. are explained simply yet accurately. It gives just the right amount of detail for projects to build working models - with a little skill and effort. I'd recommend this for anybody who has kids - it will teach them a lot. I would like to see it reprinted - just as is, with all the attitude of the '40's intact."
3,"Full of important content, but somewhat disorganized","I spent time in Ecuador and the Cuyabeno Reserve this pastsummer. The oil industry was evident. I did not, however,notice the prevalent odor associated with oil in US oil fields,but multiple pipelines were evident at the Cuyabeno bridge whichis the entrance to the Cuyabeno Reserve.So, I was interested in this oil controversy. Thereis lots of good content and background on the controversy, butit is a bit disorganized from USA standards. Don't expect a fairand balanced treatment. The Ecuadorian government's role in thisdebacle is not well detailed. Scientific proof is not well addressedin this documentary, but it is very good on the narratives of the people."
5,A fascinating look at the alien question,"This was a unique and creative film that was full of surprising insight and funny anecdotes. It not only was well done, but had an underlying message with layers of meaning as a reflection of our present world, while raising what may be possible in the near future. I highly recommend this!"
4,Just what I was looking for,"I'm leading a long-term study of Pilgrim's Progress and was seeking a supplemental source of discussion materials that were specific to the allegory, not just over-all questions on the entirety of the piece. Bradley's book offers a nice selection of questions that provoke thought or discussion. It's a thin volume, but it's meaty. My only criticism of it is one aimed at the book designer: the print seems to be a gray ink on a white paper. It's an artsy thing, but it makes the book harder to read than it needs to be. There is a reason that the standard is black on white."
3,I supposed it's OK,personally I got more out of the book (Pilgrim's Progress) by simply sitting quietly with my own reflections. But I've been trained in reflection so if one has not been then one my choose to use a guide. This one will work.
3,"nice plaing, but","this was highly recommended by gramophone but it lacks the energy of the brendel recording. listen, especially to the final impromptu in F minor. brendel blows her away."
3,not for me,"I didn't care for this novel. I thought that the book had too much needless, useless information. I didn't care for the long winded descriptions and explanations, they didn't lend anything to the story. I also thought that the characters seemed one dimensional. All of the characters seemed like little molded toys and not real people. On the positive side, I got to look at a small midwestern town during this time period."
2,So small towns really are unprogressive?,"Ok, so small rural towns are unprogressive and full of gossiping narrow minded simpletons. So what else is new? I assume that if you're interested in reading about these boring people Main Street is good. I can only guess that when the book was written, small towns were considered a glamorous place to be and the book exposed otherwise - making the author a hated person by rural WASP's all over America."
3,Accurate; in fact a little too accurate.,"Sinclair Lewis pains a picture of small town life. Carol, the main character, leaves the city with her new husband to experience small-town life in the small town of Gopher Prarie. As she settles into the town, she discovers its residents are conservative, resistant to change or new culture, wary of outsiders and those who are different, and blind to their own hypocricies. The plot basically follows her struggle against the small-town way of thinking and living.Those who enjoy an exciting storyline might want to search elsewhere. The book, somewhat intentionally, has a slow pace and few exciting adventures. Furthermore, Lewis is perhaps a little one-sided in showing the negatives of small-town life without showing many advantages. Still, the book teaches a valuable lesson about the dangers of too much routine and consistency."
2,Main Street,"Main Street is a satirical novel in every sense of the word. Lewis attacks the narrow-minded, intolerant and rude citizens of Gopher Prairie, Minnesota, and compares them to every other small town in America. 90% of the book discusses this topic while the other 10% speaks of the methods the main character uses to try and change the town into something it is not. Though there is a touching point at the end of the book where he praises the simplicity of small town life, by then you are so depressed by the dull town, the gossiping townspeople, and the straying main character that it loses its meaning."
5,WOW!,If you ever study to bible this is a must have. Came quickly and looks perfect. WHen they say exaustive their not kidding.
4,solid game--lots of fun,I wanted a baseball game that was a good mix of arcade action as well as true to life gameplay. Baseball Advance is exactly that. Very easy to pick up and get into but also realistic. If you want a solid baseball game that has good graphics and action then pick this one up.
4,fun game,"If you like baseball, then I would recommend this new game. The graphics are solid and so is the play control. A word to the wise--hitting will take some practice, but it adds to the challenge. There are only 4 ballparks to play in, however this is a trade-off for the top notch graphics the game sports. There is a season mode as well as an all-star game. For 30 bucks you can't go wrong. SEga should stick to making sports games and stop making systems."
3,It's O.K...,"I got this for a minimul amout at the convention and wouldn't have given them any more money than that. Now don't get me wrong I did like it, it just didn't keep me wanting more after the first volume so I won't get any more."
1,sucks,"I read those review online and buy all three books of Tomie. That was a big mistake. Tomie is so boring, and so is her stories. All the guys in the stories love her because of her beauty, and then for no reason, cut her into pieces. It sounds interesting, huh, but the truth is that all of the stories of Tomie just rotates in the same circle, nothing's new. Believe me, don't buy this book!!!!!"
2,"Skip it, unless you love speed","I'm glad I've never seen these guys in a live performance because I would have been the heckler who got up and yelled, ""Hey, boys, what's the hurry? Got a plane to catch?"" Mind you, they play all the notes and stuff, it's the tempi that drove me up the wall. This music is difficult enough as it is without having it fly by you at breakneck speed. The Emersons are obviously in love with their own virtuosity -- isn't that special -- but the point of performance is to let the music speak for itself. Nuff said. 2 stars is generous. P.S. I can't stand the Toscanini, Gardner crowd either, but you probably guessed that."
3,Overall good book but,"the ending left me unsatisfied. It's one thing to say this & that happened. But it's another to CONVINCE me of it. Maybe it's because I was never fully convinced that Nicky could love Tory (I wanted him to feel that earth shattering love). I thought this was more one sided; on Tory's part. Even at the end, he was attending a ball with another woman! I prefer a hero who CONVINCINGLY changes his ways. Why couldn't he fall in love with her first? She was doing all the heart wrenching stuff. Near the end, she hung around for months waiting for him (not that he made any promises to her or gave her ANY indication of a future or even a future meeting! ) and he didn't even acknowledge her during that time! It's hard to admire a woman who doesn't think she deserves better than that. Don't get me wrong, a few words here and there at the last few chapters and I would have given it 4 or 5 stars."
3,This book was O.K. but I wanted it to end...,I had very high hopes for this book after seeing the reviews but I had to force myself to finish the book. I felt that almost every sexual encounter in this book could be considered rape & I don't have a problem reading that in a book but I just don't understand how this girl could come to love this man after the way he treated her. I also don't see how Nick could just stand by when other men were about to rape his woman & I don't understand why Tory would do the seduction act that she did towards end when she truly didn't know that both men would go for her at once. Who's to say that her trick would truly work? What would've happened had one man been put to stand guard while the other raped her? I know a lot of women were helpless in those days but I think I would've fought to my death rather then endure some of the stuff that Tory had to endure. I just don't think this book was thought out that well therefore I can't recommend this book.
2,Not on par with other Rogers novels,"I was very disappointed with this novel. I've read & enjoyed many Rosemary Rogers novels before, but this one was boring from the first few pages. I had to force myself to finish it. The plot was basically a re-tread of scenes from her prior novels, and none of the characters were particularly likeable or involving. Nothing new or fresh here."
5,ADDICTEDTO GOOD BOOKS,ROSEMARY ROGERS HAS ALWAYS BEEN A FAVORITE AUTHOR OF MINE.I HAVE READ AND THEN REREAD ALL OF HER BOOKS. I AM ALSOA COLLECTOR AND KEEP HER BOOKS IN MY LIBRARY. SOMETIMESI WILL SHARE WITH FRIENDS BUT I ALWAYS WANT THE BOOKSRETURNED SO THAT I MAY REREAD THEM AFTER A TIME.LOVE THIS AUTHOR.
4,Pretty good boOk,"I had read a few of Rogers' books, and i especially took an interest to ""Sweet Savage Love."" The characters were so likeable and the story was captivating. I found ""A Dangerous Man"" to be very similiar... perhaps too similar. The characters resembled each other, especially the leading men. Rogers repeated the gypsy dancing theme (it was a little annoying) and she threw in her infamous rape scenes. However, I found ""A Dangerous Man"" and the characters and their love for each other to be a bit mroe believeable and their final unite was not as annoying to get to as ""Sweet Savage Love"". The ending of ""A Dangerous Man"" did lack a little more passion than I was hoping for. But overall, it was a good book. The beginning is a little boring, but keep reading. It does get much better."
1,Just awful,I'm afraid I have to side with those who were disappointed by this book. It promises so much but just doesn't deliver....and Idle just relies on so many coincidences to tie his story together. I actually got really angry reading this. Not a pleasant experience at all.
1,Sick and stupid,"This book isn't funny. Although I do like the story, Idle tries using words like ""vibrator"" and ""testicle"" to spark laughter. Instead, he just makes me sick. Idle just thinks that if he uses enough vulgarity, he will make us laugh. I don't know about anyone else, but it didn't make me laugh. Of course, if he left the unnecessary sex out, it would only be about twenty pages long."
1,Stinker,"Problem is, if you put a bit of a twist at the end of your book, you have to make sure that your story still holds up. No good having a surprise ending which makes all that came before just look like landfill, or bookfill, which this is. Buy something else."
3,A decent read,"I'm a huge Python fan so I thought I'd give the book a shot. To his credit, Eric Idle does write a decent book. I think that it's got some really awkward phrasing and an awkward plot line that detract from the overall fun. The funny moments are definitely funny but it takes some patience to get there with this book. I'm sure that it helps that I'm a Python fan because I'm not sure that all readers would have stuck with it."
1,Read the following instructions,"Buy this book. Go out into your garden. Dig a hole. Place the book in the hole. Bury it. If you do it quickly you will get up a sweat and feel satisfied that at least you got some exercise, which is an entirely more fulfilling experience than reading this garbage. Compost is all it's good for."
1,Here's a constructive suggestion,"Go and buy Ben Elton's 'Inconceivable' instead. I don't think Amazon's got it yet, but the story is much stronger, and the ending doesn't suck.If you like your funny books to actually be funny, then wait for Inconceivable."
1,Oh dear,I think Mark Hulber should have read the book before giving it 5 stars. It promises so much but never delivers.
1,Not funny,"Not funny...at least not before page 45, which is where I stopped reading. Dry as dirt. The book is in part about an android's graduate thesis on comedy. Unfortunately, it reads like an android's graduate thesis on comedy.I returned the book to Amazon...the first book I've ever returned anywhere.Want to read something funny? Check out Bob Zmuda's biography of Andy Kaufman. You won't be laughing at every page, but even at its slow points, it's 10x more interesting than ""Road to Mars""."
5,The Meaning of the End,"If you are having trouble with the end of the book, you may have never quite understood Python's bizzar sense of reality."
2,Douglas Adams is still safe,"I also had high hopes for this book. Idle obviously has a sense of humor that comes along once in a lifetime. However, his talent for sketches and feature movies with his Python-mates didn't save this book. I really wanted to like this book, but it was a struggle to get through the damn thing. It reminded me of After The Blue, by Russel Like, which also promised to be the next ""Hitch Hikers Guide."" It didn't deliver, and neither does ""Road to Mars"" (it didn't even come as close as Starship Titanic, by another ex-Python, Terry Jones).There was talent there, and some sense of the wit that if wrapped around a more promising story line and with less adolescent sexual fantasy, would have made for a great book. Unfortunately, the story was lame, the distractions too frequent and the inspiration too sporadic. A disappointment. If Adams decides to start writing in this genre again, he'll still be without effective competition, even after taking over 10 years off."
1,Depressingly disappointing,"I love a good 'light read' as another reviewer puts it. I love Monty Python. I love authors like Douglas Adams and Terry Pratchett. I'm willing to overlook the odd shortcoming or flaw in a book for the sake of a good story, and Road to Mars begins as a good story. The meaning of comedy theory is a little irriating, and disrupts the narrative flow, but one can always skip irritations. But no matter how good your story if you don't end it right then your lost, and the ending in Road to Mars is simply ludicrous. It just brings too many ridiculous coincidences into play. If you like big-budget Hollywood action films then you'll love Road to Mars. There are just as many gaping holes in the story."
2,"Alas poor Eric, I thought I knew him....","Initially, I was thrilled to find Mr. Idle had penned a novel. But then I began to read it. Through the entire novel, I prayed it would get better. While it was readable, the plot was disappointingly average and the jokes were few and far from his best Monty Python efforts. Perhaps, my expectations were too high as the novel came from such a comedic genius. As a result, it pains me to be unable to recommend the book to friends, many of whom know the words to every Python bit verbatim."
3,Not as bad as people say...,"Ok, so people don't like the book. It wasn't genius, but it was clever and entertaining, a quick read, occasionally bogged down by self-indulgence (but hey! Look at Stephen King if you want an example of a self-indulgent, rambling style!). At least Idle managed to reel it in when he went off a little too long on his comedy thing. No, he's not Douglas Adams, but who can be? Adams is rife with Absurdism and philosophical irony. If you're careful enough, you may detect subtleties in Idle's style, too.Overall, I just want to say: get over it. And, if you've read Idle's book, you know what you can do if you can't take a joke."
1,mmmmm,"Personal reviews can often be meaningless without some idea of the personal tastes of the reviewer. I love writers like Douglas Adams and Terry Pratchett. I love off-the-wall, bizarre humour. I think Monty Python is terrific. My favourite movies are made by the Coen brothers, experts in weird humour. I thought Road to Mars was an entertaining read....until I hit the appalling ending. Urghhh! Talk about writing in a twist just for the sake of writing in a twist! Road to Mars is easily the worst book I've read all year. Really, Eric. I expected so much more."
3,Amusing...except I just don't get one thing...,"I enjoyed a robot's theory of comedy...even though I didn't agree with all of it. My criticism of Idle's book has to with the misogyny of the narrator, the historian. So, his girlfriend/wife left him...What does that have to do with anything in the rest of the book!"
3,"Hey, C'mon, Lighten Up","I'd ask all my fellow critics to think a little about ""Monty Python."" First, it was silly, by and large, wasn't it? Oh, once in a while you'd get a whiff of profundity, but it was really just off-the-wall silliness most of the time. Well, that's what this book is - no ground-breaking tome about The Necessity of Comedy or Humans Adapting to Space, just a pleasant diversion for a quick read. I will grant you that this is no perceptive Douglas Adams futurism - Mr. Idle doesn't kill himself trying to excise the anachronisms - and I will grant you that this is one of the slowest starting books I've read in a long time. But to trash it wholesale, well, that's just going overboard. Save your pans for books that truly deserve them (""Bridges of Madison County"" or ""Celestine Prophecy"" for instance). There's a lot to like in ""The Road to Mars"" actually. Why, the delineation of the ""houseboat"" that the heroes live in while en route to their gigs is worth a star all by itself."
4,I'm sorry to express my non-conformist opinion........,"But I thought it was a good book. Being a truly fanatical Monty Python fan, I picked it up expecting spectacular results. Admittedly, those were not what I got, but I thought it was a good book. It's quite funny, and the incredible number of Monty Python related stuff that slips in is great fun, like when Carlton can't understand with the Flying Circus is all about, and John Cleese's name appearing twice, and Eric Idle making fun of himself. Bits of quotes appear as well. The characters are not exceptionally developed, that's true, and the Bill Reynolds narrator person is a bit odd, but it's just a fun book. It's not like reading ""Crime and Punishment"", people, it's just a nice book to sit down and read when you're bored or slightly hyperactive - so calm down it if wasn't a literary masterpiece. It dosn't have to be to be good."
4,Good ball for price,so i just bought this ball because i bought a net and first reaction is that it looks really good. after testing a bit noticed it wasnt too hard or soft. i will update after playing around with it more
3,Wilson AVP Replica Game Ball,"The Wilson AVP Replica Game Ball is fine for knock-around use. If you're serious about your sand game, you'll want to shell out for the Official ball, but the Replica is a good ball for an inexpensive price."
3,Hence Replica,"Made in China. Not top quality, stiching is lopsided, it has an okay feel, and is fine for practice."
1,dirty ball?,"The ball came within the time frame indicated at sale, but looked old/worn/dirty when I got it. I don't want to go through the hassle of sending it back though, but I hope the one I sent my friend for her birthday looked new!"
4,Yeah!,"Love the way that these pads make the paint shine!! Would never buy another brand, and i would hate to spend the full $30 per pad at the stores!"
3,Finally a realistic view of a young adult drawf.,"This book shows young adult drawfs as they are in real life: some slow, some clever, some honest, some con men. Humorous at times, but always down to earth. I enjoyed reading something about drawfs other than a medical report."
3,"The book came in good shape, and promptly....","...but I wasn't crazy about the book itself, for all its supposed greatness. I thought it a little too edgy for a book written for its intended audience, with its strange characters and plot, however creative. (I'm pretty conservative-minded when it comes to books for young people.)"
1,I wish I had not bought this book,"This was apparently a self published title from ""Winners Press"" and a good ego boost for the author. I guess if I were a lottery winner, I would pay to get my name in print but maybe give the books away instead of taking advantage of people and charging for a book like this.Did not learn anything expect that they seem to be enjoying having won $13.5 million. If they get another $13.5, I wonder if they will use to refund money to those who purchased this book.Glad they were lucky enough to win the lottery and not have it ruin their lives terribly.Another reviewer titled the review ""disappointed."" Wish I had read that first as that was exactly how I felt."
3,DISAPPOINTED,"I WAS DISAPPOINTED WHEN I READ THISBOOK. I WAS EXPECTED SOMEHTING ALOT MORE EXCITING. LIFE IS EXCITINGAND WINNING THE LOTTERY MUST HAVEBEEN A VERY EXCITING EVENT. I THINKTOO MJUCH TIME WAS SPENT EXPLAININGTHE MATHEMATICAL FORMULA AND NOTENOUGH TIME ON WHAT FUN THEY MUSTHAVE ALREADY HAD SPENDING SOME OFTHE MONEY. I KNOW THAT MRS BALDWINIS PLANNING TO WRITE ANOTER BOOK, AND JUST MAYBE I WILL LIKE THAT BOOKBETTER. I DO AGREE WITH HER ON THE PRINCIPLEOF TITHING AND SHARING WHAT GOD HASSO GENEROUSLY GIVEN. I THINK SHE DID A VERY GOOD JOB CONVEYING HERFEELINGS ABOUT THAT. I AM LOOKINGFORWARD TO READING HER NEXT BOOKWHEN SHE FINISHES IT."
5,Love them Catfish,"Sit on a corner. clear your mind .and be ready to absorb some info on Catfish.How, when and where to get them.Heck these books are my private stash on Catfish.Caught my father whos is 78 years old looking at this book.One who hates to put his speckers (glasses) on.Lookin at pictures. Asked me to explain some techniques.heck I love it . Any time you spend with you DAD fishingand talking about techniques you read about.Wow"
3,catfishing,"I was looking for shore fishing info. I have the complete guide for catching big channels, blues and flatheads. Keith Suttonalso wrote this book, which has bigger pages and color photos in it. These two book are very similar."
1,outdated,"This book does not cover any of the paint or welding technology that has developed in the past 10 years, which is critical knowledge for today's auto restorer."
4,Monster Rancher,"I must say, I originally thought this series would be yet another Pokémon/Digimon clone. I was wrong. This series teaches the fundamentals friendship along with the obvious good versus evil. The best part about Monster Rancher is that is actually a 'closed' story line with a great conclusion. Not all of the episodes are available for purchase yet, but they are worth collecting."
1,"Really, really 0 stars for this anime.","This cartoon is the most bothering anime I had ever seen, is worser than Digimon, the hole cartoon really really bothers me, it's dumb, stupid and boring."
2,Brain Quest DVD,As a Mom of three kids I love Brain Quest! I am disapointed with the DVD game! I can not get the menue button to work on the game and will not let me navagate! The game also cuts out at the last few words from each question! However it does not bother my kids so I am going to keep it! They play this game over watching TV (Most of the time) My kids ask every day to do some kind of brain quest weather its with the cards or the DVD game! I do think they could have done a much better job over all at this game! With all the high tech stuff out there its very blah! So this is a review from an adult! My kids would say differnt! Over all brain quest needs to step it up and put out a new one!Mom of three on the Cold wet Coast
4,one of the better books ive read in the past 2 years,great book even though it diddnt go into as much detail as i would have liked.
4,Surprisingly Strong Finish,"The subject title refers to both this book itself and the series as a whole. The entire drama with Nicole grew and evolved to become one of the central foci of the book. For that awesome scene at the end - and the realization of the meaning of the Universe - it almost deserves a ""*****"". But Nicole's other self seems so human like in her wants and desires. We got to this point and the authors seem to be saying, ""OK, we know the secrets of the cosmos. What do we do now?""I would have loved to have seen this idea in the hands of a Frank Herbert or a Pamela Sargeant."
2,I understand!,"Not!OK. I did like the octospiders. Didn't buy the ""revelation"", still didn't buy humans so totally self destructive. Wonder what the Precursors looked like. God using technology? Kind of knocks God down to the human level that a deity needs technology - certainly a contradiction of the inherent qualities of God. (Now a god, maybe.)A little inconsistency on the octos- a mistake means you are no longer useful? (Hercules) Never answered the question on Nicole's unique genetic qualities.Having read the 2nd and third books in the series, I do think this was better than those, but absolutely none holds a candle to the first."
1,"Please God, let this be the end!!!","All I can say is that the final Rama book was worse than the other two sequals to ""Rendezvous..."". This extremely long dime-novel was not worth my time and money. I was already upset that A.C. Clarke would waste his energy and paper on the two previous novels in this series, but this book brings me to new levels of disappointment. If you are interested in slutty sex scenes and stupid action-adventure, and do not want to find any meaning in a book then read this one. For anyone who is not a horny twelve-year old, I suggest passing this one by."
2,One the most disappointing books ever.,"Better by far than the third book in the series, this non-conclusive conclusion still disappoints on many levels. Like many others I have learned to avoid the name Gentry Lee while brousing the bookshelves. My advice: read the first book, Rendezvous with Rama and avoid the rest. Your imagination is better equipped to write the rest of the story than Mr. Lee ever was"
2,"Clarke, how could you?","I was actually enjoying this series, despite the fact Nicole was ridiculously fault-free. The octospiders were quite interesting and I found the portrayal of humanity as violent and xenophobic to be spot on. The ending, however, was such a colossal cop-out. I felt totally cheated out of my money and my time."
3,Mediocre end to the series,As most will agree the first book in the series was suberb and each follow up by Lee went further downhill. I rather disliked Lee's fascination with religion throughout the books he wrote and especially how it tainted the ending of this particular one. I think it's kinda worth a read if you're struggling to find something since I did find the overall story to be very interesting but it could have been sooooo much better. Truly a shame.
1,Why does God need a starship?,"The final chapter in the ""RAMA Saga"" ends with a whimper, and not the beautiful kind that Yeats spoke of. Instead, it ends with revelations that lift ideas from Clarke's short stories.I suppose this isn't such a sin since Clarke himself lifted entire sections of some novels out of his short stories. For instance, Clarke reproduced his short story ""Meeting with Medusa"" almost verbatium as a chapter in 2010: Odyssey Two. So, I'll forgive it.However, the final revelation is not much more than another red herring, another rabbit hole with rabbit holes. It doesn't help that huge sections of the novel are simply characters standing around and being told the ""HISTORY AND MEANING OF EVERYTHING."" It lacks any wit or wonder."
2,Rama Revealed: Dissappointing,"This book was very poor. The science fiction elements were nearly non-existant, leaving a plot that was straight out of some cheezy .99 cent novel. The conclusion was pathetic, and ruined much of the Rama experience. My advice, if you've suffered through II & III, you might as well read this. Otherwise, don't."
1,Like being smothered in quicksand !,Why did Gentry Lee have to mess with a good thing. Nicoles flashbacks and pages of dribble........what a total SNOOZER !!Read the original RR and let you own mind figure the answers!
1,Is it possible to rewrite the last two books?,"Wow! What an absurd concept, that GOD, the creator of all, would need a starship! It left gaping holes and could have or rather should have gone in another direction altogether. No sinister plots, no real twists, just flat characters driven by their own selfish wants. The character pattern is so definitively established by the time they wrote this book that except for the history lessons you already know how it is going to end.In the end I kept reading in the hope that there would be something worthwhile to be garnered from the effort it took to read this atrocity. However I was thoroughly let down in the end."
1,Rama series terriible,I fully agree with the bad reviews of the Rama series. Rendezvous With Rama was interesting and it went down from there.Rama II ??? Barely worth readingGarden of Rama was boring. Rama Revealed was so poorly written and unimaginative I finally started skipping pages and thenskipped all the way to the end and sold them back to my book dealer.Predictable in a VERY BAD way. I would not recommend these to anybody!
4,"Clarke should write only series of three books, not four!","The book is rather good, althought it is quite a long series(4 books). The first ""Rendezvous with Rama"" is Excellent!. The second ""Rama II"" is really very good, the third ""The Gardens of Rama"" is quite boring, and the fourth is almost an obligation to read after you've reached this point, but Clarke amends what he's done in the third book. He (and almost all other SF writers) should write only THREE books each series. The first open questions, the second debates them and the third he can solve mysteries and dream. Same with the 2001, 2010 and 2061 series. The 3001 book is horrible. Read ""Childhood's End"", for me the best book Clarke ever wrote."
2,And the first book was so promising . . .,"After reading the first book (Rendevous with Rama) I was looking forward to finding out all the answers to the questions raised. What I discovered was that in some cases, it is better not to know. The three books where Arthur C. Clarke collaborated with Gentry Lee just got worse and worse as I went through them, but the concept of Rama is so good that I'll still give 2 stars to this book. The Rendevous was a classic science fiction novel, but the ending of this book is hardly science fiction at all. Please, I beg anyone out there, read the first book and keep it at that! It's much, much better that way . . ."
1,"Don't read Rama II and Rama III, or this.","The only reason I don't rate this lower than one is that the review javascipt won't let me.My advice, read ""Rendezvous with Rama"", then skip to the conversation between wossername and the alien in book four.(But don't buy it, read it in a library, it should only take a minute or two, and you might find something nice to read while you are in there. Like a good SF novel.)As an example of how not to write SF, ""Rama Revealed"" is just about average. As SF, it is pitiful."
1,Should have stopped at Rendezvous,"After reading other excellent works by Arthur Clarke, Rama Revealed is such a disappointment. Rendezvous with Rama was such an excellent book, and Rama II was not all bad either. Garden of Rama and this last one in the series can only be considered progressive deteriorations. Where Rendezvous was a page turner, I endured this book so I could get to the end. Too many pages spent on inane sub-plots and not enough on the overall story. After reading Rendezvous and then the rest, I came away with the feeling that only the first one bears Clarke's stamp."
2,Gentry lee ...,I love Mr Clarke's work. But when ever he works with someone it tends to dilute his briliance. In this case Mr Lee and his negativeness runs rampant on a otherwise marvelous story.
2,Whaaaaaaaaaat?,"OK at what point did the Octospiders tell Richard Wakefield that, ""Yes! Wow, we are so amazed that you guessed what we call ourselves. Octospiders! How in the hell did a human guess that from just looking at us?"" He made up the name for them in book two, and now it's gospel. What would happen if the Octos started off calling the humans, pink, whiny, four legs? So far this isn't resolved, maybe I skimmed over the part where the, ""Octospiders,"" told the humans that their real name for their species would be impossible for them to pronounce.I have cringed beyond belief every time a character is made to say, 'Whaaat?' the two extra, ""a's"" stand for: we have too many changes of scenery to cover so to hell with rich character descriptions."
1,Oh God!,"One of the worst possible endings to a series, ironically which began with one of the best sci-fi stories Ive ever read(Rendezvous with Rama). I really dont know why Clarke had to invoke god in order to explain the alien constructs - couldnt something like just a very advanced alien civilization or something do? And for that, you come across one of the weakest, most powerless gods youve ever read about anywhere! I mean this god thingy is creating multiple universes to conduct his experiments, and he cant even manage faster-than-light travel? The guy defines the very physical laws thatd govern the universe, and he has to cart his observers and subjects around in a huge arkship pondering along for generations just to reach from one star system to another? You almost groan out loud at the lack of imagination of god(or is it Clarke?) So if you are thinking of buying the book, definitely skip it - better to construct your own explanation than read this pathetic ending"
1,How to bludgeon a good idea into submission,"This book was a long soap opera. I got it as a gift, or I never would have purchased it. Does not communicate a sense of scientific wonder, which is in this reviewer's opinion, part of the duty of good science fiction."
4,Contemporary Poetry At Its Best!,"This collection of poetry is wicked! The author not only criticises the majority of issues pertinent to the youth in society, she does so with pizzaz and audacity. I have never read such a varied selection of poetry - love, hate, rape, drugs, alcoholism, suicide, going for a number 2 (I kid you not!) and felt that it was written both for and about me, making me feel slightly uneasy about my life!A definite life changer, but I can't help feeling that maybe the author's been there, done that, got the t-shirt.Value for money."
5,Understandable and Informative,"I just finished this book and I recommend it to anyone wanting a better understanding of what it means to be an Adult Child. If you are not sure you fall into this category, there are a few quizzes and questionaires that I thought did a good job of answering this question for me. Ive read other books on the subject, and this book did a good job of keeping the psychological babble to a minimum while making it educational and informative. The best thing I think it did was make me realize that I am sitll an adult child and where these issues possible stem from. I think it could have done better in exploring the different roles within a family structure. It definatly pushes 12-step groups and individual counseling which is a healthy next step with these kinds of issues. Its a great first read or refresher on this subject matter."
4,A Good Read,"This is a thorough book and has a lot of great information. It can be a bit clinical, but still offers insight into the results of dysfunctional family life."
4,Excellent dancing music,"My dance partner and I have performed to Farah Amira and Afrah Baladi many, many times. The tracks start out with slow, soulful saxophone music, then work their ways up to a climactic shimmy. Some of the songs sound similar to one another, but that's quite acceptable considering the calibre of Mostafa Sax's music. The music will make you dance despite yourself."
5,Moving Egyptian Baladi Music,Mostapha Sax is the master of the Egyptian quartertone Saxaphone. In this CD he provides a superb collection of emotional Baladi Taxims (improvisations).A must for every Middle Eastern Dancer! Every song is dancable.
1,too much sax,"I was disappointed by this CD - I found it very repetitive and the constant saxaphone grew to be more than irritating. I kept waiting to hear something other than beladi, but it never really developed any further than some quite nice beladi - it just never really got going. Good for practising beladi, that's all."
2,review,"somebody please get more samples availbale for this music, must have samples before I buy. colorful pictures."
5,Incredible Value,"My husband has had the Espressione Cafe Dolce Aroma now for over 6 months. We've used it at home, in the office and for parties. It has made hundreds upon hundreds of cups of wonderful espresso coffee beverages. Easy to easy, easy to clean and the performance in incredible for the price.I recommend this highly."
4,cool game,"Although the plot doesn't make much sense, Gv is a cool game. Its a little short and the aiming [is not good], but good graphics, the guns and generally blowing the snot out of things makes the game worth playing, a good addition to the Xbox collection."
4,Best gameplay in a while,"FAST and INTENSE gameplay. The mechanics of the gameplay are the best in any game I have EVER played (even better than NES' Ninja Gaiden series). It cannot get much better than this.The story should be a little more complete, and it should be a little longer. Maybe 24 levels instead.Plus I turned off the music because it was a little annoying.If anyone needs a good fix before the new Ninja Gaiden comes out I HIGHLY recommend GV it is SOO worth the price.~swank"
2,"Gun Valkyrie is ok, but it is nothing compared to Halo","I was a little put out on this game. I gave it a good hour, and I tried to get into it, but I could'nt. The fine people at Sega, I would say, missed a really good chance to make a really good game. Its basically a point and shoot game, but it does alot of the pointing for you. The controls are frustrating and the whole concept seems un-original. Like I said, its ok. But not a great game."
2,Disapointing Game,"I was pretty excited to play this game so I combed our local rental places until I found it. After half an hour my opionion could be summed up as ""I am so glad I didn't buy this game"".The controls are a little difficult but my real problem with the game is that it just isn't fun. The level objectives are ""kill all of the enemy units"" or ""find item x"" and you find that you spend an awfull lot of time combing the map to find that one guy that you missed. Very boring. Also, I've read quite a few reviews that say the graphics are impressive. They're not. The graphics are actually below par for an XBox game, and the music is downright bad. I didn't realize how important music was until I played this game.To sum up, pass on this game."
3,"Difficult, but fun.","The controls are a little difficult, it is hard for me to do certain ""dashes"" in the game, where you have to press a series of buttons all at once. However, it has great graphics, and you can play either a male or a female. Basically it is just a first-person shooter, not as advanced as Halo, but much simpler. I don't understand the difference between certain guns as I did in Halo. This is another game which you should try before you buy.Pros:1) Great Graphics2) 2 people to play3) FunCons:1) Not more than just 2 people to play (not enough characters)2) Annoying, especially when jumping from platform to platform and falling3) Levels take WAY to long (bores me out after a while)Remember, try before you buy."
2,Don't Buy This Game,"I kind of like ""Gun Valkyrie"", but after watching a number of friends and especially kids play it, I have to warn against spending $ on it. Two reasons:1. The controls for flying/jumping are over-complex, and several missions cannot be completed without this move, so you get stuck, and ultimately bored.2. You cannot save DURING a mission, so if you get bored with trying the same jump over and over, you will have to go back to the beginning of the mission if you don;t want to leave your XBOX running all night. This, IMHO is the biggest single mistake ANY manufacturer can make with a video game...As I said, I kind of enjoy the game, and my more dextrous gamer buddies have little problem with the controls, but a majority of ""casual"" gamers that I have watched play, get frustrated and even angry with the game. So I would have to recommend against buying it."
2,ok game,This is an Ok game. It would have been a little better if it WAS'NT SO FRICKIN HARD!!!!!!!!!!!It gets boring after the third level that is merely impossible.This game is a renter. DO NOT BUY IT.
1,Real POS,"Installation was straightforward, but I could only program this (along with the SWI-PS) to give me volume control.Worked for 15 minutes, then started throwing random commands to the stereo. The random commands got more and more frequent, to the point where I couldn't control the stereo from the controls -- I had to unplug the SWI.It got to the point where the LED just went out on it and the companion piece (SWI-PS in this case).Unit appears dead now."
4,"SpeedGrapher, the new Cowboy Bebop for the Urban Age",SpeedGrapher is a film noir piece by Gonzo that exceeded expectations of what anime could bring to this genre. With deep complex characters and intricate storylines. This is one anime that just may match although not surpass the standard set by Cowboy Bebop and other mature anime titles.
3,good book,I regret there is no this book in china.So I doesn't read this book.but I know it's good book.How can I buy this book?
4,Messages from the Archangels,"Archangels Speak gives an expanded and enlightening message. Afer hearing the message, I came away resonating with my own truth. If you are willing and open, this DVD will confirm more of what you know."
3,Nice item but obviously a promotional overrun,"Item works as advertised, but I was a little surprised to see a corporate logo on it when I opened it. Seems like this was some sort of promotional item overrun."
4,Worth the 15 dollars but not a magic cure,"I didn't have any 'PAIN' but it was still uncomfortable. However, I just finished a sprint triathlon in 10th place overall and 3rd in my division, using the band. It seems to be 'ok'.I review it on YouTube, here:<...>"
4,Wish it came with directions,"Once I figured out where to position the band and the pad that goes over the IT band, I've had good luck with it. It has lengthened the time I can run before pain sets in. Not a miracle but helpful."
3,"Unfortunately, it hasn't helped my ITBS","I've been using this strap for a few weeks when I run, but unfortunately, I haven't noticed much difference in my pain level with wearing it versus not wearing it. I've tried adjusting both where the strap is positioned on my leg and how tight I wear it, but I haven't had much success. It seems like the strap has really helped other folks, though. My theory is that its effectiveness might depend on the underlying cause of the IT band syndrome for each person. Maybe some mechanisms of injury respond better to using the strap than others.Even though it doesn't seem to help me, I still think it's worth considering for other folks. If you have ITBS and can spare the $15 or so, it might be worth a try to see if it helps you (since some people do seem to get a lot of relief from it). Good luck!"
3,Fits Well...Works Fair for me,"I've had IT Band syndrome for over 2.5 years, but was only led to that diagnosis recently. I decided to try this product after reading some good reviews.The fit is great, and it is a comfortable wrap; it definitely stays where you put it while you are running. Unfortunately for me, I have noticed only minimal support, but that may be because I have abnormally tight IT bands. Perhaps it will be more effective as I continue to stretch them out and massage out the scar tissue."
2,Did not work for me,This band did not do any for me in activity other than restrict my range of movement. I did have a very tight IT band from dancing for years. It might be better for runners. What worked? A super firm black roller and stretching out the hips.
5,Great Merchant,Product was delivered as promised with fast shipping. I am 100% pleased with my purchase.
5,A $16 Miracle,"After increasing my daily (running) mileage too much, too quickly, I ended up with a nasty case of I.T. band syndrome that almost completely sidelined me. For 3 months I couldn't get much past the 1 mile mark without limping home. When I found this product, I really didn't see how such a simple wrap could help with what I thought was a complex injury, but given how much pain each run created, the $16 gamble seemed worth it. What a miracle!! On my first run wearing this, I went 6 miles with absolutely zero pain. In the first couple weeks I forgot to put it on twice, and sure enough I again limped home after the first mile or two. After wearing it without fail for the next 4 months, the stabilization allowed my I.T. band to completely heal and I haven't needed it since. For anyone suffering with I.T. band syndrome, definitely give this a try."
4,Two more marathons...,"I'm actually entering a rewiew for my wife, who was having serious ITB issues up until a month ago, when we purchased the Pro-Tec ITB Compression Wrap. In the last 4 weeks, we have run a half marathon and 2 full marathons togethor and she wore the wrap in all 3 events, with no pain other than occasional tightness of the ITB. Without this product, we would probably have stayed home. We are planning our next marathon for the first week of May, and she will likely be wearing the wrap again. This is no cure, but certainly allows her to keep running."
3,sweaty and slips,"This sort of helps my IT band, but much better was the Adidas Techfit tights with power web...however, they are $60. I have some hamhocks for thighs, so this barely meets the velcro. I wear a women's size 6 pants. That might give you an idea that this won't work for a big dude."
5,IT Band it's a rap,This is the perfect product for my needs! I'm so glad I had a friend recommend it to me. I ran a 1/2 marathon and never had to adjust the band around my knee. On top of that the strap applied the right amount of pressure to the point I needed it and my knees were not sore(sp?) the next day. I would recommended them to anyone who has knee pain after running.
4,Great Fast Fix,This is a great product for the fast fix. Works the first time you use it. Would not reccomend this product for someone who constantly has ITB problems because it does slip. This was great for me until I could stretch my band out and be able to run without one again. If you are looking to see if bands work for your problem I would say get this one!
4,Well designed,"I'm going to review the quality of this product and not how well it works. I purchased the product to help with Illiotibial Band Syndrome (ITBS), but it is probably not going to work for me due to some stainless steel plates that were mounted on my femur decades ago and never removed. I did some pretty complete research before I purchased this product and I am convinced that the theory is good and the product is good. I knocked it back one star because the instructions are inadequate. There are a couple videos on you-tube that may be helpful. Once you know where to place the strap, it goes on easily and stays in place. The back is rubberized and has a cross-hatch pattern so it doesn't slip - at least it didn't on me. It fits snugly with no loose ends to come loose. If I were to use this several times a week, I would expect it to last about a year - maybe longer."
3,Didn't work for my tight IT bands,"This may work for others, but it did not work for me. I had better luck with Meuller Max strap, although neither worked perfectly, physical therapy is currently helping.I had severe knee pain on the outside of my knee around 20 minutes into my runs.I went to orthopedic who said my IT bands were too tight, he said he could see them through my skin which wasn't normal.I started PT where I get a quick painful massage, ultrasound, then stretching (quad, hams,and IT band) and building up the muscles on outside of leg (side leg lifts, bridge w/kicks, side step w/band) and that has helped.I hope this helps!"
4,Working so far,Been on 4 to 6 mile runs and have had no knee problems whatsoever. I'll keep pushing the distance to see how they do but so far I am a fan. I am running again!
3,Good product,"This is a good product. Worked well for me. However, after more than a few miles, it did start to slip as my leg started to sweat with the band around my leg."
3,Mixed feelings,"I like that this IT Band strap has a small padded area to provide extra pressure on the IT band. It works well to wear during the day when my knee is bothering me. That being said, it doesn't work at all for running, at least not for me. I found that as soon as I start sweating (I'm in Kuwait) the band gets slippery and just slides down over my knee. So, great product, as long as you don't sweat."
5,Actually works,"I ran a half marathon and had major IT Band issues after. For 6 months my IT Band was bothering me whenever I ran 2 miles or more. I read reviews and watched a Youtube video about it and decided why not try it. Me being inpatient, my first run with the wrap was 5 miles. I was able to run the 5 miles without any issues/soreness/tightness. It was awesome. If you are someone that has IT Band Syndrome I highly recommend the wrap. It won't solve all of the problems but will definitely alleviate a lot of them."
2,"Cheap, a little uncomfortable and doesn't work","I got this hoping it would help with my IT band issues. Not only did it not work, but I had to constantly adjust it on the run as it has a tendency to bite into your leg if it's not perfectly positioned.I think the company paid Scott Jurek to use his image using it, that's about the only good thing I could determine about this product."
2,Didn't do anything for my IT Band syndrome,"I tweaked my IT band 3 weeks before marathon. Purchased this product in hopes of getting some relief since I was not about to stop running and rest the leg (until after the marathon). The product did nothing positive for me. After a week or so of experimenting with it during training runs, I completed my training and ran the marathon without it."
1,Don't waste your money,"I don't feel that this was any help at all to the IT Band, I would not recommend this product."
3,"Didn't solve my problem, but maybe that's not what it's for","I'm not sure that my running problem is centered around my IT band, so I'm not sure that I should expect this band to help me. It did help reduce the popping that I experienced in the joint connecting my fibula to my knee, but it took a lot of fooling around with it before that happened. Plus, I don't think it resolved the issue at all."
2,Irritation and break-out on legs,"I walk about six miles a day on my job and I don't believe these are intended to wear for an eight hour shift(40 hours a week). The material next to your skin is rubber (does not breath) and causes irritation and break outs that take forever to go away. Itches like crazy! This product does support and relieve leg pain, but I would not recommend this brand to others who need to wear on a regular basis. Another employee bought these also and had the same problem that I did, so it's the product, not the user. I recommend a product that 'breathes' as a better alternative to these."
2,Why this thing has to be so expensive?,"I found a pair of stretchable Velcro bands at Lowes for $4.97 and it does the job nicely. So compare the price: 2 for $4.97 or 2 for $30. If you are not sure if this works or not, just go to Lowes and get the stretchable and try it out."
2,It didn't work for me,"It didn't work for me. It arrived in a timely manner in good enough packaging. The quality seems fine. I only used it once, because it didn't work for me. Your experience may be different. I did wind up in physical therapy, because the IT band pain became too great, so my condition may have been too severe for this to work for me."
3,IMHO this item runs small,"Measuring my leg 3"" above the knee put me easily in the small range.No way is that right for me as this device put to much strain on the tendons running down the back of the leg.I have found it works ok for Patella tendon issues though."
4,Still felt alot of pain while running but...,"After running 3 miles I started having pain on the side of the knee. After the first day the pain went away the next morning, however after the next run I couldn't walk the next day. Gave it time to heal, 2 weeks, started stretching , got the strap and went running.. After a mile I got the same pain, it was really bad and I ended up walking back home the rest of the way. However I was absolutely pain free the next day ..I'll continue stretching, then put the strap back on and go for another run, hopefully things get better."
5,Very Helpful for my Aching ITBS!,"I developed ITBS this summer from over use, too much interval training. I had knifing pains in the side and back of the knee and lower thigh and was unable to walk down hill or down stairs. Although I was skeptical at first, I started using this strap and found that it greatly improved my ability to exercise and walk without pain. The strap allowed me to exercise MODERATELY while re-habbing the leg. This product is well made and substantial. One bit of advice - peel the band off gently when done exercising. I was ripping it off quickly after my workouts - the Velcro started to separate a bit from the band. So I am now careful with it and it is holding up very well. I highly recommend it!!"
1,Useless,"As one who attended one of Oncken, Jr's seminars, and found that his instruction had a major positive impact on the effectiveness of management at all levels, this brief piece isn't even a good ""Reader's Digest"" version. Also, Covey's comentary shows that he never gained the original Oncken message. Oncken's message, properly put into action, was the essence of affective empowerment.Please refund my seven bucks for this useless pamphlet."
5,This is an invaluable how-to book for individuals & groups,"George Fraser has written a common-sense guide for networking and getting ahead. It includes anecdotes, charts, graphs and folk wisdom. Every home should have this reference book."
4,Cattleman's Courtship,"Lois Faye Dyer delivers again. No one writes with such authenticity about cowboys. The sexual tension zings--she maintains it from beginning to end. If I didn't have a guy I'm crazy about, I'd be heading to Montana in hopes of finding a Quinn Bowdrie of my own."
4,Romance that sizzles through to the end!,"The characters of Colton come to life in Lois Faye Dyer's latest creation. Sensual heat between Quinn and Victoria ignite the pages...until HE discovers what SHE does for a living. Then the sparks fly, and tempers flare even as the charred remains of romance smolder beneath the surface. It's only after Victoria's love releases Quinn's heart from the past, that this cowboy understands the true value of self-respect."
5,Fluffles the lamb,"I bought Fluffles for our five month old grandson as his primary Christmas gift. I searched many web sites and looked at many stuffed animals. Fluffles was chosen by description for his age appropriate size, his soft texture, his stitched face (no button eyes or nose), for his gentle expression, and for the reasonable price. I did see it cheaper in a local, privately owned toy store a month later, but it didn't cost much more online. Our grandson is not quite ready for it yet, but his Mama and 22 month-old brother loved it, and I am sure he will too."
2,Did Lord Byron (posthumously) actually conduct this? (I.E. is Thieleman a fraud or merely a fool?),"Having spent a lot of time in the mountains where the Manfred play is set, I can understood how a lone conductor might lose his way, lost in a Caspar Friedrich meditative pose. But I was still baffled by this Manfred. Thielemann seems to think he's in touch with noble spirits here, and one of them surely is Otto Klemperer, whose ghost hovers about the slower tempi inflicted on the piece. I have to admit, at moments, I heard things I've never heard before, and some of them were nice to know! But overall, I think that Lenny B. and John Eliot Gardiner deliver much more satisfying Schumann than this team, who seem to have confused the composer of Dichterliebe with that of Lohengrin."
2,"Mediocre Konzertstuck, Unorthodox tempos","I was somewhat disappointed by this album. The Konzertstuck, a magnificent and devilishly difficult work for four horns and orchestra, receives a solid but unspecial performance. Thielemann's tempos, particularly in the Schumann Symphony #2, seem ponderous and rather unorthodox. FOr the second symphony I much prefer Wolfgang Sawallisch's recording.What I still find bewildering is that DG produced the greatest-ever recording of the Konzertstuck and yet that recording is now out of print. The Chicago Symphony Orchestra recorded the Konzertstuck in the 1970s, with principal hornist Dale Clevenger playing the high part. Those guys produced a spectacular ""wall of sound"" with pinpoint precision and accuracy. And, the CSO of course is a much better orchestra than the Philharmonia. Hopefully, someday DG will re-release this recording digitally remastered."
2,"Nice Pictures, But Little Else",The other reviewers offered the assessment that this book contained a great deal of information useful for the pursuit of anything with gills in Texas. I have to disagree. It is simply a picture book with very little fishing advice.
3,Not same as pictured,I just received this product in the mail and the adapter is not the same as the one in the photo.
3,Still in box,"I bought the Horn bec my air horn was giving me problems. After I got the horn sent to me, the air horn started to work properly. I will be holding on to the new horn just in case."
2,Rewriting History,What a shame Walt no longer is with us. He knew the value of truth and had no qualms in presenting things as they really were. Why can't we face history without re-writing/watering it down? This was a great movie in its original format. I loved it as a child and Uncle Remus was a wonderful figure for me. I only wish my own grandson would have been able to see it. SHAME on the people running Disney these days. Bring it back as it was. Anyone who was offended by it never understood its true value. It was warm and caring and a great movie. How sad we've come to this.
2,Song of the South? Not really.,"This tape, while nice, provides only about five minutes of actual Song of the South content. If you're looking for the whole movie, this is *not* the way to go."
3,ZIP-A-DEE-DOO=DAH!,"DISNEY, WHATS WRONG WITH YOU ! this is not a racial movie .This tape contained little of song of the south . I would love to see the original movie again . Whats next get rid of Splash Mountain ! WAKE UP!p.s. You can buy song of the south (from the U.K.online)!"
2,political corectness,it is truly a shame that the original movie is not available because of political corectness. just because it may be unpopular with certain ethnic groups does not mean that you will change or rewrite history simply by keeping the original movie off the market and away from an audience who has seen the movie and would like to see the ORIGINAL movie again.
3,Song Of The South,"Luckily the NAACP has no influence in Europe where a friend got me a copy of this movie which I treasure. ...Mine is also in English, no subtitles."
2,Song of the Redux,"Disney is coming out with a 21st Century version of the film ""Song of the South"". In this version Morgan Freeman will play Dr. Remus, a highly respected clinical psychologist from a northern state.His main focus will be on reprogramming the children with politically correct tunes and discovering some environmentally hazardous chemical in the water which causes adolescent onset bigotry.The film's musical finale will highlight this extravaganza as all the young folk south of the Mason-Dixon line gather in the ""Global Children's Villiage"". There will not be an adult without a tissue to his/her eye. For that matter there will not be an adult."
1,original song of the south,"I have lost all respect for Disney by not re-releasing Song of the South and or the DVD or VHS..everyone of the disney movies for children have more violence that this movie..also the love of blacks and whites is the best, warm, loving..someone send these reviews to Disney for us..thanks"
5,Song of the South / The Movie,"I saw this movie several times when I was quite young. I am 74 years old and have 12 Grandchildren who would enjoy this movie. I certainly hope Disney can release this movie. My Grandchildren were brought up as many other children in the world to respect anyone's Race, Color or Creed. I find nothing wrong with ""Song of The South."" I think children today can learn a lot from the story. Thank you for listening to me."
2,Need to read about the tape,"When I bought this tape I was looking for ""Song of the South"" & that is what I typed in. When this tape information came up I didn't totally read it so I ordered it. When I found out that I did not order ""Song of the South"" but a Sing Along Songs, Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah it was too late to do anything about it. I bought it from a outside vender so I could not cancel the order. It did arrive quite fast but it was not what I thought I had ordered. It is kind of cute & does show a tiny part of Song of the South but very little. Then I checked to see how long the tape was & it was only 26 minutes. And I paid $19.74 for a 26 minutes tape that wasn't even the one I wanted. From now on when I order a tape I will read everything before I order it."
2,zip a dee doo DUD!,This tape is good and we all love the songs but the tape is only 15 minutes long...kind of a dud really....thank you...
3,Original Song of the South Video,"I don't understand -- what's so controversial about the original movie? Friendship between blacks and whites? People with goodness in them? Give me a break. We can show murder, rape, violence, evil, but this movie is controversial? I think Disney must either be out of their minds, OR they're planning some big and expensive release of the movie. I bought a pirated copy, and I thoroughly enjoy watching it along with my two little girls. They'll watch that over violent and evil movies any day!"
5,Song of the South,"I was so sorry to hear that another children's favorite was taken from us, Song of the South. Always loved Uncle Remus and his song and characters."
3,Shameful,I ditto the several responses made regarding this issue!I've had wonderful memories of this movie and wanted thatfor my kids. To find that this is impossible is OUTRAGIOUS!The video is really a disgrace to the wonderful theme and joy of this movie.Shame on you Disney!I am absolutely discussed with the hypocrisy that is currently Disney's theme. It seems to me that this has escalated since the new CEO took office. I'm definitely rethinking taking my kids to Disney Land.
5,PROUD OF THIS FILM!!,"fOR ANYONE TO THINK THAT THIS MOVIE IS POLITICALLY INCORRECT OR INCORRECT IN ANY WAY IS INSANE!!..THE <JUNK> THAT IS PUT OUT NOW IN THE NAME OF ""FAMILY ENTERTAINMENT"" CANNOT EVEN COME CLOSE TO THIS FILM!..I AM ANGLO (THAT'S WHITE FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO PREFER WORDS INSTEAD OF TRUTH!), I WAS RAISED IN THE SOUTH, AND I WAS RAISED BY A BLACK WOMAN THAT LOVED THIS FILM!..IT IS ALL IN THE WAY YOU LOOK AT THINGS AND AT YOURSELF..SO..WHERE CAN I GET A COPY..IF ANYONE KNOWS?"
2,Bummed and Wanting the Original,"I find it ridiculous that we still live in a era of prejudice that prevents the viewing and the right to own ""The Song of The South"". I have the privilege of having ""Black Roots"" going back to the Civil War Era, my Great2x Grandmother having been Black in a time when she would've been hung for being married to a White Man. And still someone is telling people what they can and cannot have in the privacy of their own home. People need to get over themselves and accept their own History and remember that Uncle Remus was only one of many Good Black folks, who knew and could see open Hearts, he saw and accepted beyond Color Boundries. That took Great Courage and a Good Kind Heart in a time of cowardice and greed. If anything ""The Song of the South"" needs to be regarded as art and a reminder that should bind us together, not push us apart. If anything we should LEARN from, not HIDE from the lessons that Movie has to offer."
4,It's a Cruel World !,"""Song of the South"" did depict the old South as it was. Is that so bad? There are many movies on the market that tell it like it was on many different subjects. Take for example, ""Gone with the Wind"" That movie shows war and destruction and slavery and misery and death in the South and it's not banned. Just because slavery is dead doesn't mean it never happened. Did any slave get mistreated in ""Song of the South""? NO! The emphasis was on the relationship of a little child and the stories that were told by his friend ""Uncle Remus"". It was pure magic!"
1,this is insane,...just exactly how will children learn from our mistakes in the past if people censor them as if they never happened?
1,Not as expected,"I expected songs from the film ""Song of the South"", which I saw many, many years ago and wanted the songs for my myself and for my grandchildren. I know film is not for children now, but would love to own it and video of the songs just for myself. I Was disappointed."
1,DO NOT BUY HOBBYZONE,"OK, this is a great plane. It flies well and it has tremendous potential as a first trainer. It has virtually no drawbacks and no bad habits in terms of its flying pattern. HOWEVER, the plane has a fatal flaw and that is the very very very very very poor construction of the boom.The thing is so brittle it will not take a hard landing, let along a crash. If Hobbyzone descides to modify the boom, which should be extremely easy to do, this plane will be the best thing in the market for beginners. As it is now, it is essentially useless because it cannot do what a beginner needs most: withstand a crash.Given the fact that the boom is bonded to the pod and it cannot be extracted without deamging that part of the fuse, one would think that HZ is just trying to force us to buy the fuse over and over again."
1,DO NOT BUY,"This plane is terribly fragile. My son has owned the plane less than a week and it is already trashed. The tail design is very poor. Once the joint in the tail breaks (45 minutes of flight), you must replace the fuselage ($35). DO NOT waste your money!!!"
4,Hoagy,Best songwriter ever. With a jazz tilt. I have been a fan since the 1940s and this album pretty much covers his work.
1,Buyer beware,"PLEASE do not waste your time or money on this software. It is utterly inadequate for the most basic tasks of tracking ""which customer owes you how much money for how long"" (accounts receivable). Buy some real bookkeeping software instead of this ersatz, cheap, poorly-written application. If you just want a pretty invoice, you can do that BETTER in your own word processor! It's discouraging that the publisher of this program continues to sell such junk. For 40 bucks, you probably won't even bother to demand a refund. Since each copy costs about a dollar to produce, that's quite a profit."
2,Blah blah blah and {yawn},Whatever - very fluffy - very psycho-babblish. Was expecting Christ-centered stuff and it wasn't even close. Wasn't looking to be pet - wanted to be stronger as I had 4 kids still to take care of.
3,Decent quality except for the button sewing,"My son loves the coat and it's exactly what he was looking for in a pea coat.The only complaint is that the buttons are very poorly sewn on and the first day he wore the coat, 4 of them came off. He lost one, but luckily there are a couple of extra buttons sewn onto the inside of the coat. I had to resew all the buttons to make sure they will stay on. Otherwise, great coat and it has a great fit. True to size."
1,false advertising,"The website states that this jacket has an interior pocket but it does not. This feature is was very important to my son and he is quite dissapointed. You can buy this same jacket for much less if you shop around. The only reason that I spent the extra money was because of my son's desire for the interior pocket. This is classic bait and switch, you will not receive the product advertised."
3,"Liked looks, not quality","I ordered two of these coats for my sons. The material balls up really bad and the buttons started falling off one by one, sometimes the same day of wear. I did love the look of it....it was just what I was looking for. But the quality really was a let down."
3,Coat,The service of this company is great. But the coat was either to small or to large. It didn't fit just right.
1,Major Button Problems,"I usually like Rothco items, but I have to give my first ever 1 star rating to an item due to the poor quality. EVERY button has fallen off this coat so far after about 4 times being worn. I am not exaggerating when I say every single button has come off. The material also has a shedding quality that shows how poor the fabric is. My son loves the look and actually treats his stuff very well so we have been surprised by the issues. I would advise you to stay away or at the very least strengthen the thread for the buttons when you receive it."
1,Sent this one back,"This coat looks great in the photo;however, it fits huge on my son. It also balls up as others have described. I sent this back and received a credit."
3,pure 80's,"I'll admit it: I bought this for just one track: ""Eyes of a Stranger"", which I recalled from hearing it back in the 80's but had somehow never managed to find on CD.Most of the other tracks do not hold up well outside the 80's context. I doubt I'll listen again. One that caught my attention that I'm not sure if I remember ever hearing on the radio was ""Where is this Love"" which is pretty good and I'll likely listen to again (unlike the rest)."
1,Poor Little Bear,This poor little bear had a cigarette burn in her pretty little ballerina skirt. One can only imagine the horrors. She was to be a gift to a real live ballerina but the burn put an end to those plans.
3,Hollywood Does not equal popular belief,"Throughout the book, the author continually uses Hollywood movies as proof that the beliefs she advocates were popularly believed. Often she does not provide solid proof when she states that an idea was popularly believed by Americans. Movies may be popular because they are a great story, but that does not necessarily mean they reflected American's belief. Hollywood is good for entertainment, not necessarily a good metric for Americans' beliefs."
2,Homeward Bound,"I do not like the book, it has nothing to do with American History which is the class that I am reading it for. I think it is boring, and cannot read it at night unless I want to go to sleep. Would not recommend this book unless you just have to read it for a class."
3,homeward bound,Book in worst conditions than expected - seems to have been in a flood (it had some weird dust and some kind of smell) - but it is still usable. It was really cheap though. Shipping was ok.
1,Bought two of them one stopped working in less a day.,I bought two of these lights for my garden tractor.I modified the light buckets to accept the h3 bulb.I installed them and was very careful i did not touch the glass on the bulbs.The one light clouded over upon turning them on.Less a day and it gave out and stopped working.Maybe i got a bad bulb from the manufacture.Instead of sending it in and waiting i just tossed them in the junk and went with a 55 watt from Advance Auto.
2,Fun While It Lasted...And Expensive...,"Broke it. Had the rails extended and the pad in the down position and rested for a moment with the weight of the camera balanced on my knee and ""CRACK!"", all gone now. I actually didn't use it too often, mostly only after operating the camera for an extended period of time. I loved the way it fit on the camera, and fact that it was so light weight, but for what this item costs, this thing should be as strong as titanium. I'm out a major chunk of cash now."
1,TOO COSTLY,"I didn't buy this....tho I could use it and want it. Just TOOOOO expensive for what it is! If money is not a problem...go for it. I spent $3500 on the Sony FX7 but refuse to spend this price for a ""brace!"""
1,not worth it,"althought after the initial treatment the paint did feel really slick, that wears off after the first washing. there is still some beading 6 months later but not much else. and there is no cleaning or polishing attributes to this sealant. for my money, i feel any wax thats half the price or less gives just as much or better protection. try the mirror glaze cleaner wax, mothers cleaner wax, nu finish polish, or zymol cleaner wax instead. klasse all-in-one works great but it is kind of expensive, a little goes a long way, and kinda tricky to apply"
1,Left Streaks Tha Won't Come Out,"I tried this product (Meguiar's paint sealant) and it left streaks in my paint that I can't get out. I have used other brands of polymer paint sealant and they have been FAR superior to wax, and have never had an issue. I don't know what went wrong - I have contacted the manufacturer but haven't heard back yet. More to come..."
5,The Standard!,There are a ton of boutique products out there and I tried a few in the past but always come back to Meguiar's. This time I am gonig to stay! This is an old tried and true standard. Easy on and easy off I do recommend a DA machine though...hand rubbing just sucks. You really should clay first but you knew that right...poilsh too if needed. Get the paint ready for the final step and it works sooooo well. I dont even really know that you would need anything after this but thats a personal pref...
2,Too negative,"I purchased this book for my granddaughter (age 8), whose parents never married and don't live together. I read it first and gave it to her mother to decide. We both felt that, although there was a happy ending, it presented a terribly negative view of the father and the mother."
5,Superb!,This set is well worth the price. The set has consistently high quality and the information provided is very helpful. Highly recommend this investment in beautiful music for a lifetime.
1,It doesn't work in my camera,"When inserted in my camera, the camera asked for a lithium battery.This is supposed to be a replacement but it isn't."
2,not impressed,Well made but very uncomfortable. The padding on the seat is not flat so you constantly lean forward. Padding is hard.. almost like sitting on plastic. Not sure how long I will keep this before trying something different.
4,"Vivacious, if occasionally mannered Messiah","Rene Jacobs was bound to get around to Messiah sooner or later and here it is. The soloists are all excellent, ornamenting the music tastefully if in a rather mannered fashion and without being very memorable. The chorus and orchestra are also excellent, but their work is the most affected by Jacobs' idiosyncracies. He has them interpolate trills at many cadential moments when one simply wants to get on with it and the fussy staccato articulation of the text in some of the choruses will be annoying to some. Surely this is due to Jacobs wanting to put his own personal stamp on the work (God knows it has been recorded almost to death), but in its own way it is entertaining and the overall music-making is joyful and life-affirming. I wouldn't recommend this as a first version, but if one already has a number of versions of Messiah and wants to hear a different take on a familiar work splendidly performed, this should fit the bill nicely."
5,A very Different Messiah,"If you want a 2nd version of the Messiah which is not a typical war horse with a full symphony backing, thisis the version for you. It has a wonderful delicacy in soloists, chorus and orchestra. The audio is excellentso in the chorus's the words are still distinct and the timbre of the instruments is also pronounced. Anexcellent addition to my library."
4,Useful and useful!,I feel it is little bit thinner than I expected but paper quality is awesome and very useful.I like it.
4,nice trace,nice professional quality muted yellow trace. not like that white stuff that non-professionals are drawn to because it looks more like regular paper or that hideous bright yellow that noobs like to use
3,HVAC Code Ceck,Needs to be updated to include IBC 2003. Still showing 2002. Don't expect a new edition. Note printing of June 2002.
1,"""WARNING, BEWARE""","I bought three books at the same time, recieved two within seven days of the order. The third has yet to come. Contacted the vendor and he stated that it must be lost in the mail and offered to re-ship or re-fund, I wanted to re-ship because I needed this book for my work. Waited a couple of weeks and sent an e-mail asking when the book had been re-shipped, got and e-mail back but didn't state the date it was shipped but said if I didn't recieve it in three days they would give me a refund. Well have not gotten the book after 40 days. Not sure if I will get a refund like they state but if you are looking for a quick and no hasel transaction don't look here."
2,Good for one time use,The cups were a nice size but quickly melted even though the chocolate had been allowed to cool before pouring into the molds.It was good for one time use but I've had more success with other brands. I've never had a melting issue with others unless I put them in the dishwasher.
2,Disappointed,"The picture looks like it would be some type of metal or even heavy plastic, but when it arrived it was clear plastic. Didn't look anything like the picture."
3,No Blend,Shotgun Slade was watchable and somewhat entertaining. However the jazzed up musical score does not fit this series.
3,VERY DARK STORY!,"There are several brutal rape scenes in this story, so if you are sensitive to that you will want to pass on this book. A lot of anger and hatred, but several romance scenes as well. Personally, I like a story where I can really like the ""hero."" But you can't really enjoy this guy. He's angry and vengeful from start to nearly finish.Also, there are several pages in the book that you can totally skip without losing the story at all... because the author goes into way too much of the life memories of characters who are not important to the story at all.If you can find a cheap used copy, give it a swing. But don't hope for too many happy feelings while reading it."
1,Horrible,The descriptions of their coming together orally made me want to throw up. He kissed his seed off her lips? GROSS.
1,These Aussie men really are beyond the pale!,"I'm a big fan of Linda Lael Miller's Western romances and her other work, but with The Legacy she has really messed up. Ian Yarbro is an unbelievable 'hero' ( and not just because he continually addresses his lady as 'sheila'- the term is not used in this way! ) but because he's just so one-dimensional. If I'd been the central female character I think I'd have cut my own throat and not just out of boredom, but because I would not be able to live with my own masochism.I know the peculiarly Australian forms of misogyny can be very hard to combat, but in this book there seems to be no other option for the heroine but to shut off her brain and subside into a semi-vegetative state. Even the dear little boy can't save this book. Awful"
2,"For a definitive biography, not very definitive","TURKENHIRSCH is said to be the definitive biography of the philanthropist Baron Moritz de Hirsch, and Amazon searched for a copy for me for almost a year. So, pleased as I am with this Amazon service, I was disappointed when this biography finally arrived.The only other work on Baron de Hirsch that I have been able to find, MOSES OF THE NEW WORLD by Samuel Lee, turned out to be far superior.To say the least, TURKENHIRSCH is skimpy with background and detail. Admittedly, the topic itself does not lend to lively writing. While neither book does justice to this many facets of this fascinating man, MOSES OF THE NEW WORLD will be a more useful resource to anyone doing research on the Baron and his philanthropies."
3,Not as good as the TV series,"Overall, this OAV series is a good bargain, well packaged, and entertaining.But... the OAV episodes are noticeably inferior to the Original TV series.If you are an avid fan of the TV series, that has watched a lot of episodes from each season, you'll be somewhat disappointed by this OAV series.It just doesn't really capture the personality of the original TV series. I just didn't feel the Ranma magic in this one. I can't place my finger on what is missing--perhaps some story elements are weak and the comic timing is off.On the positive side, the animation is great and the DVD is packed with many features.Hopefully, VIZ will release all the Original TV seasons onto DVD. That would be a much better buy."
4,Yup it's Ranma!,"If you buy this thinking you'll start at the begining . . . you might be pretty dissapionted. All the episodes here are based on stories in the later Ranma 1/2 manga(comic books).It starts around book 20 and I'm still seeing the stories in book 30 (Japanese books, the Viz graphics versions are in the same order but they seem to put 1&1/2 Japanese manga into one of their graphic novels.) They seem to keep the same continuity as the books mostly, so if you're a solid Ranma 1/2 fan you'll be happy.The film quality is pretty good and the stories they chose seemed to work on film.Some of the stories are Shampoo & the Contrary Brooch,Tendo X-mas Scramble,The Tunnel of ... Broken ... Love, The Two Akanes plus more.Tanoshima!"
5,"Ranma 1/2 is by far the best anime around, and this is why..","If you dont know the story of Ranam 1/2 its about a boy named...Ranma Saotome who went training with his father (Genma) in Jusenkyo, China. This training ground is cursed and has Springs of drowned SOMETHINGS, While training Genma falls into Spring of drowned Panda, so when splashed with cold water, Genma turns to a panda and splashed with hot water turns back to a man. And Ranma...well he fell in spring of drowned girl. So you gessed it, he turns into a girl.Animation is top notch (like the MOTION PICTURES)The first one (Shampoos Sudden Switch...) is by far the best! Order this now!This OAV set is wounderful!There are 12 all together and 4 of then (All on second DVD) are in two parters! (LOL Soan crys all through #6!)They also added some cool stuff like all the music videos from the VHS versions! (You just got to love Baled of Ranma and Akana)Anyway i do recomend this for alll Ranma fans and for all ANME lovers out there!!"
2,Weak,"I bought this based on the reviews from here.... only one that has failed miserably.Story, comic, animation was all mediocre. 1 out of 6 episodes was pretty good... rest were just WEAK."
5,Jim Delahanty,"All I can say is..Finally! I rented the 1st of this series by accident at a Blockbuster one day and all I can say is... I as hooked! The stories funny, the charecters interesting and the voices were the best I had seen in any dubbed anime. The Episodes on this set are the OAV (Original Animation Videos)that were released sporadically while the series continued. For example in my all-time favorite episode ""Stormy Weather:Growng Up with Miss Hinako"" - We are introduced to Hapossi long before he was introduced in the series. Still, without watching the series, you can and will enjoy this set. A MUST for any Ranma fan!"
1,"Not helpful at all, way too technical","Even though I am fairly confident with computers, and quite knowlegable of basic computer usage and components, this left me in a total fog. I got a ""dummies"" book because I had no experience whatsoever in wireless, hoping to learn a bit more. This books assumes you already understand wireless and know exactly what all the abbreviations mean.It was absolutely useless as a beginner manual."
2,Severely Out Of Date,"This was an excellent book for its time, but that was '05-'06. This is an obviously rapidly evolving technology and a book like this, (or the buyers of it), deserve an annual update. After shelling out the cash for this book, and admittedly, learning quite a bit, I'm searching for a guide that goes beyond the XP OS and gives more than a brief mention to the new n-standard. This was probably a four star book in '05, but now provides outdated, and possibly dangerous, security setup info. It should be taken off the market until it is updated."
5,Awed for Days,"This compelling and exquisitely wrought novel from a National Book Award and Pen-Faulkner Award finalist at once luminous and discreet is Hugh Nissensons masterpiece.At 67, Artie Rubin, author of illustrated books of mythology, finds his world shaken to its foundation. With breathtaking insight into the human condition and a delightful dry sense of humor, Nissenson finds the symbols, the language, and the wisdom to shed light on seemingly unfathomable aspects of all our lives.Even as it questions the meaning and purpose of life, The Days of Awe resonates on many levels, offering a story of heartbreak and hope, portraying the souls endurance and confirming the fidelity of love, all while laying bare the myths of post-millennial America. An amazing read- I HIGHLY recommend it."
3,Loved Artie and Johanna...,"Artie Rubin, 67, lives in the Upper West Side, with his wife Johanna. Artie struggles with his aging and is certain that he will die at 73 (year his father died). Then his wife Johanna suffers a heart attack. Author does a marvelous job in developing the characters of Artie and Johanna with the day-to-day travails of work, family and faith. When involving the two leading characters, the book is funny, moving and compelling. It is when the author broadens the novel to other characters and events (9/11, Middle East, secularism, religion, friends), I thought the book and storyline lost its way."
5,"A masterful story of life, love, and death","This is book to read and reread as one absorbs the meaning of life, tragedy, and love. Funny, heartbreaking, and humane."
1,For thoughtful readers,"I grew up in a small town about 10 miles from where Dr. Maciejczyk practices and he was, in fact, my parents' family doctor during the 70s and 80s. I knew him as a good man but I had no idea that he was such a prolific writer.My brother gave me this book for Christmas and I am about a third of the way through it. It's a little difficult to read because of the language issue but it is interesting to see what has happened in the 20 years since he began those writings. Even if you have problems as you begin reading, stick with it. You get used to his language style and it begins to read more easily.Dr. M was right on so many issues, especially those of the welfare state, the effects of malpractice insurance and government interference in healthcare delivery. I don't agree with all of his political viewpoints but I certainly can understand them.He has a unique view on the world and it's well worth your time and effort to look at it."
4,OK Book,"The first third of the book is simple Indian costumes. Not what I would have expected from the cover. The information in the book is helpful, but the historic patterns from Simplicity or McCall's are much easier to use."
1,A dull story,I didn't like this story because it was kind of misleading.And it's not because Data's a cadet. The story didn't have data's personality that much. . The story was just a bit boring but it did have the planet where data was discovered. Over all it was an okay book.
5,Small but So Supportive ...,"This title is small but packs alot of support and positive words toward the abuse victim. Chapter topics include HEALING IS POSSIBLE, THE DECISION TO HEAL, UNDERSTANDING THAT IT WASN""T YOUR FAULT, THE CHILD WITHIN and more. All written with an under tone of support. There are also several stories of abuse told from the surviving victims view. The title is filled with insight and support and is best described as an excellent beginning point for those looking to heal. A very sensitive and difficult subject that is well addressed."
5,Creeker,"This was a great book and I hope she writes more. It was written in a way that you could invision it all. If you like to read about mountian people, and days gone by, then you will love this book."
3,Lack of depth leaves more questions than insights.,"The author and I share a similar story. I looked forward with hope to an insightful book from a psychologist 'smarter than arey tack.' Instead I found that the author simply described the events of her life. The book lacked any depth in recounting the author's motives or those of the people around her. I and countless others shared a similar path out of the creek and into academic and professional lives through Pikeville College. This book doesn't do her, or our, story justice. I hope she writes again. And I hope the next time she goes deeper."
5,Highly recommend!,I began this book yesterday afternoon and couldn't put it down until I read the very last line. It made me laugh out loud and I cried several times too. This is an honest book and I am recommending it to all my friends. -- Margot --
5,Freaking awesome,Omg this was an amazing book. Had me guessing till the very last page. Highly recommend this book to anyone who loves suspense like I do.
5,Absolutely FANTASTIC,"Have you ever read a book and had the ending freak you out so much that you threw the book across the room???Well, that was my experience when I read ""Black for Remembrance"".I am a very hard critic and rarely do I read a book that I can remember years later.I have read an enormous amount of mystery/suspense and this is by far one of the best thrillers I have ever had the privilege of reading.From the first page to the last, I was completely enthralled. There is not a slow part to the story.This book will stay with you long after it ends. At least it has for me.Carlene Thompson is a brilliant author."
3,Fair to midland,"I read this book in a couple days. I found it to be just okay. I thought the writing was very simplistic.I probably won't read any more of her stuff unless I'm desperate. On the other hand, right now I'm also reading The Strain by Guillermo Del Toro and Chuck Hogan and I am enjoying that. I'll review that book when I'm done with it."
5,Much better than any Mary Higgins Clark,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It was very suspenseful and for once I couldn't guess who dun it! It kept you wanting to turn the pages. My only greivance: that it didn't explain why the killer kept writing ""black for remeberance"" on all the boquets. (You'll know what I mean once you read the book.) Highly recommened."
4,Suspenseful But Not Her Best,"I love her books but the ending on this one was too contrived. She keeps you in suspense throughout the book and you don't want to put it down; however at the end, I felt let down."
3,"Well written, suspenseful, but I didn't care for the plot","I like this author, but this book's storyline was disturbing for me. I really couldn't like it. A beautiful little tot was abducted, raped, burned and killed. The killer was never apprehended. This well written story, begins 20 years later, set in the same town as the child's abduction and murder. Actually, the rapist/murderer is still residing there. Currently, there's a serial killer on the loose. People are being killed and all of the victims had some involvement in the murdered child's life. That is the connecting link. It's a very suspenseful book with twist and turns. In the end, when the current killer is revealed; you are left feeling how understandably sad....and yes, the child killer is finally caught, too. He's so extremely pathetic. I wanted to off him myself."
1,The kind of analysis to be expected from a social worker.,"I agree that ""The statistics that are presented are facts that will spark conversations because many of the unbelievable stats."" The vast majority of the statistics are unbelievable, either because of negligence in their calculation, or problems with invalid inferences from them.Blau's personal bias's plague the text, and render it as useful and believable as a textbook from the U.S.S.R., although because of the well known publisher a lot of otherwise educated people with average data analysis skills might be tempted to overlook some obvious errors. That would be a grave mistake.Social workers play an important role in our society- increasing the efficiency of those who have suffered some kind of trauma (those who have witnessed murders, or been raped, for instance). However- this book highlights the need for increased scrutiny of claims by those who lack training in the areas they write on."
1,Pump is not nearly as powerful as claimed,"Who knew? The manufacturer is claiming much more pumping capability than this unit can deliver. Make sure you're getting the performance you need, especially from a system that is supposed to save you in case of power failure. Know what you are getting ahead of time and don't be fooled by dishonest companies."
3,Good System,"I purchased mine in Nov 2009. It is now Dec 2012. 3 Years later. I have no complaints about this and I have the SAME battery. When the power goes off this does pump the water out. I would recommend this to a friend. I have a small generator I can start, but what if I am not home, that is why this is handy to have. I would buy this again."
1,Not helping me sleep at night,"A few months after I bought this system our power went out and and it ran during a storm, but now the battery won't seem to charge. Their customer support has been really poor - won't acknowledge it isn't working and can't seem to get them to honor the warranty. Should have gottten a water-powered pump or a more reliable system, as it is right now I don't trust it."
1,This product is garbage,"Junk, junk, junk. Don't waste your money on this. After spending over $250 (pump, battery, acid) the alarm sounded monthly for ""add water"", ""terminal corroded"", ""replace battery"". The company does not stand behind their product. As for the 7 year warranty good luck getting some to honor it."
2,Poor customer service and poor product,"I have had a unit for around 3 years.I am on my second control unit and I need another. The 2nd one is supposed to have a mute switch, which doesn't work.I have had pretty good luck with my batteries. I bought a second battery when the first unit went south.The unit does not pump much, so if you lose power, let's hope it is a small storm. I can only hope and pray it would be enough if I really needed it to come through.I still keep a generator around to use in the event of power failure. Of course, I have to be home when it happens. I plan to look into the water based pumps."
2,works good but buy the bigger battery,"I have had this sump pump for 4 years with no problems until the battery ran out during a recent storm. It won't recharge now and I need a new battery. Since this happened with no warning I am a little unhappy. The battery did not last the advertised 5-7 years and I am dreading buying a new battery since you have to add the acid yourself which is messy and dangerous. Plus, they give you so much acid that I used up many boxes of baking soda to neutralize it so I good throw it away."
2,"The Bangles ""Manic Monday"" rip-off!","She has an ok voice, but I've heard better. This song could've had a chance for hit potential if it wasn't for the fact that the verses in this song are completely ripped off The Bangles' hit ""Manic Monday"", hence two stars for this song. The Graham Stack remix is nice though."
4,Having two Bernese Mountain Dogs and a new litter of 9 I,"agree with other reviews in that this book is comprehensive and covers everything from breeding, welping, puppy care, purchase care, showing, qualifications, care and best of all it shows off the beauty and temperment of this rare and wonderful breed."
5,I think it's a GREAT book for people who want a Bernese.,"It then agian doesn't help you. If you want to know more about this breed then I would read the book for more info on the breed.My big sister does not want one, but I do so I read this book and got more info on the breed. Now I am 100% that I want one. I LOVE the back cover it is a picture of 5 cute puppys and 4 lovable puppys that want to be taken home to play with you."
3,Perhaps an interesting buy when it's on sale,"The hotel section seems OK and I didn't check out all the suggested bars, restaurants. This travel guide mainly covers mainstream stuff most people know already. If you are looking for a good condensed travel guide to the point for what's really going on in London -even up to Hip and Happening- I suggest you buy the ""Virgin Guide"" (and buy Time Out magazine in London!). I expected a better signal to noise ratio from a Loneley Planet guide. My rating of this guide: Average."
5,Surprised,I was very surprised at the size and quality of this cookbook! I expected a booklet and got this nice book with many colored pictures to help learn to make tamales. The only thing that would be better is a video.
3,pretty good,"The 'stuffin' recipes are wonderful, as are the instructions. However, my kitchenaid won't hold 3 pounds of masa plus lard and broth....left my hobart at, well, never owned a hobart. my point is, if you have access to a commercial kitchen, you're set. or, maybe if you take the time to divide the masa recipes. I left my time somewhere too...."
3,"Good, but the definitive guide is yet to be written","This is a nice little book with lots of traditional recipes and the author is enthusiastic but her fat of choice is margarine, a fact I have trouble digesting, if you know what I mean."
1,Very Disappointed,I just wanted a recipe book that could help you make tamales not a Bible. It was not tamale's heaven.Lots of photography and not about the recipe. I was very disappointed.
3,"some good, some bad","I liked all the filling and suace ideas. Was very disappointed in the masa harina recipe. First, for the amount of ingrediants, not a chance it's all going to fit in my 5 qt stand mixer, second the proportions of liquid ingrediants to dry and so far off, I ended up adding at least 2 more, if not 3 more cups of water.I did like the discussion and diagrams of all the different folding techniques, that is very helpful. I wasn't impressed that she provides a recipe for masa harina masa and then calls for fresh masa in all the tamale recipes. I've always used masa harina masa for my tamales since fresh masa is not easy to find. Would have been nice if she talked a bit more about using masa harina masa as a substitue for fresh masa.Overall, an ok book, but could be confusing for beginer tamale makers."
3,Recipe proportions not correct.,"As a vegan, I was really excited to see a tamale book that includes not only a recipe for vegan masa, but also vegan fillings. I had never made, or even eaten, tamales before, but I had been dying to try them. I followed the recipe for vegan masa perfectly, but it was a runny mess. The author called for 2 cups of stock to be added to 2 1/2 pounds of the unprepared masa. Even with a long whipping with the mixer, and probably two more cups of masa added, it was still very runny. Also, not only were her proportions of ingredients for the masa incorrect, but she also called for way too much masa on every tamale. Despite my troubles, I still steamed a batch of tamales (masa oozing everywhere), and the end result was delicious, but definitely not the consistency it should have been."
4,Not by Michael Crichton!!,"If you are planning to buy this book, please be aware that this is not a novel by Michael Crichton. Crichton wrote only two Jurassic Park books, Jurassic Park and The Lost World.The Jurassic Park 3 Penguin reader serves as a companion to the movie for children of the ages of 9 to 12.The movie was made without any input from Crichton."
1,please.....,"this book is terrible, and the movie is even worse. Seems like Jurrassic Park 3 is just a scheme to attract money, and Hollywood decided to throw out a poorly directed, poorly written movie to make money. Then they decided to make a bunch of crappy mechandise such as this book. Please... you want a suspensful dinosaur book? Read the original. Where it actually has a story line."
3,Different from movie,"I read this book and it has a lot of different stuff that's not in the movie. One really dumb part is when a Pteranodon carries a raptor into the air. Another one is when Paul Kirby is trying to fight a Pteranodon. He would die fast, but he doesn't die in the book. Don't buy the book. Buy and watch the movie."
5,Crocodilian that ain't...,"One of our first real looks at the storyline of this movie in book form. Nice pictures, but be warned--it's chock full of spoilers. This movie should be really exciting, can't wait to see it!"
3,The movie is better!,"I loved JURASSIC PARK III. When I saw it in theaters opening night, I had to go out and read this book. Well, I did and I have to say that it was kind of stupid. I mean, this was geared toward younger readers. What about adults and teenagers? They should make a JURASSIC PARK III book that's suitable for adults and teenagers. This is a good story - don't get me wrong - but the book itself seemed too childish. They should make a more difficult version of JURASSIC PARK III for the movie's adult and teenage fans to enjoy! All in all, good summer reading book for the kids. Adults and teenagers: Wait for the more difficult reading-level version to come out."
2,Not Like The Film,"I don't know about you, but I hate it when books are different from the movie, such as: Jurassic Park 3, Where The Heart Is, ect., but most of the time it's the book that's better, not this time, the movie is 3 stars better than the book. Go see Jurassic Park 3, Now Playing everywhere"
2,A poorly written novelization of the upcoming movie.,"I usually don't read children's movie novelizations anymore (after all, I'm 16), but there wasn't an adult version, so I picked up this one. I'm sad to say I was very disappointed. The story was exciting, and I think it will make a good movie. But the author didn't do a good job describing the action scenes, in fact he did such a bad job I couldn't figure out what was going on. I'm sure the kids this book was meant for will be even more confused. I was rather surprised at how badly this book was written, because I read the author's original novel Survivor, a prequel to the film, and I loved it. It's really not worth reading this book. Just wait for the movie to be released in theaters."
4,"Very, very impressive!","Just from reading this book I can get the plot and it was very helpful. Great colour pictures, and a good size too I think it is gonna be a great kid's book. But warning for those who want to keep the movie a surprise: it has tons of spoilers!"
2,"somewhat cute, but not that practical",I ended up taking this back and getting a sage green Graco diaper bag. The pink was a little obnoxious to me once I got it home and looked at it. Plus it is a little flimsy.
3,"Pretty Bag, but Not Practical","I purchased this diaper bag a few months ago because I loved the fabric and the patterns. I have two babies (under two) so I need to pack a significant amount of ""stuff"" even for short trips. Unfortunately it just doesn't fit everything we need for a whole day out. I actually have tried washing and drying it (I spilled formula inside) and it held up pretty well, not much shrinkage, it just lost it's shape a little.Overall, I think this is a lovely diaper bag and it would be great for one baby's worth of stuff."
5,As good as the film!,"I purchased this book, randomly. I did not know if it was actually based on the classic 1933 film, or what. As it turns out, this is a rewrite of Merian C. Cooper's original novel, which was written the year before the movie came out. Yeah, I never knew that either. Anyway, it's equally as interesting as the actual film so, if you liked the movie, you need to read this book. I highly recommend it to all adventure novel lovers!"
3,Crewelwork designs,"I found ""Early American Crewel Design"" to be a very good pictorial resource. It did not contain a lot about the history of crewelwork, or any references for the sources of the various designs for history buffs or reenactors. But, if you are looking for inspiration or traditional American designs, this is a good basic design book."
2,UNBIASED?? THE AUTHOR SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF HIMSELF!!,"THIS IS AN UNADULTERATED PUFF PIECE THAT EITHER HIDES, OBSCURES, IGNORES OR COMPLETELY FABRICATES A NEW HISTORY & PERSONA FOR GEORGE W. BUSH!PLAIN & SIMPLE...THIS BOOK IS A JOKE...AND A COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME & MONEY (WHICH I'D LOVE TO GET BACK PLEASE!)!!"
2,Entertaining but BIASED!,"I bought this book on a lark thinking it might actually be what the cover notes said is was ""unbiased"", but as soon as I saw Dan Rather's opinion on the book (printed on the back of the paperback I purchased), I should've known this book was not necessarily ""the truth"" on George W. Bush. Don't believe everything you read or hear from anyone in print or media. I encourage you to be selective and present things in context. . .Speaking of things in context, I really can't trust this book as gospel because Minutaglio quotes sources in such a sporadic way, footnoting the quotes only to look more credible. The quotes are sometimes ridiculous and misplaced, it seems, but albeit, very entertaining.That's just it, this book is entertaining and nothing more except to provide a biased peek at what Minutaglio believes is the driving force and reasons for our President's personality, politics, career choices, and other personal decisions.Juicy. As in gossipy."
4,Dubya,"I thought the book was fairly well-written. There were many details about Dubya that I was unaware of, despite reading 4 other books about G.W. Bush.Some of the widely known details were given a different perspective and I formed a better opinion of this president. Well worth the time and effort to read!"
3,You are getting what you pay for.,"It isn't terrible quality, but don't think you are getting and amazing ring. Works good for a back up or a cheap replacement."
1,DO NOT BUY COMPLETE GARBAGE,"Ok, so i bought this ring a while back and as soon as I got it was just not what i expected, the sides cut into your finger and the sizing is completly off the ring runs kinda big. That and wihin a week the finish had rubbed off. Please dont waste your money go with a tungsten carbide ring much much nicer."
3,good if you don't work with your hands,"I bought this for my husband to replace the wedding band he lost. The color is nice and it is a good, sturdy material. HOWEVER, hubby is a mechanic and even though takes it off while working, just having oil and dirt, etc on his hand has caused the color to start to fade, and the ring is taking on a tarnished look, as well as some scratches from him doing PT."
3,Looks nice but scratches easily.,"I bought this ring for my soon to be husband for his wedding band. He wanted something different like carbon fiber but he has very large fingers and most rings don't come on his size. The ring arrived and I was very pleased with the appearance however it did scratch fairly quickly, within a month. The scratches were small and not that noticeable. Nice enough for the money but you couldn't wear it every day."
5,Totally satisfied!,"The ring is exactly what we hoped it would be in size, appearance, and quality. Fast shipping, too. Thanks."
2,Picture looks better,"When I purchased this ring I read the reviews.The picture looks better than when you actually see it for yourself.I have this ring for over 2months now and the black is coming off.I have not recieved any comments on my ring from anyone and to me it looks plastic.Now it looks plastic to me but its not.I would say for a woman noway and for a man,maybe.The main flaw is like I said the black finish is already coming off."
2,"""Satin finish"" is terrible","The satin finish wore of after I wore it a few times. should of taken it off when I worked around the house. It got chipped up pretty bad, not very durable."
3,Sturdy ring,Good sturdy ring but the black scratched off easily. Within months it was more of a dingy gray than black ring.
3,its okay,Sweet design. Love the red and black paisley. The only unfortunate flaw is that the fabric is very cheap.
3,"Good pattern, bad cloth","This is a great black and red pattern. Everyone loves this bandanna's sweet pattern. Unfortunately the fabric is rough, thin, and crappy. It's also very cheap. Rock on with this bandanna, and become a true hero."
2,Bright Color but Wrong Size,The colors are great and it held up well in the was but I ordered 27x27 and got something smaller. No time to contact seller due to travel schedule.
4,It Will Work,"I like the pattern. As others have mentioned, not the greatest fabric. But it has been working out fine as a headband and it held up well in the first wash. Wish there were some more colors to choose from."
2,intro phil students,"This is a very very very hard read compared to the Plato Republic, no doubt about it. A lot harder to follow and word meanings are slightly shifted from Plato's. I highly recommend sticking with the Plato one's if you can since those are easier reads."
1,Unreadable,"Unreadable. A curiosity. A long way from English. The difficult made impossible. Many sentences, long and short, like, ""So let these things have been spoken of just this much."" Page 9. The footnotes are somewhat clearer than the text."
4,Contains Some of Wideman's Best Short Stories,"Even if you don't read the rest of the Homewood Books, this collection stands up strong on its own. Stories such as ""Damballah,"" ""Daddy Garbage,"" and ""The Caterpillar Story"" are engaging although they are only a few pages long. The stoies are diverse, but they fit together to form an understanding of how a community survives through poverty and alienation. Some of the best stories in this collection are the touching ""Daddy Garbage,"" the spirited ""Love Songs of Reba Love Jackson,"" and the realistic ""Rashad."""
1,expired,"oredered some, the ones i got were past date and stale, some packages were open. so not gonna buy food from here again"
2,Bland and dry!,"These little cheese-curl-like things have barely ANY flavor, cheddar or otherwise. And they are VERY dry. I bought a six-pack at the grocery store, but will donate most of the bags to my office's lunch room. Bleh."
4,Kids Love Pirate Booty!,My kids like Pirate Booty a lot. It is a great snack for lunches but I find that you limit the serving to about 1 sandwich sized Ziploc bag which is about right for a school lunch. I would also point out that they don't like the consistency of it as much as Veggie Booty which is really their all-time favorite.
3,Good...not Great...,"These are pretty good... better than a lot of the other snacky foods out there. My friend suggested coating them with white chocolate and making ""snowman poop""...I bet that would be yummy! If your trying to cut down on how much junk you eat then these are a good alternative. Nice light flavor but honestly doesn't fill you up."
5,Can't get enough,My kids can't get enough of this stuff so we keep it on the Subscribe and Save rotation. I like it too. Its a great alternative to popcorn. Soft enough for my 16-month old to eat who doesn't quite have all his teeth yet. And it's fairly healthy so i feel good letting them snack on it. But beware I can't let my son so much as see the bag unless i'm going to give him some. He will freak out.
2,Best Tasting Packing Peanuts Out There,"Okay: I haven't ever actually tasted packing peanuts. But I would be willing to bet that they taste and share the same texture that these grub-shaped extrusions do.I can't believe how popular these are, actually. I'm not a particularly picky eater. I will even eat rice cakes, which are pretty Styrofoamy. But these are really unpleasant.The ""flavor"" is a combination of something synthetic and inedible, with occasional hints of stale cornmeal, combined with a faint moldy cheese taste. The bizarre texture triggers an instinctive ""don't eat this--it isn't food"" response. The individual bits look disconcertingly similar to those large, ""C"" shaped June beetle grubs one occasionally digs up in the garden. I bet those taste better. This product fails on any aspect of ""appeal"" on every point.If you find these tasty, I'm betting you are either (a) high; (b) drunk; or (c) 7 years old and the only other thing you eat is bologna. I kid; I kid. :)"
4,Oh Dear!,"My Grandson takes a 1oz. bag of Pirates Booty each day for lunch in school.Today he came home ""Grossed out"" his words , because there was "" a dark brown, hard as a rock, chunk of something"" in his bag.My explanation was that probably a piece of Booty got caught in a machine, overcooked and the came loose and fell in his bag.Would appreciate it if you have another or better explanation. He is a picky eater at best. Would be a shame to lose a reasonably healthy snack.You need another 'contact us' method. Did not want to make this a review but could not find another way. Usually he and his sister love your products."
2,Not delicious,"I bought a 2 x 10 oz. pack from [...]. Threw the second bag out because it simply doesn't taste good. The caramel booty is recommended, but not this."
2,sponge bob???,"I bought these individual size bags of pirate's booty for my 4 year olds pirate themed birthday party. They arrived in perfect condition, perfect size, etc. However...they have a giant picture of Sponge Bob on the front of the package. This is NOT how they are pictured on Amazon. We do NOT let our kids watch Sponge Bob. Now I have all of these bags of snacks emblazoned with a character we do not endorse. I of course did not discover this until the night before the party. Thanks a lot for a lot of trouble. Send what you sell in the picture!!!"
1,Beware of this product - NOT VEGAN,"This may be a fine product, but Amazon included it in a Vegan product email to me.Cheese is not vegan."
3,Better Before,"I was not as pleased as I have been in the past. The product didn't taste as fresh and there were many pieces that had hard parts like popcorn that hasn't been ""popped"" correctly. Oddly enough, they have raised the price but lowered the quality!"
4,Tastes Great!,"My kids love this white cheddar snack, but it isn't always easy to find in our shopping area. This wasn't cheap, but we are happy that we can order Pirate Booty through Amazon. The 1 oz. bags are the perfect size for their school lunches. The taste is cheesy and light...love 'em."
2,haven't used just yet,I have recently just purchased this book and however am unable to rate it as it mostly applies to dissections in the lab. Since it's the end of the semester I'm hoping that next year it will come in handy. I've had class mates comment and say how useful it has been prior in the year so hopefully I have the same success.
2,First Year Vet Student,"This book has excellent pictures, but the text could cure insomnia. While its useful to have some guidelines as to where to cut when if this is your first time in anatomy lab, you might be better off letting your lab partners buy this one and getting a bigger and better reference book instead. I highly recommend the entertaining anatomy books from Sudz publishing by Chris Pasquini."
4,Awesomely helpful!,I would definitely recommend this book to anyone in vet school or needing an in-depth anatomy lesson. My favorite thing about it is the color drawings as well as the condensed descriptions. Way easier to read and understand than the Miller's and easier to tote to and from lab as well.
4,Nice companion for Miller's Anatomy of the Dog,"Overall, I found this to be an excellent book for small animal (technically dog only) gross anatomy. I say small animal, but I find myself referring to this text even when studying large animal anatomy. Reason--I like how the text very clearly indicates proximal and distal muscle attachments for all major muscles and specific nervous and arterial supply to all major muscles.The pictures and diagrams are decent, but all in black and white. I found it helpful to color in structures in the book as I dissected that specific part of the animal.I didn't find the text as boring as other reviewers have. True, the subject matter is tedious, but this book gets right to the point. Paradoxally, that is also while I gave this book 4 stars instead of 5. A lot of the detail is missing. I suggest having a copy of Miller's Anatomy of the Dog to go with this dissection guide.Highly recommended!"
5,Simply Majestic,"Maurizio Pollini shines in this majestic recording of the concerto. I consider this work to be one of Brahms finest and own many recordings of it. However, I have found that the sound and quality of this recording beats ALL of them. This recording is highly recommended to all music lovers. This recording should be one of the cornerstones of anybody's music collection."
5,Not even a single misstep,"It's hard to imagine a more perfect balance of soloist/conductor temperaments than Pollini and Abbado manage here. There's really nothing that goes even momentarily wrong in this live recording. Unfortunately, if you buy the companion CD of Pollini, Abbado and the BPO performing Brahms' **First** Piano Concerto, you'll find it's a real letdown compared to this."
1,So Much for TruColor,"This movie was shot in color (using the TruColor process), but this Roan Group DVD is in black and white!"
2,DVD case says 55 minutes!,"I ordered the DVD from Amazon. When it arrived I noticed that the DVD case, on the lower back, said 55 minutes, so I returned it unopened. It states in this web site 75 minutes. Annoyed."
1,Not for kids!,This toy is no fun! His arms and legs are hard to fit into their sockets--frustrating for mom and dad and much too hard for the kids to get them in there just right. Then the guy won't stand up without one of his legs or arms falling off. His wise cracks are loud and become annoying before you even get him out of the box. He is not my friend!
2,Don't waste your money!,"My daughter received this as a Christmas gift. The arms fall off easy and you can not get him to stand up. The eyeball is hard to move, for a child who has small hands. His hat is a big waste, it will not stay on! This is toy my daughter is going to throw in her closet and forget about."
2,not helpful,Did they even have an editor for this book? I took a class with Dr.Berg and his class was interesting but the book was not helpful nor was it well organized.
5,Their best in over a decade,"Midnight oil has always been a great band. I've been a fan since I first heard Diesel and Dust about 14 years ago. Although I love all of the albums released since Blue Sky Mining (especially breathe)I think that Capricornia The Oils best album since Blue Sky. Great, solid album. I would even recomend it to someone who doesn't know the band all that well."
2,Yee-ow,"One would've hoped that hooking up with Warne Livesy, who produced Diesel & Dust, would've done some good. Alas... it was no surprise when the band called it a day after this album. And anyone who read Beds Are Burning: The Journey can see the band was on a downward slide after Earth & Sun & Moon.The album starts off well with Golden Age and Too Much Sunshine but then just slides into generic production, generic songs... There's no flow, no energy, no tunes. As a fan of the band from the early days, it's really rather startling. Through all the stylistic changes and whatnot, I always found good songs, whether on the underrated Breathe album or among the cacophony of Redneck Wonderland. But the one word I would use to describe this album: Flat."
3,This isn't close to there best,"I have followed the Oil's since the early 80's and heard everything that they have brought out. This Album at first listen, I thought was [bad], but after a few more listen's I thought it was alright, but I was comparing all the other albums before hand. I found the album very repetative and I agree with other reviewers that the album could have been expanded more. I found a few of the songs sounded a lot like their earlier works like 'Head Injuries and 10 to 1' and maybe 'Blue Sky Mine' but the rest is nothing to write home about. I believe the best period of this band was 'Place without a Postcard to Diesal and Dust', Earth and Sun And Moon was a close but the rest of the other albums after this one don't rate a mention. I believe if you aren't a true Oil's fan don't bother buying it, give it a listen to by all means, there might be something that you like."
4,Capricornia,"I'm telling you, you just can't shake some of the melodies on this new album. I've had the chorus to track number 8 buzzing through my head for two days now. Have they been away too long? The answer is an unequivocal yes!"
4,LIQUIDATED,"In one of the great travesties of Rock and Roll, Midnight Oil makes a great comeback record, and yet have their career destroyed by a bumbling, incompetent record label, Liquid 8. To call these swine ... is a vast understatement. The Oils are gone now,we shall hear their like no more, give thanks to Mr. Michael Catain, fatheaded, fatbellied, just plain fat CEO of ""Liquid 8.""Tar and feathers, anyone?"
4,Music and Politics is this Mix,"There is a group called ""The Beautiful South"" that makes great music but unfortunately you can't play it in polite company because the lyrics are x-rated, filthy and downright disgusting. Midnight Oil makes great music mixed with lyrics that are not filthy or disgusting, just dumb. O'well, the music is great. Wish somebody would invent a CD Recorder that would copy the instrumental part and eliminate the lyrics."
4,Midnight Oil as we love them!,"I agree with all the other reviewers in that this is a fine return to form for the band-- back to the ""Diesel and Dust"" and ""Blue Sky Mining"" days. Somehow I missed this CD when it came out but luckily I caught it and really enjoy it. My favorite is ""World That I See"" but really the entire CD is filled with what you would expect for a band returning with all the trademarks that propelled them into the spotlight way back when (I remember seeing them in concert in L.A. in 1988; X opened for them!). It is too bad that this is the end for them but they have left a great legacy of principled, righteous rock."
2,Battered Woman Syndrome,"This book is an attempt by the author to update her earlier book ""The Battered Woman"". That book was ground-breaking by describing histories of patients in the 1970's - 1980's before the term ""battered woman"" was generally accepted. I read the older book first, started this new book and only got 1/3 of the way. Much of the information was too similar to the first book. Also, this book seemed written more 'clinically and dry' than her first book. I would recommend you only read one of these books. When I get through this second one, I will write back and update. But as of now, I would recommend her first book."
5,"Awesome music, angelic voice","This is even better than her first album, 'How to Steal the World'. Pure aural pleasure. If you like Bjork, Keli Ali or Portishead then place a chance on this!"
5,More than meets the eye,I wish this movie was more available in the US!!! I probably watched it 20 times when living in Dublin. The humor's great and there's references to all sorts of classic movies if you know what you're looking for. DEFINITELY worth watching over...and over...and over again.
5,well worth reading,"This book is profound. I bought it because I had read of Peace Pilgram and gotten a book that Cheryl Canfield had done of this incredible woman. Thus I found this book indirectly. Hesitated to get it.Am so pleased I did. Full of messages. It is like an onion. What touches me may not be what touches you, but I am sure that you will be touched. Well written. I am savoring it...reading it slowly (that is right I have not finished it yet), but I am sending copies to friends that will benefit from it."
1,The Devil is omitted from the details,"I was expecting full size coloring books (8.5X11). I am extremely dissatisfied. They are only 4.25"" X 5.5"". Too small to use for stained glass workings. Don't waste your money!"
2,ok,"This coloring book was super tiny, smaller than a post card, and I didn't realize this until it finally got to me. The pictures were pretty fun to color, though."
4,Kids love 'em. Adults love 'em.,These little books are really nice. Kids love to color them as do many adults. We used them at a holiday party and all the pages were colored. Works really well with fine tipped markers. My daughter and grown cousin both loved them as gifts.
3,TINY book,"Like other Dover Stained Glass Coloring Books on amazon, this one doesn't have ""little"" in the title but it's small -- the size of your hand."
3,Small size,"I was surprised how small this coloring book was. It is not standard size - about 1/4 the regular page size. However, if your child likes the stained glass effect, they will enjoy this book."
5,great service,The product description and condition was accurate. It was shipped and received in a timely fashion. It is being enjoyed. Thanks.
4,The essay is alive and well written,"Norton Readers have long been a staple of university literature and composition courses, which is no doubt the original purpose of this volume (hence the extended title, ""Short Essays for Composition""). If you don't let this deter you, you will be rewarded with a collection of some of the best of American essays with a plus. This is not only a collection of well written essays spanning early and modern nonfiction, but you have the bonus of modern prose stylists such as Annie Dillard and Barry Lopez talking about the pieces that are included: how they get ideas, how they craft their work, why they write in nonfiction. A satisfying and interesting collection, well worth reading and passing along to others. Great for teachers and students interested in learning about nonfiction as well, as nonfiction as a genre is the organizing schema of this volume."
4,School Book,A collection of essays assembled by type and style of writing.The book instruvts how to write common essay types by presenting the reader with a few examples of each kind. The cool part is the commentary by the authors of some of the essays as to what they were thinking when they wrote them and how they went about the writing process.Good use for an Intro to Writing college level class.
2,Did not finish,"I would not normally write a review on something I did not finish, but I felt like putting my two cents in. The book started off pretty good. I like when the main characters share a past. But I was getting kind of antsy and skimmed thru the pages. Well I came across a sex scene and I was kind of shocked. And let me tell you it takes a lot to shock me.The scene seemed so vulgar. I hate when the guy in the book thinks he can have his way with the girl, most importantly, when it comes to sex. And I hate when the girl gives in. It seems so degrading and I was not impressed.Now, I did not finish the book or even get that far, so I guess I can't make a great review. I just thought it was too much. Maybe I'll go back and read it, but for now it turned me off."
1,City Walks,"The City Walks: San Francisco: 50 Adventures on Foot is more about stores in the area than interesting landmarks.It is not a book, but 50 cards of each location. Not very informative, I would not buy another location in this series."
5,Really smart idea - I wish I had designed it myself,"My 2 favorite American cities are NYC and San Francisco. I used to spend a lot of time doing projects in California and spent every free hour in the City by the Bay. Since I have the NYC cards and love them, I figured I would buy these and have them for my next trip. A friend borrowed my set for a recent trip and told me that he followed several cards and found them a great travelling companion. In fact, he said he followed a card to the ""best view in the City."" Can't get much better than that."
2,walks aren't very interesting,"I was disappointed with this product. The format is convenient, but the walks they recommend aren't real intersting. Most of the walks are very short (usually only a few blocks) and are mostly in the touristy edges of the city. I much prefer ""Stairway Walks in San Francisco"" which has longer walks (a few miles each) and focuses more on the more diverse interior of the city."
1,Disappointment,"I have bought this 2CD set,since I was very concerned about Arabic music anddance. Unfortunately, this one is no good. Listening to it was really the most boring thing I have ever done!"
4,Excellent introductory CD for students of Mideastern rhythms,"This CD provides an excellent overview of the primary rhythms of Mideastern music. Nice sharp recordings that clearly demonstrate the individual rhythms. Hossam gives a bit of introduction on the various rhythm instruments and each rhythm's characteristics and uses. Not an in-depth course in drumming, but an excellent primer for drummers and dancers interested in learning about the primary Mideastern rhythms. I use this CD in my belly dance classes and in my beginner doumbek drum class."
4,I love this series!,"I don't think the author of these books did a bad job at all. This series of books makes me think of my own life in a way. And if anything, this series is better than the anime. If you can't purchase the uncut version, this is closer to enjoy than the dubbed version because this series also includes the japanese episodes.First episode:Helen Lambert{Usagi's home economics teacher} and a bunch of other woman who plan on getting married enter a contest. But what happens whn Miss Lambert gets controlled by the negaverse? Who will win the contest? Read this book and find out.Second episode:Peter Fisher, a classmate at Usagi's school, gets cntrolled by Nephilite. He hostes a modeling contest.Third episode:Nephilite brainwashes Mika, Sammy's ""girlfriend"" and she becomes obsessed with making dolls."
1,Sailor *twitch* scout?,"I bought this book only because it was inexpensive. They change everything even WORSE than DiC did. Last time I checked, 'Darien' did not pull 'Serena' over and tell her not to go to the modeling competition. I read these books before I saw the DiC version, and when I saw the ... dubbed episodes, I realized just how badly Usagi-chan got mutliated. They do look nice on my bookshelf, though..."
1,2 CD's mostly short edit versions,Save your money! Purchased primarily for Jock Hattle - hard to get... less than 3 minutes long... buy another compilation!
5,Excellent first hand account,"Excellent book in a series of four written by Burgett. Seldom does an author who was as young as Burgett was during the war, write so vividly and clearly. I have enjoyed all four of his books and recommend them all highly."
5,HOT CD!,"He sounds a lil like Eminem, but better. Dude's sick, funny as hell too. Beats are banging and dawg is so raw when he breaks it off. Chicago finally has an artist to look out for. Heard him freestyle on the radio the other night and he killed it. Props to Mic One."
3,Slightly overpriced considering quality,If you don't view this figure up close then it is very nice. The face and eyes are as good as most of the figures I have seen. The painting on the body was somewhat sloppy in some areas and the figure would not fit on it's base due to warping of the legs and improper fit. Some touch up's along with a new custom base and the figure will be nice but maybe not worth full price. This figure would be a good kit to work on.
3,Good quality recording but arguable selection,"I'm afraid I cannot rate this CD with more than 3 stars because although the recording quality of this edition is quite good by nowadays standards, the selection of the music does not reflect its title. I was expecting more ""well known"" tunes, more classical styles represented."
4,bad deal,Discovery Channel Store was selling this same product for $24 !!!The product itself is awesome though. Great variety of slides.
4,Hard to collapse!,"It is a really nice stroller, but difficult to collapse and reopen. The basket does not hold enough and I am actually having the manufacturer look at the mechanism because it does not stay open and latched on one side. But it is a very comfortable stroller for my daughter. She has been in it since she was born. She is 8 months old now. I hope it is fixable!"
5,LOVE THIS STROLLER,"For $269 it's well owrth the money!! I was originally looking into purchasing the Venezia in sable but they ran out of it at Babies R Us, I guess it was discontinued for the 2004 Venezia S.A coming out. When I went back they only had it in Chesapeake, I needed the Sable color. So, I purchased the Pliko P3 because I couldnt wait to take my baby for a stroll, I'm glad I did . Personally, I think the Pliko is better than the Venezia, It's an umbrella stroller the only difference is the other one was a fullsize stroller with extra feature but who cares, this is good.. I love it and looks stylish with the matching carseat!! Trust me whenever I go anywhere I'm the envy of all since most people or everyone I've seen like to sport the cheap Graco one that looks real cheap and is made in China.. This one is made in Italy and the fabric is awesome, it's true what they say, it is the Cadillac of all strollers.. The price is not a big deal.. You get what you pay for."
1,not worth the money,"buyers beware, this stroller has too many mobile parts, therefore it its parts become loose with frequent use.However, f you still like peg perego, try the aria stroller...it works wonders."
5,I think its the best stroller in the world,I have been using the Pliko for 10 months now. I have to admit that its been so useful from the day my baby was born. The carseat clicks on to it that way your baby faces you. It reclines all the way down so the baby can sleep in it. One of the best features about this stroller is the way it folds. I find it so easy and so much lighter than the strollers me and my husband have tried out. It also folds like an umbrella where most strollers with these features would fold in a bulky and wide way. It can fit confortably in any car and doesnt take much space. Its also freestanding!! In the UK the majority of people with babies have this stroller. I have to admit it is a bit expensive but really you are paying for something that is very well made and has very useful features. I am very happy with it and think its worth every penny.
5,Heather-new mom,"I have a Graco travel system that I used with the infant seat & latch, but after my 7 month old daughter grew out of the infant seat & I was just using the carriage, I found it very heavy to put in & out of the car (and took up most of the trunk in my SUV!) and very hard to use in the malls & for our walks. I wanted something light weight and easy to fold up. I found this one and both my husband & I love it! It's just what we needed! And my daughter falls asleep very easily when the back is reclined.Worth every penny!"
2,"A bit, well, frustrating...","For the money, this stroller is pretty awful:-SO incredibly hard to open and close-VERY hard to steer in the wheel-locked and unlocked positions-Parts seem loose, ricketyI thought quality came with this name, but I can't tell you how much I'm cursing this stroller every time I use it. More often than not, I get out my Baby Jogger or $15 umbrella stroller instead of the Pliko."
2,Save your money and buy something else!,"We bought this stroller with our first child, of course wanting the best... what a joke! It was not what we expected at all. The sunshade doesn't cover much at all (same with the carseat!), the seat doesn't even recline all the way back (something even Graco offers in every stroller!), and it is impossibly hard to open and close (I had to use both hands, which can be difficult at times with a baby!). You would think for the money that this would be an easy and convenient stroller, it is niether! We sold ours and bought the Graco safari set instead, we love it and now even use it for our second child! I gave it two stars because it looks good... but looks can only get you so far!"
3,Don't Expect much from Cust Service,"I have this stroller and while I like it alot it does have a few problems. The Cup Holder is cheaply made, but not inexpensive if it breaks it is twenty dollars to replace. I think it was more of an after thought then in the original design and it is too small - who wants to stroll around with an open can of soda splashing every thing, but that is all it will fit. Next after a month of use the basket becomes unusable as it is cheaply made and small plastic tubing starts to pop through the seam. Yuck. Well I thought Customer Service would take care of it - Nope I got a very nasty woman who said they would wave shipping charges, but that the item was twenty six dollars - I said NO WAY. Get real people the basket isn't worth that much, maybe ten at most for a flimsy piece of material. Also that foot rest - watch out it flips backward - I have had that happen 3 times with the baby almost hitting her head."
1,Below 1 star!,We bought this stroller thinking that it was the best. Warning: Warranty only lasts a year! My stroller began having problems unfolding within 6 months and now is unusable at 13 months. It will no longer unfold. I guess more $$$ is not always better.
5,recomand highly,Bought for 2 3yrs old and 1 4 yr old for christmashad before when my kids were young and now its the grand kids and a grandchilds turn
3,Looks like fun,Ive read many reviews on this product and i agree with most people on this. the fun factor is awesome but durability sucks. i was mostly happy with the design however and have even as an inventor decided im gonna improve the design a bit. not for profit but for fun. im thinking of building it more durable and in multiple sizes for kids ages 2 thru adults since i read many reviews of adults wishing they could fit. perhaps one day i will have my product on here for jealous adults lol
4,Good fun even for a four year old.,"We bought this for our four year old grandson for Xmas. He has only used it one day so he hasn't gotten the coordination down pat yet but he really enjoyed playing with it. It will do great in developing his coordination and strength of both arms. It is very apparent which arm is stonger as the car turns more in that direction. The only problem I can see is that when he ran off the concrete onto a gravel driveway, the gravel really started cutting into the wheels. We had to make a ""no off the driveway"" rule or it wouldn't last more than a few weeks."
4,"Uchida great, ECO fine, Tate pedestrian","The review title says it all. For my taste, few pianists are as attuned to Mozart as Uchida. I do not hear whatever it is that her detractors call ""fussy."" To me she is thoughtful, sensitive, nuanced, and joyful, expressing the full range of Mozart's delights. If her accompaniment were her equal, this would be THE set of choice. Tate's a bit too conventional and workmanlike for my tastes, however, and therefore this complete cycle takes a back seat to SchiffMozart: Piano Concertos [Australia] and BuchbinderMozart: The Piano Concertos [Box Set] as far as I'm concerned."
5,Uplifting! Inspiring!,"Awesome performance and compositions. Bravi, to Mozart, Mitsuko Uchida, and the other musicians taking part in this recording. Listen and be uplifted to a higher plane..."
3,"3 stars, but She's Great","A wonderful performance by Mitsuko Uchida is marred by very poor sound engineering. If there were longer samples on the Amazon site which included more piano, instead of just the random sound bites, I would not have purchased the CDs. It's a shame that greater attention wasn't given to overall sound including the muffled piano. Seems as if the brightness is filtered out. Why did they make the sound so dull? The Mozart: Piano Concertos (Complete), Vol. 1 and 2, with Jenö Jandó are fantastic and are why I want to hear other interpretations. Don't know what they where thinking but it is what it is. Nevertheless, I will enjoy Uchida's great talent."
3,Mozart: The Piano Concertos,These DVDS offer excellent listening opportunities and I loved them EXCEPT for the fact that one of the DVD's was damaged. I was very annoyed with this but loved the rest of the set that I did not bother to send it back. Luckily the disk damaged was not an important part of the concerto series or otherwise the whole thing would have been returned. That the is problem with ordering unseen products on the internet...you never know what you are getting.
1,Book is useless without the software,I ordered this book and it did not come with the software. This book is USELESS without the software.
2,Major Design Flaw,"The designer of this rack did not plan to catch the drain from the utensil holder. The utensil holder is hung outside the drain tray, leaving your counter top right underneath the dripping utensils."
2,good idea ...but design not executed right,The problem is when the utensil basket is attached onto the rack's end the drain board is no longer large enough to catch the water--so--- the water drips onto the counter top. I have had to place a kitchen towel under the utensil basket to soak up any water that drips. I am so unhappy about this design flaw and quite surprised that this was not resolved before it went into reproduction let alone the great reviews that Simple Life magazine gave it.I paid too much to toss it so i am living with the towel & making do.
4,water wiggler review,"We've bought two of these wigglers. They work well keeping the birdbaths cleaner. It takes a little while for the birds to adapt. The negative is that you have to replace the two ""D"" batteries every couple of months."
2,"Wire detached, seal broke, Poor Customer Service","I only had this product for a few months before it broke. I thought it was a battery issue since it stopped working one morning. I replaced the batteries....nothing happened. Finally I unscrewed the top. The wires were frayed and one set was detached. After repeated attempts to keep the wires in place, we gave up. The seal was also broke, so water could seep into the battery pack after that. I contacted the company since it was a craftmanship problem with the wires. They didn't respond. I would not recommend this product. The birds avoided the bath when the wiggler was running anyway...."
2,so-so,"This works OK. If something falls into the birdbath, though, it gets stuck in the wiggler and the wiggler stops working until you remove the material."
4,Long legs but works well,"This is the second of these water wigglers that I've owned. The first one lasted several years and worked well to keep the water moving in my relatively shallow bird bath. Unfortunately I threw the old one out. I wish I had kept the metal legs because the new ones (about 3.5 inches) make the unit sit higher, which means I have to refill the bird bath more often to keep the rotating part under water. Mechanically, however, it works fine and is easy to assemble. The birds seem to like the movement and it keeps the water from becoming a stagnant nursery for mosquitoes. I'm going to ask my husband to either bend the legs or shorten them."
4,water wiggler,Have received this product and it appears exactly as it was advertised. Have not had a chance to use it yet but will definitely share results.
4,Water Wiggler,"The wiggler is easy to assemble. It ""stirs"" the water in the bird bath as described and seems to stay in place even with winds in the 20-25 mph range. I haven't noticed any birds drinking from the fountain since it was placed there; but the primary reason for using it is to discourage mosquitoes from laying eggs."
4,Works great,The wiggler works great. The water doesn't freeze..it entertains the squirrels too. They are fascinated by it! It is also easy to assemble.
1,water wiggler,"recieved merchandise and it was as reported. only problem is, for us, it ran the birds off. now it sits beside my sink, waiting on another idea for its use. sorry. not such a good product."
4,wiggler,This is very effective in keeping the water moving so mosquitoes would not be a problem. Also it is quick and easy to put together and the birds love it...
2,"Great when it works - otherwise an expensive, short-lived gadget","When it works, it's great. We have a deep birdbath, so I sat ours on a brick in the birdbath. When it ran, it worked great and kept our water clear and seemed to attract more birds. After only a month, our first one quit working and we exchanged it at the local retailer where we purchased it. About a year later, our second unit has already quit working. I've seen several other reviewers who indicated theirs didn't last long as well. For $30, it should definitely last longer. Considering the issues I've had with two of these, I doubt that I'll be buying another one of these."
5,bird bath free of mosquito eggs,"I am very pleased with my water wiggler. It has been in my bird bath since first of April and is working great. Battery life - still using the same original batteries,but battery life also depends on the batteries. I wish the wiggler was a little heavier and will get a heavier one if in the future I need to get another wiggler. I have had wind gusts up to 50 mph which did not blow over the wiggler, but it is in a protected area from strong winds. No big crows or other birds have knocked the wiggler over. I have seen no mosquito eggs."
3,Works well but ad was misleading,"The way this was shown in the ad it looked like there was a solar powered light in it. Unfortunate that there is not. Otherwise, product works well."
2,Not what I thought...,"I was really excited to get this water wigler for my bird bath.But when i received it I was disappointed to find out that it was not a solar water wiggler. It only runs on battieries. There is no on/off switch, so the batteries will not last long with it running all the time. I did not want it to run at night.So I returned it for a full refund. I don't blame the company, it just wasn't what I expected. It is a good product, just not what I wanted.API 4WW Water Wiggler Water Agitator for Bird Baths"
1,Piece of junk!!!,I used it for about a month and the new batteries died! I thought this was supposed to last at least a couple months!
2,Scary water,"The water wiggler performed exactly as advertised. However, it scared the birds away. They flew close to the birdbath and immediately flew away. Very disappointing."
2,third one and last one,This was the third one I purchased as my other two just stopped working after 2 seasons. This one didn't even last this season. not wasting any more money on these things.
3,I have a better solution for you.,"First, let me say that this is a good book, BUT, it is too expensive. A better solution is to buy the video version (same title)which costs only $29.95! I also recommend the video because some of the exercises are harder to visualize by reading the book where as the video does a better job at explaining the movements. Keep in mind the following points though; 1. These exercises are more advanced than many other regular abdominal exercises. 2. There is only about 30 minutes of info on the video... half of it spent on an exercise called the Junda situp. 3. I do not agree with the author slamming other conventional abdominal exercises such as the regular crunches: even though his exercises may have advanced benefits, many strong mid-sections were built with regular exercises.My final point is... if you have to have this info, buy the video and skip the book... use the extra $5.00 (or so) to go to a nice movie."
3,very dated,"I happened to receive this as a gift recently. I doubt that anyone will be looking at this cd anytime soon, but just in case: if you're a fan of ""club jazz"", with programmed beats, weird samples, and minimal harmonic activity, this may be for you. To me it sounds like Old Navy shopping music. There is some good playing on the CD and some funky licks, but it's hard to figure out what these guys are really about. I would say that fans of Jamiroquai (spelling?) would enjoy this. If you're looking for some REAL funk, look elsewhere."
4,A Great Book for Film Noir Fans,"John Huston's ""The Maltese Falcon"" is one of the greatest movies ever made. This book from the Film Classics Library captures the whole movie - more than 1,400 blow-up photos shown sequentially and coupled with every line of dialogue from the original soundtrack, allowing you to study this masterpiece practically frame by frame. The stills let you examine details that are hard to catch while watching the movie. Every student of film-making should have this book."
2,Foolish,"The art is perfectly charming. The story, on the other hand, is rather predictable.One fairly major problem I have with the story is this: One of the ""problems"" caused by Angelina's love of ballet is that ""she twirled and spun across the playground so fast that none of the little boys in her class could catch her, and they were all very cross,"" and when the problem is solved, ""she even let the boys catch her on the playground sometimes.""Having said that, I must add that my three-year-old adores the book and wants to hear it over and over."
5,a mom's review....,"beautifully illustrated, heartwarming childrens stories. Even though the Angelina stories are geared towards girls, my little boy, at 8, enjoyed these as well, especially when mom read to him. These are good stories to read to your child at bedtime.The artwork is detailed and delightful to look at-you'll see new things each time you look, and children love that that every scene is filled with many little mice.This Angelina story deals our hopes and dreams(in Angelina's case constant dancing)-to follow your dreams but at the same time know there is a time and place for fun, and a time to do your work. Each book is filled with wonderful life lessons told in a gentle, non preachy way.I highly recommend this series for any child.5 stars!"
3,Where's Polly?,The pictures were great and the story was okay but the only characters in the story were Angelina and her parents.
5,A lovely book,"I recently received this book at a baby shower, and I think it is such a sweet story. I have since then given my niece the same book for her to enjoy."
5,An inspiring tale,"My 2 year old daughter received this for her birthday this year and loves it! The story of Angelina, the little mouse who dreams of being a ballerina and keeps practising, to the exclusion of all else is something that strikes a chord in any one who has had a serious interest in something, be it dance, sports, etc. I would say that this book is not just for aspiring ballerinas, but for any child that is keen on pursuing an interest seriously. And I love the fact that towards the end, Angelina's parents take her passion for dancing seriously, and buy her a tu-tu & sign her up for classes...it gives hope to a child and that is absolutely priceless. A wonderful, inspiring tale of dreams that turn into reality. The illustrations are a delight too!"
4,Oliver Twist. wow,"This book contains everything, mystery, love story, suspense, it has it all. It is like reading a modern thriller without all the filthy language, wich I hate."
5,Akamatsu-san does it again.,"If you've been following the Negima! series, then you won't be disappointed by this book. Negi becomes the student of two of his students. K Fei's teaching mode is very cute, and Dark Evangeline's test is quite dramatic. The class president taking Negi out scene is very hillarious, as it shows the best-laid plans of mice and men oft go awry. The ending is very heartwarming and promising.Please be warned that there are several adult situations here. I don't recommend it for little kids (under 13.)"
5,Bring it home.,"This is the seventh volume in this ""harem"" manga series. Negi and his students are back from their field trip. Negi decides he wants to be able to defend himself better, so he begins martial arts training with Ku Fei and magic training with Evangeline. More of his students find out he is a wizard and hilarity ensues. Negi and his students also take a vacation to a South Pacific island, which is a good excuse to show the girls in swimsuits. If you enjoyed the previous volumes in this series, you will also enjoy this one."

4,Thunder Tiger Prop Shaft Assembly Outboard - PN 0107,"The Prop Shaft was hard to find locally. Not a problem for Amazon.com, priced moderately and shipped quickly."
5,So like the effect of a Greek tragedy.,"This novel engenders ""fear and pity"" in the way that a Greek tragedy intends. The dual protagonists march towards their fates with irony and inevitability. The romanticism that is indifferent to the obvious suffering leads to an ending that is both expected and unpredicted at the same time. I can't remember when I've been so affected by a novel."
4,Vendettalogy,"This book is one of Kadare's regional (Albanese) novels. It is the story of bloody family feuds regulated by the unwritten rules of the Kanun (an Albanese tribe law).'Broken April' is the picture of more specific (not general) human conflicts. It doesn't have the same high intensity of his political novels like the violent masterpieces 'The Pyramid', 'The Palace of Dreams' or 'The Eagle' about life, politics and the longing for freedom in a totalitarian State.I also found the mixing of the blood feud part with the visit of a writer and his wife to the Albanese Rrafsh region, as well as the brief encounter of his wife with a family feud murderer, rather artificial.The story is also partly written in a 'superlative' style.Not one of Kadare's masterpieces, but, as always with this masterful author, a worth-while read."
4,Broken April,"I started reading and finished this book in one day--I've owned it for a few years but never read it, admittedly. But I picked it up yesterday and couldn't put it down.Admittedly, I was a bit shocked that this book made it to the printing presses (assuming as I am that Kadare lived in Hoxha's Albania in 1982 when this book was written). Hohxa was a Tosk and tried to stamp out all vestiges of the Kanun and the gjakmarrje (blood feud). But, in a special way, this book transcends the customary law and the Northern Albanian Alps: it tells a time-honored tale of honor, obedience to one's father, and hospitality.The metaphors used by Kadare to describe the honored role of the guest in the Albanian home are true to this day. His depiction of Albanian mannerisms, knowledge of the Kanun of Leke, and interplay of the main 3 sets of characters make for a worthwhile read."
5,Great chili from a can...,Or from scratch for that matter. The turkey is tasty. I didn't miss the beef a bit. I mix it with brown rice for an easy meal.
4,Quality product,"Hard to find, has a fair amount of turkey in it, pretty healthy, except abit high in sodium, although it doesn't taste salty per se. Appreciate that it doesn't have antiobiotics or other added to the meat."
5,Worth the search,"Obviously it's a re-paint of the ""cheerleader"" supergirl - even looks like her with different hair - but it's worth having. The articulation is a bit bad because - well having spindly arms doesn't leave you much to work with - so it's mostly a display only piece.A definite must have."
2,Less Than Semi-Funny,"In ""Semi-Pro,"" it is 1976 and the NBA-ABA merger is approaching. Jackie Moon (Will Ferrell) is the owner and a player on the Flint Tropics, a ragtag franchise that Moon hopes will be invited to join the NBA--he is told that this will happen if his team finishes in the top four in the final ABA season.The plot isn't great, and there aren't a lot of laughs here--the film does have a couple of good moments, but while the movie wouldn't quite qualify as an air ball, it is definitely a clang off the back rim. I saw this DVD for $5 in a retail store and hoped that it would be a decent hoops movie, but I guess there was a reason it was being remaindered. Will Ferrell was in an uproariously funny movie in 2008, but ""Semi-Pro"" wasn't it."
2,A Rare Miss for Will,"Will Ferrell launched a 3-pointer, and missed with Semi-Pro. The trailer for this movie actually looked great and I was very excited to see it.... but the movie was slow, and unappealing for the most part. Like all Will Ferrell movies, it had some fantastic moments. A couple of ""LOL"" moments, but overall, the movie was pretty bad. It's funny, because I hadn't seen a Will Ferrell movie I didn't like, so I watched it again 2 days later to make sure I wasn't missing something! Sadly, I liked it even less the 2nd time. :("
4,Very Funny!!!,"Ever since I saw the extremely awesome Land of the Lost movie, I have been re-watching some of Will Ferrell's movies. I saw this with 3 friends, back when I was in high school, and I think I was the only one that liked it. I love how they recreate the look and feel of the 1970's. Ferrell does an awesome job as Jackie Moon, a singer who buys a basketball team called the Flint Tropics. Only four teams will move to the NBA, and the Tropics aren't looking too good. They seek the help of Ed Monix. If they have any chance of coming in 4th place, they must work as a team, and get 2,000 fans. I highly recommend SEMI-PRO!!!"
1,AWFUL!!!,"Absolute WASTE of $$. Hubby bought it thinking it would be a good laugh. Nothing but a RAUNCHY movie. So thankful I chose to fall asleep 20 minutes into the movie. From what my husband said all I missed were countless ""f""-bombs and every other word that I would have no interest in listening to for an hour and a half. Don't waste your money. Wish Will Farrell would go back to the comedy of ""Elf""."
1,How can this movie possibly be so very very bad?,"In a movie with so many giant comic talents - Will Ferrell, Will Arnett, Andy Richter, Kristin Wiig, Woody Harrelson, etc - I was shocked to laugh ONLY ONE TIME in the whole movie. I've given a lot of thought to how this movie went so very wrong and have come up with the following:Where other, better Will Farrell movies had a plot only to serve as minimal scaffolding for zany antics, this movie stuck slavishly to the terrible cliched sports comedy story line.Jackie Moon is too sympathetic - he's an idiot, but not a total pompous ignoramus - so when he does stupid things you cringe instead of laughing. I felt a lot more pity than anything else."
2,Ferrell needs to stay inside the Apatow realm,"This film did fall very flat. It seems like Will Ferrell is only in his true element when he is involved in a Judd Apatow production, this and Blades Of Glory are examples of how he should only be involved with Apatow."
1,The worst yet,"Don't get me wrong, I love Will. However, this movie is a stinker. I held out hope it would pick up steam from the start, but was disappointed. The high point was... it does come to an end eventually. Sorry Will. Better luck next time."
1,The Worst Movie I've Ever Seen,"Let me start by saying that I love bad movies. I appreciate when a film is so unable to be taken seriously that it winds up being funny, or adds to the value of its badness.Then there are movies with huge stars, enormous budgets, and awful stories. These are movies which truly suck. Months ago I thought Spiderman 3 was the worst a movie could get, but it got on its knees and gave the cake to Semi Pro.I enjoy Will Ferrell in Old School, Night at the Roxbury, SNL, etc. But this time he has gone too far. I can't begin to explain the brainlessness of every word spoken in the film. I did not laugh once. My friend fell asleep next to me. I only decided to watch the entire thing so that I could say that it is the worst movie I've ever seen.THERE IS NOTHING REDEEMING ABOUT THIS FILMI recommend this only to people looking to regret watching it, or those looking to find their own personal new Worst Movie Ever."
3,what you'd expect,"This isn't a great movie, but it's pretty good. It's what you'd expect from Will Farrell. It's stupid, vulgar, silly, and sometimes pointless. If you've seen one of his movies in the part, you've seen this one; it just has a different title and script.If you're a Will Farrell fan, you'll enjoy this. If not, maybe not. Better than a lot of movies out there.I would recommend this if you're looking for stupid humor without a lot of social commentary or deep meaning."
2,Almost Okay,"I'm not a fan of Will Ferrell's film career. But from his days on SNL, I know there is some mediocre talent under the ego and cheap laughs.This film suffers in the same way films like ""Walk Hard"" and Apatow comedies do. The movie is full of lazy joke-writing and plenty of hammy comedians not doing anything. You'll see plenty of Mad TV, SNL and Upright Citizens members in these films and they all seem unmotivated.There are a few clever moments spread out through the movie and it has the typical ""heart-warming"" storyline kick in too late in the film. Hopefully, when these type of juvenile comedies are no longer bankable, we'll see Ferrell hungry again and centered on making us laugh, instead of trying to hard to make us like him."
3,Defintely not the best Will Ferell but still hilarious,"All you whiners giving this low ratings need to be quiet. This movie is clearly supposed to be stupid, not a smart witty comedy. It's classic Ferrell. While I do admit it isn't anywhere near as good as ""Talladega Nights"" or ""Old School"", it''s still full of good laughs. I don't see how anyone could watch this and not find it amusing. People these days are way too stuck up and expect too much when it comes to movies. I, personally, love comedies like this. They are supposed to be ridiculous and off-the-wall, and they make you feel good. If you don't like Will Ferrell, don't watch his movies. If you do like hi, then you should know what to expect."
2,So Silly,"I love Will Ferrell, but apparently can only take him in small doses. His SNL skits were hilarious, but a full length movie with him as one of the main characters? Way too much. Semi-Pro has its moments. Some of the dialogue is hysterical, but to hear similar types of backyard humor over and over gets old. This is worth watching on cable only."
5,Why the low ratings?!?!!??,"I love Will Ferrell. Ferrell and Apatow are 2 people out there redefining comedy and making sure it doesnt suck in this day in age. Ferrell usually plays the same roles in all of his movies. A Guy with an inflated ego, and usually has a nude scene. However, this is not the case although it seems like it. This movie is pretty hilarious, and the story aint bad either. YES it is rated R, but thats only in the scenes where he lashes out at the ref, which are hysterical. 3 of the scenes in this movie are classic.SPOILER ALERT:#1 The Rob Cordorry masturbation scene#2 The Jive Turkey Scene (Will Arnett is hilarious)#3 The Arguments with the refs,Oh and also when Woody Harrelsons character is traded for a washing machine cracks me up. I liked this movie and I think you will too, go buy semi-pro"
4,Love me sexy,"Will is a great comedian and proves it once again in Semi-Pro but with a few lacking aspects. The commentators are really forcing these jokes down your throat and it goes down flat. The characters are hilarious and prove to be great additions. Jackie Moon isn't as suave as Ron Burgundy or as interesting. He wasn't the focus of the story, however, which is kind of strange. The rest of the film is funny and in some instances I was crying from laughing so hard. There are two scenes where it brought the funny and was extremely awesome. The Russian Roulette scene was nerve racking and funny as hell. Semi-pro is lacking yet it can be included in the annals of classics such as Ron Burgundy, Old School, A night at the roxburry, and so on. Just watch it. Give it a shot."
1,Worst movie he ever made,This movie is really vulgar and not funny at all. I like most of his films. I didn't even want to finish it it's that bad.
1,What A Bore!,"Semi-pro is a major letdown. Nothing works in this horror ride, Expect to an extend Will Ferrell. A complete bore!"
1,Didn't laugh once,"Normally I like most of Will Ferral's movies. I LOVE Talladega Nights, Old School, Anchorman, etc. But WOW! This movie was HORRID! The plot was dumb, the jokes were old and tired, even Woody Harrelson (who I love in comedies) couldn't save this movie.Seriously, I didn't laugh ONE SINGLE TIME. At least Blades of Glory (which I thought stunk) had a couple of funny lines. This one had none."
5,EVERYBODY LOVE EVERYBODY!!!,"A must watch for basketball and Ferrell fans alike. This is such a quotable movie. I first watched it with my basketball team at an out-of-town tournament in high school and watching it (and quoting it) again and again never gets old. It's a straight-forward Will Ferrell sports movie plot, don't expect anything more than your standard comedy setups, but the moments and the characters are so funny you won't be able to help but enjoy yourself. Woody Harrelson shows once again why any movie he is in is worth watching as he takes on the role of a washed up NBA player that's been traded to his hometown ABA team....for a washing machine.Enough said."
5,Hilarious flick,"This movie is the best, funny, outrageous and pretty close to real life with regard to how the old ABA was run."
4,AN ABSOLUTE GEM!,"If you love spoofs...you'll adore this one as I do. Will Ferrell could never be unfunny. Well written and acted. Everyone in this movie is spot on! I am in the middle of watching a friends dvd right now, and ordering my own!"
2,Very bleh,"Not that funny, Will Ferrell has some hits and misses and I obviously see this as a miss. It does look VERY GOOD on Blu-Ray though!"
1,a waste of everyone's time,There are some interesting actors in this. There must be interesting people watching this that wasted their time just like me on this. I love Will Ferrell but not this thing.
2,It has its moment,"Not as funny as anyone expected. I love Will Ferrell most of his movies are fantastic, but clearly he really needed some money so he headlined this craptastic movie, it had a couple funny parts but mostly a dumbed down plot that moved slowly."
2,not good,"THis one looked like a skipper. But some one I trusted, told me it was better than Blades. HA! liar.THis movie is *NOT* a comedy. its a sports movie witha bunch of comedy thrown in. WIll Ferrels character seems like a side character that was maybe a small comedy relief part that was expanded or an add on role he created - he has nothing to with basketball and the central plot about basketball.Woody haroldson can be funny. but hes a straight boring a hole in this movie. Andre 3000 is known for his funky afronaught music personna - but unlike George CLinton - he's always been a sourpuss. he just adds sourness to this film.this film has moments but its not good."
2,Disappointing...,I had high hopes and was let down. It has its moments. Hopefully Will Ferrell will redeem himself in Step Brother...
1,"UMMM, WHAT?",AS COMPARED TO SOME OF HIS OTHER COMEDY CLASSICS...THIS IS FUNNY BUT STUPID. WILL FERRELL NEEDS TO BE A LITTLE MORE SELECTIVE.
4,LOVED IT,"I loved this movie. Although I am sure the fact that I am from Flint, MI had something to do with it. It was a funny movie, and I can't get that song, ""Love Me Sexy"" out of my head. Let's face it Will Farrell was hilarious on SNL, but most of his movies are not that great. Just 10 minutes of jokes wrapped around 80 or so minutes of filler. Compared to the rest this is just as good as far as I'm concerned, (If not better.)I'd recommend it to anyone who wanted a laugh."
5,Breastfeeding: A Guide for the Medical Profession,I am a IBCLC and work in a NICU with very small premature &/or sick newborns. As a nurse I very frequently use Dr Lawrence's book when there is a conflict with a doctor over the care of our breastfeeding babies. Dr Lawrence's book is compleatly research based and written with authority --- no touchy/feely all professional. It is a great book to use to study for the lactation exam !!! Get the newest copy date you can find -- doctors respect new information.
5,THE All-you-want-to-know Book with a medical backup,"With all those books on breastfeeding out there, you might be tempted to buy the good-old question-answer based book. But believe me you will still have the: Is this what a doctor might tell me? question back there in your head. This book, however; presents you with more complete answers that experts on the breastfeeding subject have studied. You will end up being an expert on breastfeeding yourself. Even friends call me to check a prescripted medicine on the chapter that classifies almost-all prescriptions with scales as to how they affect and enter the breastmilk. Be assured, you will be fully satisfied and, as I found myself; exceed your expectations."
2,Some Interesting Characters In A Story Going Nowhere,"Another on my list of Post Apocalyptic tales, Symphony is the first book of a four part series dealing with the four horsemen of the apocalypse. While the characters are interesting, the story is filled with subplots and tangents that just go nowhere. The writer has a penchant for placing characters in interesting situation, then leaving you to assume you know what happened. Yet, at many times, you guessing, which is not good. Grant takes an interesting course with humanizing the horseman, this time War, but this was done much better in Gaimen and Pratchett's Good Omens. Here, it basically humorless. The book's ending is ambiguous at best, and while this may be OK for some series, here it just makes you want to avoid picking up the next installment."
3,Puzzling,"In part a traditional Western with a motley band of not-so-bad outlaws and a spunky heroine, and in part a more modern take on the difficulties of being a woman in a man's world. While the hero, John Grobart, seems tailor-made for a Clint Eastwood or a John Wayne, his situation -- obsessing over his dead wife Cat Dancing while trying to deal with his plucky captive, Catherine Crocker -- is anything but a cliche. The story has some shocking twists and turns that keep you guessing at how the characters will react. The only disappointment is the ending, which lets the author off the hook in forcing both John and Catherine to choose. I enjoyed the story on the surface, but ended up puzzled by the author's intentions and whether the story had any larger meaning."
5,Moving story,"I had seen the movie and wondered how closly it followed the book. Both are good. The movie's ending is more satisfying, but the book is definitely a good read. I really enjoyed it."
2,See the movie,Terrible ending. I remembered the movie w Robert red ford and the book has been on my list for a long time. Sort of a waste of time.
5,Great academic resource,"For all practitioners looking to seek a great academic resource on developing levels of partnerships for service-learning, this is definitely your book! The wealth of information ranges from broadening your campus resources to learning how to make successful connections with your local community. For those interested in learning more about the dynamic use of theory-to-practice work in service-learning, this book is a necessity!"
5,Energy saver!,"Now I dont have to wait till the house gets comfortable, it is that way when I get there because of this amazing thermostat. Thank you."
5,Great value!,"I bought these for each of my two systems. I recognized this t-stat as being identical to the one (albeit under a different brand name) I used in a previous home for 8 years within incident. (In fact, I bought the previous t-stat from a friend who is an AC supply wholesaler and paid about the same price in 2001!) Quick shipping, easy installation, great functionality and very tough to beat for the price!"
4,Thermostat Review,"Easy to install, easy to program.I use thermostat only for air conditioning, therefore don't use auto run. Keeps preset room temperature within 1 degree. Definitely will recommend to anyone who is looking for inexpensive thermostat to have."
5,"So far, so good",It does what it's supposed to do. It is quick and easy to install.I am happy with the purchase so far.
4,easy to install and program,"with 4 set points per day, you can really customize the temperature. Ours has gone thru 1 cooling and 1 heating season and holds the temperature very accurately. Display is easy to read. Filter change reminder and energy usage record is a plus.Only thing I would like that the unit does not do is to show the actual room temperature AND the set point temp together on the display at the same time. To get the latter you have to put the up or down arrow momentarily. (maybe you can program the display to show that but if so I have not figured it out) Other than that it works very well. I have not tried the setting that automatically switches from heating to cooling. If I had to purchase again I woudl buy it. For the money it is an economical 7 day programmable unitUPDATE -Now almost 2 years down the road and unit still working great."
1,Never gets the temperature right,"We've had the new thermostat for a couple of days, and it always thinks it's 77-79 in the house and we're FREEZING! Can't get the A/C to stop running, which was the reason we got a programmable thermostat in the first place. Returning this and getting a different brand."
2,Not happy with this unit,"I bought this thermostat to replace an older programmable. Installation went fine and once I had it programmed it worked as advertised. But the interface left much to be desired. First of all, you are supposed to be able to take it off the wall to set it, but once it is in the bracket, it would not come off the wall no matter how hard I pushed on the release button. The override controls are not very intuitive, with some buttons on the outside and some on the inside. For instance to override the temperature, you can't just use the two outside buttons to set the new temperature. The inside buttons are labeled so small that they are very hard to read in a dark hallway. The worst thing is there is one button that if pushed reverts back to the default programming and you have to reprogram all over again. I replaced this unit with a new Honeywell that doesn't have any of these problems."
3,Starting to do odd things....,"I have owned this unit for about 4 years. This summer it started doing weird stuff on it's own. In the middle of the night it would start lowering the temperature to 62 F. Since I normally keep the temp around 74, it would take a long time to get to 62. The times I woke up freezing cold from the AC blowing non-stop I would find the temp setting at 62F. I can only think this is somehow related to the built in energy star settings and the unit getting confused. Anyway, I turn this thing off when I'm not home because I don't know what it will do. Probably not the best unit but recall it being cheaper than the other comparable models. I guess I've probably burned the savings off already with the late night freeze outs."
1,Defective unit,"I read the manual, followed all instructions, and got the unit installed in about 30 minutes. It worked great for a few days, turning on and off as programmed. Then it just went into permanent ""fan"" mode. I checked, double-checked and triple-checked all programming and switches, as well as trying the ""Home today"" setting, but nothing worked. The unit said it was in ""Cool"" mode but was only running the fan. I thought it might be my A/C so called a repairman, but he said the A/C was fine, the problem was the thermostat. When we uninstalled the Hunter and went to a different thermostat, sure enough, the A/C worked perfectly. I would have been open to returning the thermostat in return for a replacement, but the warranty says I'd have to pay additional shipping! So no thanks, I'm just returning it (no charge) to Amazon for a refund."
2,Mine Lasted 7 years - failed like others,"All of a sudden, my fan was running continuously. I thought it was my furnace control board because a failure of the low voltage fuse results in continuous run of the indoor blower. Replaced the furnace control board and same thing. Burned up fuse, but only during call for cooling. Heat was OK. Checked control wire and contactor/coil on outside condenser and all was A-OK!. Removed thermostat from wall and operated all with a jumper wire. It's the thermostat. Sad state of affairs on a 1986 Furnace when the part that failed was the newest addition of the Hunter thermostat in 2004. I am going back to the manual thermostat because they are simpler and I never noticed any savings with the programmable feature turned on."
3,3 years old and I think it's done for.,"I wish I knew how long these were supposed to last. My Aunt has a digital thermostat in her house that's so old it has fake wood grain on it. (And I know it's been there at least 20 years.) So is that fantastic or does mine just suck?The symptom is that when on Auto, the fan starts and then stops and then starts and then stops. It happened a few times in the past couple of years, but I was able to take the thermostat off the wall and pop the batteries out and reset everything. (I stopped programming it, too.)This time the usual trick didn't work. Either the fan is off all the time, on all the time or sounding like it's making repeated failed attempts to rev up and take off. Since the closet it's in shares a wall with my bedroom and we should be below zero tonight, I think the fan will be staying on!I'm checking out different thermostats, but most of them seem to be made by the same company. Hopefully this one was just a lemon."
2,Good for the price,"No problem installing, or needing to clean any contacts as others stated earlier. Like the home override button for sure, but kicks back in to auto after midnight. Front faceplate could be a little sturdier. Will buy the touch screen next time around. Also, unit switched between winter and summer mode when was not needed, a big concern for us, with our dog home when we are at work."
1,Not for heat pumps,"This thermostat will not work for any heat pump that includes emergency heat, so it will not work for any heat pump that I've ever seen. They should make this clear in the product description."
1,heat sensor not accurate,"The heat sensor on this unit is not accurate. For instance, I set it to 72 degree and when the unit starts, it gets really hot in the house that by the time it stops after the unit shows 73 degree, on the unit I took off, the reading easily goes above 80 degree. I have another thermostat in the house and the reading is also way above 72 degree."
2,Finally replaced it,"I purchased this on October 23, 2010 and installed shortly thereafter.Instructions were a bit murky, but I got the job done.Seemed to work okay initially, but it was a bit of a pain to program.However, after a few months, it stopped holding the correct settings, so I needed to re-program every few weeks.Over the course of this past summer, it stopped holding settings all together. I needed to manually adjust the temperature every day and night. What a pain, and so much for having a programmable thermostat!I spent some time reviewing alternatives, and finally bit the bullet, and purchased the Nest (for $249 -- GULP!) Last night, for the first time in many months, we had stable temperature readings (and comfort levels). Wa-hoo! I'll keep a close eye for any problems, but so far, I am glad that I removed this Hunter from my wall."
2,Has a mind of it's own,"This thermostat has a mind of its own, do a temp change and a few minutes later goes to a different temp, I put the old one back on!"
3,Faulty motherboards?,"This is the second Hunter programable thermostat I've owned and I really like most everything about it ( really like the ""at home button"")--but after about 2 years it starts acting up. The heat will not come on until you adjust it at least 6 degrees above desired temp. This happened with both thermostats -- so, it wasn't just a lemon the first time. I think I'll try a different brand this time"
2,You get what you pay for,"This unit has great features for the price, but my unit only functioned for a few hours before ERR began to appear on the display. The manual lists this as a battery error. I attempted replacing the batteries several times only to have ERR reappear more and more frequently. While the device is in the ERR state your AC/Heat will not work. I'm sure I just received a defective unit, but the unit itself feels cheap. I replaced it with the Honeywell 8500 and haven't looked back. The Honeywell looks and feels much nicer ( and it worked), but it is more than twice as much.Kudos to Amazon for giving me a full refund on the defective unit."
1,Won't Turn Off!,"I found that my Hunter 44550 will not shut off the furnace or AC unit at times. It seems random but I will have to replace the thermostat and I won't be buying another Hunter. I tried resetting the unit to its defaults using the pin reset, but it still has the same problem at random. I also checked the wiring and still no luck finding any issues with a faulty setup. In my book if a ""Thermostat"" can't control the temperature then it gets one star for effort the other 6 days of the week."
1,Monroe 34953 & 34803 Shocks wrong application,I finally found time to get these shocks replaced and found out they were the wrong application. Too late to return now.These Monroe 34953 and 34803 are not for a 1989 Toyota 4x4 pickup. I think they are for a two wheel drive. Now I'm stuck with them. The application chart did not show 4 wheel drive.
4,A Nice Story,"This is a good story of two people who have been hurt in previous realtionships. Neither is looking for a long term committment. Fate has other plans for these two. Erica is a conservative women who usually doesn't do one night stands. When her friend Carolyn talks her into it Erica meets Nick Wilson. She doesn't know it at the time but he is the man who hire to decorate his house. Nick is attracted to Erica and can't get her out of his mind.The story reads well, the characters are believable, the love scenes are hot. This is really a feel good book"
2,Bad description,This item is fine except that it only has a few years on it and then some other words which I did not need. I ordered this one because it was the only one that appeared to have all years and not things like 'recd'. Not the case.
4,So far so good,"I first bought one of these units in October, which has been running w/o any issues since, even lasted through several power events in the data center. I now purchased another one and will be buying 2 more. I looked at similar products from Tripplite but decided against them as their reliability wasn't to my expectation (one of the reviewers commented that it went out after a couple of weeks of use). I have several single power source devices and this does the trick, wish they had one with slightly higher load as well as outlet facing amp meter (or any amp meter) other than the web frontend. Would be nice and in my opinion the only thing that caused me to give it 4 stars and not 5."
3,Very difficult!!!!,"This game is definitely fun but it is difficult for Bible reading adults, much less a ten year old. Good game, but too hard for kids."
3,Bible knowledge tester,I was a bit disappointed with the difficulty of this game. I would love to see a beginners level put on the market (something that would also help with a Sunday school class).
1,Catholic Edition?,"Why did my version have a sticker on it that says ""Catholic Edition?"" Nowhere in the product description do I see this indicated. I wanted to use this product with my youth group at church, but I am not Catholic, so this makes me leery of ordering anymore Bible games."
3,Good beginner's-level overview of basic recruiting options.,"An easy, quick read. Discusses pros and cons of traditional techniques for recruiting employees. Lacks depth and originality of ideas; good for a high school business student, for instance, but not substantial enough for experienced business professionals."
2,FLIMSY,way larger than you would expect. looks ok. broke up with the girl so im glad i got her a half ass cheap feeling and looking necklass. LATE
3,Wolverine ESP on location,"The concept of the product is good. Functionally, it works as advertised. I recently purchased the 80GB version and used it on location where electricity was scarce. I uploaded as many as 10,000 photos daily while camping. I was able to review my photos with ease. However, upon my return to my studio, the hard drive within the unit failed completely, unable to recognize the primary partition. My 63,000 plus photos which I could not re shoot were gone. Thank goodness for third party data recovery companies. Wolverine tech support was sympathetic and helpful, saying that I should have taken two units with me on location. They quickly replaced my new unit with a refurbished one. Many hundreds of dollars later, I was able to recover my data, but my confidence in this product was shaken. How can a new unit, less than a week old, always hand carried, fail so completely?"
4,Great for trips,"I bought this device to be a temporary storage device for pictures taken while I travel. I wanted to travel without my computer, and did not want to buy enough cards for an extended trip. This device has performed well for that purpose.The areas I am disappointed in are around the viewing.First, when viewing on the screen, the picture is displayed as expected for a relatively low resolution device. I knew this when buying, but I think the display could have been a little better.Second, the connection to the TV distorts the picture, so the display is much worse than having the picture displayed through the camera (connected to the TV).These two items are the disappointment, but the device was not bought for those purposes, so I am still very happy with this purchase."
4,Perfect for the purpose,"I'm an amateur photographer shooting only monstrous RAW formats (13 MP, from a Canon 5D). I bought the Wolverine to transfer the pictures from the CF card to a portable hard drive while in vacations. The transfer speed is adequate (faster than any laptop I used previously) and it does open the Canon RAW formats, just like advertised. I'm very happy with this. The mp3 side is average, but I don care too much (I have smaller players which I carry). I did test some movies - clips downloaded from Internet and works fine, except the ones protected. The charger is good for 100-220 V, so I had no problem using it in Australia. The CF interface is not the sturdiest, attention should be paid when the card is inserted or removed. Recently tried the Wolverine with an SD card from Canon G7, it works just fine. The radio has no antenna - only through the audio output. If nothing plugged in, there is no signal. The built in speaker sound just like a cell phone speaker."
4,Great way to back up photos - and share them with others,"I bought the ESP 80 primarily so that I could back up photos while traveling, AND see they were actually saved before erasing my memory cards. However, I'm finding that it's a great way to share photos with other people, too. (It also works fine for me as an MP3 player.) It's a bit heavy to carry all the time, or I probably would.The user interface took a little getting used to (sometimes I have trouble figuring out where you have to be in order for particular commands to be available) but it seems to be pretty consistent once you get the hang of it.The biggest problem I've had is when people ask me, ""What is it?"" A photo magazine referred to the similar Epson device as a ""storage viewer"" and that's what I'm going to call it."
4,Swiss army knife functionality,The analogy drawn by previous reviewer as to this being like a Swiss army knife has some merit.It does the upload from Flash cards very well however and I think this was the main design objective. The MP3 player works well provided your ripping is done on a machine that does not have anything else going on. Otherwise it's error correction facilities seem to not be able to resolve the issues.Many of my older MP3 files that I ripped on a busy machine and which WOULD play on dedicated MP3 players would not work on this one.The radio seems to works well enough provided you plug earphones in as I think it requires the cord to act as an antenna. I did not test the Video player and recorder and so cannot comment.So on balance an excellent flash card photo backup. Fine radio and usable MP3 player. 5 stars for the backup 3-4 starts on other features. The size and weight are not exactly small and light but not a knockout.
2,Won't read Nikon RAW,"Highly disappointed. It will not read Nikon RAW images. They don't tell you that up front, all it states is: ""will read raw images of most 'popular' cameras"". Well Nikon is a popular camera. If it does not read Nikon's I might as well have got a $150.00 unit that has no screen."
3,Not very romantic,It amazed me that Kyla ever managed to fall in love with Brett. From start to finish he was horrible to her. I thought there weren't enough tender expressions of his character to make him loveable. It seems they only had physical attraction to go on. All that aside it was still a pleasant read.
2,Hasn't changed much,"Boy, the only difference in her writing is the fact Kyla didn't sleep around. Some of her phrasing is exactly the same as Sweet Savage Love & Bret is not likeable. If I was her, I wouldn't have believed him when he finally says he loves her. Back in the 70's the leading man (hate to use hero) was dark and brooding, but they've loosened up since then."
1,No romance!,"I never liked Rosemary Roger's male characters very much but this one is the worst. What has he ever done to earn Kyla's love? He always treats her bad. Even when it comes to sex he's a brute. If you like sensible romantic lovers, forget it!"
1,What you see is NOT what you get,"I love the product, that is not the problem. The packaging is the problem. You think by looking at the photo of the jar that you are getting the jar full of detailing clay, right? No. It's ONE bar, in a large jar. You can get two smaller bars plus the detailing spray, a microfiber cloth and wax for $20 at any auto supply place. This is NOT a good value."
3,Great Product!,Worked great at getting the minor impurities off my car. The reflection is so much clearer
2,Didn't work for me,"I'm new to the use of detailing clay but this stuff did not work for me. I had some bug gunk and tree sap on my paint job and this clay did not remove it. I lubed the area with detail spray, flattened out a lump of the clay and rubbed it back and forth over the offending substances, re-lubing as necessary. The clay glided back and forth smoothly, but did not remove the gunk and sap. Finally got the stuff off with a microfiber cloth, detail spray and just a touch of pressure and rubbing."
1,"NO GOOD, BAD, WOULDN'T RECOMMEND",THIS IS NOT A GOOD PRODUCT. IT DOES NOT DO AS IT CLAIMS. I WOULDN'T WASTE MY MONEY ON IT.....
1,Worst electronics book ever!,"Save your cash, this is a terrible book. It's just a collection of bad circuits with almost no explanation. Most important topics are just casually covered with insufficient detail. The circuits are confusingly drawn and most are poorly designed. Get a good book like ""The Art of Electronics"", don't waste your money like I did, stay away from this one!"
2,Just kind of weird tasting...,This chili just did not have much flavor. It wasn't spicy at all either. I think if you add some other spices into it it would taste okay. I added cheese and that didn't help too much either.
5,A great basic word etymology for the non-linguist.,"I stumbled upon this jewel at the local Rancho Bernardo library. My high school english teacher in India, Mr. F. X. Paul, owned a tattered copy and used to read to us aloud a page or two in his grammar class. It helped relieve our boredom brought upon by trying to memorize grammar rules and sentence parsing.Funk gives you a non-technical discourse on word etymologies. Grouped by categories, and sorted alphabetically, common english words and their history is explained. The write-up on individual words is very interesting and makes for a superb read. I was intrigued by the history and usage of words like barrister and pettition.For a non-linguist like myself this book is a treasure trove of delight. Excellent resource."
1,Something is not right here,"The ""Look Inside"" preview shows that this was downloaded from the Internet and then cleaned up a bit. It's the 1897 (yes, 1897) translation by Henry Cary. Why in the world would anyone pay $20 for a public domain translation that is available for free, including a free Kindle edition? However, the ISBN number listed here seems to belong to a 2005 translation by J.G. Nichols. If you buy this book, which one will you really get? I don't know, and I'm not going to take a chance.There are hundreds of translations of the Divine Comedy, ranging from the really terrible to the really excellent, but it's very challenging to buy any of them here on Amazon, because the cover images and previews are often for completely different translations than the ones that match the ISBN number and it's hard to be sure what you will really get."
5,"Lyrical, beautiful and (for Italian Language students) lovely with the Italian on opposite page","This is a lovely, poetic translation with the text in Italian on the opposing pages. Definitely for the serious student of poetry, Dante and Italian. I did not find it a copy of the Cary translation."
2,ouch!,"These are so comfortable on the bottom of my foot but so uncomfortable on the top. I wore them for a few days on and off then wore them all day walking around NYC. My feet are still punishing me for it over a week later. The plastic thing between my toes hurts, but not as badly as the little button which connects the plastic to the upper part of the shoe. It left bruises between my toes! I'm hoping this is the breaking in period, but every time I put them on it hurts. I have plantar fasciitis, so the arch support is a god-send, but I may not be able to make use of it."
3,Womans Birkenstock Gizeh Birko-Flor Thong size 39,"If you buy the correct size for your foot you will end up loving these shoes. I wear them all day long. First you must know that there is a few weeks breaking in period so don't be in a hurry to decide if you like them or not. I did not like them for the first few weeks and the thong style was new to me. The breaking in period of time took longer than expected, but well worth it. I would recommend these shoes that are made in Germany. Be patient until your foot adjusts to the shoe and the shoe adjusts to the foot. You will love these just a much asI do."
4,love these shoes!,I wear these everywhere .. so comfortable! The only problem I have is that they are made with some suede. I wish they still had an all vegetarian version.
3,Birkenstock Thong,"These are very classy looking sandals, but the thong piece is hard plastic, not leather, and that made it pretty hard to break in. Still not completely comfortable between my toes. Cheaper brands I have bought use leather, why not Birkenstocks?"
1,"Big sizes for big people, but...","Birkenstock Gizeh Birko-Flor Thongs are wonderful IF they come in your size. Seven is way too big for me. I need a Birkenstock size 5; however you fail in offering the smaller sizes.Many of the women who shop on Amazon aren't as large as the average woman. If Amazon can't offer our sizes then, what's the point of shopping here?Interestingly enough Betula - Licensed by Birkenstock - does considerately offer the smaller sizes.I know it's possible to acquire smaller sizes in Birkenstocks, just not on Amazon."
4,Cute comfortable sandal,Love these shoes! Can dress up or down. Just not as super comfortable as my merrell sandals though...
2,too narrow,"I had been looking forward to this sandals, but was unable to wear them because they were just too narrow. I don't really have a wide foot, but I found these to dig into my feet at the sides. Had they been a flat sole, it would've been okay, but the fact the it's sort of indented makes them an uncomfortable sandle unless you have a very narrow foot. I was deeply disappointed."
5,LOVE IT!!!!! great shoe at a great price,"Great shoe @ an even better price. Birks are amazing, I live in south west Texas & it is HOT almost all year round, therefore we can wear sandal's most all year, Birks give great support with great style."
5,Love Birkenstocks,"These are my third pair of Gizeh Birkenstocks, and I love the greenish-goldish color I selected here. I don't require break-in time for Birkenstocks, but those who have never worn the brand before may need some getting-used-to time. Birkenstocks are very comfortable, and I love that these sandals can be worn with super casual outfits as well as with summer dresses."
3,No size would have fit my foot,"These sandals looked so beautiful and would have gone with anything, but the cut was not at all right for my foot. In order for my big toe and second toe to be positioned correctly to hold the leather, my toes were pitched to the the very front of the sole so they looked too small in the front but too big in the back. If I had gone a size smaller, I think my toes would have hung over and I do not have long toes! I spoke with my niece who has very different feet than I do and she had the same experience. My advice to anyone ordering online is to try them on in a store first."
1,"Uncomfortable, darker color than appears on the screen","This pair of shoes is uncomfortable because the thong bar digs into my big toe. Also, the color is darker than it appears on the computer screen. I was disappointed in the brown-ness of the color and was expecting more of a golden bronze. Not as neutral as expected."
4,comfortable stylish,comfortable and very funky. got a lot of complements on this shoe. if you like bikenstocks you will love the unique design of this shoe combined with the comfort of the cork footbed.
5,"Hundreds of full-page color photos and discussions of unique designs, materials, crafts","Dona Z. Meilach's Teapots: Makers & Collectors covers all the new teapots from whimsical and non-functional works of art to practical and collectible teapots. Much more than a price guide alone, however, Teapots: Makers & Collectors packs in hundreds of full-page color photos and discussions of unique designs, materials, crafts. Artists in 14 countries are represented in a review which produces both a history and a guide for contemporary collectors."
1,WORST book to use for CPA Review,"This book is too detailed and go off on stuff that's not relevant on passing the cpa exam. This book is for people who want to know all of accounting and not just focusing on passing the exam. It has all these unnecessary stuff that are you don't need to know for the exam. Unlike other review materials that has about 9 chapters, this book has 20 chapters. If other materials can help you pass on just 9 chapters, why does this book has 20? Who has time to remember 20 chapters on each section. In addition the book is poorly written, the materials are hard to understand and topics are all over the place. I also regret getting the audio tutor tapes, they are a bore and useless. This whole package is a total waste of money, you're better off saving some money and getting the wiley book and studying on your own or pay some money and get a real review course like becker. Like they say, you get what you pay for. Stay away from Bisk."
2,Decent read,"Not the best Shadowrun book written, but not too bad if you like the world's setting. Probably the most jarring problem with the book is that it appears some editor chose to do a global search & replace on the word ""frag"" and replace it with the word ""frig"". Readers familiar with the jargon of the Shadowrun world may find this more than a little irritating. (I know I did - it was like driving down a six lane expressway and finding a stop sign.)"
2,Not quite as good as they say...,"Well, a movie can be clever and sharp and have a lot of interesting characters, and still be kind of boring and pointless.I know that for some reason this film was celebrated because of Harvey's unique point-of-view and insight into his dead-end empty life. I'm not sure exactly why. I guess he found a unique way to be unhappy which spoke to a lot of people. He is the shlub-everyman. Yippee.This unpleasant, drab movie has something to say - but I don't know why anybody really needs to hear it. Idiocyncracy is not a value in itself. My sense is that this film has some cultural cache' that isn't well-deserved.C'est la vie. With Splendor's success there will be new classes in film school on the art of gently wasting screen-time."
5,You have to Try the Pina Coladas!,"The most entertaining, and certainly of the most original films of the past year! American Splendor is about Harvey Pekar, a file clerk at a hospital in Cleveland, and how he began to document his life by means of the underground comic book scene.The actual Harvey Pekar narrates the film, and is in the film during the Letterman scenes (which are hilarious), and as the camera takes the viewer to Harvey for an occasional brief interview. Paul Giamatti plays Harvey in his younger years, and does a bang-up job, as the sarcastic, gloomy file clerk. Hope Davis does an outstanding job as well as Joyce (Pekar's wife- who also appears in the film briefly).This is a must see for all who are tired of little old ladies in the checkout lines, Hollywood films like ""revenge of the Nerds which, according to Pekar, don't accuratly portray what real nerds have to go through, and stupid people."
4,Really captured the essence of Cleveland,"Being a lifelong Clevelander, I must say this movie captured the feel of Cleveland better than any other movie I've ever seen. It may be that you have to live in the area to feel it, but it can give outsiders a feel of this drab city. Fantastic, if just for that reason."
5,Harvey Pekar is a winner!,This film rates as one of the most creative and playful I've ever seen. The way the two versions of Harvey play off each other and the way his comic and his real life intertwine is pure genius. Paul Giamatti is at his finest.Excellent!! Two thumbs up!!
5,NOWHERE MAN...,"The Plot: Harvey Pekar took his dead-end life as a file clerk in the early Eighties and became a minor celebrity by basing a hit cult comic around himself. From the difficulties of being stuck in line at a supermarket through to battling Cancer, his work is brilliantly portrayed as the film uses a mix of animation, the perfectly cast Giamatti, while blending both archive footage and recent narration by the real life Pekar perfectly.Standout Scene: As reality is suspended briefly the actors take a backseat to listen to Pekar & the supremely funny Toby Radloff take centre stage.Any Good? Pekar once called out David Letterman's talk show as manipulative shtick and American Splendor makes no bones about giving one in the eye to the establishment too. This is a genuinely funny film from the ultimate `anti-American-Dreamer,' and should definitely not be missed."
5,Just say no to middle age crisis and low wages!,"Good movie but this dude does not represent no one I know, lmao! I mean this guy was just depressed about life, boo hoo Im a under paid worker, too cynical and sadistic for my taste, but in all for the representation of comic books and American splendor in particular, a great well deserved high opinionated movie. His girlfriend went from being a man's dream girl because of her love for comics, to a lazy quitter, who slept all day, if I were him she would have been out on her A_Z_Z! lmao! This is one of those movies that is only good to watch one time, because it is so depressing. lmao! ..........................Dayum I hope I never go through this and feel as this man did................hmm Im under payed now! oh well Theres no business like your own business.................... two fingers in a v-shape =)"
1,There's something missing here...,"From all the great reviews I read about this movie, I thought this would be a great change from all the intellectually devoid movies out there. I like comics, Paul Giamatti and any deviation from your typical hollywood movie. But this has gotta be one of the most boring and difficult movies I've ever watched. The characters are very uninteresting and I never really cared about anything going on. And this guy narrating various points of his own life got really annoying! I think it's a great idea, but the way it's executed made the movie even more uninteresting...I will not recommend this movie to anyone."
4,A Nice Film,"I didn't know what to expect from 'American Splendor'. The previews made it look so mundane, pehaps a little boring. But it made it onto countless top ten lists, and I never heard anything bad about it, so I watched it.It was good. It's actually a nice little story about a man & the people he surounds himself with. It had a lot less to do with the world of comics, & a lot more to do with the day to day of life. It was sweet.I loved how the filmmaker's/editors interspersed the real Harvey with the actor Harvey; it was all quite clever without falling into any pretension.Recommended."
4,Fascinating Wackos,"I guess I am sucker for biographies of weird people. This certainly qualifies for that.What makes this film different from others is the combination of fictional and real people playing the two main characters: Harvey and Joyce Pekar. For most of the film, Paul Giamatti portrays Pekar - the main focus of the film, and Hope Davis plays his wife, Joyce. However, interspersed in the film are comments from the real Harvey and Joyce!The only thing stranger that the film structure is the story of these actual people. You wouldn't think that two dull introverts like this could be made to look so interesting, but they are. What a testimony to the job the filmmakers did here....and the actors. Giamatti was amazing.After seeing this movie, I was inspired to go out and obtain several of Harvey Pekar's comic books. Whew! I should have stuck with just the movie. The comics stink!! Don't waste your money on those."
4,I'm Impressed,"I left the USA in 1999, so I have no clue about any of the material that preceded this film. It was some underground comic books and I don't know what else. Coming into it with no clue about all this background, I was quite impressed. The movie does pull you into the world of Harvey Pekar, which apparently blurs the boundaries between fact and fiction to give us ordinary life. It's also an excellent trip through the 60s, 70s and 80s, and a great way to spend a couple of hours, and you'll think about it after it's over. In other words, get it."
2,Why bother?,"These minidisk players/recorders lock a user to some Sony's proprietary format (Atrac3) and software, and impose severe limitations on how your music collection (MP3, WMA and so on) may be copied from/to these devices (see WWW for details).So I just ask myself why a one would want to use this thing if there are so many (much cheaper) alternatives available that don't impose all these annoying restrictions?"
4,Dengar .,"I would say he is one of the better Star Wars dolls. His face sculpt is good, and his costum is pretty top-notch. His costum is thick to make him look like the fat, and the body that Hasbro used is the basic G.I. Joe body."
5,beautiful,"This video is a besutiful concert of Crystal Gayle. Her voice, I think, is supeior to anyone I have ever heard. Her beauty is unmatchable. It is a great joy to get to sit and watch this vedeo."
4,LOVE IN ATHENS,"Koula. Menis Koumandareas. Translated by Kay CicellisKOULA(1978), a novella, is set in modern-day Athens. Its principal characters and only direct speakers are introduced as ""a mature woman"" and ""a young man"", who habitually encounter each other on an underground, commuter train, get to know each other, and glide into an affair. Koula, married to Haris, has two, nearly adolescent daughters in a nice suburb. An accountant by day, she laments the ""dreary"" routine and habit of work, home, and family, but by story's end relishes its secure familiarity .Between the first and last is the relationship of Koula and Dimitri, which brings out surprising emotional and physical changes in Koula. Through their closeness and separation, she becomes aware of a humanitarian connection to self and others--coworkers, family, strangers--and to world events. Her future will be ""a long, arduous odyssey""(88), in other words, both uneventful and eventful."
5,A great tale,"This book is a load of fun. It is unique in its approach and storytelling, and should be interesting to all ages."
4,Beware of Calvin's footprints!,"...If you are well grounded in the faith, Steadfast and immovable (Col1:22-23) read this book to sharpen your discernment. In studying these men we get a better understanding of what we are up against presently. When you discover the full scope of Calvin's destructive doctrines, his five points, and how everything ultimately concludes with `unconditional' eternal security, you will see the handprints of Satan in every tenant. These men planted the seeds of modern day easy believeism, although unaware of their negative influence, the things they taught will ring throughout eternity in the ears of millions of lost souls who bought into their security in sin message."
4,Leyland spins a gem 1992,"I root for the Tigers, and enjoyed the book a lot - obviously in 1996 Leyland worked his magic. I do wonder though if he has progressed with the times as regards the VERY sub par performance(s) of the Tiggies last year."
1,could not use,The cartridges were dry with no ink. I could not use them had to throw them away. I guess they were too old and ink dried out.
4,great loud alrm clock,I needed an alarm clock I could hear with my hearing loss. I've lost over 50% of my hearing but this clock easily wakes me up. Have to be careful to make sure alarm is set as the on/off are side by side and several times I did not have on. Would buy it again.
1,A Broken Clock is Correct Twice a Day,"Except in the case of a digital clock. I would love to give this clock radio a better review because it has a red LED which is sorely lacking in today's clock radios and it has a simple setup. I have to give this one star because, although this is only a $6 alarm clock, I would expect the clock to function correctly. I have to be very vigilant with the time on the clock because the clock will move forward by 20 minutes every day meaning I have to reset the clock every day. Now I understand that $6 isn't very much these days I would expect the absolutely essential part of a product to work correctly."
2,Great for a while,I really enjoyed it till it suddenly died a couple weeks after buying it... it actually got quite hot... something probably burnt up inside. Amazon made the return/refund super easy.
1,No reception,"I bought this clock radio because the very old one I listen to every morning while I get ready had problems with its switch - it still worked, but the switch wouldn't turn the radio off anymore. This clock radio is a huge disappointment. It doesn't pick up the local station that I listen to for traffic, weather and news. So, I feel like I was ripped off. I don't understand why the ancient clock radio that I was planning on replacing picks the station up great, but this new radio doesn't get the station at all no matter how I fiddle with it. It has a very poor tuner."
2,complicated and not worth it,"I received this as a Christmas present and was disappointed after reading it. The recipes called for a lot of ingredients, most of which you wouldn't typically keep in your house. The meals definitely weren't inexpensive and some didn't sound very appetizing. I didn't find one meal that my husband and I would both eat, nor would I have time to make it since we both work. This book is better for someone who doesn't work and has time to cook. For everyone else, it's not worth it to purchase this book."
5,This is a great cookbook!!!,"I really, really love this cookbook. I would guess that I use it at least 10-15 times a month. And when I am not cooking something out of it, I will look through it just to get ideas. I don't understand why the people who put up the one and two star reviews feel the way they do. I think this book has very good, easy, and interesting recipes that DO NOT call for a lot of wierd or hard to find ingredients. In fact, it is for this last reason that I use it so much. In fact, I love this cookbook so much that I am giving it as a gift to someone this Christmas. For me to do that is the ultimate compliment on a cookbook, because I will only give a cookbook as a gift if I know it is an excellent one."
3,One proof short of ready for publishing,"There are great recipes in this book - cookies for each month, craft ideas for kids, etc. However, there are so many little things wrong with this book that one more good proof read would have caught. There are tips for taking the fat out of recipes on the same page as a recipe for lasagna that calls for TEN cups of cheese. There is great vagueness throughout in the measurements. What is ""one small package"" or ""one small can?"" There is a recipe for roast that calls for 90 minutes of cooking time and various other ingredients but makes no reference to the weight of the meat used. Lots of reliance on hot dogs, cheese whiz, canned soups, etc. That said, if you sift the obviously weak recipes out, there are some good solid recipes in this book. You just need to look for them. I got this book on deep discount for less than $5, so all in all, it's been worth it."
5,Great For Busy Professionals,"As a bi-vocational pastor, my time to cook is rather limited by the time constraints of my jobs. What is best about this book is the recipes are simple enough for my 12 year old son to prepare and it helps our planning trips to the grocery store with affordable food items. Busy people should put this book on their Mother's Day shopping list, their school graduates shopping list, their birthday and Christmas lists. Guaranteed smiles at the dinner table."
3,Not my favorite,Used side by side with Nu Finish and I prefer the results of Nu Finish. I ended up mixing the 2 waxes together. Will not try other products again.
3,Meguiar's Cleaner Wax,"I tried Meguiar's Cleaner Wax because I've used other Meguiar's products and really liked them. But I can guarantee you that this stuff will NOT cut water spots or any other minor imperfection on your paint finish. It goes on beautifully and comes off even better, but will not take any kind of mark off. NuFinish does, and it will easily last a year. I've used NuFinish for years and will have to stick with it for that reason."
1,"Not impressed, fall flat within a week.",I bought these hoping for really good arch support in my work shoes (usually flats). Well they seemed ok for about a week but still not as supportive as I expected and now it's almost like there is zero arch and they flatten out. I wouldn't waste my money again on these. I did purchase http://www.amazon.com/Profoot-SuperSport-Arch-Support-Womens/dp/B000GCNCQ6/ref=wl_it_dp_o_pdT1_nS_nC?ie=UTF8&colid=2FXMUTADGLU0R&coliid=I19DF18B5V7NI0 shortly after and wow can't beat the price and the support is really really good!!! Honestly the leather incoles are worthless.
2,FootSmart Leather Arch Insoles,"I am not happy with the arch support of FootSmart Leather Arch Insoles. They ofter little to no support. Ok if you don't need support, but why buy anything if that is the case."
3,Cover doesn't make sense,"I've got two questions about this book's front cover:1) Why is Stacey on the cover if she didn't come back from New York City until #28, Welcome Back, Stacey??2)If Jessi's on the cover, why not Mallory? She joined the club along with Jessi in #14, Hello, Mallory."
5,It was a good and interesting book to read,"I've always loved the Baby sitter club books they are very interesting to read espiessialy this book, this book was about that Charlotte,Myrah, claire and Margo pike join a peagent and they get baby sitters to help them like claudia, dawn, and kristy they become very involved in it and try to make them win."
1,WHAT A BOOOOORING BOOK!,"I think this is the most boring book! It dragged on and on and on! The cover was attractive, though. What did Dawn have to do with the Little Miss Stoneybrook? I wondered when I first saw the book.I thought Jeff was a spoiled rotten little brat. The parents should not have rewarded his bad attitude/behavior by giving him what he wanted: a return to California.I read this book when I was 12 or 13 and thought it was boring but read it anyways because I followed the series religiously. Back then, I was disappointed that none of the BSC charges who participated in the pagent won, and thought that the judges used very bad judgment in picking their winner, as the winner was horrible. However, in hindsight, I am glad non of their charges won; beauty pagent life is phoney, superficial, hoity-toity and very hard. I am going to read this book again and as an adult I might appreciate it more than I did at 13."
1,Product Poor / Seller Great,"Within two hours of recieving my complaint the seller refunded my money, without requriing that I ship the product back. For that I am thankful and appreciative, and can recommend the seller. I have no idea what was up with the product.As I noted earlier, I just recieved this product and it has the overwhelming smell of petroleum, literally like the smell that comes from an oil truck delivering fuel oil to your home. I bought this for a child and would never dream of giving it to them. I am contacting the seller to request a refund. If I succeed I will note that in the review and increase the star rating."
2,Pretty but ...,"Cheaply made.... Of course, I knew that when I bought it due to the price. I ended up hanging it on a wall because I knew the strap would break if I tried to use it as a purse."
3,Cute but undersized,"Would like to have been able to use this w/comb, compact, lipstick, changepurse in it. Found it a mite undersized.Also found some of the beading was a little loose.Maybe other reviewers' description as ""fun"" is apt...for a young person."
5,Love My Purple Poodle!,"I got this Purple Poodle after a back injury. Not only is she very fragrant with the Lavender, but she is soft, and great to cuddle! This little poodle is also very well made ... I am quite pleased with the quality."
4,I'm satisfied,"This book is a mix between simple to advanced topics. You must have at least a little bit of experience with the C++Builder, to understand the examples. I really liked a lot that the author explained what it is happening, not like other books that you have to read the examples an figure it out, what some things are for. The narrative is simple, so it is easy to read and follow. Examples are clear, and they work like are supposed to. For beginners and intermediate users it is a great book, because there are many things to learn. I recommend it to have it."
5,Country Music Diva TRUDY ANDES,"I recently purchased what I feel to be one of the best CD's of a Country Artist. I was sitting at a funeral when Trudy Andes started singing ""Amazing Grace"" My heart Stood Still, I felt this emotion rise within me, and my eyes filled with tears, I looked around the room, and there was not a dry eye in the room, this girl had so much emotion in her voice, she made the room STOP, Security had to walk her out, she was mobbed by onlookers, She is beautiful and has a god given talent. The CD is Fantastic! Michael Lawrence COUNTRY MUSIC MAGAZINE."
5,It is Great!,"I do computer Software, and here at our offices we listen to Trudy Andes CD everyday! It is really good! I recommend it for anyone wanting fantastic music."
4,Lots of info but not many photos,"This book was not all I expected it to be. I appreciate and find valuable the in depth information about considering, choosing, buying diamonds, etc. There are many incredibly informative areas to read through and based on information I would give this book a 10 but I was looking for more pictures and a more visual history of engagement/wedding rings. Information is terrific and it prepares you for the shopping experience but this is not the book for you if you want more of a pictorial."
4,Much more confident buyer after referencing this book.,"This is a great reference book if all you know about engagement rings is what the four ""c's"" stand for. The tables were the most helpful references and it is written so you can reference areas you want most to learn about. There is more than enough information, including a lot of history and information on other stones other than diamonds. It even gave me a dollar range to expect, which was the biggest unknown for me."
1,I can't see the stars through the clouds,"After reading quite a few books in this category; I found Matlins book informative but not practical in the real world. The book was in my opinion too generalized and wasn't what I needed, i.e. expert advise on how to buy a top quality diamond from a reputable jeweler at the best price. If you want to learn about the history of the diamond the book might pass but won't tell you what you need to know if your out shopping for one."
3,x10?,"good basic probe for the price, be sure to check the attenuation before trusting the advertized X10 setting. mine when checked on a 9v battery was 9.54v on x1, and 5.01v on x10."
3,"Very Interesting, But....","This is a must read for any and all interested in the men behind the executions; specifcally, in Albert Pierrepoint and England's other hangmen. There are problems, however. For example, Brian Bailey makes some egregious errors of fact, two of which are glaring: First, Herman Goering's corpse was not hanged. Second, Caryl Chessman died in San Quentin's gas chamber, not its (non-existent) electric chair. Mr. Bailey's worst offense, however, is his self-righteous and drumbeat condemnations of the death penalty, and his condescending and nasty attitude toward those ignorant and barbaric enough to be proponents of the death penalty (a group of which I'm proud to be a member). After all, Mr. Bailey's book is subtitled ""The History of Execution from Jack Ketch to Albert Pierrepoint,"" not ""The Death Penalty Has Been Repealed; How Smug I Am."" With these provisos in mind, the book is worth looking for, finding, and reading."
3,Decent,"Decent book, if you wan't to learn more about low-carb it's great, but I feel like the studies are 'handpicked' to support his view of low-carb dieting."
5,A must read for those living the low-carb life,"This is one of the most extensively-researched books on the market dealing with low-carb dieting. It has a vast bibliography and a very comprehensive resources section. The author describes, in some detail, each of the many low-carb diet plans and how they may be suited to you as an individual. There is also a section on low-carb myths, how low-carb diets actually work, and frequently-asked questions. There is even a chapter on controlled-carb dieting and how it differs from the typical low-carb diet.It's well-written and easy to understand, but has a wealthy of useful information, especially about the history and politics of dieting."
1,Misrepresented product,"The product I received was Flea and Tick mist,not Flea and Tick with IGR.When I spoke to Entirely pets after an 8 minute hold time,I was told they do not even carry the product with IGR.Waste of time"
1,Fleas,"The service as far as receiving the product was great, but sadly I still have fleas and I know I have soaked these animals in this stuff.........I am really wondering if there is anything that really works, all that I have tried sure don't"
5,great!,"Hilarious- dopey monsters, crazy story line, all delivered inin true deadpan serious Dr. Who style. Tom at his goggle-eyed best."
5,one of the best Doctor Who adventures ever!,"This is a review of the story, not the DVD.""Ark in Space"" is a great story on all counts. The chemistry between Tom Baker and Liz Sladen positively sparkles -- they're obviously having a great time, and so the viewer does, as well. The scenes where the Doctor essentially calls Sarah Jane a sissy are hilarious -- he knows how to punch all her buttons to get her to be the brave and competent companion he knows she is. Tight, tense, well-written and directed -- this is one of my all-time favorites.""Aliens"", anyone?"
4,Not as cool if you're an adult.,"This one has great moments like the guy discovering that his hand has turned into green mold or Tom Baker going off about the greatness of the human race for no reason whatsoever. ANd the whole body storage scene still gives me nightmares. But overall this particular storyline was better when you were 8. Granted, I still have affection for this one since it turned me into a Doctor Who fanatic, but I can't mitigate the fact that it loses steam once the giant wasps show up. Until then it's as tight a scienc fiction thriller as you're ever going to get."
2,Fun story but poor video quality,I enjoy most any Dr. Who with Tom Baker. The quality of this tape is very poor however. Had to adjust every control on my TV just to watch it.
2,Modern-style Rebetika,"This is a medley of anodyne modern rebetika.For those that prefer the older, Ottomanesque rebetika try Amazon's other ""REMBETICA"" of ""WOMEN OF REMBETICA"" CD's"
1,Read this before buying,The product did not work at all with my Ipaq hand held unit. Customer service not very good at all. Bad product overall.
1,Racist Garbage,"If the Author wanted to speak out against racism, then why not speak about racism in GENERAL and overall look at racism from all races, instead of assuming that only whites have power in the entire world therefor only whites can be racist.... What about China, Japan, South Africa, South America, etc.. where whites hold NO power at all and are discriminated against ten times more than non-whites in the U.S.?The fact remains that the Author of this book obviously holds anti-white beliefs in the topic of race. If you are looking for a study on racism, reading this book is equivalent to reading a book written by the KKK or the Black Panther Party. It is one-sided and bias."
3,"Decent writing, interesting topic, many errors.","Far below Harrison's previous works. Another techno-thriller in which dozens of average American government workers commit mass murder to keep a conspiracy secure. Military folks I know are clear that their oath is to the Constitution, not the boss or the job at hand. Interesting info on the Area 51/Groom Lake rumors. Harrison badly needed a military advisor on Special Ops: Major Generals do not command a two-company task force, light divisions do not parachute, individual Marines are not in SpecOps Command (some select units are)."
3,A lot of conspiracy - not as good as earlier efforts,"Like many others, I have been waiting in anticipation for Harrison's newest effort, and after a solid night of reading, I came away vaguely dissapointed.The main problem here is not the conspiracy, but the nature of the conspiracy. I immediately begin to lose interest when anything with ""aliens"" is mentioned. I was hoping for a more hard-technology novel like Intrepid or Thunder, which I believe definately deserve 10/10.Probably an attempt to branch out to a new genre, but Harrison should stick to what he does so well."
2,Not very good.,"This reads like a quick attempt to cash in on the X-FILES. There is nothing here that hasn't been done before, and been done better. The author pulls out all the usual suspects -- Area 51, captured alien craft, government cover-up -- nothing we haven't seen before. It's the kind of stuff X-FILES did in its first season (five years ago!) No real point in reading this one, I see why it went straight to paperback."
2,Far below his other efforts,"Harrison looks like he sat down and cranked out a formulatic novel in an afternoon. I thoroughly enjoyed his previous efforts but this one is lacking. The novel ambles along, no character development, weak plot. I also wonder why it went direct to paperback. Could it be the publisher felt it was a sub par effort? I would have been better off re-reading Storming Intrepid."
5,Best of the Bunch,"I've got all three of the E-town live discs and, while they're all great, this is the best. The Blind Boys of Alabama cut alone is worth the purchase price."
1,The worst cookbook I have ever purchased.,"This is an absurdity and an insult to Mexican cooking. The combinations are revolting, the variations strained. It doesn't even tell you how to make a REAL tamale."
2,Too gourmet!,"Was really looking forward to getting this cookbook, but boy was I disappointed. Just wanted recipes for regular tamales but got ""too gourmet"" recipes. Not even one chili cheese tamale recipe! Not satisfied with this cookbook...........Great cover but lousy recipes."
2,Odd book,So where is written that lard is worse for you than oil? Do some research and you'll find it's high in oleic acid. Fat is fat and too much is bad. So that's how the book starts out. Thge authors are so busy being innovative (and often pushing reality beyond its limits) that they forget you how to make a delicious regular old tamal!
5,WOW... What a Tamale,Just a brilliant book about tamales....The three chefs seem to have taken the time to simplify one of the greatest meals ever.. the Mexican tamale!I have made almost every recipe in the book and have loved all of them....
3,Too Much,Bought it for the wife who already makes tamales. She looked through it once and said that it's not likely that she would use it. Way too far out from what most would consider a tamale. Buy a more basic book.
5,working mom,"I have had at least 6 pairs of these shoes, over the years. They used to come in many colors, blue, dark brown faux ostrich etc. These are the best shoes, and sadly getting very hard to find. There is no break-in period, they do get easier to slip on and off as time goes by. There is plenty of clearance across the top of my foot, unlike other brands I have tried that LOOK similar to these. The leather inside lining is wonderful. I hope Roper continues to make these, but seems they may be fazing them out. That is why there is no 7.5 I bought them all."
5,Why this 10-year old kid liked this book.,"Length:: 1:04 MinsHi,My name's Max. I made this video so you can decide if you want to buy it for your kids."
5,The real deal. Recommended.,"James Randel is the real deal, an investor in commercial properties who tells you how he did some of his deals. Not some puff merchant telling you how to buy with no cash down. Write another please soon!"
5,Kick Start Your Brain,"If you are looking for a step by step buy a house, rehab it, and get rich, please find another book. If you are looking for a dull textbook type presentation you should also pass.If you are looking for clear explanations of concepts and illustrated with some small case studies to kick start your brain, then this might be just the thing to get you from dreaming to doing.Although I knew almost all the concepts presented, this book made them much more concrete. I have already begun the process of actually doing instead of sitting on my butt thinking about doing!Thank You!!"
4,Informative and Entertaining,"Informative and entertaining read. Author recounts stories of previous real estate transactions he completed personally or on behalf of clients. Best advice is to purchase under one pricing model and sell under a different and more valuable pricing model (i.e., purchase multifamily buildings valued as apartment rentals and then sell individual units as condominiums). Author admits that condo-conversion opportunities have all but eliminated the ability to purchase convertable multifamily buildings at apartment value, so he advises to ""look around the next corner versus in the rear view mirror."" Therein lies the problem with the book-- such advice is easier said than done."
5,Great read,"For a novice like myself I found Randel's book to be informative, engaging and most of all fascinating. If you are interested in any aspect of real estate you should pick up this book."
5,not bad,This book talks about multi-millions' commercial investment project which is not for a normal small investor like me. A few stories from the author which seems too good to be true. But this book gives you many thoughtful ideas. Simple and easy way to calculate the returns
5,Great insights from a professional,"The author shares some excellent tools for real estate success. He is in the industry and not an ""ivory tower"" instructor. I enjoyed this book greatly and highly recommend it to anyone in commercial real estate."
4,Inspration and Insightful,"Finally a book for someone in the NE to read and understand NE real estate numbers, both insightful and inspirational."
1,Piece Of Junk,"I bought this to replace my existing bulb and didn't work? What a hassle. If I had the time to box it up and return it, I woudn't of ordered it on line."
5,Excellent resource,"This is a great resource for anyone who has a good knowledge of New Testament Greek and wants a copy of the New Testament in Greek. This is NOT an interlinear (first line in Greek, second line a literal English translation); the Greek text here remains un-translated. However, the NIV and NRSV translations appear to the left and right of the block of Greek text, which is the United Bible Societies' 4th edition. This is the best critical text available. The alternate textual readings appear in the Greek text only if they are found in the footnotes of the NIV and/or NRSV. So, every alternate reading may not be present in this Greek New Testament. Overall, this is a very useful book, and as a student of the Greek language, I have used it many times."
5,NIV/NRSV/Greek New Testamant side by side!,"This is a great resource for personal study. I am glad that i own it. In my opinion, it has one significant flaw: it has no dictionary. I wish I could look up what some of the salient Greek verbs mean at the back without always having to run and find my huge lexicon or thumb through the back of my UBS 3rd edition GNT. But this minor quibble aside, it is a nice resource because it beats having to pull 3 separate Bibles off of the shelf."
5,The Best Book I've ever read.,"When I commenced reading The Mask of Time I was tempted to put it down. That would have been my loss, it was a book that has remained firmly entrenched in my mind, since it was published. I recommended the book to everyone I knew who was a reader. It surpassed the expectations of everyone I knew. It has a wonderful plot. This book kept me up for 3days and nights,I took it to lunch, the beach, everywhere I went until I finished it. I was sorry when I had finished it. The end of the tale was a little weak, but despite that, this is one book that should have been a blockbuster.An absolutely wonderful tale. His more recent books have been enjoyable, but he will find it difficult to write a book that will surpass The Mask of Time. When I become a very old person I will always remember this book and I've read a lot of books!!"
4,lupin the third for kids,"monkey punch's lupin the third was recreated by a few directors and this one was from Mr. Hayao Miyazaki, but this movie was made a decade after the original TV series, so a huge difference from the original TV series. The original was soooo slick and dry that i felt i was watching something that not suite for my age. :D however, it was really well made and so popular. so from the point of view, this motive was for children friendly version of lupin the third. if you are older than 15 years old, you may want to watch the original TV series. you would not believe it was made like in 1970 or 1971."
3,"Fun, strange, and not for everyone",We enjoyed watching the Castle of Cagiostro with our 3 little boys. It was a little boring in bits. Definitely had an unAmerican tale which we liked--kind of a Japanese/Austrian/East European tale of spies and princesses.Warning there is violence and macabre in the story. Not just skeletons but gushing blood in parts. Not for everyone's kids.You can really see the beautiful scenery and artwork associated with Hayao Miyazaki's later films. The film really just made me want to watch Spirited Away again.
4,Obviously the work of Miyazaki,"This movie is extremely enjoyable, and it obviously carries Miyazaki's destinctive touch. It's a very funny film that captures the qualities of sixties spy movies very, very well - that's part of what makes it so funny! The characters are well depicted, even when the viewer has not seen the show this movie was made for (Lupin III). This was a great place for Hayao Miyazaki to start his directing career and it's a great buy for any Studio Ghibli fan. The DVD is good quality, including the Japanese language track and English subtitles, but I (as I usually do) found the translation in the English Dub rather disappointing. That's to be expected though, and it's okay, as you can just watch it in it's original format."
5,MASTERPIECE!,"A copy of the old dub of this movie fell into my hands a few years ago, and quickly became one of my favorite films. The huge mysterious castle with all its secrets, the outrageous physical comedy, and of course the wonderful character of ""The Wolf"" himself all make this movie a masterpiece! I'm delighted to see this movie re-released. I just bought the subtitled edition and I'm very happy with it! (I'm keeping my old dub edition too... it's got some great jokes in it and the voicing is outstanding, especially Lupin himself). However, this new subtitled edition is a MUST-HAVE! Being so close to the original, it has lots of stuff in it that was changed or skimmed over in the old dub (like the Princess' feelings that she had blood on her hands as well because of her ancestor's actions, which adds a lot of depth to her that just wasn't there in the old dub). So even if you are familiar with the previous version of this movie, you must also see the sub! You will love this movie!"
2,English dub not appropriate for younger children,"We are big Miyazki fans. Lupin III was one of the only ones we don't have. However, the dub was done more for teenage anime fans, than for family watching. In the first 4 minutes you have ""son of a bi***"", ""bast***"", ""he**"", and ""sh**"". We stopped there - I can only assume this carries on throughout the film.We watch Miyazaki films precisely to avoid this type of gratuitous language. Usually the PG/PG-13 ratings have to do with the violence intrinsic to the moral conflict of the film - which is something you can discuss with children. This language was a pointless addition."
5,Miyazaki always does it excellently,"The first time i saw a film by Miyazaki was when i saw the ""Heidi"" anime, then not long ago i saw, Mononoke Hime, and it was wonderful, and this one also is, it's very funny, very exhiting, and sometimes suspenful, it's great, i love it."
3,Rated pg-13 for a reason,I was dissappointed. This movie has swearing in it. I would not recommend it to anyone who has small children. It's rating is accurate. The movie does have lots of action(fighting)and Lupin uses cool gadgets and stunts to get around. If you don't mind the swearing and like action this movie is for you.
2,"We love Miyazaki, but found Cagliostro wanting.","We are a family of four, and buy DVD's for all of us to watch. The two girls, ages 4 and 7, have loved many Miyazaki films. They often have a young girl as protaganist and they identify with the character. Kiki's Delivery Service, Howl, Castle in the Sky, and Nausicaa may be their favorites.Castle of Cagliostro has more of a prototype feeling. The animation is less detailed, and more common in style. The characters are always in action, and don't stop and have the heartfelt moments that some of the later films have.All in all it seems like what it is: an animated TV show made long. Even his early movies show signs of the greatness that would come later, but I don't think we'll watch it again."
1,NOT SUITABLE for Children,"Although the plot is fine for children, there is such an abundance of 3- 4- and 5-letter bad words that I do not want my 7-yr-olds watching it. All unneccesary, because it was dubbed and could have avoided those vulgarities."
1,"Boring, Boring, Boring...","I bought this DVD because I liked Princess Mononoke so much. However, I found this one to be absolutely boring. There just wasn't enough action in this feature. It felt like I was always waiting for *something* to happen, but it never did."
4,The castlew of Cagliostro,This movie is interesting and if your looking fro an action packed movie this is it. This movie isn't rated and does contain fowl language. But that's because it's dubed in American and it needs to be more Americanized. If your kids want james bond but are too young try this.
5,"Action, Adventure, and one suave theif!","This is my third favorite Miyazaki film (under Spirited Away and Totoro) and though it is over 23 years old it trumps anthing disney's put out for a looong time! The charm of Lupin III and the absolutely wonderful pacing/flow of the action catch your attention from the first moment. It doesn't take itself to seriously but by the end every character has a place in your heart (especially Lupin III). In my veiw the animation style is perfect for the light theme and the backgrounds have excellent detale, especially in the castle.As a warning, I would warn parents away from the other Lupin III movies, as they have not been touched by Miyazaki magic (and turned to gold;) There is a little swearing and cigeret smoking in this one as well... but the pure fun within makes it perfect for anyone over 6.An excellent buy for the young and young at heart!"
4,Great caper film which happens to be anime.,"Monday, May 03, 2004 / 4 of 5 / Great caper film which happens to be anime. This was my first full length film exposure to the Lupin mythos. Long ago I had played the laser disc game `Cliffhanger' in the arcades when it first came out, it incorporated most of its plot and scenes from this movie. It was great to finally see the whole thing as I only ever made it about half way through the game, heh. Lupin and sidekick rob a casino and during the ensuing pursuit happen upon a princess chased by thugs. Ultimately leading back to a castle, a count, and a small country holding secrets to counterfeiting and beyond this was an excellent early anime with a great plot. It's interesting to see the character and stylistic cues later anime, particularly Cowboy Bebop, took from the Lupin saga. The plot was what surprised me the most, very sophisticated and entertaining for an anime, it was almost like an animated Bond film, or similar spy caper/mystery. Recommended."
1,"get the 'Manga Video' dvd release, instead","Right from the get-go, this version irked me. The introduction plays stilled images versus the [original] beautifully animated sequence. English translating, while not bad, forcefully swears quite a bit. Manga Video's dubbing may not be entirely clean but it was hardly bothersome.It is unfortunate that these issues ruined what is an otherwise great story."
5,Great fun,"The smooth, easy tempo of this off-beat adventure animation is really enjoyable. I learned Japanese by watching this and other Miyazaki films. It is certainly a great improvement over mindless repetition of unrelated syllables.Miyasaki's honorable thief weaves mystery, romance, intrigue in a simple and funny romp through anime. I watched it with a friend, but afterward just had to buy a copy of my own. Great fun."
4,Lupin!!!,"This Lupin movie was pretty good. It pretty much has all the charecters in it. But it dosen't very well show how cool they can be like in the t.v. and ova series does. Overall the animation is pretty good compared to the others. The story pulls you in and is pretty entertaining as usual. There is plenty of action including car chases, shoot outs, spying etc... there is alot of comedy which makes it hallarious and of course there is alot of Lupin. Lupin is what made me fall inlove with anime. He is like a smoother japanese Austin Powers hero kind a guy to me. Very good anime."
5,Even Better on DVD!!!!!!!,"This is THE best Anime (Japanese or otherwise) that I have ever seen. I first saw the Japanese VHS version 7 years ago when my wife had her video collection shipped from Japan. Getting it on DVD is a real treat as it can be viewed either with the original Japanese soundtrack (with or without English subtitles) or in dubbed English. The Japanese Lupin character's voice is a classic, so I would definitely recommend watching it in Japanese, as the dubbed version does not fully capture the mood (or the dialogue!) This is definitely a Five Star classic keeper!"
3,Super Reader,"This starts better than it finishes. Wulf is imprisoned, condemned to die for supposedly leading a troop of men to their deaths against The Slimy Ones, cthulhoid horrors from the Terrible East.At his trial, he would not say why. Now the king lies dying, his doctor reveals that he, too is a World Master wizard, and it is sorcery that ails him. The dying king calls for Wulf to go on the quest to find the Dark Lady.Wulf agrees rather than be lopped, and takes his prison companion with him, a highwaywoman, and the Doctor goes for sorcerous support.Sorcerous storms, mutant animals and slimy ones are passed to reach another kingdom of men, to their surprise, and the Dark Lady is there.Pretty much all downhill from there. Bewitching sorceress needs the strongest kind in the land to be superpowerful. Sort of a 2.75, this one.The setting is apparently some far future post-apocalyptic type world, much as Gemmell did later."
5,ENJOYABLE MOVIE,Saw this movie when it first came out and it was very entertaining. Its great to have it on DVD and to see it again after all these years.
3,Hold On,"If you are reviewing this dvd strickly as a movie than you wouldhave to agree that its rather poor. It makes HELP! look like Shakespear.However......if you take into account that its Herman's Hermits andthe nostaglia of it, than its a pretty good buy. I didnt get to see thismovie back in the 60's and was very curious about it. Its fun in aDon Knotts/Brady Bunch kind of way. I am glad I bought it."

5,Very good,"25 years ago I saw ""When the rain comes down"" video on TV for the first time. Unfortunately, I couldn't get the record for many reasons at that time and thereafter forgot about this song and the album either. But the impression remained for years. I was gladly surprised to having encountered it on Amazon. So now I got it. Perfect rock album!"
3,20 years later...,"This is still a pretty great rock record. Its defnitely dated and hasn't aged as well as wine but it has maintained its ability to rock. There are moments that make it clear that this record is 20 years old but at the same time... im still happy to sing along. It is what it is.. a catchy, rock record from a guitarist who just wanted to do more than The Reflex.. not that i have a problem with that. I love Duran Duran, too. But this record shows that the guitarist had more to offer. I'm glad he offered it up..."
1,Item did not come as described,I was charged for a single bowl not a set of 4. So I paid almost 20 for two small bowls because I ordered 2. As far as Fiesta is concerned it's the best you can get for everyday use.
1,not set of four!!!!,"I ordered two sets of these, was very excited about trying new colors of my favorite brand fiesta. Recieved one bowl of each set. Amazon's only recourse was return and refund. Very disapointed."
1,very tiny bowls,"These are not at all what I was expecting. To me, these are tiny bowls -- they measure 5 1/4 inches across top. [...]"
4,Loving it but where are the day students?,"I have visited the Higgins Classical Institute and find the description outstanding. I am enjoying reading about the history of the school as well as learning more about Charleston, Maine. My great grandfather was a farmer in Charleston, Me. He attended the Institute as did his five daughters. (my grandmother and aunts.) I was a bit disappointed however that the day students are not mentioned very much. The kids in the town (many of them farmer's children and not well to do) went free as I understand it. They too contributed to the historical value of the Institute. I would like to contact the author to see if she ran across the name Benjamin Dyer, or Roxanna Dyer in her research. I am not finished reading this book but am enjoying it."
2,CONDITION OF TACOS,THE TACOS SHELLS WERE MAINLY BROKEN. SHELLS ARE TOO THIN FOR TRANSPORTATION. THE SHELLS ARE VERY GOOD. MAINLY USE FOR DIPPING.
4,Missing pieces,"The set was in a great box and has worked well, however it came without anything to hold the pieces in the box. Sharp tips fall out of the box when you open it. We got magnetic tape and added it it to hold the pieces."
4,"Nice set of ""hobby knives""","Nice set of ""hobby knives"" for a great price. I bought the real Xacto set as I heard through the grapevine that off-brand sets were not as sharp, didn't hold up as well, and just were of poor quality overall. The price for these on Amazon is a bit less than in the local stores which makes it a great buy. I use these all the time to work on my RC plane and other odds and ends jobs around the house. Highly recommended."
4,perfect for the hobbyist!,"Lots of different cutting blades. Can be used to cut a variety of materials, wood, card and paper alike. Perfect tool or gift for a hobbyist."
5,This is a unique and wonderful must read!!,"Anyone with a love of history will appreciate this unique and engrossing historical peerspective. This first hand account of the naval experience in World War II contains well remembered reminiscences of the daily lives of these very young men. The author clearly possessed a unique sensitivity and insight into the hearts and minds of those he served with. This is not a ""blood and guts"" boot but a deeper exploration of the life and times. As you read it your emotions run the gamet from fear to relief, from tears to laughter. This book is well worth reading and contains wonderful pictures to boot! I loved it!!"
2,Not all memoirs should be written.,"Not all war stories are interesting, and this book is definite proof of that. This slim little tome is no bargain."
3,Read the licence carefully,"This software is probably a good value if you intend to use and keep it for a long time. Read the end user licence carefully. Autodesk license agreements prohibit the sale of license from person to person. The only exception would be when most of the assets of a company are sold to another company. If this does not concern you, great. If you're like me and want the option to resell in the future, not so great."
2,New User,"Since I am a new user with this software, I don't know if it's me or the program that is lacking something. Program states you can customize the size of paper you are using but I can't seem to get that to work. Also, what looks to be centered on screen does not print out that way.My old American Greetings program is so user friendly and this program is more like using a Photoshop program (too many bells and whistles) for a greeting card program. The only reason I purchased it was because of the custom paper sizing option."
4,Love it!,This product has as in the past editions show to be an excellent product. I am very pleased to have it. I love to be creative.
2,Can't print envelopes properly,Although this program does a nice job on cards forget it when printing envelopes. It won't print #10 at all and it won't preview or print some of the other sizes. So what good is a nice card if you can't get an envelope for it to go in.
1,Not a good purchase,I was very sorry that I purchased these. I put the little pebbles in the basket with my water plant and when I picked it up... the basket broke. We have many baskets in our pond but they are thicker and more sturdy. These were made very thin and are worthless. Sorry... but I speak truth. Not a good purchase.
4,"Hard reading, but mostly worth the effort","This is a rather dry and verbose but also careful and thorough financial and economic history.I particularly like his explanation of why there was a banking crisis in 1933. Most other authors seem confused about this crisis, but Wigmore explains how the hints that Roosevelt planned to devalue the dollar, combined with a system under which bank deposits were tied to paper dollars but could be withdrawn as gold, made it safer to hold gold than to leave one's money in a bank."
2,Lets It All Hang Out,"The boxers are comfortable but lack the standard button in front to keep everything secure while you're wearing them. The open gape is fine for sleeping, but you probably wouln't want to wear them out."
3,True to size/ Do not size up!,"I bought an XL for my 6'1"" 185lb husband to give to him on our honeymoon. I decided on the XL b/c of the numerous reviews I read about them running very small. He was swimming in them! This was not an inexpensive purchase for one pair of undees! The quality is very nice, but he never wears them b/c they're WAY TOO BIG. ( He requested I add it is unrelated to the ""size of his package"":)"
1,Not a quick detailer,As another buyer stated - THIS IS NOT A QUICK DETAILER - instead it is a cleaner/wax. It should not be called a quick detailer - BUYER BEWARE!
1,Buyer Beware!,"If you decide to buy a Wix filter, be sure to INSPECT it good before using it. I bought a flawed one and used it for many months before checking to see if it needed replacing. This is when I discovered that the pleats didn't reach the filter seal, allowing dirt to get past the filter.Wix is aware of the problem and has the filter in their possession, however the Company never offered to have my vehicle checked for damage, and didn't offer to replace or reimburse me for their poor quality."
1,Filters not working correctly,"The filters on the order screen doesn't work correctly in helping a novice person to determine if they are ordering the correct part for an automobile. The order form asked the year, model and make of my car, but the filter never changed. Therefore, the wrong filter arrived. Now I have to send back and pay shipping for the new and correct filter. I trust amazon, but I am a little disappointed with this item that I purchased and having to wait for the new one to arrive and pay shipping."
1,These DO NOT FIT the Sony CyberShot H7,I wish I could choose ZERO STARS for these. They DO NOT FIT the Sony CyberShot H7!!!
1,jack's daddy,"worthless. not even worth the paper it was printed on. this bunch of worthless ""spiritualism"" offered no actual suggestions on how i am to tolerate and ""live"" with my severe pain. basically i felt ""ripped off"" (which is how my entire life since childhood has been). i was left with a feeling the author only wanted to cram down my throat a bunch of religious bunk that i should be happy i'm alive & that i'm lucky to be living in a country where i have religious freedom. this item went directly into the trash. i'm still hurting ""head-to-toe"" with pain. not recommended. a true ""rip-off."""
5,great item,"To be perfectly honest, I originally bought this item thru mailorder strictly because of the cute container it came in (I had never heard of it or tried it). WOW, it's a great hand cream and everyone who sees it in my kitchen tries it and loves it. I've since bought more and given it as gifts. The hand soap has the same fresh clean scent and I'm hooked on that too! It's a bit pricey, but worth it."
2,You're So Cupid,"Brian Krause seems to have kept his ""Charmed Character of Leo"" in this movie. Too Bad, was looking forward to seeing him play a different character."
3,Teen Flick,"I bought this dvd for my 14 year old sister and she LOVED it! My mother liked it because it is a good, clean movie with a sweet story line that teaches a lesson. As a teenage boy on the other hand...not my type of movie. But perfect for tween and teenage girls and their mothers."
3,A little twist to the movie,This movie is a cute romantic teenage movie. It does have a twist to it that was unexpected. It is cute and not to intense.
5,Great,"When given as a gift, this product was really loved- so much that we bought another one for ourselves."
3,"good, but....","Very interesting, but towards the end, after the creation of Israel, the writing slants towards the left. I would think that a ""historical atlas"" should be impartial, but there is a definite left-wing bias."
3,"Nice Book, Too many opinions","This book is a nice map book with lots of interesting information. I was however very disappointed to see that the authors spend much time presenting various secular theories, and using scriptural interpretations with questionable accuracy. I expected that a book so short and concise would spend more time setting down the facts and less space giving analysis and opinions. I might just throw it out."
5,beautiful,My boots JUST arrived. It took 2 weeks but was sure worth the wait! They are absolutely gorgeous. Thanks to everyone who posted their positive remarks. I concur!
2,High pitched noise and hiss with USB,"It seems to work ok unless you need to put the sound through the USB. Once you do so, there's a high pitched noise and hiss that will come through on recordings. I Googled this issue, and it seems to be a common problem, especially on desktop computers. Laptops seem to have better luck. Apparently, there is a grounding issue with the USB. Aside from the high pitched noise and hiss, I couldn't get my bass to sound decent through the mixer. It sounded great on the headphones on the mixer but sounded awful after going through USB despite trying a myriad of settings. I am currently trying to return this."
2,High-pitched hiss through USB,"I bought this on a recommendation from a friend. First I noticed over at his house a high pitched hiss when we were playing around with his setup. I thought at the time maybe this was something in his computer somewhere.Then I got mine, and lo and behold, the same problem! This hiss only occurs through the USB interface. When I ran it through an M-Audio Mobile Pre USB, no hiss. I Googled this and there are numerous reports of people having this problem. This is not an isolated incident. I don't do many Amazon reviews. I only take the time to do this one to say ""buyer beware.""So if you are looking to use the USB interface, consider another product, because you are just going to have to sink another $30-$100 on an audio interface to connect to your PC. If you don't need USB, this seems like a perfectly fine mixer. It just annoys me to buy a something only to find that one of its main features is completely broken."
1,SUCKS!!!!,"This mixer is terrible. I have had two of them. The first one I bought worked for the first day then it didn't the next day. Okay..I thought. Maybe it was a fluke...a manufacturer's defect. I sent it off to Alesis and they sent me a new one. Same thing happened. I got it on a Friday night. I plugged it in on Friday, and Saturday morning it didn't work when I booted my cpu up. Now unless there is some insane trick that I have to do to get this to work, this mixer only works one time on the first day. If you buy one, don't turn your computer off. Don't turn the mixer off. As a matter of fact don't go to sleep or else it might stop working.I should have bought the Behringer."
2,Not what is pictured,"Beware: You will not receive a PRO bar, like both the picture and item description say. You will instead receive a Double Guard bar, like the 105700 is supposed to include (according to Oregon's website). Still not a bad deal, but not as good as getting a Pro bar in the combo."
5,Love It!!,"My sister and I have been looking for this for YEARS--I was especially happy to be able to get it on DVD!It works perfectly, and I absolutely couldn't beat the price. Thank you!"
3,Nature photography collection,"This book was published in 1999, and oh boy how did time change the scene of publishing nature photography.With developments like BBC's Life films and Mittermeiers/ CEMEX book publications there is a lot of the highest quality Natural history publishing in the last decades. Nature scenery becoming scarcer and its imagery being valued higher as times go by.This is an ok collection considering the above. At the time it was the avant garde in imagery with the likes of Lanting, but compared to what is available today it is perhaps a little dated."
2,pictures good not great. not a well put together book,"I'm glad I borrowed this book thru interlibrary loan first rather than buying it outright. The photos are quite nice but not organized in a way that's very informative or give me a good idea about any of the ""edens"". There's pretty minimal text which might offer the contributor's views on what they photographed and give interesting backstories.I suppose its a personal preference and if you want an random assortment of pretty good animal pictures, its not bad at all, but I find it unappealing."
4,buy it if you have some enemy,this book is cool and dangerous! it' the best i have ever read about mines! be carefull and keep your childrens away!
3,"Not as good as ""At Risk""","Not as good as ""At Risk"" but it is still a good book and it really starts to heats up in the last chapters, can't wait to read the next two books and see what Cline gets himself into next."
3,Accurate horse-y details,"The most rewarding aspect of Kit Ehrman's books is the accuracy of the horse details. Nothing is more excrutiating than reading about the ""palomino with the long, flowing black fetlock"". ;)The story was well-crafted and suspenseful. But for whatever reason the main character hasn't really grabbed me yet, even after reading the first two offerings in the ""Steve Cline"" series."
3,Good Story - Too much blasphmy,I enjoyed the story. Steve Cline takes a huge amount of punishment for what seems to be other peoples problems. And the background of stable management is very interesting.I say a prayer each time I encounter a blasphemous word which breaks up the story line.Overall a good read.
5,Awesome book - It really works!,As an office worker I suffer from the kind of back pain that comes from sitting in the same basic position for 8 hours a day - every day. I've got a great chair. I sit ergonomically correct. I just think God didn't design the human body to sit in front of a computer all day long!The stretches presented in this book have been extremely effective at eliminating this pain.I highly recommend this book to anyone that works at a computer and suffers from this type of repetitive stress pain.
2,"No Axe Grinding and Poor Organization, Thank You.","I set out to read this with anticipation. After all it came recommended and is put out by Oxford University Press. But this book was a big disappointment.I had trouble keeping track of the threads and the plots as I read. Eventually, I figured out the fault is not all mine. There's no getting around it -- the book is poorly organized. I felt like I was trying to decipher an overly complicated but sloppily written soap opera upon watching it for the first time.In addition, it engages in blatant axe-grinding. I'm still shaking my head over it calling Edward VI ""the boy bigot."" That opened my eyes to axe-grinding elsewhere in the book. That added a lack of credibility to its lack of organization.So this is one book I won't bother to finish."
3,Good ideas,"The video gave many good ideas for things kids can do at home. It is dated though.The seller I bought from provided a copy that was stamped from a library so I plan to donate it to my public library, hopefully the video will find it's way home."
4,Bowling shoe review,Like the shoe. Have bowled for 41 years and wore Linds before this purchase. Didn't know how much longer I would be bowling and didn't want to spend a lot for shoes. These are every bit as comfortable for me as the Linds. Not a stiff shoe and sliding foot easily adapted to the approach conditions. Am extremely happy with this purchase.
4,Amazing Story - Revisited....,"..having read the superb book ""the hurricane"",i wanted to know more of this remarkable man's story,his autobiography did not disappoint.reading his own words convey the powerful emotions one can only begin to imagine when your world is shattered by life imprisonment for a crime you did not commit.mr. carter's writings of his childhood up to his wrongful imprisonment paint a graphic picture of the forces that mold us, he was by no means a model citizen, but then, who of us are.i found the spirit of this man extraordinary,i hope that the visibility his life story has received of late, will in some way compensate him. but for the many years stolen, there is no repayment.i found both ""the 16th round"" and ""the hurricane"" great reading, for they fill in the gaps for each other. fyi: ""the 16th round"" can be had from penguin books out of canada."
4,great story,"This a great story.please ""game of fools"" by charles wooten the story of glenn summerford who is still in prison doing a 99 year sentence ffrom a case like hurricanes that consisted of predujuice and lies."
4,Purchased as a gift,I bought this as a gift for my aunt. She loves the book. She is an avid reader of unusual books and specifically mentioned this one. So I got it for her.
5,Can't wait,"Hi I have never wanted a book as bad as I want this one. The first time i have ever hear of the""HURRICANE"" was the movie. I saw this movie and it grabbed me, pulled me in i couldn't spot watching it. I even put up a punching bag because of it. After I saw the movie I did a little research on Rubin and learned AMAZING things. So I came on amazon looking for the book I put in an order for it and can't wait to get. And once I read other peoples reviews I knew I wanted it. So now I sit and wait, butg if it is as intresting as every one says it will be worth it. I hope you find this review helpful and inspire you to read this book."
3,FAIR,"I found that this review was fair, but I would rather read the whole contexts of this book myself; before I can really say what I thought about this book. One thing I know for sure, this book comes highly recommended. So because of this I would like to purchase it for myself when the time comes."
1,Too bad this is probably mostly hype,"I saw the movie and the facts here are even more distorted than the movie. Frankly I couldn't read all of this, but wanted to compare the two so I skimmed some of it. I read extensively in the news accounts from both sides of this story and there is very compelling evidence that he did commit murder, there is a lot of made up stuff in this book as there was in the movie. Things are bad enough without a lot of lying like this to exaggerate it. This is a violent guy and the book at least does nothing to dispute that much. In an odd way it is a good read because it is so intense, but a lot of it is fantasy."
5,The Sixteenth Round: No 1 Contender to Superb Writer,"This book is incredible! I've already read Hurricane: The Miraculous Journey by J.S. Hirsch, and Lazarus and the Hurricane, but in England it is extremely difficult to find this book, and I had to wait 18 days for the it to me. It was definately worth the wait. Being only 16, I don't often enjoy reading, but this story just reels you in and I rarely put it down. Rubin Carter: what an inspiration! Read it! It is definately worth it, especially when you think that it was written 30 years ago."
5,brilliant and shocking,To read a true 20th century tradgedy look no farther. an ispiration as it really happened. i loved the message of what we can overcome if we set out to do so. Amazing as it shows the very best and the very worst in human nature and i recommend it for all mature readers. it can be graphic and disturbing but it gets the point across.
3,The Sixteenth Round: From Number 1 Contender To #45472,"The Sixteenth Round: From Number 1 Contender To #45472. I had been looking forward to receiving this book as i have been searching for a copy (that i could afford!) for quite some time. It was shipped over from USA in one piece, in about 4 weeks which i though was quite good. The condition was good as suggested, no missing or damaged pages. There were a couple of sticky looking marks on the cover, but nothing that i can't clean up.Over all a happy customer, looking forward to reading!"
4,Makes you Think...,"I found this book at the library, where I was number 16 on the list to borrow it. (Ironic, huh?) It was a really easy read, although the courtroom drama got to be a bit much and I skipped a good part of that. I finished the book being certain of Carter's innocence, but there were still parts of me that wondered exactly what he left out of the book -- many times I got the feeling that an editor had purposely rewritten Carter's words. For instance, Carter suddently goes gun-ho Muslim, with a new name and all, and ten pages later it's forgotten and never mentioned again, with no explaination. Still, a great read and a good companion after seeing the movie."
3,"Innocent, but still responsible","The book is okay...but I will admit I had a tough time rooting for this guy. Each and every problem were to some degree caused by his own behavior. And his failure to take responsibility for his own behavior turned me off.He was clearly framed, but his own actions, criminal record, and words are part of what led to his being framed. I was disappointed that he failed to recognize this fact."
2,The rounds go on and on...,"I purchased this book, after viewing the much celebrated movie, ""The Hurricane."" The book is mediocre. I found it difficult to believe much of the writer's exaggerated boasting regarding his many talents. I had erroneously gathered from the movie, that this was a self-effacing, self-made man, not so. The reader is ever searching for the ""real meat"" of the story, however, the bulk of the story is about the author as a ""ghetto-bad boy."" The last few chapters of the book are short and quickly race you through the actual murder and trial. Overall it is not well written and disappointing."
3,A Critical Approach to Discernment,"Taylerson takes an academic approach to discernment in the Catholic Christian's life in ""I Come To Do Your Will."" He reflects on historical perspectives on discernment, including Catherine of Sienna and Saint Ignatius. He draws from Old Testament and New Testament stories of discerning God's will. The book is structured into a series of reflections.While the content of this slim volume possess a certain depth and academic flavor, it neglects the aspects of inspiration. Taylerson writes that inspiration is the first step in discernment for the Virgin Mary, and presumably, for Christians. This book is not written to be inspirational. Instead, it possesses an analytical quality and tone. The occasional stories mixed in with the content keep it from being completely dry."
4,Stangers,Both stories in this book are well written. They are a little hard to get started reading because it more thought process than talking. I do enjoy reding Lisa Jackson.
5,Thriller! Page Turner! Awesome read!,"This book was just an awesome read, because it is 2 stories wrapped into one novel. These stories of Lisa Jackson's have to be the most suspensful I've read so far. This book was an excellent read on the beach, and I would definently recommend this novel to anyone who loves Lisa Jackson's work!!"
4,Use for Siding of Hands and Feet,"I've had no problems underlining in pencil with this book. either underline lightly or place a piece of cardstock between the pages. despite the fact that a lot of bone features are ignored, it is worth the price to buy it used just for the siding of the carpals, metacarpals, phalanges, tarsals, metatarsals, and pedal phalanges.In our human skeletal analysis lab we have at least 4 texts, including this one. Each one is lacking something the other has. It seems common for these types of texts. I've had to buy this book, and another, in addition to the required text for the course just to cover all aspects about osteology (except pathology, which is covered in a book that costs 180 bucks).That said, if you're a physical anth major, you'll probably need more than one book anyway, since we need to know every feature on each individual bone."
1,never recieved,They never shipped my book and refused to give me a refund. Now Im out 50.00 and still don't have the book i need for class!
4,"Concise, almost too much so.","A concise little history that only whets the appitite of what awaits in the three volume history. If you want to know the bare facts that march through a 1000 years of history, this is the book. If you want a more detailed exploration of the culture, try the longer version."
3,Read the long one!,"I began reading the Short History of Byzantium but soon became both frustrated and tantalized by the skipping-along-in-history that was necessary in order to condense a three-voume work into one. I have just purchased Volume I and am really enjoying it. I compared some passages between the two versions and found that, as I suspected, a lot of the material that made this history interesting and coherent had been left out in the condensation. It shouldn't take too much longer to read the whole thing, and you'll understand and remember a lot more."
5,A Romantic View of a Glorius Forgotten Empire,"Lord Norwich has done a fantastic job with this book. Though it may not be the most indepth, it does give the reader a wonderful introduction to what the often forgotten empire of Byzantium. The reader is introduced to a cast of characters unriveled in any historical work, men like Justinian and Constantine the Great. This book is unforgettable from the moment you begin reading. Lord Norwich removes much of the unfair criticisim laid on the Later Roman Empire, by its chief detractor Edward Gibbon. He exposes the emperors for what most of them were decent upright people trying to stay alive in a rough world. His moving epilogue to the fall of Constantinople is also one of the best I have ever had the pleasure of reading. For anyone interested in the true history of the Roman empire this book is a must read."
5,I am stunned that I was never taught of Byzantium in school.,"READ THIS BOOK! You will never regret it. This book is a stunning, eloquent, entertaining, and enjoyable look at an empire that is the sole reason for the survival of Western civilization.Byzantium was a pivotal hub around which the Holy Roman Empire, the Bulgars, Vandals, Persians, Crusaders, Arabs, and others rotated. By reading this book, you will enjoy an incredibly clear view of the history of Western Europe, Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Asia Minor, and the common threads of human activity that weave throughout.Norwich has my undying admiration and thanks for taking the magnificent subject and turning it into such an enjoyable voyage of discovery. Thank you, Mr. Norwich....Thank you."
4,Bravo...Byzantium,"Accolades to Lord Norwich for his interesting account of the ""Eastern Empire"". The author does a fantastic job of blending strong historical research with interesting snippets of Byzantine folk lore. This is a must read for anyone who cherishes history and good writing."
3,A bit disappointed,"Being not an expert on Byzance history, I can not fairly realized how much J. Norwich succeeds to bring back to the surface from our ocean of forgotten history. He may do well on that point except maybe that his history looks more as an apology to all Byzantium emperors and leaders and seems to forget part of the history that I was more eager to know: economy, society and culture. We may not know well these subjects, and written traces might speak more about the dramas of the emperial families than about the state of the people. But on that specific point, I was a bit disappointed. Still an interesting book."
3,"Standard, Fast-Moving Poltical/Military History","A Short History of Byzantium is aptly-named. It covers over a thousand years of history in 381 pages. As such, it is necessarily short on depth and contains no analysis--or footnotes for the serious historians. More concerning to me, however, was its lack of any material beyond male military leaders and emperors. There is no cultural history, a little religious history, and the presentation of the few women in the book is a joke. Casual readers will probably won't be bothered, but anyone with a serious interest in history should read the original three volume work and be prepared to supplement it with additional works."
3,400 pages isn't enough,"I have to agree that this is just too short for Byzantine's long history. What comes out as a result is a whole series of ""x emperor died because y killed him"" and such, with little detail. The book is well written, and I think I will go read the 3 volume history instead."
2,"Shorter, but not better","Don't short-change yourself. Read the three volume original, if you can find it in the library. What you lose in brevity, you gain in insight."
3,Old-Fashioned History,"Getting more than 1000 years of history into a modestly sized book is something of an achievement. But Norwich's book accomplishes this task by leaving out what is most important to most contemporary historians: the realities of Byzantine life. Norwich focuses almost exclusively on that tiny minority of political and religious leaders-very much a ""great man"" view of history. We learn almost nothing of the lives of ordinary people. We are totally in the dark about the arts, philosophy, and technology of the Byzantines.The writing is at best only adequate. IF you are looking for a rich history of the more cultural aspects of Byzantium, this is NOT it. Norwich is very much of the ""old school."""
2,Old fashioned and trivial,"Perhaps the shortcomings of this book are due to the fact that it's an abridgement of a three-volume work, but I'm not so sure. I found it to be extremely tedious and very old fashioned. It is merely a catalog of events with strong doses of the salacious and a great deal of ""looking down the nose"" opinion.There is absolutely no analysis and no sense of what the events meant for their own time and for the future. It is firmly rooted in a very old fashioned, indeed 19th-century British, approach to history. I'm very sorry I wasted my money and enough time to decide it wasn't worth reading on it."
4,Great Read...Now Where's the Trilogy?,"I'm weirdly fascinated by the Byzantine Empire and I found this book a perfect way to get a fairly in depth introduction to Byzantium. It touches upon most, if not all, the most important topics and players without dwelling on any of them too long. But while this is fine, I found that after awhile, the various leaders, political figures and the like breezed by so quickly that it was hard to get a firm grasp on the topic as a whole. What a surprise when I went back to read Mr. Norwich's own introduction (a High School English teacher once told me to always read the intro to a book AFTER you've read it because it will make more sense) and found that he makes the exact comment that if the reader finds the characters going by too quickly, ""the trilogy awaits"". But I've not been able to find it.Great book...fast, solid reading. Not boring.."
2,STICKY MESS!,Taste great but the cap on the bottle doesn't seal very well so when it is shipped they leak. You can not take it with you without putting it in another container.
4,Great for diabetics,"My husband is diabetic and has been using this product for some time now. It really has made a change in keeping his blood sugar from spiking since this sweetener is low glycemic. We use it to sweeten drinks, on pancakes, on oatmeal, etc.Wholesome Sweeteners Organic Blue Agave, light, 23.5-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 6)"
4,"so far, so good",we've been using this for about a month.i put it in iced tea almost daily.we really like it.i am not positive that it's 1.5 times sweeter than sugar like they say...so i have used more than i thought i would.
1,Not! Don't be fooled by this sweetner.,"This sweetner is over rated by all, its not good for diabetics and it is refined although claims to be natural and unrefined & low GI. Just as bad a high fructose corn syrup especially for diabetics. I stopped using after reading about this sweetner on mercola.com Please get educated about this miracle sweetner that isn't. Better to use real sugar if you are not diabetic and if you are diabetic as I am, try the IDEAL sweetner sold here on Amazon which I love. Don't let the agave nectar alliances fool you into thinking its the best sweetner out in the market with claims of being great for diabetics and its a slow digested sweetner because it is not and if you wonder why your sugar is up after using it, its the agave."
1,Beware the after effects,"I recently tried this product to see how it compares to honey, I put honey on my pancakes and waffles as a slow glycemic alternative to syrup. The Blue Agave was posted at a lower price in the store and I wanted to give it try.After trying it, I found that I was still tasting and smelling agave the day after I used it and the following 24 hours as my body excreted the agave much like garlic is excreted. It was the strangest sensation to smell and taste it so strongly the day after using it. I can only guess they process it similar to alcohol which is also excreted from the human body. Beware of this side effect if you use it as a syrup alternative."
4,Wonderful sweetener substitute,"First off, I have to thank Amazon for getting this product to me. My shipment got lost in the mail (sent via 2-day shipping), and Amazon overnighted me another shipment no questions asked. The product itself is very good. I use it mostly to sweeten green tea, and it has a very light flavor. I tried it in my coffee, and it worked very well I recommend this to anyone interested in a natural, healthier way to sweeten drinks or bake."
5,Excellent Book,A great book to help people identify what they are looking for when they are dating. I can honestly say that this book should be mandatory for people prior to dating! :)
2,Could have used a disclaimer,"I ordered this book and only upon receiving it did I realize that it was written from a Christian perspective. I think a disclaimer would have been useful: Warning - God-Based, or something like that. This guy, upon discovering his daughter has just had her period, goes out and buys her a rose and a card ""containing a statement she could use as a budding woman in service to God.""Is that creepy, or is it just me?Anyway, I think the book is completely hopeless."
3,bhangra knights,"like Punjabi MC i cant help like this type of music, i heard it on a Peugeot advert first then on tv and it is catchy too I don't know why but i think this is good"
2,Just plain wrong ...,"Prospective readers should be aware that this book promotes the long-discredited psychoanalytic view of autism as an emotional disturbance. Full of bizarre interpretations which have remarkably little to do with the subjective experience of autism as described in first-person accounts such as those by Temple Grandin. Interesting enough in its way, but nothing to do with autism."
1,disturbingly wrong view of autism as the parent's fault,"Avoid this book! Tustin again goes down that dusty trail of blaiming the parent for the child's autism, this time for the parent being too needy and clinging."
1,Just hope nothing goes wrong,"I purchased this for my 15 year old grandson for Christmas.This is a semi-automatic. He played with it once, it seemed to be ok. Next time out he had to cock it each time.I tried to return it but because of the C02 its against the law to ship it back. I was'nt aware of that, so I'm just giving you heads up if anything should go wrong. Your stuck with it."
2,re-hash,"i hate it when bands follow up an album with the same album...and thats just what billy talent did. the production and tone is exactly the same as the first, making this cd somewhat boring and predictable. i had high hopes for this cd...i'm pretty disappointed."
2,Red Flag,"The only song that I really liked on this album was Red Flag. I heard the song on a late night show and thought that it would be a more punk rock album. It turns out that it is more emo, which I hate."
3,"A good album, not as revolutionary as everyone says.","This was a good album, with new, cool-sounding music. A good vocal style helped it along too. But this album is being hailed as revolutionary, even though it is not. Really, it's actually pretty generic.So, it's a good album that is being over-hyped by its fans."
1,What Have You Become?,"A good majority of the people here and elsewhere will have you believe that ""II"" is a quality extension of Billy Talent's self-titled debut. THAT couldn't be further from the truth. The energy, atmosphere and character of Billy's debut is all but absent on ""II"", leaving behind and in it's place over-production and spotty songwriting. If the ballad were going out of style, Billy Talent was that first to be notified, with over half of ""II"" being filled with just that; ballads. Aside from that, ""worker bees"" is probably the worst song I've ever heard in my entire life.Billy Talent are capable of better, that much is evident from their debut. Let's just hope album number 3 turns down the production and blasts out the energy. ""II"" is not worth your time."
3,another punk goes pop-punk,"If you loved their first cd, this one might let you down. If you thought their first cd was too edgy & screamy, you might love this one.Their first cd really seemed to embrace the original brittish screechy punk rock that was typical of bands like The Sex Pistols, blur, (etc). It was so different from all of the other pop punk that has been going around. I was, originally, a bit surprised by the sound & found it refreshing.This CD is much more mainstream. I think it is a little sad to see them go from something unique to something more mainstream. Some may chalk it up to maturity. Perhaps they have outgrown their anger & sorrow.I put this cd on the shelf and went back to their original cd."
5,Awesome!!!!!!!!!,"I pride myself in saying that I like every kind of music, but the first time I heard Billy Talent was in Burn Out Revenge, It gave all the edge I needed. So I decided to check the Cd out, IT""s AWESOME, I find myself amaze because come on I'm a POP HEAd my favorite singer it's Kylie Minogue, but these guys gave me that punk fix that I need... ONe of the best albums I heeard since Kylie's X....."
3,More of a personal study that erotica,"This book is not really erotica at all, though I suspect that some readers who are interested in Victorian style femdom might fine it more physically stimulated than I did. No, instead it is a journey of one man whom after a long life finally writes down his fantasies along with accompanying drawings. The drawings are well done though I bit difficult to see -- the nature of the media I suspect. The book itself is not a novel in the sense that it is actually a story of a particular length but instead more like a short story or a draft of what could have developed into an intriguing world. As it is, the development of the characters is too quick, too short, and thus I never empathized with anyone nor truly cared what happened to them. I found that I was more interested in the man that created this book, why these fantasies, why these images, why did it take so long for him to express himself and did he ever get that fantasy even briefly in real life."
1,Difficult to use Software,"My objective in purchasing this scanner was to be able to place a scanned photo on the same page as some text. After several sessions,I have not found a solution. Scanning is not the problem; rather, sending a scanned image to another application such as word so that one can combine a word document with the image. The software gives no clue and reaching Epson's technical support is a joke. Consider another brand. I'm selling or giving this one away."
2,Not Compatible with Intel Macs and OS 10.5,"The driver for this Epson 3200 scanner is built on PowerPC architecture. While it will work for some applications on an Intel based Mac, there are many Intel based applications with which this scanner will NOT work on a Mac, unless Epson updates the scanner driver. This is unlikely to happen because Epson wants customers to buy newer models of its scanners. If you own this scanner and use an Intel Mac with OS 10.5, you're out of luck. It will not work with most Adobe applications, as well as others."
3,they were ok,"They arrived on time....the pens are nothing special....regular black pen with narrow handle, I have most of then to co workers"
5,Connected me to my past,"The author transported me back into history, to the time and place and mindset of my Jewish grandmothers (one born in Russia, one born in the U.S.) and their antecedents. My grandmothers died when I was quite young (I am 62), so I didn't have the opportunity to question them personally about their daily lives, their struggles, and motivations and only had the family lore to go by. The same few stories were recycled endlessly. Now, reading this book, I feel as if I understand and appreciate them all the more for what they witnessed, accomplished, and preserved. I feel their strength and their triumphs coursing through my mother to me to my own daughters, and it makes me feel proud. Thank you Sydney Stahl Weinberg."
5,"Wow, so many classic songs in one place!","I got this box set for my birthday from my daughter and was so eager to open it up and start listening. i have most of these sings but on old vinyl records, they sound so good on CD remastered. I'm really happy i have the collection in one place and the liner notes are fabulous. So many interesting tidbits from my era. The reason to buy this set is also because of the outtakes and demos. it's really cool to hear the raw versions of these songs. I can't praise this enough, i think i'm going to get it for my mother for her birthday."
3,Pricey,"I bought this to go with the 6' miter table even though they are unbelievably expensive. I thought it would be assembled correctly. When I set it on my miter table, I noticed immediately that the bolt holes that go through the wooden piece, were not aligned correctly when drilled so the stop sits at quite an angle on the table. It decreases the thickness of wood you can use with it. Again, for the money, should have been perfect. I could have spent a whole lot less. Zero help from Delta e-mail. Disappointed!"
3,Motorola Technician programming use.,"I use a Dell D810 Latitude that lost it's serial port. I haven't had the time to disassemble the laptop to repair the serial port so I ordered this adapter. It works on most programming software except older software that will not go to the higher serial port settings like com port 11. Otherwise, it works great and has the added advantage of being a hot swappable port with the USB connection."
3,A good read,"I just loaned this book to someone who is visiting Nova Scotia on vacation. I have read it a couple of times. It's a good introduction to Halifax history and I think has a real feel for the flavor of the city. The explosion scenes are fascinating. On the other hand, the ending is a bit weak and some of the author's passages about the future of Canada seem a little outdated now."
2,Passable book,"I had to read this book for english class. It isn't all that great, it's too melodramatic at some point and too classic. The only good one is the character of Colonel Wain which is an interesting one because of it complexity."
1,barometer rising,I found this book very hard to get into. Our grade 12 english teacher picked it for a comprehensive novel study.I think that things just moved way too slow for my liking. It had a good story line but because of the nature it was writen in I would not recomend it to anyone.
1,Might want to do an author background check ...,"Interesting information on one of the authors, Ayers, can be found here:http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/years/2008/0710081ayers1.html"
5,Original,"This book helped inspire me to write ""Stalkers: The Resurrection."" The first novel, ""The Dream,"" was my favorite novel in the ""Year of the Cat"" trilogy. Zoe Daniels does an amazing job of stringing you along with the storyline, anxiously awaiting the next romantic moment between the main character, and Alex. I found myself routing for her the entire time."
5,"Mysterious, heart chatching and dreamy!!","I loved this book it gave you the pleasure of being some one else and living in a fantsy world. the charecters are so real and so dangerusly exciting that you'll want to read this book over and over. Or read the sequals. My favriot part was the one with Alex sarandon ( any girls dream) he was dangerus and alluring, and so is this book. :)"
1,Horrid,"Is it me, or do all these women writers for teenage erotic novels sound the same? Maybe it's all written by the same people! Or maybe it's capitalism that drives them or something.This little ditty is about a new girl who has found out that she has powers beyond belief (wow). She can turn into a cat! And not just any cat either, it's the big ones. Oh yeah, and there's a subplot about her inner desires. This story echoes so much to L.J. Smith far more superior (but still inferior) ""The Secret Circle"" mini-series in the fact that there are the *exclusive* group of people with *power* and then there are the outsiders. And there's the protagonist that's both insider and outsider. But the ""Year of the Cat"" is so conrived from another contrived story (it's like Stone Temple Pilots ripping off Pearl Jam ripping off old seventies bands) that it's sickening."
1,Not even good enough for a toilet book,"I found ""The Year of the Cat"" boring, predictable and unoriginal. There are just too many plotlines going around like a cheap soap opera. The only thing that lead me to read it was the front cover and fancy words synopsis on the back. Great cover art illustration but bad quality writing"
1,Just one question,"If they worship an egyptian cat and tigress goddess, why do they turn into panthers which don't even exist in Egypt?"
3,Cute but not the best fit,"I thought the price was great for this pair of Charles David sandals. Loved the heel height too. However, the straps rubbed my pinky toe in a weird way. I knew this was going to cause pain in the long run, so back they went. I order 1/2 size up, which I think was fine, but the orientation of the straps didn't work for my foot."
3,For narrow feet,This shoe was way too narrow for my foot. Lengthwise it seemed 1/2 size too small. I wanted it to work because the heel height was lower and it's hard to find evening shoes with a lower heel. However the straps were too tight and there was no way it would be comfortable for me.
4,Gcc now handles key set of languages,"Given the the author of this book wrote the original gcc, and has been closely involved with its development in the intervening years, you can safely regard the book as definitive.Stallman clearly is writing for someone already familiar with C. Very little of your time is wasted by wading through elementary material.When I first used gcc years ago, it was just that: strictly for compiling C programs. But Stallman and other developers have dramatically expanded the scope. Now, the book describes how gcc can handle a key set of languages - the original (ANSI) C, C++, Fortran and Java. The set of C, C++ and Fortran probably spans most engineering and scientific legacy applications. Terrific value!"
3,Not what I was looking for,"Over half of the manual was a descrition of the many command line parameters. If I were using it in a unix environment or developing my own GUI interface for it, it would be useful. Otherwise..."
2,Fact to consider,"The weight is too heavy, I wish I would have chosen a light weight Stethoscope, It is something to consider if you have a large patient load and are wearing it around your neck for any length of time."
3,Not sure,I was quite dissapointed with this book. Lots of repeats and the general style is for dummies. I bought this because of the high reviews but did not find it very usefull.
5,Must have book for enlightning your problem solving skills,I bought this one for interview preparation since most companies ask questions which are variations of the problems and solutions given in this book. Apart from that this book is sitll a good read to refresh problem solving skills.
3,Great book,"Very great concepts, but the language is a little dry and it is difficult to keep up the readers interest. Great concepts though - a must read for interview prep..."
2,Brief and cursory,"It's a collection of lessons appropriate for college students, nothing more. If you've seen your fair share of sorts and trees, don't feel pressured by my fellow reviewers into thinking this book is some sort of essential programmers' bible.The advice so highly praised here is borderline commonsensical: ask why you need to change code before you do it, get as many specification details as you can before you start a project, consider running times and minimizing the amount of data you need to use.Pearls is short on content for us non-newbies."
3,Book of stories,"The book wa interesting to me as the collection of stories about programming and problems that programer can meet in his work. the solutions in the book are brilliant.On the other hand, I don't lik that book treats some very specific problem areas, which are unconnecet mutually. Secondly, there are many things in this book which are completely out of date. I don't want to say that they are completely unimportant, but there are things in modern programming that are much more important and in wich you can improve your program much more.I read this book, as I said before, as collection of funny and interesting stories."
2,For Absolute Beginner Programmers,"This book is really addressed towards absolute beginner programmers. Maybe if you've only taken an introductory course or two at college, or just have the syntax of one language under your belt and want a broader perspective this book will be useful.If you have any experience, the examples are all very mundane. (E.g. ""this is what a minheap is""). If you have just finished reading a ""Learn [Language] in 24 hours!"" type book, I guess this wouldn't be a bad follow up. Otherwise, steer clear."
1,"Good topic, very poor language","I was really puzzled by some of the language in this book. Many books use example from real life to make a problem easily understood. But this book uses real example to complicate the problem. Many problems in this book can be summarized or formulated by concise and easily understood sentences. But this book use examples to make the problem complicate. Sometimes I feel that I have walked a long way to reach what I can reach by one step after reading the verbose examples; sometimes I just want to say ""what at hell are you talking about""."
1,ugh,this by far is the worst movie i have ever seen in my 23 years of living lmfao the guy who played the creeper needs not to act ever again omg lmfaoooooooooooo
4,decent movie,"I'm a big stephanie powers fan. So even though this movie is probably considered to be ""low budget,"" I think it is a good one."
2,I would give 2.5 stars if I could,"I did finish it, so that's something to say. I was a pleasant story, though unfortunately entirely predictable. The cast of characters is not all that entertaining or even likable. It was an easy read, but I would recommend Carole Matthew's 'Chocolate Lover's Club' over this one."
3,"this was okay, but not her best","I agree with the other reviewer, lots of situations were left unexplored. The other books I have read by this author didn't have multiple, interacting story lines like this book did. It was a quick, fun read but not the best Carole Matthews' book in my opinion."
3,Striving for Grace,"In the Company of Trees was obviously written with great humility. In this book Mr. Mortier revives my fond recollections of Vermont in the 60s and 70s and just what it meant to be twenty-something, innocent and determined to shed the assumptions of a big-city upbringing. I was grateful for this book's ability to remind me of those days when we were so determined to become competent and of the projects that desire led to us initiate."
4,Works fairly well,These clamps were purchased for light weight work making wooden ship models. They are very light and appear to be durable. They use a friction device to hold themselves closed- which works most of the time.You can also take them apart and use them to push things apart instead of clamping if you have the desire.I wish I could find a better clamp that was small and lightweight and had a positive machanism to hold it in place instead of friction- but these will work until that magic device appears.
1,"Poor Quality, despite claims",This product contains flimsy materials. The handle bends as you try to push a 18 pound one year old child. The wheels do not spin well and scratch wood floors. For the price it is a rip-off. Maybe $40 would be more reasonable.The assembly of this is crazy. There must be 50 parts and the directions are of poor quality.If you try to call the USA service center you get a recorded message stating that the Injusa products are no longer supported but you can BUY replacement parts. Essentially there is no warranty in the USA.Please note that once you purchase it you will likely not be able to return if without paying an arm and leg (From Great Deals and Offers)Buyer Beware.
1,spotty scanning,"I bought the Epson 3200 Photo scanner and had problems with spotting of images scanned in the upper right hand corner of the scanning bed. After exchanging the first unit, I had the same problem with the replacement, which I returned for a refund. I would not recommend this model scanner to anyone. Shop elsewhere."
2,Gibson Grip Brush,"I would not recommend this product. The brush is very small which is ok, but youre not getting a great quality for the price. The bristles are starting to wear down after just a few months. Go buy a better and cheaper brush from your local hardware store!"
5,great iron boost,"I purchased this because my hemoglobin got extremely low after the birth of my baby. I was so weak that I could barely walk to the next room without feeling faint for a whole week postpartum. I started taking 1/2 teaspoon of this 3-4 times a day and was up walking around the house quite freely in just a couple of days. The taste is not bad, and it is non-constipating! I definitely recommend this to anyone needing a good iron supplement!!"
5,Great back support!,"I bought this for a friend of mine, and she was really impressed with the back support that this bra offers, she would recommend it to anyone. It came well packaged, no issues what so ever."
5,Trouble with bra straps always slipping off your shoulder?,"Constantly pulling my bra straps back on my shoulder drives me crazy! After trying this bra, I was was ""hooked."" The light padding allows you to wear any type of fabric. The underwire adds support and its cut low enought in the front to wear lower necklines."
5,Fool For Love,"The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting to get different results. We learn of Eddie, Mae, their father, and a ""Man"" (Martin) coming for a date blind to the status of the relationship of his date and her brother and their father. I am a Senior at Lindenwood University in St. Charles Missouri, double majoring in Theatre and Mass Communications. This April, I will be directing ""Fool For Love"" as my senior project. This play, as analyzed in a previous modern drama class and in my current working analysis, is highly identifiable with anyone who has ever been involved in a severely dysfunctional relationship that won't go away. Mr. Shepard creates four intricate and powerful characters sharing both realistic and ethereal existances."
2,Predictable Plot a few good laughs,"The plot is basically an excuse to chain together the not so many funny bits.Steve Coogan is a very talented comedian but in todays world he's not stretched. The competition is very poor. Twenty years ago there was a variety of talented and one-off comics in this country. Now, what was once mediocre has been elevated to the level of brilliant. Take the last line in the film. A typical brutal, sledgehammer attempt. The rule of thumb seems to be. A crude reference to body parts will always be funny. It just isn't. Its boring.In the first ten minutes most people if asked could have written a page summing up the remainder of the plot. Loopholes in the storyline were so many that suspending your disbelief to enjoy the film is more than impossible. Omar Sharif was probably in the film for less than 5 minutes but his performance steals the show.SummaryI'm told old for childlike scripts!"
1,WARNING!WARNING!,"A version of ""Eternal Flame"" is heard in this movie by Atomic Kitten, and they make it sound like a Destiny's Child song, a hip-hop song! Americans, U may not loooooooove this!"
1,FUNNY SMELL,"This product was not what I expected...It has a strong smell...not a pleasant smell!Also,I expected a little more shimmer."
1,"Headband, not mask!",Very unhappy with the fact that this is a headband rather than traditional mask as advertised. It is of decent quality but it is more masculine than feminine and looks quite devilish in person.
5,Mask,I loved the mask. It came earlier then it say it was. I use it for a masquerade party . My co - workers love the look of it
4,Splish Splash is Fun!,"The music is great and I especially like the Salmon Song. It's fun to see the kids singing and smiling and it makes me feel happy whenever I watch it.Kate, age 7"
1,mother of 7 months old baby-boy,"I have spent my valuable time looking for European toys only to find that 2 out of 5 of these ""German"" toys made in China. German culture should reflect honesty at its best, I thought... It's sold by oompa toys, which also let me know in their return form that I will have to pay shipping on the return below $65 of value... Guys, even if you are just distributors, considered recent revelations of Chinese culture, you should let people know that these toys or, at least a number of them are made in China. Got to put ""Ducky"" in the ""Boat"" and send it back to China... might be cheaper than sending them to OOmpa toys, too."
4,Another Winner,I have read all the books in the Bride Quest and this author once again has used my favourite time period and made magic with it. Her characters really come to life and she really follows her plot line well. Her books always hold me in rapt attention and I love to read them over and over again.
5,A must read for every man. A fantastic book!,"Gordon Dalbey's Fight like a Man will help every man understand why he feels the way he feels, and what can be done to overcome. Not only is it brilliantly written, the insights contained in it will uplift and comfort every reader. A must for every man who has felt different and wants victory over his perceived inadequacies. I cannot recommend this book enough."
5,awesome storage jars,"I have four of these jars in various sizes on my counters. They are great for storing odds and ends, or frequently used items. The seal is airtight, so there is no spoilage. Great for noodles, flour, sugar, spices, the possibilities are endless!"
2,Didn't fit on the spice rack,"I gave this a 2-star rating since I can still technically find use out of these jars, but Amazon inaccurately recommends these jars to go with the ""Spice Rack - Chromed Steel (4.25""hx11""wx8.75""d). The jars do not all fit and so I am left letting them sit on my counter, taking up more space. Disappointed and still on the search for a good spice/tea rack."
3,Smaller than I expected,"These are probably great jars for the kitchen, they might even hold 12.5 ounces of spices, that being said I bought these intending to use them for tobacco storage. They will hold about 2 oz. of tobacco, 3 oz. if you really pack it in. Pipe smokers be careful."
4,Made in USA? Really?,"I was using these jars today, and I noticed that there is the word ""Mexico"" embossed on the lid. I wish I knew what material the plastic ring was made of, and had some instructions about how to remove and replace it for dishwasher cleaning, as coffee grounds, sugar, etc. inevitably get trapped behind them. It also would be nice to have the seals available for separate purchase. Yes, they are thin, have a tight seal, and will probably have sharp edges and many pieces when they eventually break, but they are nice and so far so good. However, the very rounded shape is not great for space economy or stacking, so I will check out Anchor Hocking's Emma jars as well. Sadly, I have learned from this and other experiences that neither Amazon's descriptions, nor the word of the chat reps, can always be relied upon for accuracy."
4,Some good stuff,"Ghost rider is his version of Suicide's song of the same name. In many ways it is almost better than the original, simply because it is slightly more clearly produced. This gives an idea to Paul Haig's influences. Indeed before making great synth pop in the early 80's he was a member in the seminal ban Josef K. The rest is not as good and some other compilation might serve you better if you want to explore his music. Also there weere some great 12"" singles outr back then that had some great mixes that are sadly missed. Anyway this is a pioneer of electronic music that needs to be explored."
1,Excessive charge from TCP Global Corp,"Do not buy from TCP Global Corp because of excessive shipping charge. I bought two PreserveIt cans at the good price of $5.30 each but they charged $15.00 shipping making the net cost $12.80 each. Retail price in an art store is roughly $7.00.When you buy multiple products at one time, Amazon makes it difficult to identify how the shipping charges are allocated. One has to be vigilant for companies such as TCP Global Corp that advertise a low price and then tack on an outrageous shipping charge.PreserveIt is a good product for adding some degree of resistance to smudging for art work. I use it on laser printed book covers. The gloss version is a bit smoother than the matte, but I have used both types with satisfactory results. Sumdging is less of a problem but can still occur with a greasy finger and strong pressure."
4,Family Fun,"Outburst has long been a favorite of mine. So when I saw Bible Outburst I knew I had to try it. It was not a disappointment. It is a great game for the whole family.The players are divided into two teams. A card is drawn and the category is read. For example, on one of the cards the category is ""Names in the Bible beginning with 'P'"". When the timer is turned over, everyone on the team shouts out as many answers as possible before time runs out. The names may be obvious such as Peter & Paul or not so obvious such as Peninnah & Phoebe. There may be more than 10 appropriate answers for a topic. You may think of one that is not on the list. Tooooo bad. Your goal is to match the 10 target answers that are on the topic card.This is a fun-filled game; I recommend it."
5,Why Isn't This Guy a Superstar?,"I recently joined an R&B band and the keyboard player turned me on to Delbert. I was truly shocked. He is one of the greatest, most soulful voices (and arguably the least appreciated) in music. This is a 28 year old performance on Austin City Limits that showcases his talents with some fantastic material. He does three songs that my band does, Goin' Back to Louisiana, Shakey Ground and Givin' It Up for Your Love that I consider the highlights but everything on this DVD is great. I've subsequently heard him play with BB King and other soul greats and I am embarassed that I was not aware of him going back to the 60's. Anyone who loves R&B and Soul will love this DVD. Again, why isn't this guy a superstar?"
4,Good but a similar item is better.,"I ordered this because I've become very light sensitive over the years and our bedroom has several large windows in it. The mask is very comfortable to wear -- no ""eye mashing"" that most eye shades give you. It is designed to provide open air pockets around your eyes so that you could open them wide and still be in the dark.It provides very good darkness control with one exception. The tip of my nose juts out a bit and this creates separation between the mask and my face around my nostrils, letting light in. Since the windows in the bedroom are near towards the foot of the bed, light goes right up through the mask and into my eyes.I still find the mask comfortable and fairly effective (I still gave it 4 stars) but if you're expecting full blackness and you have a good sized schnoz, you may be out of luck.By the way, I ordered one of these and one ofSweet Dreams Contoured Sleep Mask with Earplugs and Travel Pouch - Black-- the latter item is better."
3,Overthought,"Sounds good, in theory, but it is too cumbersome and puffy. Which means that when I sleep with the side of my face on the pillow, the mask can buckle, letting light in.Turns out that unless you have bug-eyes, other regular eye-masks (like the Eagle Creek Eye Shades) don't touch your eye-lids or hinder REM sleep.It seems like this product is attempting to provide a solution to a problem that doesn't really exist, and as a result, becomes an inferior product.Pros: the velcro strap is convenient."
4,Blocks out most light,"This item blocks out most light. If you want 100 light blockage, you will need to buy a brand that fits a bit tighter or puts a small amount of pressure on your eyes."
1,Flat,The ball came defective. I send it to my niece in Mexico and she put some air but an hour after was flat again. I didn't bother to send it back for replacement or refund because I was going to spend more time and money than what I paid for ball.
3,not soft at all,"I played volleyball in middle school and high school. So many years passed, when I tried to get some memory of playing volleyball, I purchased this product because it's showed this one has a SOFT TOUCH.But actually it's not that SOFT, I feel so sore when I was playing.If you're strong enough, perhaps it fits."
5,Great read,"Slow to start, became interesting midway and could not put it down for the last third.Recommend for holiday reading when you can commit the time - particularly for the last part."
4,Not quite the five star,"An early Le Carre so the storyline not quite up to his later works. However the acting and production is superb; Simon Russell-Beale superlative as usual, & Geoffrey Palmer always a treat to listen to."
4,"Short, well-plotted, and a must read if you plan on reading le Carre's later work....","This is the second George Smiley book in le Carre's incomparable and timeless espionage series. In this short novel (140 pages or so) a retired Smiley does an old friend from his spy days a favor by looking into a murder in a small town that houses a prestigious and elite school for boys. Whodunit, of course, is the order of the day. It's brilliantly written and, more important, builds the character of Smiley himself for later, more famous, novels. We learn a little about Smiley's failed marriage, as well as a tad about his espionage work during World War II. It's a worthwhile read and really, in my opinion, an absolute must if you wish to continue on to read the later Smiley novels. Highly recommended!"
3,More murder mystery than spy novel,"This book follows Call for the Dead, but is more of a murder mystery than a spy novel. There are surprises as the truth is uncovered, layer by layer, but ultimately, the story is not as compelling as his other works. Very little light is shed on the Smiley character."
2,Early le carre. So-so.,"I suppose I would recommend A Murder of Quality to anyone who wants to get into John le Carre, intent on reading his bigger, better and later works. I can say this because this is the first of his books I've read, and can easily see him shaping his style and point of view. Though it is occasionally intriguing, A Murder of Quality is not a great read. Le Carre seems to be trying to figure out how to fuse a complex plot with descriptive characterizations and a larger social commentary. All are sometimes apparent, but on the whole it is a stepping stone type of experience. I do look forward to reading his more taught, deeper books."
3,"A nice overview, but lacking detail","This book offers a pretty decent overview of band theory, but it's woefully lacking in detail, especially in the later chapters, which seem to get progressively more qualitative. You shouldn't rely on this book to give a thorough knowledge of band theory, but it's worth reading. I think it would be especially useful when preparing for talks, because the explanations in the book are pretty easy to understand."
2,flawed and depressing,"This will probably be my last Perry Brass novel. Full of basic flaws such as continuos flashbacks and explanations of states of mind, it still retains a good sense of story building and telling. But what kind of story are we faced with? A very depressing one, and the only way one can bear such a thing is through an amazingly good writing, which is not the case here.Halfway between horror and sf the plot is based on two wrong assumption: such a society as it is described could not care less about the sexual orientation of its members; a society owning such refined genic techniques would certainly not need to breed human-like beings to get spare organs.I am under the impression that while writing this novel Mr Brass wanted to highlight how de-humanizing our society is becoming and is likely to become even more. Nice try, but a try nonetheless."
1,Great disappointment,"This is my first Perry Brass novel and it will be my last. The writing is mediocre and there is not a single sympathetic character in the first half of the book. I say ""the first half of the book"" because that is all the time I will give it and that time was wasted."
4,funny and exciting,This is the third book in the Mary Poppins series. It's about all the adventures that the Banks children have with their nanny. In one adventure they go to the park and see a lady selling peppermint stick horses. They buy some and ride off into the sky! You never know what type of adventure Mary Poppins has in store for the kids!
4,Truly better together,"Johnny Mathis is always good, but teamed with the truly great voices on this CD makes it a delight to listen to."
