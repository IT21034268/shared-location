3,i can't even use a rice cooker,"I don't know where to begin. i have now purchased 3 rice cookers--the last one I now have is a NSLAC05. I have followed instructions to the tee. I have cleaned my rice 3 to 5 times. i have used 1 cup rice to 2 cups water and I have used 2 cups rice to 2 cups water per the instructions. the first batch, I could make sushi with. the second batch I could make a papermache doll once I drained all the water. I put the system on white rice and left it alone except for the additional starch that showered my countertop. Someone please help because, even following instructions, how do you use a rice cooker?"
1,Updated Review,"UPDATE:Gave this thing away - too complicated, the instructions are mostly in japanese. Found that I got better results on stovetop.The operating instructions are quite vague. I am still trying to figure out how to use it. The timer is a little difficult to figure out. I'll post again once I have mastered it."
5,Fantastic,"Fantastic. Cooks rice, brown rice, mixed with Indian pulses (dals), beans etc perefectly ..very simple to use. Simplified my cooking efforts tremendously."
5,Nothing Better!!!!,There is nothing better than a Zojirushi appliance. This rice cooker and warmer also keeps water at my different tea temperatures. I use it for something every day. I even have one for work!
5,perfect,"I've been using this every day for about a month and it works perfectly with perfect rice every time. The really nice thing about it is that you can time the rice to be done at a certain time, so then you don't have to wait in order to soak the rice, you just fill up the cooker again after you finish the rice and time it to cook the next batch. It keeps the rice warm automatically, and the warming feature works really well. I've kept rice warm for a full day, and it seems to stay nice. I recommend that you get a big bag of good quality rice like tamanishiki and have at it."
5,extraordinary formal elegance and great title wow!,"This book is among the most difficult and lovely, the most austere and elegant... Sentences are spliced and skewed, language games are revolved, resolved, dissolved; or torn apart. Very pretty in its sheer wordness; very beautiful, intense, bizarre, brave. A powerful gesture. Grand, grand."
1,This book is not for digital or color photography,"This book was written in 1938. It's a piece of nostalgia, that's all. If you want to know how they did it in 1938 with Black and White film, then it's mildly interesting."
5,She won't go anywhere without him!,"My son named this guy ""Steve"" because he was a ""Steiff"", and it stuck. He picked it out and named it for his baby sister and she LOVES this bear. She won't go anywhere without Steve. We have had to work with her so she doesn't eat with him anymore because he was always tucked under her arm. Now he gets his own seat at the table and he's a cleaner, happier bear. He's been washed many times over the past year and while he shows the wear that being taken everywhere will show, he has held up very, very well for all he has been through. There are many more years of being well loved left in him."
1,Bear in the picture is different to the one received.,Bear in the picture is different to the one received. Looks and feels very cheap. Just does not meet up with what we expected to receive
2,"In a word, tedious.","I'm a big Ann Sothern fan, but she is awfully bland in ""Lady Be Good."" She's stuck with a sub-par screenplay and very little to work with. For real laughs, watch her in any of her Maisie movies (sadly not available on DVD). Why Arthur Freed produced this dreck is anybody's guess. Robert Young -- who co-starred with Sothern in ""Maisie"" -- looks uncomfortable throughout. Not all MGM musicals are classics, alas."
2,I was disappointed. This one was too raunchy for me.,"I bought this book because I enjoy seeing pretty, erotic drawings of nude women, particularly nude women together with other women. The cover of this book shows an attractive naked girl lying down in front of an older man and a dominant-looking older woman. So far, so good. But the inside of this book is overly raunchy and far less erotic. There's precious little lesbianism, and instead there's lots of XXX-rated male-to-female stuff that I found far too hard-core and generally uninteresting."
1,Bad,"Overall design does not seem durable. Broke within a month no surface damage on any of the cabling, must have a bad connection with the wires. Other power adapters work fine."
4,works just fine,"product works fine. plugging in, seems a little loose, but hasn't fallen out, so I'm not too worried at this point. Was promptly shipped. Could have been a little better packaged with a bigger envelope (was a bit tight in a smaller envelope, but was bubble-wrapped, so it was protected."
3,This one should have come with the computer,"My HP laptop came with the 65W version of this which gets very, very hot. This one does not."
2,Not really compatible for compaq,"I bought this AC adapter for my Compaq V2030 because it says it is compatbile, but the cord barely stays in the back of the computer. The slightest movement and it becomes disengaged. also the Adapter part is really really heavy and big. I wish I had just spent the money and bought the replacement from Best Buy or Compaq. Now the cord has stopped working entirely and I have no recourse. Don't by this. It's garbage that someone probably threw away and now they're selling it for way too much money. Just get the expensive cord."
1,HP AC Adapter for Compaq,I believe this particular item is defective. I will be returning it for a replacement or refund. Thanks.
1,**HOT AND SPLIT A BAD COMBINATION**,"This adapter is not like advertised, low quality material, short power cord, but the real problem: first it OVERHEATED SO MUCH I WAS AFRAID WAS GOING TO BURN. Secondly, power cord fits LOOSE into adapter, IT CAME OUT every time it moved. And to complete, the cord SPLIT, it started to tear after three months!!!"
1,piss off,"Second time buying the exact same model. Once again it broke on me. The first one lasted about 7 months and my second lasted 8 months. Annoyed by this, no longer getting this. I don't recommend. If you are wondering if I treat my charger bad, no I don't so I don't know why."
2,Poor Product,"Being that this is indeed a genuine HP AC Adapter that fit perfectly with my dv6000 and looked like a quality, sturdy product, imagine my surprise when less than a year later the product no longer works. Since I have a variety of spare parts, I know the AC Adapter is the culprit. I would have been better off buying a cheap knock off than spending money on this product. Very disappointed!"
2,"Not the worst, not the best","This power cord is just okay. It doesn't get hot like some of the cheap knock offs. However, the cord does have a hard time staying in the computer if it's not on a flat surface.This is my third replacement cord for this computer in the past 3 years. I'm still looking for a good replacement."
1,Horrible.,"This cord fits poorly into the back of the laptop, and I only get a sporadic connection. Very dissatisfied, especially considering the money I paid for this item!!"
2,Misleading book description,"This is an amusing little sports book, but the book description is misleading as Asimov had nothing to do with this book, unless he declined to get credit and it is hard to imagine the good Doctor doing that."
2,I was so bored,"I gotta tell you, I love the Blair Witch movie.SO I thought the book series would be interesting. This is the first volume I bought. And frankly, it is well written and inventive, but I found it boring. I am buying another volume in hopes of a scary read."
1,Blair Witch: The Secret Confession of Rustin Par--SUCKS,"THIS IS A PURE WASTE OF TIME. WHILE TRAPPED IN A HOTEL ROOM, DURING A SNOW STORM, I CRACKED OPEN THE PAGES OF THIS BOOK. I WISH NOW THAT I WOULD HAVE PACKED A DIFFERENT BOOK. WITH ONLY ABOUT 148 PAGES, I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN IT WOULD BE BAD. BUT I THOUGHT I WOULD GIVE IT A SHOT. THE ACTUAL CONFESSION OF RUSTIN PARR, MAYBE TAKES UP A PAGE OR A THIRD OF A PAGE. IF YOUR BORED AND THIS IS THE ONLY BOOK YOU PACKED, DONT READ IT, WATCH TV."
5,"a true rarity, a powerful creation and just some great listening!","This collection of songs is a thing of immense beauty and grace full of those wonderful melodies and stunning insights that has it stay with you long after it has played on your friendly CD player. The writing is strong, the playing great and the singing superb. I know written reviews have compared Preston Clarke to Sting amoung others because of the richness of his writing and playing. There is some of that, but really there is so much more. I have had the CD for a few weeks and still have not played it out."
5,great gift,This watch is very detailed and and well made for the price. Makes a great gift I got one for my Wife and she loved it great design for those into punk or gothic stuff.
4,"""Smoked Yankee"" Buffalo Soliders","John B. Williams wrote a geniune and explicit account of events in American history. Humor, integrity and certainty are exhibited in the characters. This book should be required reading in all schools.Toni Payne (Miami, Florida)"
3,Good headphones.,I bought the new LTB Q-Home-FX True 5.1 headphones to replace an earlier model. I was a bit disappointed that the sound wasn't as good as the previous model. The problem as it seems is caused by the headphones not being tight enough around my head. My only solution was to put a rubber band over the ear pieces to get the sound to match the quality of my older set. Otherwise everything is OK.
3,Technically helpful book mangles English,"William Buchanan's PC Interfacing, Communications and Windows Programming fills a niche in the technical world; however, I found it distracting to read because it so often mangles the English language. Subject and predicate sometimes disagree in number (""There are four areas of memory called segments, each of which are 16 bits . . .""). The author seems afraid to write a simple sentence, often choosing instead to join independent thoughts with a comma, creating run-on sentences. The book also shows signs of being spell checked by computer, in that misspellings that happen to form other words are missed (""register/memory. Specifies a memory of register operand . . ."" instead of "". . . Specifies a memory OR register operand . . . "") In short, this book suffers from the appearance of being written hurriedly, no copy editing supplied by the publisher, Addison-Wesley."
3,Interesting,"This movie was a low-budget production. However, it was interesting to watch. I know a lot of people think that it is depicting Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc. and it is. The movie shows the story of a girl who is about to go to college and pledge her mother's sorority, AAK, and her grandmother tells her the story of her mother's journey into greek life through flashbacks. Don't misunderstand me and think that just because it's a low budget production that there is no quality behind it or the story because I know AKA's who have seen the movie and started crying because it's similar to what they went through. It is a good movie for any woman who is interested in greek life."
4,Good Manual,I wish it was more specific for my model rather than several. It would be about a third of the amount of pages and I wouldn't have to look for the specific diagrams.
5,Promoting positive community involvement ...,"The concept of promoting positive community involvement is explained to children through this bilingual picture book, written by a New York City firefighter. This book highlights the fact that firefighters are important members of a community. Bold, bright illustrations complement the simple text that is well suited to emergent readers. This book is sure to appeal to children and would be a solid addition to bilingual picture book collections.Barbara A. Mascaro, District Elementary Librarian, Brentwood Public Schools, NY"
3,Entertaining,"June 26, 2005This is the story of 8 year old Tito, a boy who gets the chance to make his dream come true after he translates for a Spanish speaking elderly gentlemen. The older man arrives at the fire station to report a fire, opening the doors for Tito to ride the fire truck.Written mainly in English with key words in Spanish, ""Tito the Firefighter"" reads more or less in the stereotype ""barrio"" way of speaking. Unfortunately this cute tale is not such a good tool for teaching.However, the book does contain a vocabulary and great illustrations that will capture young readers.Reviewed by Betsie"
1,It would be simpler to develop the theorems yourself.,"This book is amazingly poor. As pointed out in another review, there are chapters in which Dubinsky doesn't even state the main theorem that he's discussing! This book jumps around every main topic in discrete mathematics, never once making any concrete statements about the properties or laws governing anything. If a book that sits around and tells you to figure it out yourself sounds appealing, pick this one up. Otherwise, grab something that might actually teach you something."
1,Terrible,"This book was a terrible source of information on discrete mathematics, and the programming language of ISETL. It contained many, many questions, and absolutely no answers. It would introduce ideas and concepts with virtually no coherent explanations and follow through with confusing examples at best. This book should not be confused with a good jumping-off point because, if one had other resources to use, they would almost certainly also contain more information. The exercises in the book are not bad, but they have relatively no basis in the book. As a work book with a REAL supporting text, this book might be of help to someone trying to learn these concepts, otherwise...forget it."
1,Sucks royally,"If you like being asked questions and never knowing if your answers are correct, this books for you. A typical question will be ""what do you think the associative property for series is?"" and it never tells you. We've gone through entire homeworks using an incorrect view of concepts, because we assumed we were right in our guess. Any book with Ed Dubinsky in the list of author should be avoided."
1,Complete Wedding Planner paperback,"It was horrid...pages bent, tea spilt all over pages, embarrassing, unable to use at all....if it didn't take so much time to return it, I would have rejected it completely, however I had already paid of course by credit card. I thought to purchase a 'used' book would be effective recycling and 'green' behavior, but after paying for the separate postage and receiving an unusable book , I was so disappointed."
2,Never received - can't rate,"Was a gift for my sister and future brother-in-law. Had it shipped to them, but it was never received. Sounds like a good book though."
1,"""A Reader"" = Author",This book is way short on substance (based on what it's supposed to help you with) and way long on anonymous hype. Don't buy it.
4,Beautiful Pictures and Tons of ideas,"Whether you are contemplating a big bash of a celebration, an intimate dinner, or an elegant afternoon party, this book has plenty of inspiration and ideas. I bought it in anticipation of a wedding potentially planned for a barn. We moved the venue, but still borrowed many ideas from the book for refreshments, flowers, lighting and other party particulars."
5,OUT DOOR WEDDING PLANNE,THIS BOOK IS VERY INFORMATIVE FOR ALL DIFFERENT KINDS OF OUTDOOR WEDDING. PLENTY OF TIPS AND INFORMATION FOR A SMALL OR LARGE AND LAVISH WEDDING.
3,Album is misrepresented,"This is a good album, but only two of the songs listed in the description are actually on the album. I have found that most of K-tel's albums of this nature have been terribly altered from their original format. I have ordered several and have been disappointed every time."
2,Sending The Wrong CD,"I ordered the Dumb Ditties CD specifically to get the song Beep Beep. When the CD arrived not only did it not have the song I wanted it was not even the right CD and it was all scrached up. I tried to e-mail the seller Sashara Mergen and never received a response. I just wanted to get the CD exchanged, I feel I was totally Ripped Off."
3,Dumb ditties (what more can you say?),I found this album to be exactly as stated. Songs were exactly as listed. Don't always believe what you read in reviews.
1,Piece of Dung,Very difficult and confusing to program and use. And it has bugs.The software seems to have been written by someone who flunked software programming.Awful. Don't buy it.
1,Amazed at the poor quality of this product.,I have 20 years experience working with computers and other digital equipment and could not get this product programed. The instructions are poorly written and the display is not in the least user friendly. Had to pay shipping when ordering and returning the product. Very disappointed!!! Would not recommend this product to anyone.
1,Sprinkler timer,"I ordered a sprinkler timer and it was to be new. The unit had been opened and used. The unit did not work; however, I did get a refund. I also had to pay return postage. I am not happy about this purchase."
5,received,"The item was received on time and the disks were of good quality, without noticeable defects. I have enjoyed the product."
5,Great!,"Both movies were in widescreen on a single double-sided DVD. Artwork and keep case new. There was no artwork insert inside the case, just the disc. Steven Seagal is a good actor in these shows. Good continuity between stories yet they were different enough in their respective story-lines to make it believable."
4,Good SG movie.,"If you like the traditional Steven Segal, then you will love this double movie set.If you do NOT like the Kung-Fu violence/action, then this is not for you.The bad guys (really bad) get wiped out, the good guys win, everyone walks away smiling..... you know, (my hero)typical action movie from back then.I enjoyed them both because I like the action and the stories..... you know, the good guy is unbeatable, unstoppable, and has all the integrity and honor in the world - all rolled up in his person. Idealism to the max. Enjoy!"
3,Where do I sign up,"Stephen at his very best, riverting to watch if you dont take it for real. switch the brain off, and enjoy some very entertaining action"
1,"SAYS WIDESCREEN ON THE BOX, BUT PLAYS FULLSCREEN ON MY DVD PLAYER...","Yes, the people at Warner Bro.'s have really dropped the ball on this one, because contrary to the assurance on both the DVD case and the info ring on the disc itself (it's a double sided disc, so there's only the info ring near the center hole on side one) this is the fullscreen versions of these films (I have a 32 inch, regular tube TV, yes I know, gasp in terror, and my DVD player is set to recognize letterbox/widescreen DVD's, so it's not due to my system being setup incorrectly) and of course you know that the only thing that Warner Bro.'s will do in the future, is to replace the DVD covers to say fullscreen versions, and not actually fix the aspect ratio problem, which sucks.Oh well, you've been warned."
1,"SAYS WIDESCREEN ON THE BOX, BUT IS IN ACTUALITY THE FULLSCREEN VERSIONS :(","Yes, the people at Warner Bro.'s have really dropped the ball on this one, because contrary to the assurance on both the DVD case and the info ring on the disc itself (it's a double sided disc, so there's only the info ring near the center hole on side one) that these 2 films are the widescreen versions, these are in fact the fullscreen versions(I have a 32 inch, regular tube TV, yes I know, gasp in terror, and my DVD player is set to recognize letterbox/widescreen DVD's, so it's not due to my system being setup incorrectly) and of course you know that the only thing that Warner Bro.'s will do in the future, is to replace the DVD covers to say fullscreen versions, and not actually fix the aspect ratio problem, which sucks.Oh well, you've been warned."
4,Great for hanging up certain things!,"So I purchased two of these hooks to hang up some old baby toys that are just too bulky to place on shelves. They worked great but they do not provide much space from the hook and the ceiling so I had to adjust for that. I think this product would get a five star if that part was adjustable. Other than that, I suggest using these to free up space in your garage!"
4,Very Motivating,"The principles in this book ""pumps you up"" to set forth change in your life. Those negative thoughts, bad habits and that ""stinking thinking,"" are about to become a thing of the past once you put these words to action in your life. As a nurse, I found the knowledge gained in this book helpful in motivating my patients to take charge of their health from the mind arena first, by association and thinking healthy. Dr Thakur lays out the framework for taking control and redirecting every adverse characteristic and habit of your daily living. He gives you the simple recipe, step by step to taking lemons and making lemonade. This book is a definite motivator."
4,Very nice tea kettle,"I've been making tea daily with this kettle for years. I have the brushed stainless one with the shiny top. I wish they were still selling these as everyone who sees and uses it wants one and I'd like to be able to purchase it for gifts.The handle can get hot WHEN it is left directly over the heating element. BUT if you place the bottom on the heat source and take care to place the handle off to the side, then it's no problem picking it up. The train sounding whistling spout cover does get hot, but I find I can pull it off quickly enough and not get burned. What I really like about the kettle is the balance. I have joint pain in my hands and this kettle is the most balanced one I have ever tried. Pouring is easy on my hands filled to the top capacity. It holds about 5-6 tea cups of water."
2,Broken right out of the box!,"This is beautiful, but arrived BROKEN! The little handle on the whistle was snapped off. If that happens during packing or transit, how will it stand up to years of use? I plan on writing for a replacement part, but what a hassle."
1,Because I Ca R bot doing it again. NOT!!!,Do not buy this product! Does not dry clear. The sealer dries with a very profound pink tint to it. Let me be clear - THIS PRODUCT DOES NOT DRY CLEAR!
3,Eh..,"If you're a super hardcore Chuck fan, go for it. Otherwise, I would stick to his novels, which are all great."
2,chuck feeling lazy,"this is by far the worst book he has written, and i'm actually glad that he apologized for its lack of creativity and thrown-togetherness in the actual book."
4,"Good reading, insightful, a little weird","There's something unsettling about Palahniuk's writing style - something that seems just not quite right - but his stories always pull me in and I have to read until the story's finished. All of the essays here had the same effect on me. Some are simply weird and appeal to the Beavis in us all (""Testy Festy""). Most are glimpses into cultural cast asides that we miss because we aren't looking. I liked the personal essays that mostly revolve around the reactions by Palahniuk and others in response to the success of the film ""Fight Club.""Good reading that makes you look a little harder at everything you take for granted."
2,Disappointed by Chuck,"This book fell far short of high-bar Chuck standards I've come to expect. Stranger than fiction is a total snooze-- rent it from the library if you're like me and must read all published Chuck, or buy the paper back. This is not a must-have-read-again-book."
4,Reality personified,"Echo else can critique creators of fiction,fact,castles,rockets,not to mention an assortment of philosophers but the man who fathered the fight club phenomenon? This collection comprised many stories I have heard before but never told with such wit and insight. I can't wait to read the next Palahniuk!"
4,Nice...,I liked to read a deviation from Chuck's normal format...and the title says it all. Sometimes life is stranger than fiction. Interesting...xoxo-Lizzie Dee
2,"No, fiction is better","I have read almost of all Palahniuk's novels and loved all of them.... this obviously was a different genre, but it just didn't work for me. I was bored with 90% of the stories with in."
5,I Loved It,"A fantastic book. A bit of a departure from ""Fight Club"" but still a great book. I have to agree it has a lot in common with ""My Fractured Life"" which is good. The strangeness in fact has wonderful pull and reward. I loved it."
1,boring,"maybe its because i am closing in on sixty,but this book was a boring letdown with little new, daring or interesting in the way of inchoate stories. read it before by better writers is my summation of the book and the waste of money buying it in hardcover is infuriating. the reviews were better than the book."
3,Sometimes His stuff is a little hard to get into,I didn't even finish the first story...maybe its my fault not his...I've listened to his stuff on audio and I enjoyed it!
3,Not Chuck's best...,"Some of these stories lived up to ""Stranger Than Fiction"", but some fell a little flat for me. I thought all stories would have me googling ""is that real??"". Not a bad book and worth a read for the half of the stories that do you have you wondering if it could even possibly be true (that first one I thought for sure was made up). Wow. Read if you are a Chuck P fan, you'll appreciate the dark humor of it."
4,Stranger than Chuck...,"Chuck Palahniuk out-does his own fiction writing, (which can be strange at times) with this collection of ""True"" stories.Any fan of Chuck will appreciate this book. It lives up to it's title, and delivers it's helping of strange and obscure topics.One of these topics is masturbation. And, he has much to say about this, including the reactions of the listeners when he read this story at bookstores around the world. And, let's not exclude the ""Testicle Festival,"" the yearly event near Massoula Montana, that includes public nakedness, sex, and debauchery of all sorts. And, of course, the consumption of fried bull testicles. (dipped in ranch dressing)So, get on...hold on tight. You may wish you hadn't, but, then again, if you are already familiar with Chuck's work, you probably would expect no less."
1,"Buy cheap, get cheap","This replacement pump hose is indeed twenty inches long, and that's its finest feature. The chuck is flimsy, with plastic internals and thumb lock that don't promise a long life. Air leaked when I got past twenty PSI. This might work for inflatable balls, but as a bicycle pump hose it's a losing proposition. Spend more for a better product."
4,air pump replacement hose,Works great. It is hard to find repair parts for almost anything today so I was glad to find it availablle on the Internet
2,Cheap fix experiment - not so good,"The chuck is cheaply made and finicky to use. If I don't position it right, it doesn't engage the schrader valve on the stem. It is also sometimes very difficult to remove off the stem. I needed to replace the chuck on my craftsman C3 air inflator and thought that this would be easily spliced on and be able to handle the light duty use of periodically topping off my car tires. I'm going to try a different setup and use another type of chuck. This one is too frustrating."
5,Great fun and Great laughs,This was a great off beat movie...a must for gay man really. I must have watched it 15 times and I will continue to do so.
1,Terrible,"This is a badly written, uninteresting, insulting movie. I cannot remember why I bought it, but I am sorry I spent my money on this."
2,Close the blinds folks...,"Awful. Funny. Awful. Shameless. But it was a like a train wreck, so I had to watch until the end."
1,9 Reasons Not To Watch,Silly. Offensive. Unfunny. Dubious. Plotless. Charm-free. Vapid. Without Redeeming Value. Stupid.I think the last one pretty much covers it all.
3,Okay.. well,"Kind of funny. Silly. Harmless. Diverting. But it could have been 9 Dead Crooks, 9 Dead Italian Guys, 9 Dead Working-Class Stiffs .. whatever. Yes, some of the humor comes from the gay factor and maybe its ultimate successs is the fact that there could be interchangable 9 Dead ___ Guys, but it still doesn't amount to too much. Silly, crass, amusing. Okay rental for a boring night."
3,"Good product but not for the Web, not yet.","If you are going to use Captivate for non-web applications, like standalone .EXE files and such, buy it. You probably won't find any better alternative on the market.But if you want to export your project to Web, you have to consider following before buy:1. Not compatible with Flash v8. You have to copy and paste some dll files, and import the captivate file into the Flash 8. Still it won't import the mouse movements. So you have to do all tween motions manually.2. Creates huge .swf files, mostly unusable for web. Example: Tried a web application demo, consists 6 steps. Captivate created 44 frames. When I import into Flash and export as swf, it turned out 4MB in size with over 8000 frames. Even if I can be able to reduce the size by half, it will still be 2MB with very low quality blurry images.I had alot better results with capturing the each screen with FireWorks, and edit them in Flash 8.Just my 2 cents."
5,Lives up to its promises!,"Software that does what it promises - every time -- all the time! Relief!Captivate makes set-up easy, puts all sorts of call-outs at your fingertips, and at least for me, does not crash. Wow!I spent a full week attempting to get Camtasia to do what it promises, but I was plagued with crashes -- and not just garden-variety crashes, but crashes that corrupted all the work I'd already done.Not the case with Captivate! I put in the images, set the call-outs, added music, and Voila![...]I'm now one happy camper. Five Stars and then some!Phyllis Staff, Ph.D.author, ""How to Find Great Senior Housing""and""128 Ways to Prevent Alzheimer's and Other Dementias"""
4,Teacher's Gift,"I'm not sure how to rate this product because it is not too exciting. It was purchased as a gift for my wife the teacher. The stickers are colorful, motivational, and completely adequate. It is exactly what was needed and expected, but I think the whole sticker thing is getting old."
3,Serves their purpose...,"I bought these stickers to use on my son's Potty Chart. All in all, I can't complain. They're cute and designed well. The only disappointment I have is that the frogs and penguins are ridiculously tiny once peeled off the sheet. It seems that most of the design is left on the sheet! Other than that, my son loves them and loves putting them on his potty chart! I will probably buy some that are bigger next time though so his little fingers have an easier time peeling them off of the sheet..."
4,Worth the money,This charger is compact so you can take anywhere. It can charge four batteries at a time (AA or AAA) and can recharge 9v batteries. As with most chargers the plug is retractable so you won't worry about it messing your clothes if you put it in your luggage.I gave it four stars though because it does not have an indicator that tells you if the batteries need charging and it will not tell you when the batteries are fully charged. This means you will have to take a note on the time you recharge your batteries in order not to fry them. Besides this point I will recommend this product. Remember this only charges rechargeable batteries. Any other battery could damage the charger.
4,One of the best,"This alarm clock illuminates when it alarms. It has a 2nd time zone and has worked well for over 4 years. Is great for travel, would but again."
3,Not a healthy choice,"Though both my dogs love Purina Beggin' Strips, I am wary about feeding them too many due to the ingredients as well as the calories. There are 30 calories in one Beggin strip. The main ingredients in Beggin Strips include ground wheat, corn gluten meal, wheat flour, ground yellow corn, sugar, glycerin, soybean meal,salt, and bacon fat preserved with carcinogenic BHA. Lots of corn meal and artificial preservatives sure isn't good nutrition for dogs and too many can lead to obesity and other health problems."
1,Read the ingredients,"I gave these to my dog without looking at the ingredients, and it was a huge mistake. The first four or five are wheat/corn/soy mixtures. My poor pup spent the next three days with awful diarrhea. Stay away!"
2,I don't know about this.,"I found a dead mouse in my bag of Purina Beggin Strips Dog Treats. It chewed its way in, presumably gorged on the contents, and died right there in the bag. I wrote to Purina and asked what could have killed it. In reply, Purina said they had no idea of what could have caused the mouse's ""demise."" If Purina Beggin Strips will kill rodents, should I feed them to my dog?"
2,Diarrhea!,"My dog loves these things. However, it took me two sleepless nights to determine these were the cause of him waking me for multiple sprints outside to do some emergency business. Perhaps one might be okay, but I gave him three broken into pieces during our walk & fetch sessions. He is 70lbs. Poor little fella!"
1,NOT SO MUCH A GREAT VALUE,Not a very good price can get 25oz at walmart for $9.98 add two gives you 50oz at $20 more beggins for your money
1,Poor quality...,"The shirt came black not blue like I was hoping it to be and as the picture shows it. Also This extra large was much more like an 2X Large. Other than trying it on once, I never did wear it. Pretty disappointing!"
4,Skyjacked,"SkyjackedI found the story a bit much, but overall enjoyed the movie It's a good one to sit and watch to get into the mood for the feature if you intend watching a few similar films."
3,"use amazon, not these people","I received my DVD fairly quick, but when I opened the box, the DVD was loose inside. The plastic round spindle that holds the DVD in place was broken. Now, the DVD won't stay in place and continues to be loose inside the box. Not happy about that at all!! I believe I will order directly from amazon instead of a second tier rate company such as this one."
3,Vastly informative but excessively emotional..,"It's clearly a VERY informative book, especially considering how little literature there is on Japanese experiments with germ warfare. It takes you from the very beginning to the very end. My complaint is that the book contains too much emotion. It goes on and on with intense personal stories of the Chinese people suffering from attacks, and incidents involving the Japanese (""Kwantung"") army's attacks on Chinese villages and towns; constantly bashing the Japanese and US governments. Emotions obviously have a way of clouding our judgement about historical events, and it is not advisable to form opinions and understanding based upon them.All things considered, I still bought a copy for my bookshelf after reading it for a school assignment for a reason. It is a VERY informative book on a subject that is a bit difficult to research due to lack of information. For this reason alone it is worth reading."
3,"A little put off by the sleep ""help...""","I am a parent who does not believe in letting a child cry it out. One problem I have with this book is that the author only includes ""helpful"" insight from moms who do practice the cry it out method. I would have liked some encouraging words and insight from moms who, like me, believe in picking up and comforting my child when she is upset.Other than that, this book is a decent resource."
1,"A so-so ""manual""","A little disappointing. I wwas hoping for somthing closer in substance to ""what to expect when you're expecting"", etc. & that kind of thing but no such luck. Oh well!"
2,"same old stuff, pretty cover","Nothing new here -- same old stuff we've tried over the years. Might make a cute shower gift or something, but kind of cliche."
2,Not that good,"This book is full of unscientifically proven advices. Some of those advices and hints must have come from long experience, but there is no clear distiction for the layman which one works and which don't. In addition to this, the language used in this book is addressing an American audience. It uses a lot of American slang that might not be familiar to non-Americans."
4,Great Book!,"This book wonderfully encompasses a vast wealth of knowledge. Archaeology, history, current events, and modern day issues are just a few things. This book is extremely well written from the introduction, to the archeological dig, to an epilogue that summarized the issues behind the dig. I found it very informative about the history of African Americans during colonial times. I also thought that it was informative on the procedures followed for archeological digs. I really got a feel for the climate, attitudes, and living of African Americans during their first years in America. I would definitely use this book in a classroom study of the early Americans. It presents an alternate view than the pioneering white male view commonly seen during these times. The many pictures are graphic, well-taken and very interesting."
5,Fabulous book! For adults as well as kids!,"Great book! Yes, archaeology in NYC! Although this book is listed as a young readers book, I found it a facinating read for adults interested in this subject area of archaeology and black history. I have never found such a great book that combines both the history of a people that few books are written on with a modern day archaeological dig.Great resource for teachers, black history month and just for those of us out there who are facinated with archaeology."
5,A great Book with simple and effective exercises.,"I've had this book for many years and find these to be among the most effective exercises of any I've tried. It's a tension-release type of system similar to forms of yoga. It's easy on the body and can be done anywhere. The prose is a little corny and out of date, and the case histories are unintentionally humorous, but the exercises get right to the point. I wrote a little reference card for the exercises to avoid digging around in the book. Also well-diagrammed. Check it out."
3,Young Keanu not in the movie much,"Where did they get the pictures for the tape box? Certainly neither lead character looked anything like that in the movie! Also the description says Keanu's character helps Olivia's character achieve success. I'd say he had little to do with it -it was all her and her friend. Nevertheless, he kills in the love scene! Overall a pretty poorly put together movie. And for a gymnast Olivia always looked kind of clunky, not graceful as you might expect. (Also my tape quality was VERY POOR.)"
4,"If you don't know where to start, start here.","If you're curious about Terje Rypdal (pronounced TARya RIBdal with the ""l"" barely sounded) and don't know were to begin, this is a good sampling of is work up to the ""Chasers"" period. It may be all you need."
5,TOEIC SUCCESS,"I've been teaching TOEIC test preparation for twenty years. Toeic Success covers all the necessary grammar, listening, and a lot of the vocabulary students need to know for the exam. The book is very well organized. This is a great book for intermediate level students!"
4,For the beginner in real estate,"I enjoyed reading the book. It's a good beginning book for someone who knows nothing about the real estate industry. It was well paced and did not ramble into other segments of real estate. It was unclear to me whether the models in the book were pricing labor AND materials, or just materials. The more help the beginner gets, the happier everyone is. Perhaps some consideration could be given to helping beginners with contractor issues? Contractors are very reliable, but so many people fail to realize the contractor may have many clients, or that contractors function best when given COMPLETE sets of wants and desires. Thanks for writing the book. It definitely addresses many issues for the uninformed."
1,Not nearly as good as his first book,"His book on flipping properties is not nearly as good as his ""The Complete Guide to Buying and Selling Apartment Buildings.""I really liked his first book, and when I saw this one on the bookshelf, I picked it up without hesitation. To my dismay, this book doesn't do its job getting a REI newbie off the starting blocks, and it definitely doesn't give any additional information to the flippers who have been in the business for a while.My advice is to skim through this one while you are at the bookstore, and then put it back on the shelf."
1,Save your money,"I back-up a previous review stating that this is far from ""A complete guide"" to flipping properties. I did a lot of research on the web prior to getting this book and found that there is a lot more valuable information out there for free than what I paid for in this book.For instance, he talks about assembling your Team. He didn't even list a CPA as a member of your Team.Waste of money in my opinion."
1,Really?,Look if you want a good book on Flipping you need to look for an Author named William Bronchick he gives you all you need to know.. This book here was a waste of time and money
1,Disapointed,I think it's too vague and incomplete for a newbie or anyone to get started after reading this book.
4,Well built small grill,"This Weber is great for people who don't have the space or budget for a larger model.It is a solid, grill, easy to use, and very few moving parts so not a lot can go wrong.The only major downside to this grill is the difficulty of loading extra coal while you are cooking. The sides of the grates on larger Webers can fold up to add more coal without having to remove the whole grate.Pair this with a charcoal chimney (it will makes lighting your coals a snap) and you will be grilling in no time."
5,Outstanding,"I always thought this was an oddball size--in between the Smokey Joe and the full-size 22 1/2 inch kettle.It's actually perfect for a small family. It has plenty of room for burgers and steaks with decent room for indirect cooking too. Wish I'd purchased this long ago--definitey not just for 1st-time buyers or inexperienced grillers, this is a for-real Weber prduct (the best name in grilling). Very nice product."
5,Classic Grill for the real flavors of summer,"Remember when your Grandfather and Father used to grill on Sunday Afternoons? Remember how delicious those burgers, steaks, and hot dogs used to taste?Remember the first time you cooked on a gas grill? How it was easier and faster - but it didnt quite taste the same as you remembered?Yeah, in the end - the old school way was /is best. A well made American grill from Weber, good quality hot coals, some applewood for good measure. The end result is a meal that will bring back all those memories and remind you what grilling is SUPPOSED to taste like.Love my Weber. Use the 18.5 when I am going to whip out a quick 4 burgers / 4 dogs / few veggies meal. When I have the family over, I bring out the 22.5. Cant go wrong with Weber. Cant go wrong with charcoal cooking. So, so much better than gas grilling."
4,Not particularly durable,"To my suprise, the legs on my grill fell off after four years. While it works great and I get great results and wouldn't go back to gas grills, just be aware that it won't last forever."
1,Warning!.. Potentially dangerous grill,"This is can be a dangerous Grill!I recently purchased a one touch 18.5 Weber ""silver"" grill to replace my old one that I used for many years. While I was very pleased with my old one, the new one is potentially dangerous because it only has ONE side handle. This is not readily apparent when you purchase this model. Note that the one touch ""gold"" grill has 2 side handles Just why they decided to put side handles on one and not the other is irresponsible. I feel it is irresponsible for Weber to sell these grills without making it clear that the silver model only has one side handle."
2,Not like my old Weber grill (smaller),"I was thinking of replacing my old grill by Weber (I own both a Smokey Joe by Weber, and also the large Weber kettle grill). I noticed on the descrip that this grill you have advertised is 4"" smaller in diameter than my old grill - so I need to keep looking for a replacement for my Weber. My old Weber and my little Smokey Joe did an excellent job for many years, and I appreciated the venting and other features that virtually let you cook however you wanted. Losing the 4"" means losing a whole chicken - I could fit 3 whole split chickens on my old grill. Maybe they still make the 22-1/2"" grill, I need to keep looking."
4,"Great grill for direct cooking, too small for indirect.","I love this grill. This is one of my four weber kettle grills I own.Assembly is a snap. The only tool you'll need is a hammer to tap the wheel lugs on. In 15 minutes you can be lighting your coal.The beauty of this grill is the kettle design which maximizes heat retention and allows the grill to act like an oven with the top on. I've cooked whole chickens, cabbage, bread, and pizza using this method. The top also has a hook on it so you can hang it from the side of the grill while you add sauce or tend to what you're cooking.My only complaint about this is its size. Its great for direct cooking steaks, chops, etc. But to do some more long term smoking of ribs, whole chickens, its a little small because the coals get too close to the sides of the food and some parts might get scorched. If you do a lot of slow, indirect cooked foods, go for the 22 1/2 inch weber kettle grill."
3,"Good, solid grill","This grill is a solid purchase for those who like to do some basic grilling. It's nothing fancy (I suggest the Weber ""Gold Line"" for more hardcore grilling enthusiasts), but gets the job done.I have only two complaints:1)The handle on the grill top gets way too hot to touch without using an oven mit. Weber should consider redesigning this aspect of the grill as a handle that stays cool to the touch would seem much more useful and logical.2)My grill arrived damaged. I did not notice the damage until I began grilling later that night. I then noticed the grill top had a small knick out of the enamel and the pulling handle had been slightly bent and clearly resoldered when examined from the inside of the lower portion of the grill. Since I had already used the grill and had discarded the box, I did not bother returning it. But I do caution others to carefully examine their grill when it arrives, INSIDE AND OUT!!!"
4,Excellent grill -- good price -- but...,"...Spend another $20 to get the 22 1/2-inch version. This grill is a notch too small for effective indirect cooking, although it works quite well to grill stuff for a family of four. For another $20, though, you get yourself a pretty darn effective charcoal grill with greater capacity as well as true offset smoker capabilities. If you're worried about wasting charcoal with the bigger grill, please note that Weber kettles are very efficient and don't use much charcoal at all!Super-easy to assemble (anybody can do it -- really) and very well-made. Ash disposal tray is clumsy -- for a chunk of additional money, you can buy a Weber with a beter system -- but it's simple enough to just put a small pot on top of the tray and dump ashes into it when it's time to clean out the kettle.This grill should last for years and fires up nice 'n' hot. Be sure to follow the directions about using the lid -- it really does help!"
5,Husband loves this grill,Grill is wonderful for a grill. Shipped quickly and the price was much lower on Amazon than in store like Target and Wal-Mart by about $20.00. Husband has been extremely happy with it as it heats quickly and is easy to clean.
3,3 out of 5 stars,A good grill but the ash tray system is mediocre. I really need a more convenient way of ridding the ash rather than removing the tray manually since it's very shallow. My balcony is large enough to grill but I don't like walking through my living room with the ash filled tray. The legs are sturdy but the support wires don't always hold well. Overall the grill is sturdy and has lasted several winters with only a cover as protection.
3,Good grill for the price,"This grill is good for the price, but I wish I had spent a little more and purchased the better one. I have the larger grill at my cabin already. The one I already have allows you to lower and raise the charcoal which is a very nice feature. I figured that all of the Weber grills had that feature, but this one does not. It also seems like the charcoal burns out much quicker with this one. The food turns out great. It just is not what I was expecting. I should have read the description better."
1,Bent Leg,I received this product with a bent leg. As luck would have it I was able to bend it back enough to use it. I think Weber makes a good grill. But I wouldn't risk getting a bent leg so don't get this grill.
1,"Weber 18.5"" grill",I had gotten one of these years ago and so decided to buy one for a friend recently. What a mistake that turned out to be. This product is no more the product it used to be. The legs that they use are made out of pot metal and are not sufficient to hold the kettle part. They started spreading and because it is so flimsy that it now sits at an angle.I would not recommend this item to anyone wanting something of value.
3,Manual de gramatica with Atajo CD-ROM,"The book was in good shape, but I thought it would have the CD-ROM."
3,Basic information on the Belle Epoque & prevailing mindsets,"A book of dissertations by a number of Italian scholars, La Belle Epoque should be read once one has gotten a good feel of the period from another book like ""Paris in the Nineties"" by Rudolph or ""Edwardian England"" by Pearson or one else might find themselves confused after finishing the first two chapters due to the remainder of the book focusing on the psychological aspects and arts of the period.The upside of this book is that while it focuses mainly on France, and then Edwardian England, it includes tidbits on fin de siecle Austria, Germany, Italy and even Romania, as well as a calendar of newsworthy events from the years 1900-1914 culled from newspapers of the era. While this book is apprx the size of a coffee table book, don't be fooled. But if one happens to stumble upon this gem, be sure to pick it uo, if solely for the vastly entertaining calendar at the end of the book."
1,Not a true replacement,"Mislaid my original grate. This replacement slips below the lip bringing it closer to the coals and more difficult to seat evenly. Bars at handle don't cross grate completely allowing food to fall into flame if grill is crowded.When I located my original, the REPLACEMENT IS 1/2"" SMALLER IN DIAMETER!!!! VERY DISAPPOINTING"
5,Deep in the Heart of Tex-Mex food,"Do not use this book if you are looking for nuevo Tex Mex or heart healthy, dietetic fare. I've been using this cook book for over 10 years as my basic, definitive reference for classic recipies. While it is the best book that I have ever seen for its shear number of award wining chili recipies, it is also excellent for salsas, barbeque (dry rubs and sauces), beans (Red Caldwell's Beans-R-Best) and chicken fried steak. Believe everything they say about technique and difficulty of making good Texas barbeque. I have just about worn out my second copy and will soon start looking for my third."
4,A show case for the wide variety of Texas cooking styles,"Wonderful recipes, hilarious comments and anecdotes, nice background information and photos organized by style of cooking: Tex-Mex, chili,barbeque, etc."
5,Texas on the Halfshell,Most if not all recipes my wife uses has come from this book. She says it's the best book recipes she has ever come across.
2,A little disappointed,"First of all this isn't really a ""cookbook"" per se, rather it is a collection of reader-submitted recipes. I'm sure there are some really spectacular family recipes in this book. But do I need forty-eight chili recipes that are all quite similar? Some of the recipes call for ingredients such as ""1.5# beef lard"", ""2 cups Oleo"", and other ingredients that either aren't common or don't even exist anymore. Some recipes do not list quantities, just ingredients. And some are so simple that I don't know why they are in this book (i.e. Chili con queso: 1 can chili and 1/2 lb. cheese). I only paid $4 for a used copy, but I'd rather have my $4 back."
3,resistance chair,"It's good and the exercises will work....however, the bands are not sufficiently strong for someone in their early 60's, but suitable for someone in their late 70's. I would need more ""resistance"". Though available, they must be purchased."
1,Broke third time it was used,"We purchased this chair on the recommendation of a physical therapist for post surgical exercise for a 195 lb person. The chair is lightweight and the metal parts are very sturdy. The plastic chair seat is not. It broke in six places on the third use, pinching and cutting her in the process. She would have probably had to have stitches if we hadn't also got the optional chair pad.Our relative's surgery was delayed and the chair sat in the box for a long time before she used it. Amazon won't replace the defective seat (we didn't expect Amazon to) and neither will the manufacturer. We are horribly disappointed that VQ Action Care does not stand behind their product or care that it caused an injury. Their response was to sell me a replacement seat for $40. I bought it because the chair to too expensive to just throw away but now my relative is afraid to use it.Defective product."
5,Great exercise system,"I love this resistance chair! As someone who is just beginning to exercise again after a long time of being a slug, this system is great! The DVD workout helps to build confidence and to make you feel positive about your abilities. My knees are shot, and being able to sit while working out is just what I need. I can modify the step exercises to build strength while avoiding addtional stress on my joints. I highly recommend this VQ ActionCare Resistance Chair Exercise System."
1,resistance chair has no resistance,I bought this chair for my mother and it is lame. I tried to return it but the restock charges were 40% of original cost plus the company will then charge you the shipping......try another kind of exercise equipment and save yourself the trouble.
1,crappy,totally crappy and I now let my dog sit in it. its looks cool for that only. do not purchase this if you do shame on you
5,Resistance Chair,"My dad just recently had a stroke. He has very little room for big exercise equipment. This chair is perfect for his needs-it folds up so it takes up very little room. The resistance bands attached to the chair give him a good workout. Overall, I am very pleased with this item."
3,a stretch for conseverative Christians,"For a conservative Christian it is difficult to press through to the end of this book, but I am glad I did. I was able to gain insight into thinking that I had priviously either ignored or rejected. I thoroughly enjoyed the archetypes pictured by Arnold."
2,Not My Thing,"Psychobabble, categorizing like crazy. Excessive worry over control and logic (If you do a,b, and c then d happens but you need to do a,b, and j if you want k to happen). For the record, I believe women to be the logical ones not men. I consider men to be the dreamers, the intuitive ones. I couldn't finish it.I believe that males ""are"" therefore they are. They don't have to prove anything to exist anymore than women have to prove anything to exist.The author (with respect to the deceased) sounds like either a feminized man or a man pushing feminine memes. More ""original sin"" for being born a male."
1,not good,"If you are trying to decide whether you want to have children and would like to read about other women's experiences, this is NOT the book to read. The writing is not very good and the author does not go in depth with each woman she interviews. I found this book boring, and more for those women who insist every woman should experience the joy of motherhood, not those of us who are questioning whether we want children.In my opinion this book is better: ""Maybe Baby: 28 Writers Tell the Truth About Skepticism, Infertility, Baby Lust, Childlessness, Ambivalence, and How They Made the Biggest Decision of Their Lives"" by Lori Leibovich. Or even ""Baby Not on Board: A Celebration of Life without Kids"" by Jennifer L. Shawne (for a lighter read)."
5,in praise of childfree women,"I would like to give full praise to this book. I was beginning to think there were too many women who thought children were an entitlement and a commodity whereby they could earn more subsidies from the government for having kids (like welfare.) I am happy to see that there are some women that take the optional role of parenting seriously (to be, or not to be.) I would like to see another book like this written from a male perspective. Just as there are women that want to be childfree, there are a lot of men that also resonate with this choice."
4,some are better than others,"Overall these stories were great. The ones that really stuck to route 66 were the best. A couple just mentioned the road. I doubt these short stories gave justice to some of the authors. J.A. Jance is a much better writer than this book shows. Most of the stories have twists at the end. It was fun to guess the ending, but I was wrong about 1/2 the time."
4,A good fun read and great projects,"A great reference for those who like to tinker with the hardware side of retro games. I found this book to be a very good reference, well thought out and very applicable to the hobby of retro gaming and will appeal to the enthusiast at all levels."
4,English Orientated,"This book is good but it has two flaws. One the vocabulary is extremely English orientated. Basically they took a English vocabulary book and wrote 'near' Japanese equivalents for the words. For nouns this leaves out a ton of important Japan only cultural words. For adjectives and phrases there are forced translations like 'Thank goodness! - Arigatai.'As mentioned before, there is no kanji except for in the index. Why this book was orientated towards travelers and why travelers might need to use words like ""nuclear proliferation,"" and ""unemployment compensation,"" is beyond me however.There is another book called Japanese Vocabulary for Speakers & Readers ISBN 4-590-00706-1, I don't think it is printed in the US. In terms of volume, it is inferior to this title, but it is very Japan orientated and contains the actual kanji for each entry."
1,Unreadable on the Kindle,"Despite its usefulness or not, on the Kindle, most of the text is in the form of images which do not zoom and are too small or faint to read. Completely unusable. Do not buy this!"
5,Can't beat it for the price,"This book is superb. It has vocabulary for various diverse categories(e.g. ""Animals"", ""Characteristics and social traits"", ""The hotel room"", ""Hardware"", ""The changing world"", ""Computers"", and dozens and dozens more) and a brief but very useful English-Japanese dictionary at the end. Most importantly for a beginner like me, the pronunciation of every Japanese word in the book is given and the dictionary presents the Japanese translation of English in romanized letters and Japanese characters. Therefore, if you're going for the gold like me and trying to learn the spoken and written word, you have an excellent ... book to start with. It will take you awfully far for just a few bucks. *****Highly recommended."
4,Kids Learning Japanese,"We are a military family stationed in Japan. Our children, aged 13, 12, and 9, have opted to attend Japanese public school. This book is helping them to recognized vocabulary related to school subjects, especially math and science. Reading words, then hearing them in context is a valuable learning tool, and this book is divided effectivley for that purpose. I have ordered two extra ones, on for their Japanese tutor, and one for me! I recommend this book for anyone studying Japanese."
2,Just another Dictionary,"This book is a dictionary that is catoragized in subjects not alphabeticly. There is no kana or kanji in here, instead there is some rediculous pronunceation. I have been living in japan for 6 months and bought this book to help me BUILD my vocabulry. Unfortantly it doesnt help you learn anything. I recomend this book for travelers not for anyone actuly learning japanese."
4,sweet merciful crap!,"Spastic and up-tempo musical intention have not felt this good since Discordance Axis. They hang in rhythym, while intentionally playing off-rhythym. The guitarists are incredibly talented, chromatic derivation spewed about like theres nothing to lose. Definately not their most focused, but a good release nonetheless."
1,RIPOFF!!!,"Only ""Mr. Bass Man"" by Johnny Cymbal and ""Sweet Pea"" by Tommy Roe are the original recordings. Everything else is a new re-recording. Unless you like a lot of covers, don't bother. It would be nice if somewhere on the Amazon.com site this info would be available. I swear, it's like a crap-shoot when buying these oldies compilations."
5,Extremely fast upload speed,This product met all my expectations and more. The fireware reader is necessary though. The reader increases read speed by at least 5 times. Amazing speed with this card.
4,too fast for love,"the extreme IV on a d300 with the battery grip is perhaps too fast of a combination. it makes the camera spit out captures like a cobra. if you don't need this level of performance, have a camera with a lower frame rate and a smaller buffer, an extreme IV is overkill. other than that it's a great card, very reliable so far. 4 stars since it's still a bit pricey. no real difference between this and lexar's UDMA 300x, so get whichever one's cheaper."
2,Card worked great for about 4 months,"After 4 months I got ""Err 2"" on my Rebel XT. I was able to get the pictures off the card, but now neither my PC or camera even recognizes that there is a card loaded. I'm going to try to work with San Disk to replace it. Wish me luck."
5,Superfast,With the SanDisk reader this card is super fast. Worth paying extra for vs. no-name CF cards.
1,Slow stuff.,"I hated this card. I usually use a SanDisk 2 GB Extreme II CompactFlash Card and I made the mistake of assuming (yes, big mistake) of thinking that the new series 4 would be faster than the series 2 that I was used to. It was sooo much slower. It ruined my shoot. I ended up tossing it aside and puling out the old stuff. I returned it and am now waiting for my refund. We'll see how that goes."
5,Superfast,It's a superfast experience making it possible to store up to 800 photos in high quality. I'm using it on a Canon EOS 5D camera and it increases the shooting capacity on a single battery .
5,Great storage card for my D200,"I previously used the Ultra II card, and this one tops it in all ways. I can take way more photos in one go than before, which is especially useful for wildlife photography, sports and the like. Like a previous reviewer, I also get a higher number of shots with this card on my D200 than with the previous, faster write speed means the cpu uses slightly less power on each shot. Fast read speed, so copying my full sized high res images to the comp isn't nearly as tedious as with my previous card. I wouldn't recommend testing it out, but mine has also shown to be very durable, through drops, spills and other various accidents."
3,Not Sure Why!,"I am not sure what is the reason for the slowdown but when I shoot continuesly at high speed. Using my Nikon D300 and Vertical grip on I can get up to 8FPS however, after a few rapid successive shots......it slows down signifying some bottleneck somewhere. I look at my pictures and it seems like the file size is only about 6-8MB so I can't understand why is my shoot slowing down when extreme IV is supposed to go at 40MB/sec speed......I am a bit disappointed because of this!"
1,"'Data Error"" is somethign which do nto like to see","""Data Error"" on my DSLR is not something which I like to see when I take photos. I bought the 4GB card almost 6 months back and might have taken 1000 or more pics. I get this error now and the acrd is not accessible.I am learning my lesson now. Do not buy cheap cards if you are a serious user."
5,Best album of 2005,"Plain and simple...this album rocks! Best Moistboyz album yet. Never heard of Moistboyz...buy this album, you'll be amazed. Moistboyz fan...then you MUST have this album. Picks up right where III left off.I haven't stoped listening to this album since I got it in October. Few CDs stay in my player this long, but I've yet to tire of this awesome rock fest. It's too bad these guys don't get noticed more, because they deserve it!!!"
4,kept the water from freezing,"Worked as promised! While my normal dog bowl of water froze, this stayed liquid when surrounded by snow! My dog seems to prefer NOT to drink from here though. He will drink from here, but only after trying his other drinking options. So I don't know if the plastic somehow makes the water taste weird or something. I guess it would be nice in stainless steel, but overall, I'm quite satisfied with the operation of this product."
5,Winter lifesaver!,"Very good product. The cord is bite resistant and my dogs have not even tried to bite it or the bowl. It looks great, is sturdy, and does not get knocked over. I would buy again in a heartbeat. Plus it does as advertised and keeps the water warm and unfrozen."
4,Keeps water from freezing,"Keeps water from freezing, works fine. The power cord is covered with spiral metal (sort of like a stretched-out slinky) to keep dogs from chewing on the cord and getting electrocuted. The spiral metal is not very thick or strong, however, so if your dog is an aggressive chewer, it may get through the covering. If your dog doesn't chew or gives up easily, no problem."
4,so far so good,"Decided to spring for this model since the other brand's heater dies after a couple of years (my own experience). Hopefully this one will last longer. A couple months in MN winter, so far so good."
1,Freezes!,"This product just doesn't work. The first one we bought froze when the temperature went down to 0 degrees Fahrenheit. It didn't freeze completely. There was ice above the surface of the open water and a small hole 2-in across that increasingly grew smaller as the thermometer dipped. So we returned it as we live in Winnipeg, a place where winter temps get down to -40 deg Fahrenheit and this bowl was meant for the use of feral cats we're feeding. We bought another one, thinking that the first one was maybe just defective. Same thing happened with the second one so we returned it!"
5,heated dog bowl,Love the bowl. Don't have to worry about the dogs not having water to drink because the bowl keeps it from freezing.
5,For the Chickens,"This bowl is much larger than the 1.5 gallon heated bowl I bought at the farm store. Our chickens will drink from the bowl but are more reluctant to do so, preferring their chicken water fount. Although our chickens have defrosted water available in their coop, they rarely go in to drink once they get out for the day.I was able to put a gallon sized, plastic water fount inside this new bowl. The water fount sits just at the rim of the bowl. Other reviewers had stated this was enough to keep the water fount defrosted. This simplifies chicken keeping in the winter! I won't have to run hot kettle water over their founts to keep them happy!"
5,great product,This works great no matter how cold the weather has been the water has not frozen since we started using this bowl. very happy
4,Great thermal bowl!,My dog loves to live outside and this does a great job of keeping his water dish filled with water not ice!
4,Great Product,"This is one of those simple, but effective products. It does exactly what you want it to do - keep the dog (cat, or whatever) water from freezing, not require a lot of maintenance to use, and not cost a fortune. This hits a homerun in all three categories. I accidently clicked the ""quantity"" box when ordering this, and ended up with two instead of one dish. So one got re-purposed to be a water warmer for my chickens. The one i *intentionally* ordered keeps water drinkable for an outdoor cat. Both have been perfectly effective down to -4 degrees the last couple of nights. And as far as I can tell so far, the dial on our electric meter is not spinning out of control, so though the electicity to run these is not free, it looks like they are reasonably effecient."
2,Didn't hold up one winter,"Came quickly & worked well for about 2 months, then died. Maybe if you live in a climate that doesn't get too cold it will work better. Definitely not made for real winter weather"
2,Alright I guess,"Got this hooked up a couple of days ago. I had the receiver and the camera side by side and was getting all kinds of static noise and a jumpy picture. Might be because I have 2 other wireless routers in the house also. Haven't tried another channel, will do that soon. The low light feature really doesn't do much, I can't see 5 feet in front of the camera, even with my porch light on at night. Picture is good during the day. As long as you turn the sound off and don't mind a little bit of a jumpy picture, it's not bad for a wireless outdoor camera."
2,TOO ORIGINAL,Ive never given a cd this low but i went to buy this and was exited.Then i got home listend to Downfall.Then i listented to the rest of the cd and i swear its all the same.Now im not cutting them down but they need better lyrics... the cd is boring not bad.Just if you like songs that are just the same as linkin park songs or other rock bands just someone that kinda sounds like linkin park you might like this.BUT IF YOU DONT DO NOT GO AND BUY THIS...!!!
2,I'll be generous,"This album gets two stars for the one good song, ""Downfall,"" and even that's me being pretty kind. On a good album the single should be one of the weaker songs (see either System of a Down album), but here it's just the opposite. Most of TRUSTcompany's songs are WAAAAAAAAAAAY too slow. Now I'm not a person that hates slow music in general, but if something's going to be slow it should at least be heavy, or have a strong melody, or an interesting structure, or high-level musicianship, or SOMETHING. The slow songs on this album are just uninteresting to the point of nearly being sleep-inducing. I heard this album at my friends' party, and even after a bunch of beers it didn't even make good background noise."
2,*YAWN*,"I bought this CD because I kind of liked the song on the radio, and it had been a while since any new music made me want to buy a CD. This CD was just plain boring. Nothing stood out. Nothing perked my interest. I will not buy another CD from this band."
1,Absolutely Terrable,"Well, I bought this CD because I really liked their single ""Downfall"" but... it turns out that is the only good song on this album. All the other songs are slow and boring, save your money and don't get this CD. Truly, a one hit wonder..."
5,Outstanding!!!,"Trust Company, a band I never even heard of a couple of weeks ago, now I can't stop talking about them! This album was beyond perfection, from the first song to the last song, it was like an action movie - nonstop thrills! I first heard 'Downfall' on a local rock station, and I checked out the sample songs on this site, and they were all good, so by the end of the day I had bought their album! My money was definitely well spent on this! So, for the people out there, two words......BUY THIS!!!"
5,These guys ROCK!!!!!!!,"This is the best cd that I have bought in a long time!!!!! It has some of the best hooks that I have ever heard. Also Don does a great job in the production....right down to the driving drums and the lowend bass to the melodies on the guitar to the very passionet yet subtly painfull vocal trip that this guy takes you on.. You can tell that something bad has happend to him and the words are real, not some [junk] made up to be cool or sell cds..I would like to meet the woman who screwed him over to make this cd.. Anyone who pick this cd up will be very impressed!!! I am looking for the second on the horizon!!!!! Catch their live show too!!! It's as diverse and pack with energy as the cd!!! Coming to a town near you!!!!!"
3,"cheesy, but enticing","i would have to guess that these guys listened to a lot of pantera and than went seriously soft. these songs are all bubblegum. they play the music distorted while they hit those sweet notes. they are not overly talented either, especially where guitar is concerned, although the drums are alright. personally i think this music would only appeal to 11 year olds who like hearing loud music. but then again the album is actually something that is great to get you in the mood and you don't feel like listening to very quiet music. emotionally it grasps you. i think that everybody who is feeling down should buy. it really liftens your spirits. it sounds cheesy but it really grasps your attention. they remind me of linkin park a little bit too. overall i think that everybody should buy it but it shouldn't be their number one priority."
5,My All time favorite album. Hands Down.,"This album has been something special for me, for the past decade it has never been more than a cd player away. I remember picking this album up shortly after Sept. 11th, I was in my early twenties and the pain and anger i felt were mirrored in a few of the songs. almost ever song follows a mind stimulating formula, come in and hit hard, then get a little melodic then hit hard again!!! I genuinely love this album. Ive had the pleasure of meeting and hanging out with the band, and you wont meet a more down to earth group. theyre not millionaires, just guys who make the music that they want. This album will continue to be my go to. Thank you Trust Co for making something so damn awesome!"
1,:(,"i was really excited the day the trust company cd came out cause downfall is an awesome song. unfortunately it's the only good song on the cd. they really do sound like a very toned down version of linkin park, as much as i hate to repeat that. as a matter of fact they sound like stabbing westward meets linkin park, and then together they meet n'sync. they sound like a boy band trying to play rock. i was totally disappointed."
5,My Favorite CD,"This is my favorite band, and favorite cd. This is not Beatrice Eley this is her nephew Blaine Eichner. Don't think your taking advice from an old lady. If you like rock or punk-rock I think you should buy it. Actually you better buy it or I'll hurt you...... for real......."
5,TrustCompany has this years best CD!!,"Lets get started by saying if you Like Hardcore Lyrics and the best mindblowing beats you have to get this years best Alternative Cd. The Crazy thing is that this band comes with a different flavor that alot of bands out there are lacking and that is More Rock and Less Hop! Put this Cd in your Car and Relax let it played it will take you throughout different emotions! The Cd's First Single Downfall has the Energy to make you get up and mob yo head. I Recommend Running From me, and Finally this songs rock but again those are my favorite why wait for radio station to pick up the songs Get them now and be the first to experiensed the new sounds of TrustCompany, Listen with an open Mind. One Last Thing If You Liked Linkin Park,PapA Roach Or Even Korn you will Love TrustCompany. I seen em Live and when ever they come to your town check them Out.-sanjokidd"
5,Trust Co. Debut Album,"I gave this cd the whole 5 stars because i believe that this is a great CD. I wrote this review to give praise to Trust Company and its debut album. I'm not goin to try and describe how the guitar riffs are great or other such special-musical aspects. I'll just leave that to the expert rock-music reviewers. Just want to give credit where it's due, and it's due to Trust Co. all the way! They have really got what it takes to be great!! So just a small piece of advice-buy the cd and see for yourself why so many already consider this 5-star music. That's all..."
4,Grandson's Wish,Got this and another one for my grandson who will be 13 within the week. He loves it and knows all the songs and words.
5,Thank You Brittany,"My girlfriend recommended ""Downfall"" to me, and I never expected them to be as good. So I got the cd, and it's awesome. From start to finish, they are the best. I can't wait for their second album to come forth.I can not name a favourite song, as they are all amazing, it's been a long time sonce I had trouble choosing a favourite track But if I had to choose from the 11, I'd have to say ""Running From Me"" & ""Deeper Into You"".Thank you Brittany, I Love You."
2,Trust Company,"The Album Is Not All What You Expect After Hearing The Song ""Downfall"". That Being The Only Heavy Song On The Album. These Guys Have No GUTS! The Singer Practically Whispers In All The Songs. They have TalentThers No Doubt But They Need Some Real Guts."
1,Don't buy this,"Don't buy this ... All the songs on the album... besides Downfall and Running From Me, both of which you all have heard. You're not neccessarily going to like Trust Co. because you like Linkin Park and I know because I'm an LP fan. Go buy something that's worth your money like Chevelle and Breaking Benjamin."
1,"Don't Trust This ""Company""","When I first heard ""Downfall"" on the radio, I honestly thought it was Linkin Park. Then I found out that it was Trust Company. Good thing there's only 11 tracks on here. I mean, the only halfway decent track on this album is ""Downfall"" and it's already sounding kind of old. The tracks following ""Downfall"" all sound very much like it, with the exception of the musical introductions to each song. The introduction of #8 (""Deeper Into You"") sounds frighteningly like Unwritten Law's ""Seein' Red."" Don't buy this CD unless you want to waste some money."
1,don't Trust this Company,"There are 2 things wrong with this album:1. The lyrics are trite and at sometimes, make no understandable point. They remind me of something from a depressed 6th grader's poetry book(and the kid can't write). ""Downfall"", one of their more popular songs, is a prime example of pointless lyrics.""Can I break away?push me away, make me fall,just to see another side of me,push me away, you can see,what I see, the other side of me""And what exactly is the other side of you? Maybe that other side could write some smart songs for a change.2. Songs sound the same. Guitar and drumming is basic, high school band quality. This wasn't as bothersome as the lyrics, but it's not enough to save the band.I will give credit to the singer, he can sing fairly well.This just sounds like everything else on MTV that people call rock, I'm sure some skateboarder, GC fan will fall in love with TC."
1,Been done before. a lot.,"My god. This guy can't sing. What makes him think he can front a band? He's whispering. That's not innovative and unique. That's just talentless. I would much rather hear someone belt out a song about ""frustration and anger"" instead of whisper it.Talentless.Wow, they can play power chords.What idiots signed them, anyway? Because it seems that somebody wants to eat up a LOT of consumer money by advertising this as something special to listen to.Linkin Park is better than this, at least Linkin Park has two vocalists doing completely different things."
1,Krap,This album is awful every song sounds exacltly the same. I think i even fell asleep listening to it. I loved the first single but after i bought the album it ruined it for me. Don't waste your money on this Linkin Park rip off. I tried to take it to fye to exchange it for a new cd but guess what? they wouldn't take it beacuse they already had too many copies. Hmmm.... Would you like fries with that?
3,very emo,"this album is hella emo! no offense or anything. but seriously. they need to get something more to write about. some songs are good. i like downfall and hover alot for some reason. there are great riffs and good drum beats. the bass lines are okay.... but other than that the lyrics just tear apart this album. The sound of new metal. not that bad for a debut. get some iron maiden, judas priest, metallica (early days), MEgadeth, Anthrax, Queen, and maybe motorhead. cuz they rule."
1,Another terrible band....,"All of their songs sound the same, no guitar solos, just some wimp crying about how lonely he is so he can make money. I was stupid enough to buy this album a few years ago and fortunately, I have gotten rid of it. People need to stop relying on TV to get music and start going to music stores or going on the internet to look for good music. Linkin Park sucks too, by the way. There, I said it."
3,Trust Company!,"Well,.....I was a little disappointed in this album! I was expecting a little more from them. At times the lead singer can sound a little girly! Its decent though! If you are looking for something new you might like this,.....worth giving a shot!"
2,"Been there, done that, ahh.. too bad.","I bought this CD when it came out and was utterly disappointed. Every song sounded like every other song. There were no good hard rock screams. It was all just bland music and cheesy lyrics. The guitars were too happy, and played the same three chords all the time. Don't waste your money. Save it for a good band like System of a Down."
4,"TRUST ME, IT SOUNDS LIKE LINKIN PARK!!","I would say that this record sounds like it could be the follow-up to Linkin Park's Hybrid Theory! Trust co. sounds so similar. I would have to say that it is good though! ""Downfall"" opens the record, and it just flows through with good straight forward modern rock music, the whole time sounding like Linkin Park. Other good tracks include, ""Running from me"", And ""Slipping away"". So if your a big fan of Linkin Park, which alot of people are, including me, you will really enjoy this record. Oh by the way I do like this record, and recomend it, however it loses a star for originality."
2,"Not Groundbreaking, but Good","This band is pretty good, but it's a little too radio friendly, and a little too similar to Linkin Park. The guitar parts are great, really crunchy and energetic. The drums and bass are great. The only problem lies in the singing and songwriting abilities. This mans voice is okay, but it's be better for pop music. It just doesn't fit in with the hard rock music in the background. His voice is very light and soft, and his screaming is weak. It almost sounds like he's trying to whisper. Also, while I know that all songs dont have to rhyme, these songs dont even come close.I would recommend listening to Linkin Park instead of or in addition to this. LinkinPark's guitar parts are not as crunchy, but the singing, rapping ... and DJ skills more than make up for it."
1,Garbage,"This toy lasted 2 days in my house. The weight on the bottom is created by you filling it up with water. With normal wear and tear, the seal between the water bottom and the air top broke. Can't get the water out , so now it is just garbage. Very dissappointing."
3,"Decent DVD player, but spend a little extra and get better ones.","I got it for my 18 mon old, to use on a long plane journey to India, along with an extra battery. The player looks nice, isn't too bulky, and reasonably sturdy. However, it is slow (press next chapter for a DVD, and it takes considerably longer than a regular DVD player). Battery life is enough for one movie. It doesn't have dual headphone jacks, nor does it have FF/REW/SUBTITLE buttons on the unit itself, need to use remote for that. Swivel feature is cool. Doesn't come with a decent bag. The remote doesn't have volume control (no big deal though). I also had it freeze the picture (audio kept playing) on multiple occasions mid-movie, and had to do a little rewind/fast forward (whose buttons aren't on the unit) to get it moving again.All in all, a decent inexpensive portable DVD player."
4,Not bad,"When i first received this player, after the first 3 weeks the screen just went blank but Amazon was great and sent me another one right away. this new one ive had for 3 weeks and hasnt gone bad yet. i like that everything is included (remote, headphones, and a little case). i recommend this dvd player for anyone that has an overnight job like me."
2,"After 2 of These DVD Players Die, We Give Up!!","I was very excited to get this DVD player for my wife. She used her old one all the time and this seemed to have comparable features and a good price tag. Unfortunately, sometimes you get what you pay for. The first unit I purchased broke after 3 months of use. It would not recognize discs anymore. I got a replacement and now 3 months later the brand new unit (not refurbished) is doing the same thing! Coby will take it back for limited warranty service (even though I am 3 days outside the 90 day window), but they are making me pay for shipping to them and then I have to enclose an $18 money order for return shipping. But what are they going to do, send me a 3rd unit that will break? I am very upset about this and want to warn you that if you plan on using this on any sort of regular basis, beware: it will die. So long, Coby!(I would change my stars to 1 if it would let me!!)"
3,Good but .......,"It's a good product at the first time, but the short Battery life is a big problem to a product portable because you lost all mobility to use the device wherever you want do it, this should be ones of the principal benefits itens of the product. So I recommend the product if you don't worried to use it always conected"
4,portable dvd player,So far so good. We are enjoying our Coby dvd player. The swivel screen is cool. I've had absolutely no problems with it!
2,"Okay, but decided to return for something better","This machine was okay, but I thought I could do better for my money. The noise of the disk running was so loud when it was sitting on my lap, that I had to turn the headphones all the way up. That did not seem like a good, long-term solution. Also, the swivel and the case were very cheap plastic. It felt like it would not last long. In the end I returned it and bought a more expensive, but hopefully longer lasting Sony swivel screen. So far it is heads above the Coby."
5,wonderful - wonderful,Alexander Ptushko is known for his fantasies but this simple romance is his best. It is wonderful and warm and a romance to be treasured. And it is not overproduced. In this cynical age you can do much worse than this outstanding film.
5,Lasts Forever!,"The grid for my smokey Joe has withstood the test of time, many summers in the humid south, and even occasional abuse from my four children who've gotten it out and used it to play ""jail"" and other weird kid games. It has not bent, rusted or corroded, and will probably outlast me! I've had cheap grills in the past with substandard workmanship, and they are now at the dump. My Weber grill and all its well made components is the only grill I think I'll ever need."
3,Keep reading this book,"This is a credible and fascinating glimpse into a world that probably no longer exists. The innocence of the '50s juxtaposed with the ""sophisticated"" main character is compelling. I found her mother to be equally interesting in her love/hate relationship with her daughter. Intelligence was evidently not a desirable attribute in a southern girl at that time and Gloria's struggles with that make this an absorbing read. As an English major, I loved the references to what she had read and was reading. Gloria's conflicts with her inner and outer self and the ""secret watcher"" are worth a few second thoughts. I liked this book and I was disappointed when it ended. I will see what else Keith Maillard has to offer."
5,Glorious!,"A glorious romp! It's hard to believe a man wrote this detailed exploration of the 50's and 60's; not only the meticulous detail to clothes--including undergarments--but to the entire social milieu, particularly the accepted attitudes towards women. As a contemporary of the fictional Gloria, I found it especially evocative. Great summer book."
5,One of the best books that I have ever read,"This wonderful novel engulfs you. You feel that oppressive southern summer humidity, taste the bubbles of champagne, smell the crisp Aututmn leaves outside of Gloria's sorority house. To read Gloria is to experience her world, her era, and her own quest for self. For a lengthy novel, I flew through this one. I loved the narrative descriptions of her pledge experience, her lack of post graduate direction. It is surprisinlgy easy to relate to the cashmere enrobed heroine. I could not put it down nor could I have been more sorry to reach the conclusion of this sparkling novel!"
5,Great for the winter or the beach,"Two weekends ago, my mother and went on a sking trip. I hate to ski. Instead of moping around the hotel alone I read Gloria and finished it in 2 days. This novel is extrememly intresting and a ""page-turner."" The vast amounts of detail, although meticulous at points, helped form a picture of Gloria and her life in my mind. As many of the other readers, i too was shocked upon the relization that the author of this novel is a man. Gloria was certinaly worth my time."
1,Couldn't use it!,"The designof this knife leaves much to be desired. I could not get the safety latch to operate properly, so I called Black and Decker Customer Service, hoping to get some help. However, the representataive told me that the design had been changed, which made operating it difficult, but there was nothing to be done to help. She seemed familiar with the issue so I assume I was not the first one to call for assistance. At this price, I don't want to go to the expense or trouble of returning it, but I certainly would not recommend it to anyone."
4,Handy Knife,Bought for daughter as gift especially for slicing biscotti. She likes it but it would be better if it came in a case.
1,Don't like it,"This knife does not work well for me. I can't seem to get the blades in right, and they don't move back and forth well, so therefore does not cut my bread good. I'm not sending it back because it is too much trouble, so I will give it to my sister and see if she has any better luck with it."
2,A solid loser.,"The safety guard part of the on-off switch seems to be defective since unless you put a ""death-grip"" on the on-off switch, it stops during each slice. I have used Black & Decker tools for years and never had a minutes problem with any of them but this knife is a loser and I would never recommend it to anyone."
3,On a par with most,I have had many electric knives and this one is on a par with most of them. Absolutely great for slicing bread loaves.
1,Zero Stars,I purchased this knife in May of 2010. It is now BROKEN. I originally had a GE electric knife for over 25 years. When it broke I purchased this one even though the reviews were mostly terrible. Black & Decker took over the small kitchen appliances from GE years ago and have not made any good improvements to the knife. Like many people said the knife shreds meat. If they had such a good product why did they change it into a piece of garbage. From now on I will never buy any Black & Decker product. Do not buy this product or you will be sorry because you will be throwing your money away.
1,Don't Waste Your Money DANGEROUS,Blade insertion force is very high. Blade guard is very small. My dexterity is excellent however the combination does not work and I received a severe cut trying to push the blades in far enough for them to lock. A similar issue exists for blade removal. I can easily overlook an accident caused by a fault of mine however this is a design issue. In addition the performance of the knife is extremely poor. Didn't make clean cuts on turkey and had trouble cutting bread. Extremely poor design. Don't buy it.
1,loser,"This item is a total loser- buy something, anything else but don't waste your money on this. Will not run while depressing the safety while while holding the unit horizontally, but it works gooe if you hold it vertically. Nonsense. I would've try to send it back uf that wasn't ;too much of hassle."
3,Just Ok..,This knife shows wear and when slicing a strong smell of burned plastic is present.But for this price if stops working for any reasons you don't loose lots of money.Overall just ok knife!
4,Cutting heaven,"The only problem I have with this is the locking mechanism. Having bad hands, it's sometimes tricky to activate the knife."
1,taking a gamble,"Family needed a good electric knife to replace my brother's old one (40 years old). I read hundreds of reviews regarding every electric knife I could find. I was surprised the Black and Decker I bought was the same model as our ""old reliable."" It claimed to be able to cut all meats, cheeses crusty breads, roasts. Took out a beef roast from the fridge. My brother tried to make slices five times, it would cut a quarter-inch then blades would stop, but motor kept going and handle would get hot. IN UNDER A MINUTE the knife blades would not cut air. Did much research. problem is mixing plastic in motor with steel to save a few cents. All electric knives are foreign made by people on slave wages. I would pay up to $75 for a good electric steel knife Made but a factory in U.S.A. presently one is given a chance, a gamble on will it work or not. Most don't last 6 months with weekly use."
1,GARBAGE,"this is garbage. I made 3 slices of our holiday turkey, and the blade fell out. why? because the little pin on one of the blades that holds it in, broke off, and fell INTO the knife. So, now it's GARBAGE. can't get the piece out, and even if I could, I can't sodder it back on.i would give it NO stars if i could"
2,Disappointed,"I would have to have three hands to use this knife... can't keep the ""safety"" button pressed and pull the trigger with one hand so it was not possible to also hold the fork in the turkey. Very awkward for me to use."
4,Good knife,This is a good knife for everyday use. It slices bread and meats thin and evenly. The only complaints I have are that the safety switch is awkward to use and it's a bit noisy. But overall I'm happy with the product and would recommend it - plus the price is hard to beat.
3,"110 V ONLY, single speed",Its high time such products follow international voltage standards. flimsy blade. watchout you get a gap between the blades.
5,"Great for carving foam, too!","I bought this knife because I am a crafter, and I needed an electric knife to cut some foam rubber for a window seat pad. It cut through the foam rubber ""like butter."" But then Thanksgiving came, and my father wanted to try it on the turkey. Perfect! Now my father owns one, too!"
1,Christmas is cancelled.,"I didn't make it through the turkey breast before the blades stopped syncing and it wouldn't even cut through the meat. When you pay $8 for an electric knife, I guess you should expect a sub-par product. Plus the safety button was intensely inconvenient. It essentially made it impossible to cut unless you held onto the device with both hands, making it much more difficult to use. Not to mention it whirs with the intensity of an industrial blender! It's so loud, you would swear I was making daquiris with this thing!But this is only my review of the product that I used for less than 60 seconds, because it stopped working after that. Will I waste my time getting my money back? Nope. It will just sit in my junk drawer with my broken Black & Decker power screwdriver and power drill.Notice a theme there?"
1,Disappointed,"Heavy, need to keep your finger on the trigger at all times, blades are hard to insert and remove. Would not recommend this electric knive to anyone.Disappointed"
1,Dangerous and worthless piece of junk!,"I just bought the B&D EK700 electric knife. I opened the box, read the manual and prepared to use my very first electric knife. It sucks to be me, because I just spent $20 on a knife that doesn't work! I can feel the motor moving, a few seconds later the handle is getting really hot, I can smell something burning inside of the knife and on the second attempt, IT STARTED SMOKING! The blades never moved. This knife is more than just a piece of garbage, it's a burn hazard! Now, I have to take this piece of crap back to Walmart. I'm getting a refund. This is the only electric knife they sell and I'm not risking bringing another of these into my home. B&D should stick to make vacuums, that's the only thing they do right. Unless you like the process of returning faulty items to the store, I suggest that you stay far away from Black & Decker products. This knife is a safety hazard and a major FAIL!"
1,Black & Decker Electric Knife EK700,"The knife arrived in good shape as promised so put it away for later use. First and only trial was on a fresh loaf of wheat artisan bread ... hard crusted. After 6 slices the knife's gears gave up! Luckily, discovered the problem within the 30 day return period and Amazon made my return painless ... so will try maybe another brand.My previous electric knife was an older Procter-Silex that lasted 6 or 7 years. Maybe they just made them tougher back then. Stay tuned!"
1,Bad Design,"Tried the Black and Decker Home Slice Right Electric Knife EK700 at Easter .What a disaster !!! Pulling the trigger-it did not want to stay on .While carving,the ham would get between the blades thus slowing it up& giving me a horrible cut . I was carving a Kunzler ham,no fat-no bone .My previous Black& Decker knife worked great for 9 years,but it is nowdiscontinued !!!! Will try another electric knife but not this one!!!"
1,Didn't last,This knife worked exacltly twice! It worked for two Thanksgiving turkeys and that was it! I tried to use it for a Christmas turkey and all it did was whirrr. The blades wouldn't move so I would have to assume that there is a gear (probably plastic) on the inside that is shot! Would not recommend this product!
1,Don't bother.,This knife is poorly made. It quit during the first attempt at cutting a roast.Buy yourself a good conventional slicing knife and forget electric knives. B.C.
1,Blades are horrible,The blades continue to separate and fall off. Very very disappointed.As soon as the blades come in contact with whatever should be cutthe blades come apart.
1,Broke with first use.,This knife had mostly good reviews so I purchased it to use to carve our Thanksgiving turkey. It broke with the first use.
4,Worked great for us!,"This knife worked great for us, sliced through the Thanksgiving turkey like butter. My dad, who has carved over 30 Thanksgiving dinners, said he actually liked it better than the GE electric knife he's used all those past years (it died last year). Looking forward to using it many more times!"
1,Disappointing selection,"This is my first receipt of a request for a review of a purchase. Unfortunately, you happen to choose a response to the ONLY purchase I have made through Amazon that I was not entirely satisfied with. All previous purchases have been thoroughy satisfactory in all respects! I had purchased this product as a product with a very similar model number was highly rated by Consumer Reports. Upon receipt of the product, it was obvious it was not the one rated so highly. The knife is absolutely terrible! It cuts very poorly and I will make another purchase in the near future. Unfortunately, I disposed of the Hamilton Beach electric knife it replaced before using it....my error!!!!!!!!! Again, all my previous purchases through Amazon have been PERFECT!!!!"
4,Good Knife,"Had this knife for a few months. Great little knife, the only thing i'd change about it is the blade holder for when you're putting it away. its just a little plastic piece that was lost with in 2 uses :)"
2,"Cuts , but clogs","The knife works well when completely clean, but as you go along it gathers meat between the blades. This requires stopping cleaning the blades. This was only a 12lb turkey and it took 4 cleanings. My old GE lasted 12 years and never had a problem."
1,trout guide,"The blades gum up with meat from filet while filleting fish. I filet a lot of fish, do not recommend this knife to fishermen. I have the same brand knife I have been using for years and it works fine. Wanted to have an additional one on hand for when the other gives out."
1,Broke,"Well, if it would have continued to work after the first few seconds, it might be nice! So I can not suggest for anyone to purchase this product."
1,"Piece of crap,,,,","Did not last through one tri-tip before breaking down. Not worth the trouble to return it because it was not priced high. However, I expected much more from a company like Black and Decker."
1,ek700 Black and Decker electric knife,"I ordered an EK700 9"" knife and it didn't work. I sent it back and wanted a replacement. When thre replacement arrived it didn't work either. I cancelled my order."
1,"OMG, what a piece of garbage!","The blades will not lock in place correctly, so they pop out when trying to slice bread. Meat would be impossible with this thing. Spend an extra few bucks on a better knife. I wish I had."
1,Black & Decker EK700 electric knife,"Wife used this electric knife to remove corn from the cob to blanch and freeze, made it thru 8 cobs before no cutting action. Unit runs but no movement of blades. This Black & Decker works about as well as the B & D coffee pot works, we're done buying their junk."
2,Blade won't cut.,"For many years I used a Black and Decker electric knife. Finally the motor conked out. Aha! I found a new one! But the problem is that the knife will not cut. I use it for homemade bread, and it takes a long time to cut a slice and then only if I bear down on it.To use it for carving is a real challenge.I will look to see what other knives are available."
1,Difficult & Awkward,"Inexpensive, but disappointing unit. Blades difficult to insert, unlock safety button on trigger re-engages constantly during use. Frustrating. Sorry i purchased."
5,Great Little Knife,"I bought this knife to slice my homemade bread and it works just as I intended it to. I must admit the first time I used it I got bread between the two blades but it was MY error. You have to be careful to insert the blades correctly and make sure the tab on the one blade is securelyin the slot on the other blade. Once I figured this out there was no problem. I have also used the knife to carvemy roasts, ham and cut sandwiches. Great size, it fits myhand just fine and I had no problem with the locking feature either. Just take another second and make sure thelock is off."
5,GREAT KNIFE,I OWN A RESTAURANT AND GO THRU A LOT OF THESE. THEY WORK GREAT! VERY GOOD PERFORMANCE - WOULD RECOMMEND
1,No good at all,"We have an older model of this knife which served us well for many years. We probably use it a dozen times a year, therefore I ordered the cheap one and it is so cheap.The blades do not hold together so from the first time we used it it was terrible. This one will go to the landfill and I will spend the money for a better product."
1,Really bad design,"This knife has a really bad safety design. It's just a little plastic dowel that blocks the switch. You have to reach under the knife and push it in and pull the trigger at the same time to allow the knife to operate. As soon as you slightly release the trigger the safety jumps back to block the trigger again. So now start over again. Very Bad.I have an older B&D; knife that just has a trigger ""cover"" and it works perfect! Really poor Chinese engineering."
3,Not easy to use.,"Hard to assemble and difficult to release the blades when done. Does an ok job cutting, but not thrilled with it."
1,Bad knife,"You get what you pay for . . . This knife is of so poor quality that is surprising it has the Black & Decker brand name. The device has a ""safety"" button that is difficult to hold while pressing the on switch. Consequently, the knife can easily slip from the hand and could cause an accident. I'm sending it back."
4,B&D Electric Carving Knife,"Works fine, with a reliable, powerful motor. Makes a little more noise than some others I've used.Sometimes it's difficult to insert and remove the blades - a very tight-fit."
1,AVOID THIS KNIFE FROM B&D,"Black and Decker has always had great products. This electric knife WAS one of their great products. I ordered a new electric knife to replace the old B&D; I had. This knife is BAD - it been reconfigured so you can't release the safety lock, then pull the trigger to cut. You have to hold the safety lock at the same time you pull the trigger to activate the knife to cut. I'm left handed, and you just can't do it. It takes 2 hands. Impossible. WHAT A PIECE OF CRAP! AVOID!The old reviews from years ago say it was a great knife, and it was. Read the latest reviews after they made changes to the knife. You'll see how bad it is."
5,Have used it for over 2 years on bread - no problems so far,"I've been going through my previous orders and adding reviews of them and found this one from Aug 2010. I've had this knife for over 2 years and it's still going strong. I don't use it every day - sometimes a few of times a week, sometimes not at all for 2 weeks so maybe 1-2 times a week on average and almost always used for cutting homemade bread. Even after dropping off of the fridge a few times (where we keep it to ensure it's out of reach of 'young hands') it's still worked with no issues."
1,"NOT A 9"" BLADE -- TOTAL SCAM","I bought this product specifically because I had a knife with an 8"" blade, and wanted one which was longer. Imagine my surprise to discover when this knife arrived that its blade was an inch shorter than my old knife!! The cutting surface of this knife measures no more than 7"". I don't know how they got 9"" -- maybe they were measuring the part that extends into the body of the handle? Regardless, there is nowhere near 9"" of usable blade on this knife.I can't otherwise rate it, as I packed it immediately back up for return."
1,black and decker electric knife,"This knife is not any good. You cannot use it to slice meat.The meat gets stuck between the blades. It was cheap, butnow we have to go buy one that works."
1,I wish I'd known before I bought it !!!!,"My husband always wanted an electric knife so I purchased him one for this Xmas. He un-wrapped it Xmas morning and was really chuffed with his present and was excited to use it on the turkey that day. When he opened the box I saw the happiness he had, just drain from his face.The knife had a 2 prong plug on it - I feel that such a significant point like this should be stated in the items description as standard - not having a 2way adapter he could not use it. I am hoping that when I buy an adapter tomorrow he will be able to use it. It states I need a polarized plug I really hope this is not another obstacle I am going to encounter.I purchased this item purely on the positive reviews made and I really wish this point had been raised as I definitely would not have purchased it."
2,bad knife,the knife doesn't cut well.it is hard to turn on with the button on the side andthe trigger below. it is hard to keep it running.
5,Great Pick,This is an excellent knife. Was a little concerned when I placed the order but I'm very happy with it.
1,RE: Difficult to use,Thia knife is so hard to use because of the safety switch that I would recommend that you DO NOT purchase it.
1,Item Defective or Product Is Inferior,"Thanksgiving Day was the first opportunity I had to try this product and thankfully I saved my old one, as this one will be thrown away. It seems the blades are built too far apart from each other, and when slicing, the meat clogs up in the space between and tears the pieces off the meat rather than slicing them off. I was ending up with a plate full of hunks and shreds of turkey instead of nice slices. This knife is a worthless joke so don't waste your money!"
5,A necessity for all carnivores who cannot carve a beast!,"I've been using this for over two years now. It still carves like it did on day one! It has the coveted job of carving every roast that comes into the house. It's over and done in the Shakespearean ""one fell swoop""--meat, sinews, joints and all!A bargain for what it does! Easy cleanup accompanies it!"
1,Worthless. Broke after 30 seconds. Cheap plastic internal parts.,"Purchased this knife feeling good about its review history. Opened the package, everything seemed pretty solid. Used the knife for about 30 seconds, and I noticed it wasn't cutting very well. Opened up the handle to find very cheaply made polyethlyene plastic drive wheel had broken. What a horrible waste of my time and money. BUYER BEWARE."
1,Won't filet fish,"I purchased 2 of these knives, B&D EK700, 9 inch, for the explicit purpose of fileting panfish, e.g. crappie, small bass, small catfish. When I used them for the first time (20Aug) it was obvious that they were intended for bread, tomatoes, and nothing more. The reciprocating blades separated and raw flesh moved between them as they sliced. This caused them to move away from the intended cut line. I would recommend that all potential buyers for this purpose look elsewhere."
2,B&D Electric Knife,The safty lock out is a pain to use and gets in the way of operation of the blade. The 9 inch blade is too short when carving a larger turkey or roast. A 12 inch blade would have been better.
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"Don't waste your money. I gave this knife one star because I had to give it something to write the review.... it deserves 0 stars. I brought the knife home and I tried to slice roast beef for a sandwich. The blades barely made it through the roast beef, shredding the meat as it went along. The meat shreds also found their way in between the blades, making a mess of everything. The blades are too thin and very flexible.Black and Decker Home Slice Right Electric Knife EK700I put the knife back in the box, returned it and bought a Hamilton Beach."
2,Gap between blades,"I have had several electric knives over the years but this is the worst. It has a small gap between the blades and this allows the meat that you are cutting get between the blades rendering it useless. I have only used it on roast chicken/turkey so I cannot comment on how it is with bread. Others seem to have no problem cutting bread. But if you want to use it on poultry, buy something else."
1,Not worth even the low price of $20.00,"I purchased this knife earlier this year to replace a different brand I had for many years, but is no longer available. I chose this knife primarily based upon the reviews I read. It is not worth the hassle of returning it, but it is nearly useless. The blades are set too far apart, and they tend to shred the meat instead of slicing it. And, it is virtually impossible to slice meat thinly. You need to apply a lot of downward pressure to even get through the meat, which really fatigues the hand. If anyone knows of a good quality electric knife, I would love to know about it. They seem to be hard to find. Don't waste your money on this one. Mine will likely end up in the trash."
3,decent knife for a good price,"haven't had any problems cutting through the usual --- roasted meats, cakes, etc. overall a decent electric knife."
1,almost ruind my thanksgiving,"Have used electric carving knives for the past 40 yrs.Never had a problem carving thanksgiving turkey.(I am a surgeon, and take pride in ability to do a great job)This knife SUCKS!!!!! (I know ""a poor workman blames his tools"")but this knife is cumbersome, heavy, and the ""lock"" mechanism is non existent.DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ITEM"
1,Find a Better Knife,"The Black & Decker EK700 Electric Knife is supposed to cut without any problems, well I've had my fill with this device.I had to return 2 of these knives due to poor construction quality. The first knife would not let me insert the blades into the knife itself due to some obstruction. The second knife would not lock the ""run"" lever so I could not use the knife unless I had 3 hands. The blades would consistently fall out of their ""locked"" position.I owned one of these knives for about 2 years and never had a problem. Now the knife's bearings are loose and it's not worth repairing. The old knife had no problem locking the ""run"" lever.I can only guess that Black & Decker is using cheap parts to build this device. If you want a quality knife--look elsewhere!"
2,Disappointed B&D Electric Knife(s)-,"Both the insertion of the knife blades into the B&D electic knife and using the on switch on the electric knife is not easy requring some dexterity. I understand the need for the safety device for the on switch when operating but this could have been designed better. The item was reordered thinking it was a flaw with the blades and the ""on switch"" and still waiting today (12/25/2012) for UPS to pick up return item (first electric knife) back to Amazon. Interesting enough, we reordered and received the 2nd ordered knife very timely and despite closely following instructions, the blade knife comes out slowly from its ""clicked on"" position after about fifteen seconds. We will be returning the 2nd knife once UPS picks up the first electric knife. Surprised that this being a B&D product that it does not work well compared to other electric knives I've used."
2,safety to silliness and agg1rivation.,The knife might work but the safety prevents getting the job done. With concentration you can get the motor to run once and the safety feature takes over and kills the job. I intend to find some way to jury rig this thing that has been improved to total uselessness.
2,"Meat lodges in gap between the two opposing blades, which drastically limits smooth cutting and cutting ability.","Used electric knife to slice turkey Thanksgiving Day. Meat lodges in gap between the two blades, which prohibits clean cuts. Have to stop often to remove the meat that gets wedged/lodged between the two blades."
2,Keep looking for a better model.,I found it hard to use. There's a tiny button that has to be pushed in at the same time you push the larger button that controls the blades. You need both hands to operate this knife.
5,An excellent carver!,This knife is only used on special occasions and has always done the job extremely well. It cuts very well and the best part - cleanup is so easy. I highly recommend this knife.
1,Junk,"This is the worst electric knife I ever had. It is very hard to attach the blades, the switch is too difficult to use and the handle slips out of my hand. I can't believe that any one of the 4 & 5 stars reviews are honest. I ALSO HAD TO GIVE IT A 1 STAR TO GET TO WRITE THIS REVIEW, IT IS A MINUS 5 STAR. DONT BUY THIS KNIFE AT ANY PRICE. I did not use it for several months and lost the carton so I did not bother to send it back to Amazon. I wish the manufacturer would read this and apologize for this terrible design knife."
3,electric knife,"Knife is a bit weak on a pineapple...but otherwise, O.K. I find the blade insertion to be difficult...not as smooth as others I have had."
1,Horrible Product,I have owned numerous electric knives over the years. I thought a Black and Decker product would be a good bet. This knife is a joke. Tried to carve a turkey and after a few cuts put it down and used my regular knife. It couldn't even cut through the white meat of the breast. Same out come trying to slice up bbq chicken breasts. Don't know how such a poor product could even get to the market. Deserves 0 stars if I could do it. Just threw the the mentioned product in the trash to save drawer space.
4,For the price can't beat it!!!,For the price of this product you can't beat it. It def does the job! I wish it was a little sharper but again for the price can't be to picky.
2,OK for me but....,"I bought this electric knife to cut foam rubber and it worked for me as it was cheap and cut the foam well enough. I would not recommend for use as a kitchen tool. It is very difficult to trun on and the on position does not lock although there is a ""lock"" button. You have to hold the tiny button in the whole time it is in use. The cord is very short so I had to use an extension. The knife is very flimsy. This is a good craft tool for my occasional foam rubber cutting but I would no count on it to carve meat."
3,Flimsy,"It does the job, but the blade is rather flimsy. Very thin metal. Also it is very poorly balanced. It is very heavy on the rear end which makes it tiring to hold very long. I would recommend spending a little more to get a better product. I am just going to use it to trim stalks from elephant ear bulbs."
4,a good electric knife for the money,"I am basically happy with this product, the only caveat being that it is fairly difficult to disconnect the blades. They built it with safety in mind and it took a while for us to get the hang of getting the blades out to wash after use. Other than that, it is a great product."
4,Get's the job done!,"I have used the knife three times so far and am pleased with it's performance. My old knife which I had for 20 years was built better than this one so it probably won't last any where as long. And my old electric knife came with two blades, a short and long one. I was disappointed to see only one blade with this knife and that is why I only gave it 4 stars."
1,Broke during first use,"This knife stopped cutting while using it for the first time, worked fine for less than 5 minutes.. Disappointed of course and returned."
2,"works, kinda","the knife works but clogged up way to easy and stopped working for me, not sure what I am going to do with it now"
3,Knife works...but is cumbersome to use due to safety feature,"Knife has a spring safety that locks the knife in the OFF position 100 times or more as I carved the 20 pound turkey for dinner. This feature WILL BE disabled or removed before I use it again....suggest you get another design rather than go through the aggravation of using this one that has to be re-started using both hands each time you rotate the knife to accommodate the cut you need to make. The safety is much like the one used on charcoal/candle lighters....only located on the bottom of the knife and much more difficult to use. May be desirable if used around children, but this would be a stupid as the design."
1,Not worth the money; buy a good (expensive) one,"Unfortunately I sometimes have a tendency to be cheap, and then I end up a product like this. Pulled into it by my trust of the brand......I bake my own bread, and the first time I used this knife, something broke on the inside, causing the knifes not to move any more, at all. I haven't opened it up yet, but seeing how cheaply it's made, I have a feeling it is not a coincidence. Definitely not worth buying...."
2,Not such a good find,I bought it so I own it but I don't use it! The blades don't stay together as they are suppose to and it was not my best buy here on Amazon.
4,Pretty good product......,"Simple to use, easy to clean and works pretty good for the money. I will put it to the real test on the holidays, but so far it works great!"
1,Poor quality.,I purchased 2 of these knives and gave one as a gift. I found out later that the gift quit during the first week. When I used the one I kept for myself I found that the meat I was slicing came up between the blades and did a very poor job of slicing.
3,Works Well,"This electric knife works really well. Unfortunately, it has a safety button on the trigger that must be pushed while starting the knife. I find this very awkward and difficult, so I tend to just keep the knife running once I finally get it going. It's workable. I'm trying to find some way to disable this annoyance."
2,Love it/hate it!,"Like all Black and Decker products, this one is sturdy and a great buy for the price. However,the safety lock on this model is almost a design defect. It's very difficult to hold the lock down while operating the knife, causing constant stops. I got the knife for my mother, who has arthritis in her hands. She couldn't use it with the safety lock, so I cut it off. Yes, I know, doing that voids all warranties. However, it was useless as it was. I couldn't recommend this model to anyone. Our last Black and Decker knife lasted for some 20 years, and was very easy to use."
1,piece of garbage,Terrible piece of garbage. The handle required you to keep a button pushed in while using leading to an awkward and dangerous way of holding the appliance. I brought it back to the store as I have done with many Black and Decker things. When will i ever learn that B&D do not make things well.
1,Waste of time and money,Found the easiest way to get the blades IN was to push both eject wings and push down. However the combo of badly placed safety switch and trigger is actually dangerous. Only one blade moves; still allows you to cut; but not like it's supposed to. Black & Decker should stick to electric drills and stay out of the kitchen.
1,Had the same failure as some other reviewers,"Unfortunately the knife only made it through 1.5 turkey's. It performed well carving the Thanksgiving turkey then midway through the Christmas turkey the blades suddenly stopped moving but the motor kept running. I did not bother to disassemble it but I suspect the same issue that another reviewer had where a plastic gear was stripped or broken and the motor could no longer move the blades.I did not feel I was putting excessive strain on it, it actually did a good job when it worked. Fortunately the return window from Amazon was still good and I was able to return it with minimal effort. Five stars for Amazon's customer service as always."
1,Disappointed,"I bought this for $10 at Walmart and it worked great for a while. It cut fine and made slicing bread and other bakery items very easy. Two months later the blades stop moving any time I try to slice something that is remotely solid. I've used it to cut rice krispy treats many times over those months and suddenly it can't handle it. When holding the knife on it's own the blades move, it's just when I try to cut something that they stop...weak."
2,"Black & Decker EK700 9-Inch Electric Carving Knife, White",Product was received on time. The ability for the knife to cut through the chicken bone is unsatisfactory. I had to provide extra physical strenght to make it work. I had an electric knife earlier an it was a very good knife. It cuts the meat/chicken with little effort on my part.
2,Needs tight grip,"I have used the knife on both meat and bread and found it to work very well. My complaint is with the lock and trigger. The lock which is a matter of pushing a pin to one side of the trigger is annoying, but doable. The trigger, however, requires a tight squeeze to stay activated. Keeping the trigger from 'locking' again isn't the issue for me, and holding the trigger in the down position isn't enough, you have to squeeze hard to keep the knife going. We're talking 15 seconds before my hand is cramping and and if I re-grip to alleviation the cramp in my hand, that stupid trigger lock pops out. Having to hold it in the awkward position required to keep that trigger squeezed tight enough compromises the control of the knife blade. I like performance of the knife blades, but can't recommend it for anyone without a super-strong grip or a lot of patience."
5,Great Show,"Xmen Evolution I think is better then the '90's cartoon. I think its more upbeat and updated with more characters and a better storyline, I totally recommend it"
3,Less Than Objective,"The author wants the book to be a memorial to all Jews that died on Latvian soil. In the ""Preface to the English Edition,"" the author claims that Latvians, on the whole, are totally anti-Semitic. However, the origins of such beliefs cannot be determined. The author believes this to be true of the Latvians, during pre-WWII Latvia and the new Latvia of the 1990's. I wonder if things are so black and white.This book is a combination of history and a memoir. There are footnotes and a bibliography. However, if a reader is looking for an objective, historical view of this topic, it is not found here. The author recounts his personal experiences during WWII. It is remarkable how he and other Jews survived.The author does point out that after WWII, some people who were in a Nazi concentration camps found themselves in Soviet concentration camps."
2,Philosophy and cooking don't mix here,The concept of this book intrigued me but the reality was disappointing. The stories in front of the recipes were not that interesting and the recipes were mostly more work-intensive w/o tasty results.
3,"Nice story, beautiful scenes, fairly factual","I like the way they present the story of ""Silent Night"" but this version was created prior to historians finding new information regarding the composing of the carol. If they would update the narration to reflect the fact that the words for ""Stille Nacht"" were written in 1816 and the music added in 1818, it would take away the fairytale aspect of the story. The segment called ""Silent Night, World War II, 1944"" is very well done - good story and very good actors. You may need some hankies before you get to the end of the story. ""Holiday Fest in Austria"" is a nice extra feature."
2,Not enjoyable.,"I purchased this DVD without being aware that it was a documentary more than a movie. We did enjoy hearing the Vienna Boys Choir sing ""Silent Night""."
3,rating of the stars,"Well, I really felt sorry for the little boy named Billy, the boy was confused, so I thought, but his parents were careless, and didn't want to listen to him, or get a chance to understand him fully, talking to the shrink and all, he could've had a nervous breakdown."
2,Not the same Greg Long,"This is not the same Greg Long of ""Jesus Saves"" , at least I don't think it is. The Greg Long that I'm familar with sings. This is an instrumental recording with modern style music. I was expecting Greg Long singing contemporary songs with a Christian message. The music is not bad but not really my taste."
1,Warmed over motivation,"I guess the author has some minor good points, but not many. Skim through and put it in the back of your bookshelf."
2,Mixed Feelings,"I suspect that this is one of those books that some readers will absolutely love, while others will be left disappointed. The book is FULL of illustrations; references to movie clips abound. Church growth ""success"" stories are frequently described. If you are the type that likes to sprinkle your sermon with statistics (especially with stats that illustrate how we are failing as a church to impact our society), then, this is the book for you! Regretfully, though, I found this book to be lacking in the area of solid content. Upon reading: ""Lost in America,"" there was nothing that I read that I had not read before."
5,Your answer to big circles,"I am not a big fan of plastic parts on a compass. But this is just used on ocassion when I need to draw a large diameter circle. And I can use it in my Stadtler body if I need to. But the one thing I do like is the ""press to sweep"" button that allows you to press it and pull the arms out. Release the button and it locks in position. It overcomes the time it takes spinning the screw to got out to large diameters."
5,It will fit an ultra fine sharpy pen!,"I bought this on the hope that it would hold an ultra fine sharpy pen, and it dose. This was a must for my AMT A&P sheet metal repair class. When laying out patches for aircraft a good marker is the only way to go and if you don't have to carry a set of circle patterns you win. With the pencil lead arm you are able to design on paper as well as lay out on metal as well.."
2,"Overpriced for the knock-off quality, but better than nothing","This item says it is made in Germany, but the metal finish is horrible and uneven, and the plastic pieces are not cut flush. The engineering and manufacturing is horrible, and it is not as sturdy as any of the older Staedtler compasses I used in the past. I don't know what kind of compasses other reviewers have been using (I'm not being flippant) but if this is the quality you get from a German compass sold for 24 dollars, then maybe it's time to just switch to Chinese product :("
2,ECM'S LAST CHANCE,"Admittedly ECM's first Pat Metheny Works album could have been added to, but most of this is poor choice. The CD came out after Pat's move to Geffen Records and appears to be ECM's final attempt to glean some money from the brilliant artist that they once had."
2,Confusing,"The book has a very good introduction to statistical methods. The chapter on pre-analysis data screening leaves much to be desired. The authors leave out important information necessary to run the tests. Our teacher had to keep giving handouts because the narrative of the text was confusing, misleading, and incomplete. Save yourself some grief and buy another book."
3,Easy Reading,"A typical ""romance novel"" , some interesting/exciting moments.Easy reading for a change of pace."
3,she is so annoying!,"I'd like to start by saying that I thought this was a good workout. I am still in the beginning stages of getting back in shape, and even after following this video for 5 consecutive days, I am still huffing and puffing my way through the workout. That being said, I don't think I will do this workout again, because the host bugs me. She made too many errors during the workout: missing the beat, losing count, forgetting what the next move will be, etc. A couple of times she forgets the transition, and it just looks sloppy. It's like they did not rehearse this before shooting. Oh, and one other thing. The host feels the need to chitchat through the whole thing. I so often wished I could mute the tv so I wouldn't have to hear her, but I needed to hear what move was coming next. All this may not bother some people, but after 5 consecutive days, I don't think I'll ever play this DVD again."
2,Wasn't very impressed,It's very hard for me to write this review because I am a huge Leslie Sansone fan. This workout has too much going on! The transitions from walking to running to lunges was too much for me & I consider myself a person with pretty good coordination. I will just stick with Walk & Kick which I enjoy very much.
4,Good workout but annoying chatter,"This is the latest addition to my Leslie Sansone workout collection. What I like about the workout is that it's relatively brief (30 mins) and easy to do. The steps are very simple and the pace is moderate. Leslie works out in a nice location with four ladies who have also appeared in previous tapes. It is definitely not for the advanced exerciser, but it does the job when you don't have too much energy or when you're pressed for time. What I find annoying though is the INCESSANT chatter. Leslie does not stop talking and giggling through the entire program, and I wished the DVD had the option of ""music only"" without the instructor's voice. After doing the routine several times this can be a big turnoff. Othewise, Walk and Jog is a keeper."
4,Quick and Easy,"I like Leslie Sansones DVD's because I used to have chronic couchpotatoitis. If you aren't a die hard fitness junky her DVD's are easy to do and initially her bubbly persona does get you motivated and helps you get through the work out. Though I have had the Walk-away the Pounds series for years, I have not consistently used it until January 2007. I finally worked my way up to the 4 mile DVD and I bought the Walk/Jog DVD to have a change in my routine. Though, in time, Leslie's talking does get annoying, I think that any video/exercise routine that you use consistently will eventually get on your nerves. Though I don't think that there is sufficient stretching at the end of the workout, I like the video because according to Leslie, you walk/jog 2.5 miles in 30 minutes. It's convenient if you don't have a lot of time. The ultimate goal is to get your workout on and Leslie Sansones videos helps you do that."
5,Good Workout,"Another success from Leslie. She's the only one I workout with. I needed something to freshen up my collection. This is great. Love the intervals, makes it go by fast and for exercising, its pretty fun!"
2,Not my favortie,I love the Walk Away the Pounds series but this one has to be my list favorite. It's hard to follow and it just seems sparatic to me.
3,My least favorite,"I am a huge fan of Leslie Sansone, but out of all her videos this has to be my least favorite. I found these moves difficult to do on a carpeted floor and as a previous poster mentioned too sporadic. Because of this, I almost did not finish the workout, not because of the intensity level, but because it was frustrating trying to do the moves correctly on a carpeted floor. Anyway to make a long story short, I did not find this exercise to be too intense. I actually find the WATP 1, 2, and 3 miles more intense than these workouts, and I will be purchasing the 4 miles, because the basic WATP series seem to do it for me!"
3,Nice workout...Boring Atmosphere,"This video really gets you pumped up, but Leslie's assistants are REALLY boring in this video as compared to the ""Walk Away The Pounds 1,2 and 3-Mile"" walks. She does not interact with them, making it less fun for me. She is still motivational, but I found myself wishing it was over...NOW!"
1,Did not like at all,No problems with seller just did not care for this work out. I have her other work outs and love them but did not care for this at all. I would recommend sticking to her original work outs.
2,"Bummer this is the same ""walk and jog"" on other DVDs.","I like Leslie's videos but needed a little variety. Unfortunately, this is the same as the one included in the ""Fat Burning"" series. The other video includes four workouts, so it's a better deal."
5,Excellent 30 minute high impact workout,I actually purchased this DVD 2 months ago but I used it for the 1st time today!!! I loved it so much that I had to log right on and post this review.What I liked: It has low and high impact moves the entire time. It made me sweat and half the time of a full workout. It made Leslie sweat too LOL. The transition from high impact movement to jogging was good no great. . . I did not feel like I had to catch up because I never missed a move. The challenge is there to help not kill! People complain over and over about her music but I just want to work out with something that will keep me movingI can not say enough about this DVD. I can see myself easliy using it in the morning as well as in the evening as well. It is a wonderful workout for only 30 minutes . . . The ease of movements lets me know that I CAN do high impact and that I really need to bump of my workout.:^)If you like Leslie Sansone - this will be yet another favorite.
5,In A Word.....AWESOME!,"I have been exercising to Leslie Sansone ""Walking"" videos for several months now. I am currently at the 2 mile level, but am having problems ""getting over the hump"" to the 3 mile. If anyone is having that same problem, this is the video to get! This video is about 30 minutes of walking and light jogging. The walking/jogging intervals are spaced out nicely, so you have time to recover. Leslie also has one of the other ladies in the video doing just straight walking for anyone who is not going to jog. It's fast and it's fun! I highly recommend this video!"
5,Pleasantly Intense!,"I've done this workout twice so far, and I highly recommend it to those who want to add some variety to their Walk at Home collection!It's a 30 minute (2 miles) walk with her classic knee-lift, side-steps & kicks routine with added moves to keep it interesting! In leading up to the intense section, you begin walking back and forth. Then you start a gentle jog back and forth. Bouncy kicks are usually next. A new move is where you swing your leg from side to side. It takes me a second to get it down, but it's fun! The next time you do this particular move, you swing your arms from side to side alongside..side.Anyway! These jogging segments last 2 minutes and you perform them 4 times throughout the DVD.You're bound to recognize some or all of the faces she's brought with her & the time goes by in a flash!I have no problem motivating myself to pop this in the DVD player."
4,Challenging,I've been doing the 2 mile walk for a while. I wanted to challenge myself more but was not ready to do her 3 mile walk. Great workout video!
5,a good change of pace,This workout offers more variety than the other walk at home videos. It was a nice change to be able to do her short bursts of jogging. I really felt like I had accomplished something by doing this video. It also helps that she has someone to modify the workouts if you find you can't jog or boosted walking as she calls it.
5,Awesome,Really enjoyed working out with this one. I worried at first that I might not have been able to keep up with the jogging feature but Leslie makes it enjoyable.
4,New to running? Short on time?,"I only own two of Ms. Sansone's DVD's this title and the ""Four Mile Super Challenge."" Though I now use both rarely this title does not have an edge over the super challenge in my opinion unless one can only spare a half hour and/or desires a 2.5 mile run/walk.The familiar moves such as knee lifts, turns, side to side movements are all featured. The major difference in this collection are the minute fifty average jogging intervals, around every seven minutes.I believe this program is great for serious Sansone devotees, people unsure if they can up their walking pace or consumers such as myself who didn't know their running/jogging pace time when they took their first steps towards running as serious exercise.A solid DVD and great for the beginner."
3,I like the 4 mile walk better,I was expecting a lot given that this workout is supposed to be for more advanced people... but I felt like the four mile workout gets me more into a sweat than this one. I'm glad to have it for variety and that I read other people's reviews of this before purchasing so my expectations weren't too high.
1,REPEAT WITH DIFFERENT PKG!!,"This was very disappointing! Made out to be a ""new"" dvd! The only thing new is the cover and a brief talk from Leslie. I have this one already and VERY SHOCKED by Sansone!!! There should be a warning that this is the same workout as before only you are missing 2 workouts that were on the original DVD!!!! Will have a very hard time purchasing any more Sansone DVD which I own around 8 and was wanting something ""new"". I thought she was a Christian! See what fame gets you"
4,"The workout is great; Leslie's jabbering, well....","I have many of Leslie Sansone's WATP workout DVDs, and my complaint about all of them is the same -- would someone please tell Leslie to stop jabbering. It really detracts from the workout and I spend a lot of energy trying to focus on the workout and tune out her irritating laugh, jabbering, and nonsensical comments. I am doing other workout DVDs more because people like Denise Austin ""talk"" about the workout and give instruction on how to do it instead of the babbling about any and everything that Leslie does!"
5,Jog or Walk Super Fast?,"I like this one too, the only thing is I can't jog very well because it starts to hurt my ankels and it also hurts my chest, but you can modify this video so you can walk VERY fast, the music is fast, very upbeat, so when you come to the jogging intervels it isn't hard to keep up if your just walking. I tried it this way and I still worked up a good sweat and my heartrate was rasied, it's an awesome workout!"
2,Walk Away the Pounds,"This is a good workout for beginners, only. It was not at all challenging to me, too slow. I like the upbeat group workouts better. I really like Leslie, and I like the caring attitude she projects."
4,"Pretty good, but I prefer the Walk & Kick video","This video didn't do as well at keeping me interested and pumped up - it was kind of repetitive. I ordered this one and the Walk & Kick at the same time, and I definitely recommend the Walk & Kick. The kickboxing moves are new and fun. While both videos are challenging, the kickboxing one seemed to fly by because you're doing totally different moves, instead of just going from a walk to a jog."
4,"Fun, quick and it works","I tried this walk/jog workout out because I like the Power Mile so much but really do find it too short for a lot of situations.This is a great combination of Leslie's walking steps with intervals of jogging throughout. It will get your heartrate up and make you feel fantastic.Three weeks of this and I feel so much better. I have lost some weight and I have a lot more energy...and I was pretty active before.Check it out of the library or order it off Netflix first, but I'm sure you'll want to own it eventually."
4,Walk and Jog (this will make you sweat),"I just tried my walk and jog workout and really enjoyed it. This dvd was a really good workout. It offers Leslie's same great workouts but in this one she kicks it up a bit for a challange. She has Mary Kay doing the workout with no joging for those who aren't ready. The set is better than her 1 mile power walk. The music is a bit different and they don't cordinate their outfits at all. Amazons price is great, on Leslie's website she only offers this workout on video and for more money. overall I liked it and recomend it."
4,Good but easy,"This is a good workout for the beginner or intermediate. The choreography is very simple. For more advanced exercisers, this would be good for light days. The jogging is slow and relaxed. You lightly jog for about 8 minutes during this 30 minute routine."
4,GREAT WORKOUT,"I really like this video. The steps are very easy to follow unlike most other ones I have tried. I just got this recently and have only done it once, but I felt like I got a really good workout when I was done and it went by very fast. The only problem I have is the jogging part is kind of hard on the chest. It was alot of fun, and I will probably start alternating this video with some others that I have of hers. I would recommend this video to anyone."
4,Great for Advanced Walkers,"For those that have been following Leslie a long time, this is the next step. Sometimes you don't want to have to do the 45 minute workout to get a challenge, but the 15 and 30 minute workouts have become to easy. This is the answer to that problem. The jogging added raises your heart rate and makes you feel like you got a good workout. I wouldn't recommend this workout to those with joint problems like knees or hips. The jumping around for the jogging would not be good on the joints."
2,Misleading size description,"I was looking for a grill grate that was no larger than 16.5"" from side to side, and this posting claimed that the grill grate measured 16.5"" in diameter. That is not an accurate measurement. The grill measures 16.5"" INSIDE of the external circle, and 17"" in diameter when measured from end to end. I need this grate to fit INSIDE of a 16.5"" flower pot, which this certainly will not do. Very displeased with the seller on this."
3,Spend 2 bucks more,It's a good replacement but for $2 you can get the hinged one that is so much better.
3,Mediocre Display,"I received this as a gift for my Birthday and was really impressed with the brightness. Then I tried to knock it down a little. Now I know what to look for in an LCD monitor. The contrast ratio on this display is a bit low for my tastes.If you do a great deal of Word, Excel, and the like, this is a great monitor. If your into photo/video editing or gaming, go get a Samsung or a Viewsonic. The contrast ratio and the lights/darks are much better compared to the 1970VX. I was also surprised when I saw the price. Honestly, for this price, you can do much much better."
5,Excellent resource for those just starting out,"I originally wanted the newest edition of this book but I couldn't afford it. So I opted for the 11th edition and I love it! I am just starting out in the food service industry cooking for approximately 60 students at an elementary school. This book has been a great resource for recipes, calculations and basic how to's when cooking for that many. I would highly recommend this book to anyone cooking for 50 or more."
5,A vital MUST HAVE handbook for professionals!,"Whether one is cooking in a restaurant or a school kitchen, this is the most valuable handbook. You'll want it at ready reference. I know, because never a week went by that I didn't consult it while running my bakery/deli in the Oregon Cascades.I must confess that I didn't tell customers my recipe source. I preferred they think me a genius or as having come from a family steeped in cooking history. They knew I was no genius (hell, they knew I wasn't even very smart) but they did like the foods we provided. And, when I decided to produce a new, tasty meat pie, it was this book that I consulted to improve upon my concept.Choose not to buy this book and you probably are never going to know what you don't know. Choose not to consult it while it sets on your shelf will probably endanger your relationship with your harshest critics."
5,Food for Fifty,I have used this book for over 50 years but had not bought a new edition for some time. It is VASTLY improved and will be an asset to me in my work as a Registered Dietitian.
4,I liked it,"I had to buy this book for my Quantity Foods course as a part of my Dietetics major. I actually liked the book, and I am going to keep it for later use. I thought the book was organized very well. Some of the charts in Chapter 2 and 5 that we used quite often were a little hard to find (because there are so many!).It also presented a good overview of things you wouldn't think would be in the book, such as the school lunch program, etc.I liked it!"
4,Food for Fifty Cook Book,"TheFood for Fifty (12th Edition)cook book is a good reference book for an institutional kitchen. It has some HACCP information , as well as numerous charts and guides to serving,portioning and preparing food."
2,Poor Quality,"The front portion of this steel brush wore down after only 2-3 cleanings, as has the rest of the brush as I switched from side to side. I am surprized that Weber would have such a poor product produced (in China, as I recollect)."
5,A versatile brush,"You can't have too many grill brushes in your life. This one can tackle the worst grill build-up with ease. Also, if you're a professional animal trainer or zookeeper, it works great for brushing those elephant tusks and rhino horns. Just don't try to scratch the rhino's nuts with it. They're a little sensitive about that since this brush has brass metal bristles. I found that out the hard way. Try using a brush with nylon bristles for that instead. The scraper feature is also possibly useful for veterinarians for performing D & C's (if you don't know, don't ask) on large animals like livestock."
2,A nice grill brush - but ...,"The Weber 1647 18"" grill brush is certainly a nice looking grill brush, and performs quite well for awhile. (bought in March'04; this is June '04. Today, I was cleaning my Weber Q, and noticed brass bristles all over the grill where they had come out of the brush. Needless to say, I didn't want brass bristles in my food, so the next half-hour was spent cleaning up from the brush. Weber should have attached the bristles better to the handle head. There was also a problem with the bristles really being too short to clean the cast iron grates."
3,It does the job,"It is a brush like most on the market. they clean the grates.Nothing bad about it, and nothing outstanding. When they wear out buy another."
3,Just a brush with a nice handle and the Weber logo.,"After buying my first Weber, I was so impressed with both the build quality of the grill and customer service, I was an instant 'Weber fanboy' and so I bought the stainless 3 piece toolset (now thats built tough!) and the Weber grill brush. After past experience with cheaper brass brushes ($1-$2) flattening in no time I expected (one reviewer here claimed it to be so anyway) this would be different. It's not different, just a bigger handle. It would seem brass is brass, and whatever you have experienced in the past for any brass brush applies to this one as well.Seems such a waste to discard just because the bristles go flat..I might try a very similiar model (not Weber) that has a replaceable head, although the price difference seems meager."
4,"Pretty good brush, could be excellent with some slight modifications","I've had the same brush for 4 years now. This brush is great. The wooden handle is sturdy, doesn't heat up, and is long enough that you can clean your grill while it's hot (how I usually do it) My one complaint with it is since there is no angle at the head, you end up putting the brush at an angle (since you can't hold it perpendicular to the grill as that would defeat the point of the 18"" handle) which means only the bristles at the very front get used. My brush has the front brass bristles worn down and full of grill gunk but 2/3rds of the bristles in the back look brand new. If the head of the brush was at an angle to the handle this brush would be way better.That said, it's still a good brush.Be careful though as it seems Amazon is combining the reviews between the version of this brush that has brass bristles with the version with steel bristles."
4,Very good grill brush,"I have only minimal complaints after using this. If the brush had a firmer gripping surface, it might make for a little easier brushing. For that fact alone, I dropped it a full star.Don't get me wrong; this is a GREAT BRUSH! If you are looking for something good to scrape your grill with, this won't hurt. However, I personally would make a few improvements, only to the gripping area."
5,A brilliant tool and a tip how to clean it,"This brush is brilliant. It doesn't ruin your grate like other steel brushes does (this one is not made of steel/iron). So it'll save you the frustration of buying a new grate because the other rusts.Heres a tip on how to clean it. Mix a bowl of warm water with wash machine soap or a tab. Leave the head of the brush in the water overnight and behold - almost as good as new. Over time the wood/handle near the head will lose its protection, but rather that than an ugly brush :-)"
2,Fair grill brush,"The brush works well to clean the grill, but the scraper is too small to be useful."
4,Grill Brush,"I am very happy with this brush. I like how there is a groove at the tip of the brush for scrapping the grill, and the brush section does a nice job as well. The long handle is handy too."
3,"Brush okay, scraper useless",This brush works fine but the scraper element on the tip is too small to fit over the bars on my weber grill. So the only way to clean the grill is to brush and brush and brush whereas just one scrape with a fitted scraper would do a much better job. At least it cleans up easily - just rinse with warm soapy water.
1,Doesn't clean well,"Bought this brush to use with my Weber Grill. The bristles don't go deep enough to clean between the grates and the metal tip for doing this is useless, as it doesn't fit between the grates either."
3,It's a Grill Brush,"It's a grill brush. It works fine, but is no different than any other one you can find."
2,not that good,If you have a webber gas grill the steel slot on the brush is useless - it is sized to clean the thinner wire type grill. Also the bristles are not that heavy duty.I would have given it only one star but it is so inexpensive - I guess you get what you pay for.
3,it's okay,"The brush seems sturdy enough. HOwever, I found better grill brush at a hardware store that is cheaper and you can change the brush head after it wears out. It's also cheaper too!"
4,Great quality,The item is great quality and will last for a long time. Does exactly what I intended it to do.
3,"Good, but...","The concept behind the Weber Grill Brush is excellent. The brass bristles are tough enough to remove cindered remains (Burn it on high to ash, first) without scratching the porcelain cooking grate. The execution, howvever, is less than perfect in that the bristols are not quite long enough to easily reach material stuck to the lower portion of the grate.My own example had a more significant flaw: The wood handle broke in two mid-way thru the first season of use. This was less surprising when I examined it closely and saw that the break was on a knot in the wood.To Weber's credit a call to their 800 number brought a quick replacement."
4,Great brush!,"This brush is just awesome, and a good price to boot! Works perfect with my Weber Q grill."
2,over-rated!,"i cannot believe Weber put their name on this! bristles don't hold up. after about 10 cleanings, it looks like my old brush (that lasted a whole summer)"
5,Nice length and quality,... the overall length of this brush makes it safe and comfortable to cleanup a grill whether it be a Weber or other make. It also has a metal plate at the top of the brush which has a rounded section to scrape individual grate bars.
2,Save your money,This product isn't worth the money or time - you can get a brush at any discount store for less $$ and it'll do the job just as well.
1,Waste of money only lasts a few weeks,I purchased this item when I bought the grill. It was useless after a few time of use. Purchased one at TJ Maxx for about $6.00 that is still in perfect shape after several years. Don't waste your money.
3,Short Lifespan,"The bristles we're very quick to flatten when force applied for my stainless grates...while the handle itself is very well made, it will claim dirt very easily as mentioned elsewhere. Scraper on tip is generally useless due to shape on my Weber.When it comes down to it, I need a brush stronger than the brass used on this model, but still an excellent value as currently priced."
2,Short life for this grill brush.,"The third time I used this brush it broke. The wood split diagonally at the neck of the brush, a little before where the bristles start. I now have the perfect implement with which to stake a vampire. My other Weber brush (which I purchased at a diff. website) is still intact and works okay. You see the bristles are a little gunked up -that's why I bought this second grill brush. -Buyers, and Vampires, beware!"
3,Lot's of Flames,"I agree with Greg from Denver - the Weber product is not the quality you would expect from Weber. My grill has a hot spot in the back left side - while the other areas are not as hot. I have multiple times cleaned the entire BBQ and I still get flares shooting up - they said they will not have flames, but when I open the lid the flames are out of control and flare up to 3/4 feet!!! I have even burned the hairs on my beard and arms too many times!! I continually have to dose the flames with water. You have to always check the flames - what a drag!!! If you do not watch the flames every few minutes, the meat will be burned and you will have everyone at the BBQ staring at you and thinking what an idiot!! He can't even BBQ meat with burning it!!"
2,Not the product it used to be!!,"Weber is cutting out the quality in thier products, my bbq I bought last year is not as good as the weber I used to have, I should have shopped artound more, other grill are now taking over. But it's not badGreg"
4,Nice,I ordered 2 of these boxes for my kids for Christmas. They were a little smaller than I expected but they are nice wood boxes. My kids like to have a secret box in their room to put their stuff in. I would recommend this product.
3,Nostalgia appeal,"It was nice to finally read this storyline in a collected edition. I had most of these issues as a kid, but never got the whole story. It's not the best of the Avengers, but it's a decent read, esp for fans of the Avengers bronze age."
3,"Old school, which explains a lot about the story","This was a funner time in comics, campier and much more ""Shakespearean"" than we see today. Unfortunately, I am so used to the modern comic, looking back on this piece of the 70's, I can't really get too into it. They did a great job with the recoloring and it was a fun overall idea. The main problem was it made both teams seem like little children, who don't seem to think before they act. Dr. Strange comes out looking like an idiot, which is just wrong. The fights though, were fun and actually made some sense. The dialogue was too campy, and there were those cute little references they used to always make everywhere (i.e. ""check out Avengers 145, bravo Bob - Timmy). I don't really regret buying this, but I know that I probably won't read it again. You just have to have a real appreciation for the comics of the past, and this is just before my time."
1,Overpriced!!!!,Amazon overpriced these...go to hasbro's website and find it for 5.99. This is really disappointing that Amazon would overprice this item. We are use to Amazon having better prices but I guess this just isn't so any more.
5,*LOVE IT*,"Love it!!! The food is actually the consistancy of real baby food. When it is time for a diaper change, it really looks like baby poop. Great. Nice price tag as well."
5,Django on my mind,"I'm a fan of Pat Green, Robert Earl Keen, Roger Creager, and other Texas country artists, and I love Django Walker. Texas On My Mind, which Django wrote, has been covered by all his buddies, each one being a little different and special.His voice, besides having the necessary country twang, is a Texas plains rough, similar to that of Jerry Jeff. His guitar playing is beautiful.Django's got talent, and a fan of Texas country would be happy with this purchase."
3,Django Walker-Up and Coming,"A slight mix of Texan Country and Rock, Down the Road is a refreshing sound for a young artist and band. I recommend it for those people who enjoy lyrics with a direction."
1,Pathetic,His voice is mediocre and his songwriting is childish. The song Texas On My Mind that everyone is raving about has no discernable melody.Utter trash
1,The Apple Fell Far From The Tree & Then Rolled...,"Even though his pappy's a semi-famous songwriter and has a respectable following, this kid got none of the humor, wry-eye insight, or (limited) vocal ability of dear ol' dad.The songs are cliche' and the singing is altogether uninspiring. If I wasn't so dang sure this guy was from Texas, I'd guess he was one of those fall-in-line musicians who have taken the long dusty trail (from parts otherwise) to Texas to strike it rich as ""Texas singer-songwriters"".A disappointment through and through.I'll stick to Shaver, REK, and Steve Earle. The REAL Texas geniuses."
4,Texas on my mind,"You sit here and make fun of Texas country becasue you probably listen to Pat Green. Yeh, i used to like pat green until he sold out to Nashville, you cant sing about not liking nashville and writing songs about texas, and then go to Nashville. Green has lost a loyal following in texas from a lot of people. We support the smaller guys like walker and i would rather buy there CD's over nashville followers."
2,not very good,Not a very good ending. A lot of questions left unanswered. Ends abrubtly. Stayed pretty close to the book though.
5,Works great replaced a work horse,"This mouse replaced a mouse I have been using for 5 years. It works great and I can't complain about anything. My wife would tell you ""that's hard to believe""."
2,Mouse Wheel Broke,"There's not a whole lot to say. At first it worked fine. But then, and for no apparent reason, the mouse wheel's scrolling function stopped. I opened it up and nothing is broken; it just doesn't work. I value above all RELIABILITY in hardware. A mouse isn't something I should have to buy every year."
2,Sometimes you get what you pay for,"...and sometimes you don't. Nothing wrong with the mouse on arrival. Cheap and cheerful. Several months on, it's tracking poorly and the cursor skipping. Very fussy about what surface it's used on (mousepad is best) and too much or too little pressure causes it to simply stop tracking. It's either got gunk/dust in the lens or a loose wire. Whatever it is, it's not happy. At the price of a new one, it's not worth shipping back for repair/replacement. Standard disposable item.Trouble is, the two Kensington basic USB mice I ordered at the same time are working perfectly still (we bought 3 different mice to compare them in the office), cost about $2 less, and have vastly superior software (particularly on the Macs). I'd vote against this one."
2,scroll wheel hell,"As with a previous reviewer, this mouse seemed to work fine then all of a sudden, the scroll wheel stopped working properly. It would work for a few pages (web or offline text documents) then just stop, or do stupid things. Changing settings, running troubleshooters, changing ports and reinstalling software resulted in exactly the same problems. I put my old mouse back on and am taking this two-month old mouse back to W..-M...t."
5,A Decent Optical Mouse at a Bargain Price,"You can pay more for other corded optical mice, but this one is hard to beat. This is the second of these mice that I have purchased...my original one has worked faultlessly on my Windows 2000 PC for over a couple of years, and the second one is now on a Windows XP PC with equal results. I would not hesitate to recommend this product."
3,What in the world is goingon with this mouse?,I have had this mouse for 4 months. It was working great until 2 days ago where the left click stopped responding alltogether. i would have to right click and hold in order for me to access a window and then it i just used the keyboard to navigate. I had to re-install the software and seemed to do the trick. Pain in the butt. I hope it doesn't happen again. Now i just have to press HARD on my left click in order for it to respond at all. I am frustrated.
4,Nice mouse for nice price,"What can I say, it works fine. This is my second MS optical mouse, the blue color is better than the old white one."
4,Good Choice for the price!,"I have had the product for about 2 months and it was a great buy for the price, it fits my hand and the scroll wheel reacts well...I would give it 5 stars but I work on a mac and the spotlight feature isn't compatible."
4,Microsoft optical mouse,Worked effortlessly. No problems in month sice I got it. Good value for price. The always-on red light could be annoying to some.
4,I dislike nearly everything about Microsoft...,"... but I like their mice. I have a simple basic MS optical mouse for use with my laptop, but I wanted something just a bit nicer for my desktop computer, an iMac G5. The mouse works great, but it does have a little trouble with any surface that's partly reflective. Just keep it on a flat matte pad and you shouldn't have any problems."
1,Junk,"Mouse tracking works fine, even without a pad as it should. However, the wheel quit working on mine 10 days after I bought it. I took it back to Wal*art and bought a logitech optical ""Click!"" mouse which works great."
2,It's great- until it breaks,"I don't know what I did to deserve this. This mouse was comfortable, scrolled well, and worked very well in video games. Just yesterday, however, the wheel started acting funny- when I scrolled down, it would scroll up, then down, then random text would be highlighted. Now, it's worse- Even a left click will mean that the arrow is stuck to some scrollbar somewhere, more text gets highlighted, icons are flying across the screen because the button release isn't registered properly. I guess I do exaggerate a bit, but seriously, folks, this mouse, after half a year, has ceased to be functional in a normal sense. For the record, I have never abused this mouse. I am certain that the problem was not software related, as it does the same thing on my other computer. Both the USB and PS/2 adapter do the same thing.I do not recommend this mouse to the mentally unstable."
2,Begins well... but later on... ehhh...,"Well, here's the thing. I liked this mouse when I first got it. After all, its optical, it feels nice on my hand, and controls well.But later on down the road...The track ball has gotten stuck. Don't know how, don't know why, but when scrolling, it gets to a point and STICKS. This is extremely frustrating when playing online video games where speed is essential.This, in itself, wouldn't be much of a problem if there was a way to open it and clean it. But... there's none. No screws, nothing that pops off... its just one solid unit.So, if you're looking for a temporary mouse, then this might be for you. But if you want one that will last more than 3 months... look elsewhere."
2,"Cord is coming loose from mouse, paint rubbing off","After using it for about 6 months, the cord had become really loose where it connects to the mouse, and the paint rubbed off where my hand is most often. I felt the cord may be affecting its performance some, so I have since retired it."
3,Scroll wheel doesn't light up,"Microsoft makes it look like the scroll wheel lights up, but it doesn't. They sure try to make it look like it does. Other than that, It's a nice-looking mouse that works fine."
5,Computer Mouse,"Purchased two of the Microsoft optical mouse, both work very well, and after a month of daily use I have found that it does all that I want. Nothing special but this is what I wanted."
2,Poor design,"Although I like the feel of the buttons and especially the wheel, the mouse does not sit comfortably in my hand for longer periods. It is too narrow in the middle (as well as to high), forcing the thumb and ring finger to hold it in an unnatural and strained way. Instead, I recommend a wider and flatter mouse, such as Logitech's optical mouse (which is also cheaper)."
2,Just an okay mouse... I can't recommend it,"After using it at work for a few hours, my hand began to hurt a bit. I have medium (men's) hands, but not sure if hand size matters. I think the high arch is the cause of the discomfort. Note that I also own the Microsoft Wireless Optical Mouse Blue, and it does NOT have the same problem - I can actually recommend that one.The mouse feels cheaper than other Logitech and Microsoft mice I've owned, but is certainly sturdy enough to last. Also, the scroll wheel is too loose making it easy to scroll accidentally while trying to only press the wheel (center) button. Most people probably won't care about that feature (I happen to need the middle mouse button for my Unix applications at work).I've been using the mouse as a travel mouse and it does it's job. This mouse is still better than any non-optical mouse since I can use it on any surface (I don't need to carry around a mouse pad)."
5,I like it very much!,"I bought this mouse to replace an old, and much bigger, microsoft optical mouse. I like the smaller size and pretty blue color. It tracks well, and was really easy to install. This would be a great mouse for a child or someone like me with small hands!"
2,ok but flawed,"Liked the mouse for about a month, then the cheap quality material started to decay...The main problem is with the battery compartment, the spring connection for the battery circuit will twist and become unusable...was constantly having to adjust the batteries to get it to work...so I took a hammer to it and bought a Logitech MX 700 which is FANTASTIC...made with very good quality material and also operates with a rechargeable battery. Microsoft needs to stick to memory hogging operating systems with tons of security flaws and leave the PC accessories to other companies..."
4,Works Fine,"What more can I say than it works just fine. Truly plug and play under XP home. I will have to get used to the scroll wheel, it moves very easily compared to others that I have owned."
3,For those people with a high-arched mouse.,"Well yes, I've found alot of the Microsoft mice to have a higher arch to them then most, now for some people this is uncomfortable. I would suggest for those people to either get a Wrist pad, to help your wrist and to have it higher off the table then usual so the high-arched mouse doesn't cause you pain, now you get the Wrist-Pad from Everglide.com or you could get a mouse pad, with a wrist-pad built into it already. Kingston and few other companys make em, should beable to find em just about anywhere, BestBuy, CompUSA, OfficeDepot and Amazon.com"
2,Suffers From Opitcal Jitter,"This was my first optical mouse. Unfortunately, I soon learned about optical ""jitter"". I was unable to get smooth curser movements for small hand movements involving editing of digital photos, etc. Small movements cause noticeable curser jitter on the screen. Do an internet search using ""optical mouse jitter"" and you will see this is a common problem for optical mice.I've since replaced it a Logitech MX310, which has no such problem. The Logitech moves across the screen smoothly - and seems to glide across the mouse pad easier. Of course the MX310 is more expensive - but worth it.If you don't do a lot of precise/fine work - then I suppose the ""optical mouse blue"" is OK."
5,some thoughts so unlike my own,"This books have some thought I could not have known on my own. During my daily commute back home, I ponder of them."
5,YET ANOTHER GREAT EDITION,Roger's absence for the last 5 or so months only makes you value this book more. Not being able to get his opinion before going to a movie or even missing his bi-weekly Answer Man column has pretty much driven me nuts.Here's hoping his recovery goes by quickly !
1,Wears out fast,"The bristles appear to be copper and the entire brush becomes flat, coated, and useless extremely fast. Also, the bristles can come off the brush and can stick to your food or be stuck into a piece of meat, which is very bad."
1,don't bother,really - don't bother. You will be much better served with a steel wire brush from the hardware store that is made for tough jobs. I tried this grill bush and another grill brush before I saw a friend using the steel brush - it does a much better job and does not wear out.
3,better than the dollar store ones,This brush is better than the cheap ones at the dollar store but it's too short.
3,Well built but too short,"If your grill is on when you use this brush you will feel the heat. I recommend the longer 18"" model."
4,Works well with the BabyQ,I've used this brush about 15 times with my Weber BabyQ grill. The scraper at the top is nice as it cleans the BabyQ grates well. The brush is OK - it cleans but the bristles have a tendency to fall out the more you use it. I give it 4 stars because it has lasted longer than I expected it to and still has some life left in it. Subtract 1 star because of the bristles falling out.
3,Matted down mush,Our brush is fair matted down after two years. It became matted right away. We possibly did not follow the directions.
4,Great value,"This little scraper is perfect for all grills, the brass brissles are stronger and better than those greeny-meanies, but soft enough for porceline coated grills unlike the steel bristle ones which will scratch. Great tool, but a little short for those on-the-fly !HOT! scrapes."
5,"Great Product - Works as advertized, lasts a long time","I purchased a Weber Genesis BBQ two years ago and bought one of these brush / scrapers (and a cover) at the same time. It does a great job cleaning the grill and lasts me a full BBQ season (I BBQ a LOT). As stated below, crank up the heat on your grill, give it a few minutes to get real hot, then scrape off the previous sessions' remnants. The metal tip at the end gets way down between the grates, and the bristles really clean the grill. Just get it (they're cheap) and you're set for another season of delicious adventures..."
2,The brushes fell out on the first use,This item is not expensive but please.......upon the first use the brass (looking) brushes started falling out. Regardless of how cheap you want to make something - It must perform its duty - this item did not. Too much headache and effort to get a replacement / refund which is usually the case with these type of items
1,Bit down on my burger and a peice of the bursh went through my mouth!,"OUCH!!!!!!!!!While the groove portion is nice because it macthes the angles of my Baby Q, I won't use the brush portion anymore. After cleaning the grill I threw some burgers on. Apparently some of the brushes fell off and as I was chewing my burger, a peice of of brush went through the roof of my mouth and had to be extracted by tweezers.I would use this only as a scraper, because that was a very, very painful experience."
2,bristles falling out,"I bought this to replace a WalMart-purchased scraper that lasted several years before starting to fall apart. Unfortunately, this Weber brush was shedding bristles after just a couple of uses. And not just one at a time -- entire groups of bristles are coming out. I have to blow on the grill after scraping to make sure I don't get brass cooked into my chicken.It still works, technically, but it won't be long before I'll have to replace the replacement. The scraper part works well on my Weber Baby Q."
1,POSSIBLY THE WORST BRUSH I HAVE EVER OWNED,"Why is this a bad brush? The bristles are cheap and they do not remove any gunk from the grill. If anything, these metal bristles will destroy the finish of your grill grates. Weber is awesome 99% of the time. This brush is part of the 1%."
5,GOOD CHRISTMASGIFT,"WE HAVE GRILLS ,THEY AREHARD TO CLEANAND ITHINK THE MENLATER MIGHTAPPRECIATEONE OF THESEBRUSHES>"
4,Get the Gold Version!,I love this grill! Putting this grill together was easy. There is plenty of room on the platform. At time I think that it would be nice to have the top grate that is hinged and lifts up part way. I don't think the hinged replacement grate would work with the chimney starter (an absolute requirement!). The only downside to this grill is ash containment. The tray below is messy. If I had to do this all over again I would purchase the gold version that has the ash containment system.
4,I love the kettle,"This is my third Weber. I loathe cooking on gas, it just isn't the same. As for the extra time for the coals to heat up, I just enjoy a glass of vino while I wait.One negative for this grill is the lightweight cooking grill. I don't really need the sides that lift up, but the older grills had larger diameter rods.I can't wait until next week to cook my turkey, but I have to."
5,Probably the best stand by bbq you could own,"I've been using Weber Kettle for about 20 years now, and this basic design has yet to be duplicated for it's ease of use and consistent cooking. I use both Gas and wood/charcoal and I would never give up my Weber kettle. I use it more than I do the Gas grill."
1,Caution Beware,"At first I thought the grill was great until I paid close attention and noticed one thing. The grill top does not even fit over the whole grill!!!! So when I leave my fire shoots up and gets too hot. Also the handle on the top can get extremely hot and make you drop it and burn yourself which has also happened to me. maybe I am the only one, but this grill has been nothing but trouble for me. Never again."
5,Still a Great Barbecue!,"I got one of these almost thirty years ago as a wedding gift. After using it for ten years we switched to a gas barbecue for the convenience. After wearing out three gas units, we have purchased a new Weber and love it. It is easy to use, inexpensive, and the food tastes much better with a charcoal barbecue. They improved the intake vent setup and ash pan from our original model. Other than that it is the same and works just as well."
5,Best Buy/Value in Charcoal Grills (and a Classic),"If you are considering a charcoal grill, look no further. This is the Classic Kettle charcoal grill from Weber. Be sure and spend a little extra to get the extra grilling room that the 22.5 inch surface offers. This is the grill that all the charcoal grilling books use. You simply cannot beat a classic like the Weber Kettle charcoal grill. If you are planning on using it for indirect cooking, you MUST opt for the 22.5 inch grill as it will give you more space to spread out the coals so you don't accidentally cook with direct heat."
5,Ditto,"There is no use in repeating everybody else's words, so I will simply endorse all positive reviews by reference. A great grill, period."
4,It's ok.,"Still not sold on the price tag though. I feel it could be somewhat cheaper, considering the materials involved in it's manufacture and what it does."
5,Great Grill!,"I prefer the one touch silver to the one touch gold, because you never have trouble remembering when the ashes need to be dumped.This size is great for the indirect method of cooking and for large groups. However, if you only cook using the direct method of cooking or are only cooking for up to 4-5 people, I would suggest getting the 18.5 inch version to save on charcoal. Heating the whole grill requires a good bit of charcoal (generally around 3-4 pounds for this size).I have no complaints about this grill, when combined with a Chimney starter it is perfect!"
5,Buy a Weber!,Don't be like me and try to get by with $15 kettle grills from Walmart or Big Lots. Spend the money and get a Weber!
2,"Looks great, low quality.","I bought this grill to replace a Weber I have had for over 5 years and aside from normal wear it has functioned well. This grill I have had for exactly 2 weeks and today the side handle detached from the grill when I went to move the grill. I examined the old grill and saw around 1/2"" of weld connecting the handle to the grill. The new one I purchased has less than 1/8"" of weld on each side of the handle and already was showing signs of bad rusting. I have contacted Weber in the hopes of a replacement. My only other complaint about this grill is that all of the internal grate supports had to be bent and adjusted to hold the grates without them rattling, it only took a minute but I think the same minute task could be completed by their staff."
5,"Weber 741001 22.5-Inch One-Touch Silver Kettle Grill, Black","i've tried different grills but they rust out an the top an lower air vents you can adjust the cooking temp. easily with just a few times after using it, where to set your vents for the air draft, recommend to everybody"
1,DANGER BURN HAZARD!! This is a hazardous product!!!!!,"I have owned at least 6 Weber kettles in 40 years of grilling. The current plastic used for the lid handles conducts heat unsafely and can burn your hand as if it were made of bare metal!!! I couldn't believe the blister I got from raising the lid to look at what i was cooking. I thought i had made a mistake and touched the metal or maybe the screw that holds the handle on had come in contact with my skin. No, i checked and it was the plastic handle!SHAME ON WEBER-STEVENS FOR MAKING THIS PRODUCT AND NOT RECALLING OR REPLACING THESE UNSAFE HANDLES!!!These grills are the best for the price and just about any price for cooking, but i guess it's worth injuring your faithful customers severely to save a dollar or two. And apparently it is better to lose a reputation earned over decades rather than owning up to your mistakes."
5,why mess with less ?,"for me, this grill is the sweet spot. charcoal taste, quality construction, ease of use, well-deserved weber reputation, and reasonable price.i love my weber, and use it much more than other grills i've had. works like a champ.weber support was flawless when i needed them.one nit : the ash pan is a nice feature, but attachment is a bit awkward, like it was an afterthought. no big deal though.btw, be sure to get a chimney starter--makes charcoal grilling SO much easier. i'd have bought the weber one if it hadn't been sold out where i got my grill."
3,They Don't Make 'Em Like They Used To,"Recently purchased this grill. With the exception of the grate that holds the charcoal, the thickness of the metal of the grill and the grate that holds the food was much thinner than that of my older grill of the same model/type. The plastic handle on the lid, as another reviewer noticed, definitely gets hot to the touch, unlike the wooden handle on the older version. The food grate has large openings on the sides near its handles which allow for food to fall into the charcoal if one is not careful. It is possible that this grill will last a long time like my older model did, even with the thinner metal (time will tell), but I was somewhat dissappointed with the quality and slight design changes."
5,Weber 22 1/2 inch One- Touch Gold Grill,"Re- introduced myself to charcoal.This product is well made, well designed and works wonderfully.Makes cooking fun again.Amazon has the best price, easy ordering and includes free 2-day shipping as well. I buy most everything online and shop for best price with Google.Amazon is Unbeatable."
5,great grill for your backyard!,assembling this grill is a piece of cake and barely takes any time whatsoever. as long as you have a hammer and a screwdrive ready to go you can be finished in 20 minutes. this grill is charcoal and does not use any disgusting lighter fluid. charcoal is the real way to grill. this grill has an excellent air filtration system and your shish kebob coms out absolutely amazing and delicious. the only problem is the weak legs. check it out...!
3,The 1 - touch Weber grill,"While this grill does an excellent job of cooking various meals I now wish I had foreseen the following:1 - no side table to place the food both before and after cooking2 - no place to hang your barbecue utensils3 - the lid has no hinge meaning you have to set the cover aside every time you need access4 - assembly was not so easyHowever, in its' defense, the meats I've barbecued have come out excellent! Very thourough and evenly cooked food.All in all, for the price it's a decent bargain."
3,Not Good Enough,"I've heard about the wonderful Weber grill for so long and we finally purchased one. I am so disappointed in this grill. The metal is so thin, it feel flimsy! There is no way to adjust the height of the cooking surface, closer to the heat or further from the heat. It takes a lot more charcoal to get the heat I want. We had a much less expensive no name grill that finally rusted out in the bottom, but thankfully we had not thrown it out yet. It is of a heavier metal with a hinged lid, adjustable height cooking surface, better air control and just feels like a better grill. I will re-pan the bottom and put this Weber in a yard sale!"
5,Weber is Great,"You can't beat the taste of a Ribeye cooked on a Weber grill over charcoal. Hands down it beats a gas grill every time. For faster ready coals, get a weber chimney."
3,"good grill, poor quality construction.","I have used the grill 4 times now. The wheels have fallen off and the legs don't stay in the base. It is not designed to be moved around at all, even if you want to clean your BBQ area down, be careful when moving the grill as it falls apart far too easily. Don't get me wrong, it does a fine job of the cooking part. I don't see it holding up more than a year or two with this lack of integrity in it's overall construction. I will end up re-engineering the legs and wheels so as to keep them in place permanently. Something I despise is having to tweak another manufacturers product just to make it right. Oh, and one more annoyance, then I'm done, I promise. The cheap plastic handles are the worst thing weber could have done to ""improve"" the product. They get way too hot, not like the old wooden handles that the previous models have on them."
1,Weber quailty has plummeted.,"I used to swear by the Weber as the best quality charcoal grill available. Sadly, this is no longer the case. I purchased a new 22"" Weber last spring and it was genuine junk. After a few months the interior cover paint began to peel badly and a month or so later two of the three grill supports began to pull away from the side of the kettle. By fall it was unusable. I'd stay away until quality returns. They got 1 star from me only because zero is not an option."
3,Neat Idea - Extremely hard to find accessories,"When we bought this dollhouse for our girls, it came with a little ""magazine"" advertising extra accessories - parents' bedroom, kitchen, dining room, bathroom, etc, etc. Unfortunately, most of these accessories are hard to find."
3,POSSIBLE DISCONTINUATION ON ACCSESSORIES,"I AM SO UNBELIEVABLY DISAPPOINTED WITH FISHER PRICE. MY DAUGHTER WAS GIVEN THE TWIN TIME DOLLHOUSE AS A BIRTHDAY PRESANT. I WAS GOING TO GET HER ALL THE FURNITURE FOR IT AND FIGURED I WOULD HAVE NO PROBLEM. I LOOKED EVERY POSSIBLE PLACE IT COULD BE GETTING MORE AND MORE FRUSTRATED. FINALLY I CALLED THE FISHER PRICE COMPANY AND THE WOMAN I TALKED TO COULND'T EVEN REALLY GIVE ME AN ANSWER. SHE JUST SAID ""NO YOU CAN'T BUY IT ANYWHERE BUT I AM NOT REALLY SURE WHY. EITHER THEY ARE DICONTINUING IT OR COMING OUT WITH DIFFERENT STUFF."" I THINK THEY ARE DISCONTINUING IT BECAUSE THEY JUST CAME OUT WITH IT. GOOD NEWS IS THAT I FINALLY FOUND ONE TOYS R US NEAR ME THAT HAD MOST OF THE FURNITURE AND SOME PEOPLE. BUT I REALLY WANTED THE SUV BECAUSE I KNOW MY DAUGHTER WOULD LOVE IT. I AM JUST SO DISAPPOINTED AND ANGRY WITH THE FISHER PRICE COMPANY TO THE POINT THAT I WILL THINK TWICE ABOUT BUYING ANOTHER PRODUCT."
5,A must for mechanical engineers,"Studying thermodynamics is, mainly because of the second law, not an easy task so having a good reference text is obligatory. I believe the author succeeded in translating his experience on the subject in a magnificent way by giving many realistic examples. It is also nice to have worked out examples in Metric units so the reader gets familiar with the order of magnitude of the results in both systems. For mechanical engineers, it is a must. For others interested in the field of thermodynamics, it is good reference although the emphasis clearly lies on the thermodynamical aspects in mechanical engineering."
3,"Lots of Examples, No HW Solutions",I am usisng this book for a course in thermo at NJIT. The book is full of examples. There are two major drawbacks. Firts is the fact that it is overpriced. There is no reason a book published over 10 years ago should cost over $100. The second drawback is that this book does not give answers to selected homework problems.
1,Not full songs / Canciones no son completas,"I bought this in Mp3 format (the CD format is the same) and upon listening found out this is only a mix and not the full length songs. Very disappointing.____________Cuando compre este disco y lo fui a escuchar, me di de cuenta que este disco era una mescla y no las canciones completes, Estoy muy desilusionado."
4,What went wrong?,This book is full of beautiful photos to remind those who are old enough how nice Jersey City used to be. I guess we can all thank genius Frank Hague for preserving the atmosphere and history of Jersey City...
2,Jersey City Mc Nulty collection,"Not really a good or complete pictorial review of Jersey City, price way to high , poor value. Can i sell it back and choose what was going to be my other choice. Other 2 books purchased at that time were very good{ Frank Hague, Mysteries of My father ]"
2,Holy streaking Batman!,"Unfortunately, my experience with this tanning lotion hasn't been as positive as most reviewers. This stuff streaked like nobody's business, and it left horrible patches on ""bendy"" areas like my neck, the outside of my armpits, and inside my elbows and knees that made me look like a leper. I was thoroughly disappointed in this lotion and won't use it again. I hate wasting products I spent good money on, so it pains me to throw this stuff in the trash, but I just don't have a choice."
3,"Provides a believable tan, but doesn't moisturize very well.","For a ""lotion"" this is lacking. I would put this on at night after I showered and shaved my legs, and my legs would feel dry again in the morning.However, the scent is superior to any other self-tanning product I've used, and I felt like it provided a nice, gradual tan that looked real! If you buy this strictly for the self-tanning properties, I'd so go for it, but as a ""moisturizer"" it wasn't great."
3,Sorry but the smell ruins this product,"Several years ago I decided to spend less time in the sun (getting older and want to avoid the whole skin cancer thing). But, pale legs and old age don't always go hand-in-hand so I bought a tube of Jergens leg tanner, which I liked. This year, my sister suggested I try L'Oreal instead, so I did. But, after three months, and one used tube of L'Oreal, I am back to Jergens.First, in its defense, the L'Oreal does a nice job of browning your legs. By the second day I already noticed browner legs. And, the lotion goes on easily and doesn't leave any streaks.BUT, the L'Oreal felt a bit ""greasier"" than the Jergens and, the biggest tie breaker for me...the smell There is a strong smell with this L'Oreal product that lingers all day. This smell was tolerable if I just browned my legs, but if I applied the lotion to my arms, I started sneezing and my nose felt irritated. So, back to Jergens."
5,Shun the Sun,"I bought this product due to the reviews and they were correct. I am 52 have fair, freckly skin that can look ghostly (ghastly) if not getting any sun, but my dermatologist said no more tanning for me. Not only does this product leave me with a gentle change in color, it absorbs quickly, has a little bit of shine that is not greasey AND makes my over-exposed wrinkly skin look less so. There is a very faint odor that is not noticeable unless in close quarters, much less than any ""self-tanner"" I have used, which can be unbearable. The only down side is the distributor who sent the product sent a bunch of 2 oz bottles! What a waste of plastic. Love the product, will buy more when all my little bottles run out : )"
4,Great color,"I like this self tanner in that it give me a nice color without looking orange. I like the gradual tanners like this as I am fairly pale and also pretty crappy with applying self tanner. With these type of gradual tanners I am much less likely to mess up. I think the color is great but as with most self tanners, I hate the smell."
3,It did the job,"I liked it but didn't love it, used up the product but wouldn't repurchase. It the job done but not as nice as I would have liked."
4,Good color,"It's a pretty good body moisturizer and tone enhancer, it provides a good skin tone when I mix this with the fair skin one.For very fair skin I suggest you mix the medium with the fair (equal amounts)."
5,One of the best self tanners,I've purchased quite a few self tanning lotions and this is by far my favorite. I ran out and had to buy a different L'Oreal self tanner and it was terrible! I'm embarrased to go in public. So glad I found it on Amazon!
4,effective but kind of smelly,"I was slightly hesitant to buy this product because of other reviews mentioning that that this product leaves your skin smelling like fake tanner, but this seemed like the self-tanning lotion with the best reviews and I didn't want to be pasty white this winter, so I decided to go for it. Sadly, the other reviewers who say that it kind of smells were right- its got that very distinctive self tan smell but it isn't out of control strong (although for sure is noticeable) and it definitely gives your skin a nice tan color, not too splotchy or orange. If you look really hard you can see the sparkly thing other reviewers talk about, but I can't even tell unless I'm in really bright light and looking at my skin super close up. I would (and will) buy another bottle of this stuff."
2,I'm covered in sparkles,"Okay, I'm a novice at sunless tanning lotions, so I think that the streaks are probably my fault because I didn't do a fantastic job of rubbing it in evenly... But that doesn't change the fact that I'm now at work and my body is covered in shimmery specks."
1,Glittery!!!,"I'm a male who wanted a good base color for a beach trip so I decided to try this product. Given the glowing reviews and mild description I figured it would be a nice, subtle change of skin tone. After applying yesterday I noticed on my commute to work that I'm glittery as hell. Luckily I didn't apply this to my face, but I'm forced to wear long sleeves for a while...So unless you want to look like your from a Twilight movie I suggest you go with another 'natural looking' tanning product."
3,Not Bad for the Money,"This ladder is okay for the money. It's the first one we have ever bought and if I would have known, I would have bought one with a platform. It is kind of hard to get into the boat, but with a little help, I can make it. The kids have no problem. But if you are approaching middle age and are not in that good of shape, consider something with a platform."
1,Buyer Beware,"I rarely review items. I must note my disappointment, however, with customer service for this item. While the description clearly states for the Performer Grill, this grate did not fit it. The Seller insisted on a restocking fee of 1/3 of the cost of the item. When pointed out to the seller, the seller responded that there was more than one size grate for the Performer Grill. This was checked via Weber product description and confirmed to be inaccurate during the customer service call. The inaccuracy of the product description notwithstanding, the seller refused to accept the return without the restocking fee. I cannot recommend the seller, when other merchants would have treated the customer with more respect."
4,for those about to rawk,"Big guitar riffs, pounding piano, super catchy tunes. By the Grace of God makes me happy...an inspiration to dig into the closet and pull out my old leather jacket and air guitar in the living room with the stereo up to 11. For those who dig the big sounds of super charged 70's arena rawk (with some Big Star thrown into the mix and nasty Motor City 5 kicking your jams all over the place)or the likes of Nebula, Kyuss. The Hellacopters Rawk."
3,"Good, But Tame & Commercial Compared To Previous Works...","This is a must have cd for any fan of the band. For the uninitiated, however, ""By The Grace"" is not the best place to start if you want to experience the harder rocking, MC5 inspired sound, which put the band on the map. ""Grace"" contains more melodies, has better ""production"" and a tighter sound than previous albums, but personally that means commerical success (not quite a sell-out at this point). The twin guitar attack is mellowed in the mix in favor of song structure and overall restraint. At times the band comes off sounding more like the Romantics than MC5. But again, that's my personal opinion. I'm a metal head by trade and tend to view the albums from that perspective.So if you like your ""hard rock"" a bit on the mellower side (even though that might be a contradiction in terms), this album might be for you. But if the intro to ""Kick Out The Jams"" is what moves you, opt for previous albums ""Payin' The Dues"" or ""Grande Rock""."
3,Hellacopters - 'By The Grace Of God' (LIquor & Poker),"Maybe it's just me, but 'By The Grace Of God' appears to be a bit less heavy than the other CD's I've heard by the Hellacopters - but don't get me wrong - understand it's still good and all. Maybe this effort is just what some patrons (like myself) may consider to be radio friendly. Tunes like ""Down On The Free Street"", ""It's Good But It Ain't Right"" and ""On Time"" simply didn't manage to knock me out of my chair like some of the band's other releases. However, I thought the almost-mainstream ""U.Y.F.S."" definitely had the potential to 'catch on' with the proper airplay. Too bad they disbanded last year. I say, give them time - reunions are huge these days."
3,This album is plain.,"I am a new Hellacopters fan. I have been purchasing their albums one at a time. This one is my third.Being an MC5, The Stooges, and Black Sabbath fan (these are the bands other reviewers compare The Hellacopters to), I have found that in Payin the Dues, and some tracks on Cream of the Crap 1. This album, By the Grace f God, is like 80's pop. My girlfriend who likes Bon Jovi, likes this album. It is overproduced and to clean.I can appreciate their efforts, but it is not for me, an MC5 & Stooges fan."
4,Great for kids that like the music but not the vulgar.,This CD is a great CD. I personally have both versions and I loan out my edited one to my little brother. So it's great for kids that aren't ready for the harsh language.
4,Where U At Rock!,"This is pretty dang good! The editing is very, ""radio friendly."" I've heard the original, and the edited is better! They even edit out a$$! The only thing they don't edit out is ""damn"", and ""Hell"". GO BUY RIGHT NOW!"
4,Great change of pace in music world,This album talking about Kid Rock's trials and tribulations of growing up in Detroit are great. He brings a different view to this kind of music. Also very good in concert
5,Kid Rock id da BOMB!,"Kid Rock is da BOMB! If u haven't listened to his Cd then u should! And if u like Kid Rock then you're bound to like Eminem, KoRn, Limp Bizkit, etc. Peace out."
4,"Good for a ""clean"" version","I have heard both the unedited and edited versions of this CD, and the unedited version is much better. For example, there are two more songs, and track #7 is much improved. The editing on this CD at least keeps the issue interesting, although in some instances you can still hear the word... Anyway, Kid Rock is a truly talented performer. In ""Only God Knows Why"", he imitates an 80's metal ballad while sounding like Cher (thanks to the use of vocoders). In ""Welcome 2 The Party"" (especially the unedited version), he truly captures the spirit of a party. And the list goes on... Rock also is a capable lyricist, although some of his metaphors are rather forgetabble. One shocking fact: The only song without a single edited word is track #9, ""Somebody's Gotta Feel This"" (although ""Bawitdaba"" and ""I Got One For Ya"" come close. Moral: the unedited version is NOT for children."
2,Bah....just another loser with a record deal,"Kid Rock talks about nothing but himself and his so called ""Cool"" life and his ""Ladies"". If the songs aren't about himself, they don't make any sense at all. What makes me even more puzzled is why anyone would buy an edited CD. The sounds are awful, and this CD has a total sissy edit. Devil Without A Cause sounds much better unedited. EDITED CDS SUCK. BUY THE EXPLICIT VERSION. And even then, you might not be satisfied with this CD."
5,1 Great Song,"I used to hate Kid Rock and after listening to Only God Knows Why i actually liked the song. The only song hes not screaming, rapping. IT proves that unlike some bands Kid Rock actually has a voice."
4,Awesome,I only gave it 4 stars because it cut out 2 songs witch wasnt a smart move on Kid Rock fans behalf. But it was awesome the rest of it my favorite songs are DWAC and I'm the bullgod.
5,this is the best cd,this cd is the best cd ever made. If you buy this cd i guarantee that you will like it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,The Kid ain't nothin' but a fake!,"The fact that an performer this terrible would be allowed airplay on MTV and radio in this day and age is scary. Didn't we learn a lesson from Vanilla Ice, MC Hammer and Milli Vanilli??....Where will Kid Rock be three years from now? I don't know, but his career will be over. Horrible. Don't buy it!!"
5,"Awesome, just plain awesome","This cd is without question the greatest cd ever recordedBawitdaba: Are you kidding me? Nominated for a grammy in 2000 AMAZING SONG! 20/20Cowboy: SwEeT 19/20Devil Without A Cause: One of the best Kid Rock song ever made. sweet awesome amazing enough said 20/20I Am The Bullgod: amazingly awesome 20/20Roving Gangsta: Sorta ok, but still pretty good 15/20Wasting Time: FUNNY, GOOD, AWESOME! 20/20Welcome 2 The Party: really good 18/20I Got One For Ya: When you buy this cd, just skip this song 2/20Somebody's Gotta Feel This: Gotta love the football song 20/20Fist of Rage: Not much to say... 16/20Only God Knows Why: THE BEST KID ROCK SONG HANDS DOWN 1,00000/20Where U At Rock: Good, but the I AM THE BULLGOD mix at the end was unnessary 19/20I Give this cd 20/20"
4,Devil Without A Cause,Devil Without A Cause is a great CD. Most of the song that started Kid Rock's career like Bawitdaba and Devil Without A Cause are on it. This is a good CD and I think you should buy it.
2,POOR CD,This cd was pretty bad. The only 2 good songs were Bawitaba and Cowboy. The rest is just blur. I wish I hadn't have bought the cd. I should have just taped it off of TRL or something. Not a bad idea.
1,Kid who?,"Why is he so popular? I haven't listened to this disc, but than again, why would I want to? If you want a good CD, try The Slim Shady LP (edited)."
2,There's better out there,"This is not a great CD. When I first heard Bawitaba, I started listening, and the intro was really cool, but then he started rapping. Kid Rock is a poser, and there is much better stuff out there"
5,makes Harry look like a Boy Scout!,"Not that there's anything wrong with Harry. But Lyra, rather than being portrayed as a slightly inept side-kick, is THE HEROINE. Her adventures through the Dark Materials have many levels, in which both adult and older child will find many meanings both metaphorical and physical. I couldn't put this down until I'd read all 3 books in the series. I'm leaving for vacation with all three again after being away for 3 years -- I want to do it all again! I hope you enjoy this wonderful trilogy."
5,The Best Book I have ever Read!!!!,"Wow!! I am usually not a suspense reader. Our book club selected this book as a monthly selection,therefore I ""had"" to read it. I am so glad that I did.Once I picked up this book it was very difficult to put it down. The main two chracters Hennessey and Tristian were great together. The book was well written. It will keep you guessing up until the end. I thought the title was perfect. The definition given in the book for serpent was great; "" someone close to you that is intentionally trying to hurt you."" I am patiently waiting for J.D. Daniels next book to come out. I hope its a sequel. I would love to find out what happens to Hennessey and T.J."
3,Okay Read,"I decided after reading and loving Shades of a Chameleon, I would go back and read Serpent in My Corner. Needless to say I was a bit disappointed. I thought the book didn't pick up until chapter 20 and what kind of FBI Agent was Hennessy? I'll tell you a bad one. Also what is the deal with everybody winking there eye; I noticed the same thing in her other book. All in all I didn't care for this book and wished I had went to the library to pick this one up."
5,A creative masterpiece!,"It is hard to write in a few words how truly excellent this book is. If you are drawn to the Harry Potter books, then you should definitely give this one a chance. Instead of focusing on the dark side of the supernatural, Henn focuses on the good & moral side. ""Nick & Slim"" is a safe book for kids, youth, and adults! The reader attention's is captured by the timeless battle of good verses evil in the first few pages and you won't be able to put the book down until you are done. Enjoy!!!"
5,Nick and Slim The Legend of the Falcon Mine,"I read Nick and Slim aloud to my two boys, ages 8 & 9. We all loved it! Every time I would come to the end of a chapter, my boys would beg me to continue reading. We found the characters very engaging and the story line held mystery till the end. This was one of those books that we hated to finish because we felt like we were leaving good friends. We look forward to a sequel."
5,Award Winner - Fiction Young Adult Category USA 2006 - Congratulations!,"Nick and Slim is a USA 2006 Book Awards Winner for Best Book in the categoy of Fiction for Young Adults and a Finalist for the Childrens Category. What an incredible book. . .""Harry Potter"" fans. . .must read this book! You can't put it down. It's a chance to learn about the era, the geography, and have fun while learning. Folks of all ages from children all the way up to seniors will love this endearing book. I am over the age of 50 and loved it. And, the illustrations are excellent as well! What a great gift this will make for family members and friends! I can't wait for the sequel to come out! I would give this 10 stars if it were possible!"
5,Inside the Tuscan Hills,"Very well presented and very educational as well as entaining! Camille has an excellent and comfortable presentation style and you almost feel that you are there with her. I wish she would make other travel shows. As far as I can determine, this is the only series of its kind."
3,No Siena?,"The video has great info about the little Tuscan cities but unfortunately they did not include the city of Siena..which was pretty disappointing. Also, PBS could have picked a better host. Overall good video and if you've ever been to the Tuscany region, this will take you back to those wonderful memories. Enjoy!"
2,Incomplete product,"This was advertised as being all 6 episodes from the PBS series, but only included the first 3 on 1 DVD. I returned it, getting a replacement (very promptly, BTW). Same problem. Probably a manufacturing issue."
5,Inside info,"I have really enjoyed the DVD. I have been to many of the areas over the past 4-5 years and they are still showing me areas that I would love to visit when I return this fall. Almost like having a personal guide, who is cute and entertaining.Great price for this type of video, I think.Bruce Schratz, L.R., AR"
4,Very good book,"Koenig's book has the rare quality of being both readable and scientific. He presents credible data showing how religion benefits people's mental and physical health. This approach is quite unlike the anti-scientific rant of anti-religious treatises like Wendell Watters' book Deadly Doctrine, which relies mainly on anecdotal evidence, personal bias, and theoretical speculation. Instead, Koenig uses controlled studies to prove his points. I'd give him a few extra brownie points for managing to show a Christian attitude to people like Watters, whom I find maddening."
5,Extremely satisfied,"This coin purse was purchased as a Christmas gift for my husband. He is very satisfied with it. He has had other coin purses of this style, but none were of the quality of this one. It is well made of nice leather."
3,Tacco coin purse,"The ordering, delivery, etc. was excellent. It is a nice quality, well constructed item. I had thought the lid or flap of the coin purse would have more of lip; forming a tray for coin display.Not this model therefore not exactly what I was anticipating. This was my mistake and certainly the product was as described by the seller."
5,Guilty Pleasure,"Plain and simple, this is a lot of money to pay for something to hold my quarters. But it is a very well made item, one that should last a long time and look great."
5,Great product ! Great value !,My Coin Purse arrived within a week and I was delighted with the product. It is very well made and the leather is soft and has an already broke in feel. It holds a surprising amount of coins and is the perfect size for a trouser pocket. I may but a few more for Christmas gifts.
3,A brief summary of BMW.,"An interesting book with nice photographs and printed on good quality paper.Bit light on for detail.If you like plenty of colour photos and something to read then this book is okay.I recommend this book:""BMW 1975-2001:model by model"" By Laurence Meredith."
2,Poor,"... Mostly unenganging, poor on historical details, and basically your boring coffe table book about BMW. I got the feeling while reading this book that this must be your standard issue info book at BMW's musseum in Munich. (I got as close as the Olympiad Colisseum so I cannot testify to that personally.)On the plus side, you get a list of BMW's internal model codes. That you'll need in anyway in order to follow the book's poorly written structure."
5,Yummy low calorie snack,"I thought these were very yummy! Chex cereal with a slight sweetness and the flavor of strawberry, and for eight boxes, each with six packets inside, it is a better deal that you would get buying them at the grocery store. The packets are not huge, but they are 100 calories, just enough for a snack or to take the edge off your hunger. I'm going to have to get some more."
2,Empty Box?,"I HAVEN'T TRIED THIS. There, that's out of the way!Read that description carefully, folks! ""4.2 oz box, and there's 6 bags in a box."" That's a little over 2/3 oz. per bag! I would need, like, a box and a half before I even knew I had eaten!If you're trying to lose weight, there's gotta be a better way than this. I think the only weight I would lose with these things would be from my wallet!"
1,If you have Nikon S9 Digital Camera...,Dont get it if you have one. It doesn't work for S9 series.I had to contact the seller and It is in a process to be refund which will take another three weeks or so.
4,India Treasures is an engaging novel,"India Treasures is as entertaining as it is intriguing, shifting you back and forth from present day to a variety of historical periods, weaving a story full of history, mystery, intrigue and atmosphere. I highly recommend this book. Whether you're an Indophile or a mystery-lover, you'll find yourself pulled into each story-within-a-story and a little sorry to look up and find out that you're really sitting on your own couch."
4,It works...,"I started using this product and within a week I felt my nails healthier and longer. I am also taking biotin supplements, so I believe the combination of both products are helping my nails grow, The delivery of this product was fast."
5,Lenmar Cell Phone Battery for LG VX5200,"Bought this for a friend's mother's phone, brought new life into a phone that we're reluctant to change (if ain't broke, and it's comfortable and familiar, it's a good thing for some people). Battery seems to hold a charge well."
4,It works.,"Hold charges just fine and lasts about 2-3 days in my VX8300. At this price I feel like I should have bought two, one for emergency one for regular use."
3,Best of the Series,"This, the fifth in the Manor House series of mysteries, is the best thus far. In this entry, the murder of one of Elizabeth's tenants is not the main focus. More time is spent on the dramas going on in her life as well as the lives of the other inhabitants of fictional Sitting Marsh. I enjoyed this book for that very reason - Kate Kingsbury tends to write better serial fiction than actual mysteries. Usually the mystery parts of her books are quite easy to figure out and I prefer reading about the progress in the various relationships. All in all, this is a quick and light read that makes for a pleasant Sunday afternoon."
1,I'm a teacher and I do not recommend!,"I am an orchestra teacher and I HATE when my parents go on ebay, or craiglist, or here, to purchase an instrument. ATTENTION PARENTS: You will NOT find a quality violin or viola for under $150, preferably 200! Stop trying to save a buck and get your child something they will be successful on!"
4,Great Customer Service at Austin Bazaar!,When I first tried to tune the violin I applied pressure to the D peg and the scroll broke from the fingerboard! It wasn't a lot of pressure so I assume there was a crack or a weak spot in the wood. Needless to say I contacted (emailed) customer support and was pleasantly surprised when they agreed to replace the violin at no charge (not even shipping)! The new violin arrived and I was able to tune it fine. My five year old son has been performing around the house almost everyday!Now a word about the quality. Would I buy this brand to perform professionally? No. This is an inexpensive introduction to the violin - it is a massed produced product that I think is wonderful at this price. Beautiful to look at and my son loves it - nuff said.
1,Piece of Junk that will break,"I purchased this for my daughter. She has taken great care of the instrument. We had the instrument for a month when as her violin instructor was tuning the instrument the back of the violin came apart. Austin Bazaar would not refund or exchange the item. I would not order anything from them again. It is cheap, there is a reason for that."
1,Nice wall-hanging,"As a string instructor, I have unfortunately seen instruments like these at school. It would be better for parents to check into school-rental instruments or other inexpensive sources than to buy low quality instruments. Look for instruments adjusted to MENC specifications. It might seem like a cheap instrument is better than no instrument, but the students I have observed with these either get a better instrument soon or quit out of frustration. Either way, it's money down the drain."
1,piece of junk,"This violin never worked right. It needed to be put together, and we never were able to get any decent sound out of it, even rosining the bow with what we were sent. It's basically just a dust collector."
3,Could have been better..,"It looks very pretty and elegant from far, but up close it looks a lil cheap the diamonds are really small and not even on all the rows jus on 4 of the 7 rows. The silver polish is what is mostly making it sparkle...It is also a tad expensive for a brooch.."
5,MGM AND WARNER GET WITH IT !!!!,Most people dont have VHS anymore! We cant watch this movie on out Plasma tvs. Please re-master it on DVD so we too can enjoy it !!!
2,An oversize let down,"This movie is a sad piece of cinema. I found it difficult to watch. The only reason I gave it two stars is the cast, but they can't save this film. The storyline is so then. They also seem to be taking bits from other musicals that were popular and meshing them all in to one. Also, Mickey Rooney is playing a 17 year old lovestruck high school graduate again! This entire film is unbelievable. There isn't a single song that catches the ear. Oh well, I guess this is one musical MGM got wrong."
2,falls short of original 20Q,"I agree with the other review. The original 20Q is amazing. The fun of playing it is picking hard obscure objects and it actually getting it right. I got this for my daughter and I choose Johnny Depp, thinking he has to be one of the hottest celebs around now, it's first guess was Mel Gibson, and second guess was James Spader. I think for kids wanting it to guess their fav stars, it is too hard to distinguish among them and they will be disappointed. Stick to the original game."
4,Fun for all ages,I recently bought this for my girlfriend and her father. They both loved their 20q game and could not put them down. I highly reccomend this for anyone who is a fan of puzzle games.
2,This needs to be rinsed off,"It doesn't say in the product description, but this product needs to be washed off with soapy water and then rinsed. I bought it to polish brass on a large trunk and this just doesn't work for me or the trunk. Very disappointed."
1,Product Malfunction,I ordered this set and it arrived - all the way to Tokyo - today. It is completely missing Disc 1. I now have to ship back Disc 2 so that I can have a replacement set. (How stupid is that?) Be careful ordering this - especially if you live outside the US>
4,What a great show!,"This is another terrific season of clever cons, surprise endings, and lots of laughs. There is one clinker in the bunch that strains credulity more than usual (a mark develops amnesia), but this season also features one of the best episodes of the series so far--Mickey (Adrian Lester) and Danny (Marc Warren) square off in a challenge of grifting skills: both are abandoned naked in the middle of town at noon to see who can accumulate the most by the end of the day. I've read that Lester left the show before season 4, so it'll be interesting to see what has become of the show when that season is released."
4,"Weber 10020 Smokey Joe Silver Charcoal Grill, Black","This is a good little BBQ with one big flaw, it doesn't have any handles like almost all the other brands, which makes it quite difficult to clean the grill while it's hot, which is how I prefer to clean it. What were you thinking, Weber?"
5,The best deal in grilling....hands down.,"The Smokey Joe is the greatest. Easy to use, easy to maintain temperature. This one is a lot better than the 40020 model. That one has the bottom vent on the side as opposed to the bottom and cooks VERY unevenly according to my brother who has that one. You can cook for 4 people on this grill. Ever since I got this, the 22"" kettle hardly ever gets used. The 22 is now used for beer can chicken and company and that's it! ! ! I find it important to rotate the lid while cooking, which allows the air to blow across all the coals and keeps them burning evenly."
3,flowing issues,"First of all, this is probably the best quality portable grill I've had. It has the Weber quality to last years and years. I've only had this for a year and I don't want to throw it out yet.When I use the Smokey Joe at home, I expect the same grilling experience of a larger grill by being able to control heat with the vents. Even though there are vents on the top and bottom of the grill, there just isn't enough air flow. Food always cooks slower for me and I need to add more charcoal so that the heat is closer to the food.There are two models of the Smokey Joe, and I think the other one doesn't even have a hole on the bottom..."
4,cute little grill!,"I ordered this item because I live in a small apartment and have no room for a regular-sized grill, but enjoy cooking out on occasion. This grill is perfect for my application. It was inexpensive, fits easily in my outside storage closet, is small and easy to clean, but big enough to cook for a small get-together. The only down side I have found is that I wish there was some way of securing the lid onto the grill for storage or transport. Overall a good product."
5,Great little BBQ,"This grill is perfect for someone who doesn't want a big huge grill but still wants to be able to have cookouts occasionally. I have been able to have several parties with it and cook for over 10 people without a major problem. Sadly i lost the bottom charcoal holder grill plate so i'm a little screwed, but for the value, i'm very happy with the way the grill heats, cooks, and holds the heat."
4,nice little BBQ,Used it 2-3 times and works well. Takes some time to get used to though. Also you have to clean it up good if you want to use it for a longer time.
4,a little smaller than I thought,"I was really hoping for a larger grill but I should have read the measurements! After reading the directions, you have to put a foil drip pan in the bottom and surround this with your coals...then if you are cooking something that needs a longer cooking time, you have to keep adding coals..I don't get how you would do this if you have a grill full of HOT food..seems a little inconvenient to me. It will be okay for a few burgers and dogs but I think I'll invest in a larger grill next time."
5,Smoky Joe Silver is awesome for home use too.,"Just fired this little guy up for the first time today and WOW! It cooked fast and even really awesome job. And with the hickory chips I added it evenly smoked my sirloin burgers to perfection! Must be the small dome shape that just works wonders. To break it in I used frozen sirloin hamburgers from Sam's Club. You can actually fit five of those large burgers on this tiny grill perfectly. When done I justed closed the vents top and bottom and it put out the coals for use later. My large stainless propane grill is now retired. If I'm entertaining I'd much rather have two or three of these little Smokey Joe grills than one large propane grill, no kidding. And three Smokey Joe Silver grills cost far less than that monster did. Oh and btw I'm sure it would be a great camping grill too.Can't beat this little grill I highly recommend it.btw, yes I'm a weber but no relation to the grill company that I know of."
3,it's okay,"not sure whether it is charcoal or the unit itself. After using it one time, and clean it, there seems to be rusted, especially at the grill part.However, for the price, I dont want to complain more. Nice tools for BBQ for small group."
4,Long lasting,Hi had my first Smokey Joe for over 20 years. The outside shell lasts a long time and I only had to replace the grills inside. I wish these came with stainless screws for assembly.
5,Love my Smokey Joe,"A lot of magical summer evenings have been created with my Smokey Joe. Yes, some very tasty meals have come off that grill. An excellent choice for the single person. Weber did not skimp on the quality when making their smallest grill. It is built to last."
5,Smokey Joe charcoal grill,"Weber 10020 Smokey Joe Silver Charcoal Grill, BlackJust recently purchased a Smokey Joe Silver charcoal grill. Wanted something small and convenient, and this grill fits my needs. Used it and love the ease of using a small grill. Easy to handle and clean, and the steaks were delicious.Molly"
5,Weber Smokey Joe grill is great!,We love this grill. It is compact and cooks foods even and great. We received it from the seller as promised and are very happy with this purchase.
5,A Good Inexpensive Product that Produces Great Results,"I have only used this a few times. But the results were excellent. I cooked chicken legs using the sear then indirect heat method (sear a few minutes over the coals then shift legs to other side of grill -- the charcoal is only placed on one side of the grill). I added a few mesquite wood chips, soaked for 15 mins and placed in foil, next to the coals. The results were excellent with a great mesquite smoked taste. I was amazed how juicy the chicken was -- and I never turned it once. I only sprayed a little olive oil and added salt, garlic powder, and pepper. Served with BBQ sauce on the side.After cooking, the remaining charcoal snuffed out very quickly and was ready and usable for the next BBQ.You won't go wrong with this grill and I see no problem with cooking for a small family with it."
5,Silver Doesn't Mean Second,"The Smokey Joy Silver does everything you'd expect with minimal bells, buzzers or whistles. Easy to assemble, easy to use, easy to maintain & store, and relatively rugged, it just chugs along grilling food with minimal drama (save the occasional flare-up). The main difference between the silver and gold seems to be the gold has a ""bucket"" handle that flips up over the top of the lid handle, allowing you to lug it to the beach or park. We keep ours on the deck, so I don't care about lugging. And the free shipping made it a no-brainer. It's an American classic. Love it."
2,Buy the gold or platinum,"I grill year round and in many weather conditions. Unlike the gold and platinum grills, the silver grill does not have a carry handle to keep it shut for transport (see the review about the burnt down car), nor does it have the ability to prop the lid as a wind/rain shield. The silver grill works fine in nice weather for fast, hot cooking, but if you want to grill in a drizzle or in a little wind, the ability to prop the lid up (available on the gold and platinum models) is essential. I lost my gold grill. Last night I tried cooking in a little rain on the silver grill, and it wasn't up to task like my gold grill was. I'm going to buy a gold or platinum grill this time."
5,I'm in love with this grill!,"I got this to put into my camper. works just like it big brother. when I am camping I just use the match lite charcoal( I know it's cheating, but with 2 starving kids..). It is easy to clean up, and store. weekend campers this is a must."
5,Just the right size.,"Smokey Joe charcoal grill. A personal opinion. Think food grilled over a charcoal fire tastes better than when cooked over a gas grill. And Smokey Joe is just the right size for grilling for two people. Good for a couple of steaks, pack of hot dogs, two chicken halves, package of chicken wings, or salmon filets. As your food is pretty close to the fire, let the coals burn down to an ash covered state before you start grilling. Have found about 25 briquettes burned to this level work good for me. The only con is this grill is a bit too small for indirect grilling. Other than that, it works for me. Did I mention this grill is a replacement for a ten year old smokey joe that was left somewhere in a move?"
4,Love this little guy!,"I love my Smokey Joe! It is the perfect size for me. I usually just cook about 6 hot dogs and a few hamburgers at a time but I could probably fit a little more. It seems to be pretty sturdy - I leave it outside all the time. It was simple to put together and looks just like the picture. For the price, you really can't ask for more!"
3,Smokes ok,"I'll give this about a C. It is incredibly smoky, and takes all day just to cook a few ounces of meat. I boil the ribs first to get some of the cooking out of the way, and this little Smokey still takes his time doing his job. The ribs were ok, but better order pizza while you wait because it'll be next evening before your food is ready."
2,Ain't worth the price,"If you want to cook 4 burgers you should be ok. If you want to cook 4 burgers and some veggies or potatoes, it won't work.Here's why. 1st, the cooking surface is very small. 2nd, if you put to enough coals in there to cook for an extended period of time, it gets to hot. If you only put in as the instructions say, it's not enough heat or after your burgers cook, the coals won't stay hot. It could be that there isn't enough ventilation to keep the fire going.Regardless, it's not enough grill for me. For cooking hot dogs or roasting marshmallows, your good. For steaks, fagetabotit!Bottom line is that this small grill is not for beginners. And if you're going to use it, make sure to follow the instructions, then add 20% more coals on top."
1,Bad Product,"The vent at the bottom gets filled with ashes quickly and then there is no ventilation from the bottom, you put the lid on, the coals go out. Not a good design.I used it twice and now it is sitting in the garage. I am using my rusted to hell old BBQ that came with the ash can at the bottom though the ash can is now gone , I have been unable to find a better product.Here in Canada I paid $80 for this Weber Smokey Joe Silver BBQ and I sure feel ripped off."
2,missing parts,"When I opened my gift I was on my way to tailgate. Disappointed missing washers,bottom grate missing,and the vent on the top was broken.I love webber grills have had many over the years. Not sure what happened here but open your box as soon as you get it. I waited a long time"
3,Gets the job done... usually,"This is just the right size for our 6mos old son. I originally got this bowl and spoon set for our son to take to daycare. I thought it would be great because everything is all together and won't get lost. However, on his first day when I took this bowl out of the bag to put into the fridge his daycare worker exclaimed ""Oh I hate those!"" when she saw the bowl.The main problem with the bowl is that the lid is hard to get on and off. It also leaks if it happens to fall on its side. The spoon is great though. It's soft and it changes color if the food is to warm.We'll keep on using it for the time being, however I'm looking for a new one."
3,"Okay, but not great.","I had this bowl for about 3 months now and I've only used it a few times. The idea behind it is great- 2 sections, lid, and a nice little design to help you hold on to it. One problem, I'm left handed. I hold the bowl in my right hand and feed my son w/ the left. Using that hand, it's not possible to comfortably hold the bowl w/ it's special handle. It is sturdy, and it cleans up nicely. If it weren't for the un-friendliness towards lefties, I would probably give it a higher star rating."
2,Great bowl... but the lid is IMPOSSIBLE to get off,I love this bowl for first feedings... just enough room and the spoon is great. I rated it so low because I have actually hurt myself trying to get the lid off of it. I have to use a spoon to pry the lid off and today i actually bruised my knuckle on the counter.
2,Engineering causes great disservice........,"Please note this recording was played in my home on stereo---not multichannel---equipment which is of the upper audiophile range.I have nothing negative to say about the orchestral and solo instrument playing. However, at least in my system, the engineering ruins the entire recording. Specifically, the balance between orchestra and piano is completely off...with loudness of each being equal as far as my perception is concerned. Sorry, but I don't think that's the way a properly recorded instrumental concerto is supposed to work.I suggest, before spending money to buy a personal copy of the CD, an attempt be made to prevue this recording.****"
4,Good value for a small book,"This small book purpose is to cover the most important aspects of flight mechanics for advanced undergraduate students. To keep pace with this goal, the mathematical level is pretty accessible and never demanding ( just basic derivatives and almost no integral, the few ones have solutions described in the text ). The good facet is the analysis of supersonic cruise of airplanes and the perfomance of hypervelocity reentry vehicles. Since other textbooks are scanty on the matter, albeit more advanced in mathematical presentation, this volume is a good complement to a course textbook in those fields.If the reader is looking for a comprehensive text, this volume will provide many answers to his/her curiosity. If the student target is a particular suject, more specific treatise is needed. The reading will be of interest for professional pilots with a taste for theoretical insight of aircraft perfomance."
3,More great tunes... but I expected better,"It will take you a few days to get used to Racer X's new direction. It is certainly not an album that resembles their earlier works, that much is true.But, dont judge the album until you've really listened to it. The first time I put it into my CD player I was thinking ""Am I really ever going to listen to this? Should I throw this album away?"" The thought had crossed my mind, because I couldnt adjust. After listening to it for the next few days, I was convinced the album was a keeper. You have to get hooked to the album to really enjoy it. After getting it straight that this isnt a heavy metal shred-frenzy, you'll begin to listen for the music, and you'll begin to like it.Some highlights of this CD are Lucifer's Hammer, Go-GG-Go, Empty Man, Siren's Eye, Endless, and Catapault to Extinction. My favorite is Catapault, which is an instrumental with incredible chops by the man on guitar, Paul Gilbert."
4,"A great album,but don't enter at once","It's a great album for me,when i hear at fist time i said:""It's the worst Racer X album"" i hear the album one time,two times,three times...and now i think it's a great album.But isn't the best racer x album"
2,"Some good spots, but mostly disappointing.","I really loved Technical Difficulties and Superheros, but this album pales in comparison to those two. There are a few ok solos, but the guitar really lacks balls! They toned down the music, and the instrumental Catapult to Extinction is bland. The song ""Everything is Everything"" really sucks; I can't hardly stand to listen to it. A few of the songs are ok, being Lucifer's Hammer, Golden God, and Empty Man. Even though these songs are ok, the album stinks and Racer X have really put out crap this time. Buy Technical Difficulties and Superheros, but skip this one."
2,A Paul Gilbert Teaser!,"This is not Racer X! This is Paul Gilbert going off on one of his tangents and as all too often with the man this does not work!I give it two stars only because you can hear Racer X in this mess somewhere for a few seconds every song or two.For me it is crap!Put on ""Superheroes"" and then throw on ""Getting Heavier"". Worlds apart!"
1,Getting Lighter,"Racer X needs to get a grip on themselves and consider new careers.I always thought they were a great side project band but they need to draw the line. The title of their new work ""Getting Heavier"" is a misleading title for this album.It's anything but ""heavier"".Most of the songs on GH are weak.The only positive point of the album is Jeff Martins singing.The cd should have been entitled ""Getting Lighter""."
1,Disappointment,Nothing compared to Superheroes and Technical Difficulties.Must be a serious fan of their music to enjoy this CD.The production is awful.The songs are below average except for Lucifers Hammer.They are a good band though and good bands are entitled to make bad albums.
1,Simply aweful,"I hate this album, the songs are shoddy, the guitaring is boring to listen to and overall a load of crap."
4,"Incredible suspense, strong values and a book difficult to put aside",Although totally out of anyone's daily experience - at least for most of us - it's very good reading. Enjoy!
2,"Very Complex, Hard to Follow","I feel like I'm reading a book on Advanced Physics or something like that. This book is all over the place and is incredibly difficult to follow. I've read three books after trying and failing half a dozen times to follow this one. It's too bad I paid for it. I might go back and try again but I doubt it. In my opinion, books should be easy to follow, easy to understand, therefore creating an interest. I lost interest so I'm happy to give up my copy."
5,Great Mystery,"I have read most of Dee Henderson's books, and the Truth Seeker is definitely one of her best! I thought the plot was a bit predictable at times but there was enough suspense to make it impossible to set down.Lisa O'Malley is a forensic scientist who is injured at the start of the book. She isn't able to come back to her job full time for a while so her boss makes her review some murder cases that went cold. Lisa's investigation into some of the murders have ties to a case that U.S. Marshall Quinn Diamond has been following for years. They eventually notice the similarities and exchange information and clues. The rest of the book tells how they fall in love while trying to track down an elusive killer.There are a lot of smaller plots in the book like Lisa's family, and Christianity, but they are added subtley so the book is inhanced by their presence. I wholeheartedly recommend this book to absolutely anyone!"
5,The Truth Seeker,"This is the third book in the O'Malley Series and I would have to say that it is the funniest out of all seven of the books. Lisa and Quinn have to help solve a case that leads back into the past. But this is not only about work and no play. Lisa finally accepts dinner from Quinn and a relationship starts building, but not without some bumps along the way. The book also mentions what's happening with the other O'Malleys. Nothing can possibly stop this mysterious, romantic, and funny book from making its way into your heart. Read it. Dee Henderson knows whats she's writing about."
5,Good Suspense story.,"Lisa O'Malley is a forensic pathologist who has a difficult time with Jesus' resurrection. Quinn Diamond is Marcus O'Malley's partner in the U.S. Marshal's Service. He's been trying to get Lisa to go out with him. Unfortunately, pursuing Lisa is going to be almost impossible because he's already asked out her other sisters!Their paths cross when the cases they are investigating become intertwined. I love how we get to continue to follow the O'Malleys we already know and how we are able to get to know the others before we read their stories. I wish my family was as close as theirs is.The other O'Malley novels are: The Negotiator, The Guardian, The Truth Seeker, The Protector, The Healer, The Rescuer. Each is a wonderful read!"
5,Keeps you going.,I really liked this book. It contained great underlying relationships that keep you reading and gets you involved. You will fall in love with Lisa O'Malley while she takes this journey full of twists and turns. I thought this book was the best of the O'Malley series.
4,The Truth Seeker,This was an excellent book. I just didn't feel it was as suspenseful as the first two. I could not put the first two down.
1,Not good,"I thought this game was terrible. There is really no ""stopping"" the board, you just press a button and the game randomly selects a ""square"" for you (a chapter on the DVD) and that's the prize you supposedly landed on. It's really lame."
1,More like 'Pass' Your Luck,"I'd advise fans of the original show to skip this product. I have now tried to play it on three separate occasions, twice a piece. Only one player has made to the second round because of the whammies. You get your four right out of the gate."
1,your press your luck by purchasing this game!,People stay away! If you liked the show like we did. you will be very disapointed by the dvd game! very boring the questions suck! announcers is bad! when you get to spin on the big board you can not tell what you stopped on! Very annoying! save your money! that way you don't get hit with this whammy!
3,"Press Your Luck, opened it up straight from the box didnt even work!!","I got this as a gift for a great friend only to find out that when she tried to play it,it didnt work at all. She was so excited to get this and come to find out that something was wrong with it. I just hope she was able to return it with the reciept that i had left. Thanks"
2,Bad games sold by Target,I waited several months for this game to come out. I ordered it through Amazon-Target. I received it finally and tried to play it and not only did it freeze all the time but also kept skipping and the sound was bad. Maybe I got a bad game but with all the technology in video games this game should have been better. Very disapointing.
5,It's really fun.,"I do like this game especially since you can interact with your tv. It's fun, but after a while you do learn all the answers so it's not as challenging anymore. I guess it depends on how often you play. No matter what it's still fun to win spins and try not to get whammys."
3,Not great,"I read the reviews for the dvd game, and still decided to buy it to see for myself. I bought the game at a discount store for $5, so I didn;t feel like I had as much to lose with this.However, the gameplay goes VERY slow and the host Todd Newton can get very annoying at times. You can;t employ any strategy because the big board is just a wait screen until you hit the button to stop. There are 3 rounds of spinning and only an amount of questions based on the number of players you have playing.Overall, I give it a C+, being the only upside was paying just $5 for it."
2,Don't Purchase This,its not like the original press your luck and its to confusing to do when you are on the big board
3,press your luck,"if you are fan of the show, you will have a little fun with it, but it isn't what I was hoping for."
4,"Luke, I am your father...","This is a fun DVD hosted by Luke Skywalker AKA Mark Hamill that does a creditable job of reviewing the history of SF cinema from its earliest beginnings (Melies) up until the mid-1990s. Most of the high points of SF are touched upon, with lots of clips from classic films such as The War of the Worlds, The Invasion of the Body Snatches, and Star Wars. I've taken a star off my rating because like most American-made products, the producers think that Hollywood is the center of the cinematic universe, so European SF gets short shrift. This could have been a six hour miniseries and still held the attention of SF fans!"
5,A tool chest project book for tool nuts,"A really nice book of projects for tool nuts. The projects run from simple tool totes to fine furniture versions of tool chests. Of the 15 projects, I hope to find the time to build 10 or more, if I do, there's more reason to buy more tools to put in them. Each project has 3 view drawings and materials lists and plenty of construction photos. The book covers different joinery techniques and use and care of a few hand tools that can be used while you're building. I consider myself lucky if I find a book with 3 projects that I might actually make, this book comes out way ahead of most other project books that I have bought."
3,15 toolbox project articles...,"""Building the Perfect Tool Chest"" is perhaps too grand a title for this little collection of illustrated instructions to build 15 different tool boxes from wood. Maybe one or more of the 15 projects will be perfect for you, maybe not. For a broader consideration of tool storage efficiency, usability and the integration of tool storage with the rest of your shop or work environment, plus a project plans for a few tool chests, consider, ""Workstations & Tool Storage (New Best of Fine Woodworking)""."
4,Exciting view of the City,The city as a phenomenon has gone through major changes. Mr Soja displays some extraordinary visions and views of this phenomenon and invites us to an exciting journey of the urban and regional concept.Quite recommendable if you are interested in the subject and already know a bit about it.
4,dj screw,"this is a tight album from the late and great dj screw.It is very rare and out of print.I have 3UNOPENED 4 SALE,as well as tons of other rare rap cds.email if interested."
5,Stunning,"When she was younger, Madonna had a very natural beauty that was accentuated by her well-endowed figure. This book features some outstanding portraits of her in casual but very erotic poses; her healthy, hirsute body provides a welcome contrast to the skinny smoothness that seems to be the current feminine ideal. Sure, the collection probably never would have been published had Madonna not become the star she is today, but her celebrity status is precisely what makes the book so intriguing. I would definitely recommend it to Madonna fans, but it really belongs on the bookshelf of anyone who enjoys quality, tasteful nude photography."
1,shaky shaky,"These things suck. So out of true. They may be cheaper, but there is a good chance you be having them turned to get them true. Buy Raybestos and be done with them."
5,Light inside the Shadows,"I found this book to be very entertaining as well as educational. The author did a great job of recreating the setting of Carravaggio's life; the important characters and atmosphere of all the places the artist lived in his nomadic life. Also, I look at Carravaggio's paintings in a new light and am even more impressed and moved by them than previously. Carravaggio's was a tragic life. The author captures the sense of impending doom that hanged over the artist's head like an executioner's sword. The author did a great job of bringing the artist to life with what little is actually known about him, through records, accounts, and most of all his paintings. Through it all there is the sense of an awesome talent and fragile ego, that both humbles and angers all who knew him. I came away realzing that Carravaggio was a man of his times as well as an artist of all time."
4,The artist and the world he lived in,"Much of this book is devoted to the historical background, and much is devoted to analyses of the paintings. The illustrations could have been better. The reader is presented with a general view of Italy circa 1600. The author sides with those who seek to minimize or deny the painter's homosexuality. This book is useful for learning the facts of the artist's life and times. I'm not sure that the author manages to get inside the painter's head and heart."
5,Engrossing mystery entwined with a breathless love story.,"A quick read as the suspense of With Every Breath takes hold. A mystery and a love story you will want to reread. Beverly Bird develops her characters so well they seem real. She is my favorite author and I eagerly await more of her books. My favorites: Comes the Rain, Touch the Sun, Walk into the Night and especially With Every Breath."
5,one of the best Dukes of Hazzard episodes ever,"High Octane is really High Octane!!! The boys must make moonshine for a contest to win 10,000 dollars. But they must sneak past a new probation officer or they will get busted. They hide in the hills somewhere and make the moonshine. Black Tilly, Uncle Jesse's moonshine car also helps out the dukes. Once again the dukes prevail and spoil Boss hoggs plan to run the dukes into jail."
2,Not as helpful as i had hoped,"I was disappointed by this book: as an American who lived in Germany for 3 years, i was hoping to gain new insight into the German culture and worldview, but I didn't really learn anything that i hadn't already figured out from just interacting with Germans. It should be made more clear that this book is perhaps for people who don't know much about Germany yet, for them it could be helpful."
5,Very helpful,"Excellent book for parents who have a child with ADD. It reads like a textbook, which it is, but full of wonderful information and help."
3,Nice beach read,"This was a good book, but not a great suspense novel. No spoilers, but the killer (and the killer's undoing) were both clear from the minute the words showed up on the page, with dozens of chapters to go. The relationship between Sydney and Marshall seems obviously contrived, and as someone from a family of twins, all of the doubles seem rather ridiculous."
1,"Brutal (My enjoyment level, that is)","After reading the cover, I was very intrigued.First, if you are expecting this book to be scary or suspenseful, you will be greatly disappointed.The writing is so repetitive that I was relieved when I finally approached the final page. This is one those types of books that reads like a soap opera. You can skim through several pages without missing anything. The ending is so far fetched that I could only come to the conclusion that Mr. Morgan wrote this book under a very tight deadline.If you want to read a brilliantly written suspense novel, I would suggest ""Black for Remembrance"" by Carlene Thompson."
4,Good Summary Tour,I'm taking a group back to Iceland for New Year's and this is a great way to give people the feel of what they will experience. If you love fireworks this is the place at New Year's!
4,Prety good,"Been a movie sword is a very fine and well done copy, but there are some problems on weight and balance that make it impossible to use in practice"
5,Great Tools for Learning,I am a home school parent and these are great for my little ones (pre-school & 1st grade). These are used to introduce & compare which leads into more questions for further investigation about so many places. We are BIG into missions and we love talking about other countries and what it must be like to live there.
1,Bad history,"I treat this book as a historical document, published in 1937 it represents an example of the naive impression of the Russian revolution as seen by that generation of western writers, in this respect it reads today as sad and dated, in his epilogue he writes of USSR being prosperous and free. Either he was ignorant of collectisation, famines,GULAGs and shootings or more probably decides that denial is more comfortable."
2,terrible synthband,"I cant believe the UK is hyping this stuff. Home of the legendary Depeche Mode, Pet Shop Boys, Erasure and other great synthpop acts. This new synth sound is so corny and has no energy. If your looking for synthpop with a pulse, look elsewhere, or just buy old Kraftwerk records, as they were masters of this sound."
5,"complete and all inclusive, anne hooper is a sex goddess!","my lover and i had been experiencing problems in our relations when i was told by a friend about DK's ultimate sex pack... i had already seen DK books like their cooking DK Living series, and i knew them to be fantastic, but i was doubtful that this really would ... you know, help things out. boy oh boy! anne hooper is not only informative with large full color photos to help guide you, but the advice was great and my sex life has never been better. oh, hey! and don't forget that the package comes with hot oil and the video... just add rope and stir!"
3,???????????????,"If this is the ultimate sex pack then I don't want to read anything below it becasue it must really suck! Don't get me wrong this pack is informative, if your 12 years old! Basically this pack is good for anyone who hasn't had sex or for an old couple who is trying to spice up there marriage. If you are experienced at sex and know more then 2 positions this book will seem like a refresher course to the obvious.The video is very undescriptive and does not teach anything to the experienced, it's also PG13 at best. I especially liked the oral sex lesson without showing the male or female genitalia. The message oil was a nice touch except for the fact that my lover and I used it all up in one night.If anyone would like to purchase the Sex pack from me they can have it for $10 and you pay the shipping.Kevin_M11@hotmail.com"
1,Not the Originals - Do not buy!,Not the original versions. Poorly re-done with original artists and studio musicians. Do not buy!
1,"Purchased accidentally, deleted","Actually, accidentally purchased this through 1 click on my Kindle Fire. Have since turned off that setting. These songs are lame re-recordings of the originals. I despise them so much that I just ate the 6 bucks and deleted everything. Garbage. If there was a 0 rating, I'd give it that."
4,enjoyment of the old country music,enjoy hearing the old artis classcial music and old days by gone we all enjoy it here aty work and at home
5,Varity,Fun to listen to a mix of artists and when these were all popular while younger still enjoy them today.
1,UGH!,"I'd like to give it a score of ""-5"" but 1 is the lowest available here. This is absolutely and positively the ugliest artistic rendition of Oscar Wilde's beautiful fairy tales and of that of thousands of children's books I have read or collected over many years. The comic book style illustrations draw the reader away from the inner poetry and beauty of Wilde's prose. This is truly the first book I have ever thought of burning - it would make good kindling for the fireplace."
3,A good novel about family and Japanese-American heritage,"Holly Uyemoto's second novel is narrated by the protagonist Wil, a soon to be 21 year girl who is trying to come to terms with adulthood as well as her somewhat dysfunctional Japanese-American family. As a student, Wil deals with many of the same anxieties confronting today's college students: abortion, relationships, therapy. As a Japanese-American, Wil confronts the legacy that the internment experience wrought on her family. I think this book would make a good tool in an undergraduate course which seeks to relate information about family conflicts and Asian-American experiences. It is short and speaks to the sort of problems that students can relate to."
1,utterly waste of good tree,"Though I must give credit to author for she does have perspective from her culture, I find this book unnecessary and a completely waste of time. Some woman who is about the 21, can not get over her past, is immature about herself and her words, is has a large ego for herself, who apprently is trying to find purpose in her family in life. Her disastrous relationship with her family and other aquaintances leads to one bad ending. Much respect goes to her grandfather and grandma at the internment camp, the author totally rips the book of any respect. I'm not sure if the author intended parts about ""turtles signifying penises"" or release of bodily gases as the high point of her relationship with her ex-boyfriend has anything to with the book or if it is just something to keep the reader's eye from closing, either way it is unnecessary and way off topic. If its anybody who needs continuing psychological help its Wil, whos view on her family wrecks every respect."
3,Quality drifted off-course slightly,"The front bumper is slightly crooked. The white decals on the left side don't quite match up. The trunk looks like it's sopposed to open, but doesn't. I've bought other scale model cars for around the same price w/better quality. Not one of Ertl's best efforts. But I'll keep it."
1,leaks-hate it,I even tried my own gasket-still leaks. I will not but again-I would not recommend it either. Sorry American Specialty.
3,the screw at the end doesn't screw tightly,my hose leaks when I tighten an attachment that can turn it on or off. This isn't an issue w/ my other hoses.
5,cvc408,This Weber is the best potable. Cooks like a champ. Leave on for 4 min on high and burn off all drippings on the bottom. A must buy.
4,Great Grill,We used this grill for a tailgate at ND football game and it worked great. It heated up really fast and cooked all our food without any problems and used very little gas. It took about 20 mins. to put together.
3,Good Price but very simple,Works great. Bought it for $50 and took it camping with me. Takes a bit to heat up. To get it heated up you need to place the lid on but allow a small gap to avoid choking the flame. Once you figure it out it works great. There is a learning curve with this grill as there is with most compact camping grills. Push-start is a big plus!
2,good price...,"Small gas grills get the job done. You don't need a Rolex to tell time...you don't need a $3000 grill to burn a burger. Unfortunately, if I didn't have my collection of screws, all I'd have is a pile of metal bits and pieces - they left out the screws for assembly. QA must not exist in that Chinese plant."
1,No Good,"I purchased this grill to use when camping and decided on this one because of the Weber name. While I will admit the grill is portable and easy to use, I am very disappointed with the way that it cooks. The heat shield that covers the flame makes cooking time very long. The grill is great for hot dogs and small burgers but if you want to cook anything else you better plan on an all day deal!!! It is definitely not worth the price."
2,Weak,"Nice igniter, It will last about 2 sessions. Watchout when you light it. It will blow. Chitty design. The whole que fills up with gas then really blows. Dont let Grandma start this one She will have a heart attack."
2,Well Built Product but not like charcoal,"My whole life I have only used charcoal so I decide to give gas a try. I have to say I was disappointed. I had cooked some Filet mignon and Hot dogs and the unit did a great job in cooking but the taste reminded me of a regular stove oven. I think if you are use to the taste of BBQ and never tried a gas unit before my recommendation would be to stick with what you know, especially if you want that BBQ taste. As for the company Weber I give the 5 stars in workmanship! You can't beat a product made in the USA!"
3,"It is all good, but I am not sure about the black oil dripped from the lid",I was happy with the product until I noticed one day there was a big drop of black oil on the steak I was cooking. I wiped the belly side of the lid with a paper towel and it was charcoal black. (I cooked with the lid closed.) Any ideas?
2,dissapointed !,We were sorely disappointed by this grill. Yes it cooks your food but it doesn't give the food the just off the grill flavor. It also takes an inordinate amount of time to cook meats and veggies. We used ours twice and we wont use it again. Oh well.
1,Negative 1 Star - LOOK ELSEWHERE!,"I've struggled with this cheaply made piece of junk for over two years, and after a final evening of frustration, it sailed off the 2nd floor deck in the general direction of the garbage dumpster. It doesn't heat up properly (some of these units heat properly, others like mine don't = POOR quality control), the way it cooks varies greatly depending on how much propane is in the can, and it takes only a slight breeze to blow it out. Beyond that, the plastic handle is cheesy, the heat shield will eventually burn through, and the whole unit will warp enough to make the grate difficult to take out and put back in. The push starter on mine worked only for a couple months and then broke. If you enjoy ruined meat and disappointed dinner guests, this it truly the unit for you. I'm going back to charcoal and going out of my way to NOT buy another Weber product because of the disappointment this grill has brought me."
4,Better that cheaper inports!,"This little grill is a very nice design. It was very easy to put together and the parts seem to be very high quality with the exception of the regulator valve. The valve seems very loose but works ok. You must be very careful when screwing the propane tank on because the regulator casting threads can strip easily as the metal is soft. That hasn't happened to me, I lubricated them and am very careful when screwing the tank on. The flame did blow out when set to medium or low. It wasn't very windy out at all when this happened. My advice, just use it on high, it doesn't get as hot as a larger grill using coals, but it gets the job done. I looked at many portable grilles before buying this one. Many of them were similar but the overall higher quality of this one was worth the few extra dollars. The BIGGEST advantage of buying the Weber is that if and when you need a replacement part, you will be able to get it from Weber."
3,Not all it was cracked up to be...,"I was excited about this grill, given the rave reviews I'd seen before purchasing it a few months ago. Although it cooks food well, it is a monumental pain to light. I've only used one propane cylinder, but in that space of time, the starter has ceased working. Lighting it by hand is difficult, given space constraints. I wouldn't buy it again, if I could avoid it."
3,Good standard grill,It cooks real well and the ability to put down wood chips adds flavor to the food.
5,Perfect,"We have this grill for a few months and we are more than happy with it.We don't have a big balcony but this one works perfect for our little space and it works great.one other thing that I like about it, is that I can wash all the parts after using it for a couple of times and that's great.I recommend it strongly to everyone.It really worth more than the price."
4,Works decent...,The auto starter does not work worth a dang. Have had to light with a lighter all but one time.
5,Excellent grill,Would definitely buy thus product again. Perfect for two. Stores anywhere and grill fits in the dishwasher.
2,Doesn't get hot enough,"Nice design, easy to assemble, but it just does not get hot enough to sear. It's a fairly small grill plate, and still not evenly hot. I'm very disappointed, especially since I purchased 2 Weber adapter hoses so I could use my full size propane tank, and both were destroyed by squirrels within a week. I wish I'd purchased the $30 portable grill at HD."
4,Handy grill,"I love to grill, but live in an apartment. I love to grill, but hate the mess of charcoal. The Weber Go Anywhere Grill has solved the problem. It is easy to use, clean and store. I used it for the first time last weekend. It was simple burgers, but I threw some mesquite chips wrapped in foil onto the flavor bar before I put the burgers on. They were delicious. I can't wait to do it with chicken this weekend!"
4,Great for tailgating.,You can fit two racks of precooked baby-back pork ribs on this grill. Easy to assemble and easy to use. Well worth the money.
2,Not Up to Weber Quality: 4 Year Owner,"I'm a huge Weber charcoal grill fan, but this grill is a rusted out POS. I've owned it for four years, and it lacks the durability I have come to expect from Weber.Weber essentially replaced all the parts when the grill was one year old because it rusted something awful and the ignition stopped working.Today I need to replace the grate that protects the gas element again ~ the cost with shipping is half the price of a new grill. The ignition doesn't work either. Again. Yes, I can light it manually, but this is a messy pain.It is a good introductory gas grill. It converted me from charcoal to gas. Steaks are done to perfection in 15 minutes or less. The other plus is that it doesn't take up much space on an apartment balcony.However, it is very cumbersome to use because the lid is not attached and the legs collapse easily.After reading the reviews, my next grill will be a Cuisinart. Yes, it is twice the cost. But, who needs a grill that rusts out and falls apart?"
5,Bang for the buck!,"Whole bakin chickens, strip steaks, burgers, whole poik loins;if it fits in this baby grille it'll be great. Weber's flavorizer hickeymajigger gives any meat that great grilled flavor without the flare ups. I've replaced my big old genisis with it as I'm only cooking for one or two now. Grear for camping or friend's picinics as it folds up so small. Do'nt be fooled by the piece of crap chinease lookalike next to it at chin-Lowes or china Depo: get the weber. Really! been a fan of Weber flaor for 30 years plus and this little guy really delivers."
2,dangerous starter,"The grill works fine. However, the automatic starter is dangerous. By the time it is hit, there is enough gas to make a loud bang and flash that scares me. I will use a manual lighter instead."
3,OK but not great,This grill is nicely portable but needs little more burner power. It does not get quite hot enough to do steaks right. I was able to cook a whole chicken in ours on low burner. The peizo lighter stopped working after just a few uses. Overall I liked my Sunbeam portable slightly better.
3,Weber go anywhere gas grill,"I purchased this grill, it was not a problem to put it together about 30 minutes.It's not heavy to carry, seems to be of fairly high quality materials. (That's the good)I gave it a trial run, the only problems I found were the handles do get very hot both sidesand the lid don't grab any of these without a hotpad!!!Since the burner sets a bit on the shallow side in the unit, it was hard to tell when it was lit in the sunlight.Another problem is if you would use it in a fairly windy condition as at the ocean side, I think the wind could blow the flame out, on high it's not a very strong flame about 1/2 inch.and on low the flame only comes out about 1/8 to 1/4 inch.When I gave mine the trial run on medium in a light breeze (lid on) it stayed lit, but was just staying lit.For the price it's OK for use under certain conditions.I also purchased the 6 foot hose from Home Depot to hook it to a 20 pound cylinder."
5,Very happy with the purchase,We used it on a camping trip and it worked great. No issues whatsoever. Highly recommend this small gas grill even for backyard use if cooking for 4 or less people.
5,This is a great little Grill for camping!,"This is a great little Grill for camping! ya gotta put it together from a bag of parts the first time you use it ( a supprize to me while camping! ). but after i got it all built (5 min tops) it worked great, and folded up and went under the sink in my little camper!"
2,Too fragile,After reading other buyer's reviews I expected a more solid item. The metal is very thin and will probably rust out if not treated with care. The fire was not very hot and I would not recommend it for anything more than hot dogs or hamburgers
4,nice,"my last little grill finally died on me, I was very tough on it, it must of been 10+ years old. This new weber has some nice little additions to it from the old style. I like the plastic handles, etc."
3,Built like a little tank,"Built like a Weber should be, but burner only heats one side of the grill, and it's on the far side of the grill. I thought Weber was sending a part, but never got it, will re-contact."
4,Product Description Could be MORE DETAILED,Great product especially for areas where charcoal is not allowed. Description however did not detail that propane was not included nor did it say that it was included. Had to take a chance and wait and see... Really made for poor planning.
4,Weber 1520 Propane Gas Go-Anywhere Grill,We recently bought this as a replacement for our previous Weber that has lasted over 10 years. Good height to minimize grease flare ups.It is light and effective on camping vacations.We use to buy other competing models at Canadian tire that lasted only 2 years at most due to burner failure.
4,Not a good cooker at high altitude!,"Tested it out at home, it worked great. Planned several meals around the use of this grill on a camping trip to the San Juan mountains of Colorado. At 11,000 feet it only got ""warm"". It never really cooked anything, but it did a good job of dehydrating everything. The charcoal version of this grill would have been a better choice for that situation. It works fine at my home, 5000 feet elevation."
4,Awesome Lil Grill,"This grill is a great alternative to the expensive larger Q grills, perfect for an entry level Weber for an apartment etc. the only thing I can think of that I dont care for is the handle gets very hot so be careful."
2,Overpriced and flimsy,"I looked around alot for a good small tabletop propane grill, and thi swas the only one I could find. I do not like it at all, it is very small, and has no cover that moves, you have to pull it off and set it down, it does not fold up. It also takes forever to cook a steak, and the low setting is useless. Very small surface and heavy and clunky too, the $19.00 i got at Wal mart was much better. Save your $$."
3,weber tabletop gas grill,I purchased the tabletop Weber gas grill because of the of the Weber name. The gas regulator does not work. It leaks gas even though the knob is in the off/locked postion. I have to remove the gas tank after each use. I would like to get a replacement regulator but can't contact info for Amazon (they were the seller) Also the temperature is not even---one side of the grill gets hotter than the other. The handle gets very hot--too hot to touch so you must use a pad to lift the grill top.
4,Doesn't get quite hot enough for steaks,"Doesn't get quite hot enough for steaks (in my opinion), but fine for chicken, brats, etc. Some assembly required, but just be patient and follow the directions. A very solid and well built product."
4,Great Grill,This is a great grill. I have cooked tons on it. Easy to put together. Everything working awesome. Def a great value. Perfect to grill on the terrace of my one bedroom apartment.
3,Weber Go Anywhere Grill,"Really disappointed that no where on the website was it mentioned that the grill required the long thin propane bottle, the kind one does not see for sale ANYWHERE, though I did finally find it at Walmart. Didn't have the right propane bottle a couple of weeks ago at 6500 feet, so could not use the grill.Had one of these grills for 15 or 20 years previously, and it worked great. Hope this one does as well."
4,Awsome Grill!,Theres not too much to say other than this little portable weber rocks! it cleans up easily and grills really well. it gets a little hot when you grill on high so dont put it on a plastic table or anything.
1,Not what I expected from a Weber,"I thought the number of positive reviews meant that this is a solid grill. Unfortunately, it seems to be more in line with the negative reviews.The first issue I have is with the starter. I have tried placing it at different distances from the gas pipe, but no luck. I have to use a lighter to start the grill.Secondly, it doesn't get hot. I've cooked hotdogs, brats, and a veggie patty on the grill and I barely saw any burn marks on the dogs. They also took forever to cook. I guess it might be a grill that requires having the lid on. I would never try to cook a steak on it and I'm hesitant to toss a chicken breast on it.The heat is also uneven right-to-left. I wouldn't expect to cook a variety of foods on this sized grill at any time so the heat should be more uniform."
2,Not reliable,"I've owned this grill for about 4 years. I originally bought it because it was small and would store in my R.V.. I started having problems with it not heating up or going out altogether and having to be re-lit a lot. I would sometimes have to shake the bottle and then it would cook o.k. for a while. I've replaced the temp/regulator control valve twice so far: I sometimes seem to get a good flame if I use a pair of vise-grips to hold the dial down. I've switched to a bulk propane tank and there are times (like on Superbowl Sunday trying to cook wings for friends) when the grill simply would not heat up, kept going out and I ended up pan frying the wings in the house. And there is no flame height difference between low to high. It's all the same. 'C'mon Weber: this is a simple B.B.Q! Make it work right! Use a quality temp control/regulator valve not made in Korea!"
1,Go anywhere weber grill,"Not sure if this is a problem with the entire line or just the one I bought, but after spending the time putting it together and attaching the small propane tank, and after a few tries at getting it to start with the ignitor, it only produced a minimal flame even on high. After 2O minutes on this grill the thin chicken tenderloin strips weren't even starting to cook. Had to take them inside and finish them in the skillet on the stove. On other grills these usually cook great in about 4 minutes. Very disappointed and returning the product."
3,"Portable and well built, not so hot.","Cooks evenly, and is very well built. Good grill for the price. It's only drawback is that is does not heat up enough to sear meat, and is not very wind resistant."
5,Phenomenal grill for camping,"While we've used Coleman folding stoves for years, if you have trunk space, there is no reason on earth to limit yourself to a small stove when you can grill with this wonderful tabletop grill. The small tank makes this practical for camping. If you want real barbecue while tenting under the stars, and you camp where a tailgate or a picnic table is available, this is a great choice for camping equipment. We still like the Coleman for boiling water, but I love barbecuing on a propane grill like this."
5,great camping grill,"This is a really good camping grill. Lights very easy without matches. You can use the fat round gas cylinders okay even though the instructions call for the long thin clyinders. I have cooked steaks, hamburgers and hotdogs on it so far and they have turned out great. No burnt food either. Even used it to feed a crowd of 12 people. You can cook about 6 burgers at a time. No sticking of the food on the grate. I have had several small grills over the past 15 years and without a doubt this is the best one yet."
2,Quality not up to cost,"I had 2 of these thinking that the first one was defective. I ended up returning the second one also. The handles got to hot to touch after a few minutes of grilling. I also had a fire under the ""flavorizer"" bars that are supposed to vaporize all drippings, that I thought was going to get out of control and blow up the propane tank.For what this unit costs, I guess I wanted more from it."
2,Poor Quality Sound,"This CD had a possibility of being quite good, however, the sound quality is such that the listening enjoyment is diminished severely."
5,Outstanding record,"This was recorded in 1973, and I got the LP a couple of years later. It blew me completely at the time and I still enjoy every minute of it. I tried to find more of the same with Burton, but this was a one-time collaboration by this unit, unfortunately. None of Burtons records, at least at the time, came close to this one. I listened to Ring, Passengers, Times Square and more, but none had the powerful, swinging, joyous playing of this one. The group is really a group here and they keep everything very together, like a living entity. Everybody plays great. Guitarist Mick Goodricks intricate lines are clear as crystal, I have never heard him played better. Abraham Laboriel plays like nobody else and has an enormous drive. He plays some furious bass solos too, and drummer Harry Blazer sounds just right.The writing is equally exiting with contributions from Burton, Corea, Michael Gibbs, Gordon Beck, Carla Bley and Keith Jarrett."
5,Awesome,"Anxiously awaited arrival of this book, since it was referred to me by the reviews on Amazon.com. It is an exceptional book for someone who loves knitting and wants to learn more about ""Ganseys"" The sample sweater looks intriguing. Just from reading the book, before jumping in to knit something, I learned a lot. I am enjoying this book immensely. Can't wait to start knitting...Very glad I purchased it. And, the price was right ( I would have paid more)"
5,Fun and versatile...,I love these sweaters because I don't need to do a lot of cables. I pick and choose designs and this book makes my work look impressive no matter whether I do complicated cables or easy knit and purling.
3,not like the original,The book had the handsome color copy of the original but the pages are only copies....not colored photos.Very shocked by that since I was expecting this to be the same as the original.The information is still valuable....
5,An excellent reference,"Knitting Ganseys is a clearly written book covering the history, technique and method of knitting gansey sweaters. This is more than a collection of patterns - Beth Brown-Reinsel explains the whys of each step & sweater section as well as the traditional alternatives. Her photos and charts are clear, and each chart has a legend - one doesn't need to flip back to the first chart to find an explanation of an obscure symbol. I would recommend this as a first sweater book, provided one already knows how to knit & purl in the round."
4,All in all a good book,"Has, single column references, and is a little bit thicker than advertised (1.8""). Has for pages of maps, a one page introduction, printed in Moscow, has a short concordance (16 pages)."
3,No apocrapha,"Russian Orthodox Christians have a larger canon of Scripture, but this Bible doesn't. Why? What makes it Synodal? All of Scripture is a great blessing and wonder, even a partial version. If you want to reach all Russians, take into consideration the entire version most Russians accept please."
1,Russian Bible--FL--Synod,"I have returned this item. The print was much too small and seemed even smaller than what was shown on the sample online--though that might have been a different version. There were few choices available, and I was very disappointed in the whole transaction though I believe a refund is in the works. I am still looking for a Russian Bible with standard sized print. Thank you for asking.John H. Loving."
3,Sloppy manufacturing tolerances?,"I also own a four year old model of this grill and the new grill is of much lower quality. The mounting ring for the ash bucket is too small to allow a proper fit of the bucket . The charcoal grate's diameter is too small and will tip off the welded mounting tangs inside the grill's bottom. The new grill does not come with an integrated lid holder. The grill legs fall away from the bottom of the grill if you lift the grill or wheel the grill over bumpy terrain. The new grill also costs $20.00 more than the four-year old grill. Even the Weber packaging and product manual reeked of cheap, cheap, cheap.Weber is apparently de-contenting their grills and not paying attention to their manufacturing process or, I purchased a counterfeit Weber. I would not recommend this grill at the advertised price of $150.00"
2,Box was opened and beat-up,I hope everything was in the box it was very beat up I did not want to take everything out because I knew i could not get it back in the box and it had to go to Germany with my son in the airforce. just hope everything is there
3,Not as good as they used to be,"I have always liked the design of the weber grills, but the quality is definitely getting worse. I heard somewhere that Weber is having their grills made in China. On my latest grill, The lid does not fit very securely. It is very easy to knock off and is hard to get sealed so that the grill is not sucking air from around the middle."
2,Not even close to the older versions,"I got this for Christmas a year ago to replace my 1983 version. I use it side by side with my 28-year old copy. They aren't even close. The 1983 version has much thicker metal, a bullet-proof porcelain finish, much thicker rods on the grill. After more than 20 moves involving dis-assembly the 28-year old grill still outshines the new model. I have already dented the lid and scuffed paint off the new one! It cooks like the old one so I give it points for that."
3,What's with the sharp edges?,"I love the Weber Kettle way of grilling, It provides the best way to do charcoal grilling short of a double barrel smoker system.I have been using my 18.5 grill for over 4 years and it's still going strong. I upgraded to a 22.5 unit so I can cook bigger items and I find it to be more cumbersome.My biggest complaint. The sharp edge around the lid combined with the short length of the handle to move the grill. I end up cutting or burning my knuckles.For the price they charge for the grill, they could have taken the time to round out the sharp edge and lengthen the handle so it is not so close to the sharp/hot lid.I tried to contact Weber about this issue and they do not return phone calls."
4,Had Weber long ago and am going back home!,"My husband loved the Weber Kettle and is glad to get the new one. We got a 22.5 inch and like it, but wished we had gotten the 27""...wanted more space. The only problem is the handle on the lid. We had a wooden one on our old one and the plastic gets so hot, you cannot touch it! That part should be replaced with the old wooden one. We bought a Weber glove, so we could pick it up."
4,Gas < Charcoal,"Yes, Charcoal takes longer to heat up, and is more messy to deal with, but the taste is great. If you're just starting out grilling, pick one of these up. It'll last a super long time. Also, you should probably get a cover for it if it's sitting outside in the elements.Cons? You need a side table for plates etc, and a built-in thermometer would be nice. However, that stuff can be done DIY style, or upgrade to a nicer model.It cooks great though. The ash catcher is a handy feature."
5,BBQ Bliss,Weber does it again! Awesome product. Everything my husband wanted. We have a gas grill at home for the quick BBQ nights but prefer the charcoal in the Weber most other times. We also own a Baby Q which we take camping. Great products!
5,Love this grill!,This is my second Weber...the first lasting me about 7 years. We like charcoal (instead of gas) and the Weber is a wonderful all-around grill.
5,Grill Daddy,"We have cooked with Weber Kettles for many, many years and this is just a wonderful updated version of the grill. Much easier to shut down and the food cooks very evenly."
5,You Get What You Pay For,"You will pay more for a Weber than its competitors, but quality of the product is better. The grill cooks well, is built well, and should last for many years to come."
4,Weber Gold,"Have always been a Weber fan, but, due to financial circumstances, had to opt for the charcoal portable run about, offbrand seen in the big box stores. In the interum, also opted for a propane models from various manufacturers. Not a fan of propane. Give me charcoal.Went back to Weber gold this year for summer barbque season and am so relieved to be again using a Weber.A couple things that other reviewers have also noted:Lid handle needs to move back to the old wood type or a type that does not heat up. Would like to order if Weber makes one available.The lid tends to move off the bowl when moving to another location for BBQ'ing. Larger lip would eliminate this issue. Did'nt have this with my older models, pre 1990. Don't know when this change was made."
1,poor packaging,The kettle was egg shaped when it arrived having been mishandled in shipping. Not an easy item to ship. The enamel was chipped off the rim of the kettle and the lid would not sit on the kettle. Decided to buy one at Home Depot rather than go thru the aggravation after having to rebox and return this large item.
1,Bent,Was very disappointed with this product. I bought it used to save a few dollars...the main leg is bent and the grate inside is all bent that leaves a space for food to fall thru. Won t buy used again..
5,It's a Weber!,"The Weber 22.5 inch grill is truly the best for those of us who enjoy charcoal grilling. The One-Touch Gold model has the convenient ash catcher which is a big plus if you grill a lot. The venting system allows for a slow to quick burn, thereby controlling the fire's temperature. If you are new to charcoal grilling, this is the grill to learn on, experiment, have fun and enjoy good tasting food that can only come from charcoal and wood."
5,"The classic grill, improved","The classic Weber grill, improved.Weber's been making this grill in one version or another forever.There's a good reason - it's nearly perfect.Unlike square grills, the shape lends itself to even heat distribution for even cooking. Temperature control is easy with the top and bottom adjustable vents.Emptying the ashes is painless thanks to the ash catcher. Just move the bottom vent handle back and forth a couple of times to dump the ashes through the vent holes, then rotate the ash catcher handle a little to remove. Disposal is quick and mess-free.It's the best cooking charcoal grill out there, but you can add accessories like the rotisserie, top slide aside, tool holder, work table, condiment tray, indirect cooking baskets, etc... you get the idea."
5,Weber Grill,"This is truly the best grill, Weber Grill Still Made In The USA.You may pay more but its last a lifetime..."
5,Best charcoal grill!,We LOVE this grill. The convenience of the ash catcher is the best detail!! Can never go wrong with a Weber!
3,Quality Control?,"I had my reservations because of some of the ""made in China"" reviews on here. Mine arrived via FedEx 15 minutes ago. The box is not damaged. The lid though, is dented on the lip for about 3 inches and under one side of the lid handle you can see bare steel--this WILL rust.The body has no issues. It's as if the lid was dropped before packing damaging the top handle and denting the lip--and it was packed anyway. Unacceptable for a 149.00 charcoal grill.I shot Weber an email--I'll report back.UPDATE 7 minutes after I wrote this. I AM STUNNED. While I wrote the above review I had already (as I said) shot Weber an email. When I posted the review I checked my email and they responded! NOW FOLKS THAT'S LIGHTENING CUSTOMER SERVICE! Where do you see that these days???"
3,Not like it used to be.,I just purchased this grill as a gift since our 10+ yr. old Weber was and is really great. I like my old Weber grill much better. The handles on this grill get really hot and you will need a pot holder to lift the lid. The absence of the lid lock means there is no place to put the lid but on the ground. My old grill allows me to just slide the lid back. This grill also is lacking a thermometer on the lid. Some things are better left alone and this is one good example. Plus it arrived damaged.
3,The best charcoal grill for the money HOWEVER see below:,"Having owned a number of other brands of charcoal grills, I can say that Weber is by far the best for your money and also the longevity of the product.My concern with my most recent purchase of this Weber grill is the engineering tolerances and design. The lid does not fill perfectly on top of the grill. It feels wobbly and unstable at best.A second annoyance, the legs will easily fall off if the unit is picked up by the ceramic base.Aside from that the product works flawlessly. The ash catcher works well, especially if you live in an urban environment and don't want to make a mess of your ""backyard"".IN SUMMARY:I would still recommend the product, however check the pieces over very carefully and make sure they all fit well. It not, return it or call Weber directly and request for a new piece."
2,The lid is WAY TOO LOOSE,"I ordered one these from Amazon, got it, put it together, and noticed it was out of round and the lid was wobbly and had big gaps. I sent it back for an exchange. Amazon is very good about returns and exchanges so I received a new one just a few days later. The packaging looked great, no tears or smashed box. I put it together and sure enough, this time it is not out of round, it's just a BAD FIT between the lid and the bowl. I believe the quality of these grills has dimished over just the past couple years. I used a friend of mine's one touch silver that is two or three years old and her lid fits great! I'm very sad to write this review because I've always been a big Weber fan, I have a Weber Smokey Mountain cooker that I absolutely LOVE! Wish I could say the same about this. I've given up an the Weber kettle because all the ones I try at the stores have this same loose fitting lid problem."
2,Not worth 66% more than the Silver model,"Weber has deleted the thermometer and lid holder from this previously great grill. Now, for a 66% premium, the only difference between the Gold and Silver models is the ash catcher and hinged grill, what a rip! Buy the Silver model and save yourself about $60.00!"
5,Great Customer Service,"Bought this grill about 2 yrs. ago and its an excellent performer. However, about three months ago I noticed that the cover was going out of round with the kettle and it wouldn't seal properly. I went to the Weber website to purchase a replacement cover and couldn't find it as an available part for purchase so I called customer service. Before I knew it, the service representative was verifying my address to send me a replacement cover, no questions asked. I have seen some of the posts here about customer service, but was a little skeptical. I'm not anymore. A really pleasant surprise. Great product, great company."
3,Old Standard,Good quality item. I replaced my 10 yr old previous kettle. I really miss the special lid holder frame that my previous kettle had.
2,Its ok,My husband wanted this grill because it had good reviews. After we got it one of the legs came pretty bent in but we didn't want to return the product already because we needed it for the weekend. Another downside is that the lid doesn't latch on to anything so when grilling and the lid is hot you have to hold the lid in your hand. Thats very inconvenient because you cant put it down since its hot so that leaves you only one hand to grill with. Pretty disappointed.
3,Weber needs to check their Quality Measures,"I've owned a Weber 22.5"" kettle grill ever since I was a young adult. I have to say that the one I just bought has some quality issues and Weber needs to address these issues before they start to lose customers.a), the charcoal grate doesn't fit the four-point resting tongues (I had to adjust them with a pair of pliers). It seems that the tongues are either in the wrong position or the grate is too small.b), The Grill doesn't rest evenly on the four-point resting tongues either (I had to adjust these as well).My last Weber grill was the 10th Anniversary Edition, Simpson 22.5"". That grill was perfect until the day it died. I sold it on eBay.I've been happy with Weber products in the past but this new grill leaves me wondering if I should go Gas the next time.... I might as well die."
5,Great Charcoal Grill,I'm extremely pleased with this very well made grill. The only improvement I can think of would be for the lid to be mounted so it doesn't have to be completely removed each time it is opened.
5,Good Buy,I am very pleased we purchased this grill! I was shocked at how big it was when we put it together. The grate was easy to clean and you simply move a latch and the ashes fall into the catcher. This grill is going to hold up for a very long time!
5,charcoal grill,The Weber grill has user friendly features not found on most other charcoal grills. It does a good job of smoking in addition to grilling.I prefer it to my gas grill for big items.
5,Still MADE IN THE USA!,"Not sure where those other reviewers got their information???I called Weber this morning and verified that they only manufacture kettle grills in their factory in the USA. The Spirit gas grills are China, but pretty much every other grill is USA made.The Gold grills is the way to go. A lot of reviews overlooked the fact that the Gold grill also gives you Stainless Steel ash removal parts in the bottom of the grill vs. the alumanized steel ones in the Silver grills.I have an 18.5"" Silver and a Green 22.5"" Gold and I wish the 18.5 was a Gold level grill, but both are working just great.Yes the plastic (nylon re-inforced) handles are not as good as the wood ones were. But the quality of everything else is still the best that's out there and WELL WORTH the price. With proper care, these grills last 20+ years. And are still MADE IN THE USA... What more could you want?"
5,It's a Weber,"I have been fortunate enough to have been around Weber grills for most of my life. When we were first married, we had a small one. After many years, it gave up the battle and we threw it out. Now, we decided to purchase a large one. I love the new features on the grill, the rack that has sides that lift. This is great, no more moving the grill out of the way to add wood or charcoal. I love the no touch ash system on this grill, it beats having ash every where.Easy to put together, the hubby did that in record time.The one thing I can say about Weber grills is that they last a long time. A great and smart purchase."
5,"Simple, Effective Classic","There's not much more you could ask for in a grill. It's simple and effective, which is exactly what I look for in a charcoal grill. It was very easy to assemble--the whole process took me 30 minutes. I'm used to gas grills, and so I was worried that there would be a learning curve to using a charcoal grill. Not with this grill. I was up and running in no time.My only complaint is that the cleaning system has a tendency to get jammed, which is not something you want to be fiddling with with a grill full of hot coals. But once the grill cooled down, I was able to get the cleaning system working again.All in all, this grill lives up to the Weber name."
4,webber products,"Very good product. The Weber[ASIN:B00004RALR Weber 751001 22 1/2-Inch One-Touch Gold Charcoal Grill, Black]] grill is made in the USA. It is hard to find products still made here."
2,"After a lot of chances, they do not deliver.","We have just lost the ignitor after one year with the current Weber Grill. We have bought 7 over the past 3 years as we own a vacation home as well. We have upgraded, several times, after reading reviews, thinking maybe we were not buying the best of the line. Didn't matter. We maintain, we clean, and in all honesty, we don't use it as much as most people, probably. Not happy. Moving on, hopefully to find a grill that lasts more than a year or two. I think Weber, unsucessfully, rests on their reputation."
1,"Two Up, Two Down","I really wanted to like this grill. I bought it because my friend has the same model (older construction, but same model), and he grills like a fiend on it. So, when my wife's subtle hinting that it would be great if we could grill became insistent, I ordered this one up.Got the first one on time, but, when I opened it up, the bottom kettle was significantly dented near one of the leg insertions, so much so that it couldn't be assembled, and the finish was flaking inside the kettle. Luckily, Amazon is great on returns, so I sent it back (on their dime) for a replacement.The second one arrived over night (thanks again, Amazon!), and, lo and behold, the handles on this one was bent radically out of shape, with the finish flaking off the handle and on the outside of the kettle near the handle.I'm not sure what, exactly, is going on with Weber, but, with the quality I'm seeing on these grills and the price they're asking, I just don't think they're a good risk..."
4,good~~~~~~~~~~~,"good~~~~~~~~~~~Weber 751001 22 1/2-Inch One-Touch Gold Charcoal Grill, BlackWeber 751001 22 1/2-Inch One-Touch Gold Charcoal Grill, Black"
3,Some improvements aren't,"The One-Touch grill cooks just as well as the old Weber kettles I've used over the past 30 years, and is easier to clean, but...Weber has replaced the wooden handles on the grill and top with a plastic or composite of some sort, and if the top stays over the fire for a significant period of time (15 minutes or so), the handle gets almost too hot to hold. I'm a disappointed long-term Weber fan."
4,Weber Charcoal Grill,I love the Weber charcoal kettle grill. The only thing that would make it better is if it had a temperature gauge on the lid for slow cooking and rotisserie.
4,Great Grill / Ash Catcher Level can get stuck....,"What I love...+I love the solid shiny Kettle. It looks very sleek.+It is extremely easy to assemble.+Great Size (although I do wish I went with the larger one for a family for 4)What I dislike...-Although the wheel look fine the feel cheap, I am afraid they will crack, although must people do not wheel their grill around too much.-I'm not sure what it is called but the little level attached to the ash catcher is sometimes are to move and scraps against the actual ash catcher. It gets stuck often, which can be challenging when grill is hot.Overall great grill, well built, and hope to continue to use for years to come"
5,Good eating,"Gave this as a present and it had a damaged handle, Weber sent a replacement sitting at our door in two days with no questions ask. Good product to buy."
5,Its a machine!,"You can grill/ bbq/ smoke just about anything shy of a half a large animal on this. Im glad I went with the 22.5. Will move up to the 26 later when needed. There are so many things you can do with this when adding other attachments (smokenator, rotisserie, pizza oven, iron grates, wok, skillet, the list goes on)."
2,Queen of the Damned/Interview with the Vampire,The movies are good.It is not the movies that I have a problem with. It is the FORMAT.QUEEN of the DAMNED is FULL SCREENINTERVIEW with the VAMPIRE is WIDE SCREEN
5,Love both movies,"Both of these movies are great movies in the vampire genre. First we have Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt in Interview with the Vampire. I didn't watch this movie when it first came out, but when i finally did I was extremely happy with the parts that both men played. Queen of the Damned was a bit different story, but one that pushed in a direction i've liked linking Hard Rock and vampires. I highly recommend both of these."
2,Would be nice if it worked in France,"This adapter did not work with the plugs I confronted in France recently. Last I checked, France is part of Europe. ""Old europe"" perhaps, but Europe still.The grounding pole in the outlet hits into the plastic on the adapter so the adapter cannot be inserted into the outlet. Perhaps in other countries the grounding pole is further from the middle of the outlet so that this would work properly. But not in France.Otherwise it's a solid adapter. The UK version I bought worked quite nicely and this has similar construction quality.(BTW, to Amazon's credit, they accepted the return for a full refund)."
1,BEWARE,"Be careful before ordering this item. Although designated as an European adaptor, it does NOT work in Switzerland."
1,not the right plug!,"They shouldn't say this is for Europe, because it works nowhere in England or Ireland that I was visiting. It was basically a $10 chunk of plastic to lug around. For England and Ireland, you need the plugs with three flat prongs. I ended up spending 10 pounds on new plugs once I got there."
3,Handy for Clinicals,I am required to bring med cards to clinical and (like all nursing students) have limited time to write them out. These cards saved me a bundle of time. My only criticism is that not all the drugs from my Davis's Drug Guide book are included in these cards. I was very surprised to find Pitocin was not included since it is a pretty standard drug in Labor and Delivery. The cards include all of the necessary information for safe administration of meds and also includes a handy little plastic pouch to carry to clinical.
2,What's the point?,"I am second semester nursing student and purchased this deck as a better option to my Davis Drug Guide. I was disappointed with the Med Deck because it had exactly the same information as my book, but spread out over 2 or 3 large cards (front and back). The deck doesn't come with tabs so it made it hard to find the drug cards quickly. The plastic sleeve can barely hold 2 cards and I found that a single drug can have up to 3 cards. I discovered that free apps like Micromedex or Medscape are better, more efficient options to looking up drugs while doing clinicals."
2,I wanted to like this film,"I am a fan of independent film, and a black-and-white zombie film--well, Romero and the originalNight of the Living Deadcertainly come to mind. Unfortunately, I found too little here to like.The film begins with a man named Eric killing a zombie. Soon, Greg and Jesse show up, claiming their car has broken down and asking for shelter. Eric reluctantly takes them into his RV and then begins with a series of statements redolent of macho nonsense. Since he has the gun, it seems Greg and Jesse have no choice but to go along. And yet they don't.The main problem for me with this film was the combination of stilted acting and the characters' ill-considered choices. The 23-minute film is not long enough to explore the claustrophobia that was so effective in Romero's film, and the characters (or actors) are never really free to escape their one-dimensional roles."
1,You guys need quality control,The fact that you have this for sell in and of itself screams for oversight. If it's to crappy for you to watch on your end then more than likely it's to crappy for your customers to watch. I mean come on now. really.
2,No Pictures,"Even great recepies with no pictures to show in how to present the food as a gift, end up been just a cook book."
1,The mouse that couldn't,"Don't waste your money, the product is still in its infancy. It is made of cheap plastic, batteries (which it consumes faster than cheese) are hard to replace.The response of the mouse is poor and lags as you move it around. It doesn't know how to accelerate properly. And if the signal goes out of sync with the base unit you can expect frustration getting them to talk to each other. Stick to a wired optical mouse."
1,Wish I had read reviews before I bought it!,"After having spent years loving all of my nice (old-fashioned) MS mice, and being an avid user of practically ALL of their software (OS, development, Office, BackOffice, etc.), I am so unimpressed. I wish I had read the reviews about this thing. When my problem cropped up on my second day, I did a Google search only to find almost everyone who bought it wishing that they hadn't. Me too. It does this thing where the clicks won't register unless it's also in motion... sometimes. As the other reviews preach, I can expect to go through and uninstall Intellipoint 4.1, delete lots of stuff from the registry (this is also Microsoft's answer), and then it will probably work for a couple more days before I just throw it away. $... out the window.And this thing is still on the shelves!!"
1,"DONT BUY THIS, IT DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT!","Read the other reviews about the mouse pointer jumping to the bottom corners of the screen. This mouse just FEELS wrongs to use, I threw mine in a drawer and now use my old Microsoft Mouse. This disappointed me, because I have always loved Microsoft Mice, and have an IntelliEye mouse at work that is the best ... Spend more money and buy another mouse, and dont throw out the packaging!"
2,It worked great ...for 6 weeks (m),"I got this mouse as a Christmas gift. I installed it with no problem (despite the fact that the enclosed software didn't work on my PC) and it worked great. I loved the fact that it was optical because I no longer needed a mouse pad and there was no ball to get covered in cat fur. I also loved not having a cord under my desk to get tangled up in and I was considering getting a wireless keyboard to go with it. 6 weeks to the day after I installed it, it quit working. I tried rebooting, replacing the batteries, changing the channel, reconnecting with the receiver and the best I could get was jerky movements that were hard to control and the left button didn't work. I'm hoping I can return it for store credit and then try the Logitech."
4,"Excellent Optical Mouse, but lacks features of prior version","I have used many different versions of Microsoft's wireless and wired optical mice. Their most recent addition to the pointing device family is excellent with the notable exception of the back and forward buttons generally found on higher end mice. The scroll wheel is a bit larger than previous versions, which is a nice plus. The wireless functionality works flawlessly through its USB connection and the mouse fits nicely in an average sized hand."
1,This item was not for me..But the seller had great service,i bought this item had it for about two weeks the all of a sudden in order to get the mouse to move i have to wiggle and shake it... and in order to click only the left button i had to like tap it multiple times just to get it to hit the button...and then the most recent problem which caused me to go and buy new is if i did not have the mouse at the perfect angle for the receiver it would loose its signal i am not sure if there was some sort of damage during shipmen or what but i have never had a mouse before do that would not recommend the product but the seller has great service..fast shipping
1,forget it,"Pointer jumps off screen constantly - major problem. If you like gaming - don't get this mouse. If you like frustration - this thing is perfect for you. Can this mouse really be called a ""precision pointing device"" when the pointer disppears every few minutes? I think not. I was much happier with the Microsoft corded Optical Intellimouse, which only cost me 1/2 as much as this."
2,Don't bother,"Easy to install, but annoying to use. Seems to have a delay before the cursor moves, then kind of catches up to you."
1,Jumping around,"The mouse is not working after 1 month of ownership. Open it up, found that it uses quad-coil IF method for the the wireless receiver, which is susceptible to shock or vibration. Don't buy it."
2,Sending mine back....,"I have a Logitech wireless keyboard and Logitech optical mouse, both of which I love. But, I thought a wireless mouse would be great and I regretted not buying one initially. However, the MS Blue version is way too jumpy and nothing I adjusted really seemed to help. I'm back to my wired Logitech optical and sending this one in!"
1,STEER CLEAR,...I used it for a while and when i would play games the mouse would jump and even surfing the net was a difficult task. You get what you pay for with a cordless mouse. For a cordless mouse equal to a 30 dollar cord optical mouse you would need to buy a cordless worth 80. Dont buy a cheap cordless mouse they just dont work. I recomend a logitech mx300 or a dual optical you will then get precise mousing for the same price. THIS MOUSE DOES NOT OUTPERFORM A BALL MOUSE so unless you want to sit there ignorantly pretending the mouse actually performs well as you get out kick of seeing a cordless optical mouse YOU SHOULD STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRDOUCT. BUY LOGITECH CORD OPTICAL YOU WONT REGRET IT! IF YOU ARE A GAMER YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PLAY WITH THIS MOUSE! SO IN SUMMARY STICK WITH YOUR BALL MOUSE OVER THIS PIECE OF JUNK.
2,stops working after a while.,"This mouse worked great (while it was working). Now it will not click on anything without a lot of multiple double clicks, or clicking and draging slowly. Optical is nice, but I reccomend buying a logitec ( I have heard no complaints about them) or just buy a corded optical.I got this as a gift for a friend (Thanks Microsoft). Now it does not work for them and I can't find any information on the microsoft web site about how to fix it. I have updated the driver, put new batteries in, and it still does not work. Even if I do find a fix for it, is it really worth all this tr"
3,Great mouse - but one major flaw,"Picked up this mouse on a whim. I have always been a fan of wireless optical mice. Unfortunately, this mouse has one flaw. When I come into work in the morning the mouse is non-reponsive and I have to remove the batteries and replace them to get it to respond.I think this is because I leave my computer on during the night and the mouse senses the lack of activity and goes to sleep. I think installing the intellipoint software may help resolve this.Other than that problem - it's a great mouse. very comfortable and accurate."
1,"40 dollars down the drain, thanks RadioShak","I made the mistake of buying mine from RadioShaft because I was in a hurry. The mouse worked great at first. It did jump around for no apparent reason, mostly to the bottom left corner of the screen. Then it stopped working all together after about a week. Like so many others, I tried to fix it in vain. I tried to return it but according to RadioShark, when I threw out the packaging, i threw away my money back, although i had the reciept. Boo hoo. Never shop there, especially for this mouse."
1,"Worked great, Until it died","Installed and worked immeadiately . . . until it died 5 minutes later.The Win-XP Device Manager shows it is installed and working properly, but it no longer controls the cursor. Un-installing and re-installing did not fix the problem, nor did changing channels. What could possibly be the problem with these things?"
2,Not working scroll bar,"I liked the mouse overall, but the scroll function didn't work. Very little ""troubleshooting"" in the software, Microsoft online support basically told me to reinstall drivers, etc. Even though I performed initial installation correctly, I redid it, with no improvement. I'll be returning it for a mouse that works correctly - I like the scroll wheel function in a mouse, and am not willing to trade it in, in case a mechanical problem, since it'd be at risk to not work again.."
3,scientist,"Its a good plug and play wireless mouse, but i think its not an engineering marvel. This microscoft product being cheaper than its competitors has manufacturing blemishes. The one I bought makes screeching noises when clicked.The wireless makes no difference in traditional computer use. This one has a cumbursome 2 meter chord with the receiver and therefore its like carrying two mice instead of one with your notebook."
1,More clutter than a standard mouse!,"I was very surprised upon opening the wireless mouse packaging to discover that the receiver (with very long cord) is about five times the size of my wireless network card. I cannot understand why a mouse would require such a large receiver. Furthermore, this totally defeats the purpose of buying the product if you want to reduce cords and clutter. This should be shown in the product information provided."
5,Microsoft Wireless Optical Mouse Blue,This is the best product since the internet- NO track ball to clean- no cords to mess with- cleans my desk up- Plus it allows you to surf the web without a distance restriction- A++- Thanks Microsoft!
1,Horribly Inaccurate,"i had been wanting to go wireless for a while, but i also wanted something optical. when i saw the MS had come up with an inexpensive solution, i jumped at the chance to try it.i'll cut to the chase. the mouse is extremely erratic. first, don't even think about using it with the ps/2 port--the mouse will hardly respond. it works far better on USB, but there's a significant lag that does not go over well if you need the mouse for anything requiring precision. i tried the mouse under a million different OS settings (winXP), changed the mousing surface, played with the receiver, swapped batteries---nothing improved the performance of the unit.basically, if you're a gamer or an artist, stay away. this mouse will frustrate the heck out of you. shame on microsoft for not testing this thing a little more."
2,decent mouse if you get one that isn't defective,"It has the great convenience of being wireless with good range. The battery life appears to be decent, approaching a month of hour a day usage. It is definitely not a mouse useable for gaming. It doesn't have the response nor the precision required. I would have given it 3 stars had it not stopped working."
1,"Was OK, now useless","Was using it with my Powerbook and it was OK. Unlike the other comments, I didn't find it to be jumpy at all however the accelleration could have been faster. Now 60+ days in the left button won't work. Tried new batteries, tried different PC. No dice. I have the full blown Explorer Mouse for a year now with no problems and have never killed a button on any mouse before. Now out of warranty and having tossed the box I'm out of luck. A lesson learned for cheaping out!"
1,Used it for 2 weeks and then it Died,"It was working fine for two weeks, and then dead. kaput. muerto. nothing I did could get it started. Should've read the other reviews. It seems it is a common problem. A waste of money."
4,Nice operation once you get used to it,"I have had my mouse for about 3 months. It used up the first set of batteries in about a month and started acting up. I replaced them with rechargeable alkaline and they seem to be better. Have had none of the problems others described, but I did NOT install the software. Am using Windows XP Pro and let it recognize the mouse automatically. The feel is a bit different than the older Microsoft ergonomic design, but it did not take me long to adjust to it. The whell has a very good feel to it; much better than older designs. The range of operation is over 3 feet. My base is behind my computer about 2.5 feet from the mouse. Overall, I like it quite a lot."
1,MOUSE DOESNT WORK,The first mouse that came simply did not work which I had to return to Amazon.com(which I will say was very accomodating). Then the second mouse worked well at first but then the batteries kept on giving out. I had to keep on moving the batteries to get the power going. I will return my second microsoft mouse and buy a logitech.
2,Massively annoying,"As I struggled using this microsoft mouse to make it here to write this review, I became more and more furious. I have had this mouse for 6 weeks or so. It wasn't long after buying the mouse that my double click with the left button started to cut out. Sometimes lasting 5 mins other times days. I have spent a few hours on Microsoft Tech support trying to fix it. It finally started working on its own. Today however it stopped working in the middle of a Photoshop project. Can any of you imagine working on a Photoshop project with a left mouse button cutting out? The only thing that kept me from finding out what the interior of this mouse looks like by utilizing a tool I call ""My living room wall"" is through repeating the serenity prayer while ocaasionally slamming the mouse down on my desk. This thing isn't getting any better for me. If you buy this mouse after I have written this, better check for new drivers or find your receipt."
1,This product needs some major work.,"This mouse worked just fine when I installed it, although its tracking wasn&#65533;t quite as precise as my corded trackball mouse. After four weeks of flawless cord-free use, the left button would not register a click and then a couple days later the right button ... out also. I tried replacing batteries, uninstalling/reinstalling the software, switching USB/PS2 ports, changing frequencies, etc. and it did not help fix any problems.It seems like Microsoft needs to take this product back to the testing labs and work out the bugs. I would suggest looking for a wireless mouse from a different company or wait to see if Microsoft comes out with a new updated product later in the year. My MS wireless mouse is heading back to the store where it came from."
2,"Good for office applications, lousy with games!","I think the title of my review says it all. I gave this mouse only 2 hours of use. It worked ok for using office applications like Excel or Word and fine on browsing the internet, but I was always left with the feeling it is slow and imprecise. When I tried it in Age of Mythology, it was downright too slow to work effectively. I could not click on my units as quickly as my regular Logitech Optical mouse, so I am returning MS' wireless blue mouse tomorrow. Note, I already upped the precision and mouse speed all the way to max, but it was still slow! I do not recommend this item as a gamer's mouse. Leave this to the internet surfers or business users!"
2,Do Not Buy If You Play Games!,"This mouse looks pretty cool. But, it lags and skips around sometimes which can be very annoying when precision is needed (ie. playing games) Even on the desktop, the cursor will sometimes skip totally across the screen while you are moving the mouse. It's not really smooth either...if u just look at the cursor, it looks like ur dragging the mouse across sandpaper."
2,Poor experience,"Personally, I had a bad experience with this product. Everything was great on the first day. The mouse was wonderfully ergonomic, the colour was awesome, it matched my mousepad and desktop beautifully. However, the second day, I noticed a few things that were contrary to what I expected. First of all, the mouse's range wasn't even nearly close to the advertised 6 feet. I found I couldn't use it beyond a maximum of 2 feet away from the receiver. This was when there was absolutely nothing between the mouse and the receiver. Never mind that, but I noticed that the left mouse button squeaked every time I pressed it. And this was on the second day after I bought it. I hadn't subjected the mouse to any impact whatsoever.Maybe this was just an isolated case, judging from all the reviews I read about it. However, due to my experience, I had no choice but to trade this model for a Logitech Wireless MouseMan Optical."
1,Steer clear,"This mouse worked well for the first couple of weeks. Then, I unable to bring up Windows on my computer (I have XP-Pro). Found out it was due to the mouse. IntelliPoint 4.1 software was uninstalled and reinstalled. Worked fine, for about 2 days. Now, everytime it locks me out of Windows, I have to shut down, unplug the mouse, start up, then plug mouse back in. Sometimes right button won't work. Not worth your money, trust me."
4,"""Countefifth Detective""-4 stars","In this fifth collection of the truly great ""100 Bullets"" comic, we are introduced to private eye Milo Garret, a man who recently got out of the hospital after going through the windshield of his car face first. Obivously, he doesn't look too good (he spends the majority of the story with his head in bandages) and is curious how he ended up the way he has. After meeting a man only known as Agent Graves (a constant character in the series)who gives him an opportunity to find out who is responsible for his string of bad luck and the chance to pay them back. But as he's about to find out, the truth of it all may just put him under permanently. The solid writing by Brian Azzarello and the vibrant art of Eduardo Risso continue to amaze me. While you may need to have read the previous volumes of the series to understand several minor plot points, it is still a solid read, with a truly dark, noir-ish ending that will leave you reeling. Recommended."
5,Great Band- Great Music!,"I purchased this after watching Fiction Plane rock a sold out show at the House of Blues in Dallas. The fans were diverse in age/ race, a testament to the universal appeal of the group.This music is fun. I highly recommend this album. The best $9.99 I have spent in years!"
5,Great sounds,"After hearing Fiction Plane open a concert before Fergie and The Police, I decided it would be a worthwhile purchase. The preview soundtracks from the album sounded good and upon delivery I wasn't disappointed. There's some similarity in sound to The Police (which I also really like) and overall it's a great listen, well worth it!!"
5,Saw them live last week!,"Awesome band, nice to have another alternative sound CD to my collection. They opened for The Police last week in Chicago, all together an awesome concert, I even got their autographs on my ticket stub after they performed! I hope they stick around for awhile!"
4,Crown and Anchor,"I enjoyed the intricate character desciptions and the way the author made you feel what the feeling. The plot of this book was not proped up by gratuitous sex and violence, instead the author used strong character developement and story line to envelope the reader."
5,Shirley's Personality Shines,This album is a must for Shirley MacLaine fans! Her sparkling personality shines through each song she sings and each monologue she shares with the audience. One can only wish this dynamic performance was available on video.In my mind's eye I can almost see Shirley dancing as she performs at the Palace.
3,Nice reinforcer toys,I purchased this to use as a reinforcer for my son.We have work sessions and he gets small reinforcers for doing his work.He was quite happy with this toy and picked it 8 out of 10 times for his reinforcer.
2,Get the right version,"Firstly a single edit of the title track is a bit of a rip off.If buying this cd, make sure its the UK version with the wounded buffalo mix which is the best mix there is of this song.The AUS version does not have this, instead has the Dlugosch mix and dub, where the dub is just an instrumental of the mix cd... lame. The Dlugosch mix isnt too bad, very disco.The Bob Sinclair mix is OK, a bit long overall."
1,no buy for this album,save your money.only 2 tracks worth listening to... ie. lovesorrow and de santiago.the instrumentation for those 2 tracks could've been a lot more emotive if the arrangements werent so plain.as for the fast tracks... nothing groundbreaking from this guitar player who was groundbreaking back in the early 80s. some of the tracks sound like he's playing catch up with nu metal.save your money for something better... oh and with regards to the new album - loudspeaker... DISMAL.
2,A disappointment,"When I found out that Friedman was coming out with a new album, I couldn't wait for it to arrive in stores. Then when I got it, I was let down. It is pretty bland and there is nothing new or inspiring on this album. Im losing interest fast in instrumental ""virtuoso"" music, and this album is not helping. If you dont have any Friedman albums, buy ""Dragons Kiss"" for insane shred or ""Introduction"" for really beautiful music. Those two albums are very good. But this one is just not that good. The sticker on the cd says ""this is his best playing to date!!!"" but dont let that self-advertising fool you. If you are looking for something new and exciting in ""virtuoso"" music, DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM. The only new and exciting album in this genre is ""Crystal Planet"" by Satriani. That album is so FRESH. Final Thought: If you want ""music for speeding,"" buy The Golden Age of Grotesque by Marilyn Manson. You can definitely speed to that album."
2,Music for falling asleep to.,"I cannnot agree with some of these reviews. This album is yet another regurgitation of the fabulous 80's shred days. If I want to speed to music I'd listen to up to date thrash. This album just puts me to sleep. It's boring and unoriginal and nowadays Marty's music just sounds the same to me. If you like Marty Friedman, get some Megadeath or his work with Jason Becker. But ontherwise I'd avoid this because there just ain't anything mouth opening on it."
5,awesome!,"when i read some review that said this album will contain some industrial and techno stuff i'm a bit disappointed but after bought it and listen it one time i already like it. no there's no industrial or techno sounds on this album. it has some but only at a noise on the begining of the songs but when the songs start it's all normal. this album is just like other marty's album songs like novocaine kiss,love sorrow,corazon de santiago and lust for life will remains you of ""scenes"" and ""introduction"" melodic guitar work. songs like fuel injection and gimme a dose will remains his work with megadeth that is metal & hardrockso basiccally if you like the other marty solo album you'll have no problem with his onei like nearly all the track. the 1st track gimme a dose really rocks!"
4,ZoOm zOoM ZoOm,"When Marty Friedman left Megadeth, it was always thought to be that the reason he left the fastest contemoprary thrash metal of this time was that he had wanted to experiment with classic melodies. This album completely blows that idea away. Marty, not only, lets lose, he brings life to a dying genre. His guitars are crisp, inexplicably fast and just puts everyone eating his dust by the end.Compared to his old albums where he is more attuned to classic tunes and guitars, Marty makes this album his fastest since his first solo album and his work with Megadeth. He still holds the record of being the most melodic guitarist, that can shift from one form to the other. When he has his way, he can take you on an adventure with catchy speeds.Now that Megadeth has been out of commission for some time, Marty Friedman has the last laugh by sticking to his roots and yet explores with new out takes.Recommended."
1,Worst textbook that I have ever had in my College life,"This book is the worst book that my professor has ever chose for my math class. The definitions and theorems in this book has lack of explanations, and there are very few examples. But also the solutions of the examples doesn't make sense at all(especially on chapter 3). I want to tell my professor not to get this book for students in future. I really hate this book."
5,Goes together easily and cooks excellent,"Upon getting my grill delivered to my door, I was able to assemble this high quality grill in an hour and 10 minutes! The grill is extremely well made, appears to be very durable, and has several features that demonstrate that Weber is clearly putting resources into both R&D.My first meal was great and went off without a hitch. Zero flareups as advertised even though I made 100% beef burgers. Very happy and would recommend this grill...."
5,Great small griller,I love this small grill. It is perfect when I am cooking for one or two and don't want to use up a ton of charcoal in my big weber grill. It gives quite a bit of cooking area compared to other mini grills and is deep enough to provide a good fire (some other small grills are so shallow you cannot get a decent fire without burning things up).I am also very lame at putting things together but this was a snap.
3,works but could be better,Was interested in this model due to it's legs folding up for easy transport. Alas mine must not have been made correctly since the grill rack does not fit in the grill quite right. I have to really push it down or pry it on which needless to say makes things difficult logistically for lighting the charcoal before you put the rack on. Would probably go with a different model if could do over.
3,"Not bad, but not outstanding either","It does the job, but as one reviewer said, it doesn't get very, very hot. Hot enough to cook meat well - yes, but the hamburgers don't have a terrific taste, just an average + ordinary taste. This would all be fine if I only paid $24.99 for it, but I paid $49.99. It is well made of good materials, but honestly, I don't see where it's much different from what they're selling at Wal-Mart for thirtysomething dollars or less."
5,Easy as pie,"We have moved into a new house and will probably buy a gas grill next year. For this summer I though it would be good to have a small grill. I chose the go-anywhere grill because I always liked weber products. This grill is great.First, it's great to use real charcoal. It absolutely tastes better. And the grill uses a lot less coal then you would think. It's easy and fast to light the coal - and cooks just great.Even after I buy a new grill, I'm sure I'll keep using this grill for fish and other things - just for the taste."
5,a portable workhorse,"We were so happy with this grill that we purchased a second one! We camp as part of a large group, and when both of these are in use you can grill for a crowd, fast! The grill is easy to clean, and very compact---it fits in the space right behind either of our front car seats. Very charcoal efficient too."
4,A good buy,Have used it once and am very satisfied. Will use an aluminum foil liner next time. Hopefully it will make up cleaning ashes easier.
4,"Easy Setup, Easy Clean Up, Easy Travel","Easy SetupI put it together in a few minutes and used it right away.Easy Clean UpI keep mine pretty clean between uses. It's easy to wipe out with paper towels. It even fits in the sink if you really want to clean it.Easy TravelOnce it cools off, you just flip the legs up and they lock fit into a groove on the lid, so carrying it is pretty straight forward. Lightweight.Not Many NegativesThe only downside so far is that you have to put it on a flat surface that can stand the heat (like a picnic table). I've grilled on the beach where we put in right the sand but you'll need the wind to cooperate for that!"
4,My new go grill,"This review is for Weber 121020 Go-Anywhere Charcoal Grill .Used it for patio/deck/camping barbecue.Assembly is simple(SAR).It toook me 5-6 min to fully assemble this.It is big enough for family of four for light grilling.Although my thought on paying 50$ for a boxed metal sheet too much but then the quality on this is good if not the best.Hope I will get few years out of it.I highly recommend some cover or atleast a plastic bag over it ,if you are planning to leave it on deck/patio.Also highly recommended is a small/medium grill cleaner.To protect the base cover it with aluminum foil so that you dont have to clean up the mess falling from the grill.There is a little heat transfer to the bottom so a wooden plank or a flat stone is recommended for those expensive decks just to be safe."
5,Perfect!!!!!!!!!!!,It was exactly what we were looking for in a grill. Does a great job. Couldn't be happier with the grill.
4,Grillin' Guy,"Love the grill. However there are a few things that I feel could be changed to make it a five star grill.It desperately needs some way to deal with the lid. As of now, you need a hand to hold the lid while doing anything on the grill. Some type of hinge, or hooks would really be nice to free up a hand because I am using the grill on my patio, and have to remove the lid and set it in the deck (which involves rolling back a piece of rug that is on my deck) usually with what I am going to cook in my other hand. That and the shallowness of the grill keeps the food pretty close to the coals, buy it is supposed to be a portable grill and not much can be done about that.When I was assembling the grill, and of the end handles was welded on wrong, so I had to cut down the inside plastic handle piece to make it fit, because the handle was pinched together a bit then welded.I will still cook only on Weber grills, and will be buying a larger one when space and money allows."
3,"Love the simple design, but handles were bent......","and when I straightened them, the porcelain chipped off on the inside of grill.It is the perfect size for on the road, or around the house when you don't want to use your larger grill. Especially when it is mostly my wife and myself that will be using it.It should still last a couple of years. But just a bit disappointed. I would have given it a five but for the handles/porcelain."
4,Great Little Grill!,"Bought this for my husband about 2 years ago (I'm slow on the reviews). We are still using it! We keep it out in our shed. So it's not exactly sitting out in the rain or snow, but it is outdoors. However, it is still kicking and we love it. We have a larger gas grill, so I wanted something with charcoal. We use it at home and it's also been to MANY sporting events. Love how small and easy it is to use and clean. Would definitely buy this again."
5,Excellent Product,This portable grill is excellent! The size is ideal and the design is very well thought out. It definitely was a great purchase.
3,Not The Best Not The Worst,We read all the reviews prior to purchasing this model. The reviews said that this doesn't burn hot enough unless you over stack the charcoal. Ok we figured we could deal with that. Well it isn't that ok. It causes a very large fire. Too large for the little grill to handle. The plastic handles melted the first time we used it. Once it burns down its fine and grills great but it doesn't grill well if you use a smaller amount of charcoal. The bottom is too shallow to hold the amount of charcoal you really need. The portability was great. The legs flip up and lock the lid on which kept our car from becoming a charcoal mess when we went home. Grilling surface was good we were able to fit 8-10 kabobs and a whole pack of hot dogs (not at the same time.) This would be a 4 or 5 star grill if it weren't for the charcoal issue.
4,Single Mans Grill,The grill is every thing advertised. The grill is great for a one or two person meal. Hard to put four rib eye steaks on but was able to do so. Good point is it cooked evenly and is very easy to clean up. I use aluminum foil to line the bottom and with its side vents does not effect the cooking process. When finished and cool I just pull the foil up and give is a quick wipe. It meets my needs and is worth the money.
4,Charcoalishous: Just the 2 of us,It's only the 2 of us. This is the perfect size for small meals. The heat control on this grille is excellent. The product was very easy to put together. It took me 20 minutes to unpack and assemble. The only caution is that you can choke your grill off if you are not careful with adjustments so you need some experience with the grill before you try to impress. Thumbs up for a party of 2 to 4 people.
3,sharks and lions,"some scenes are pretty gross and therefore are not for kids. the filmmaker did not spend much time on his subjects ( this film only covers a week of event for this particular pride ). although he gives a viewer some background for hs subject, yet he does not help his audience to form some emotion bond or investment on the lions."
4,Overall good book with lots of info.,"Like I said... overall very good with LOTS of information.Only bad because I felt some things were not definative enough.(The iguana is nasty because of its home or food or lights or people, or too much attention, not enough attention, or its shedding or its ""close"" to shedding or its ""close"" to its breeding season or it is summer or your altitude or the alignment of the moon, etc..Unfotunately many things regarding these animals can be caused by a host of different things. Therefore, the book couldnt really help in this area."
5,Green Iguana: The Ultimate Owner's Manual,"This book has excellent sections on feeding and heating and lighting. There is also good advice within the taming and training sections. The book contains many quotes from other iguana owners, therefore the author is not the only source of information. I found this book to be very enlighting and I refer to it often. I would recommened it to anyone even considering getting an iguana. It was so helpful that I told my vet about it, the pet store, and even a stranger I met in the reptile section of the pet store. This book is a wealth of knowledge in an area of information previously not advailable to the common iguana pet owner."
5,THE BEST IGUANA BOOK EVER!!! NOTHING ELSE COMPARES!!!,"This book offers everything this is to know about iguanas. I had an iguana for two years and I wanted to read up on some more information, and this book HELPED me on so many things. I MEAN EVERYTHING YOU WANT TO KNOW, IS IN THIS BOOK!!! I thought I knew everything, and was a iguana expert, but when I read this book I was so wrong. This book is easy to read for anyone, and he breaks it down to you what exatly you need to take care of your iguana. No matter how long you had an iguana, or if you are thinking of getting one, YOU NEED TO GET THIS BOOK!!!"
5,A bible for Iguana owners,"Hatfield's book is the product of intense and painstaking research. It reads like a novel and is gripping even if you don't own an Iguana. No question goes unanswered, and it makes other herp books seem like they were written for children. Definately the definative treatise on the Green Iguana. Features great testimonials from a broad cross section of Iguana keepers from across the country. Don't miss this one!"
5,Awesome - storyteller.,I would say he is an awesome storyteller. Maybe comes from his stay in Ireland. I love this CD. He fits right up there with Bruce Springstein and James Taylor. Kind of folkish but with a modern day twist. You will love it.
5,Good in every way,"I like Josh Ritter's voice, I like the tunes he crafts, I like the intelligence and poetry of his lyrics, I like the way he assembles the sounds on this album. I like the delicate yet robust production. There are jangly songs and sparse, quiet songs; there's the thought provoking and the humorous.There's everything you could want from a record.Little wonder that everybody's giving it five stars."
5,Beautiful book with several fold-outs,I am a big fan of Yvonne Jacquette and have several books about her work. This one has lots of decent repro's - not the best quality but also not the highest price book. I particularly like the fold-outs since they let you see some big landscape-style works. I am not commenting on the commentary since my interest is in seeing the work.
5,Great!,"With my last pregnancy I had to take Flintstone vitamins because I could not stomach the prenatals. While trying to conceive our second child, I started experimenting with different vitamins. I'm now pregnant and this is the only vitamin I've found to be easy on the stomach--no nausea, no burping, no diarrhea. I highly recommend it."
5,2nd prenancy,Very good all natural vitamins. No belching or after taste like I had with other vitamins. Do not make queasy if taken without food.
2,"Nice system, until it breaks ...","I purchased this unit back in October, 2007. It worked great from the start, but I found myself wishing I'd bought something with a BPM counter. Unfortunately, the left CD player stopped working in less than 2 months, with no more than 10 hours of use. The CD player might have had 2 hours of use - I hooked up two turntables and used those more, anyway.In January, 2008, I sent the unit to Gemini for repair. I received a call back from an employee who gave me no information except for his first name, phone #, and an incorrect extension. After a couple of weeks, I finally got in touch with him, and the repair will cost $190. Apparently, it was damaged in shipping, as well.I'm going to spend the extra money and buy a separate mixing board / cd player configuration."
2,cdm 500,i purchsed this item in 2007 and after two months the lights on the left side went off.after a couple months the pitch controller on both sides stopped working. i regretted i bought this cd player.the only good thing about it is that it has two external input.
2,Sparse Great Songs,"Some of the pieces on the first cd are ""take away"" great.The secound cd is ...I enjoy ""world culture"" music and sound however, the secound cd in this double collection was a monotonous let down."
4,Be a Marco Polo of music,"Its rather difficult to review this in the regular like it/don't like it way. This is the endemic music of the people along the silk road the runs across Asia. Some of it sounds very strange compared to Western music, like study for an Anthropology course, while some of it very enjoyable."
5,Enjoyable for all ages!,Great story! It is full of fun and excitement! It leaves you wanting more. We can not wait to read the next one!!!!
2,DeWalt HVAC Technician Certification Exam Guide,"This book is a convenient way to practice exam questions but is limited in the number of questions. It has no references to help you understand the questions (ie formulas or calculations). The CD provided with the book for practice exams has several errors. For instance, there was one question with the exact same answer for two of the choices. There were two questions that left out pertinent information needed to calc the answer. One of the questions, (#46 math)did not even ask you a question to answer.DEWALT HVAC Technician Certification Exam Guide"
3,It's OK,"I was looking for a pillow exactly like the one that I have (its the same brand, but doesn't have the egg-crate bottom). I received mine as a gift. This one is smaller and not as soft as the one I have. In fact its not very soft at all. I got it for my husband cause he was always trying to steal mine. He likes it ok, but still tries to take my pillow sometimes. I would love to find one that is bigger and softer like the one I already have."
1,Leather Forever?,This DVD is terrible she should of stuck to basics and not have back up singers and trumpets I actually turned if off half way through.I would rather see a DVD of all her video clips right from the start of her career.
2,This is really bad,"The DVD is terrible. Too bad because Suzi is the best. This just don't show it. All the horns is destroying it. Her voise is tired and the whole show is on auto pilot.Get the Live in Japan DVD from 1975. Then you see what i'm talking about. Suzi should really lose the horns and all the brass. She's much better without it.Too bad she never will make a good DVD that shows how good she really is.This will disappoint you.Sorry to say it, but this is terrible."
3,Leather Forever,"The DVD was a birthday present with the recipient really enjoying Suzie, she is a huge fan of hers. The DVD had all of the songs she enjoys and has already played it numerous times.There is a lack of Suzie DVD's so it was good to be able to purchase this through Amazon.I also find the entire ordering process easy and deliver to New Zealand was quick and efficient."
3,details about the dvd,"The Wild OneRock HardTear Me ApartShe's in Love with YouStumblin' In48 CrashGlycerine QueenCan the CanDevil Gate DriveIf You Can't Give Me LoveSpecial Features:Rare Home Movies; Vintage Music Videos, plus; Behind-the-Scenes Footage from the upcoming Documentary Film about Suzi#s amazing life; Naked Under Leather!Bonus Music Video for ""Why Do Rainbows Die?""aprox. 47 minutes"
5,A Book with Everything,"I have used this book in my classroom many times, from a read-aloud to the class to using it in small groups. There is some difficult vocabulary, but with help from a teacher or a parent, it is very much worthwhile. Children can relate to the mischievous, daredevil ways of the characters. It is both funny and heart-wrenching. The ending is always a struggle for me to read aloud to them. It always brings a tear to my eye. My classes have all loved it so much that they insist that I read the companion book Dear Levi, but I don't have it. I will be ordering it soon since my class keeps asking."
2,Weber Gas Grill,We bought this grill because of the large cooking surface space but were dismayed when the electric ignition switch was broken within about a month. We are currently having problems getting a replacement switch.
5,michelle shocked delivers!,"It has been quite a while since Michelle Shocked has put out a record so I was very anxious to hear this one. I wasn't disappointed!!This is an innovative, diverse record that perfectly reflects Michelle's genre-crossing sensibilities. From rockin' bluesy numbers like ""What Can I Say"" and ""Little Billie"" to gorgeous acoustic numbers like ""Moanin' Dove"" to songs like ""That's So Amazing"" and ""Go In Peace"" that evoke Van Morrison without really trying to (if that makes any sense), this is an amazing record. The production mixes dub sensibilities with steel guitar on some tracks, on others it is more straight ahead rockin'. It's hard to describe really, but very easy to listen to . The second disc is definitley a more ""chill"" experience, but a great companion to the first disc. This is one of the most consistently interesting and affecting records I have heard this year. Amazing!"
5,Super 'Natural' Recording,"For Michelle Shocked fans, there's no need to explain how truly remarkable this album, and artist, is. This review is for everyone else.Deep Natural simply can't be compared to early Michelle Shocked albums. For Michelle, each album is an opportunity to break new ground. As she put it at a recent show, ""its nice to go home and visit the room where you slept, but you wouldn't want to sleep in the same bed for the rest of your life."" No danger of that with Deep Natural.This is an album has a unique joyous, even spiritual tone that grows with each listen. Recorded by anyone else, Deep Natural could have been a too-preachy recording bent on spreading the gospel to non-believers. But with Michelle's optimistic and deft touch, it is an uplifting, transforming effort that will bring a smile to even a confirmed cynic. Buy this CD and songs like House Burning Down will keep you rocking, while Joy, That's So Amazing, and Forgive to Forget may change your outlook on life."
3,"Jesus says: Stop singing about me, I'm just one person","There's a lot of Jesus here. It's sort of off putting, especially to her god optional jewish fans. While I say, you love Jesus right on, in these heady days of UNDER GOD all religous dogma has started giving me the willies. Having said that, I listened to it RELIGIOUSLY for awhile and then it just stopped being something I wanted to listen to. I have yet to hear the 2nd disk and I've had the cd for months."
1,Disappointment,"I really liked her album ""Short Sharp Shocked"" and still do, but this one was a waste of money. I listened to it twice and probably will never again. Her religious and ""preachy"" fanatical overtones are annoying. There is not much more to say."
4,"Shocked stays on my ""just buy it"" list with this album.","When Michelle Shocked puts out an album, I buy it. It's a very short list of musicians I do this for.But a couple of albums ago, she seemed to be getting in a rut and I was thinking of taking her off my ""just buy it"" list. I'm glad I didn't.She's out of the rut and doing well.I love this album! The two-disk, two-hour format suits her well. It's like she takes you on an audible journey all over her talented landscape. Not many artists could pull that off.It seems like Shocked has settled into semi-obscurity and is comfortable with her current status. It has allows her to forget about pop sensibilities and just enjoy creating music, that often doesn't fit neatly in a category. At times she is rock and roll, folksy, bluesy and, in this album, gives us some R&B."
3,Sound and fury for small acceleration gain.,"I bought this intake at a great price after researching it on K&N;'s website and reading the installation sheet thoroughly to make sure it would be something I wanted to to and could do.The big thing that most people will have to do with this particular application is drill a 1.25"" hole into the tube. Not exactly what most people think they'll have to do. It wasn't that bad but it was a little unnerving considering if I screwed it up, there goes the whole project. You have to cut the vent tube prior to this, so after that, you ARE committed without having to buy replacement hose(s).Other than the above, installation was easy, if not tedious due to following all 22 steps, in order.Make sure to re-tighten all fittings after your road test, and re-check them again after the first day of driving."
3,Nice sounding intake,"Although they say it improves horsepower and gas mileage, I unfourtunately haven't noticed either. The sound of the intake is great. It sounds like a deap roar when the accelerator is pressed firm. The intake doesn't seem more powerful though. It may show up on a dyno, but I don't notice it. Might be better off just buying a K&N filter and saving a little money."
1,worthless sealer,"The foam falls off when you touch it! I needed caulk to seal some small areas on the inside of our kitchen cabinets. My husband brought this stuff home. The foam comes out so thick in width and you can't control where it should seal. After it dries and you touch it, it falls off - it never hardens. I wasted so much time, trying to fill small gaps in the wood."
4,easy to use,"great, easy to use, application. seals like a charm. deflates when hot, so be careful to reapply in such instances."
1,Dead on arrival,"I attempted to discharge the can and it refused to spray. I warmed up the can (to room temp) and it didn't help. From now on, I think I'll just go with the big box spray as they always seem to work."
3,Wonderful product! (While it lasted),"This is a really nice VCR. It's attractive looking and I have always really liked Sony products. You can use this to hook into the old caoxial cable systems. That was a really hard feature to find.Highly recommended.**Edit**This VCR worked great for about a year, then the sound went out, and the picture went black and white. Of course the warranty from Sony was past, and it would cost more to send it to them to fix it than it would to just get a new one. We don't know what happened. It wasn't the TV, it has been hooked up to more than one. We have tried to get it fixed, but so few places fix VCR's any more that it's virtually impossible. One of the VCR guys just gave us a cleaning tape, as if we hadn't tried that. Sadly, we are out $100 some bucks on this one."
2,Didn't last a year,"I have this vcr and the automatical tracking has stopped working. It still records but won't even track the tapes freshly recorded on it. I have to use a second vcr to play back the tapes that I tape on this one. Tried using a head cleaner and that didn't help. Also, as time went by the flash rewind didn't work at well either. Power outages mean setting all the times, the channel 3 or 4, auto off, clock, etc all over again, even if the lights in the house just blink for 1/2 second. It is a piece of junk."
3,Jumpy play back of recorded programs,"After 9 months, recorded programs on this VCR were jumpy (vertically unstable). Since it was within 1 year I was eligible for a $30 refurbished unit if I returned my defective unit at my own cost ($10 with UPS). At litle over three months later the refurbished unit had the same problem (I missed the 90 day warranty period by 1 week so was faced with the same $30 exchange program). I declined the exchange program this time because I do not trust this VCR will not have the same problem, again."
2,Not very impressed!,Poor image quality. Lack of features. Unfortunately not that many options out there.Ordered because of the Sony name.
2,"OK for SP, but unwatchable in EP","My main disappointment with this machine is that it won't play back tapes in the EP (6-hour) speed. The playback is jumpy to the point of being unwatchable (oddly, you can record tapes in EP on this machine and they will play back OK on other machines. I'm not sure what the problem is). Another annoyance is that when you fast-forward (e.g. to skip commercials), it tends to overshoot when you resume normal speed, causing you to miss about 15 seconds of the program unless you back up again... vexing! One good thing about the machine is that tape rewinding is blazingly fast."
5,Sony 4 head Hi Fi VCR,"The Sony SLV-N750 Full Chassis 4 head HI FI VCR is a wonderfully smooth functioning machine. Sony's excellent engineering has come through once again. For someone like me who still has many Video cassetts, I needed a replacement for my old machine that stopped working. No-one sells VCRs on the retail side anymore as it is 'old technology' so I was greatful to get one of the last refurbished machines that just 5 years ago were everywhere."
2,Very very disappointed,"This unit really is disappointing. It has easy set-up and decent features, but the sound and picture quality are very bad. Audio playback is noticeably muted. I had been using a Samsung for 12 years and would continue using that same unit today if not for the fact I had to open it all open it all up to retrieve a snagged tape - and then never got it back together right. So I thought, well it is time for a new VCR anyways. I have always liked Sony equipment - TVs, CD players etc. However the images on this one are just plain bad - even on the best tape speed. You can not see details on people's faces, colors wash together and there is a lot of noise on screen. Compared this unit right next to a friend's old Funai and theirs is so much better. Went back and forth hoping that maybe it was my set-up. But in recording and playback, this Sony really stunk. I am returning mine and looking for something else. Oh, if I could only have back my old VCR!"
1,Expected more from Sony.,"I knew my expectations shouldn't be set that high for a lower priced VCR, but the poor playback quality and even poorer recording quality was way below my already low expectations. I tried several different combination of VHS tapes and recording speeds, including premium high grade tapes, but got the same poor results from recordings; fuzzy, blurred, dark, and even audio was sub-par. Playback of retail tapes while not as bad as the ones I recorded were the worst I have seen from any VCR. I thought perhaps the unit had a factory defect, but upon reading these other reviews I see that it is most likely not the case. The other complaint I have of this unit is the rewind and forward mode is very annoyingly loud. It also lacks VRC+ and s-video input/outputs. I really expected more from Sony. I am returning this unit pronto and doing my homework before purchasing another VCR."
1,The unit don't work after 3 months,"I can't believe this.I put a movie and I getno image and no sound, just a noise screen.Then I put a VCR Head Cleaner Cassette to fix the situation,but nothing, unit is broken."
2,"fast delivery, so-so product","The VCR arrived promptly, but there was an eaten up cassette tape stuck in the VCR, and I had to force it out with a butter knife and a pair of pliers. The tape was completely unwound and wrapped up around the VCR heads. The VCR works okay now, but it is dented and scratched up pretty bad like it was abused pretty bad. I am surprised that they rated it in ""good"" condition with it like that. Overall, I felt I paid a bit too much for a VCR that was in that rough of condition."
2,Four years old and eating tapes,"We purchased this VCR for $79.99 on 5/30/04 and are trashing it today because it starting destroying tapes. I fails to release the actual tape portion of the cassette on eject, shredding the tape. BEWARE anyone using this for home viewing home videos with cassette adapters! We purchased a different Sony VCR two years earlier and it is still working."
1,Record speed lacking,If you read this is an SP/LP/SLP recorder don't believe it..I wanted the 3 recording speeds..I could have got a 2 speed recorder at Wal-Mart for half the price...
1,Worst VCR,"This has got to be the worst VCR sony has.... The audio portion of this VCR is it's biggest downfall but the video section isn't much better...My advise-- by an Emerson or something cheaper, it has to be better than this......"
4,Satisfied,This was the second VCR of the same model I have purchased as it has all the features that I like. The first one stopped working after 2 years but I liked it enough to purchase a second one.
1,Sony has lost their quality,"I am on my second VCR of this same model and am going to return it for a different brand, don't waste your money on this machine. It cannot record or play tapes correctly, my old Magnavox that was falling apart did better than this one."
1,a sony slv-n750 full chassis 4 head HI-FI VCR,"THIS VCR ONLY WORKED FOR A DAY OR TWO. THEN THERE WAS NO SOUND WHEN IT RECORDED MY SOAP OPERA'S.I WAS FURIOUS. IT IS NO FUN TO LOOK AT A PROGRAM THAT HAS NO SOUND. YOU PEOPLE THAT KEEP UP WITH THE SOAP OPERAS......YOU BE MAD TOO. I HAVE PUT IN A WRITTEN COMPLAINT TO AMAZON SINCE THEY SOLD ME THE ITEM.TO DATE I HAVE YET TO GET AN ANSWER FROM THEM. MY HOPE IS THAT THEY ASSUME THE RESPONSABILITY OF THE MATTERAND SOLVE MY PROBLEM. I DIDN'T MIND PAYING A HIGH PRICE FOR THE ITEM, SINCE I NOW ITS HARD TO GET A VCR NOW DAYS. THE ONLY USE I GOT FROM THIS ITEM WAS TO WATCH MY OLD TAPES WHICH HAD VOICE IN THEM. I NEED A VCR THAT RECORDS GOOD. I NEED TO TAPE MY SOAP OPERAS OFCOURSE WITH SOUND IN THEM."
2,Get an extended warrenty,Sony has decreased its quality on their VCRs. The video is about average for an inexpensive machine. The sound on this unit is poor in quality and sometimes does not record at all.I have two other VCRs that I use. One is a sony and one is a Hitachi. You cannot record on the sony and playback on the other sony. There is no way to correct the tracking on either machine.
2,Still Sweating,"Granted... my bedroom is the hottest and least ventilated in the house and the humidity can be bad at times, but this device definitely does not cool the (rather small) space 12 degrees. Three to five degrees would be a better estimate. In retrospect, I'd have rather spent more on a real portable ac unit, which I now will probably purchase anyway.PS: the water indicator is definitely difficult to read and a flashlight is typically necessary."
3,Swamp cooler,"We got this unit to replace a larger one that wore out. It does a fair job of cooling our bed area especially with ice. It has lots of nice features such as a remote control and an ionizer air cleaner. A timer and sleep modes are really great.Two short comings though are a fill access cover that won't stay open making filling it a three hand job. Also the water level indicator is difficult to read, we have to keep a flashlight handy to read it.Still a pretty good deal at the price!"
1,Dont waster your time,"For those of you who are looking at the price of this item and are assuming it is a great price for what this item states it can do, dont fool yourself. I purchased this item and was very excited being that it was my first air cooler and was happy to finally have something to cool my room I was very disappointed. First I tried it with just the ice water. Then I tried it with the cold packs on top but inste4ad it still kept shotting out this funny smelling air. I left to the store and closed the window and the door in my room and when I came back my room felt like there was this icky feel to the air. I was very unssatisfied. Please dont waste your time."
2,Little information.,"I've read dozens of books for promotional exams, but this has to be one of the worst I've seen. Not a good read. Lots of vagueness, and I simply don't like his writing style. Unless this is required reading, you'd gain a lot more from something like Norman's Fire Officer's Handbook of Tactics."
1,Dissatisfied Custormer,"I ordered a 11x14 binder, and the one sent to me was an 8x11 binder. I am still trying to return it."
2,Not much in here for me,Rather psycological in my view. Gleaned a few points but...that was about it. Almost better to figure it out yourself or talk with a friend who is like you.
2,sometimes useful,"This is a somewhat useful book for those who accept the highly- sensitive-person designation. Ms. Jaeger provides some helpful advice, though a fair bit is so general as to render it almost useless. Also, I think even she is aware that there are many cases in which people with family obligations simply cannot afford to leave dull, menial, and wearisome jobs, however soul-destroying such work might be. Ms. Jaeger's book deserved a much more careful editing. It is full of grammatical errors, most glaringly--pronoun-reference problems and needless repetition, which frequently obstruct the message. I appreciate the efforts of the author to tackle the subject, but the book ought to have been much shorter and more finely-tuned. A good editor should have assisted her with this."
2,Less than expected,I purchased the Smokey Joe as a camping/alternative grill. I have been disappointed in its' performance. It is very difficult to get a good coal bed established! It appears that there is not enough ventilation from the bottom to allow sufficient air to the coals. It is very difficult to get the charcoal hot enough to grill steaks/hamburgs/hotdogs. I would not buy another
5,Very happy!,"Purchased this as a gift for my boyfriend, he was thrilled. It's a fantastic little grill, perfect for a small deck or if you don't chargrill often. Would definitely recommend!"
5,sweet,"Nothing better than a Weber, grew up with that product it's what my dad used when I was 9 yrs old I'm in my 40's now. So out of habit when I saw that it was portable just had to have it. I used it on camping trip, which is why I bought it and as always awesome! And you have to love the warranty not that you'll use it but that shows their confidence in Weber."
5,my second one,"After 19 years our 'lil Smokey Joe had seen it's better days. We purchased this grill as a last minute decision for use at a music festival. It just happened to be the one available at my local hardware store. It soon turned out to be our primary grill and went with us everywhere.Weber makes a great grill and this is a great design. I've read the reviews about how it doesn't draft or other complaints...I don't know what they are talking about. It has three places to allow airflow through the sides and lid. Also the bar that locks the lid locks into another bar in the back so that you can set the lid at any angle, helps keep down flair-ups and controls the temperature.Its small size is still able to accommodate enough food for up to six persons.I give this grill two thumbs up, you just have to learn how to use it!"
1,Can't Cook on Cold Coals!,"I love Webber and I purchased this little Smokey Joe because I have been so happy. It it built very well and looks good too but this little gye has a MAJOR design flaw!! The vents on the bottom of the unit are too small! If you cook with the lid on and all vents open (max air flow possible) your charcoal will be cold and nearly out in 20 minutes and your chicken or whatever will be uncooked. Now the fun begins. Take everything out, blow compressed air on the coals to get them going or add more lighter fluid... It's a matter of air flow being adequate to keep the coals hot. I plan on drilling more holes but rust will limit it's life. Maybe I will complain to Weber?"
4,Needs more charcoal,"Nice little grill. Cooked one dozen chicken thighs. Used 30 briquettes, per Weber manual, and allowed the flames to rise and sear before covering (coals white). Took one hour and the coals seemed to peak early. Could not get flames to flare up half way through. My experience with larger Weber grills (same coals, same chicken, 45 minutes) suggests more coals are needed here.However, the residual heat was adequate and the longer cooking time rendered a suculent result.Nothing wrong with that."
4,"Awesome,Easy nice small grill","This grilled works like how you would want a grill to work, i even cooked with it in the cold out side J FRESCO said"
4,Great small charcoal,"I went through all the Internet trying to select the best portable charcoal. I finally selected this one over the silver smokey joe. From the experience I had with it, I have to admit that with the lid closed, there is no way you can keep on having a fire alive for more than a few minutes. When the lid is open though, you will have a great fire. So I only use it that way.The portability is perfect. You close the lid and you get away with it, then forget it. It looks all clean from the outside, no crap going out nothing."
4,Review of Smokey Joe Gold Charcoal Grill,"Great item , easy to assemble and use. Locking cover is priceless for portability."
3,smokey joe grill,It is a nice looking & well made grill. I thought it did make alot of smoke. Not sure if it was my husbands fire starter or because grill is on the small side. Burgers came out good though.
2,Shipping Limbo,"When you charge my credit card, you need to ship the item. It is improper to charge my credit card prior to shipping an item. You put me in limbo not being able to alter change or cancel and order for more than 3 days after ordering and then extending the shipping time to an unacceptable time frame order 16 July not getting until 5 August? Weber 40020 Smokey Joe Gold Charcoal Grill"""
5,Great little grill,"My husband and I couldn't make up our minds on whether we should buy charcoal or gas. So I bought the smokey joe as a temporary solution while we decide. We love this grill. It's perfect for one or two people. The ""gold"" edition is perfect for taking it on the go."
5,cooked 4 tray of drumsticks perfectly,let me tell you this bad boy is great. i was able to cook 4 tray of drumstick perfectly.must have grill.
1,Poor heat; coals go out because no air flow from bottom up,I've used this grill twice now and what a total waste of time. I totally agree with the person who said the coals keep going out because there is no air flow under the coals. The food stops cooking and you have to relight the coals. I just saw one by Char-Broil at Lowe's for $30 that I plan on buying after work. That grill has a venting system (not just a louver) positioned in a separate cavity under the grill that draws air from the sides of the cavity and then up towards the charcoal.
1,"Weber fan, but this is not their best work. Design Flaw (SJ Gold)","I'm a long time Weber fan and love the majority of their products. I've had a number of their charcoal grills over the years and figured the Smokey Joe GOLD would be a nice little addition for balcony and picnic grilling. Unfortunately, Weber designed this grill with an inherent flaw. Unlike their other charcoal grills, the air inlet vents are above and to the sides of the coals rather than below them. When you place the lid on the grill (as Weber encourages all customers to do in all of their literature/instructions), the coals cool and go out rather than cook the food. To use this grill, I've had to make it a 'lidless' cooker and never use the lid. I may try the SJ Silver or the Go-Anywhere as both of these grills have the air inlets below the coals and shouldn't have this same problem."
3,Smokey Joe so .....why'd they change it??,"I'd had a Smokey Joe at home in Australia since 1998. It has performed admirably and without a hitch. More than once it has made me look like a culinary genius.So I bought one to use at my In-laws so I could wow them with my extensive skills whilst visiting them in the USA.I was a little curious when the new SJ arrived and there had been a design departure from the original. To wit, the bottom adjustable vents were gone and replaced by side adjustable vents. They just don't seem to do the job as well. Couldn't seem to get the same control nor get the same heat into it. I tried a few different fuels and same result. I used to be able to use lump charcol in my original SJ...no chance on this one........and whats with the bloody plastic handle?? You can't pick the lid up because of the heat transfer. Go back to wood. In fact I will retrofit a wood one to mine.The build quality still seems quite good, it just seems the design team had a brain fart."
1,Wish I had listened to the poor design reviews. Very dissapointing.,"The overall build quality is pretty good as to be expected from Weber. However, it really does have a serious and perplexing design flaw. The ventilation holes are located high on the sides of the grill, where the handle attaches. This places them ABOVE the charcoal so it never gets enough air. Not only is it difficult to maintain a temp of over 325 degrees but you will have trouble keeping it lit with the cover on. Forget about cooking a steak or burgers on this grill as it doesn't ever get hot enough to cook beef properly. Weber should have never let this product go to market."
1,Poor Vent Design,"I own many Weber products and find that the design is almost always first class. That is not the case with this gold version of the Smokey Joe. As others have said, the vents being on the side does not allow for proper air flow through the charcoal bed. As a result, it does not produce enough heat to properly seer and cook a steak. Other foods cook very slowly as well. It is so bad that I don't find it to be worth using at all. Although the quality of construction is excellent, I plan to discard this model and purchase the silver, which I have used at the home of a friend. The silver model produces a hot fire and cooks as expected. It will not be as easy to carry, but that is a small price to pay for proper cooking ability."
1,Silver or Gold?,"I bought the Gold model. When the wind is blowing, the Gold model is fine, and the signature feature (the handle that snaps over the lid) is a good safety item when grilling is over.When the wind is not blowing, the grill does not work properly. The reason is because the vents are paradoxically situated above the coals. This problem can be alleviated by folding a medium-size piece of cardboard and standing over the grill fanning the coals for 10-15 minutes. When this is done, you will be a Smoky Joe too but at least the coals will be hot. However, do not put the grill top on when the wind is not blowing, for the coals will smoke and go out almost immediately (even with the vents open). After one use, I drilled 3 vent-holes in the bottom. It helps, but I still have to fan the coals. A common hair styling blow dryer can also be rigged to provide the necessary ventilation. I have tried this, and the low setting seems to work fine."
3,good - but don't expect high heat,"As a few others have noted, the vents on the smokey joe gold are located on the side. This doesn't allow enough air flow, to get high temps for searing steaks, etc. This is a solid and well built grill, but it is best suited for lower temp cooking, such as hot dogs, chicken, sausages. If you want a sear on your steak, forget it.The smokey joe silver has vents on the bottom, and I think this would be a better bbq for searing steaks. However there is no lid holder on the silver.I sold my smokey joe gold, and I got a charcoal-go-anywhere. Now with this I can get a solid sear on steaks. The coal is located a little too close to the grill, but other than that it's good. I use the raw cast iron grate off my weber silver 'A' and it almost fits perfectly on top. I also use lump mesquite charcoal, and with the cast iron - now we're talking a seared steak - just like the best steakhouse."
2,Smokey slow,"As others have suggested the Gold has the vents above the coals - not sure what the weber folks were thinking. I've had many of the regular silver joes and loved them (i grill 4-5 times a week) they have high heat and even cooking. This grill was obviously designed for the occasional griller who can leave the top off for his hot dogs and burgers. best advice - avoid the gold, go for the silver - if like me you purchased the gold version either give it to a part-time griller or chuck it out - its pretty useless for serious grilling. wish i'd known before i plopped down my $35."
1,Disappointed,"First of all, the directions were followed. The watch would not keep time when it was removed overnight. It is difficult to reset because the reset pin is extremely tight and hard to pull out. Unfortunately, some bracelet links were removed to fit my husband's wrist and the watch had to be returned to an out of state repair location. This involves 5 or 6 dollars postage plus a 15 dollar check to the Seiko repair place."
4,replacement parts,I knew I could bring that old/antique Singer electric back to life if I had the right parts and some oil. Works like new now And a lot cheaper then a new one!
5,Good,This product fit perfect on my old fashioned singer sewing machine. This was just he beginning of the restoration of something that needed a touch of love.
3,"Good product, high price","The price isn't super high, but I did find these for less at Jo Ann's between placing my order and receiving it. Fit my Singer 66-16 class machine just fine, and I bought an additional set for the bobbin belt that fit a White Rotary from 1917."
4,Sewing Machine Belts-,Just what I needed in order to make my machine continue to run. I;ve never had to replace one before and this should be pretty easy.
5,An Amazing Book,"As a scientist with great faith---and a survivor of three separate cancers---I came to this book with a lot of faith and treatment experience. This is an amazing summary of the literature relating religion and health. There are many, many associations between religious commitment and practice and health, with major implications for crafting healthful lifestyles and treatment of illness. This book is scientifically credible, inspirational from a religious perspective, and interesting throughout. 5 stars only because that is the top star value!!"
1,A ghostly effort,"Given the current trend to imitate Doyle, I thought I'd give this book a chance. I was disappointed. I read all of Sherlock Holmes when I was 12. The writing was magical and the reader could not predict Holmes' thoughts or actions. With this book, I wasn't a third of the way through it before I knew who the villain was as well as the accomplice. The whole book did not have the feeling that Doyle gave to his characters. There are just some things that should be left alone. Doyle and Holmes are two of them."
1,How can this happen again?,"How is it that this hack writer can get another book published? Her first effort was a pale imitation of the genuine article, and this second effort is more tripe from the same garbage can."
1,Cure for Insomnia,Disappointing throughout...A padded short story...Characters have silly actions and motives...Holmes milks a job so he can continue to eat for free.
3,Graphic SF Reader,"My spousal unit's favorite cartoon, she is always going on about. She says it is 'cool' and likes the way it is designed. This is talking about this publication, anyway. It does have a couple of nifty elements, like slightly translucent text and other things. I guess this is the 'Cine-Manga' style. As far as I can tell, these are straight adaptations of the cartoons, as I have seen one of these."
5,Great Read for manager training,I work in the sales industry and this book has become invaluable in training my manangers to ensure no employee gets left behind. We actively use many of the techniques taught in this book daily to help build morale and keep active employees.Must READ!
4,Managers guide to survival,"Book delivers interesting out of the box view on why we, managers, fail to treat people in way to make them thrill at work. besides the deadly sins of the managerial work story reveals also less conventional bites of thoughts on how to turn manager-employee relations into more synergic pattern. I strongly recommend to read this book to seasoned managers that will through the course of the book both nod and shake their heads on what is being served to them.Warning: The comprehension of principles discussed in book requires own managerial experience, thus this is not a how-to book for wanna-be or soon-become managers."
5,everybody in a managerial position of any kind should read this book,"fantastic reading, clearly written in a jovial manner that gets the point across without confusing the reader. I urge everybody in a management position of any kind to read this book and discuss it with staff at your meetings. If every manager read and implimented a fraction of what is in this book, what a fantastic workforce America would have.Thanks for a fantastic product."
5,Very funny and family oriented,Myself and my family thoroughly enjoyed this Scooby Doo DVD and have watched it numerous times. Too many to count. It just gets better every time we sit down to watch. We highly recommend this DVD for any fun loving family.
2,Impractical,"As a 4th year student looking for case studies to enhance a dermatology clerkship, this was not the ideal choice. Case photos were sharp and clear and citations were included with each case. However, the cases were mostly rare and unusual, a book of zebras aimed more for the aspiring dermatologist reviewing for specialty boards I suppose. Not the choice for primary care dermatology."
5,Great book!,Love Pilates and was pleasantly surprised by how informative and easy this book is to exercise with!
3,Pilates for Beginners,I purchased this book along with the 4 Dyna-Band set thinking they would strengthen my back area but it made the situation worse. I'm sure the exercises and bands would be good for others.
5,Franklin is cute and entertaining,"Franklin's School Play is a cute and entertaining book. I enjoyed it very much. It is about a young turtle named Franklin who has a main role in his school's Christmas play, The Nutcracker. The day before the the opening night, Franklin gets so nervous that he can't speak. But, fortunately, he later gains his confidence and does great in the main performance. I think the book teaches kids that it's ok to be afraid sometimes, and that one can succeed if he or she works hard. It is also a great story to put a person in the Christmas mood."
3,3 for Jason X/ 3 1/2 for Jason Goes to Hell,"Jason goes to Hell is one of the better Jason films in quite a while. The only problem is that they have changed the Jason rules for this one, making him a demonic spirit who's worm like form enters the bodies of others to possess them and turn them into Jason. It is interesting, but it throughs out the other 8 movies that came before it. Better actors in this one, and a really high body count make it interesting. Jason X starts off great, but falls rapidly. Frozen in modern time and then mistakenly revived on a spaceship far in the future, Jason runs amok. A few interesting deaths can't hold this one together."
5,Great quality,These mats were of terrific quality. I would definitely recommend them to others who are considering purchasing them. Don't hesitate if you are looking for some good mats.
5,"Great 70's Spider Film, Shatner Shines","Kingdom of the Spiders is a lesser known gem that came out along with some other films like Food of the Gods, Day of the Animals, and Grizzly. William Shatner is in prime form as he tries to save an Arizonia town from infestation. The spiders themselves-tarantulas are decidedly creepy and while the film doesn't have a whole lot of plot necessarily you'll shudder and shake as Shatner, love interest, and some oldsters try to save themselves from the invading arachnids."
4,This item works as said it would,"We started using them as soon as they arrived and we found out that we really need more . It saved us so far few plants some zucchini and some tomatoes . They are very good in the cold NW weather , good to have and it pretty much it is a must have when you try to grow tropical plants in the cold weather."
4,I love these things!,I use these every year and have nothing but good things to say about them. I leave them on through the entire growing season so I don't damage the plants in an effort to remove them and they don't need to be refilled that often so they aren't a bother. They have taken a lot of the early planting worries away and are a must for anybody serious about growing great tomatoes.
5,Kind Arthur's Round Table,"creative, clever, packed full of powerful information and metaphorical connections for organizational application. Enjoyed reading via King Arthur's lens and valued the informative information."
5,"Love it, Love It, LOVE IT!!!",I keep this CD in my vehicle and listen to it everyday! It's very uplifting and reminds me of the music my mother played on Sunday mornings when I was growing up.
4,It takes me back!,These are classic tunes that I grew up listening to. I bought it for me and my husband as stocking stuffers for Christmas and I am really enjoying these songs. They are sung from the heart and add to any worship experience!
5,Great addition to my collection!,Great addition to my collection. Sometimes I enjoy a musical break from all of the finger snapping and head bobbing. Glad I made the purchase.
5,Review for Living The Gospel:Gospel Greats,"This is a great CD it has some good old school gospel songs on it.Some of these songs I use to hear coming up in church I miss hearing them but now I have them songs such as Lord,You don't have to move my mountain and Coming up the rough side of the mountain,These songs are great and offer the encouragement that we sometimes need to hear."
3,Whites & Blacks in Early Texas,"This book mixes fact & fiction to relate stories of life in Texas after the Civil War. Illustrations -- I wish they were credited; is it possible the author did them all? They are part of what makes this book so interesting, showing women, and former slaves in their physical and emotional struggles to make a living. A string of short stories, one is about Irish immigration, the generation of the author's parents. Recommended for anyone interested in pioneer life, early Texas settlers, post Civil War period in the West, black history, or Texas history."
5,GRAMMY,ANYTHING THAT BRINGS JOY TO MY 4 YEAR OLD GRANDDAUGHTER IS WONDERFUL. tHIS ITEM STAYS AT GRAMMY'S HOUSE SO IT IS HERE WHEN SHE COMES TO VISIT.
1,USE NEWBORN PREMIE'S INSTEAD!,"This is a crazy little idea..actually adding more to our landfill. Anyway, my daughter bought the baby. We discussed money and recycling, etc and decided to purchase baby wash clothes and pins to use as a cloth diaper. Fun, but not a good idea..didn't work, so now they are burp clothes since the bottle leaks water onto the chin, which does happen in the real world..anyway..we will buy the premmie diapers and hopefully she'll tire of changing the diapers and use pretend water in the near future!!"
1,DON'T buy these diapers!,Agree with everyone else....we used the 2 diapers that came with the doll and decided they were a JOKE!! We only buy newborn diapers they are only $5 for like 50 of them! Way cheaper!! Don't waste your money on these!
2,Baby Alive Diapers,"These diapers work really well with the Baby Alive Doll. The only problem I found is that the doll has to go to the bathroom so much and it gets really expensive buying these diapers.We have already been through two packages of them in 4 days. I really like them because they are the right size and have great absorbancy. However, they are almost $1 a diaper."
1,LEaky & Don't Fit,"You're better off just getting regular preemie diapers, this are overpriced and messy.If you don't mind the initial expense, and want to save in the long run, buy a couple cloth ""all in one"" style diapers - they have snaps or velcro like disposables and can be washed and reused."
2,Don't waste your money,"I bought the initial refill pack of diapers for my daughter's doll and they didn't work half as well or even last more than a day for the six pack, so I bought a pack of regular pampers, preemie or newborn size work fine, but the preemie size is almost exact and you get 30 in a pack v/s 6 for about the same price."
4,New Orleans Chef Taught at Delglado Trades School,This book is of historical importance because J. H. Breland taught at Delgado Central Trades School (now Delgado Community College) in New Orleans for several years prior to WWII.
4,Helps keep my Daughter entertained in the car and dinner out,This has really been great for my daughter who is 3 years old. We keep it in the car and she uses it while on longer drives. We also take it into restaurants with us and it keeps her busy during the wait.
5,Towner's solo orchestra ...,"Recall first hearing Icarus back in the late 70s @the low end of the FM dial in Wash., D.C.: I was bowled over.This wasn't just pop music anymore: this bordered on the orchestral. Later I heard Towner explain in a phone interv. that in fact he tried to infuse an orchestral quality into his guitar playing.Icarus remains my sentimental favorite here; Ogden Road was covered later by Oregon & truly has that orchestral quality. Erg is a tour de force in guitar percussion, & Silence of a Candle is one of the most melancholy tunes there is: shimmering solo piano.I caught on to Towner, Oregon, & the whole ECM label crowd rather late in life: this album was already six years old when I heard Icarus. But if you look for talent & creative ability in musicians, then Towner's your guy, & Diary stands out among the several granddaddies of ""world"" music."
5,Adorable,"I purchased this product for my boyfriend's birthday, and it was exactly what I wanted. The questions regarding your relationship make you think, without any chance of offending or being too personal to write so others could possibly see. It's easy to read, and it's just a wonderful gift to record a special relationship with!!!The only thing I would change is more writing space!"
4,"Very sweet, even for the young and engaged","When I saw this book on the shelf, I picked it up and immediately started giggling to myself while thinking about the questions like ""On our first date we..."" and ""We would have never met if..."" I bought the book for my fiance and I as a Valentine's Day present for the both of us. It will be wonderful to fill out together, have at our wedding, and anticipate writing the history as it comes to us!"
5,PERFECTION,"Wow! When I saw this book, I HAD to have it. I'm 19 years old and me and my boyfriend have been together for 2 years. Our relationship is wonderful and I was looking for a journal that i could write all of our personal things in. I didn't buy it as a gift or anything, but he still thinks it's great and we can't wait until this book is all filled up! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
5,A beautiful record of their time together.,"My friend's husband died 6 months ago. This book has been her grief companion, as she puts on paper the many memories they had created together. It means a lot to her to have this record of their love. In moments when she misses him, she reads some of the stories she's recorded and feels him close again."
2,FOR MARRIED PEOPLE,i should have read the reviews a little closer. almost 50% of this book is about pre wedding and post wedding feelings. not for you if you are not married
3,OK,This journal has some good questions but it does not give you the feeling that you are holding a quality product... the pages are kind of rough and dark... and there are entirely too many questions making it seems overwhelming to complete. I had originally bought for a gift but ended up keeping it because it didn't seem very nice
5,"If you're buying this, you know what you're in for...","It'll be fun to look back at it in 40 years, but it's important to realize that you're being confined to a set of specific questions/topics. They're widely varied, and not all of them may apply to you.Perhaps the most important thing to realize is that you're going to be forc.. errr... strongly encouraged by your wife to define your relationship in 20-hand-written-line increments, one page at a time.It's hopelessly romantic, but all-in-all a fun thing to look at later on."
5,"Melody, melody, melody","It's hard to believe that any one person could write so many indelible, intelligent pop songs. Most more-famous performers would be lucky to write even one song this stellar in their entire careers (of course all too many singers these days don't write their own material anyway, which is all the more indictment in my mind). Nik's singing is perfection, too, and the production is ideal, supporting the song and highlighting the singing and the melody. It's absolutely depressing that music this good should be so little noticed in the U.S. If you like pure pop music, just buy this, put it on endless replay, and clear your calendar for a few hours."
4,Where's 'You've Got To Laugh'?,"Following the out-of-nowhere-after-ten-years masterpiece of '15 Minutes', I was (Frankly) disappointed with 'To Be Frank'. With average writing and a downright gooey-sounding final mix, I wondered if the promise of '15 Minutes' was spent. Not to Fear. 'You've Got To Laugh' is the awaited 2nd masterpiece. But where is it? Not available here on Amazon. I was forced to download it from iTunes rather than pay for an expensive import. It's so good I'd pay again for the physical CD, so I hope he'll decide to make it available in the U.S. We'll be back up to 5 stars again for that one!"
5,I Like It,"I think this is a great book for the kosher cook, and the price is fantastic - the lowest I've seen. The recipes are great, and the book is really beautiful. Would make a great gift for anyone who keeps kosher."
2,Mediocre recipes with intensive preparation,"The recipes in this book are not in the least unique: there is nothing in these books not found in the standard modern cookbooks such as the New Joy of Cooking or Silver Palette. What differentiates these recipes is the superfluous use of packaged foods, such as boxed Italian dressing powder (which is basically salt and common spices), which actually makes them less friendly to the kosher cook since they may not be available supervised. Fishbein puts all her energy into the Design of the food, for instance suggesting that you buy individual pumpkins for each of your 16 sukkot guests in which to serve soup, or that you serve your Shavuot meal entirely out of flowerpots, or that you have different set of dishes for each of the holidays. These little tips do make amusing reading, but for that you can check the book out from the library."
3,"Gorgeous book, but some recipes lack clarity","This book is absolutely gorgeous - and would be perfect were it not for the fact that recipes are not always clear. For example, the recipe for Vegetarian Cholent says to add water to reach top of crockpot - but crockpots come in a variety of sizes, so this could turn out very watery and bland if using a much larger pot than the author's. Surely the recipe should either state what size crockpot the author uses, or mention the amount of water she adds, so those of us with different-sized crockpots can make necessary adjustments.Likewise, it would have been helpful if the recipe gave a hint as to how many people it serves. Neither cholent recipe bothered to mention that."
5,Great Cooking Service,"I thought these grates weren't good enough to sears meat, boy was I Wrong. The beautiful lines on the meats got me great reviews from my guests. Easy to clean too."
5,Weber Grates Are Great,"I had my Weber Grill over 8 years and the grates were looking rusty and actually coming apart in some areas. I always burned off the old food/marinate after cooking.... and brushed off the burnt on material, but alas after 8 years it was time. I was concerned about not going directly to Weber for these grates, but they are ""Genuine Weber"" parts and are working great on my grill. I wonder now if it is time for new ""flavorizing bars""?"
5,"Yay, no hat!","This is a great head net, because you can actually get away with not wearing one of those round hats. Other nets absolutely need the hat."
3,Coleman and Coghlan the same,"Just wanted to mention that I bought 4 different types in preperation for the Everglades:Coleman 827-B360T Insect Head Net - Green at $4Coghlan's 8941 Mosquito Head Net at $2.45Grabber Outdoors Pop Up Field Hat and Headnet Thin/Lightweight with Storage Bag- Green, Large at $12Sea to Summit Mosquito Head Net Sea to Summit Mosquito Head Net at $9Opening them the Coleman and Coghlan are exactly the same. So just get the one that is cheaper. I will leave a review how well they worked out after we come home."
5,Works Great,"Used on a recent fishing trip and worked great, kept the bugs out of my eyes and ears. Really need to be used with a hat, baseball cap was just fine."
1,junk,i bought this product in hopes for relief from the flying blood suckers but i tried this on over my hat and looked good for a minute then the neck fastener band broke and this wont work anymore cause my neck is exposed and overall i wish i paid for the better headnet then this junk save your cash and spend a bit more for one better then this.
2,Not for black flies,It's light and fits just right over a hat and would be a wonderful product if the mesh was fine enough. Unfortunately the mesh is rather course and will keep out mosquitoes and houseflies but is useless against black flies. I grew to detest this product after having to use it for a few hours in black fly season.
3,Elastic doesn't last,"I got three of these head nets in June of 2011. With a hat underneath, they mostly protect me from bugs. Mostly, because the net is close to my head, and my ears have been bitten, and also little bugs are able to get up and inside the net. I don't know why or how.But, my beef is that, for all the fact that these are Coleman products, and I expected better quality, the elastic on the bottom has broken on all three within a year. I am going to have to take them apart to repair the elastic. You'd think it would last a while."
3,Holes are big enough to let in small insects,"First off, this does work to protect against mosquitoes. But it does have pretty big holes, big enough to let in some of the smaller insects. It is super light-weight compared to other headnets that I have (which is good because I am ultralight camping), but beware of its limitations."
5,It worked.,"We have a ""Midge"" problem in our area and this worked out great. The best part was that i could still wear my baseball cap under it."
4,Not Bad,These don't seem too bad except they hang right on the face but I don't think it's something I can't work with.
1,amazon screws up 2 times in a row,"this pictured headnet is what i ordered. they sent me something else. i called. they said ""sorry"" we will send you the correct one asap. guess what- same wrong POS. negative stars would be appropriate if possible. i am an avid amazon shopper. you just lost a valuable customer. not just because of this, but 5 differant instances in 2 months. amazon is down the drain with the filth."
4,Netting,"Classic no thrill netting. Works well, no holes, no strings hanging out. Works well to keep mosquito out without smelling like bug spray or sticking to your face."
3,"Good Net, but Not Great.",This is a good quality net but it does not fit ideally around the face since it will stick to the face and neck depending on the size of your head and how it is worn. I recomend wearing it over a hat to allow for a good enough separation between the net and the face. For the price it is a good net. It will aliveate insect pestering a great deal but this is not the best net available on the market.
2,Very Obnoxious to Wear; Too Small to wear with a Hat,"Maybe I have an enormous noggin, but this was impossible to wear comfortably with any hats to keep the netting off your face. Instead the netting lays directly on your face annoying the living sin out of you. I felt as if rolling around in a HPV invested termite mound would be more comfortable.Your results and comfort level may vary."
4,Mosquito hat,The mosquito net worked as needed. It didn't fit perfectly over fairly wide brimmed hat. It did keep the biters at bay.
5,An insect head net is sexier than a mosquito bite to the face!,"So the brave UPS man rolls up the windy road to my house, I'm just digging in some rocky soil with noseeums dive bombing me all over my face and neck. I immediately ran to him, ripped open the box and put this on and then I signed for the delivery of my summertime bug abatement items. In a manner of minutes I was ENJOYING THE OUTDOORS. Amazing what a little face mask can do for yardwork productivity in the forest. Provides adequate ventilation, doesn't get stuffy or any kind of smell to it. Also I like that I can put in on top of any hat, and it also goes around the collar on my shirts to protect my neck skin.Thanks mosquito head net makers."
1,refund,my local customs department did not give clearance for shou wu pian.Still waiting for amazon/china guide to refund my money
2,"""... pero que necesidad?""","... para que tanto ""LO MISMO?"" Lo siento, but there have been ""tantisimas compilaciones"" over the last two years, and no new material unrelated to projects, concerts, or duos released since 1995. I'd surmise that members of Juanga's following are deserved of a ""Gracias Por Esperar II"" for this rather disappointing and unexpected second wait."" Does anybody have a time machine out there? ;)"
4,"academic, but worth the effort","Apparently condensed from a multi-volume doctoral dissertation, this book is both over and under inclusive. Elkins displays encyclopedic knowledge of his field in order to support the important and worthwhile point he makes in the introduction, but also leaves out much of the very technical detail that would have been needed to convince his fellow PH.D.s. One could just read the intro and the envoi to get the lesson Elkins hopes to teach, but I'm glad i stuck with it for the long haul through the intervening chapters. A book for those who are serious about the history of western culture."
4,great filter,I used this filter inline of my edelbrock carburetor..its clear to see any debris from going into the fuel system.
4,Not for newbie. Great if u have some ideas already!,This is a good book to learn asp .net if you have background of Client/Server side programming from any other language such as PHP. If you are new/beginner I won't recommend this book. I got stuck in many places while implementing the programs discussed in this book and I had to use my previous expertise to solve the problems. You may need to change here and there of the coding to work properly based on your systems configuration. I gave four star instead of 5 as in the beginning I thought I will be able to breeze through the book without any problem. Things work but after spending some time in changing codes. By the way I was using Visual Studio .Net to do the programs discuessed in this book. Good luck!!
3,Begining asp.net from novice to pro,Real interesting book tells me what I need to know the only problem is now I dont have an excuse for not doing my home work ...
1,Buyer beware: older than it looks,"I bought this book last week, thinking it was a new book because the date is in this year. But, as I started skimming through it, I think now it is really an old book, that has been updated some but not well. How do I think this? Look at many of the screens in chapter 11 (Trace, Log, Error Handling) - they all show dates in 2001 (screen 11-9, 11-10, 11-11)! Same in chapter 17, screen 17-7. Probably many more. If that's when this was really written, .NET 1.0 was still beta then, so this is beta .NET, not even 1.0 even though back of book says 1.1. I haven't found any specific errors yet, but I worry. Only place I see 1.1 mentioned in book so far is in introduction. I see a lot of these old 2001 screens right away but not 1.1. Good thing I got this cheap."
2,returned the drum,"When the drum arrived we found the tuning rope to be very course. It was impossible to tune it without the holes in the head starting to stretch. We were worried they would tear if we put more pressure on them to tune the drum.The one beater which should have been thin was an actual stick from a tree with the bark still on it. Looked like one end had been sharpened with a pencil sharpener.We could have replaced the rope, bought another beater but we would never have been happy with the overall poor quality of the drum.So we spent $27.00 to return it. We did get a full prompt refund on the original purchase price."
1,Romance of the Three kindoms IX,"-DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!! They couldn't have ruined this game more. IT SUCKS SOOOOO BAD. I took it back and got 'The Suffering',which is great. And i'm a fan of the ROT3K series!!DON'T BOTHER! NOT EVEN A GOOD RENTAL!!"
4,Grill Cover,"We recently purchased the Weber Silver A Grill, even with it's spectacular warranties, we wanted to optimize our new grill's life. That is why we wanted a heavy duty grill cover. This cover will do the trick. It covers everything on the grill and is heavier than most covers on the market. Well worth the money."
5,Heavy-Duty Cover,"It fit the grill perfectly and is doing the job of protecting our Weber so far, through 2 seasons - winter and spring in the northwest."
5,silver A now covered,"great cover, heavy and well made. fit's perfect. it didn't come with any bourbon or beer though. I was dissappointed."
4,What Baby Books Should Be,"My first (and probably only grandson) Parents loved it. It is so much closer to the reality of 21st Century parenthood, than the cloying (sp?) dreck that is the mainstream baby book that our children, and us and our parents - I am going back to the 1920's, had as baby books. This is the first change of formula (bad pun - sorry) that I have seen. The part about the photo vultures in the hospital, 90 minutes post partum is truth I would have never imagined. Kudos to all of you who are experiencing parenthood in this century. This book will be an accurate record of your travails."
3,Not your typical baby book,I bought this book for my pregnant niece. She and the baby's father both have tattoos and I thought they would like it. Unfortunately is was not what the wanted. It would be great for the eclectic parents.
5,Great gift for first time parenst,While looking for a gift to celebrate the birth of our great grand daughter I came across this book and thought it would be perfect for the new parents. It's just the type of baby journal a young edgy couple would like. Needless to say the new parents were surprised and happy with the book and according to them have spent many hours laughing at the new things to record. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants a new and slightly different approach to the standard baby journal.
4,A bit dated...but fun!,"It might behoove the authors to revise this book before its next printing, to include newer slang and pop culture references. Still, my friends got a big kick out of this book. A great gift idea for new parents!"
3,Okay,"This book is okay. My husband is a tattoo artist, so I bought this for one of his friends when he had a baby. It's just not quite as funny as I thought it would be. Basically they put all of the funny items in the ad, and there isn't much else."
2,There are better baby books out there,"While looking for a unique baby shower gift, I stumbled across this book and picked it up due to its catchy title. A few items made me laugh, but my overall impression is that the book tries too hard with pop culture references that are soon to be outdated and confusing.This book might be amusing for a few minutes at a baby shower, but is destined to end up on a bookshelf, unused.If you're looking for a humorous baby book that parents would actually take time to fill out, I would suggest The Inappropriate Baby Book by Jennifer Stinson. It's more charming and less cynical than Baby's First Tattoo and has the potential to draw laughs for years to come."
4,I found it hilarious,"Warning: amke sure your humor button is firmly set to ON and engage your senses of irony and the ridiculous before ordering this book.I was confused by some of the other reviews. I never thought this was intended as a ""baby book"" as one reviewer apparently did. I think the humor is absolutely spot on. When I got to the part about ""Number of diapers intended to go into the Diaper Genie vs. Number of diapers you've actually crammed into the Diaper Genie"", I really laughed because my husband and I are always trying to stuff ""just one more"" diaper into that dratted machine.Overall, this book reflects some of the wierdness of modern parenting as seen in the lives of those featured in People Magazine with a good dose of reality for the rest of us."
3,Baby's First Tattoo: A Memory Book for Modern Parents,This is not quite what I expected. I thought it could be used for a baby book but it's really more for reading. There are places to write stuff down on some pages. It is funny and very modern. Also it pertains more to the city life. You will need a baby book other than this one for your little on but this is a hoot to read!!
2,Cute,"This would be a great gift for new parents or parents-to-be. It's really more of something to look through and have a chuckle than an actual baby book to fill in. But, like I said, it's cute."
3,I think they're confused about the audience.,"See, those of us who don't have children usually don't precisely because we see what a wreck they have made of their parents' lives. And the scariest thing is that the parents don't even realize it. They are the ones who coo over spit-up and bowel movements. They cart their infants along to see The Mummy and Blade II. They let them howl and throw food at the other diners in fine restaurants. The edginess of this book is lost on them."
4,"very sweet, great quality baking cups","These cupcake papers are unique, oh-so-cute and perfect for our teddy bear birthday party! The colors are vibrant and the paper is a nice, heavier quality than the usual grocery-store cupcake and muffin papers - more of a waxy/crisp feeling to the paper that seems sturdier than others in our pantry. Made in Germany, which was a nice suprise for us (we heart Germany) - though a tad pricey, perhaps due to the ""import"" status. Price is the only reason for 4 versus 5 stars from us. Also, it was hard to decipher from the description because it says ""large,"" but these are the REGULAR size cupcake papers (not mini-muffin or jumbo size) - I took a chance, and luckily they were the correct size I needed. Very sweet design and great quality - recommend!"
2,DISAPPOINTING,Two out of the four worked. Two Did not ! Two made the sound and two did not. We tried everything. I am very dissappointed.
5,satisfied customer,"These work great! It does take a few weeks for the pest to get the idea to leave, but they eventually really do. The sounds don't penetrate anything solid, so you should have one in every room. Make sure you don't use baits and traps while using this because that actually draws the pest in."
3,No more bugs?,I bought 2 of these. I wanted the mouse out but not dead. Instead it has driven the mouse crazy. I'd wake up with my plants and stereo lines destroyed. The repeller didn't make the mouse leave it only ticked it off. I ended up using poison.
1,Product did not work,I have this product located by the door in my garage and I also have a conventional mouse trap directly under the repeller and have killed two mice in the traps. I also have other traps set in the garage that have killed mice. I have wooded lots on each side of my house so I purchased this product to keep the mice out of my garage but it is not working for me. I have had no sucess with this product.
5,Great Dance Mix!,Fantastic combination of classic and new! Great rhythm and sound! The merging of the classic YES song Owner of a lonely heart with dance music was just genius. It's a great song to dance to.
5,"Works great, easy to use",So far I like this bender machine. Secures the putter well and its size makes it portable. I can clamp it to a benchmate type folding bench at the range. This enables me to do the final fitting on site for the customer.
4,Tandava,"If you like an active CD for yoga this one will suit your practice well. During some brief moments the music can be a little distracting, but overall a good addition to one's yoga music library."
5,"Smooth Trance Music is here, from Pathaan","Of the several CD of Pathaan, this is the smoothest. Soothing, cool, charming and with very little bumbs and jumps. If you like meditative trance music, this one is better. Mystical, and transcends time. You can listen to this while walking or cooking, etc. Relaxing."
4,Just what you need for indirect cooking,"Great for all your indirect cooking that you may want to do on your grill. Once they are put in place they are secure and don't move at all. They may get messy with drippings, etc. but if you put a disposable drip pan with some water in it in the center of the grill you will catch most of the grease, etc. and also get the moist heat that is desirable for long term roasting that will keep the roast, ribs or whatever nice and moist."
2,Not very durable,"The kids I bought this for had great fun with it - for all of about 10 minutes, which is all it lasted before bursting."
1,Skylink AS-101 Alarm Sensor,Connects wirelessly to your AM-001 main unit. Theres only one problem... IT NEVER GETS TRIGGERED WHEN ANY OF THE ALARMS IN YOUR HOUSE ARE ON! This makes it useless.I placed it next to every smoke alarm in my house. Pressed the test button on each alarm.... got nothing.I don't recommend this device at all.
4,"Great solo's. Nice to hear something lean, mean and raw.","If you like weather report or return to forever, you need to hear this CD. Wayne Reynolds is a very scary bass player who is obviously into Jaco, but he's definately doing his own thing. I heard several different influences as I listened, such as Ornette Coleman, early 70's Miles, and the two I mentioned above. Overall, I was very impressed with the CD."
5,Seat was a big improvement.,This seat is great. It is a huge improvement and doesn't look like a granny seat.
4,Sunlite Cloud-9 Bicycle Suspension Comfort Saddle.,"I use this on my road bike and I am very pleased. While not built for speed, it is comfortable. I also have added a gel seat cover and I can ride for hours without very much discomfort."
3,Okay,"The trap worked as it should, I just don't think this these traps in general are effective for Rats (mice probably but not rats). The rat I am dealing with managed to removed the bait three nights in a row, even when I set it to have a hair trigger. The one time it did go off, the rat got away unscathed. I am now trying the rat zapper to see if that works. The rat comes every night and tries to get in the drip pan area of my BBQ, which grosses me out. I don't want to use poison as I don't want it to die somewhere and decay (like in my roof or something)."
4,It works.,"Uh, this is a mouse trap on steroids and Amazon wants me to write at least 20 words? OK, that parts done.Bait it. Set it. Collect dead rat (before it gets funky, trust me). Wife and daughters say, ""Ewww, gross.... Can I see it?"" Dispose. Repeat."
1,Doesn't work,"Mice ate bait right off and were never caught. Ended up feeding about 4 mice and fattening them up over the course of 3-4 months, and only one got caught (that's the 1 star). Purchased a humane mouse trap that caught mice alive and I caught the other 3 mice in 3 days and haven't had any recurrences. Don't waste time with this (and conscience over killing a mouse) - get the green house ""humane"" mouse trap which is far more effective and won't worsen your karma."
4,"SO-SO SONG, OUTRAGEOUS REMIXES","The actual song really isn't strong enough on its own to warrant release as a single, but the remixes of Drowned World and Sky Fits Heaven make this a must have for the Madonna fan or clubbie alike."
1,Received Wrong Product,"I probably would have loved the CD if I received the correct one. Rather than Sky Fits Heaven, I received another single instead."
5,Great Song,This song is so great. If you love swing you will love this song. It is up-beat and easy to dance to Jump Jive and Well (might have hear it on the gap comm.) is a great swing song too.
4,Ally McBeal,"Ally McBeal was a romance comedy that took on some very controversial topics, even in today's society. Every episode builds on the last storyline between characters and new subject matter from new clients. There are always funny/sad events between the main characters, with some morality questions coming to my mind, which makes me consider other points of view than just my own. The show was very well written, and the actors did amazingly well portraying the individual quirks of their character."
4,ally mcbeal,"the only problem i had with this dvd is that it only plays on a region free dvd play, i don't understand why an american series like this would only be recorded on a different region. thank you"
5,ally mcbeal realworld,"That whole episode helped me through some tough times ,and even now it helps me to understand even if you breakup with someone the 2 of you can still remain friends.the music by vonda shepard touched my deeply as well and also showed me you can breakup on good terms,Because everyone has their mr or mrs right out there its all about the journey of finding them .You could find them in a person but it just may be the wrong time,it doesnt have to be a BadRomance you can still look at it kindly and not wonder what if because the right person is probably right around the corner,sitting at that both next to you or even be a lawyer that wants love in her life."
2,Can't punch more than 5 sheets of paper,"I've had this hole punch for over a year now, but only use it once a week or so. You can't punch more than 5 sheets of paper at a time because the metal parts get stuck. Your papers will get jammed in the hole punch and you'll have to tear them to get them out. Works great if you want to punch <5 sheets at a time. Otherwise, don't buy this product."
3,Acceptable Overall,"My Swingline Model 20 3 Hole Punch is now about six months old and has been generally acceptable. It was offered for a very competitive price and has a lifetime warranty, which I may soon explore. The adjustments work smoothly and the paper guides are faultless. The one area of operation where I have been encountering recurring problems is in cleanliness of cuts. In other words, one of the punches leaves hanging chads on paper. (Maybe I should refer the matter to the Florida Board of Elections.)In general the chad problem can be minimized, but not altogether eliminated, by punching five or more sheets of paper at a time; one or two are guaranteed to not get clean punches.Overall, I would say that the machine is satisfactory, but I probably wouldn't buy it again knowing of it's proclivity to produce the always troublesome chads."
2,For the most casual of fans only,". . .and who determines that this is ""the"" Official book? Beware for all of those with even a cursory knowledge of the sport."
4,Hmmm.....,"...is the best way to describe my feelings for this book. I agree with several of the reviewers here that another proofreading would have been in order as there are several mistakes and bits of misinformation in the book. However, there are no more mistakes in this book as there have been in other recent skating history books like Inside Figure Skating -- but unlike that book, ""Official Book"" is an objective and technical presentation of the sport of figure skating. The jump and other technical description sections are also nicely done.This book should definitely be part of your skating book collection -- just not your official 'dictionary' of reference."
4,An enjoyable book for skaters and fans alike!,"This book is very thorough, with lots of pictures, and lots of reference, almost like that of an encylopedia. It does, however, have some minor errors, but overall, it's an enjoyable book, and a good book to add to your book collection."
3,Disappointed,"I was a little disappointed in this book. I feel that it's thinly disguised as advertisement and publicity for the USFSA's current crop of skaters. They tend to somewhat ignore the superstar skaters who've made figure skating the huge success that it is today. Too bad, really."
3,"Pretty, pretty, pretty - But Who Wrote/Proofed It?","The photography is lovely, but beyond that garnish there isn't a whole lot of substance. Until I came to this site, I had no idea that Peggy Fleming ""wrote"" the book, only that she provided the introduction. A winner for the casual fan, but not a must-have for those within the sport."
5,A great book for figure skaters and fans alike!,"""The official book of Figure Skating"" is the best factual book about figure skating and its history I have ever read. Being a skater myself, it gives all of the inside information on the sport that makes it a lot easier to follow the action. It includes most all of the past and present skaters and bios on them. I didn't find any errors, like I have found in some other encyclopedias on figure skating. Really informative for a first time skater or spectator. The USFSA has really put some time into this book, and I recommend this book for anyone who enjoys the beauty of figure skating or just wants to find out more about the sport or their favourite skater!"
4,Great Book...but i little disapointing,"I love this book...but even the important skaters only got a one page biography written about them. I think that is quite a shame, all else is great though..."
3,"VERY NICE SET, BUT THE CRIB BUMPER IS VERY FLIMSEY","I ACTUALLY OWN BOTH OF THE CARE BEAR CRIB SETS, AND WHILE THIS ONE IS THE BETTER LOOKING OF THE TWO, THIS ONE HAS VERY, VERY LITE PADDING INSIDE OF THE BUMPER PADS. THEREFORE, THE BUMPER DOESN'T STAY IN POSITION. I'M HAVING TO CONSTANTLY STRAIGHTEN IT OUT."
4,HARD TO FIND ACCESSORIES,"THIS IS A COLORFUL SET TO GRAB A BABY'S ATTENTION.HOWEVER IT IS A PROBLEM FINDING ACCESSORIES TO GO WITH THIS BEDDING SET.THEY SHOW A LAMP,VALANCE AND A RUFFLE IN THE PICTURE BUT TO FIND THISIS NOT TO EASY.WAL MART HAS SOME CARE BEARS BUT THE PATTERN IN THE FABRIC IS DIFFERENT."
4,Convincing and Inspiring,This also was part of the box of books series. It was actually quite a bit better than I thought it was going to be. A lot of studies conducted on the ability of Transcendental Meditation to affect bodily change. I have always want to try to be more consistent with this practice and got a fair deal of inspiration.Highlights:1. The books suggest that you can reach a higher state of REM via meditation than just sleep. That sounds so nice!2. The book suggests that various ailments including lactic build-up can be alleviated naturally in the body with just a bid of meditation.3. Heart rate and weight loss can accompany the improved state.4. Mental focus to accomplish large projects such as a thesis are made easier.5. Less deterioration of cells.
4,kept so much papaer,"i couldn't swallow it so that was great. saved a few for the next book i write, the publisher will thank me.buy buy buy! with all your might"
1,Glowing words for very ordinary paper clips,"These are very ordinary, small paper clips. Contrary to the description, they're perfectly smooth with no special gripping power."
3,Didn't work for me,I could not get this to work with my receiver. I have no idea why. I have tried a few different iPods and still cannot figure it out. It just isn't compatible with my receiver. :(
2,Didn't like much about this book at all,"I WAS HOPING FOR A GREAT COZY MYSTERY SET IN HISTORICAL COLONIAL WILLIAMSBURG, VA. THIS BOOK WAS SUCH A DISAPPOINTMENT. THE PRANKS WERE DISGUSTING, THE LANGUAGE VULGAR, SEXUAL CONTENT, NOT NECESSARY. IT'S ALWAYS FUN TO WANT TO REVISIT THE CHARACTERS FROM A BOOK I'VE READ. THERE WAS NOT ONE CHARACTER IN THIS BOOK I WOULD WANT TO REVISIT. I GUESS THE WRITING WAS GOOD - BUT DEFINITELY NOT MY TASTE IN A COZY MYSTERY. I DON'T THINK I'LL BE READING ANYMORE OF TAFFY CANNON'S BOOKS IN THE FUTURE. GIVE ME DOROTHY CANNELL, KATE KINGSBURY, CAROLYN HART AND MANY OTHERS AND I'LL BE HAPPY.SINCERELYDONNA DAVIS"
4,Windharp and sax in perfect balance.,"This is a recording full of totally relaxing moods. A windharp, placed on the windy shores of Norway, form the background of the music. Jan Garbareks sax makes it all a complete experience."
4,Just to set the record straight,"The first ECM release was indeed a Jan Garbarek album, but it was *Afric Pepperbird,* in 1970. *Dis* is Garbarek's seventh album for Herr Eicher and is clearly the beginning of all his subsequent, meditative stylings. Those who like that sort of thing will find this the sort of thing they like."
5,New Insights and Old Traditions,"I love this book! and the many new ways it helps me understand some of the most challenging old stories and the Bible as a whole. Mirkin connects those stories to issues in my own life, but also draws from traditions unfamiliar to me as a Protestant reader. I especially appreciate the passages considering ambiguities in the original Hebrew text."
5,It works,"My tank was expired and had the quick release valve, though my Weber Grill was still going strong. This did the trick, though read the other reviews about keeping the little black plastic assembly piece. It is a must."
3,Good enough,"Unlike the natural gas grill that I purchased and absolutely loved, this item is just ok. It works as it should, but (1) the counter weight system is cumbersome, and leads me to worry that maybe the motor is underpowered, (2) although the spit is plenty long and the grill chamber is big enough to handle at least two birds, the set only includes two stabilizing forks, and (3) the elctric cord is very short."
2,Motor Issues,"I own a Weber Genesis Gold C. I initially thought this rotisserie was a nice product; however the motor began to stop rotating after about the third use. You could hear it trying to turn, but no rotation. It would be an intermittent thing where for no particular reason it would start and stop spinning. This was with and without a load on it. I just default to going out and turning my food (mostly turkey) a quarter turn every 20 minutes and everything is cool. I usually cook small turkeys, 12-14 pounds, so this only requires 5 or 6 rotations. Some of the prices for these things are outrageous! I will not waste money buying a new one, unless I could find one dirt cheap (I paid $65 and that was too much). I'll just use it manually (caveman style)."
5,Weber 9890 Gas Barbecue Rotisserie,This is an additional rotisserie that I purchased for my new Weber grill which is in a different location. The rotisserie is very sturdy and reliable. It is easy to mount and operate. I think it is an exceptional addition to an exceptional gas grill.
3,Works well...when it works,"I have enjoyed using my Weber for rotisserie cooking but since buying my first rotisserie about 8 years ago, I am now having to buy my 3rd motor due to it malfunctioning/burning out. I am surprised that with as nice a grill as it has been, that the motor hasn't lasted longer. I cook on the spit about 8 times a year. Weber was nice enough to replace the first motor at no charge."
1,Nothing of Value in this book,"I personally am a web developer and purchased this book to expand my knowledge, boy that was a mistake. Instead of explaining how to incorporate and fully take advantage of streaming media. This book was filled with a bunch of worthless knowledge about video players that are not even in use and not one chapter explained how to produce quality streaming presentations. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!! it is a waste of time and money."
1,Save your money,"If you like artsy photos and mysterious text, you may enjoy this book. If however you are hoping to learn anything about skilfull manipulation of a sword, or you are looking to read some objective documented research into Japanese history, save your money. This book offers very little of use to any serious martial artist."
4,Kiss arthritis pain goodbye,"I've used regular strength Zostrix for years and have liked the results. This product does the same thing, but faster!"
4,"Excellent ""prep"" tool","I recommend it, however in my experience very few questions presented actually appeared on the test. I used this in conjunction with the Fast Track book for only the essential information and passed almost flawlessly in under 20 minutes on each of the tests. In a nutshell, get it to motivate you to study the heck out of the material, but don't count on any of the questions showing up. Which is a good thing, otherwise everyone would be certified."
3,"Great test questions, disappointing book","The test questions are in depth and accurate. When using the flash cards the answer is accompanied by a reason. You can review and print out questions.I was dissapointed by the book. I was expecting a bigger book. What I got was a 50 page manual describing the objectives of the A+ certification, and how to use the CD, which by the way, has a very small content. (I think it was 66mb.) For the price of the CD and the pamphlet that came with it New Riders has very little invested, but if it makes you pass the test , who cares."
5,Begin is one of the great lost sunshine pop albums of the 60's. Curt Boettcher is a genius,Begin is one of the greatest pop albums of the 1960's. Millennium was the brainchild of producer Curt Boettcher. This album is full of lush melodies that you would expect from Curt. It also includes over the top production you expect from him. But this album takes everything he did a step further and it is one of true masterpieces of the late 1960s. This album is a must for anyone who is fan of Psychedelic pop music. This is Sunshine Pop music at it's best.
5,Some of the best pipe music on CD,"I have had this CD for quite awhile now, and though it does not make the regular rotation in my CD player, it certainly does make in in there every so often. As much as I do like/love the pipe (mostly the drums)one can only take so much on a daily basis. The music on the CD is very well produced, sounds great and is very moving, especially at the end when the band is singing the Minstrel Boy. As a firefighter I appreciate this CD even more and encouage other to give it a try."
2,Too Many Errors,"I record a LOT of CDs using several different computers and burners. The Office Depot CDs have given me the most problems. Often, the computer cannot detect the CD. Sometimes there are errors when burning. I noticed that one pack had a little nick in all of the CDs."
