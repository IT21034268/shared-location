5,The definitive resource on decline of empires,"Paul Kennedy's work should be required reading for high school seniors, and again for college seniors, in order to provide everyone with the historical underpinnings that show why geopolitical struggles take place today as well as why emotions play such a large part in how one group of people relate to another. His work is well-referenced, encyclopedic in scope, and accurate without bias. Having been a student of Dr Eugene Odom, the father of modern ecology, I've had a long-standing interest in how we interact with the world around us, to include how great societies have used natural resources to subjugate those with less might in arms. This book helps to provide a map of how power has shifted over time and how it has transferred resources from conquered areas to the conquerors. I don't know of any other work which comes close to Mr Kennedy's tome."
4,A Book About Historical Cycles,"This is a good book that reveals that there are cycles and trends that tend to have happened throughtout history to great nations.Kennedy discusses a pattern of roughly 500 years from one great culture to another, on the average.His writing, although interesting is somewhat pedantic and scattered.This is a good book for anyone interested in seeing a thread throughout time. Even though the torch has not been passed, who knows when the time for the USA to be yesterdays great power will be, who will take it's place?"
4,"Great fact gathering, but...","I know it's picking nits, but there was one statement that the author made on page 504 saying that ""Stars Wars"" technology would not alter the MAD equation if it were developed. Fact is that the mere threat of Star Wars was the straw that literally broke the Soviet's back. Twelve years later, we still don't have this counter-weapon deployed, but it is perhaps the most powerful political tool since the atom bomb. No one foresaw the end of the ""Evil Empire,"" so you can't take the author to task for that. But he missed the significance of ""Star Wars"" big-time.I wonder if Prof. Kennedy had stretched his towering historical overview back a few more centuries to include the Islamic conquest of much of the West, he would have seen the cyclic rise of religeous fundamentalism as the greatest threat to modern civilization that we are now facing. That's probably more in Paul Johnson's arena..."
1,Boring,"My title says it all - his information is good and covers a wide range of topics, but the book's style makes it very boring to read."
1,dissatisfied,"never received this item. With many e-mails back and forth, TigerDirect admitted to error and re-sent, but they sent wrong item. The price was exactly the same, but I needed the router described above, not an adapter.Amazon did nothing to help resolve the issue. Amazon kept saying item was shipped. UPS had no record of shipping this item. Also, Amazon said over & over to contact TigerDirect.I'm very skeptical about placing a future order with Amazon."
1,Wrong item,I received my order only to find out I had received a different item than what I had ordered. Big mix-up with SKU numbers. Now I have to go through the hassle of returning the item to TigerDirect and waiting for a refund. People at Tiger Direct were very understanding once they figured out what had happened.
1,Misrepresented Product,"I ordered this product from the Amazon site only to have my order cancelled. I emailed the supplier and received the following reply:""The product that you ordered has been incorrectly listed on Amazon. In Amazon the product is listed as the d-link Voip 802.11G 4-PORT Gateway router. Unfortunately, the sku numbers were for a different product.""Someone needs to clean up their data. I doubt that I will ever shop at Amazon again. If you are thinking about ordering this product, you may want to check with Amazon to make sure they have corrected this issue or look somewhere else."
4,"cute, nice, fun","i agree with jaybee's review of this game. ribbit king did outlast warioware in funness. and i love warioware. if you want a nice, fun, cutey, sweet game, this is what you want to play. there are little tinkling sounds whenever a character walks around for pete's sake, like velma footsteps in pup named scooby doo. cant get cuter than that. the golf courses are very imaginitive too, lot of weird obstacles to help or mess up your golf ball."
5,game,This is a great game for kids and adults to enjoy spending time together and having fun. Easy to play game.
5,Works good,"Nice little thermometer, not too big and not too small. Gets the reading very accurately and easy to clean up. Definitely a good tool to have."
3,One fatal flaw,Fast and accurate but will not shut down by itself if you forget to turn it off. This kills the battery and you have to get a new one.
2,Outs Don't Count In This System,"Outs don't count; no league adjustments; no park adjustments. These are ""counting stats"" amalgamated. As such, this might be one of the better counting systems around. You know, in a counting system, longevity is everything. So if you have a lot of hits and runs for many years you do well. I imagine Harold Baines will do very well in this system.Who wouldn't do comparatively well? A productive player who didn't have a lot of longevity and who didn't make a lot of outs while playing in the Astrodome or Dodger Stadium in a strong pitching era.You can bet Jim Wynn, who does well in Bill James' Runs Created system, will rank comparatively low in HEQ.Readers should be aware that this book was roundly skewered on the listserve of the Society for American Baseball Research.My suggestion: don't waste your money. Check it out of the library."
1,A Disappointing Book,"I found much to dislike and little to like about Baseball's Complete Players. It presents a new player evaluation system (called HEQ) that purports to gives fans a simple and accurate idea of a player's overall effectiveness. Unfortunately, I did not find HEQ to be nearly as good as those currently in wide use among baseball fans and researchers. In my opinion, Batting Runs, Runs Created, Extrapolated Runs and Total Player Rating all give fans a much better idea of what a player accomplished on the field than HEQ.I also found the book to be poorly written and very tedious, and I definitely would not recommend this title to another baseball fan."
1,A good idea gone horribly astray,"Many prior authors have developed methods for comparing the performance of very different players. Unfortunately, Mr. Hoban doesn't seem to have learned from any of his predecessors. The methodology which underlies his ratings seems almost random, or else designed to reward some of his favorite players. As analysis, it fails; as simple writing, it's not much better."
1,Not very good,"The system detailed in this book is not very impressive. It ignores much of the groundbreaking work done in the field over the past 25 years. Adding up counting stats, while ignoring the value of these stats and what context these stats were accomplished in, does not make for a very convincing way to rank players. Another problem is the book's insistence on ignoring performance rates, ewhich are vital to understanding any player's production. Overall, there's just very little interesting material here."
5,A Wonderful Reference Book,"In 1998, Alex Rodriguez had the grteatest all-around season by a shortstop in major league history. He is the only shortstop to combine a 700 hitting season with a 400 fielding season. The only other infielder to ever achieve this 700/400 combination was second baseman Rogers Hornsby (who did it twice).This is the sort of intriguing information that you can find in BASEBALL'S COMPLETE PLAYERS. I thoroughly enjoyed the author's attempt to combine both hitting and fielding skills.A must-read for any fan who enjoys comparing the accomplishments of players who played in different eras of the 20th century.Well written and very understandable."
4,"""We're gonna stop Jayhawkin' right now!""","""We're gonna burn Lawrence down to the ground!""I love this album. Songs can be a little sketchy sometimes, but spoken word and story are awesome."
5,Amazing Sibelius Symphonies!!,"""The Complete Symphonies"" captures definitive interpretations of the seven symphonies by the great Finnish composer Jean Sibelius conducted by the late maestro Leonard Bernstein.Each symphony in this 4-disc set is presented in amazing remastered sound quality displaying full dynamic range and sharpness. The beauty of this music is definitely readily apparent from the opening notes through the very end.In addition, the CD booklet includes a brief but highly informative essay in which the history behind each symphony is explained in just enough detail to understand its genesis.All in all, this is a fantastic set of Sibelius's masterful symphonies wonderfully executed by the baton of Mr. Bernstein. Applause also must be given to Sony Music for compiling these symphonies into one complete set. Bravo.It doesn't get much better than this.Highly recommended!!"
2,Not what I'd hoped for.,"I bought this bike on sale at a local sporting goods store for $99. Assembly was pretty easy and the bike seemed fairly sturdy considering the price. Unfortunately there was NO resistance whatsoever. I even tried wrapping a bungee cord tightly around the handle bars; it increased the resistance slightly, but nowhere near what I had hoped for. Within 10 minutes of finishing setting it up, I was taking it apart again to return to the store.Right now I'm shopping for a *real* exercise bike, leaning toward one of the Schwinn models."
1,PIECE OF CRAP!,Do not waste your money. This bike is very loud. You cannot use this if you live in an apartment unless you want to keep your neighbors up. Would not recommend.
1,bad buy,"i cant come up with at least 20 publishable words describing my experience with this item. Repeated words don't count.loud, no resistance, worst purchase ever...throwing it away"
1,Worst Thing On The Face of this Planet,This is the biggest piece of junk I have ever seen in my life. LIke ... not just in the category of bicycles. Its the worst mechanical construction of the universe. I just put it together and then put it directly in the dumpster. I wish I was overexaggerating. PLEASE do not make the mistake of buying this. soooooooooooo bad there are no words to describe
3,"good bike, but the seat hard","I later got a recumbent, but this is a good bike for the money, but the seat is super hard, and if you keep, your buns will pay!"
2,WHERE DID THEY GET THE WRITERS FOR INSTRUCTIONS,The product works fine but putting it tpgether was very difficult. Obviously English is not their native language and it must have written by committee.
2,Not recommended,"If I could do it over again I would buy a different bike. I've had the bike for about 10 months and I can tell you it's VERY loud when you pedal, the fan does not cool you off, the seat is extremely uncomfortable, the handle bars are very awkward and you have to pedal pretty fast to get a good workout because the only resistance is the small fan. I'm saving my money to buy a different bike and tossing this one."
2,Very Noisy,Beware the fan only cools around your ankles & this bike is EXTREMELY Noisy. I am afraid to use this in the morning as I don't want to wake the house. If watching the tv while riding I have to put the tv volume up high in order to hear it clearly over the noise. Assembly can be difficult and the arms are awkward
4,Impressed with Marcy Bike,"When I unpacked the bike I was impressed by the design and the quality of the construction. The instructions were clear and the bike assembled easily. It works great...Runs smoothly and quietly. I'm looking forward to using it daily. If there's a negative it's the seat, it's pretty hard. I've ordered a foam pad."
3,Marcy exercise bike,"I got this exercise bike around christmas it was fairly easy to assembly, didn't take a lot of time. I was mostconcerned with the amount of resistance. During the winter when I can't ride my bike outside this became my bestoption for a work out. However riding 15 to 20 miles on this bike a day(sounds like a lot) I received no work outat all I never even felt winded. I am not a stellar athlete either. Given the choice to do this again I wouldn't. The fact that you can not increase resistance is one of the worse drawbacks, along with the seat beingas hard as a rock."
4,Can give a good workout,"I love this bike. I have worked up to 45 minutes at a time.The lack of resistance is true, but easy to fix. I rotate between working out just my arms and just my legs each day. When exercising my arms, I put my feet on the pedal and apply pressure in the opposite direction....I do the same when exercising my legs. Works fine for me.As for noise. I went to Walgreens and bought a tv wireless headset for 10 dollars. I turn the tv speakers off and just listen through the head set."
3,"Good bike, but has no Resistance!!","I bought this bike to exercise and a bonus, riding it after running on treadmill. Bike is in pretty good quality and easy to ride. But the problem with that is that you CAN'T adjust how soft or how hard to peddle the bike. So really peddling the bike is way too easy and is not much of a workout. It's like riding a bike with no chain or RESISTANCE on it. I mean it has some resistance but not to get a good workout from it, unless you peddle it really fast for a good time. For the seat PEOPLE just put a dang towel on it, it's not as hard as a rock, it has some foam, but not as comfortable. Putting it together was Okay, just took some time. Overall if you have the extra money, try to pay for a bike with Resistance, it's way WORTH IT."
3,tales of blonde tails,"I bought this wig for a theme day while on a family camping trip---""Redneck Day"". It worked perfectly under a straw hat, though I had to tuck the unruly bangs under for it to work without driving me crazy. All-in-all a good addition to my barbecue-rib-munching self..."
5,Up From the Volga,This book was exactly what I was looking for to add to our family heritage/geneology history. My husband's great great grandparents and great grandparents story was told in this book!!
4,good product,"I have used this set before and I know that my skin loved it. But I always buy them from Mary Kay agent which was very pricey. When I saw this set, I crossed my finger for the same quality. It was the same quality but I got the wrong cleanser. Ultimately it was a great purchase for the right price."
3,Not like the old Mary Kay,"I used to sell Mary Kay cosmetics and loved their product, but am disappointed in their NEW products. Not the same."
5,Forever Young,"This is a great prouct at bargain price given its results. It is definately a good bargain for the entire set than buying one by one of the products. I have tried soo many different brands of facial treatment and none completly stopped me from breaking out. I even had a prescription medication that did not work. I decided to try the Mary Kay TimeWise Miracle Set since I love all of Mary Kay's other products. A few weeks after I started using the TimeWise Miracle set, I started to see a difference. Now, a few years since I stared using TimeWise , I don't have breakouts anymore. And my skin looks amazing.I love that they have the normal/dry line. My face is dry and I had problems finding products that did not dry my face out. I recommend the Mary Kay TimeWise Miracle Set to anyone having trouble with breakouts, or to anyone who wants to have younger, healthier looking skin."
5,Great Products,Mary Kay products are the best for my skin ( normal /dry skin) . Highly recommend the product. Arrived on time.
5,INVALUABLE Excellent Resource --- The Warrior Who Killed Custer: Chief Joseph White Bull,"I purchased this book for my Grandfather Murray who is a Custer expert and he was thrilled to receive this book. He found it quoted in another of his Custer Books and as I understand Chief White Bull describes the way his Indians had gone about their lives, what led up to the disaster at Little Big Horn and the tussle between himself, Custer and two other Indian men as Custer was shot. It describes why custer's hand was clenched when he was found, why this came out after White Bull's death and has pictures drawn by White Bull capturing the moment among many other writings paraphrased in other books. If you are a Custer fan this is an INVALUABLE resource as recounted from one of the main men there!"
5,Quality airbrush!,"I bought this airbrush to use for spray tanning (I know, duh, that's what it is for), and am very happy with it. You can tell it is well-made and has a long hose which is handy. It is very comfortable to use and easy to clean with the removable liquid container. There is no splattering and the mist is extremely fine unlike the ones that some professionals have used on me. I am using it with a small 2-gallon air compressor, and be aware that the compressor will cycle on/off quite often as it uses a lot of air when spray tanning. I would think any compressor smaller than 2 gallons would be running constantly."
5,THESE are STEEL TIP DARTS,"These are excellent darts, but BEWARE they are STEEL TIPS. When I bought my Soft tip dartboard they can up as a related product and since nowhere in the ad did they say steel tip I thought they were soft tip...."
5,Can be used anywhere,".Can be used anywhere because it is battery operated (four AA batteries). Not only that, but it is a good feature because with a whole village of these, the electrical cords would be a mess. The downside to this is you have to remember to turn it off before retiring for the night and running the batteries down. However, the kit does include a mount for a bulb if you wish to convert it to 120v."
1,Paid for but never received,I will never buy from this vendor again. I paid for this item and never recieved it. Amazon will not respond to my e-mails.
3,Shut Up and Blow,"I first saw Jeremy on Emeril Live! and was really impressed with his trumpet playing. Of course they don't show much of the musical guests on that show but it caused me to want to hear more. Sad to say, Jeremy has it in his head that he's a singer as well as a trumpet player. He's not. The voice is weak and slightly wobbly. Reminds me of Herb Alpert. His horn playing is MUCH better than his singing. I wish he'd come out with an all instrumental album. Till then, I'll pass."
1,Cheaply made! Horrible,"I bought this for our new son thinking I was getting a great deal, boy was I wrong. First of all the drawers are tiny and it stands as tall as my daughters 4 drawer dresser. The knobs are all plastic and so are the gliders. The drawers also do not have wheels so it does not ""glide"" as stated at all. There is also only a half back and the whole thing is very unstable. I am very dissatisfied and would suggest noone else buy this product!!!"
3,You Get What You Pay For,"Not very high quality. Filmsy. There aren't any metal tracks for the drawers so they don't slide well. Also, the drawers are super shallow.The assembly takes a fair amount of time as well.Honestly, buy your furniture at Target instead. It's about the same price and WAYYYY better quality."
1,Terrible,This produc is the worst i have ever bought off amazon. the reason why i say this is because all of the wood peices to put togetherwere cracked my boyfriend litterally had to get some wood glue to seal the cracks i would have sent it back but because i had a babydue that week i really needed it! Another person thats buys this product may have good luck but i didnt but its nice
4,well made for a child's room,"This dresser is for my daughter. It wasn't too hard to put together and it works wonderfully.. haven't had any issues with loosening drawers or anything breaking, and it hold all her little clothes!!"
2,IT IS OK I GUSS,"This DVD about Joss is ok. He was funny like always! BUT it just seems like they couldn't got this DVD together fast enough. The sound was kind of bad. They could of done a better job with the menu too. Could of had alittle more with Joss or the cast of the shows. But if you like Joss Whedon like I do, then buy this dvd. My favoite part was when he talks about how the movies writers get treating more badly then TV once, wicth if you saw the x-men inturveiw whim Summer Glau then you know that is tru."
1,Not a quality product,This thermometer is very cheaply made. It feels flimsy and the magnets on the back won't hold it secure on a metal surface.
2,Good for a while...,"...but died after a few months. Be careful about getting the probe wet, it will cause the rest to malfunction."
1,"Not built to last, not even built to use","We only need a very simple device to take simple read of temperature. This one seems like a good option, price is just right and has all the function we need. The first day I got it, did a simple test, boiling water read out at 100C/212F(~), which seems just right. And the next a few days, most of the time it functioned as supposed to, however, I can tell the error increased. Yesterday, about 1 week from the 1st use, we calibrated again using boiling water, the readout was 110 C/2xx F. Something was wrong, but still it was close. And today, it just became ridiculous, the room temperature water measured at 81 C/ 180 F. It just not getting better."
3,Digital thermometer review,It was easy to figure out and easy to use. The timer works great. The thermometer on mine was not accurate. I did not like the fact that it waits 30 seconds to start sounding the alert for the temp I had set.
1,"Works, for awhile anyway","First one lasted for a few uses then began to read about 40 degrees high. I sent it back and it was promptly replaced under warranty. The second one has begun to do the same thing. It's showing 200+ degrees right now on the workbench in the cold garage. It costs $5.00 to send the thing back, how many times do you do that with a $20 thermometer?"
2,Probably Defective,"I never actually got to use mine because as I was trying it out I noticed that the one I received appeared to be defective. When I would press the buttons (which seemed very flimsy to begin with) I would often have to press them multiple times to get a response. Aside from that the design of the unit has to be the most complicated timer ever created. Yes it has a lot of functions which is nice, but most people will never figure out the majority of the basic functions without thoroughly reading through the manual. I am returning this unit, and will likely purchase a different model in it's place."
4,all-ice music,"from CD Roots: The second recording of ""all ice"" music from the Norwegian percussionist, this time joined by Per Jrgensen on vocal and ice trumpe, with Isungset on ice percussion, icehorn and isofon. Absolutely unique; beautiful, surprising and highly recommended."
3,"Great subject matter, art could use some work","I don't really have a big issue with this book... it's a nice addition to our kids' library and helps to show families that don't usually make it into children's books. My only problem is with the depiction of the gay dads in the book... for whatever reason, the illustrator has chosen to show just about every one as a stereotypical queen. Thin, wispy moustaches, pinky fingers splayed to the side, effeminate poses. Something about it bugs me. I'm all for representing diversity, but the illustrator seems to have a pretty singular vision of gay men. The lesbian moms, on the other hand, are well drawn and aren't all uniform in appearance. If this book had some dads that didn't appear to be taken from some anti-gay propaganda book, I'd give it 5 stars."
2,Atonal scream,"I love to hear the great screamers: James Brown, Wilson Pickett, and Bobby Bland, to name a few. Contrarily, Mighty Clouds' lead, Joe Ligons, may have the most annoying and atonal scream outside heavy metal. Pass on this one."
4,Haunting melodies,"Listening to this album is like going back in time when everything about music seemed so simple yet so advanced. This album, with it's baroque and haunting melodies shows how talented and skillful Steve Hackett was and still is! By no doubt, it's Hackett's finest solo album. Any fans of Genesis's Wind and Wuthering outhere?Cheers, enjoy."
2,Damaged Goods,"The package arrived and looked good. The shipping packaging appeared adequate. I opened the package, and the CD looked new. Cellaphane was intact. I unwrapped the cellaphane and removed the outer jacket. The plastic case was cracked. This may seem minor, but I bought the cd knowing the artist would be signing it in less than a week. I was stuck. No time to exchange it. Seems like there must be a handling problem somewhere in the process."
4,Nice countdown timer,"I like it, and can recommend getting it, but improvements for me would be:a larger displaya larger angle back by which it sits on the easel (would make it easier to see the display when sitting on desk)Start/Stop button on the rightsomething on the sliding switch to make it easier to move, and have more definite clicks when it is in place*** update, a bettter idea ****** get rid of the sliding switch, and put on another button under T1 - the Mode button ****** buttons should be in this order from left to right: Mode, Clear, Enter, Start/Stopmaybe use an AA battery, do the button batteries last longer?***************************11/29/10I'm going to try the Control Company's Traceable Four-Channel Alarm Timer (5004)Krackeler Scientific has a nice selection also"
5,Have to have one of these!!,"I have purchased many of these timers over the last 45 years. I have several of them around the house and use them for wake-up alarms. I can be cooking/baking several things at a time and know when to tend to them with this timer. Excellent product. If the battery door snaps off, call the manufacturer and they'll send one."
1,Didn't get a working unit,"Ordered one which didn't work (no display), then received a replacement unit which was also nonfunctional. Perhaps a battery shelf life issue? Timely replacement and good customer service from Amazon, but I certainly wouldn't order another one of these."
4,Good timer,"If you have to get a timer, get this one. Pros: It is a four channel timer, you can count up or down simultaneously, it has memory for 4 preset times, it is small and portable yet sturdy. Cons: Setting the times is by pressing whatever minutes you need, it is not very loud so it can go unnoticed if you don't have it close or if you are watching tv or playing music. My favorite part is the memory function, to avoid setting the times, I set the timer at 5, 7, 10 and 20 since I use it in the kitchen, and then I can make combinations of longer times. I wish the beeps were different for each channel but overall it is a good product."
3,Does What It's Supposed to Do,"This timer does what it's supposed to do, except the beeper is way too weak. You almost have to be on top of it to hear it go off. Other than that, it's okay."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,I was very disappointed to recieve my product that didn't work. We tried changing the batteries but still no luck. Don't waste your money. The shipping is expensive. I give it a NO STAR RATING.
2,"Not large enough, dimensions given are for packaging!","We wanted a large timer. The picture looks like it is a small timer (and it is), however the dimensions given in the Amazon description indicated that it is 4"" X 6"" which would be great for our needs. When it arrived, we were very disappointed since the dimensions given are for the full package, not the small timer inside. The screen/numerals are even smaller than in many other similar timers.This is not an evaluation of the timer electronics or features other than the screen size."
5,Awesome assistant for any project,"I had one of these for years when something in the battery compartment didn't fit snug anymore. After finding it again online at Kitchen Kaboodle for 19.95 including shipping, I am back on track!"
5,A great little timer,I purchased the CDN PT1A Digital Timer/Clock 4 Event Programmable as a replacement for a virtually identical Pyrex 4 event timer now discountinued. I also own two triple event timers from other manufacturers; this one is easier to use an more reliable. I am a personal chef so I have a CDN PT1A Digital Timer/Clock 4 Event Programmable in my kitchen at home and one in my cook day kit for use in my clients' homes. What a handy little timer. You won't regret your purchase.Supper Wizard
3,DON'T DROP!,"Timer worked well...had no complaints...enjoyed ability to time several things at one time; however, knocked off kitchen counter by accident and now will not work at all. Although I try not to intentionally drop things, in the kitchen things do get dropped and I cannot believe that it stopped working entirely. This never happened with a timer before!"
1,"Dead battery on arrival, couldn't open to replace","Others here have complained that they couldn't open the battery compartment--I had the exact same problem. But since I just bought it, I shouldn't have to replace the battery anyway. I returned it to Amazon."
5,Love this timer - it does everything well,"I found a timer like this many years ago and have never been able to find another - until now! It has programmable time, count up, count down, is easy to work, and each timer has its own special beep so you can know what's ""ready"" by the sound. The numbers are a little small, but I'm willing to forgive it for this one tiny indiscretion."
1,Has a few problesm,"The problems I have were all user interface issues and while all small build up to using a different timer.* Buttons are not easy to press, I have often have had to press twice.* Slide switch on side must be positioned carefully to get it to right setting. If not exactly on mark it will display the clock instead.* After count down is over and the start/stop button is pressed the timer does not reset to the time just run. This is critical when time several 30 sec events in a row. It is too time consuming to enter in 30 secs time 30 secs and enter 30 secs.It was dropped twice from chest height and broke in the first month."
3,Multi-function timer,"This timer has many usefull functions. It tells time, counts up and down, and offers 4 programable timing options. Unfortunately, the buttons are difficult to push, and sometimes get stuck, making it difficult to program. Also, the slide bar function selector doesn't always work, making it difficult to tell if you have succeeded in programming your timer.It's still more useful than an egg timer, but not as much as a previous timer, which had the problem with the button edges getting stuck on the edges of the holes they are in when you try to push them, but not the slide bar issue.Try a different brand, but the same style of timer."
1,Broke first week,"I got this timer to replace my Westbend 3 event timer which I have have for years and love. Too bad they don't make that model anymore. But, the button contacts are wearing lose. I had this timer for a week, it has a lot of functionality but the slider used to change between Count Down, Count Up, Program Timer and Clock seems flimsy and cheap. Well, true to form, when I slide it back to Count Down, which is the function I use most often, it would only give me Count Up.... Try after Try, no luck. It seems like it would be a great timer with lots of functions, but reliability does not seem to be one of them."
3,good timer but a very quiet ring,"This timer works very well and is very versatile. However, what I wish I had known before purchasing (and what would have kept me from buying it) is that the ""ringer"" is very soft and high pitched. My old timer was great as I could hear it from almost anywhere in the house. This ring is so soft that I can usually only hear it in the room where it is located. My husband, who has some hearing loss, cannot hear it even then."
1,Avoid CDN if you can help it,"I've owned a few of these over the years, and am always appalled at how easily, quickly and frequently they break. That's true for both this item and the timer/thermometer. Why did I ever buy more than one? Mostly because they're ubiquitous, but also because they're cheap. Guess you get what you pay for in this market. I'm now swearing off CDN forever."
1,Didn't work.,"The battery door didn't open easily or close securely once we opened it and inserted the battery. Although we read the instructions and followed them, we could not make this timer work. The numbers never showed in the windows. Returned to Amazon."
2,Very bad timer!,"The slide button to select the mode is very finicky. It is hard to get it into certain modes. Also, two times recently it started counting up without beeping after finishing counting down! I almost burned my cake! I threw it out immediately. Piece of junk!"
1,Poor Quality,"The slide switch broke after about six months of normal use. For my kitchen, ""normal"" use for this item means once or twice during the week and several times over each weekend. I find this particularly odd because I simply left the slide switch in one position, so it certainly did not wear out from overuse. When the timer stopped working, I thought the battery had died, but it turned out that the if I moved the switch to a different position I could (barely and erratically) get the timer to work, but not in the multi-timer mode."
3,didn't work,This was suppose to fit my trucks wheels but didn't. They were nice quality and all but was disappointed that I couldn't use them
5,Hugo Boss Women's Oversized Maxx Bracelet Watch #HB.38081108.6711,Wound up sending it back because it was too big and heavy. It was however a beautiful watch BUT very mannish.
4,Border Town,"Although the basis of the plot line has been used before this movie had its own originality and was action packed. Great acting and character development. Loved this movie, and you will too. Check it out"
3,"Dolls homely, techniques helpful","These dolls are not my style, but the lessons are good and progressive. I will apply them to other types of dolls. She even shows you how to make your own shoes to fit any dolls. One tip that she gives I disagree with; she makes fingered dolls by placing a folded pipe cleaner in each finger, which makes the hands look elongated. A more natural hand is made by making the hand then using small running stitches on the outside."
2,Disappointed,"I had hoped for a far more detailed approach to doll making and this didn't deliver -- for the price, I regret having bought it."
5,Fourth Installment for Tex,"This the fourth installment of Tex Murphy, P.I. After seeing him in his real light in Under a Killing Moon, this time you will help him discover the top secrets of 20th century. With 3 different narrative paths, 7 different endings, better graphics and story, you'll encounter many puzzles and you'll see some better known actors such as Barry Corbin, Tanya Roberts, Kevin McCarthy and John Agar. You'll be able to choose whether you wish to sweep through the story, or to pick the more challenging path with more puzzles to solve, and points as a reward."
4,Almost as good as Year Of The Cat,"Always liked this album, I only wish they had smoothed out and cleaned up the refrains and instrumentals in places! Those things tended to just clutter up what could have been as good as ""Year Of The Cat""! There was nothing overdone in that marvelous album! Still this a great album."
2,good for time,"We were tired of our cheaper cordless phones not working well or the specific battery was too hard to find and replace, so went for a more expensive and higher GHz model and chose the Vtech (bought the two handset pack). Worked really well for about a year (NYC prewar building), good reception, great range, no interference, nice features, loved the ability to easily replace the rechargeable AAA batteries.Then one of the hand sets slowly started to die. Bad reception regardless of battery life or quality, screen started to go a few pixels at a time, finally threw it out and went with one handset. Now about two and a half years later I'm shopping for a new cordless phone as the other handset is going the same way...rings only once....bad static....cuts out....pixels on the screen about half gone now.Loved them while they worked...just didn't last with moderate use."
5,Great product,"Ordered two of these handsets to replace my older handsets @ about4 years old. They worked perfectly and should keep my vonage system up and running for another 4 years. The phone system is great, has all the features you need, so if you have a base and need to replace the handsets this is the way to go. Refurbished very well, they were in excellent shape, look and work as good as new ones.BTW to un-register the old handests, power off the base and power it back on while holding down the page button till boot up is complete (light turns green).To register handsets, hold select/menu button on handset till prompted for the base code, enter base code from the sticker on the bottom of the base."
4,VTech internet phone,"This product is very good. I have used this item for over two years now and will continue to do so. The only thing I wish could happen is for VTech to think about selling the base charger separate because the one I had got a short in the cord, which caused my phone not to charge. I had to buy the whole item which was the charger & the phone, which I didn't need. So now I have two phones and one charger. Overall, this item is a great buy and I would recommend this item to anyone that may be looking for a reliable phone that can be used with Vonage service."
2,"Very Basic, OK as a very introductory outline","Ok as an introductory retail book, if you are looking for very basic, high level information. Definitely lacking if you are looking to get into some of the more 'current state of the art' trends and details."
4,what i needed,"this item was shipped pretty quickly, packaged appropriately, and in the condition described. i was satisfied."
4,Retailing Textbook,"Book arrived in new condition. One complaint, it didn't come with some sort of reciept or proof of purchase. Couldn't beat the price though and it arrived right on time."
1,Sad,"If this book really does cost what it says it does, then the editorial review is less than useless. It's sad. Hey, I understand your stock prices are dropping, but don't start loosing the quality."
3,Only average Nielsen,"The Nielsen series conducted by Schonwandt features some passionate, energetic performances, but this particular CD would not be my first choice for these works. The relative simplicity and clarity of the 1st symphony is muddled by rather heavy-handed overinterpreting, and it also lacks the clarity of rhythym and texture that others bring to the work."
3,"Blues falling down like rain, my review from Barcelona 2,5 stars","After attentively listening to this record several times I'm still a little disappointed as it doesn't stand comparison with what 'Kenny Neal' is capable of carrying out and has carried out before, as for instance his extensive discography in Alligátor label. I think that the change of label has brought out a decrease in his recording quality and this can be felt in covers like ""Big Boss Man"", ""My Babe"", ""The Things I Used To do"" or ""I' m Ready"". In addition, instrumentally this record is not in a par with his previous recordings. More criticisms could be raised against this record, but it is fair to say that in general it is not bad at all even if it is one or two levels lower than Neal's usual standard. I give it 2.5 stars"
3,Sicne amazon didn't provide an editorial review....,"From the back cover: All she wanted under her Christmas tree is this man! Joe Hughes. He's gorgeous, strong, passionate...with the kind of intensely private quality that's a challenge to any self-respecting woman. Not that Teresa really needs another challenge in her life. She's just moved to a small town in Washington and while her young son thinks it's cool, her teenage daughter hates the place. Worse, although Teresa's a darn good vet, the local farmers won't let her tret their livestock.Still, Teresa can't resist loving Joe even when she learns that Joe's keeping a secret that threatens her happiness, and his own...I'll add my thoughts after I read it."
3,good at first,"this box set was okay. it starts off with 9 tails naruto vs orochimaru. then it gets boring for a good while. it only gets good again when they actualy fiind sasuke. but other then that 90% of this box set is naruto, sakura, yamato and sai running around looking for sasuke. i personal feel these episodes are the kind you can see once and never need to see them again. i mostly didnt like it cause sakura, yamato and sai are by far the least memorable characters in the series. sakuras sakura, yamato has no story and boring wood moves with a boring look to match. and sai...well sai is arguably the most useless, boring, emotionless character in the series. other then that its cannon so get it if your collecting. or if youre like me and not a collector and only get ones with alot of action then skip this one."
2,need more info,I'm a little concerned that this might not be a complete season. I mean I'm aware that it says complete but does it have 32 episodes starting with the episode Homecoming all the way up to The Return of Kazekage ???? because the front of the box says box 4. I would like to see a picture of the back of the box before I spend any money on it.
1,Failing grade,"No darn good. On three attempts it caused me to way overcook the meat. Just doesn't register correct temperatures, the minimum performance we expect out of a thermometer.I threw it away."
1,useless,I only used this a few times before the readout started to bounce back and forth between a temperature and some strange figures that look like parts of letters. I don't have any idea what is wrong with it or how to repair it.
1,dinky,"I used it a few times, but with no auto s***off, it will kill the battery.The plastic battery cover quickly broke.I hate plastic where metal should have been used.It's dinky junk."
1,Not Great,This is the first digital thermometer that I have purchased and I am not really impressed. This thing is NOT instant...it takes about 15~30 seconds to read. Get an analog model for a fraction of the cost instead.
4,"Nice, except...","I love this as a footrest, and it's the best one I've tried (and I've tried many). But, the edges are WAY too sharp and scratched up the bottom of my antique wooden desk. I wrapped the edges with duct tape, which works, but then it looks terrible, and it's not pretty to begin with."
4,Love it.,"This product is just what I was seeking: sturdy, height-adjustable, flexible tilt. Height adjust requires no tools and holds its position. Large surface area accommodates a variety of body sizes. It's pricey but worth it. Planning to get a second one for home."
4,Excellent product,"The 3 M Foot Rest is ugly. However, this doesn't really matter much considering that it fits under a desk. What matters is its comfort, ease of adjustment and sturdiness. People with back or knee issues will, find this foot rest to work very well in terms of these criteria. I especially like the ease of adjustment and the ability to rock the footrest forward and back with my feet -- this helps me stretch out my calves and maintain flexibility in my arthritic knee.The price is right too -- very reasonable considering the sturdiness of the product.I strongly recommend this product. As long as you're not looking for aesthetic pleasure, it is a winner."
3,"Eh... ok, but not recommended","I feel somewhat mixed about this product. For what it is supposed to do, it does it. Your feet are in a good ergonomic position. It comes all in one piece so there's no assembly. I can't recommend it for a few reasons, which are probably more personal preference, but worth mentioning. 1. It is steel - I don't know about you, but all my computer's electrical wires and plugs are under my desk. I just don't like the idea of mixing steel in an area of electricity. 2. It has a rough top to it. That's not a problem if you have it for work, but for home, it doesn't feel great barefoot or in socks. 3. It looks industrial. Probably nit picking, but aesetically it is lacking. I wouldn't recommend it, but that's just my two cents."
2,I hope that I can still return it,This foot rest is sharp on its edge. Once it cuts my feet and that hurts. I wish I could return it to Amazon.
3,Not very comfortable but built well,"This is an extremely well built item. Not only does it look professional, it feels that way. However, for an average sized person, this is really not useful, actually hurt my back a bit putting my feet on them for an extended period of time. However, it was useful for someone who doesn't have the longest legs."
3,Well Built,"It supports my feet while I work. Solidly built, My feet are on it while I am typing this. What more is there to say about a foot rest."
1,Dangerous,"My husband is self-employed here at our home and was in a better position to test this item than I was, as I have to have my legs propped up at all times while sitting. Well he tried it out and felt it to be a very dangerous item as it got in the way and was easy to trip over, etc. Adjusting it for your own particular needs, he also felt to be complex and too difficult for someone sitting in a regular office without all the tools that he has handy. I'm not sure what he did with it, but it sure isn't under his feet."
4,"Still golden, despite sonic flaws","To hear the mind of Bill Evans playing against the mind of Bill Evans is always extraordinary. Many of his middle-period Verve recordings suffer from a ""boxy"" and often tinny piano sound, but getting deeper inside what he did with harmonic possibilities is always an adventure. This is one of the least successful engineered Verve recordings, and their reissue doesn't help much, but he's just so damn good, I've learned to live with it, and just immerse myself in those rich chords and flowing lines. Those who want to hear EXQUISITE-SOUNDING Evans overdubbing himself, with clarity and no tape noise, check out his Warner Bros' 1978 album ""New Conversations""!"
3,I wouldn't be that strict,"Yes, technical drawbacks are obvious, but after all - this is Bill Evans... I don't quite like the idea of this overdubbed records, but as a real Bill Evans fan I'd go for this record as well"
4,2 years on and still going strong!,"I have been using the CDN TM14-S Digital Timer in my classroom for over 2 years now and I am pleased to say it is still in working order. The students did managed to peal the magnetic strip off the back after a few months. This is not to say the magnet was not adequately applied, but to share the fact that middle school students can be destructive and this is the only damage they managed to do to the device in 2 years. If you are looking for a light, inexpensive, reliable timer with easy to use buttons and an easy to read display, this may be the produce you are looking for."
2,Don't put it in your pocket!,"Because pressing the two raised buttons simultaneously resets the timer, you can't carry this around with you in a pocket (say while exercising, or doing yardwork, or cooking) -- it's too easy to lean ever so slightly on the two buttons and reset the timer without even realizing it. The buttons should have been recessed so it would be easy to press them simultaneously intentionally but difficult by accident.Otherwise it's OK (so far -- have only had it a month and hoping it lasts longer than the junky TR3 by the same company). There are surprisingly few minute & second count down timers on the market, so this may be the best inexpensive one available."
2,Not the best,As far as licorice goes this one is just so so. If you love real licorice buy RJ's that in my opinion is by far the best there is. This one has great texture and a good initial taste but then a strange bitter note like that of blackstrap molasses hits your tongue and a an unpleasant sulpfur after taste that lingers. It is too sweet and almost more of an anise flavor then real pure licorice. I don't know whats in it it came in a clear bag twist tied from a health food store locally. If you love blackstrap you may like it. I much prefer RJ's it is all natural and much better in both texture and pure real licorice root flavor. I like Panda brand for flavor too but not texture. I would not buy Kookaburra brand again.
3,Just ok.,I was looking for black licorice that was more like the real Australian licorice. This was better than Twizzlers but not the same as Australian made.
4,Molasses overpowering,"This isn't a bad candy, if you like a real strong molasses taste, but I can barely taste the licorice for the molasses. I wouldn't call it a good licorice candy."
5,"Kookaburra Australian Licorice,","I find that this licorice, is one of the most delicious that I have had in many years. The only thing that ever came close to this when I remember buying it back in the 1950s which was produced by a different company. The only drawback that I see is that I think it's quite expensive. As I figured each 16 ounce bag comes to about $10.50 each I myself purchased four of those bags. And of course let's not forget the shipping that is not included. I think in the future I'm going to look for a company that sells in larger quantities, because sometimes it's cheaper to buy in bulk as opposed to little individual bags, and also many times shipping is included."
3,licorice from Australia,"It tasted good, but was not as soft as some I had tasted on a friend's home. I'd like the packages to be smaller in size."
5,Absolutely Delicious!,"This licorice was really delicious - a must for all true black licorice lovers! It was soft and chewy but not sticky. The flavor is very strong with a pleasant, lingering after-taste. The licorice arrived in an unlabelled plastic bag, but the bag was clean (unlike what another reviewer received), and the product arrived four days after I ordered it. I will definitely be ordering Kookaburra licorice again!"
1,disapointing,"This stuff was not rediculously expensive, but it was expensive enough. I expected that real gormet.. I wasn't thrilled.. didn't taste very strong and it was way too soft.. haribo's licorice wheels are much better."
5,"Blendtec TB-621-20 Total Blender, Black",I like its action of grasping all the ingredients by its own action and blending them. I had wanted the larger jar which I thought I was getting when I ordered it. That one came with the 4 inch blade. I did recommend it to someone and she bought one also. She bought the one with the larger jar. It is a great addition to my kitchen.
5,Love it!,Works Great! We highly recommend it. Love that you don't loose all the fiber like you do with some other juicers.
1,Disappointed,"I don't normally complain, but this unit is not worthy of its price. Our Blendtec's jar washer assembly failed after 3 years of very sporadic use. The washer now leaks, and worst of all, comes apart in our drinks. I called customer service, they said it's out of warranty and would cost $60 for a new jar with shipping. I should have shopped at WalMart for a cheap blender. I definitely would not buy this again or recommend it to anyone.2/8/12 update ... Went out and bought a Vitamix about a year ago. Runs circles around Blendtec ... no kidding!"
3,"Great Blender, Not the best lid.","This blender is one of the finest you can purchase. However, the lid that this model comes with has a small hole in the top, just large enough to make quite a mess. You can buy a new jar with the clear center in the lid for about $60 and it's well worth it to upgrade."
3,Not a 3 HP blender,"This blender works out fine but for those who would want to purchase a 3 HP blender, this is NOT the one. The description here is kinda misleading."
1,can't even hold water,opend up put in water hit button and it leaked cheap top. most dissapointing 400.00 item i ever bought. cheap plastic
4,Very strong blender,I was hesitant when I saw the price of this blender. But it's worked perfectly now for over a year and I'm happy. It is very strong and blends anything you throw in it. Sometimes an air bubble will be created when you don't have enough liquid in the blender along with ice or frozen fruit but that is quickly cured by adding just a little more water or what ever. I love this and have at lease one smoothie a day or more. I've made ice cream in it too. Highly recommend. Four stars because of that air bubble I mentioned above.
1,Died after 1 day,"I cannot believe it! I purchased this blender from costco yesterday, used it 10 times so far and this morning while making a smoothie it completely died. I do believe it was a fluke, though. But I just want to make sure I logged this in case it happens to anyone else. I am going to get a new one from costco today but if it happens again I will definitely switch to the vitamix."
5,Blendtec Fun,I bought my blendtec about two months ago on a whim without too much research. I have been having fun everyday trying something new. I mostly do a protein shake or fruit juice in the morning and the texture and flavors are great. I have also used it many times to make my own pie crust and have been pleased with the result. Last week we had friends over and everyone helped make salsa and drinks in the blender. What a hoot. It is a great blender with lots of possibilities. I am glad I own one.
5,I'm in Love with my Blender,"I did a lot of research before choosing this blender. I love this blender. It has changed my daily routine. I use it almost every day. Sometimes several times a day. You can do so many things with it. My favorite is to make juices and smoothies. I love that I can get more nutrition with this blender than a juicer because it keeps in all the healthy fiber! Although for some vegetables, it wouldn't be so bad to have a juicer as well, sometimes its a little too much fiber. I definitely eat more fruits and veggies now that I have this blender. It's powerful (although once I had to send it back to the manufacturer after 6 months to get fixed, this was free except for the shipping, it's now back to full speed again). It's nice when you blend things and don't find chunks in the final product. I like the different cycles. I like that it turns off automatically. I like that it lifts off the motor easily. So many great things if I don't stop now I may be writing all day."
5,The Best blender on Earth!!,There is really not much to say here. This Blendtec blender meets and exceeded all my expectations. I was thinking about purchasing a VitaMix blender but chose this one because of its unstoppable gears:)A MUST buy!!
5,Blendtec Review,"Excellent product! Used for smoothies and dinner prep. Wife bugged me to purchase and due to the high cost slowed my buying decision. However, great investment and this will be the last blender that we purchase - It is a stout machine and does an outstanding job. Good investment and a happy wife!"
3,blentec,"This blender will not come close to a vita mix. I have had both for several years, you will need to repacce the jars too often at your expense. poor bearing desizn. vitamix blender bottles have a better design. To mix a smoothie a kitchen aid will work for less."
5,what is the volt of it?,"I have a doubt regarding this product. I would like to know if it's 220 or 110 volts. Please could you verify it and let me know, wheter it's 110 or 220 volts?"
5,It's Amazing!!!,"I've had the BlendTec for about a month now and I really like it. I make a quart of green smoothies every morning and this blender is great for that. They come out nice and smooth and no big globs of anything. I'm starting to get adventurous, as you can make sauces and soups in it as well. The recipe book is great and gives you some awesome recipes, especially if you are looking to be more health conscience. I would recommend this product to anyone. It will pay for itself in no time."
4,Blendtec Home TB-621-BHM,"I really love this thing, but it has problem with cold things, such as ice, and frozen items. I've blended a ton of things in this, especially smoothies and it works great as long as there is some liquid in there. I've tried it on multiple settings but it seems that cold items will stick to the walls and are pushed up so that you have to push the mix down and once there is some luquid consistency then gravity pulls it down into the blend area. It's still great, but not perfect!"
1,Died after 8 months!,"I bought the Blendtec TB-621-20 Total Blender, Black in May 2012 and it broke just now, right in the middle of a smoothie. I use this blender maybe 4-5 times a week, not even every day, and it has died just eight months after I dropped $400+ dollars. I have just written an e-mail to the company to find out about a warranty or what they can do to fix this. Before this unexpected and very disappointing failure, I would have given it 4 stars."
1,Blendtec total blender going nowhere,"Unfortunately, disappointing product. The inside plastic got scratched from blending frozen mango pieces, so presumably plastic in drink. When making a berry shake with yogurt and frozen berries and small ice cubes, rotors unable to blend. A lot of noise and very little happening."
1,WARNING! PIECE OF GARBAGE!,"This will rate as one of the all time worst purchases I have ever made. I turned on the ""Blendtec"" blender with the ingredients Ive used for months and in two minutes the blender promptly shut off! In less than a few minutes, a brand new blender BURNED OUT! I COULDNT BELIEVE IT!WHATEVER YOU DO, DO NOT MAKE MY MISTAKE! DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! BUY AN OSTERIZER! It lasts for many years!"
5,Awesome blender,"Perfect blender. Just dump the stuff in, push a button, and let it do its job. A little loud but what do you expect with 1,500 watts of power? If sound is really an issue, upgrade to the commercial one and go for the Q-series."
2,Blendtech Fourside Jar,"The motor is powerful, but the blade bearing and the rubber seal could not prolong the 13am motor resulting liquid leaks at bottom of the jar. My jar leaking black metallic liquid smell inside the jar contaminated my smoothly. You can test your jar by filling the jar with clear water just enough to cover the blade, close the jar and press the smoothly button, observe bottom of jar for leak and check if the water changed color.Jar replacement cost $79.00 + shipping the new jar come with 3 years warranty. Some customer in the Web still getting leaks after replaced of a new jar with upgraded bearing. I will test for leaks before use to make sure I'm not drinking a contaminated smoothly."
5,Best bender ever,My wife has a smoothie almost every day and we have gone through 4 blenders in the last 4 years. Each one was more expensive than the last. They all burned out in less than a year. The Blentec works as advertised. It is quick but loud. It has more power than any blender I have ever seen and I expect it to last for a very long time. Cost is the only big negative.
3,spare part killer,blender's great and does most of the things they claim but when it breaks down boy do you have to spend.I have to replace my jar and will cost me 60 something dollars plus $18 for shipping.Still debating if I should do this or just buy a new cheaper machine.
1,Bad deal,"651 uses, now dead. Jar wore out at about 500 uses. The square jar sucks, don't buy any unit that doesn't come with the wildside jar.Frankly, with these jars wearing out so fast and at these prices, Blendtec should offer a lifetime warranty on the machine just to get us to keep buying jars."
5,My Blendtec...,"I use my Blendtec every other day to make fruit smoothies... I was impressed with how much power it has to chop up the frozen fruit, knowing that the blades don't seen to be very sharp. Very easy to clean... Be careful when your cleaning it to be sure the cover is on tight (or hold it down) I neglected to do so and the results, were soapy water all over the kitchen..."
5,I love my blender! <3,"I purchased 3 of them in total. I got the first one for my parents to make healthy veggie-fruit-nut juice. Soon, my sister and I got our own blendtec, exactly the same one! It's very easy and fast to make juice in the mornings, afternoons, and at nights. We are not only using it to make juice. I also use it to make creamy pumpkin soup! Yum! Oh, and soy milk!!I have owned this product for over a year now. So far, I'm still loving it!The only complant I have is they make loud noise when it's blending.I would recommend this blendtec to everyone!!!"
2,Mine just died,I have had my Blendtec for a little over two years and it just quit working this week. It's been a great blender but I expect something that expensive to last a long time. Hopefully I still have the reciept for the waranty. I am about to find out if they stand behind thier product.
5,Best Blender Ever!,"I was hesitant about paying this much for a blender. I did try other blenders, but there were always chunks when I made smoothies and trying to crush ice was usually a joke. I bought the Blendtec and I am very happy I did. I've owned the Blendtec for almost 2 years and I use it constantly. I make 2-3 smoothies a week, protein shakes, milk shakes and I just started making ice cream. It does all those great. The only problem is that every now and then you have to shake the jar to get the fruits sitting on top down into the blades. Small sacrafice to make for an excellent blender. I hear the Vitamix is just as good, but the Blendtec is compact and doesn't take up as much space on the counter."
4,QA Concerns,The blender arrived from Amazon on time. At its first use the on-off switch was not working properly. It would start the blender intermittantly and had to be held by hand in a specific range to keep the unit working. The unit was returned to the mfr. (at our expense for shipping). We have heard nothing back from the Blendtec repair shop since we sent the unit back ten days ago. I have concerns about the mfr. QA review of products before they are packaged and their service responses.
4,Just a step below Vitamix,"I initially purchased the Blendtec to start with my new smoothie diet. I made great smoothies and I was very satisfied with it. Then I got my hands around a Vitamix 5200 and I got similar results as far as smoothies go ( I would have probably failed to tell the difference blind testing the results from the two ) The difference that I notices was the noise level and quality of construction. The Vitamix was a bit quieter in both slower and higher speeds. The Vitamix also feels sturdier and heavier duty.The Blendtec, however, had an edge in features since you can set up a cycle and not have to make manual adjustments during the blending.The Blendtec also beats the Vitamix in the price."
4,Blendtec total blender,"Overall very good blender. Not sure if it really justifies $400 price. There are at least a few other blenders in $ 200-300 price range that work really well.However, my wife has been ogling this blender for a while and I guess her happy smile is worth the extra $150."
3,Not that great,I purchased the Blendtec and although it has a powerful motor I found myself using the settings 4-5 times in order to make one smoothie with frozen fruit and juice. I had plenty of juice in the jar and it kept mixing it on the bottom and not pulling the top stuff down. Other times I had to remove the lid various times and mix it as it would create a bubble around the blade just like my cheaper kitchenaid blender. It worked as well as my kitchenaid but for about three times the price. I returned it and got a second one and it was just like the first so I returned it again.
2,Like running a leaf blower at full power inside your house,"My smoothie counter is nearing 150 smoothies now and the product has become as loud as a leaf blower at full power. My kids run to the farthest room possible whenever I am about to operate this and I have had to resort to wearing earplugs whenever I make a smoothie. This can't be right! It does make great smoothies if you don't mind a few chunks of frozen berries or mango that he blender missed. I make a green smoothie everyday with this blender and it has served me well for over a year now, but the noise that comes out of this machine is almost unbearable now. I am really looking at getting the new vitamix, which claims to be 40% quieter than their other vitamix models."
5,Excellent blender!,"This blender is amazing. I chose it over its competitor because it fits under kitchen cabinets and it is ridiculously easy to clean, literally it takes me 15 seconds or less to clean it. You just put 1 cup water with a little dish soap in the blender, pulse it, rinse and you are done! I have been using it daily and look forward to trying the different recipes described in the accompanying book. I am making lots of soups, no need to steam the veggies first, just chopp and dump in blender, hit ""soup"" and a few seconds later you have a smooth silky soup, it's super fast. Wish I had had it earlier."
5,worth every panny!,"I bought our total blender last month and it is the best and most-used appliance in my kitchen. My husband and I now enjoy our fresh vegetable and fruit smoothies every morning. I try to use only organic produce (when available in our area). We both felt the great, healthy benefits immediately (regularity, sustained energy during the day, decreased craving for snacks - etc.) The noise level does not bother me a bit. I usually turn it off before it reaches the next speed level and the result is perfectly fine. It has been worth every penny of its price - one of the best investments I ever made!"
4,"great blender, but you can make it better....","i've owned this blender for about 9 months. i just broke the 1000 cycle mark. no complaints, it has done all i've asked without any drama. some people has mentioned how loud it is. i don't think any 3.0+ hp blender can be quiet. if you need quiet you will need a sound enclosure, no other way.i use it mainly for green smoothies and sometimes a fruit smoothie. i load it up with all sorts of veggies and fruits, many of them frozen. it is not a challenge for this machine.i only have one recomendation beyond the basic package and that is to get it with the 96oz "" wild side"" jar. it takes an already excellent blender and makes it a great blender. i was astounded with the difference.you will not be disappointed with the Blendtec."
2,Blendtec vs. Vitamix,"I recently purchased a Bendtec to replace a Cuisinart for our vacation home. We have a Vitamix in our primary home. I saw this machine (Blendtec) demonstrated at Costco and was told it out-performs the Vitamix. Since we use our machines daily for smoothies, I decided to order one. I am disappointed. I make smoothies out of frozen fruit, yogurt, protein powder, and a little milk. With the Vitamix machine, I use little or no milk and using the pusher as it's running, the smoothies come out thick and very smooth. With Blentec, which has no pusher, you have to use considerable liquid, and then have to stop and start the machine several times to push down and stir to get it to mix properly. The finished product is not as smooth as the Vitamix end product. I'll admit that the Blendtac is easier to clean and I like the fact that it fits nicely om my kitchen counter under the cabinets above. It's a slight improvement over the Cuisinart but not much."
5,Great blender!,"We have this blender about a month and we've been very pleased. We primarily use it for making fruit smoothies and frozen drinks. It is a little bit loud, but the trade off is worth it. Every time, our smoothies come out perfect. The smoothie button has become out best friend."
5,"Strong blender, finally","I'm a cook at home and have gone through all sorts of blenders, including the Kitchen Aid Commercial one. I bought this Blendtec blender after reading reviews with hopes of getting the blender that lasts more than a year or 2 before burning out the motor. I'm one month into it and do indeed find it incredibly strong, sturdy and easy to clean (no unscrewing the bottom and taking it all apart just to clean it). People comment on its loud volume. Well, sure, it's loud, but it's a motor blending. It's not on for hours at a time, but less than a minute. It works, it's strong, it's easy to clean. I highly recommend it."
5,LOVE my blender!,"I have started juicing on a daily basis for health and I am loving this blender. I have made smoothies, salad dressings, dips, pesto... and they have all been great and easy to make. You can either push the pre-programmed buttons for juice, dips, etc. or there is a manual option - I use them both for different things. Easy to clean, highly recommend!"
5,"Great blender for smoothies, applesauce","This blender is great for home use. I can easily make a smooth blended drink from frozen berries, bananas, and other ingredients. Great consistency. Loud, but not any louder than you'd expect -- put some rubber underneath it to cushion the noise. Great for making applesauce!"
3,Performs well but very noisy,"After researching several competing products, I purchased the Blendtec. It performs as advertised. The heavy duty motor powers through everything I have tried. But, it sounds like a jet taking off. Do not use if someone is trying to sleep!"
3,Total blender,"I got the total blender a week ago from Costco's live demo session. I agree with the reviews here that it blends pretty much everything. It's compact and easy to use with pre-programmed buttons. The noise is definitely there but not unbearable. However, what makes me give it a three star review is that I smelled rubber burning at the initial blending sessions. I thought the temperature might be too high for the machine to handle. But I was making smoothie and whole juice so the temperature was somewhat cold. So after examining the rubber rings inside and outside, they all felt lukewarm. I decided to call the customer service. I was then told it could be the rubber in the motor and it might need some time to be broken into... But with such a high sticker price for a blender, I'm surprised that would be an issue."
1,Elegant but impractical,"When I unpacked this I thought it would be a great replacement for my broken travel alarm, but I've just returned from a business trip and it didn't work out well at all. There is no hard cover or case, so the buttons are exposed and get pressed accidentally in your luggage. They beep when pressed, so you get frequent beeps coming from your luggage, which would just be an annoyance, except that once the jostling managed to reset the clock to a different time and the alarm went off in the middle of the day. Also, if there is someone else in the bed with you, the fact that every button press makes a beep (including turning the alarm off) is not friendly to the other person. I love some of the features (like the nap alarm) and really wanted this to work out, but after just one trip I've already bought another clock to replace this."
1,Deadly dull,"A rambling long-winded travelogue. Very short on information on Cook's professional capacity as surgeon on the ship. Almost useless as a source of information but may be enjoyed by those who value verbosity for its own sake. To be fair, I have just read a reprint of this old out-of-copyright book from a different publisher so maybe this edition is enlivened by the new photos?"
3,"Good set, if not a slightly cheap feel","Great price, great little set. The straps and velcro that hold the items in the case are a bit cumbersome. Other than that, this is a nice cheap set, perfect for the occasional barbecuer."
3,chefs basic bbq set,"The good - this was a nice looking set, very handsome and sturdy.The bad - the handles were VERY short.This would be a nice set for folks who BBQ on a small charcoal grill. Not at all useful for medium or larger grills of any type. The handles are so short that you would be burned from the heat. Although this was a nice looking set and came in an attractive box, I ended up returning it because it was useless for our larger gas grill."
3,Item not comply with the image,"I was dissapointed to find that the item I received was not the one shown by the image. Sure, it is model S9 which was the actual one the seller indicated in the goods discription. But instead, picture of S9F0 was posted by the sellor."
4,German + Antarctica = Ova Looven,"This cd is by the band Ova Looven, not Antarctica. But as it does have Antarctica members, its great. like a more upbeat, electronic version. A good, fun buy"
5,just simply magnificent,every ingle song of avery album of this band is simply out of this world.....this album deserve not 5 stars i would give 10 stars.....allpram albums are magnificent....giving them less than 5 stars are a simply insult for pram......
1,piece of junk!!!!!,"[...] THIS SWORD IS NOTHING BUT A CHEAP, CHEAP IMITATION!! THE SWORD WEIGHS 2 1/2 POUNDS, NOT EIGHT AS ADVERTIZED! THE BLADE IS PAPER THIN AND ""WOBBLES"" LIKE RUBBER!! IT IS SO THIN THAT THE BLADE CANNOT EVEN HOLD ITS SHAPE..THE BLADE HAS RIPPLES AND WAVES IN IT!THIS SWORD IS TRULY A JOKE [...] THERE IS NOT A RATING OF LESS THAN 1 STAR BECAUSE THIS PRODUCT DESERVES A ""00"" RATING..........HONESTLY!"
3,great size...still slides around,"the large size is great for cutting and slicing, but the board is not suitable for heavy chopping. there is a small space between the bottom of the board and the counter and results in a bounce effect - best to use a heavy chopping block and not this board. the rubber feet are a good idea, but the execution is lacking as the board still slides and does not grip as well as it should."
5,Excellent review of OXO Cutting Board,I am very happy with the OXO cutting board I purchased from Amazon. It is easy to keep clean and it is the right size for my countertop. I have had other cutting boards but none of them have been as good as this one. I highly recommend it no matter what size you may choose.
1,This product should come with a mop!,"I love ""most"" OXO products. They usually think out an old existing kitchen tool and make it better w/o being too hi-techy in funtion but mod enough to fit today's styles. Having said that, I was surprise when I used this cutting board. If I had seen it in the store, maybe I would have reconsidered buying it. But here I am at Thanksgiving, with a cutting board I only saw on the internet. I bought it for the size, and this I can tell was fine on the internet. And because it was OXO, I trusted the brand....big mistake! Here's why: I have granite counter tops...the thing was sliding all over the place. And cutting a turkey even with an electric knife, you need stability. It has no bottom grip. Also, the reservoir to catch the juices...too shallow! Juice and meat was dripping off the counter onto the floor. By the time I was finished carving the turkey, my cat had a feast before we even sat down. OXO, you blew it on this one."
1,Useless!,"I so wanted to like this board, but I don't. On the positive side, it is big enough for a turkey and it doesn't slide on the counter. Now, the bad: the surface is so slick that the bird slides all over the board and the grooves are so shallow that even a small amount of juice overflowed. It is therefore useless for me. Wish I could return it."
5,OXO 15 X 21 Cutting Board,Love it. Use it all the time I would recommend this item as the first and only cutting board one ever owns. I like the smaller one also.
3,: (,"The board looked great when it arrived.Here's the bad news.You cannot see in the photo but the board has four very small pegson each corner. These ""grips"" create a thin space between the board and the counter.Although the board does not slip, it causes the board to ""bounceback"" after each chop because it is not flush with the counter.I would not recommend the product for this reason."
1,Not dishwasher safe,"I bought this based on it's ""Best Buy"" rating by Cook's Illustrated and because it's listed as dishwasher safe. It worked fine and, because it was so big that I could not fit it in the dishwasher and also have room for other items, I cleaned it under hot water in the sink after each use. Last night, I used it to slice a hot meat loaf and, because it was coated with meat juices and because I wanted to sanitize it during this flu season, I found just enough room for it on my dishwasher's top shelf. When I pulled it out of the dishwasher after the drying cycle, it had a pronounced warp in it which I, so far, can't remove. It's now almost useless for cutting and prepping food because of the bow in the board. This is the second time that I've purchased a kitchen item based on a Cook's Illustrated recommendation, only to find that it's not as good as I was led to believe."
2,What a waste!,"I purchased the book well over a year ago and placed it in my library for future reference. Now that I finally need it to dig into SSRS further, I'm truly disappointed. Besides the well documented script to load the databases not working, I've found plenty of instances where I found myself truly lost in the ""Step by Step"". I really had to go back time after time to see if I missed something. Low and behold, I didn't miss a thing. This was an extreme waste of valuable time away from projects. What the book is missing is a really good technical review. Long story short, placed this one on the shelf and ordered Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Reporting Services 2005 by Brian Larson. Now I'm beginning to wonder about my SSAS Step by Step now. Then again, I'll just save my self valuable time and pick up another SSAS anyway. Hope this helps!"
1,Typical poor quality MS Step-By-Step,"I agree with the other reviewer that had trouble installing the sample files: there's no excuse that Microsoft Press should have let this book out the door without some basic technical review. In order to successfully install the files, you must manually edit the attach_databases.sql file to map the @physname paths to the .mdf files stored in your My Documents folder rather than c:\rs2005sbs (which is never created by the installer). For the intended audience of this book, that's an unnecessary hastle that the use user should have to go through."
1,This Book Is a Waste of Time and Money,"The installation scripts in this book simply don't work. The later step by step instructions bear no resemblance to actual SQL Server experience. I have been using SQL Server for over 10 years. I bought this book to learn SSRS 2005, not to edit the author's book. I have given up on this book and will look elsewhere to learn SSRS 2005. This unedited, unchecked and untested book wasn't released, it escaped. Beware, it will waste your time and it will waste your money."
4,Just starting to create reports - Found this book VERY helpful,I am new to SQL Reporting Services. I found this book very helpful with its step-by-step approach. I would recommend it for beginners.
4,Read in One Day,I recently saw Marilyn and Billy in concert and fell in love with them all over again..I had never read the book and wanted to know more about them...I felt they were both honest and open detailing their lives together as well as with the Fifth Dimension...it was a very good and quick read..I definitely recommend it.
5,very nice book,Billie Davis Jr and Marilyn Mc Coo are a wonderful couple and it's hearttouching to read their experience ..alsoa very nice cd......A very nice book...to keep always near to read regulary
5,Great cable,It Worked and price was right. The quality of the cable was very good and sturdy.I would have loved to have found a 100ft version but not sure if the signal would carry.
4,Same as Dewalt,"I have used both Royal Purple and Dewalt Full Synth oil and cannottell any difference in performance, and I have actually rebuilt a fewcompressors; not just run them till they puke oil then sell them off.If you do a ring job on your compressor, I would recommend using compressor30 weight non detergent for at least the first two hour ring seat period.I leave the 30Wt in until the first change out.When pricing, you need to pay attention to any shipping charges, as whenI first wrote a review on this product, it was being sold by a second partywho added an $11.00 shipping charge where Dewalt (Via Amazon) did not.With this in mind, there is no difference in cost or performance betweenthe two products. (At this point in time)"
2,This book has little to do with the 'actual' publ. industry,"After reading this book, I found that the information is geared toward Mr. Maas' Business. It seemed to me that the information was rehashed with a highlight that one should be proud to submit there work to his literary agency. Mr. Maas needs to tone down his ego and start helping authors."
5,An Extremely Helpful and Insightful Book,"Donald Maass is not only a wonderful agent, but a terrific author as well. His book is easy to read and invaluable for any serious writer. His knowledge and experience are extraordinary, but most impressive of all is his character and integrity as an agent. Buy this book!"
2,Not What I Expected,"I really love his album, ""Auf Wiederse'en"" with its beautiful ""Wenn Ich Wiederkomm"" and several other lovely pieces. I expected similar songs in this one. I don't care for the Brazilian style or the Latin beat all that much. I suppose that this is a good album for those who do like this style and I recommend it for them. I was misled by the German title, but of course Brazilian music is probably popular in Germany."
2,Impossible to Not Put Down,"Well, sadly I bought the hardcover. It seemed interestng and at first I eagerly read on. She's a wacky novelist who smokes and devours M&Ms;, and then her hero comes alive. And if things got any more interesting from that point on, a funeral would have broken out.Saint Just is BORING and his talk is so, well, everybody else has said it and I'll say it too. CONTRIVED!I hear rumors that a plot developes, where? I quit reading because I couldn't find a pulse in the darn thing. And now I hear there's a sequel? Dear God, nooo!Don't even bother with it, lest of course your morbid curiosity demands it. In that case, check it out from the library or read it at the bookstore, just don't buy it. It's terrible.I got about 150+ pages into it without hopes of a plot, and as one reviewer said the contrivence of the will is so outlandish it hurt to read it."
5,light but enjoyable read,Maggie needs a alibi was a intersting and unsusal way to develop mysteries. I foundmyself looking forward to see what other things happen in other books. I always enjoyed shelock homes books but like this more modern twist on it.
4,Definitely worth reading,"I bought this book for myself and for a friend's birthday; we both received the book on time, in excellent condition.I LOVED this book and all the subsequent Maggie Kelly books; I hope Michaels is writing the next one! The whole concept of two Regency gentlemen learning to survive and acclimate themselves to the 21st century may or may not be original, but Michaels handles these characters very well, with a light, hilarious hand. She combines murder and high comedy very deftly. Also, the idea of two 18th century gentleman becoming fond of Monday Night Football and the Mets is just hilariously fabulous (""Go, Mets!"" as Sterling would exclaim). I love this whole series!"
2,What to do when your hero in your book is suddenly standing in front of you????,"This was kind of a cute read. Heavily layered with mystery. I don't know if I want to read the other books in the series, I looked them up and am kind of intrigued on what will happen in the future with Maggie and Saint Just. There was a love triangle that was just introduced between the detective, Maggie and Saint Just and am kind of curious how it will play out. I was a little dissapointed and hoped for more to happen sooner in the first book to kind of hook me and then make me follow the others that follow. I'm just not sure if it hooked me enough. There were parts that were just kind of boring and conversations I couldn't understand how they became part of the story and why it was important for me to be reading them. I don't know, this book was just ok for me, cute yet a little on the slow side"
3,Energetic and funny,"Imagine your fictional characters appearing real-life and taking over your life. Kasey Michaels starts her riotous who-dun-it with a twist where popular writer Maggie Kelly gets the shock of her life when her book protagonists Regency detective extraordinaire Alexandre Blakely and assistant Sterling Balder manifests in her world. Things start going out of hand when Alex becomes a heroic rescuer at Central Park - and really wrong - when her publishing boss Kirk Toland ends up dead after eating her mushroom steak. Funny and satirical, Ms. Michaels wickedly lampoons the publishing industry and deftly paces the tale with snappy dialogues and quirky characters including her doorman Socks, thugs like Snake and the detective Steve Wendall. Ms. Michaels however chooses to downplay the romance element here which may be disappointing for her fans but nevertheless this audacious book charms with its energy."
2,Disappointing,"I have been a fan of Ms. Michaels for a long time and usually am delighted by the wit, romance and good characterization of her books. This book was simply not up to par with her previous novels. The plot sounds far more interesting than it reads. The characters are more annoying than charming and the pace is too slow for this type of book. I was not amused by the dialogue and the plot as I usually am. As noted by other reviewers, there is precious little romance in this book either. Considering that it is a hardcover and thus I paid more for it than her previous paperback releases, it was a severe disappointment. Usually an author earns their way into the hardcovers by selling lots of paperbacks and showing consistent quality and reader appeal. This novel is a step back for the author and I'd be surprised if she continues to be printed in hardcover."
2,Who cares who did the deed?,This book dragged...it was slow....and it was sluggish....and the best thing about it was the end. The highlight was finishing the book and reading the preview for the next book in the series. The first chapter of Maggie by the Book gripped me more that the entire first book so I'm giving Kasey Michaels one more chance.
5,EASY EATING SEAFOOD SET,"HOW CAN YOU EAT CRAB AND LOBSTER WITHOUT SHELL CRACKERS AND HOT BUTTER. THESE WARMERS MAKE HEATING BUTTER EASY WHEN YOU ARE ON A PICNIC BY THE SEA. EAST TO PACK, EASY TO USE, EASY TO CLEAN."
4,Like it,====Pros: (++++++)+quality build+small enough to econome butter+heats fast+cup holder stay cold+base stay cold+instruments work fine====Cons: (-)-cup slides a little bit on base====Verdict: Like it.
1,Flag set huhhhhh,I was expecting a better quality flags but when I saw and feel them well felt cheap. The flag is made of a inferior material and the tubes that hold it if you put it in your backpack will bent. I onlu used it as emergency in games.
2,disappointed in quality,I returned the item because of the plastic shafts and the foam grips. Not what I was hoping for.
5,Wooooo hooooooo!!!!!,"Do you like big, dumb rock 'n' roll like AC/DC, Kiss, or Motley Crue? Would you like to see that kind of music played with the speed and intensity of a punk band? If you answered yes to both questions (I did!), you will LOVE the Tight Bro's From Way Back When.Like everyone who reviewed them, I too will tell you that they sound like AC/DC, because they play blues rock type riffs and Jared Warren sounds like Bon Scott on crack.Some people might complain that the songs all sound the same, and they sorta do. But the differences DO become apparent after the first listen. But really, whats wrong with having your songs initially sounding the same? I could say that of the Ramones, Motorhead, and AC/DC, and all those bands are rock 'n' roll LEGENDS!!!More people need to make music like the Tight Bro's do, its distilled, condensed rock 'n' roll, and its a very good thing. Its too bad they only made two albums."
2,Don't Believe The Hype,"A very dissapointing album, from a band compared to the Stooges, AC/DC, and the MC5. People please! Lead singer sounds like your typical high school emo kid wanting to be a rock star with lyrics that are tough to listen to much less sing along with. All in all, not a bad album and maybe even an album to put on while playing cards with the guys. Do yourself a favor though, and just borrow this album."
3,"Placido Domingo, Songs of Love","Fidelity is poor. Wonder why it took so long for the disc to arrive. Is this the newest of Domingos new albums? One of the songs, Besame Mucho is not on the record."
5,The Phoenix Egg,"A high-tech, high-intelligence thriller, The Phoenix Egg is a page-turning suspense novel of the highest quality. Characters are well-drawn and believable. Plot moves quickly. I could hardly put it down."
3,"A good read, but needs some formatting","Despite atrocious formatting and some editing problems, I was fascinated with the story line by the end of the first page. I could hardly put the book down and, if I read too close to bedtime, I dreamed about it! (Worried and frantic dreams) As a result, it took me longer to read the book, since I could not allow it to be my nighttime read. I could not keep up with the twists and turns of the plot, and found myself surprised more often than not. I do not often get surprised by plot twists, usually anticipating them way ahead. Therefore, I felt quite satisfied by the end. The author had taken me on a journey and made me think."
2,Needs editing,"Caitlin Maxwell and her soon-to-be ex-husband own a technology company. While they're talking on the phone, Scott is run off of the road and killed in a car accident. Soon after, Caitlin finds herself being hunted by Japanese businessmen, French businessmen and the federal government. She discovers that Scott has left something behind that they all want, so she turns to an old friend for help.The Phoenix Egg was written by Richard Bamberg and published by Invisible College Press. I didn't love this book, but I didn't hate it either. I think it has potential, but it needs a good edit. There are lots of sentences like this one in the book - ""Him aimed for the center of the wall and squeezed off six quick rounds."" At one point, the main character's name was wrong. The plot got lost in descriptions and technicalities a few times. I felt like these things detracted from the book."
3,Abridged,"The cd version is an abridged version of the cassette that Pocket Songs released in the 1990's. The cd version lacks three songs (Turn Back O Man, Finale & Day By Day reprise) that were on the original cassette. If you want a complete version of Godspell backing tracks, try the one produced by Stage Stars."
4,they call me the fireman!,I was never a huge strait fan- but i recently saw people line dancingin a tim mcgraw film called flicker. to the tune the firemanvery good players on this cd w/ johnny gimble on fiddle and randy scruggson pedal steel. A+ for musicians .plus the title track and a few other tunes are keepers too.
3,Unbeliveable???,This disc is fair at best. Some of the songs in the middle come together well. But all and all it's just ok. There's much beter lo-fi indie bands out there to check out before this one.
3,"better than pop, but nothing ground breaking","sounds like alot of older bands (sometimes minutemen, sometimes Yes, Sometimes Talking Heads). somewhat unique style in song writing. somewhat poppy too, though. All in all way better than 90% of the bands on the radio and MTV."
2,A disappointment,"This CD came with great expectations and was heralded as representing a ""new era"" in rock music. I tried very hard to like this CD but after several listenings have decided that I have to let it go. At its worst it sounds like a cross between Rush and Todd Rundgren. It has flashes of musical brilliance but too many down sides. Sometimes the lyrics seem incredibly trite. I tried, man. I guess I'm not new-era ready. Maybe I'll reserve judgement until I see them live."
3,You fooled me......,"Sorry I can't give this the 5 stars so many seem to think this album deserves. I've been searching for discs to fill the void that OK Computer left after it. Many reviews compared this to Radio Heads OK Computer so I ran out and bought it and for the life of me can't find the passionate, theatrical, orchestrative bliss that OK brought. Not even close. I listened to it over & over & over and only could come up with: Fun dittys with occasional greatness and occasional annoying sounds.I thought there were some great tunes in Possibilities, Girl O clock & Memory Machine. But, to be a great disc all tunes need to move you. Invited is a great tune minus the weak lyrics and mundain verse. I would compare this more to Radioheads Pablo Honey where they were starting to come into themselves but had only a few gems to show for it. Buy TDP's Change instead...that's a 4 star disc and shows them maturing into something big."
2,shudder to think,"Need I say more? The Dismemberment Plan owe their soul to these guys... and to read reviews about how The Dismemberment Plan have ""created their own sound"". I gave them two stars just because I liked the CD cover."
5,Amazing,"The Dismemberment Plan have been around for about seven years, but they have really hit their stride with ""Emergency and I""--getting my vote as THE most exciting band out right now, hands down. I saw them live when they opened for Pearl Jam, and then I just totally fell in love with them. They put on an excellent show, and I would HIGHLY recommend going to see them.It took a few listens, but ""Emergency and I"" is a great album that will not instantly catch you.From the opening gurgling bass and high-pitched vocals of ""A Lifetime of Possibilities"", to the spoken-word beauty of ""Back and Forth"", the innovation just never lets up. GET THIS ALBUM AND HEAR FOR YOURSELF!!! I am at a loss for words trying to describe this album, because it is so original. Travis Morrison is also a great lyricist, commenting on the mundanities of modern life that we can all relate to.The Dismemberment Plan are THE most exciting band out there right now, and I am HIGHLY anticipating their next LP."
5,The kind of music you want to share,"Here you have a band that has more ambition and raw talent than 95% of the bands on MTV or on Billboard. They create uniquely disquieting and darkly humorous pop that bears repeated listenings, the first time I played this I played it five more times back to back and let me tell you this is the kind of band you can get behind and root for, they lay it all on the line and push boundaries that perhaps only they are aware of. Incendiary pop for modern sensibilities. Purchase this and support a real band."
3,Good CD,"If you want to get in to this band, this probably isn't the best cd. It's a development on their sound that kind of explodes out of their first cd ""!"". If you like them already, you'll probably dig this cd. In my opinion, it's a little more mellow that what I'm used to from them, but that's no reason not to get it. There are lots of things to appreciate on this cd besides just the easiness of listening to it (if you're looking for easy listening, don't buy the cd)- from a songwriting perspective, they have a lot going on, and they make better use of the dualing guitars than most bands I've heard. Also, most of the lyrics are engaging enough to hold your attention, if not enough to make you think or even smirk."

4,Great representations of extinct animals,"A little dated now, but still this volume is a worthy addition to any collection of extinct or endangered literature. Key highlights are the magnificent watercolours (some full page) of birds and animals eg; Dodo, Passenger Pigeon, Pink headed and Labrador Ducks. Good reference text also on some less frequently documented extinctions eg; several wolf species, Eskimo Curlew and various plants and fish."
2,DID DENISE MAKE THIS UP AS SHE WENT ALONG?,"THIS VIDEO REALLY WASN'T DENISE'S BEST. I USUALLY LOVE DENISE AUSTIN, BUT THIS SEEMED A LITTLE UNREHEARSED. IT'S INCONSISTENT AND THUS, HARD TO FOLLOW. ONE MINUTE THERE ARE SETS OF FOUR AND THEN ONE, THEN THREE. CONVERSLY, SHE DOES WORK YOUR BUTT OFF AND AFTER MUCH PRACTICE, IT CAN BE FOLLOWED..."
5,a small treasure,"I will confess that as much as I like Thich Nhat Hanh's prose, I do not care for his poetry. And yet, this small press artisan-paper booklet printed in the late 60's delights me with the graceful simplicity of its design. Four poems: Message, Condemnation, Our Green Garden, Peace. The themes are as dark as you'd expect for poetry of war written by a Buddhist monk.""They woke me this morning/To tell me my brother had been killed in battle./Yet in the garden, uncurling moist petals,/A new rose blooms on the bush."""
1,Not orchid,"These are fine steno pads, but the pages are a plain grey. Based on the title, ""80 perforated orchid sheets/book"" I was definitely expecting different. It does have an orchid cover. Grey-paper pads can be gotten anywhere."
3,Disappointed,I love purple and looked forward to getting these. The cover said Orchid but the pages are an odd grey color. I will use them but not reorder. It seems the main appeal of this item is the color choices. Too bad the color seems to be a quality control problem. Reading the other reviews this seems to be a frequent complaint.
1,UGH!!,I have never seen such a dull color of pink! The quality of the paper is poor. I'll never buy these again! What a waste!

5,Unique design,I bought this as birthday present for my husband who own the antique watch shop.He aiways want to go to London where famous for antiquesBut we are getting too busy to go abroad can not go to London several yearsHe madly pleased this present makes him feel standing on London city
3,Movie Rights,"Mourning Light, a mystery by D. S. Bradley, begins almost sweetly and ends on such a harrowing note that it's hard to believe it's the same book. The character developement is interesting, especially that of main figure Willie Clemm. Mr. Bradley mostly avoids sentimentality and over-the-top-no-way-could-that-happen drama. The suspense pulls you in. I wish it had been longer, because the question remains...what becomes of Willie?"
1,Drugs are bad,"I oculd not stop laughing at this book.I would love to see a satire movie on it but in reality it would be funny just by itself. Any wonder that Malcom X stated that ""Elijah Muhammad has lost his mind"" when he refered to his triats with young girls.What a hump this idiot was."
5,Had a great time!!,I bought set one and two on a lark last last weekend because I remembered loving the series as a kid. Now I remember why. I found myself watching all twelve episodes in one weekend and going back for sets three and four. Please forget the 1998 movie and give Patrick and Diana a try. You won't regret it.
5,Finally After All these Years,"It took seemingly forever for someone finally to have the sense to bring back the original Avengers on video in the U.S.. Well, the wait is over--and oh, the quality. A & E has done a wonderful job with these digitially enhanced episodes. And at $29.95 for six episodes it is a great deal. Emma Peel and Steed never looked better. Bravo to A & E. END"
4,VHS version good -- DVDs are SUPERB!,"Go here (to the DVD versions) to see my full reviews of these great episodes:Avengers '67 - Set 1, Vols. 1 & 2Avengers '67 - Set 2, Vols. 3 & 4Avengers '67 - Set 3, Vols. 5 & 6The Avengers '67 - Set 4, Vols. 7 & 8Forget the VHS tapes -- buy the DVDs! They are MUCH clearer and sharper."
3,Joel,"This is ok I think it is not very deep. Joel is great on TV and has millions of fans, Never goes very deep and in life we face giant problems, Joel tosses marchmallows at the giants, we get crushed, there are better authors with preaching experience, Supernatural events of ANgels are in most of the stories in the bible. Joel misses the supernatural miracles."
3,listen to what your getting,"hey, im 13 and just got this item for my birthday, this mixing consil is a good product if all you want is to play 2 songs at once. this consil has limited controls, and only 3 fadding levels. and dont be fooled! those circles on the machine do NOT SCRATCH THE MUSIC! they act as a click wheel. also, you cant use a bpm, or match levels.i really dont recemend this product. sorry"
5,"Excellent product for the price I paid, and the shipping is A+","Excellent product for the price I paid, and the shipping is A+, this item is A+++++++ it goes with me to any party Ie go, am the Dj in the scene and everybody like it, I will recommended to buy but I think Numark has a new model."
4,Very helpful!,"If you need help passing organic chemistry II or need to brush up on the basic concepts, this is the book for you!"
5,it IS a textbook replacement,"great book. explains concepts, not just just providing you with mechanisms to memorize. was failing orgo all year (actually failing - Ds and Fs on the tests) until I got this book, which got me an A on the final at small liberal arts college in western mass."
4,Not a textbook replacement.,"I just finished my Organic Chemistry course. This book was a huge help, especially since all of the reactions were geared towards synthesis - the most challenging material of the whole year.What it covered, it covered very well, BUT there was a LOT in my course that wasn't in this book. If you're looking for a great way to learn the basic concepts before you tackle your textbook, this is the book for you. But if your class doesn't have a textbook, or you're looking for a more condensed (and easier to read)version of your textbook, this isn't it. It's a good way to learn the basics, but don't expect it to get you through your class.I'd recommend Organic Chemistry Demystified if you want a textbook replacement. There was only one reaction in my entire year of class that wasn't in that book, but it didn't break things down as well as Organic Chemistry as a Second Language."
3,Where are the reactions?,"If you haven't taken Ochem II yet, I'll tell you right now, it's about 90% reactions from this point on. We've had two tests so far, and both were essentially asking mechanisms of reactions, predicted products, etc.What this books covers, it explains well. However, it only has a few reactions in it. I can't believe how many are skipped over in this book, as it seems like it should be the core of the information covered."
3,its alright,"Ok, I struggled with O Chem as any student would, but with all honesty semester 2 with this thing is...well...sucks! I preferred the orgo 2 for dummies because it generalized things more and made it simpler. Don't expect a miracle if finals are coming up and you haven't learned a thing because Orgo is mostly self taught but doing examples over and over again, but these types of book are nice to have as a reference or if your getting ahead of the class!"
5,Highly Recommended!,"I read this entire book and it was EXTREMELY helpful! Instead of memorizing hundreds of reactions, I was able to truly understand WHY these molecules react with each other the way they do. Instead of studying reactions for the ACS final, I looked through the book again. I scored well above the class average (by about 30%). Don't misunderstand, Organic Chemistry is difficult and takes hard work. But this book really explains the how and why behind it."
4,must buy for o chem students,this book and vol 1 are great to have as a supplement to regular ochem texts. it breaks it down & simplifies...always a plus especially in chem. i recommend.
4,RCA value pack,"Two remotes, one full-featured. Fairly easy to understand. I got them because we have an RCA tv, so setup was easy. No real bells or whistles, but a pretty solid performer so far. I wasn't looking for much more than channel and volume control, but my wife programs DVR and watches quite a few DVDs and she likes it."
2,Universal?,"I bought this remote because I needed to replace a broken TV remote that had the Guide Plus control buttons. The RCU800 remote was preprogrammed to work well with the RCA TV and Guide Plus, I was able to program it for my Admiral VCR......but nothing else! Not my Panasonic dvd player, not my RCA stereo, NOTHING! The codes for these components in the manual did not work and code search was useless. I don't recommend this product to anyone."
1,Crap!,This thing always loses the codes I set for it. It seems that it only holds a code for a day then it loses its programming. I put new batteries in and it still has the same problem. I feel like throwing this thing into the floor! Never again RCA.
5,Amazing Grace,I believe we've been deceived long enough and God is opening the eyes for Grace as he always meant it to be!
5,The truth will set you Free.,"God used this book to set me free from homosexuality, legalism, hopelessness...... read it , believe it and be set free"
5,The Real Deal...Accept No Substitutes,"After years of Howard's Conan ""canon"" that was rewritten, bastardized and embellished by other hack writers, the real, original Howard texts have been restored and they are indeed a revelation. Howard's writing is rich and evocative. You imagine the barbaric past vividly. If your only exposure to Conan is the watered-down movie version, you owe it to yourself to go back to the source of it all, the real Conan, the real deal."
5,The best fantasy-adventure that you will find anywhere!,"""The Bloody Crown of Conan"" contains three novellas each of which is fabulous entertainment. One of the novellas (really a full novel), ""The Hour of the Dragon"" is in my opinion the greatest Conan novel of them all, and one of the greatest fantasy tails ever told.In ""The Hour of the Dragon"" evildoers use black magic to revive a long-dead evil magician, who they hope to use to overthrow King Conan, who is the King of Aquilonia. Conan's struggle to regain his throne is the theme of this story, and a great story it is. Howard's writing is vibrant and unforgettable, and the reader is transported to the Hyborian world of Conan, the Kingdom of Stygia, and other fabulous places that existed only within the mind of Robert E. Howard and, of course, the reader.This is truly wonderful entertainment, and Robert E. Howard deserves to rank among the greats of the ""sword and sorcery"" genre. ""The Hour of the Dragon"" is unforgettable."
3,Barry Bond's Career,"Barry Bonds Record Breaker is a great book to tell you a lot about Barry's career in baseball. The book also tells you about Barry's homeruns, like when he beat Mark McGwire's record with 73 homeruns. Also, he got 4 Most Valuable Player Awards, (WOW!), 8 Golden Glove Awards, and is the only player to have over 400 homeruns and stolen bases. I enjoyed learning about Barry's career in baseball."
1,NEVER RECEIVED,I will not buy from this buyer agian. I never received my item or even a reason from the seller as to why they never sent it. been over a month since i ordered it.
4,"This books offers hows, whys and what not to dos of massage!","This book is an excellent starting place for beginner massage therapists & bodyworkers as well as reference for those in existing practices. Offers insight into the beginnings of massage; the benefits, precautions & contraindications of massage; anatomy & physiology; a variety of other modalities; and complete ""how to"" chapters with illustrations. This book was my bible when I was a student in massage school. Hope it helps you, too!"
3,Quick Read,Good escape for someone who is loooking for a short story to read on a quiet afternoon. Good character development for a shorty.
2,Didn't realize this was a cliff's note version,Thought I was ordering the full version of the book. Turns out this is some sort of cliff note version. Will be returning.
5,IT IS JUST THE BEST!!!!!!!!!!!!,"this story was read to me, and even though I said I don't like it when people say they knew about a book but didn't read it until it was a necessity yet found it good is lame. I have an excuse though, I never even heard of it before but this story was the best. My teacher read it in my class and it is one of her favorite short stories. I don't know what else to say other than that you HAVE to read it."
2,Way Overpriced!,"Decent short story, but the shoddy production value of the book is more like a pamphlet than an actualbook; not-to-mention, the brevity of the story itself leads one to read this crappy re-print more like cliffnotes bound by generic cover art than part of an anthology worthy of it's exorbitant price."
1,Reprints Reproof,"Horrifying, shocking and totally suspenseful! Not the story as much as the production values of this reprint. Kessinger.net says that they use the most advanced technology to reprint their titles....I say go back to ink-smudged scribes working in cloisters.Missing letters, misspellings, arbitrary paragraph breaks, missing paragraph breaks (where dialogue from characters are all run together in one block) are just a few of the production horrors lurking between these pages.I got the title to read to my son. The production problems made it a stilted, halting reading at best. I finally canceled the reading and went to mark up the text. I came back in 30 minutes and started again.Avoid this publisher if you value reading comprehension."
1,Terrible Print!,Great book - terrible edition. I have never seen so many typos in a book before. DO NOT BUY THIS EDITION.
5,Great teaching aid,This book combines many different types of learning exercises to help students learn Spanish without settling into a boring routine.
4,Fast delivery!,It's a textbook. Great readings but the advanced grammar instruction is a little confusing at times--could be my teacher though. Doesn't have enough problems to be a workbook.
3,Weird vocab,"This book does spell out the rules of speaking Spanish quite well, but the vocabulary in the stories is really regional - so much so that sometimes the words aren't even in my Spanish-English dictionary. I suppose this is to be expected but it makes reading the stories a little difficult, and I didn't have this problem in a previous Spanish textbook. This book also occasionally has vosotros things even in assignments, etc, and I'm not really familiar with that form at all - it's not hard to guess though."
3,Good grammar book,"It didn't get here as fast as other things that I have bought on Amazon, but it has been a good book for my class at the university."
4,We need many more like him.,"I worked and sailed with Captain Watson for more than three years. You may not like the what he does or how he writes, but that doesn't matter one bit to him! His only concern is for those animals and ecosystems that he is fighting so hard to protect. He is an gifted leader and speaker, one of the world's most successful activists (if you count results rather than media attention), and has been an inspiration to and mentor of many others that fight for environmental justice.Read this book, try to soak up some of his message and his passion - then do something with it."
5,amazing!,"This book will make you laugh and cry all at once. Paul is a great writer and has packed more adventure into his life that all the Star Trek episodes put together. Time after time as you read you are sure he is done for this time, will be dead or in jail, but time after time he miraculously prevails in his Pirate Vikinq quest to save the whales."
1,Watson is a criminal,"Watson wasn't enforcing international law, there was no international LAW against the ""crimes"" he claims whalers committed. He has stated elsewhere that he has authority to ""enforce"" this law from a [non binding] UN resolution that was issued many months AFTER he started sinking ships.This is a self aggrandizing piece of droll from a common criminal. He gives a bad name to a good cause.I'm very glad I had someone else's copy and I didn't spend my money on it."
3,Small black & white architectural monograph from Gustavo Gili,"ISBN: 8425214041 ONLY has 395 exclusively black & white illustrations, and is a concise paperback survey published by Gustavo Gili (GG) of Barcelona in English and Spanish (side by side). A short introductory part on several pages is followed by the main review part presenting each shortly described project in excellent B&W photos, plans, sections, elevations, hard line presentation drawings, sketches, etc. At the end, there are several pages with additional information incl. biography. Most of hundreds of only B&W illustrations are technical, but all (incl. B&W photos) are of a good quality, well balanced, crisp and legible. Like all from the Works and Projects series, it is solid among architectural monographs, but slightly smaller than the Studio Paperback series published by Birkhäuser Verlag under ISBN: 37643* (Basel)/08176* (Boston) or Artemis Verlag under ISBN: 37608* (Zürich)/18740* (London)."
4,Huge pictures of Snow White and the gang.,"This is a very simple short (10 pages with about a 160 word count), story of Snow White planning, preparing and serving dinner for the Seven Dwarves. The pictures are huge and colorful giving great joy to Princess loving toddlers and preschoolers. It's a large-format hard cover with a uniquely cut out shape. While the story isn't much, it has become a favorite for my young daughters because it's fun to look at...and, of course, it's Snow White being Snow White -- all kindness, domesticity and smiles."
4,I KNOW WHAT I HAVE TO DO AND DO IT,This is a great indie album. Only problem is that you will they added a couple more songs cuz the enjoyment is cut short unfortunately. But the best songs on here are Everyone Is My Friend and For Nate's Brother...
3,"good music, bad vocals","This cd is very impressive musically. The guitar lines are melodic and creative. The interplay between the guitar, bass and drums is intricate and catchy at the same time.The singing is terrible and it is mixed ridiculously loud. Screechy, whiny and off key the singing generally feels to be working against the music. But hey, horrible singing seems to be the trend these days."
4,between,"I love cap'n jazz.I didn't love joan of arc so much, but i loved the way they played with language in their lyrics that was so reminiscent of the innovative cap'n jazz lyrics.Owls is not either of those bands. I wanted to love Owls. I really really did. but it turns out I only like Owls. They aren't intense like cap'n jazz, but they aren't as experimentally cool as joan of arc. Owls are somwhere in between.Don't get me wrong here. I really like some of the songs on this cd, but it wasn't what I was expecting. and it wasn't what I wanted. I'm just an old cap'n jazz fan looking for more.Do listen to ""Life In The Hair Salon-Themed Bar On The Island,"" ""Everyone Is My Friend,"" and ""I Want The Quiet Moments Of A Party Girl"" to see if you'll like Owls. These songs are pretty good."
5,Great fun way to learn ASL.,"We just love the Signing Time series and have almost all of the collection. It is a wonderful fun way to learn signs. The series nicely organizes topics, and when teaching signs helpfully describes why a sign is signed the way it is - this helps you to remember how to sign the word in the future. It also uses repetition and songs to reinforce the signs taught. I love to watch these DVD's with our daughter and learn with her - neither of us get tired of them and will watch them over and over, there is always something new to pick up becuase so many signs are demonstrated in addition to the ones that are focused on. They have been invaluable to us as our daughter has cerebral palsy and is non-verbal. She now signs over 300 signs and is speaking in complete sentences. We would highly recommend this to anyone wanting to learn ASL."
1,Where's the Beef?,"There is too much ""filler"", leaving me saying, ""where's the beef?"" A total waste of Rachel's talent...she looks and acts way too ""happy""...gone the way of the dinosaur (Barney). I think you are way to generous with a 3 star rating. I checked out a couple videos from series 2 and my kids just got up and walked away, when before, they were riveted by series 1.Very disappointing...check them out at the library first if you are remotely interested."
5,Best manga I own!,"Rurouni Kenshin is fun, epic and informative about Japan during the Meiji era. I may be new to collecting manga, but Rurouni Kenshin has won my heart and I will definitely be buying more! Plus, for $.50 a book, who could complain?"
2,Was great until it broke,I ordered two of these. After extended use they both broke. I switched to Sunny Folding Climbing Stepper and have been very pleased with it.
4,broken piece,"i recieved this item today. i did not see the shipping slip that be taped to the box, but that's ok i guess. the stepper was not wrap good so i guess that's why a piece of the plastic that covers the area where the rubber cord goes was broken. i tried out the stepper and it works. the display shows clearly, so i will not return it. i really don't feel like putting myself through the drama of a return to these people. just when it's time to buy a new one i'll go to a store and get it so i don't have to worry about shipping it back if there is a broken piece. oh and those rubber bands they send with it are trash. i'm tall and they are still too long, but maybe that is how it should be, i don't know."
5,WOW!!!!!!,"Gail Swanson is one of the best new artists I have heard in years. Her vocals are strong and in a class with Jewel, Melissa Etheridge and Bonnie Rait. Listening to her play flute I could swear I was listening to Ian Anderson of Jethro Tull. Her acoustic guitar is awesome as well. If you don't check out this cd or her other release(Warm heart in a cold world) you are only cheating yourself! If you are every on the Hawaiian Island of Maui check her out at one of her performances at Cheeseburgers in Paradise in Lahaina or if you live in California you can catch her on her summer tour..."
1,"Easy to use & small, but the clock ruins your day","I'm just on my 2nd one. I also like the features--easy to set the time, 2 alarms, good radio presets, and the ability to turn the lighting all the way down.Clock #1 gained 45 minutes overnight. I promptly returned it. Last night I tried Clock #2 -- same basic 45 minute overrun. Waking up 45 minutes early is not my idea of how to start my day on an even keel.RCA--What is going on?"
2,good radio bad clock,"Digital tuning, good sound, and multi station recall are fine features on an inexpensive radio. However, after having the unit for several weeks, the clock started gaining several hours per day! Who needs to age this quickly!"
1,"Would be great, but clock is inaccurate",The other reviews are true. This clock gains time for no apparant reason!
2,3 strikes and you're out,"I tried 3 of these clocks because I liked the size and profile of the clock as well as the alarm time display. The first one gained 17 minutes by day 3, the second clock I tried gained 17 minutes by the 3rd hour! I'm currently on clock number 3 and about 5 minutes into it, it has gained 1 second... we'll see what happens over the next couple days. Although after reading the 2 similar reviews I'm ready to look elsewhere. I'm wondering if it is just a bad lot of clocks as we all experienced our issues in Jan 04. Perhaps someone from RCA can shed some light on this."
4,if only.....,"i love this product, the only thing that i dont like about this product is that the little sprayers that come with the product dont reach to the back of my flower beds. the sprayer sprays about 3 feet wide but does not reach to the back of the bed. i also had to cut off the the ends in order to make them connect, they should have but some kind done something with the end but after i cut it off it connected fine.. so those are the only 2 bad things i could say about it.. so if i were you and a serious gardener and want to water my plants without wasting water then this is the product to buy.. i could go on and on but i will start to ramble."
1,Hydroedge does not work,"This product did not work, the little sprayers blew out, could not turn in the direction, finding the tool to assist with insertion was an issue, the idea is great but for the money and time, it needs to go back to the drawing board for improvements!"
2,Expect interrupted performances,If you like great performances periodically interrupted by voice overs and cut short then this DVD's for you!!
4,Good GENERAL Microbiology Text,"I've been teaching general microbiology with this textbook for three years. I have yet to find a general microbiology text that has EVERYTHING that I want, but this one is close. The authors provide a broad overview of microbiology and microbial diversity. Of course, in doing so, nothing is covered in explicit detail (although resources outside the text are frequently listed). Students will appreciate the price of this book, which is about half the price of most other microbiology texts. In addition, the publisher is the American Society for Microbiology, rather than a for-profit publishing house. One drawback is that the book is only available in paperback form, potentially limiting its lifetime as a reference (although students who sell their books after the class won't care)."
2,Microbe,Other books are more helpful. This book often bolded unnecessary words and included information that wasn't needed. It doesn't really explain some concepts and is very unorganized in it's presentation of the material. I would look elsewhere like a pearson or mcgraw hill book on microbes. I only purchased this book because it was required reading for a class and it really failed to explain a lot of things that it should have.
2,"Good For Undergrads, Better For the Author's Bank Accounts",This book is really simple and it does a good job at explaining some of the basics. I used it as a foundation book in a grad-level class (as a reference for some basic concepts) and it seemed to work well. Just don't expect it to go into great detail about any one topic. Each chapter on metabolism or genetics could easily be a full semester on its own.This thing is expensive and it isn't worth the money. The website is just links to external sites with papers and crude cartoons to explain concepts. These authors are making money hand over fist on rehashing basic concepts-welcome to college!An average book that loses one star for costing way more than it needs to.
5,Adorable!,"This teepee is just adorable, easy to put together and made of good quality fabric (which did not smell!).I would recommend it."
3,Great Tee Pee but think about the actual size,"I love the construction and look of this tee pee but I think the size is quite off. This size is great for indoors but quite small for outdoor use. It says 6"" high the actual size when constructed is more like 5"" from the poles, much smaller inside. It says 5' wide it is more like 4' of useable space. I think the measurements are taken of the poles alone and from the absolute widest point of the tent. Other than that great but if you want something for more than one child to be in comfortably go for the next size up. This is more like an indoor play tent."
1,It'd be nice if the CD Player worked!,"I had originally purchased an RCA RP3755 and the CD player stopped recognizing audio discs. Fortunately it was still under warranty and I sent it to RCA for them to either fix or send a new one. Much to my surprise they sent me the upgrade 3757! Much to my displeasure the CD player experienced the same problem within a few weeks. Didn't recognize any audio CD I put in.So now I have an orverpriced alarm clock. I guess if I want to watch a CD spin (until it errors), I have that option.Don't buy it. It's a waste."
2,A disapointment from the formidable RCA company.,"I had high hopes that this clock raido would be in the tradition of the RCA name. I was wrong. One of the few remote controlled clock radio/CD players on the market under $300.00. This clock has a mind of its own! I think RCA put too much brain in this one because after a few minutes of operation of the CD function, the whole thing will ""lock-down"". Nothing one does can stop the music or anything else for that matter. One must unplug it in order to shut-off the alarm in the morning. The flimsy, tiny, tiny buttons are just that. One gets the feeling the whole thing could break at any moment. He suddenly realises it already has! (Argh)"
3,"They're okay, but nothing special.","Two out of the three cats in my household like these, but I don't feel that they're anything special. If your cat only eats hard cat food, these treats are unnecessary."
3,ok,"Seems ok. My cat liked them a lot at first. Now, not as much. They seem like they're getting cheesier smelling after being stored in the pantry."
4,Good!!!,This is very strong southern rock music by the Rossington Collins Band! A great addition to my collection. Highly recommended!
4,Highly recommend!,"I was one of those people who would quit smoking for a few months and then start back. A friend recommended ""Quit & Stay Quit"" so I purchased it. The day it arrived, I put it in the top of my closet where it sat for over a year. Once I decided I wanted to quit smoking, I retreived the book and began reading. I was so glad I had purchased the book. It was filled with so many great suggestions I used to stop smoking! I have been a succesful quitter for almost a year, and I know I'll never go back. I have recommend this book to several friends and they too have been successful in their quit! Thanks Dr. Rustin for helping me see the best way to ""Kick Nic's Ash""!"
2,You Get What You Pay For,"Plastic wall mount was a mistake for me, I never used it.. I realized that I have a beautiful bathroom, but with no space for a soap dish, so I order this product, but it looked way too cheap to use."
5,The most beautiful singing of the most beautiful song,"Elly Ameling's breathtaking performance of The Shepherd on the Rock just goes right through me. This may be my 'island' recording. You know, if you are banished to an island with just one recording forever, which one would it be? Maybe this one.Ameling has the purest soprano voice I have ever heard."
5,What a Cover!,"It's one of Olivia's best covers! But that of course is not the reason this album ranks as one of her best, and most under-rated. She does a wonderful cover of ""Jolene,"" which is more exciting that Dolly's. ""Pony Ride"" is a beautiful and quite unusual ballad that works well with Olivia's classic breathy voice. Her inclusion of ""Greensleeves"" is bold, and she does a great job with it. ""Don't Throw It All Away,"" later covered by Dave and Sugar, is a winner. My three favorites are: ""Who Are You Now,"" ""Smile for Me,"" and ""Small Talk and Pride."" Her cover of ""The Long and Winding Road"" is commendable, too. Olivia worked well with John Farrar and this shows in this wonderful collection. Definitely a must for Olivia fans and those who haven't discovered her yet!"
3,come over but don't stay too long!,This album was always one of olivia's best covers but the music didn't live up to the cover! It sounds a lot better on c.d because the songs are so soft that they're easier to hear digitally remastered. It's taken repeated listens to appreciate this work. COME ON OVER is easily the best choice for a hit(and it was the only hit from the album). JOLENE and DON'T THROW IT ALL AWAY are my next choices for favorite song but everything else is too low key and similiar. Country music fans would probably love this album but it's my least favorite of Olivia's career.
2,From the undecided peirod,"This is one of Olivia's worst albums, it feels like a filler of well known cover versions - almost like she had to produce an album. Theperformances are good, but often do not compare well with the originals which probably means a bad choice of material. ""Jolene"" is a good recording but hell of a song to compete on, as are ""Come on Over"" and ""Don't throw it all away"", but things like ""Greensleeves"" should be left for Medievil banquets ! I bought the album in 1975, but it has been played less than ""Back with a Heart"""
5,JIMMY SWAGGART,I HAVE BEEN LISTENING TO JIMMY SWAGGART FOR AT LEAST 35 YEARS. HIS MUSIC AND SINGING IS ALWAYS A BLESSING. HE IS ALSO AN EXCELLENT MINISTER. HE USE TO HOLD 5 AND 6 WEEKS REVIVALS AT THE ASSEMBLY OF GOD TABERNACLE IN ATLANTA. THE TABERNACLE LOVES BRO SWAGGART AND HIS FAMILY
4,Used in ;the car on I75,The Comedies were very good and entertaining and it was good to hear the old commericals on some of them. The Crime Shows and Space Shows were a bit hard to follow.
2,Classic Radio Shows,These are not the best of the best radio dramas. I ordered them to use in a communications class on radio production but found most of the recordings the least desirable and not up to the production standards of the best classics. Too little good radio for too much money.
4,Grandfather loved his Christmas gift!,"I knocked of 1 star NOT for the product, but for the way the item was packed for shipping. It was inside a bubble envelope that only covered half of it and then put in box. The cardboard cd case was smashed on one side, but it was too close to christmas to hassle with a return.The product, however, was wonderful! My grandpa immediately put it in and we listened to old radio shows together on Christmas Eve. The shows were very funny and heartwarming, I will definitely recommend this product and other Old Time Radio Shows products"
3,firebrand for radio,"some of the recordings are of good quality radio theater but many in this collection are of little notable shows,poorly written and radio actors that were marginal.I have purchased other radio air checks and recording of enjoyable vintage radio this does not compare.Buyer be careful."
2,not that nice,"Looks nice, but the watch started falling behind soon after. The bracelet also leaves a stain on the wrist. Date started switching unreliably. Not a great Tissot after all."
5,Tight Jam,"Mint COndition gives up a Great Slow-Jam.this Song Sounds Really Cool.I Like How at the End they Include a Bit of a classic O'Jays song when they say you got what i want i got what you want.very cleaver.It's Sad where have all the R&B Bands Gone??Mint Condition is Cool I Hope they stick Together? they are very talented Brothers.one of the very,very,very few good things about Modern R&B."
5,"Beautiful, sensitive","This is obviously the work of someone who has experience with families of special needs children---it is warm, rich in language and provides insight in a very subjective way.This book is not filled with the kind of sugar-coated, warm and fuzzy T. Berry Brazelton-esque didacticism that has Barney-fied the way we think children think. You experience frustration, confusion, and patient sensitivity from the child's perspective---Ms. Edwards is not afraid to show true emotions experienced by children.It goes without saying that families with special needs children would enjoy this book, but it occurs to me that with the integration of special needs children into ordinary classroom settings that teachers would find this book a valuable part of the class reading collection.We bought a few copies of this book...we lent one to a friend whose children have a sibling with special needs and we donated one to our local library."
3,Children's literature,"Although not my favorite book to introduce a classroom to autism, this book does have its merits. It could definitely work as a read aloud followed with class discussions. The brother does give a realistic picture of how siblings must feel frustrated at times. In the end, the brother realizes what his brother with autism has to offer. Not the best book on the subject, but certainly not the worst either."
4,You sink right in,"I've read all of Lynne Sharon Schwartz's work, and although this might be her lightest book, its characterizations and the way Schwartz plays them off one another is dead-on. The social and familial milieu she describes might be comical, as the subtitle suggests, but it is also an urban reality. She manages to be merciless on her characters but treat them with respect and compassion all the same. I slightly missed the intellectual concerns and some of the language of earlier books, but there is a joyfulness in this one that makes it well worth the read."
4,"Bea, the ultimate Earth Mother","I loved the character of Bea in this book. She is the center and no one ever considers that she might find it difficult or tiring to be the calm in the center of the ever widening storm. She is somehow able to pick herself up after whatever new twist is thrown at her and to be an anchor for the whole family tree.This book is fun and smart and full of love of family, in all its forms. Family is all and the children will be protected. Any book by Lynne Sharon Schwartz is a gift. This one comes with a bow of humor."
3,Savvy Soap Opera,"So many characters...so little time. It seems that Schwartz relied a bit too heavily on creating a ""full house"" rather than fleshing out some of her characters. While I thought her attempts to create the ultimate in alternative nuclear family dynamics was often over the top, I was entertained throughout. Okay, I was even charmed at times. A reviewer below called this book ""beach reading for smart people""...that's right on...especially if you're sharing a beach house with your extended family."
3,"Just OK< an easy read, but not particularly compelling.","I didn't like Roy, he got away with too much. I didn't get Anna. I liked May and Serena but the book didn't focus on them very much. Overall, the book was about being able to get away with bad behavior, and that didn't sit right with me."
5,De Facto . . . .,"Despite what other reviewers have said, I think this is a great album in the genre of jazz/latin/electronic. I instantly loved it the first time I played through which is unusual. For most jazz type music I have to listen through a few times to appreciate it. this was carefully constructed and has many levels of sounds. listen for yourself and dont pay attention to the negative reviews."
2,Indistinctive genre dabblings,"Underwhelming, repetitious, poorly produced ""experimental"" dub does not end up sitting well even next to some of Rodriguez-Lopez's more obscure solo works. Most tracks use a very limited palate, making the redundant instrumentation bleed into each successive track with little distinction. Though the disc cannot be labeled purely poor, it is only when this dubby-stoner session concentrates on fusing some of the underused latin-tinged elements that we begin to hear tracks that even contain any distinct personality."
1,Cedric and Omar Dissapointing,"This new project of atdi lead singer and guitar player, well it sucks. This ""dub"" music was a huge let down to the music they have been previously creating. With that in mind I do not recommend this to anyone."
3,Nice lower cost radio.,"This RCA is a nice, not real expensive radio. Plenty of features. Maybe not as good sounding as some of the more expensive models, but not a bad deal for the price."
3,Do you want commentary or the author's original?,"I would give this excellent set of critiques, edited by the estimable Harold Bloom, four stars except for its misleading label. Despite the byline, this is NOT Robert Musil's work or even a condensed version. These are very helpful commentaries, but if you want the original, you must go elsewhere."
2,Confused information,"This book says: by Robert Musil's, but it is not. Review carefuly before to be sure it is the one you are looking for"
3,Barely adequate.,"I know one user gave this a poor review for the smell. Really? Who cares what it smells like? Well, it actually does smell, but that's beside the point. The smell goes away after a few days. What makes this simple device a rather lackluster purchase isn't the odor, it's the quality. The rubber is, for the lack of a better word, stiff and gummy feeling. As a result, the hood does not hold it's shape very well, and always looks out of round. It fails to spring into it's normal position, and has to be coaxed by hand to pop out. I have two of these, and one of them shipped with the rubber not properly attached to the metal ring. It doesn't fit properly, and it vignettes in the corner of the screen because of this, making it useless. It would cost more to ship it back than it cost new, so it's basically a brand new throw away item."
1,Smells bad,I knew I was in trouble as soon as I opened the package. The material that this lens hood is contructed of has a very strong chemical smell. I thought if I aired it out for a few days the smell might dissipate. I was wrong. I eventually threw it in the trash. You live and learn.
4,Cute Read,"This is the charming story of a sushi-eating cat, Yoko, who struggles to find acceptance from her classmates after eating her favorite food for lunch. Yoko's teacher arrives at a clever solution for encouraging acceptance of her students' culinary diversity, and Yoko finds a friend. The book is well-illustrated and a cute read for a three-year-old."
3,What a voice...,"I first became acquainted with Roger Whittaker's wonderful voice on a compilation Christmas album that included two of his songs. My wife then bought me this CD after hearing me rave about this fantastic baritone.It's a great album because of Whittaker's singing. However, the song selection leaves a bit to be desired, as it is so varied that it is almost jarring to listen to it. I suppose that such variation is the nature of ""Best of"" albums, but it remains the greatest drawback of this particular release.Nonetheless, ""If I Were a Rich Man,"" ""Moon Shadow,"" ""I Believe"", and ""A Special Kind of Man"" are great tracks. Though this isn't one of my favorite albums, Whittaker is still the cream of the crop, and this one is definitely worth a listen."
3,obras menores de gerhard,"Sin duda, los ballets suponen, a excepción de Don Quijote, obras menores dentro del catálogo del maestro de Valls. Quien conoce la obra de este singular compositor sabe que su exilio a Inglaterra supone un punto de inflexión tanto en su vida personal como, lo que es más importante, en su labor compositiva. Los ballets se encuentran, por fecha y por espíritu, más cerca de las obras que podríamos denominar ""de hondas raices hispanas"". Nos encontramos en un mundo plenamente tonal, lleno de citas de temas populares y con una paleta tímbrica que poco tiene que ver con la que desarrollaría en la última década de su vida. Quien guste de la sorpresa, la tensión, la ambigüedad y la excelencia de sus últimas composiciones, hallará estos ballets demasidado apegados a la tradición y no demasiado estimulantes. No obstante, hay que destacar con encomio la labor de Audivis por recuperar la obra completa de este grandísimo músico."
5,Adds 30+ feet to my drives!,"First, let me point out that this disc is slightly LESS stable than the Crush, despite what the item description states. According to the Discraft website, the Crush has a stability rating of 1.8 and the Flash has a stability of 1.5 with a higher number meaning more stable.That aside, this disc is fantastic! I immediately saw added distance due to the fantastic glide at the end of the throw. This disc has a long, slight fade as compared to a sharp dropoff of other discs I've thrown. Get this one in you bag to see your scores drop!"
5,classic,"love this movie great sequel, i love how she gets revenge on her cheating husband and his new bimbo girlfriend. to bad Matheson had to die though."
3,Almost a Remake of the 1st movie,"The reason I give this movie 3 stars is because basically it feels like a remake of the 1st much better movie. The ending to me is clearly better in the 1st movie than this movie though. They obviously couldn't top it. Basically, both movies have cheating people that want their wife / husband to die so they can go with their cheating person. Than, they are poisoned the SAME in both movies, & buried. And of course, both of them get out of their coffins alive. Than, they get revenge on the people that buried them alive. I can't believe that they are charging that much for this movie considering that the first movie is so much better."
3,This was more funny rather than suspensful,"This is the sequel to the first. I won't give away too much, but Tim Matheson's character comes back and finds the sheriff passed away and the sheriff's niece(his only surviving relative) who's an old friend of Tim's character.She's in a partly loveless marriage.She wants to make it work and her husband doesn't.Tim warns her if the marriage isn't working to get out of it. She doesn't listen.She get's what Tim got in the first movie and comes back for her revenge.There is more involvement in the goings on of the town and the revenge moves almost exactly like in the first Buried Alive and there are a lot of funny moments with the husband and his mistress.I still like the first one better."
1,You really want the other Ssethregore book.,"If you've ordered this book (ISBN # 1931374198) and are waiting for shipping, you might want to look at ISBN # 1931374236, instead. This item is incorrectly listed twice. This ISBN # does not exist."
2,WRONG SPEAKER,"I purchased a ""Boston Acoustic P450 28-ich Aluminum On-Wall Speaker"" but that is not what I received. The picture is a Boston Acoustic Bravo II and that is what you get. What was wrong was the MSRP on Amaozon's website says $600. The price convinced me that it was a P450 not a Bravo II ($200). I was able to return the item and get reimbursed. Amazon apologized and told me that they would correct the website. I want to point out that the website still has the wrong information. Make sure you do not fall for this like I did."
2,NO AM RECEPTION,"Not everyone cares about AM reception. I do. I am a die hard fan of Coast to Coast with George Noory and Art Bell. I lie awake nights listening to their fascinating tales of UFO's, conspiracy theories and guests who predict the end is near. I ordered this alarm clock to listen to them. The display dims to no light at all, excellent. There is a cheesy CD player, but c'mon, this is a clock, not a stereo system. I figured I'd be safe as the station I listen to I can be heard 300 miles from here (Omaha) as it broadcasts at 50KW from a few miles away from my house. I was wrong, not only does it not pick up that station, but it doesn't pick up ANY stations. Everything else is great, but what were they thinking advertising it as an am/fm? Why not just make it an FM radio (which isn't much better) not everybody listens to AM radio. I contacted the company the day I received it."
2,Not for me.,"I have an old Sony ""Dream Machine"" that needs replacing. I thought this RCA would do the trick. Wrong! The AM radio reception is the worst I have ever had in a radio. I live in San Diego so signal should be no issue. My Sony picks up LA stations with no problem. Also the sound is more like a tiny screach coming from a tin can. Another thing is that the little buttons are in the front. Try laying in bed and pushing one. The stupid thing has to be held with one hand while fumbleing with the buttons so it won't fall off my table. Back it goes and the search is on.."
4,NICE LITTLE CLOCK RADIO,I bought this model because of very few buttons on the top. I have cats and they step on the top of my bedside radio all the time. All they can do now is mess with the CD. I like that you can turn OFF the clock display if needed. The only minus on this model is the dial controlled volume. I prefer a digital setting you can step up and down. Its also a nice size and has very good stereo sound.Its nice that those of us that are not 'Apple Heads' with Ipods can still find something to put CDs in. I have a nice choice of sleep CDs that I use. Going to sleep to nice music is very helpful.
1,"Terrible (Non-Existant, Actually) Reception","I purchased this clock for my son to use. He immediately complained that he couldn't get any ""good"" radio stations, but I figured he just wasn't familiar with the controls. So I tried, and it was true - we could only get one radio station (we live in the Boston area, so there's no shortage of stations to choose from). I tried moving the clock from room to room to see if there was just a dead area in my house, but no luck. We even took it over to my parent's house to try there, and no luck.Basically, you'll get a nice clock that will play CDs, but if you really want a radio, keep looking!"
1,Should just be Dual CD Alarm Clock,"I was very excited when I received this item as a gift. It has all the features I want. One of the main features I want though, didn't work and that was the radio. I had the same problem with my unit as others have had. I got 2 FM stations to come in that I like out of about 20 that I like and get in perfectly on other radios in my home. The two stations that did come in on this unit were unreliable. I would wake up late because the station would be all fuzzy that was just coming in the day before. Not good for getting to work on time! The manufacturer said that the power cord acts as the FM antenna. I tried moving it, fully extending it, etc. Nothing worked. My old clock radio I've had for 20+ years is so much more reliable and gets in so many more stations in exactly the same spot. I was extremely disappointed."
5,Ordering toilet paper online is best left for the severely constipated.,"Nonetheless, I will detail my experience with this product. I like that it's called ""The Common Sense Roll."" Previously, I'd tried ""The Impractical Fool Roll"" and found that wiping my nether regions with silk was simply indulgent and expensive. As for this product, I prepared for an extensive evaluation by first eating 12 Taco Bell Bean and Cheese Burritos with a Chocolate Ex-Lax shake. One ""Common Sense"" 20-pack and 6 hours later, I must confess that I would've been hard pressed to tell the difference between this product and any other, or even sandpaper, so grateful was I that my colonic nightmare was over. And rather than thinking to formulate an opinion on this product, I immediately logged on to Amazon to search for butthole ointments.Have a nice day!"
1,FOUND! Just like the old stuff!,"ALDIfS HAS OLD SIZE!!!!!!!!!!! Aldi's grocery stores has a type of toilet paper single-ply, HUGE 4.5 X 3.7 JUST LIKE PRE-2006 SCOTT TOILET PAPER!!!! The name on the front I don't know, but look for the big 1,000 on the front of the package. Each 4-pack costs $2.49, while Scott costs $3.79 per 4 pack at my grocery store.My bum loves it, and I will NEVER GO BACK TO SCOTT!!!!"
1,Quality is poor,I have purchased Scott tissues for 20+ years and the product is clearly inferior to what it used to be. The paper is virtually transparent. Try another brand like I plan to do.
1,This TP is very irritating,"I have used the regular Scott's TP for years, maybe decades. But the product has changed. The current product caused major skin irritation to two female members of this household. It's rough, thin, and leaves lots of lint. I just wish I had figured out what was causing our problems sooner. The rest of the multi-pack is in the garbage."
1,Scott tissue is not worth $h@& anymore....Literally,"My family has always loved Scott toilet paper for many many years and now that the quality is so terrible and thin now, we will no longer support the sales of this product for it no longer supports our needs. Several people that I know have said the same thing etc. We now see that there a lot of other people here and beyond that feel the same way about these FACTS also."
2,TIME TO MOVE ON,"I have been buying this paper for years. I like the fact that it lasts a long time. However, it is only a one ply, which means you have to use twice as much to get the job done. Also, like the previous person said, it takes a major rip session to get the roll started and it is all shreaded. However, now that I am becoming more aware of my environment, I am moving on. I will from now on be buying only recycled items. The higher the post consumer percentage the better. This paper is very rough and I cannot imagine why I haven't gone recycled before!!"
2,"If you buy 1 ply, you get 1 ply","Scott Bath Tissue, White, 20-Count Packages (Pack of 2)Ok, so my first reaction is not going to be my first comment. Generically speaking, if you're a muscular 200 pound man you probably should be using something other than 1 ply TP. I was required to insert basically any product ID, but when it displayed both the ""New"" and ""Used"" price, I just had to scratch my .- ... ... I mean head. Used? 1-Ply?Bottom line, I remember accidentally buying 1 ply TP at a little grocery store in Moss Beach California about 15 years ago. I didn't even know they made 1-ply toilet paper. Fortunately, it was only one roll cause a little out of the way store like that is not cheap. My girlfriend didn't stop laughing for 2 weeks.Enjoy,Martyps) Don't ever sell real estate. That $309K house in 1997 became $1.6 in 2000 cause the Ritz Carlton broke ground in Half Moon Bay. Think I'll go out and buy some 1 ply TP."
4,"Cheaper than others, but rough!","We've been using Scott for decades, mainly because of price, and because it doesn't clog commodes. However, lately the quality seems to have gone down....it feels pretty stiff, and almost ""papery."" Scott, if anyone in the company ever reads these, please address the extreme difficulty of getting some of the rolls going! I will continue to use it, again because of price, but have bought a package of the soft Scott for the guest bathroom."
2,"If it's not broken, don't fix it!","After being a loyal Scott fan for over 30 years we will be looking to change to a new brand. Let's start with the fact that the rolls don't last nearly as long. The 'long-lasting' feature was always a big selling point. The rolls now have to be changed much more frequently.The other problem is that they've completely changed the tissue. The texture is different - fuzzier, for want of a better word - and it shreds apart easily. It also leaves fuzz behind which is messy and unsanitary. We always liked Scott because unlike a lot of the thick tissues, it was nice and clean and lint-free.It's also a hassle to get the roll started without shredding the first six inches of paper. Wasteful and impractical all around.Scott needs to change their slogan because 'common sense on a roll' is no longer appropriate. From a five-star product to a two-star, what a shame. They need to go back to the drawing board on this one."
1,Who knew the future could be this bad?,"Americans, by all accounts, are increasing in weight. On the other hand, we have the apparent reality of shrinking toilet paper. It makes for an ugly picture. Some have thought that the future would not be good in post-industrial American. But who could have imagined this?I did some Google searches for ""toilet paper 1000 4.5x4.5"" hoping that if I could find somebody selling the classic size of roll, that the quality might also be there.One possibility is ""1001 VonDrehle Blue Mist 1ply 1000sh/rl 4.5x4.5 96/cs 52 lbs.""I have not tried this but the size and the weight seem hopeful. If it works out that this is a good product, I am going to buy like a prepper."
2,Completely disappointed.,"Despite saying ""high resolution"" the pictures are very grainy and the contrast is awful. This is supposed to have the same resolution as the 8"" Westinghouse frame, but the picture quality between the two doesn't even compare. After comparing both of them side by side, I'm really disappointed in this frame. I'll be returning it and getting another of the Westinghouse brand frames."
2,It's just not very good.,"The aspect ratio of the screen doesn't match the aspect ratio in the picture you see on the listing, so the device ""does its best"" to make the pictures fit, with discouraging results. It's like having a nicely-colored comic-book collection of your vacations and family; nothing you really want to show off.I think you'd be better off just using the screen-saver on your computer, or putting pictures on your PDA, or using a DVD player... I can't really see why anyone would buy this.Oh well."
1,very disappointing,The Edge digital picture frame is not very sharp at all. The pciture quality is very poor and a t times even flickered. I returned it but the replacement was no better. Stay away..for the price definitely not worth it!
2,isle of semiclashin folks w/ sparks,"or 2.5 stars. show kinda lenghty for the plots, has 3 ""fiery scenes literally, the last bein so brief. there's an ole mako shark scene. show just ok but a lil borin not that xcitin. the best scene, finally in midshow, is when the dr- ""flame throws the plane out."""
5,"hard to find, but worth it!","these guys are great!!! the vocals, guitar, and songwriting is outstanding.perfect rockabilly, car sounds album."
5,What you see isn't always what you get...,"Mirror, Mirror provides some of the most interesting counterpoint acting of the entire Star Trek experience. Beyond the obvious comparisons of good and evil Kirk, Spock, McCoy, et al, there is a ""fascinating"" difference in observing the swagger and bombast with which William Shatner approaches this episode, compared to the subtlety which Leonard Nimoy employs in developing his ""evil"" alter ego. A most satisfying episode on all levels."
4,Interesting,"It's an interesting show. Kirk and his friends go to another dimensionwhere there is another Kirk and another Spock and the others. But in this other dimension the crew of the Enterprise are the ""bad guys"". There issome annoying political propaganda because the ""bad guys"" salute similarto the German National Socialists. But it is quite an interesting show."
5,Second best,A TREK TO REMEMBER. THE ORIGINAL SERIES NEVER HAD A PROBLEM W/ TELLING GREAT STORIES AND THIS IS A REMINDER OF HOW WONDERFUL THE SCRIPTS FOR THIS SHOW WAS.
1,very misleading,as with the other reviewer I expected a 12 pack and received one toy. They have at least rewritten the product description so as not to mislead other potential customers but this happened with other items I ordered as well. Will not buy from this seller again.
2,All Selections are new stereo recording.....,"And performed by the original artist or one or more members of the original group. 'nuff said, although 3 selections are the original recordings. K-tel Entertainment you know but the ad didn't say these were re-records so for the current price(cheap) and the nice artwork, I add an extra 'star' (1 star normally for this type of stuff).Eddie Holman, Hey There Lonely Girl is in good voice but the backup singers are the pits. The Cascades, Rhythm Of The Rain can't be song by the former lead vocalist John Gummoe, oh my goodness!This was early 60's and 70's RnB, Doo Wop and AM Pop material but it's all MOR (middle of road) drudge now and can't hold up to the original songs. I could go on but...please don't force me.Note: The 3 original songs are; Timi Yuro(You've Lost The Loving Feeling), Gloria Gaynor(He's Out of My Life) but must of been recorded very late in her career, and Barbara George(I Know You Don't Love Me No More) she's actual in good voice."
3,"An interesting look at fascinating, and foreign, ideas","This book has two goals: one is defining the field of ``ethnomathematics'', the second is legitimizing the field by giving examples of what it might cover. This is more anthropology than mathematics, but would still appeal to a fan of Martin Gardner.Memorable topics: the Inuit view of space, a sort of ethnotopology; navigation among the Polynesian islanders (how *do* they steer those tiny boats across five hundred miles of open ocean and arrive at an island a half-mile across? --- this chapter is simply amazing!); deciphering the code of the quipu (the knotted strings that formed the accounting records of the Incan Empire)."
1,Huge disappointment!,"Although this book is not yet available here, it is already in book stores.Considering Ms. Davis' claims of intense research, including attending Darlie Routier's trial, I was extremely disappointed to discover that this book is so full of fiction. I contacted Darlie Kee, Darlie Routier's mother, and she sent me a list of more than 80 errors she had found in the first 90 pages of this book! Ms. Davis seems to have created her own ""truth"" as opposed to the actual facts. She claims to have interviewed people who say they were ""never"" interviewed by her.There is no doubt that this book is very damaging to Darlie Routier, and I am absolutely astounded that any reputable publisher would even consider publishing it, muchless actually doing so.It is one thing to believe that Darlie Routier is ""guilty,"" but quite another to use lies and innuendo to attempt to convince the general public of her guilt."
5,Shocking,"Very disturbing to think a mother could do this to her own children, yet almost as disturbing is the father & parents seemingly blind to the truth. The fact they were in so much financial trouble really makes me wonder how much the father had to do with this, unbelievable that he could not see all the discrepancies in her story & is he just a master of control rather than love for her as he protests. They were his boys too."
1,Sickeningly one sided,This book is poorly written and sickeningly one sided. I'm sorry I wasted my money.
3,High price for Author,After releasing the Precious Angels book the author changed her mind about the Routier case. According to news reports she was warned to get away from defending Routier. On Dec 15th her home was raided by the police and Ms Davis young son was killed. What a horrible price this author paid for changing her mind on the Routier case.
3,Good reading.,"I live in the Dallas area I have read all the books on this case and found this one to be the best written. After reading it, I once again believed Darlie (or someone in her home) to be guilty of this heinous crime. I hear that Ms. Davis has changed her view from guilty to innocent, meaning that some very crucial evidence must have been found...I'm sure it will mean another book!"
3,Make up your mind....,"This author wrote this book after sitting in on the trail of Darlie Routier who was convicted of murdering one of her young sons. She is now on Texas death row awaiting execution for the murder. The book was written with the notion/opinion that she was indeed responsible for the death of her two young sons. The story is one of great tragedy, and downright evil. Upon reviewing photographs this author claimed to have not seen during trail she had a change of heart now siding with Darlie, and proclaiming her to be innocent.Overall the book was well written, seemed to be fairly accurate in the facts of the case."
5,Enthralling,This book held my attention all the way through. I didn't want to stop to tend to anything else. My husband got peeved until I handed it to him when I was through. HE couldn't put it down either! We highly recommend the book.
5,Tops other two books on subject,"Ms. Davis has written an excellent account of the Routier story. It's believable and you feel like you sat through the trial. The other two books cannot compare to this first rate writing. If you haven't read it, get it. You won't be sorry."
3,just wait for the 4th book on this case! Shocking!,"If you are interested in this case and enjoyed Precious Angels you will also like the newest release about the Darlie story. I recommend not only buying this book but also Media Tried, Justice Denied. There are many, many crime scene pictures for all you true crime readers. It will leave you sleepless whereever you are."
4,Undisputable Accuracy Welcomed,"It is a welcome breath of fresh air, to finally read an unbiased, unsolicited opinion of this sad blot on American gothic suburbia. As a former resident of the county and state under examination, and someone who attended the trial, it is very refreshing to find someone not swayed by the histrionics that the family of the convicted murderer so diligently deploy. Ms. Davis' review of the trial is unerring, and ultimately this is what matters most...not Darlie's supporters' unverified claims of new evidence and ""shocking untold stories."" I doubt that this review will earm me much more than a ton of unwanted email, but it must be said that this book, as part of the Darlie Routier canon, finally lays the question to rest for any person of reason and rationality. I have no doubt that Darlie Kee can find all manner of falsehoods and dis-information here, but if she didn't, her new career as a talk show victim would be over, then, wouldn't it?"
2,Better than Flesh and Blood but certainly not the truth,"While Barbra Davis hits closer to the truth than Patricia Springer and has a writing style more mind capturing than that of Don Davis, This is a work of fiction with minor references to some shreads of truth. Ms. Davis herself now denouces the content and claims to back Darlie 100%. My advice to true crime writers is get all the facts before you start putting out literary works that claim to be the true story. I think it is a good thing that all of the profits from this book have been given to the Darlie Routier Defense fund. If one really is interested in the truth of this case the trial transcripts are on line. Too bad all of these sub standard authors got a hold of this one before Ann Rule! Now I bet she would have written the more of the truth and less sensationalizm. Read if you enjoy comparing media ""truths"" to actual facts."
3,Thin material. Ehh I suppose it could be useful.,"For my needs, this unit will not suffice without modification. It's the perfect size but the items I carry in the pouch cause it to hang away from the belt. I absolutely hate the 'G.I.' clip on the back. But I knew it wasn't molle when I bought it and was prepared for the possibility that I would have to do some work on it.Looks like I've bought another fixer upper..."
1,I want those 80 minutes of my life back!,"I have seen hundreds of horror films in my time, and I would put this one in the top five worst I've ever seen. It's not even that charming so-bad-it's-good kind of flick. It's just plain bad. I found myself checking my watch throughout the movie and hoping that something--anything--would happen on screen. There are three bloody murders, but the rest of the movie is terribly slow and dull. The lighting is too dark, the editing looks like it was done by high school students, and the acting could have been better performed by robots. If you are forced by gunpoint to watch this movie, check out the special features. They contain an interview with the director and co-writer. Try to make some sense out of what he's talking about--or even if he's capable of speech--and you'll see why this movie is such a disaster."
1,Should be zero stars,"This is the worst movie I've ever seen, and I have seen plenty of low-budget flicks. There is plenty of dead time between scenes, the story line is ridiculous, the acting is the worst I've ever seen, and the pace of the film is so slow that I dare you to try to stay awake through the whole thing. Buy this film only if you are looking for the worst one ever (which is why I bought it)."
2,Unhinged,"Unhinged has a decent storyline going, though it's not entirely put together just right. The ending is cool, but by that time the slow pacing and poor acting make it so that you don't really care.The DVD case talks about the movie containing violence, nudity, sexual repression, and how it was banned in the UK. I guess one muff shot was enough for a ban, because besides that and some cheap gore and chicken bones at the end, there's nothing exciting here.I picked it up for cheap, so I'm not too upset. There's also a comedy commentary track. I started listening to it, and it's hilarious. Ultimately, it helps me to not feel pained over buying this.One star for the movie itself, another star for the hilarious commentary track."
3,VERY SLOW PACED BUT GREAT ENDING !,"Brian Vandiver's ""UNHINGED"" is a very slow paced movie but it also has its up moments & in my opinion the very creepy ending saves it from being a DUD! Its about a few girls who get stranded at a spooky old mansion with a couple of spooky/wacky host's & things VERY SLOWLY start to get weird,creepy & deadly. like i said in my opinion the very creepy ending makes the movie worth it."
4,Unhinged,Really liked this movie. Has a surprise ending. Not as bloody as most slasher flicks but still entertaining and will keep your interest till the end. Glad i purchased it. Hard to find video.
1,Wel what can I say?,I think this is far beyond being a cult classic... I don't think I hould comment on the content.
4,"Overpriced, but saves a lot of money in the long run","I decided to get my own pair of electric clippers and cut my hair myself. However, dealing with the cleanup of the hair clippings was a pain. I was looking for a product that would allow me to attach my vacuum cleaner and suck up the hair as it was cut. Unfortunately, this was the only product I found that was sufficient. It is very overpriced for what it is, but it works. I would recommend attaching it as I did using friction tape (don't use electric tape, over time it will start to get sticky). It has saved me a ton of time and money by not having to go get it cut professionally."
4,Where have these been my whole life?,"These little lights are fantastic. I wasn't sure I'd find uses for all ten--no problems there, though! Best of all, my car finally has a light in the glove box."
3,They're very small,"These little lights arrived promptly and in working order. They are very small, only 2 1/2 inches long, just a little over an inch wide, and a half inch thick. I placed one in my cabinet to test it out. First with the kitchen light on--there was barely a difference. Then with the kitchen lights off and it was slightly better. The room has to be pitch black to make a difference. The magnet can be about an inch away (max) to turn it off. If you need lights for a small, very dark space, this product might work for you. For better light in a bigger area, you'll have keep looking (or turn all 10 mini lights on together at the same time)."
3,to stick or not to stick....,"I purchased quite a few of these little lights to light areas that are quite dark and hard to see in. The lights are great if you can just keep them in place, otherwise they fall and lose their magnets that keep them off. I wish I had known that magnets were used to control the on and off position of these lights. IF you lose it, the light stays on until it dies out and you have to then replace the batteries. Please, next time mention that the glue isn't guaranteed to work all the time and that the lights are controlled by a magnet. I'm happy using them, I really am, I especially like the click on ones, now they're great."
2,Not well thought out,"The small lights turn off in the proximity of a small magnet that comes with it. It may work in a drawer, that is, if it does not get knocked off, the tape is not too strong or long lasting. It can work in a cabinet: you need to put the light under a shelf in the front and the magnet on the door of the cabinet. Does not put off much light. I found those ""stick on tap lights"" with 3 led bulbs to be much more useful and put out quit a bit more light. The two round lights are quit a bit more useful, but still do not put out much light. Not good for under the counter lighting, which is what we wanted it for."
2,they do not turn off!,"I love these however I realized that, even though Quik Brite automatically turns on when you open any drawer or cabinet -IT DOES NOT TURN OFF WHEN YOU CLOSE!At least that it the problem with my set .The magnet literally has to touch the lamb! not useful"
3,"Not bad, BUT......!!!!","This book is intended as a (very) basic reference to the art of kenjutsu, and that is exactly what it is. A extremely basic text with somewhat difficult to follow grainy photos. The author shows some basic attacks and parries, but no katas, and no excerises one can use to improve on their own. It does the job it is intended to okay, but, lord, it could have been so much better with just a fraction more effort."
3,Mediocre to be fair,"I bought this book some time ago in my early days of studying Kenjutsu and found the pictures and descrioption to be less than accurate. The quality of photography is poor and is not a good book, IMO,. for the student wishing to develop his Kenjutsu skills at an early stage. As one becomes more proficient this book can offer some ideas but also highlights some poor presentation. Would not recommend it as a self study guide!"
5,Awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Wow! This a good book! So many stances,techniques and extreme detail in the words and pictures!Obviously Mr. Daniels has much expierience."
3,Great season but I can't believe they did it again!!!!!!,"Fox learned nothing from the release of season 11. After all the critizism received for the awful packaging for season 11, Fox did the same thing again for season 12!!! They're obviously not paying attention or simply don't care for customer feedback!!! What a dissapointment!!!"
3,"Horrible packaging,Episodes still good","This review is directed more toward the packaging of the product rather than the episodes themselves.The packaging on these DVD's have been pretty bad. Reason number one beign that the discs are not clearly marked as to what season they belong too.This is irritating when you own every Simpsons DVD set there is. Second, trying to pull the discs out of the packaging is just play annoying. Scratching happens easily.In regards to the Season itself I still find the Simpons funny. Every episode has some lines that make me chuckle. Maybe not as much as some earlier seasons but for a show that has been running as long as this one has I think it's still pretty good."
2,"Yes, the packaging sucks!","While I'm a big Simpsons fan, I have not been a fan of season's 11 and 12 dvd's. It's very cheaply made and the dvd's are more likely to scratch. It makes no sense to me why Fox continues to do this? Do they not receive enough complaints about this? Well, I am asking you to write to Fox and let them know! I hope that season 13 is back to season's 1-10."
1,boycot,"I think these is a pretty good season however, after messing with season 11's packaging I am not even going to buy this seasons packaging. If The Simpsons fans would all get together and boycot this season maybe fox would like and reissue it in a less damaging packaging."
1,Buyer Beware Terrible Packaging,"First off let me start by saying I that love the Simpsons. I have not yet gotten to see this season, so I can't comment the episodes themselves. However I did buy Season 11 and this season is packaged the same way. You have to slide the disks in and out of the cardboard causing scratches to the disks and occasionally jamming a disk in the casing causing further damage to the disk. I would strongly caution would be buyers to heed this warning and check out the episodes by getting them from the library.If you do buy it- I would advise storing the disks elsewhere, unless you want to end up with scratched disks that you can't watch and have to buy another copy. I'm curious what Fox is thinking? Its probably cheaper for them to package them this way (while still charging normal prices),but at our grief. Hopefully other fans will make voice this sentiment otherwise the future seasons will probably be packaged the same way (fox studios phone # 310-369-1000)."
1,This is ridiculous,They actually went with the same horrendous packaging again? You can't even take the dvds out without scratching them. I guess this will be the last season of The Simpsons that I buy.
4,Some good episodes,"Most of the episodes here aren't really good but overall its entertaining enough. Highlights for me where ""Insane Clown Poppy"", ""Computer Wore Menace Shoes"", ""Homr"", ""Pokey Mom"", ""Worst Episode Ever"", ""Day of Jackanapes"", ""The Great Money Caper"", and ""Trilogy of Error"". There is a scene in ""HOMR"" which I love where the new intelligent Homer goes to the theater and they are playing a romantic comedy with Julia Roberts and Bill Pullman Homer says ""It's obvious she is going to stay with him"" and then then Dr. Hibbert says ""What! I thought she was going to stay with the snobbish guy"" then he gets kicked out for killing the movie for everyone else. After being rejected of several places for being too smart he goes up to Lisa who states, ""Dad, as intelligence goes up, happiness often goes down. In fact, I made a graph! I make a lot of graphs"". That episode couldn't be more funny or truthful."
5,Tall Tales Never Fails!,"This season is PRICELESS fun including the beginning of what has often turned out to be the most clever ideas in years: The Simpsons story-re-telling and it starts with a horny, homo hobo Homer sponge-baths. How could you go wrong? It's influenced me in more ways than I'd like to mention."
5,Wonderful 12th,Never sleep!! that's the title for this one. I have all of them but this one is amazing no doubt.
4,The Simpsons The 12th Season,"I purchased this Simpson DVD for a gift. I would shop at Amazon again, prices are reasonable."
3,Season 12 - Good...but not great.,"As most fans know, the show's been going downhill since season 8, but this season has some good episodes. Trilogy of Error,HOMR,A Tale of Two Springfields, and a few more. The rest are pretty average, with a few bummer episodes that aren't even entertaining to watch. The packaging of this season could be an issue, though. FOX has heard the complaints about season 11's crappy packaging and hopefully they'll fix it. If they don't fix it, be prepared for scratched discs. (All you need to do to fix this packaging issue is put the discs in those little plastic DVD sleeves. They fit in the box and prevent scratching.)Even if you stop the disc from scratching, the accordian-style inside box is clumsy and cheap. If you're a fan and are trying to complete your collection, get it. If you're just looking for a really good season of the Simpsons, try getting season 4-8. (In my opinion, the best seasons)Its your call if you really want this or not..."
4,"Although not as good as previous, still a worthy buy","Obviously the episodes arent as good as they used to be, how could they be? But I will still be buying them all as a Simpsons nerd! If not for the episodes alone but also the audio commentaries. If you like listening to the audio commentaries too come and join my facebook group that discusses them: [...]"
5,Comic Book Guy!!! THE EXCITEMENT!!***,"I am SOOO excited! I am a HUGE Simpsons fan! I REALLY hope the BOX will not be as lame as the Season 11 box. It should be just like the other ones. Forget the headshaped ones.Season 12 will contain the 250th episode which is AWESOME!!!Worst Episode Ever will be on here - COMIC BOOK GUY!!Other great episodes are Simpsons Tall Tales, Lisa the Treehugger, HOMR where there's a crayon in his brain, and other great classic episodes that you can youtube for now....This season will be a must have just like the rest!"
3,The Simpsons Season 12 DVD box set,"Although this DVD is a good release, unfortunately the packaging mantains the same APPALLING standard as Season 11.What has happened at the manufacturers ?The packing USED TO BE superb.Now they treat the fans of the show as idiots, giving us abysmal packaging.Come on, Matt Groening - or whoever is responsible - get your act together and give us the packaging we deserve.Also, we don't want to wait for almost a year for the next one."
3,disappointing season,I love the simpsons but this sure was one disappointing season..glad to have it but on the other side...ehhh....could have done with out it..a few good ones on this..homer and the crayon..marge getting drunk...and lisa finding the bully secret
4,"""Limited Edition"" packaging or standard? Comic Book Guy Head is BOTH!","Just a quick note about the packaging:If you aren't sure whether to go with Comic Book Guy ""limited"" packaging or standard, (and I've notice some retailers, perhaps anticipating the unpopularity of the bulky ""limited"" packaging, are selling it at a considerable discount over the standard packaging) here's a little secret:The ""limited edition"" packaging is little more than a 3-D molded Comic Book Guy face attached with rubber-cement to the front of the standard edition packaging. That's right--the standard packaging artwork is right there underneath Comic Book Guy's fat face! You can EASILY peel the Comic Book Guy face off the front of the box without damaging either, and you now have the standard DVD packaging, which will fit on your DVD shelf, as well as a Comic Book Guy face that you can display or toss in the trash."
5,Special edition packaging this time not nearly as bad.,"I won't go in depth here about the episodes in this season... anyone who's picking up the DVD set knows about these already. I will say the special edition head box is a lot better than last season. While it's not as easy to get them out of the sleeve as if they were in plastic holders, they made the cardboard dividers in between each disc a lot thicker and somehow that lets the DVD's slide out a LOT easier than with season 11. One disc in last season's set was nearly impossible to get out, but it's not so bad this time around."
1,Packaging Sucks!,"Even though the episodes are funny and fine....the packaging of the 11th season and 12th season are so bad...I can't give this anything higher than a one star. Does it make any sense to make a ""collection"" of DVDs scratchable in it's own case??? C'mon people - THINK!!! Go back to the way they were made (Season 1 - 10)."
2,all discs are scratched....bad bad packaging,They really dont care do they ? Giving us a product where the dvd sleevesscratches the discs everytime we take them out of their cheap cardboard whatever.Bummer. Thats it with this review....before i start spitting fire !!
1,Junk,"This is JUNK. I got it as a gift for my Mom and it broke after two weeks. She contacted the manufacturer, and they sent her the part that broke, so she took it apart and fixed it. About two weeks later, it broke again (different part). All told, she's had 5 different things break on it. When it works well, it works, but it's too flimsy. She's given up..."
1,Not what I'd hoped,"First off, this stair stepper is NOT quiet. The pedals clunk and creak, and after 5 minutes of usage the hydraulics begin to wheeze. The feet are not level so it rocks slightly back and forth (it's not because of an uneven floor). It was assembled correctly and all the screws are tight, but there is a lot of give in the main stem and the handles are so loose they move an inch in a front/back motion. I've had this piece of equipment for two weeks and use it 3 or 4 times a week for 15 minutes at a time. Every time I use it, I hear new squeaks, clunks or other noises. It's so loud I'm afraid of waking up my napping toddler in the next room. I really thought I'd get better quality for the money. I'm dissapointed with this purchase. I would have done better to get the $40 mini-stepper from Target."
1,Terrible,1. The encloded codes do *not* cover the functions of amplifiers and dvd players completely.2. Adding new keys (label learning) can cause main keys to disappear...you must start over by resetting the device.3. There is great difficulty adding codes. It will not accept certain remote codes.This is best avoided!!!
1,Laughable,I bought this remote from buy com and returned it promptly. Teaching this remote new commands is next to impossible. I have the One-For-All Kameleon and it is a breeze compared to this piece of crap!
3,"Bueno, pero con fallas graves","Yo compre el modelo RF, y lo compre principalmente para manejar mi equipo de DTV a distancia, en eso anda perfectamente desde toda mi casa. La parte estetica esta muy bien y la pantalla se lee claramente. Pero se desconfigura seguido, y lleva casi 1 hora volverlo a configurar y consume un juego de 4 pilas AAA cada 4 dias. La funcion learning tambien va algunos problemas"
4,cute little leathery mammal guys,"The fact that you're reading this review indicates that you already know that bats are good guys, not bad guys. 'Nuff said.Next thing, you'd probably like to have a bunch (they only come in quantities) in your yard. OK, then start with this Stokes guide.It's bedecked with stunning photos and a cool set of symbols that tell you about migrational (with apologies to Monty Python) patterns, roosting preference, how they fly, and what the little guys like to munch on.The Stokes Guide will also tell you how to make a bat house so they have a decent place to crash, but you might just as well buy one inexpensively at your local quality birding shop.You can't go wrong with this attractively presented Beginner's Guide to Bats."
5,Great Useful Book!,This terrific little book is chock full of useful information. We used the section on making a bat house bat-friendly and hung three bat houses following the directions. There's also a section that tells you what type of bats are common to your area and how to identify them; I flagged the pages for the three common potential house mates and four less common that might ultimately move in. An excellent reference book.
4,Great bat resource,"This is an excellent little book, well written, packed full of facts and lovely photography and all the statistics you would ever need.Would have been 5 stars if the format was traditional 6x9 or similar, and it was less expensive."
5,easy read,easy read - just wish the bats knew they were supposed to live in the bat house i purchased for them!!
3,Nice short story,"This is a fairly simple book that my 3 year old likes, but my 5 year old finds a little too simple. It does have cute illustrations and would be a good rainy day book."
4,Kipper is a hit,"My 2-1/2 year old twins really love Kipper. It began with the TV shows (which they adore and beg for EVERY NIGHT) but they love the Kipper books too. Gentle characters and appealing themes. They like this one because it's been a rainy winter in San Francisco and they can relate to the umbrella and rain. They are fascinated with themes of WET v. DRY so this book helps with those notions. I also think the girls enjoy this book because of the charming non-busy pictures, and the simple themes that they can understand. Kipper is great!"
2,Only average textbook,"This book does not do a good job in explaining the basic concepts of Statistics and how to apply it for quantitative analysis of Investments. The only reason why this book sells is that it is part of the recommended texts for the CFA program and the authors are part of the AIMR board. I am pursing the CFA charter as well as my masters in Economics and I would suggest the book ""Introductory Statistics"" by Thomas H. Wonnacott, Ronald J. Wonnacott which does an awesome job in explaining the basic concepts of Statistics. You would understand WHY we do such and such instead of memorizing formulae."
5,P J Ford Oriental Rugs,"This book is brilliant and much better than I expected. I do think anyone interested in rugs should think seriously about buying this book, even as a coffee table book. The price and service delivery was also all one could want."
3,to much money for the value,baby only makes 2 different sounds and a bottle suckling noise. Its as cute as any other doll but there is nothing special about it that makes it worth the price. I wish I had not spent the $69.00 on it when other dolls made just well and just as fun are much less.
2,Should have been a better doll for the money,"This doll sounded great and so did most of the reviews. But it was a Christmas disappointment for my 4 year old daughter who loves dolls. After a couple of hours of playing with the doll my daughter went back to her Target special $10 doll and put the $80 doll in the doll crib and there she sits. It took my husband squeezing the doll (almost in half) to get her to laugh, there is no way a young child could do it. Simply I expected more because the doll cost so much."
4,Great Christmas Gift!!,"This doll made a great Christmas gift for our grandaughter. Amazon shipped really quick, and we had her four days after order."
4,"Pretty doll, but . . .","I won't spend time repeating all the lovely, glowing reviews about Lila--and she is a pretty, good quality doll. I was surprised, though, that no one mentioned anything about her crying. She makes 4 very lifelike sounds, but the crying lasts about 4 times longer than the others and does not stop right away once you turn her over from her tummy. And whenever my daughter makes the natural move to put her over her shoulder to burp her or comfort her, Lila starts crying. It's a bit unnerving for my husband and I--we've often wished we could just turn off that one sound. The silver lining is that we're preparing for baby #2 and Lila's prolonged crying may just desensitize baby #1."
4,Cute doll...sounds/noises are pleasant...fairly quiet..,"My daughter had been hoping for an interactive doll. Too many of them (in my opinion) are either too loud, (I don't want a doll in my house that can cry at any random time in the middle of the night.) or have unnecessary funtions. (Again, no thank you on the dolls that can go to the bathroom. #1 and #2...yuck!) This doll has enough functions to keep a child's interest without it going overboard. Great for families who would like to keep some things left to the imagination!!"
2,"crying too long and real, cries much too easily","Lila's cry is MUCH too real and MUCH too long (~20 seconds). If the bottle gets placed in her mouth, she quiets down and makes sucking noises. I am hoping we never loose her bottle!!!!!!!! Neither the pacifier nor her thumb quiets her.She is also MUCH too sensitive to crying, even slightly angling her downward (45 degree angle) makes her cry. My daughter (age 5) even gets dismayed at times and has to turn her off.I am disappointed as I bought her because of the awards she has won. My recommend? If you are a very sensitive, caring parent, do not make this purchase."
3,Beyond the Basics:French (CD) (Complete Basic Courses),Our small group has practiced Lesson 1. We're happy with the book and with the CD. Although when the CD is repeated the second time at a slower rate the segments are too long.
1,Post Modernist psyco-bable,"As an arcaheology student studying vernacular architecture, I found this particular text to be a waste of time. It does nothing for the history of architecture, nor does it lend itself to coherent reading."
1,green! a green cover?,"Come on... needs more pictures. Phenomenological.. yeah, like that's a real word."
2,Deceiving Photo,"The picture is deceiving. The face looks blue in the picture, but it is really purple. I found the watch to feel cheaply made. The bracelet felt substandard to what I am used to with Invicta. I currently own two Invicta watches. I sent this watch back for three reasons. I didn't like the color of the face. I found the watch to be smaller than I prefer. The bracelet seemed cheaply made, and the black etching on the links was not evenly applied."
3,Minute Hand,I own 8 Invicta watches. I've found them to be ok for the price- but they do have issues.This one is nice and actually gets complimented a lot. After 2 years of use the minute hand does not work.Since I live outside the US ( Honduras) it's not worth it to send it back. Overall I'd recommend buying it because of the price- but don't get your expectations too high.
3,Closure....Get real,"I've been reading these books for 11-12 years. I own all 72 of them, as well as the special editions that go along with them. I was extremely disappointed in the last book, as we get no closure with anyone's story line except Allie's. Christina and Parker are not resolved. Everyone was expecting them to get married, and that did not happen. Melanie and Kevin were also not resolved. I loved this series growing up, however there are a few irritating things that I would like to point out. Cassidy's story line for book 32 was ridiculous, especially because she's not a main character. Introducing Allie was another extremely bad idea, because we never get closure with Chris & Mel's lines before she is brought up. In the last few books, it seemed as though there was a lot of jumping around. I am glad the series ended because at 72 books, it was time to let it rest. We as readers still needed closure though!!"
1,Waste of time,"Stupid, stupid, stupid. WHY did I read this? You don't find out anything about the characters. There's no sense of closure, whatsoever. Unless you still really love these books and can stand the constant errors, bad writing, OOCness, and cliches, save your time."
2,The Books Have Their Day,"I think that its about time these books were ending. Because they have been going for 14 years, and inneeding a brake. People have been saying how the books have been going down and the books aren't the best in some of them, they could of been better. It is sad to see them shut the books down, but the letter did say that they might write a hoilday special, or something. As they say, ""What goes up, must come down""."
5,Excellent Creative Book for Kids!!!,"Princess Crafts celebrates the ""modern princess,"" as it combines classic princess ideas from literature and film with a modern twist for the soon to be independent woman. The creative and fun craft projects (which mostly require simple and easy to obtain supplies) will entertain little girls endlessly (and some adults too). The text, charmingly written by Hauser, is clever and humourous yet consistently provides clear instructions on the projects. Parett's dynamic illustrations and high quality photographs also provide a solid road map for the crafts. Finally, one of the best aspects of this book is that the projects and activities are sure to inspire these young princesses to be creative and crafty beyond the scope of this fantastic and original book for kids."
5,Crafty and Creative,"This book is chock full of fantastic craft ideas for kids of any age, economic status and creativity. The author is able to take items we already have around the house and make fun and diverse craft projects. I highly recommend this book to anyone that has a princess in THEIR family."
5,Brings out the sparkly princess in young and old,"This book is fantastic fun meant for young girls, but all ages of girls will embrace their inner princess while looking at the enchanting pictures, reading the cute and clever princess jokes and anecdotes, and trying their princess hands at the practical yet adorable crafts and yummy fun recipes. The crafts in this book are simple tp make with common household items, yet when put together following Elizabeth Hauser's ingenious visions, will produce crafts that will delight any young girl desiring to dress up and feel special, like a....princess. The visuals are catchy and the instructions easy to follow. This is by far, the best princess-themed book out on the market today. Get this for any young girl you know, they are guaranteed to love it!"
4,OK,"The design of these mittens has changed since I bought my last pair. These run small and aren't quite as warm as the older style, but they're still nice to have in the winter."
2,Poor quality,There is no way I can use these out West. Stitching was poor. NO insulated enough. Just cheap! Try again
5,From a reader who served on a ship he commanded,I served with this man in 1957. He inspired me in person. I knew a small part of this true story. and learning the rest of the story leaves me moved and grateful for his many services to this nation.
3,"Good, but not ideal for beginners!","It's a very good product (Capezio), high quality but the heel is too high for students that are doing character dancing for the first time; beginners should start with a 3/4"" heel... ...unfortunatelly, I just learned that!"
2,OK-weird bottoms,"Overall, these shoes really didn't live up to my expectations. The bottoms of the shoes are made of a weird material and they slide around really easily. Also, I ordered a size larger than my street shoe and they were to big, so I would only go half a size up."
2,Sizing is misleading,The shoes are pretty and well made. However the sizing appears to be 1.5 size smaller than advertised. Recommend purchasing larger shoes.
2,two sizes too small,"Going with a previous reviewer's advise to go with one size bigger. As it turns out, the product is actually two sizes too small. We went with one size bigger and had to use shoe stretcher to get it to be one size larger."
4,Very pleased for the purpose,"Daughter was required to have character shoes for the play she is in. Especially compared with the local dance store and super department store options, I feel the value is great - leather shoe at a great price. Delivery was faster than expected. Heel construction is weak though and has worn very quickly."
5,"Great price, comfortable, but runs small - buy a half size larger!!","Several people mentioned in their reviews that the shoe runs small. I didn't take their advice, ordered an 8 (usually wear between a 7.5 and 8), and had to return it for an 8.5. Fortunately, they were GREAT about the exchange, no hassle, no additional charge for shipping, and I received the larger shoe within a few days. Using them now for a theater production and the shoes look and feel great on stage."
3,Tap Shoes not taps included,"I bought these for tap shoes for my daughter. Shoes are good quality did not realize in the fine print, TAPS NOT INCLUDED. Could have bought shoes for less else where with taps."
5,I'm so pleased!,I needed these shoes quick so I paid the $3.99 for 1 day shipping and they came the next morning. I did order one size larger and they fit perfectly! The are very comfortable. Less than $30 for a pair of Capezio shoes is a great price too.
3,"Small, but good quality","I'm normally a size 8, but the shoe was small especially around the toes. I returned it and am waiting to receive a size 8.5. However, the shoe was very sturdy, nice, and good quality."
4,character shoes,"I ordered these shoes for a high school student to wear during a production. After reading the reviews, we decided to order them one full size larger that the normal shoe size. This was definitely the way to go. After hours of use there were no blisters or pain. I recommend going the full size larger."
1,don't go there,"I ordered these for my daughter after reading all the reviews. We still ordered the wrong size, even though we ordered one full size up. I wouldn't be in a hurry to order these again. We lost ten dollars in the deal, due to return fees, and we still don't have the shoes we need."
1,No Reliability,"I was told by my director a week before our show opened that he wanted me to wear black character shoes instead of tan. Having Amazon Prime, I ordered this product which verified that the shoes would be delivered in two days. However, four days later I still hadn't recieved the delivery. When I went to track my package, the delivery estimate was still set for two days after I ordered it yet the order hadn't even been shipped yet- four days later! After a week of nothing, I checked again and now the order has disappeared from my account as if I never even ordered them in the first place. Needless to say, there was no reliability from this company who- after making a mistake by not shipping my shoes- decided to just erase the order entirely. I rarely write reviews but feel as if I should warn other customers before something similar happens to them."
3,The shoes didn't come with taps! Taps have to be purchased/put on separately. Is this normal?,"I got the black Women's size 7 tap shoes and they look nice. The heel was just the right height, but no taps included?! They weren't put on the shoes nor were they included in the box. This is weird. Now I notice that the photo in amazon featured just the shoes with no taps. I should've been more observant! Now I have to purchase the taps from a specialty dance store and go to a shoe repair shop to have the taps put on professionally. Beware."
3,Pretty good,"I got the shoes for a musical I'm in. The sizing is definitely weird. My street shoe size is usually a 9 or 9.5, so I ordered 9, 9.5, and 10. I also have pretty wide feet. Turns out the 9.5 fits fine and I had nothing to worry about. The ball of the foot area is REALLLL snug though, and I ordered the wide size. Hopefully they stretch out with wear."
4,I like these shoes better than the last ones I ordered,"I ordered this style for the second time, only in a half size larger...they fit and I can dance in them. The last pair was too small and although I could dance in them, they were very uncomfortable...I still have them, but, can't use them. when they say to order larger than you regular size, pay attention, it will be worth your while,..."
3,Too Small,The shoe is nice but they run really small. I am not sure if this is how dance shoes are supposed to fit but I wear a size 9. So I bought a size 9..they were tight so I exchanged them for a 9.5...they are still tight in the toe area. Be careful!!
3,Character Shoes,"Like most people have said, I'd suggest a half size up from your regular shoe size. I had bought character shoes from this company before, so I was pretty sure how they'd fit, but they changed the material they use for the top of the shoe since my first purchase. Now the black cover on the upper part of the shoe scuffs off VERY easily. I have only used mine for one show and there are already places where the top layer is rubbing off. I'm hoping that some black shoe polish or something like it will help."
3,Run small,"I purchased these shoes a half size larger than I normally wear and found them still very tight. Toe area is quite narrow. Otherwise, well made and good height for dancing."
4,Beware of Sizing,"I bought these as a first pair of dance shoes, and love them, but I had to return the first pair because, even ordering a size up, they were way too small for me to dance in. 1.5 sizes up is snug but not unbearable. I'll have to wait and see how they break in to know for sure, but the style is attractive and I would for sure recommend them."
4,This is the reason why I only gave it 4 stars.....,"I wear a size 9 1/2,so just in case, I ordered a 10W in these shoes. They were shipped VERY quick! I bought these because I was doing an Oklahoma Play, and we had to have these kind of shoes. So when I tried them on.....OMG! The top of the shoe that goes to the toes made it to where I could not even walk! On the top of the shoe that goes to where your foot starts to show kept digging into my foot. Everyday, my feet would be very swollen and sore. I had to were these shoes every day, 6 hours a day, for a week. Then, I had to wear them in our 4 performances. As soon as I would get off stage, I would just stop and rip them off quick! It was just awful! My feet are still sore, and the play was a week ago! I tried to wear them a lot so that the top would stretch, but nada! I know that I will NEVER wear these shoes ever again, so I am just going to resell them."
4,little snug,I would give this a 5 star but they were a bit snug in comparison to the same show in leather. recommendation- order 1/2 size larger. My daughter tried on the leather style in a store prior to purchasing these on line and needed them pronto for a theater performance. Shipping was fast and affordable compared to the shipping cost of a dance store we usually purchase from. Great shoe.
3,Bronze?,"The shoes were not the light metallic color shown in photo. They were a dark brown. Very cute though. Unfortuately, the openings in the upper vamp didnt agree with my toes, they get caught in them. On a positive note, the service was awesome and they were very prompt in responding to my return request."
5,surveying the soft language of the mennonites,"This book is very very straightforward and very helpful to help any one pick up these lovely soft words of the mennonites and ukranian farmers. :) Having ukranian in my distant members of family and my family having a circle of mennonite friends, this is a very good tool for picking up this lovely language. It's very diffacult to find a book about low land german or ""Plattdeutsch"" as it is called. :)"
4,You have heard the Cathedrals until you have heard them live,"For those of you who have not been blessed with attending a Cathedral concert ""Alive,Deep in the Heart of Texas"" is the next best thing. Nothing can quite catch the essence of the Cathedrals quite like a live performance. Be listening for ""Echos from the Burning Bush"" ""Don't be Afraid"" ""There's Something About that Name"" and ""I Will Serve Thee"". They will comfort your heart and thrill your soul."
3,EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE!!,"Within 24 hours of contacting the vendor, they had offered a complete refund! We accepted the refund, but intend to continue shopping with them. We just need to be more careful in reading product descriptions!!Although the packaging was identical, the previously provided product was soft tablets which could be easily cut. What arrived was hard, tablets."
4,why pay more?,"I ordered these vitamins in Feb of 2008 and they were $34.00 before shipping, 6months later they are $48.50 before shipping?? Too bad because they were very helpful for my lab. I will be looking elsewhere for another product and for a company that is not a rip-off!!!"
5,Makes an old dog good as new,"My dog, getting up in age, was getting a bit gimpy. So, after some careful research, I chose Glyco Flex to help her ease into her old ladyhood. It's a really great product that she takes (slathered in a healthy shmear of peanut butter) every other day now that we're on maintenance and it helps her to get around like she's a much younger dog. For the record, she's 13 and pretty active, but I absolutely notice a difference in her ability to climb up to and jump off of my bed. I know that she won't be around forever, but she's absolutely making the best of what she's got. This product is helping her to live and get around more comfortably with (as of yet) no noticeable side effects. I've had trouble with the chemicals in arthritis products upsetting her stomach before, but not at all with the Glyco-Flex. Glyco-Flex won't give your dog it's youth back, but it will help them get around a hell of a lot better."
4,Great Service!,"Have been giving this product to our dog for about a month now and it seems to be helping. She still has some tenderness in her rear leg or hip, but hopefully that will be taken care of with continual use of this product."
4,Challenging...and interesting,"This CD captures the improvising atmospheric spirit of KC. This music has a very modern sound to it. I especially like The Deception of Thrush. Although some parts go too far, this is progressive and worth listening to."
3,"An important legal-drafting text, but a bit dated.","This 1996 edition of The Elements of Drafting is the ninth--the first was published in 1949. At that time it was certainly a leading text. It covers fundamentals of legal drafting, including organization, definitions, words of authority, expressions relating to time, and others. In 1949 it was probably one of the earliest texts to do so in a thoughtful way.But the book contains many remnants of that era. It is written in a somewhat archaic and stilted style--by contemporary standards. The cases cited for support on many points are quite old. And the drafting examples are outdated. Most of the book's principles are still sound, but the presentation seems dated in 2002.(The author is Australian and the book addresses mostly Australian law.)"
2,More superficial than I had anticipated,"Disappointing. I thought a writer of Elting's stature (Napoleon's Marshals, etc.) would have more of substance to say. Instead he gives what amounts to a general overview with a lot of name dropping. I did find his take on Basel Liddell-Hart to be refreshing though (he's a pretentious phony). His last chapter on the cold war and the Soviet Union is, of course, totally off base. All in all, don't bother unless you've read everything else in the field."
5,Hot New Release!,"A wonderful written book about a curious little boy who realizes that doing things for others just might bring a smile on someones face. I recomend purchasing this one and reading it to your kids. Your kids will just absolutly enjoy it. A must read. It got my curiosity up, how about yours?."
4,From The Heart,"This book opened my eyes by revealing the true purpose of clothing and it taught me how a Christian woman (that is, a woman who has a relationship with Jesus Christ) is supposed to select her wardrobe. It may be a short book, but it was most powerful, in my opinion."
2,These are sooo ROUGH compated to Pampers brand wipes,"I was told to use Pampers wipes and diapers from the beginning, but received some of these Huggies wipes at my shower. I decided to use them and they were like sand paper compared to Pampers brand. Yes, they are thicker, but the Pampers remove the poo just as well. I went by what would feel best to my baby, and that was the Pampers, as I knew they felt better to me. I can't say enough good things about Pampers wipes and diapers for that matter. I didn't even use the rest of the pack on my baby, I just couldn't do it. I hope this helps any parent trying to choose the best thing for their baby."
1,Too dry and rough...not recommended.,Much too rough and dry for our baby. If you want to find good baby wipes I recommend the Pampers Sensitive wipes which are soft and moist.
2,"Buying these from Amazon was a rip-off...go to Costco, same thing",You can buy 3x more for a lower price. You can get the same Huggies Natural care Baby Wipes at Costco. I'm not trying to plug Costco BUT I buy only deals. Do your home work parents!
2,Leaves a residue,"Huggies are okay, but they are so thick, they leave little ""residue"" behind. Not sure exactly how to explain it, but it's like little cloth balls. Not good for a baby girl. They aren't too soft either. The Pampers wipes are perfect. I would recommend Pampers over Huggies."
5,Great for Adults too,"I keep this over the tank for a little wet wipe if needed. I find huggies work the best from all the other brands we tried. However, I've been getting them on sale from my local supermarket for $2 each (that's $16 for a pack of 8)."
5,Larry Garner's strength is his storytelling,"Larry's blues stand out because he knows how to construct a story around an experience he's had, and wrap it up as a tasty blues song. 'Jook Joint Woman' is a good example, which describes the antics of 'a fun-loving' fan at one of his live shows. 'Shut it down' (on the double dues album) is another good example, which begins with his kid having a bad day at school, and ends up with Larry getting quite philosophical about life. Larry also knows how to play guitar to great effect, sometimes reminiscent in style to fellow Louisiana bluesman Buddy Guy. Presented here are original and sometimes hilarious blues songs. This album is an appetizer for catching this fine entertainer live for a GREAT night out."
5,WWE Under Taker Action Figure,The figure was just what I expected. Great quality and fast shipping time. If I decide to get more WWE entertainment it will be through this seller!
5,An essential reference source for every genealogist,"Evidence! is one of the top ten genealogical reference sources published this decade. It should be in every library with a local history and genealogy collection. It sets the standard for documenting sources used by genealogists, and historians as well."
5,Genealogists Must Have!,"Every genealogist, amateur or seasoned, should by this as a reference book. Citing is key in genealogy and so is this book."
4,Great examples for common citations,This book gave me the help I needed by showing me how to cite my source
5,Helen Oxenbury Nursery Collection,"A marvelous, can't-be-beat collection of children's stories with beautiful illustrations.A perfect new baby gift!"
2,This Volume Sucks,"I'm a fan of WEW but this volume is unbearable. The commentators are annoying, and there's only a few matches that are not intergender. I would have given it only one star but the Candie vs BJ match was sexy and the Riptide/Angel Orsini matches are awesome."
3,what r u looking for?,"if u r looking for little to no wrestling with little to no talent with a lot of t and a than this dvd is for u, however you will see some notable wrestlers through out this series so if u find them cheap they r worth a look."
4,"Important stuff is here, but not his best album","Of course this is a great album. Who doesn't have their own ""Captain"" in their life? I play the Captain and the Kid whenever I feel maudlin. It touches a chord very deep within."
5,This is classic Jimmy Buffett!,This music captures the spirit of Jimmy Buffet's Key West experiences. Woman Going Crazy On Caroline Street and Havana Daydreamin are songs that tell stories set to great music. This is a must have for any serious Parrothead!
5,Classic Buffett,"This is Buffett when he was still making up his mind if he was a rocker, a folkie, a country balladeer, or a beach bum guitar player (of course, we now know he turned out to be all 4, which is why parrotheads love their leader so much). I'll admit I bought the cd mostly to get my hands on a copy of ""This Hotel Room,"" which ranks right up there in terms of the kind of Buffett song his critics hate and his fans love. I'm incredibly thrilled with the rest of it, though, especially the beautiful, lyrical, eccentric first track, ""Woman Goin Crazy on Caroline Street."" Buy this cd."
3,"Okay, I guess...",An odd tale about a love-struck pig and the things he does to get the attention of the object of his affection. I found it dreary.
3,Leon and Albertine - can't they just be neighbors?,"Now I know this is good clean French fun; I realize that the moral of this children's book is one of be yourself & love will follow. I get faintly queasy when I think of pigs & chickens falling in love. I wonder what we're teaching our children: that pigs can fly & chickens can oink? A funny story, nonetheless. END"
2,Not what I expected from Amazon!,"I received this item and it was as if someone had used it with dirt in my filter. I wrote to the customer service and got no response whatsoever. This is something that I've never expected from Amazon and I am somewhat pissed off with this particular shipment because I didn't get any reply from Amazon's customer service...no replacement of the product nor any response. However, I will give Amazon another chance to redeem their themselves in their customer service department when they get to read this complain about it. Obviously there is a flaw here and that has to be fixed so others won't run into the same scenario. Thanks for reading this review and hope Amazon will start notice their flaw in customer service; otherwise, customers will go somewhere else with better customer service."
5,Very good read,This book is stringly recommended for anyone interested in this subject. A good site to explore is www.rxsanity.org
5,"cogent, revealing, compelling reading","If you've ever stood at the pharmacy counter and wondered why the prescriptions you've just picked up cost so much, this book has the answers. Big Pharma - the major drug companies - need to make big profits, and the author explains how they use the money you pay them. She does it without being sensational or shrill, instead calmly laying out the facts of direct-to-consumer advertising, pharma-sponsored conferences, pharma-sponsored research, vacations and coffee mugs and big consulting fees for doctors. I for one had no idea of the extent of their reach, and I find it shocking and enraging. Big Pharma virtually sets the health agenda, and after reading this book I have a clearer sense of how they do it. I hope our politicians pay heed, and start fixing this disaster."
1,Prophets and personal prophecy/Dr. Bill Hammon,I recommend anyone that has received a prophecy read this book. It explained a time frame that prophecies may be filled.truly excellent book.The book brought forth much understanding.
2,Ordinary,"I cant help thinking this sounds like a cheap ""elevator music"" version of Lloyd Webber compositions not anything to do with the composer himself. I must be missing the point of making this album. For me there are other experiments in fusing rock and classical music which sound much better i.e. John Williams project ""SKY""."
2,OK Sometimes,"Unit works well sometimes but other times barely if at all.Seems to work poorly on days with rain or heavy cloud cover (think satellite TV signal problems).Also in cooler temperatures it will not lock on for 5 to 30 minutes, even though the batteries read and check well into the good.If the unit was on the dashboard or stuck to the roof of the car (impractical), it might work fine. Inside the car though, the operation is intermittent.When it works, it's pretty accurate. The software and reports are great.The magnet is very strong and will hold to any flat medal surface through a hurricane, I believe.Two stars may be a bit rough but if you were counting on the device to work every time from inside a vehicle, you would be disappointed."
2,Works Great - Breaks Quickly,"Amazing function in this little box. I had no problems making it work. The screen display of where my driver had been with the real time clock and MPH guage on the screen and showing his stops in red was all very nice. Nicer than I expected. It got wet one day with water inside. I shook out the water and let it dry. It continued to work after it dryed out. Within 2 changes of the batteries, part of the plastic inside where the spring is mounted that holds the battery in place broke. The plastic is very very thin to have spring tension pushing on it and with repeated battery exchanges. No warrantee. No exchanges. It's done after two trips on a truck."
1,GPS Tracking device,"I was extremely disappointed in this product because I couldn't get it to work at all, and there is no customer service contact number included to help me (or others like me who may be technically challenged). I would return it if I could."
4,Works great - software is a little confusing,"I bought one but was skeptical. Now I am a believer. Product functions great - easy to hide easy to use. No cables needed - it plugs directly into your USB port. I have the basics down but I do struggle with the software. It may just be me but after a year, I can still only use the basics ... on the plus side the basics are enough and the customer supprt is excellent."
1,not good to me,"If you want to get even close to your target stops don't count on it with the tracking key. It misses my stops anywhere from 2 blocks to 30 miles, as well as false MPH 186. The problem is that the tracking key has to be in direct view of the transmitter in the sky. If there is metal blocking the key then you'll get false data. Plus, if there is any kind of movement of the Key during transport (bouncing magnet) then you'll get false data too. It won't read inside buildings garages! If you want to catch your old lady or old man cheating be careful because it will show false data and blow everything like it did for me."
1,vehicle tracker,"Horrible, Horrible, Horrible!!! I read a bunch of reviews and decided to purchase this tracker. The screws do pop out when changing batteries, but whatever, be careful not to lose them. The magnet came off the second time I moved the tracker and I had to reglue it. The battery died very quickly. Not happy at all, returned product."
2,Installed but wont receive satellites,"Well not a good experience for me out of the box. Everything installed well but unit will not ""Cold start"" per the directions. I've installed, reinstalled, changed battery types (Energizer to Duracell and back again). I've installed the batteries and let it sit in the middle of 3 acres with no obstructions and a clear sky. I reinstalled the batteries and took it out on the highway immediately attached to the roof of my car, clear sky, no obstructions and drove for 30 minutes solid. I never get a flashing satellite green indicator. The battery indicator stays green but no satellite reception. I have to wait until Monday for their offices to open for technical support because nobody has reported this issue on the FAQs section of their website."
1,Pro use failed,I will be short and sweet... Worked fine for a few weeks died with no visable problems. Software very poor. Eats batteries every few days. Strong magnet. Customer service poor. I have been trying to find something by another vendor rather than getting another one from LAS.
2,m b,I received this item the package was already used. I did not purchase a used product. The CD would not download to my computer. I had to return the product and now searching for the same product from a company that will send an unused product. LandAirSea LAS-1505 Tracking Key Vehicle GPS Tracking System.
1,LandAirSea GPS Logger,Pros:SmallUses standard AAA batteriesBatteries last for a whileCons:My main gripe is that the downloaded data is in a .las format which even GPSBabel cannot interpret. This makes automatic geotagging of photos impossible.No on/off switch - you have to remove the batteries (which results in losing the small screws occasionally)Linux is not supported.
2,Couldn't get it to work.,"There is no direction booklet.The software that comes with the package is horrible. Complete not user friendly.I turned it on, and it couldn't even track where I was."
2,"I couldn't make it work, sorry !","I was extremely disappointed in this product because I couldn't get it to work at all, and the customer service contact number to help me was very difficult to reach. I followed the steps in order as there are written in the pack. Then I've placed the batteries, the lights went on in green but after a small drive in town with the car I tried to download the route and that was impossible or there were no data on the GPS.Software does not work with MAC computers and also when I installed on a PC it was almost impossible to make it work.I would return the item for a refund."
5,Land Air Sea GPS Tracking System,This is a great system for reviewing the driving habits and locations where the vehicle has been after the fact. I think the system would even be better if you were able to hardwire the device to the vehicle and view the information REAL TIME with Google MAPS. I think GOOGLE should come out with a device that does this even if you had to pay a monthly service charge I would be all over it.
3,It works,This tracker works as advertised.You have to find the sweet spot to install this on the vehicle so it can get a signal from the satellite and start tracking.The software is crap but it get the data in which you are looking for.
1,Lasted 3 days!,"Within three days my puppy had the two eyes and squeakers - all three of them - torn out. Too bad, it's a nice looking dog toy..."
4,Awesome,"An outstanding ""first CD"" by an extremely gifted and seasoned artist. A great opportunity to hear great performances from an amazing line up. PS: And very funky :-)"
2,"Impressive line up, but a bit hard on the ear","I was hoping for something a bit funkier - the personnel line up gave me great expectations, but it all sounds a bit stilted to me. Can't get excited about this one I'm afraid. Maybe if you like more of a bluesy rockier influence then this might be your cup of tea. I'm sure its great playing but nothing grabbed me."
4,not for the musically squemish,"Its nice to see someone who is not afraid to make a record thatmight not get played on the jacuzzi jazz stations that seem to define todays jazz. For all the great musicians that water down their art for the sake of acceptence its nice to see an honest musical statement by a worthy artist. This record reminds me of the type of music that was called jazz-rock or fusion 25 years ago and bit the dust when dumbed down records from Spyro Gyra,George Benson and Kenny G recieved wider public acceptance creating the current format that passes for jazz today. There is somthing to be said for maintaining your musical integrity as it is a rare quality in todays sales oriented market. Bravo Dean Brown!!! Dont give up the quest!"
5,WOW!!,"""Here"" by Dean Brown is a marvelous mixture of ALL the delicious elements of ""fusion""......equal-parts jazz, funk, & rock, this debut CD by one of jazz's most-dedicated & sought-after side-men is a gr8 listen...many times over!!..........and, with an incredible supporting cast of players (i.e.: George Duke, Billy Cobham, Marcus Miller, the Brecker Bros, David Sanborn, Bob James& numerous other veteran musicians...), this CD can't be beat!..It really ought to be considered as one of the years' best new releases.........let's hope for more magic from Dean soon!"
4,no saving the jews,Many Jews died in the holocaust because of what the United States did or failed to do. Especially the State Department and FDR. This well researched book details all of it . It does not go past the end of the war and our failures at that time. An important book well worth your time.It has real implications for today.
5,Abndment of the Jews In Italy,this was a very informative book and most enjoyable reading for those of us who are interested in the years before and during and after of the second world war.
2,History by Conjecture,"This is a highly influential book. Roosevelt has had many enemies growing out of his presidency. No one has had the same negative impact on Roosevelt's name to equal Wyman's attack. But, although Wyman, a professional historian has well-documented his research, much of the indictment of the Roosevelt Administration is based upon conjecture incapable of proof. The litmus test of his proposals was the bombing of Auschwitz. He asserts that the failure to bomb was due to a lack of caring. Thousands of Jews could have been saved. But there is no way to prove this. Many Jews could also have died because bombing was inaccurate and Jewish prisoners lived close to the crematoria. Too much in his charges is based on too little evidence. Peter Novick in his book, The Holocaust in American Life, calls Wyman's thesis a ""comfortable morality tale"" and ""bad history."" In addition to Novick, Henry L. Feingold, Frank W. Brecher, and William Rubinstein have written critically about Wyman."
1,Do Not Buy This,"I bought this even with the bad reviews. I have one of it's predecessors, a black one and it worked fantastically for 5 or 6 years. It still does but the on/off button finally died. I figured... how bad could it be? The one I have worked great until now.It's BAD. It's AWFUL. It's WORTHLESS. I've had to enter the codes for my tv and vcr 3 times today. The batteries are brand new... that's the first thing I tried. DO NOT BUY THIS. I only gave it a 1 because you can't give it a zero."
5,Nomad 2 docking station,It is simple to see that this is a neccessity for all people that like an easier and faster way to do things. This really is a hassle free way to download music from your computer; since it uses the USB port it downloads 5 times fater! what I like most about the docking station is that it is easy to put in and whenever I want to put new music onto my Nomad 2 it is right there. There is no downside to this product. Nomad is the best line MP3 players.
4,Quick and Reliable,"I recently purchased this product and found excellent. The Nomad II Docking Station allows quick downloads from your PC to the Mp3 player. Its small, compact and can be placed almost anyway. The rate at which it uploads a file is comparable to your usual USB cable. A 5 MB song takes about 15 secs to upload. Another great thing about this product is, unlike the ordinary cable, the Nomad II is so easy to use. Simply place the MP3 player in it and you are all set. Except for the high price, i really think this product is a must for all NOMAD II owners."
4,Well Done,Arrived quickly and safely. Didn't fit and was easy to return and the refund was quick. Very impressed as I always am with my purchases from Amazon.
5,Hunt's guide to the Upper Peninsula of Michigan,"This is a excellent book to take on your travels into the U.P. It is also a great book to plan your trip into the U.P. with. It gives great detail of every place,even the little gems along the way. I highly suggest getting this book if traveling into the U.P.,you will be lost with out it."
4,I Always Knew That Left Hands Were EEEvil!...,"DEMONOID concerns a demonized left hand that creeps, crawls, leaps, and kills! It also possesses those it chooses, and uses them to further its agenda of eeevil! Samantha Eggar (A NAME FOR EVIL, THE BROOD) tracks the horrid hand, after it destroys her husband. Stuart Whitman (NIGHT OF THE LEPUS) plays a priest w/ all of the enthusiasm of soggy communion wafers. DEMONOID is much maligned (some of it deserved), but is still better than a lot of what passed for ""horror"" in the 80s! Never a dvd release? Why not??..."
1,"""demonoid"" is just plain ""dumboid""","i saw this one at the movies in the 80's and got caught 5 mins. into it and thrown out. man did they do me a favor. this huge waste of time is the most unscary so bad it's bad horror of a horror movie that it doesn't need anyone to watch it to stink. just no good tale of devil's left hand taking people over and making them stupid. the worst, no stars"
1,oh jeebus,this movie made everyone i love hate me and i started abusing crack cocaine shortly after viewing it. leave it alone.
1,"The devil needs a new hand, and a new plot.","lame-o cheap-o, yada yada yada. Not even if you are a buff of terrible films should you check this'n out. plain and simple, i saw the same movie with Linda Blair and a crucifix scene. It is missin' all this and solid performances not even campy enough to make me laugh or huff or....somethin'. keep this one in the budget bin."
2,Disappointing,"I'm as big a Mantle fan as Kravetz but this book was a disappointment. It's more his personal diary about his friends and family, filled with ""Gee, whiz"" attitudes about Mantle, Baseball, and some very marginal players he idolizes. I liked his enthusiasm but found the book shallow and without insight. In addition, the book is apparently self-published and is full of typographical and syntax errors."
2,Be sure to have your dictionary on hand while reading...,"I honestly don't understand why professors choose this book to teach programming language concepts/semantics. The best books to learn from are written in simple, easy to read language, and with a well-designed index. EOPL lacks both of these attributes.As a part of the class we had to take reading quizzes on each section, meaning we had to read this book cover to cover. Friedman used complex, difficult to understand language to teach concepts that themselves were difficult to grasp. To make matters worse, the professor simply read from the book during lecture, failing to clarify the mysteries created by Friedman.An optional book for the class was Programming Language Pragmatics. It explained the implementations of Object Oriented languages, type checking, assembly, etc. using multiple languages people have used before, unlike scheme. I would suggest looking at that book before choosing EOPL."
2,Horridly Hard To Read,"The author of this book seems to have purposefully obfuscated every paragraph in this book. I had a course in Program Organization a couple semesters ago and this was the textbook for the class.I ""read"" the first few chapters, then gave up. I was tired of having to re-read every, and I mean every, sentence of the book multiple times in order to understand the topics covered."
2,Student view,"This book relies too heavily on the syntax of Scheme in the early stages. I find myself learning another language, and not new concepts. The title should be ""Essentials of Scheme.&quot"
5,Working as intended,Bought for my 95 vr as an oem replacemen since these are factory for mk3 vws. Also installed new wires and the tune-up seems to have gotten me more mpgs and a quicker response.
2,"Oops....Pay attention, now....","Oops. I should have paid more attention. I bought several books on hydroponics for my son's Science Fair project. I should've done a better job of reading between the lines on this one -- it's for growing, uh, less-than-legal, uh, weeds. Caveat emporum, dudes and dudettes."
3,Medal of Honour: Pacific Assualt,"I enjoyed this game through most of the missions. It has a training mission to learn the first person controls. Then you get into it. Some thought is necessary to complete missions successfully, I like. What I don't appreciate, in any game, is where the vehicle controls are made difficult just to make the game harder. You are able to fly an airplane, but the game doesn't support a joy stick. I know what has to be done for the mission and the task is made harder by the slow controls(having to repeatedly lift the mouse from the desk to turn), so even veteran gamers must repeat the same portion over and over. I could create a joystick profile. Load times can be long for missions and I needed to enable shaders 2.0 on my ATI graphics card to increase the speed of the game. I bought this game because I really enjoyed Brothers In Arms: Road to Hill 30. It's a different play experience than this."
1,Not able to play because of the video card requirements,Before you buy this game check that you have DirectX 8.1 enabled graphics card with at least 64 MB or more memory and one of these T&L capable chipsets: ATI Radeon 8500 or greater; NVIDIA GeForce3 or greater except GeForce4 MX. It will then be a waste of money. I would stick to Call of Duty!!!!!
3,Don't look here for realism,"Game can be fun except for a few things. The weapon reload time is excruciatingly slow, but maybe that could be part of my system. Also apparently the enemy wears body armor. It takes quite a few shots to bring one down. I also don't like getting stuck in arcadish type scenarios and have to complete those to advance the level. Why is MY character always the one that has to shoot the torpedoes out of the water or down the enemy aircraft. The rest of the fireteam doesn't utilize any other weapons or anything, they just sit and wait on me to do it all. The game does have excellent graphics and some decent, tense jungle fighting. It's probably worth buying now since it's achieved bargain bin status."
2,Don't bother!,"I was disappointed with the content. The pictures are delightful, and for that reason only, it got 2 stars. I found the story line thin, when in fact, the truth that we are ALL children of the King is really quite profound. Gigi is completely absorbed with herself - not a worthy role model. This is not because we don't suffer the same, but because she does not move from that position and it is not addressed or reinforced by anyone else in her life. Her father abdicates from the discussion, her mother gives her a one liner and her friend she considers her ""subject"". I thought Gigi was quite horrid!"
2,Missed the Mark,"I have to agree with some of the other negative reviews of this book. It is cute and had potential, but the character is very self focused and I feel like the emphasis on her being a ""princess"" takes presidents over the much more powerful message of God being King. I think it is sadly reflective of our Christian culture being more and more focused on US as the worshipers over God the one we are suppose to be turning our eyes to. I feel like it has confused my daughter since she frequently talks about being a REAL princess because she knows God. But, I feel like in her mind she is confusing this with being dressed in a dress up dress and living in a pink castle. It just isn't how I want her to understand her relationship with God, because ultimately, that is putting the focus on HER being glorified, not really a respect for God's place in her life."
2,Can't wait to read the ending....,"My 4-year-old daughter received this book - it was her gift she opened on Christmas eve. We sat by the lighted Christmas tree and fire and she settled into my lap for a goodread. The illustrations ARE precious, as other reviewers have said. The story started off beautifully - very believable for a little girl. We got to the part about ""the King"" and I got intrigued as to how the writer would explain this - then the book ended. It just ENDED. No further explanation, no further story. Just a few more pages would have turned this almost good book into possibly a great book. I am sad that it didn't make it - I had high hopes. Perhaps you might want to check it out from the library first to see what I mean. :( (I did give it 2 stars because of the sweet illustration and the beginnings of a good book.)"
4,A great book for someone's little princess.,"If you have a little princess at home, you will enjoy this book. It is perfect for the family who is religious. It doesn't talk a lot about religion but just enough to make it a nice story. This book would make a great baptism or first holy communion gift for all of ""God's Little Princesses."""
4,Very cute book!,"This is an adorable book with great illustrations. I wish that the story had more of ""God"" in it, the book is about 13 pages long and God was not brought into the story until the last 2 pages. I thought it was a cute lesson though, I know my daughter thinks she is a princess and it will be cute to teach her that God is The King and that is how she became a little princess, but once the ""moral"" was introduced, the story was over shortly after."
4,"Nice story, but a bit long","I brought this book for Three King's Day for my almost 3 year old daughter, but it was sooooo long that it was a bit hard to keep her interested until the end. I guess I figured if it is a board book it wouldn't be as long as a typical book.I also purchased Will the Mighty Warrior for my son and it is also as long. I am hoping that they will eventually appreciate the message."
2,too many vocals,"Don't get me wrong: I love Charlie Barnet. But I love the instrumental Charlie Barnet. I think the only vocal number of his band that I like is 'Deed I Do,' which I actually love. The majority of numbers on this album are vocal or vocal-enhanced, and the result is plebeian. The songs just don't have the drive of his instrumentals, except in little pieces, which defeats the purpose, since the drive of a song is built up over its entire length. These vocals act like unwelcome interruptions. If I didn't enjoy Charlie Barnet as much as I do, this wouldn't bother me, but I feel like I got robbed on this album. I feel the same about most of Tommy Dorsey's albums; he had an absolute crackling band, and even Frank Sinatra ruined the sound. I like to hear the horns!"
5,Overlook martial arts dictionary,"Even though you can find everything on the internet these days,I still value this book as a quik reference.I loaned mine to a student who never returned it,so I needed another.Great price,great condition,fast delivery.VERY SATISFIED!!"
5,KING CRIMSON - LONG AWAITED MUSICAL GENIUS,"Since their debut album in 1969, Fripp and his entourage of brilliant musician lineups has eclipsed the primarily shallow work of his contemporaries. This box set typifies the ongoing Genesis of a vital musical voice that implores you and I to step back from mediocrity and share in the richness of great avante guard expression and state of the art electronic musical media. With music currently inundated with M-TV's lame excuse for real artistic expression, King Crimson is truly a breath of fresh air. Thank you Robert Fripp, for you have breathed life back into the dying art of rock music!King Crimson has evolved from a primarily social commentary fusion band into the very future of solid and meaningful music. Alas, Robert Fripp illuminates the darkness. Thank you!"
5,Simple Explination,"The other reviews are obviously from Crimso heads. Yes, I am one too. I have owned a copy of every KC LP on 8-track, Vinyl, Cassette, and now CD. This is the closest to jazz they have ever gotten. The price of the box is nothing compared to the value of the music. I personally enjoy the one with Ade playing drums the best. Go figure.A humorous note. I recieved this for christmas from my son (17). I bought him The Offspring ""Ixnay on the Hombres"" and Mozart's Requiem (he kept taking my copy!) I think I got the better deal."
5,Essential,"The ProjeKcts -- can't eat just one. Buy the whole box right now, because you'll end up owning them all anyways."
3,"Some good stuff, but mostly self-indulgent noise","This is a four CD set. Each CD is from a live show featuring some of the members from the current King Crinsom sextet. I think Fripp is on all of them. There are some very good parts on these discs, but most of this is just self indulgent noise. There's lots of bits of technical wizardry, but none of it is connected into a real musical piece or backed by a melody. In some cases, it sounds like some instrumental improvisations were just ripped out of the middle of a song and the music loses it's impact of its original context. It was probably good to see live (at least for awhile) but it doesn't translate well to disc. Much better examples of King Crimson live would B'Boom or Great Deceiver.Of the four discs, the second one is far superior to the rest. It is much more lyrical and melodic. It was available at one time as a single CD."
2,Hard to digest,"WARNING: This is not a conventional set of albums in any sense. It is a selection of tracks of their live improvisations. The tracks are experimental and do not have structured themes in a conventional sense. As a musician, I am throroughly amazed by what they played, and may never figure out what they played. However, this is mostly very hard to listen to unstructured improvisations. One day, King Crimson will release albums developed from ideas explored in these improvs. Buy this only if you want to hear musicians exploring new territory. (And believe me, musical exploration developes at a turtle's pace! Just try developing your own musical style and you'll see what I mean! It usually takes years! This is just the beginning of a long, long journey.)"
2,Hard to digest,"WARNING: This is a recording of improvised experiments. It does not contain structured songs, but consists of mostly unstructured improvisations. Better to wait for a finished product from them after the ideas are developed fully into compositions. It is very challenging to listen to (and boring most of the time). Most of what they are playing is still a mystery to me, and I may never figure it out ever."
3,hit and miss,there are far better compilation packages to get from bb king. this one feels a bit off and from the layering of certain tracks. you don't get all that is advertised on here and yes there are way better bb king compilations to get.
1,Poor quality,"I did a lot of research before I bought this clock because it had all the features I wanted. The design is good, but the quality was so poor that I strongly recommend against purchasing this product.All of the plastic was of a very cheap quality, and numerous buttons kept breaking. I took this stupid clock apart 4-5 times to fix various buttons that quit working. Finally, I couldn't fix the back button, and so when setting anything (time, alarm, etc.), if I overshot my intended setting I had to go ALL the way around to get back again (which took a LONG time).Also, the spring on the CD cover quit working--didn't reduce the functionality since I could lift it by hand, but speaks to the overall poor quality of this product.I finally dug my old clock out of the closet (the one I bought this one to replace), and threw this one away! It's junk."
4,Good product once it works.,"I purchased one of these GE clocks and found that there were no instructions on the clock in the box. Actually there were, but to a different clock by GE.The automatic time set ""did not"" work, the clock is more complicated than others and I, to this date still have not been able to locate a manual on this thing. I have addressed it directly to GE and have not been redirected to anyone or even heard from them yet.I have figured out the settings of the time, wake alarms etc..., but still have yet to figure out how to set the day. The week bar up top just continues to flash and anoying the crap out of me.The product is rather neat in appearance and has great features and it is for that reason I give it a 4 star. If it were for the service in which a person gets when it comes to locking for product knowledge, I give it a ""1"", and that's generous."
2,It's a mystery to me still,"I got this tape when I believe a reviewer had it on his all time worst list. Talk about unstructured, with a pretense of a plot, but just general zaniness, although not slapstick. It is done by a repertoire company on a wooden stage, sort of like a theater in the round, and is perhaps set in Appalachia. Hard to tell if the audience is part of the company, or part of the populace. To say it is weird is an understatement.It is very unlikely one will ever see a stranger movie. For younger viewers (but over 18!) the movie captures the hippy atmosphere of the 1960's. Not for the average tastes. But not vulgar either. Just very strange."
4,Not as Merry,"In ""Forth and Abroad,"" readers get more of a history lesson of the Roswell Poor Clares' five foundations than an inside peek of what it means to be a Poor Clare. It is an interesting read, but lacks the personal touch, humor, and character descriptions that made ""A Right to be Merry"" so delightful. Readers will certainly get a sense of a community that is willing to grow and change with the call of God. A good book for the history of the Poor Clares in the 20th century."
3,Some Features Need Redesigning,"Considering how expensive Mauviel items are, they still need a couple of improvements that could easily be implemented.PROS: Fairly thick steel & copper. Good weight.CONS: The lid fits VERY badly - needs a much tighter fitting lid. The handle gets very hot - the pot handle needs to be redesigned to incorporate an open triangle where the handle attaches to the pot to dissipate heat. Same thing for the lid handle."
5,AWESOME!,"My best friend just had a good friend commit suicide. the kid was 16 years old. the song ""How Do You Get So Lonely"" seemed to fit so perfectly well. It was exactly like that. his parents were truckers that just seemed to forget about him... he was doing substance abuse and he was having a hard time. so this was an awesome song."
2,remember the code,"at first i loved this remote. it is a good size and has glow in the dark features which were useful. however it seems to constantly need to be reprogrammed. everytime i go to use it nothing happens ands i have to go through the whole code search process again, which takes about six minutes and have to wait right there so i can press enter once it finds the code. it works then for about 24 hours and i have to do it again. i will be looking to replace this remote immediately."
2,Not what I expected.,"Clock looks good but is a little larger than I expected. Was majorly disappointed that the ONLY way to get the Time AND Temp was to have it set for an hourly announcement of such. There is NO WAY to get the Time AND Temp with the push of one button. As was mentioned elsewhere in the review section this is a big inconvenience to do in the middle of the night. Could not get the outside temp device to sync up with the main unit. Maxi-aids would not respond to requests to return item. To me this is $50 bucks down the drain.Oh, and how nice is it to have a temp setting this five degrees off from the other thermometers in the house? The atomic clock did sync up.Don't waste your money if you're looking for a bedside clock to touch and get the time AND temp with the push of one button, there are others at a fraction of the cost."
3,good product that needs a power source,I bought one for a neighbor who cannot see. She absolutely loves it. There is only one issue in that she cannot change the batteries. She has gone days without it when the batteries are dead and I am out of town. This is a product that desperately needs an AC power source.
3,"Returned it, wrong alarm clock!","Didn't need, they didn't return my credit yet. Can't get a hold of anyone before hand to ask them questions."
3,Nice looking but inferior mechanism,"Great looking watch that keeps time okay. However, the timer functions worked only for a few days and then became inoperable. I don't use the timer on the watch at all, but it is annoying that it broke so soon after I bought it. I have received several comments on the beauty of the watch. It is a good looking watch and people will notice it. It is just the right size."
5,momof5,"I bought this watch for my 21 year old son for Christmas in 2009. He loves it and wears it often to school but does not wear it to work. It keeps good time, is very stylish and he has received many compliments on it."
5,Best I've Heard,This is the best collection I've heard of drum + bass music I've heard in a while. It's also really cool because it has some of my favorite hip hop rappers like Kool Keith and Bahamadia.
5,Truly classic stuff,"Small-group recordings by Clarence Williams from the period 1929-1937 show that he should be ranked with King Oliver, Louis Armstrong and Jelly Roll Morton as one of the top pioneers of jazz. Here we have wonderful versions of pop songs, jazz classics and blues, performed with zest and spirit. Instrumentalists like Willie 'The Lion' Smith, Fats Waller, James P Johnson, Cyrus St Clair, Henry 'Red' Allen and Lonnie Johnson all contribute masterfully to the total picture. A timeless gem, for sure."
5,Great for kitchen counter!,"I purchased this television for my kitchen. I wanted a television that would blend in nicely with stainless steel appliances and not take up too much counter space. I've received many compliments about the television. The picture is great and the price, even better. I checked with Best Buy, Circuit City, and Gramaphone, before choosing Amazon.com, which had the best price."
4,Good choice for kitchen TV,"Very happy with the picture. Would prefer smaller size speakers on the sides, as they make the TV look much bigger than the screen itself.One time it started broadcasting ABC in Spanish......with all commercials in English and all adjacent channels in English. Cable company had no answer. By next morning it was fine, so I can't hold that against it.Good choice for the $$$, although it is not HD. Very light and easy to move."
4,Great deal,"Used this overseas to charge batteries using a generator, really nice quality unit. Like the various terminal ends supplied, both clips and bolt-on connectors. Liked the removable power cord, allows for use of country specific power cords if you don't have proper adapter. Didn't so much like the large storage box for all these cords that is attached to the charger. But for some this might be a nice feature."
3,OK for internet research,"This book offers very little you can't find using a good search engine. In fact, the majority of the book is web addresses, and almost all of them are citations from the same address. Spend you money elsewhere."
4,Tab- Not bad,"This is a very nice, very valuable representation of this wonderful roots, Houma Louisana Bluesman Tab Benoit. He is a real nice player, gutsy vocals, great guitar work, Hammond organ which is a must. Worth the purchase for sure."
2,Where's the beef?,"The concept of this book is Excellent: a blending of spiritual and material. All of our labor should be so inspired by God! The meditations and scripture readings were well thought out. However there are only a couple pages per chapter!! I need more actual content in order to help inspire change. It is like talking about what you want to say without saying it. I know that the authors wished to write briefly for busy moms, but this is in sacrifice of all the rich content the authors could have shared with all their vast experience. Examples and details and at least 10-30 pages of writing per chapter would have been needed to really fulfill the purpose of this great concept of a book."
5,Great book.,I got this book for my mother for mother's day since she just bought a new house. She is really pleased with the book. Very satisfied.
5,Wonderful,"Do yourself a favour - buy anything by Lily Brett, and buy it today. She is a superb writer. Just Like That is one of my personal favourites, but any of her books (fiction and non fiction alike) will satisfy if you crave for quality literature with a personal (almost confessional) feel. Her characters are wonderful, you really care about them and feel almost as if you know them. Her poetry is amazing as well. I really cannot do justice to Brett's work....so you had better buy this book yourself."
1,Broke Almost Immediately,"There's nothing quite like the feeling of spending big bucks on an electronic gizmo and having it fail right away. This happened more than two years ago, and I'm still angry! Belkin lost a lot of credibility and all of my business when this pricey keyboard turned out to be a cheaply executed dud."
1,Don't buy this,Some of the keys get stuck before pressing down. The mouse is so very slow. I can't believe the MSRP. I paid $40 and that was still way more than what this thing's worth. I wonder who decided to print some of the text in blue on this black keyboard. I have to stop and flash it back and forth in direct light to read what the buttons at the top do. This keyboard is a really poor design.
1,Beware of this keyboard !!,"key problems occured in 1 month. (especially ctrl, windows key, alt key, and lots of regular keys) now its totaly gone. same problem with two of my friends , gone in 2~ months.if you`re looking for a good wireless keyboard for your htPc, try Logitech DiNovo Edge /"
4,Does what I wanted,"I have about 30, from my couch to my HTPC and keyboard works fine. Universal remote functions were set very easy."
2,Key problems left and right,"The other reviewer is right about stiff keys. Initially I had one key get completely get stuck, plus that the trackball would not move in one direction. Belkin replaced the unit without any questions asked (no RMA problems for me), but the new unit is occasionally very stiff. It takes more force to press keys than a good keyboard should need.The most annoying problem is that occasionally keys get dropped. I can type fine for a whole day, and then there will be a minute or so where keys are simply ignored. You can hit them ten times and only one gets through.It's a pity, because this is the only wireless keyboard that I could find without hex keypad, which I need for space reasons.Btw, this review is for the MediaPilot product that works over RF. Amazon lists two very similar Belkin keyboard that both look like mine."
2,Bad Keyboard,"Could be great if the keys didn't stick. If you are looking for an HTPC keyboard for rare use since you'll be using a remote control 99% of the time, you might be able to put up with the keys. Otherwise, I would have junked this thing a long time ago."
2,"Hard to read, yet disturbing book","I bought this book at an airport thinking it would be a light read, not so, there is simply so much information to take in - which really works against the book, I might add.In essence it pieces together various eyewitness accounts of the tragedy, and looks at the two enquiries launched on both sides of the Atlantic.There are two authors to this book, one whom advocates a conspiracy theory that the Titanic was swapped with her sister ship the Olympic for the purpose of insurance fraud, the other certainly believes none of it.Whatever the truth is, it seems likely that there was some measfeasance on the part of the White Star Line and it makes very interesting reading peering into it's ultra complicated ownership structure which veiled the true owner, JP Morgan.What works against the book is its difficulty to read, it just does not flow properly and I found myself skipping pages which seemed to repeat the same information over and over again."
4,The Rev rev's it up!!,"This CD was the first really good Rock and Roll XMAS CD I have ever heard from an individual artist. I was shocked that Yep Roc did not do a better job getting this into stores and out there for public consumption. I did not see this in any retail outlet. ""Jingle Bell's"" simply smokes, and ""Santa looks a lot like Daddy"" was an instant classic to me. As mentioned in earlier reviews, the Rev's vocals did not exactly fit some of the slower #'s, but overall, this CD is a XMAS classic, and rocks like hell, WOW. It will be interesting to see if it is looked upon down the road as a landmark XMAS release for Rock and Roll fanatics."
4,great change of pace,If you've got We Three Kings and Elvis' Christmas album you're set for the holidays.
3,This is OK.,"I like the beat and Nas uses a different style on the song, but the singing has to go! It almost ruined the whole damn song! I have high hopes for his upcoming album. His last one was dissapointing."
5,Glorious!,"The famous male duet of this opera has popularized the theme that runs through the entire second act. Almost guaranteed, you'll be singing/humming along. Voices are clear, well recorded and wonderfully balanced."
3,"i'm a huge admirer of sor juana, but .......","even i, with the greatest of interests in, and an affinity for - the woman, her life, her writing, the time period, the country, etc .... am having difficulty refraining from skipping over huge sections of this book. my suggestion = read alicia gaspar de alba's sor juana's second dream, instead. hers is a beautifully imagined and cleverly crafted literary work - less than half the number of pages, and well worth the reading of every word! unfortunately, because it was put out by a small/university press, her novel never reached the readers it deserved."
2,A Supreme Test of Patience!,"Many times I wanted to strangle the author for writing this book! I have no idea why I picked it up! I thought perhaps, (this book being so big), it would have some great things to say. Alas, it is really Ambien in book form! It was too long and tedious, too many times. I kept wondering why the author needed over 1300 pages to say what he wanted to say. I recommend this title for those who are bibliophiles and want a good challenge. It is literally a mountain of reading! Even Tolstoy would have been challenged by such erudition. After you pass the winter with this title, use the book as a doorstop. Or you can make it a curious gift to a an office colleague you don't like too much! It can also be a good teaching aid to ESL students who wish to improve their reading skills. Still, you will have a feeling of accomplishment when you finish it. Good Luck! Don't say I didn't warn you!"
4,Definitive compilation,"4 1/2Saint-Sans' sublimely constructed set of underrated romantic epics are all marvelously impressive, and Martinon's working sounds thorough enough to ensure ears wouldn't need to wander to other sources."
3,"Not perfect, but decent","The keyboard is alright considering that in was very inexpensive compared to others. After a while, it does get sort of boring. I have had this keyboard for about a year, and you eventually get tired of hearing the same thing over and over. The only real feel of diversity you could get from this machinery is if you have a home music studio on your pc. Then, if you hook up your keyboard, you can add to the diversity of your music program. Considering the money spent, I would say that it is a very decent buy."
4,good 4 beginners,"my parents bought me this keyboard when i was 10 to practice on,, and now im 14 and playing advanced level, so its not much use to me anymore because i need more octaves.. but i learned to play on it, its the only keyboard i had and it,, . well anyway,, if you're a beginner and want something to practice on and dont have space 4 a real piano, this is the thing 4 u:) the only downside is that u have to buy batteries if u dont have the adaptor:("
2,Cheaper? I DO think so!,"There are many keyboards that are cheaper than this one that offer stereo sound, a back lit LCD display, Yamaha's Education Suite or very similar program, and even TOUCH SENSITIVE KEYS. Many are, in fact, in the Yamaha line of PSR portable keyboards. Please research more thoughouly before you come to wrong conclusions, which may mislead others."
4,Great Tasting Boba! Some were turned to powder though...,"Not sure if it was the shipping that caused it but when I received the bag, about 1/4 of it was completely powdered. The boba itself was much dryer and more crumbly than I expected, but when it was boiled it turned delicious! I wish that I could have used the last quarter of the bag for boba, but right now I can make a big layer of jelly with it but not much else.Would order (and am about to) again, but hopefully won't get too much powder this time."
3,"Decent, but too small","I prefer the tapioca to be bigger.For bigger tapioca, try:Bubble Tea Black Tapioca Pearl (2.2 lbs). I bought this one before and will buy this one in the future instead."
3,These are just Okay,"I bought a really big bag of these tapioca pearls, not realizing the weight was in kilograms, not pounds. The tapioca pearls are quick to cook, but I found them to be a bit gooey in texture. I prefer the firmer texture of the ""pre-cooked"" tapioca pearls, as opposed to these, but not too bad."
2,Isn't so premium,"What was sent to me was the 5-minute black pearls, which consist of tapioca starch, other starches, guar gum, methylcellulose (a filler), DHA (a preservative), SDA (a firming agent), flavoring, coloring, agar, and vitamin C. This is not the premium black pearls which consists of just tapioca starch, caramel color, and a potassium sorbate (preservative). So there is less filler in the premium and more tapioca. Also, this affects the texture and taste when cooked. With the premium, it is chewy but not rubbery, like the 5-minute boba is. I also find the 5-minute has a more acidic aftertaste than the premium. On the plus side for the 5-minute, it is more firm in the packaging and not likely to be easily crushed like the the premium, which requires special care when storing (which is why I gave this 2 stars). I published a picture to show what I received. From past reviewers, it doesn't appear they received this so I'm not sure why I got what I did."
4,Good DIY Pearl for Bubble Tea,"I've been looking for a pearl that doesn't turn out horrible at home. These were not the best I've had, but not the worst by far. They turned out to have a good texture- not super chewy/ not hard and pealing. They cooked for only about 17 minutes and were fine. They tasted much better than the minute pearls and not as slow as some other brands.The bag is HUGE! I wasn't sure what to expect, but these should last us for some time. If you can't find the large pearls locally and need to order online these have a lot of bang for your buck. When I calculated the size to shipping ratio for my area it was equal to purchasing the smaller box at the store (if I could ever find them). Not a mind-blowing amazingly delicious pearl (what tapioca pearl is though), but they hit the spot and I don't regret buying the larger package."
3,Schlock Theater,"First, let me just say: Wow. This book is like a 70's drive-in creature feature where you can see the zipper on the monster's back. It's entertaining in a throw-your-popcorn-at-the-screen kind of way, but it's also hilariously and unbelievably bad. (And a cheap rip off of Graham Masterton's THE MANITOU.) A woman grows a monster on the back of her neck and after several attempts by doctors to remove it (it grows back at one point) the monster is born and the woman runs around with a bloodthirsty critter attached to her back. I was laughing hysterically through the last 50 or so pages when the monster grows legs and starts carrying the woman around on it's back and runs loose in a mall with a SWAT team chasing it. If you enjoyed old horror movies like IT'S ALIVE and BASKETCASE, then you'll have fun with this book. I'm giving it three stars because I appreciate the kind of horror schlock that inspired it, but again let me just say: Wow."
3,not a great training tool,"this didn't help train my son at all. it made him think that you have to push your tummy to pee. however, he had fun smashing the tummy and watching the water come out. now he uses it just as a baby doll (cuddles it & puts it to bed). its a neat toy but i wouldn't use it to potty train."
4,This video is for all exercise levels.,"I used this vidreo after the birth of my first son. After getting used to the routine on the floor, I invested in a step. I went from low impact to high. Even though I got stonger, the workout is still challenging and invigorating. If you want to buy just one video that will grow with your abilities; this is the one!"
3,Not what I thought,This is a catalog for a store selling Montessori products. It gives an overview of Montessori principles on each page and advertises products for sale on each page.
3,not a book,"Fair warning: this is a catalog with some text across the top of each page. While the text is interesting and I like having the images of the items right below where they're discussed, I was expecting something else for the cost. You can read the text on the Michael Olaf website for free."
5,Great Necklace,"I just got my necklace and it's PERFECT!!! I wear a lot of Native American pendants and this compliments them beautifully! The pics don't do it justice and it's nice and heavy for it's size, not at all flimsy :)"
4,Interesting tidbits about OKC history,"The book does an interesting job of describing the early days of OKC, specifically the turf wars and fights between the two groups of settlers known as the Kickapoos and Seminoles (note: these were the names of two warring factions of settlers; they are not the indian tribes). Great read for anyone interested in those early days of OKC. My only complaint would be that the book largely assumes that you already have a knowledge about these two groups and the players. Probably not a great choice for someone who isn't pretty well versed in OKC settlement. Also, it tends to go into a lot of detail of fights over particular plots of land, when individuals proved up, court cases individuals filed, etc... Invaluable historic information, but not ideal for someone just wanting a general overview of the Kickapoo/Seminole fights."
4,Ping! played by Brian Donovan,"The thing I know about the movie is that according to the Internet Move Database, The person who's the voice of Ping! the Dog is Brian Donovan, the same person who played Digimon Season 2 character Davis Motamiya (remember that show)."
3,Not so great.,"Guttermouth is an awesome, hillaroious,talented punk band, but this live album just isnt up to their standards. This album is froma long time ago, before such amazing albums such as teri yakimoto, and musical monkey were made. This album consists of songs from full length, and very friendly people. The recording isnt that good, and it doesnt do justice to what one of their live shows is really like. Their shows are just plain awesome. mark is one of the coolest punkers ever, and they sound so incredible. If you love guttermouth like I do, and don't want to be disapointed, don't buy this album. Wiat for their next release, and just keep litening to the sweet tunes of their other great albums"
5,One of the best books I've ever read,"I had been a committed Christian for about 20 years before I read this book. I have read most of the classics of Christian faith - The Bible (of course!), Foxes Book of Martyrs, Mere Christianity, Pilgrim's Progress, How Then Shall We Live?, and more. All of these books are great.The most life changing one for me was the Bible (obviously!), followed by Classic Christianity. Eight years later I still read Classic Christianity occasionally for refreshment and also lend it to friends. It greatly improved my walk with Jesus. My friends who read it for the first time have a similar impression. I am going to order more copies to give away."
5,"Just finished ""Classic Christianity"" and absolutely loved it","I was going to let my wife read it next, but I think I'm going to read it to her myself so that I can enjoy it again. I can hardly wait to get started on the ""Classic Christianity Study Guide"" and I just ordered ""Grace to You"". Keep up the good work Mr. George. God Bless you."
1,Classic Christianity by Bob George,"(This should have appeared with a 5-star rating) A must for everyone who believes they are ""born again,"" and for anyone who is not a ""believer"" and is seeking to understand true Christianity. Guaranteed to awaken the reader to basic truths that are more often than not overlooked (if not avoided or totally misunderstood to begin with) by much, if not most of the contemporary Christian world. This book has literally changed my life. I wish I could have been exposed to this liberating teaching decades ago--but then, better late than never..."
5,Get out of legalism and into life!,"Classic Christianity artfully weaves a beautiful tapestry picture of the history of salvation from Adam and Eve to the New Covenant while providing picturesque everyday parables that both the young and old can grasp with ease to know and understand the full measure of God's love, mercy and grace for them. If your feeling the trudge and weight of legalism in your relationship with Christ then this is the book for you! If you have further questions after reading it, then check out the People to People live radio ministry at: realanswers.net or listen to the radio archives."
5,"The Best Book I have Ever Read! (well, next to the Bible)","God used this book to free me from trying to be the Super-Christian. I had no clue about the New Covenant and what Jesus did for me by fulfilling the Old Covenant by nailing it to the cross. For so many years I sat under teaching that left me feeling guilty and wondering if God really loved me enough to forgive all of my sins. After reading Bob George's book, the scripture jumped from the pages of the book and into my heart. God was setting me free from a life a legalism and being unsure of my status with God. If you've ever wondered which book to read to begin a journey - this is it. It's a journey of a lifetime and one that never gets old."
4,Classic Christianity,"This book will help those who struggle with the actualization of God's love.He loves and accepts us as we are despite our past, present or future sins!How awesome is that!"
5,It's all about grace in Christ,"Practical & in language for the layperson, as well as the theologian, this book is a must read & a must share for those who desire to understand the grace believers in Jesus Christ can& should enjoy. The Lord never intended the Christian life to be one of frustration & defeat. My regret is not finding this book years ago. The truth will set you free!"
5,Well researched and a tale well told,"Don't confuse this book with the ""GI Joe collector's guides"" that exist in various forms. This is a different animal - - gripping, well-written nonfiction, telling the story of a small family-owned business and its leap of faith on a brand new type of toy for boys, the now-ubiquitous ""action figure.""The story of the GI Joe product illuminates the story of the toy industry itself. I found this look inside the process of bringing a product to market and maintaining its value over the course of decades fascinating."
5,A great inside story of the joe world.,For anyone who grew up with gijoe as a back yard play mate this is the book for you. You will be amazed at the behind the doors work that went on to bring gijoe to life. This is a fascinating story of joe and how he came to life his rocket to stardom and then fade to twilight. A must read for any joe lover and collector. 5 stars
4,Modern Glasow Crime,Peter Turnbull is an excellent chronicler of Glaswegian Crime. The officer's of P division look beyond the face value of a murder as the result of a brawl.
1,Not Well Made,I ordered 2 of these hoods and both of them arrived with the rubber part already halfway detached from the mount. I never even had a chance to get it on a lens.The two parts couldn't even be snapped back together as the rubber part was just slightly larger than the mount. Very disappointing!I've requested a full refund.
2,"Worst printer ever built, ripoff on the toner","I feel like a sucker. I got this laser printer 2 years ago and it's nothing but paper jam and toner empty alerts. One one color toner is out, the whole printer cannot be printed. I only use most of the black ink printing, but for some reason the color ink alerts always come on. Every single time, I try to print something there would be some sort of error. I got this printer when it was $3000, in less then 2 years it's only selling for $289. Sucker me."
5,It is time to accept the truth!,"Denying reality never has helped mankind's progress. So instead on complaining about reality one ought to read this book, best combined with ""The blind watchmaker"" written by Richard Dawkins, and accept reality, even though it might be painful: No ""god"" ever has ""created"" man (btw: who would have ""created"" the ""creator"" then?) but man developped through billions of years of evolution. It may hurt, but face it!"
4,A nice slice of old Jamaican ska,"This is not actually a far-reaching, overall introduction to the ska style, as such, but rather a collection of old tunes taken from the archives of one particular label, Jamaican producer Vincent ""Randy"" Chin's work for the pioneering Federal label. Although these are vintage recordings, made between 1960-65 and feature many of the biggest names in Jamaican ska (the Skatalites, The Maytals, Don Drummond, etc.) these aren't necessarily the most classic, immortal songs of the genre. Still, collectors and newbies alike will find this a vigorous and rewarding collection, on a par with the Studio One reissues Rounder Records has been putting out over the years."
5,This CD Rocks,"Bueno is a mix between Pennywise and Propagandhi... If you like any of these bands you will like Bueno. The CD has only four songs on it, but the songs are pretty long. Also this is an interactive cd with older songs, videoclips, suggested reading, explanations of the songs and articles on current issues, written by the band and their friends.This is one of the best punk from the past year! Watch out for this young, promising and upcomming bands!"
5,steptoe and son series 1,"Brilliant movie, just would like to purchase it for playing it in America. Do you know where I can purchase one from?Many thanks"
3,Heavy and clunky!,"This is nothing what i expected. I have a $70 Peugot Stainless Steel watch that I would pick any day of the week over this one. It's large face is heavy and not low profiled at all. I felt like I was in handcuffs. I don't really get how this watch is over $200.00.I returned it immediately. If you are a picky watch wearer, I don't recommend this watch for you."
5,AS GOOD THEN AS HE IS NOW!,"One thing about George Strait in retrospective is that it's difficult to hear much change in his early music and his current offerings. It's almost like he hit the road running and has never slowed down.Some have accused him of having too many songs. Funny. Mozart had the same problem in his day and I suspect, from a Country Western standpoint, that we will be listening to George Strait music for decades after he is gone.While STRAIT FROM THE HEART is one of George Strait's earliest albums it is as listenable today as it was when it climbed the charts with such classic hits as FOOL HEARTED MEMORY, MARINA DEL RAY and AMARILLO BY MORNING.Whether you're new to Strait's music or an old fan like me, STRAIT FROM THE HEART will become a favorite.Douglas McAllister"
5,THE BEGININNING OF A GREAT CAREER,"This is the CD that made George: It is an incredible CD, classics like ""Marina Del Ray"", ""A Fire I Can't Put Out"", ""Heartbroke"", ""Steal Of The Night"", ""I Can't See Texas From Here"", ""Amarillo By Morning"", and ""Honky Tonk Crazy"" speak for themselves. This is without question one of his best CDs, but NOT his best. There is nothing negative I can say, it just does not have a particular favorite song of mine, say like ""Something Special"" or ""The Road Less Traveled"".This is one excellent CD that should be in any country fan's collection, EASY 5 STARS."
5,essential for any true music fan,"The second album from George Strait makes him the ledgend that he is. With the CLASSICS such as Amarillo by Morning, Fool Hearted Memory, and Marina Del Ray it is sure to become a favorite but the best may be the exceptional album cuts. Any fan of his will love such selections as Honkey Tonk Crazy and The Only Thing That I Have Left (my personal favorite George Strait song). This is definately a cd that i ALWAYS leave in my car because i never get tired of it."
4,Early George Strait album is a good one!,"This is Strait's second album, and has the only song of his he wrote which was included on an album on it (""I Can't See Texas From Here""). Has a lot of good songs including ""Heartbroke"" and ""Fool Hearted Memory"" and his classic ""Amarillo By Morning"" too. END"
5,My family wore this book out till it fell apart.,I have been searching for this book for years. It was the favorite of all my children as they grew up. First 3 daughters and then a son. It was the first choice of any book they would choose to have read to them while sitting in our laps and they howled with laughter during the reading. Many years ago I found this book in a second hand book store while browsing but our copy was not yet worn out. I have searched fruitlessly since then and researching articles for a late blooming college career I came accross Amazon books on line and wallah wallah there it was. Out of print but a faint ray of hope in trying to find it.
4,Grandaddy of time management,"This is one of those classics that seems to apply consistently over the years. It was done in 1983 and could be updated to reflect today's (2006) technology. I like to play the program in my car, but the next vehicle won't have a cassette player !I have also studied the time management ideas of Steven Covey and Neil Fiore. I can't help think that Covey repackaged this work by Douglass (1983). The idea of the time quadrant is presented here. I also like the very pragmatic and direct approach. This is a no nonsense coursethat needs to be formatted onto CD."
4,A Rediscovered Masterpiece,"Mimi and Richard Farina's work is probably the most underappreciated music to come out of the 1960's. The Best of the Vanguard years offers a sampling of the beauty, poetry and power that is their music. Though in some ways comparable to the many folk acts of the time, notably Bob Dylan, Richard and Mimi Farina's brand of folk is fresh and unique, even today. The arrangements, vocalizations and the Irish and Cuban influences blend together to make an almost hypnotic sound that is haunting, forceful and peaceful at the same time. The instrumentation is beautiful, the lyrics intelligent and witty, and the end result is a captivating collection of songs that will hopefully bring attention to these too-long-overlooked artists."
5,"""Different Songs For Different Reasons""","'Sara Evans - CMT Pick' is an enjoyable look at one of the most attractive country music artists today. While only 42 minutes in length its still enough time for the viewer to get a little insight into the woman behind the music and discover she's just as beautiful on the inside as she appears on the outside.This feature consists primarily of an interview with the star interspersed with segments of some of her music videos. She talks about her career, important landmarks in her rise to stardom and the importance of family to keep her grounded. Definitely an essential for Sara Evans fans."
4,From the ashes into the lignt,"Sara had a rough time of it for a while and we all wondered if she would be back. There is no question about it, she is back with a fantastic group of songs. Welcome back!"
5,Excellent antropological view of native cultures in Japan,"This is a book about the Japan that even Japanese urbanities unfortunately do not know. I recommend it for anybody seriously interested in the anthropology of the different native people of Japan and their heritage. It is easy to read and first hand report. I felt touched by the interviews. However, to have a whole picture, I suggest to read it after you know the stereotypes of Japan that are written in most of introductory books in the market, or better, after you live there for some time. I have read other books about indigenous people of other lands, and many times I finish with sadness, for the loss of their treasures and way of life. Preface of this book mentioned something that I felt very valuable. It said that Mr. Suzuki purported to show that such native people may provide a clue to the future, to our survival. I appreciate your message very much, Mr. Suzuki."
4,Easy to use cordless phone with clear instructions,"The GE 25951EE2 cordless phones where easy to setup. The documentation was clear and the phone worked as advertised. Voice quality was excellent. The one problem, was the handsets did not lock securely into the base or charging stations. This was particularly true of the remote handset where it some times took multiple tries to get the handset to stay seated in the charging station. Any movement caused the handset to loose connection to the charging station. Luckily the light on the charging station indicates whether the handset is properly seated and charging."
2,Disappointed,"I bought this phone because the 5.8 GHz was supposed to have better clarity than the 2.4 GHz phone that we had. We have been very disappointed as the clarity is poor and the volume even on the highest setting, does not seem to be high enough so it is difficult to hear the caller."
3,So-so phone set,"The best thing about these phones are that you can add on additional handsets,and you don't need a phone line to each one. The one thing I am not fond of is that you can't get very far from the base before they recieve interference and you are unable to understand the person on the other end."
4,It brings back memories,"It`s 6 years already, I had to go for a job ...and it stole my heart.The book shows it beautyfull, always changing nature at different season and the warm original places and towns. It`s mostely a picture book with the right lyrics that keeps the little details."
2,Reiterating Disappointment for Kindle Version,"While there already is a review highlighting the Kindle versions problems, it deserves repetition. The Kindle version lacks the illustrations and what makes this more regrettable is the fact that the description in the Kindle store took the description from the original paper copy and talks up the missing illustrations. There is also a forward in each book that is written by the illustrator discussing his work. Without the illustrations, the main factor for purchasing what are mostly public domain stories is lost."
5,A Masterful Story Teller,"Have a young son who doesn't want to read? Give him any book by REH. As pointed out by other 5 star reviwers this volume contains some of Howards best work. Read and enjoy. Mark Finn has examined Howard and his works inBlood and Thunder: The Life and Art of Robert E. Howardand places him in the Pantheon of great Southwest writers. For what it's worth, I agree. A parent wishing to develop a taste for reading in their young son would do well to introduce him to Conan; if said parent read the Finn book they could help guide their sons development, mix in an examination of Howards essay the Hybornian Age and you have a great way to teach geography, history and English all rolled into one."
2,Less to be desired,"When I received this item, I thought it was cool, small enough to carry anywhere and durable so I could listen for hours. Well, I was in for a rude awakening; when I tried to play back my downloaded songs, after about 1 hour of play the battery was already at two bars, then after 2 hours down to one. Needs constant charging. Also, shuffled songs keep playing over and over, making you sick of hearing the songs. I'm not surprised though, how could such a small unit possess longevity and good sequence. Nice try Creative Zen - but no cigar!"
3,Good but not perfect,"Product's pretty good. Got what I wanted & what I paid for. Only annoyance is the shuffle logic is ridiculous. Every time the player is switched to shuffle mode, it plays almost a fixed sequence of songs. Otherwise, everything else is quite good."
3,Creative Zen Stone Plus,"It's a great little mp3 player. It's basically a shuffle. You can make folders but that uses up more space so it's basically organization vs. amount of music. Plus definitely get a little case for it because mine got scratched up pretty quickly and I was very careful. I guess because it's such a small screen one or two little nicks are very annoying.You can choose language, sound settings (according to genre and there's a custom setting), there's fmradio with tons of presets. It's definitely worth sixty bucks! I recommend it."
4,Just what my wife wanted for walking.,"This clearly satisfied her request for something ""small, simple to use and has a radio"". It works and sounds fine but we need to work out one bug - its charge indicator light does not flash when it becomes fully charged which is supposed to be in under 4 hours from a USB port; after eight hours I gave up on it figuring that it is likely fully charged after that long. One thing I think Creative should have included was a clip to attach the unit to your clothing. Yes it easily fits in any pocket but some people I know wear clothes with no pockets when they go walking.One other thing, my wife's computer is still happily running Windows 98 and does everything she uses it for. However, this unit will not connect to 98. With so many USB flash drives out there that work fine on a 98 machine would it have been all that much trouble for Creative to have included 98 connectivity?Neither was a 'show stopper' though; it's a good purchase."
2,"cute, but no cigar","Great looking device , but doesn't allow DRM type files to play. Also the shuffle ""once"" function doesn't work as advertised. You will hear songs played twice. For the money, go for the Zen V players. I have one of those and it works and sounds great."
3,Maple Chairs,The chairs look good and are okay quality. There was a missing bolt and we are stiill waiting to here from Amazon about how to get the missing bolt so the chairs will last a long time.
2,Not so good...,"I purchased this product because of the scent combination. Bergamot scented soaps are kinda difficult to find. The smell was just wonderful; nice and aeromatic, not to strong. When I started using it, the soap would suds very little and the scent went away after rinsing. Same is not worth the money. Very poor product."
4,"""Mrs. Peel... We're needed...""","Amongst those who have seen last summer's motion picture ""The Avengers"", and had no idea what it was about (I never saw the show beforehand, but had a lot of background info to start with) now's your chance. It's also the chance for many fans of the original ""Avengers"" to cash in on the suspense series' first run on the video market. But this is just Volume 1, Trilogy 1. So far eight other volumes have been released from 1967, and inevitably other seasons will come. For now though, this is the place to start!"
2,say what?,"I thought that this would be a classic DJ Clue mix tape, basically hip hop with various artists. It was some artists that I had heard before but the music? All I could say was WHAT? I hadnt heard any of these songs before but they were not good!"
2,EAST COAST JUNK !,"I DON'T LIKE DJ CLUE,I DON'T LIKE JAY-Z,I DON'T LIKE MEMPHIS BLEEK BUT I DO LIKE METHODMAN NOT REDMAN.THIS CD IS NOT WORTH BUYING,I DIDN'T EVEN BUY IT I HEARD IT FROM A FRIEND.THIS ALBUM IS NOTHING BUT JUNK."
5,Excellent book,"Inflation Targeting is a kind of monetary policy first exercised in New Zealand, in practice, and afterwards brought to the academy research. This book analyses the way that this and many other countries dealed with the new approach of conducting monetary policy towards inflation control, bringing a full and comprehensive description of the behaving of their economies as well as their main macroeconomic variables, before, during and after the targets have been set. It is extremely well written, making its reading very pleasant, and provides the reader a full description of the inflation targeting implementation."
4,Lens block flash on DSC-w1,"These lens work and include the adapter necessary for use with a dsc-w1. However, the size of the lens blocks the flash and casts a shadow on indoor shots."
2,its for video camera,"In the description , and title it says Sony Cybershot , so i thought its for digital camera , bought it, received it ontime, try it on my camera, doesnt fit, its for video cameras only. they should mention it on description and title.lost 60 dollors including shipping charges, and they given only 14 days for return for even international shipping. shipping charges 29 euro from ireland to usa. and even they don't pay return charges or even exchange.totally waste.poor service"
2,The lense created a dark border around the pics.,The clarity of the lenses was good but it didn't fit the camera like it was supposed to. It left a shadow like border to every pic.
4,Unit works great - charger bad,"After an exhaustive search I found this item over a year ago. While it works very well, I am unhappy with the charger for the battery. After less than two years of use ( batteries charged once per week) the charger stopped working. Too late for warranty, so I guess I have to find a charger."
3,Review #1 is a prank,"Due to the ridiculousness of this item, an inebriated acquaintance wrote the above review. Later, realizing that it may be an actual item, I decided to correct this error, but could not figure out how to undo the review. Sorry, and I hope the error is corrected as soon as possible."
4,A great read and interesting world,This book made me want to move to Alaska and look for portals into another realm. The world building was excellent and the tension between the characters was palpable.
5,Great information,You want un biased honest information regarding these religions that bug you at home on Saturdays..check this DVD out it is filled with honest info...then you make your own decision.....great DVD full of information....
1,THIS FILM IS trash!!!,"Having friends that are JWs and actually going to their church, I can tell you that this film is TRASH. The only way to find out the truth about something is going to the source and finding out for yourself. I have done my own investigation about JWs. Obviously the people who made this film are 'JW haters' that don't KNOW ANYTHING. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY.... Instead get some Britney Spears CD's!"
3,Sumo Life,"This book is there mainly to show westerners what sumo is really about. It goes through the rules and rankings of sumo wrestling and how the competition actually work. It has insights into sumo wrestlers lifes how they live, train and eat. The book helps to show what sumo is all about."
1,These are NOT the 1950s recordings! Listen before you buy.,"If you are expecting to hear the same recordings you heard as a teenager in the 1950s, this is not the CD you want."
3,Misleading cover,"The cover on this MCA disc says ""Eddie's first CD"". Perhaps for them it was, but it contains remakes of some of Eddie's early hits at a later time in his career. This is not necessarily a bad thing. Here he feels free to give more of an interpretation of the songs which I enjoyed. His voice is somwhat deeper but he can still belt out the high notes and at times he does his (in)famous Jolson ""imitation"". What I missed most was the Hugo Winterhalter Orchestral accompanyments. The unnamed orchestra on this CD is adequate, but nowhere near the great arrangements of the original--especially on ""Wish You were Here"". If you can pick up a used copy of this CD as I did for the songs I did not have in my collection, you get your money's worth. Otherwise stick to the original versions of the hits which are available from RCA and Taragon. They really show why Eddie Fisher was the most popular male singer of the early 1950's."
1,Shinsonic DVD player model DVD-3838,"Piece of junk. Very unreliable, poorly designed and cheaply slapped together. DVDs will either stutter and skip or, after a while, the player will not read any disks at all. Total rip off. Garbage like this should not be allowed on the market."
2,Fix for Shinsonic DVD-100 loading problem,"We found a shinsonic DVD-100 that our neighbors had gotten rid of and kept it. At first we had trouble getting the loading tray to open and close. We had to push against the tray just as the it tried to open and then quickly release. Eventually that too failed. I opened up the case and found the problem. It was a simple fix. The dvd player has to disengage a drive spindle before it can push out the tray. The top of the plastic dvd housing contains a bearing for the drive spindle. However, the plastic is too flimsy. When the open/close button is pressed, the drive spindle pulls down, but the top of the housing simply flexes downward, rather than releasing so the tray can open. I (a fairly home improvement-impaired person) screwed a brace across the the top of the plastic to make it stiffer. That solved the problem."
2,whatshappening?,"this short film is silent as the editorial review says--BUT i think the average viewer would expect some voice-over or even subtitles to inform you as to whats going on. this is NOT the case- it's totally viewer-unfriendly.do not buy this if you are expecting anything moore than a dvd-ized copy of undoctored silent raw footage without any titles or subtitles. the impression i got from the product information was that this would be footage of helen keller's visit to tokyo and yokohama, BUT it only covers her visit to tokyo."
3,Lack some details,The book was informative but was not clear on some of the detailed instructions.I found it to be acceptable .
3,Needs to be updated,The content and information of this subject are excellent and it is well written. It would be so much better if they revised it with modern photos or at least illustrations. I would recommend something more recent instead of this book.
3,Got this book to help me in building my barn,Got this book to help me in building my barn but decided after attending a barn building seminar several times to have the barn builder build it for me. Wasn't too impressed with the layouts and directions.
1,"Keep a copy handy in your ""out building""!","This is undoubtedly the worst written, worst illustrated book I have purchased from Amazon.I think the other reviews were from the authors family members. Luckily I purchased used asI do all publication from Amazon. This copy will be placed in the ""out house"" by my barn foremergency use. Save your money."
5,Simply Marvelous.,"An in depth analysis of both the man and his work. Not for the casual curious (read God's Outlaw instead), but unparalleled if you want meaningful insight into how the English language Bible came to be and the faithfulness, character and intellect of those who made it happen. Tyndale is as important a figure in that journey as anyone since Paul and John."
5,William Tyndale Biography,It was in excellent condition. It was an exceptional gift for my spouse which was extreamly excited about getting it.
4,A marvelous biography of worthy William Tyndale...,I have studied Tyndale's life and work for many years. This is clearly the best and most complete biography on Tyndale written in the last fifty years. It is a must read for serious students of church or Bible history. The only flaw (minor) -- numerous spelling errors in the first edition. A splendid accomplishment. The Church of Christ needs to know much more about this mighty giant of the faith than is commonly apprehended. I rate it 4 and a half stars!
3,Maybe it's the subject...,"But this book is really 'dry' to read. Plus, I expected a greater emphasis on computing and the internet, which are fertile areas for this subject. Nevertheless, there's some common sense information that might appeal to some law afficcionado."
4,Great Ending,"This is Slapstick's last concert ever played, even after they broke up. All of your favorite songs live. This is a must for any Slpastick Fan, good ska, and even a short skankin' contest! I gave this movie 4 stars because it's great when you get it, and after you watch it 4 billion times, it really gets old. But still is a good movie. If you get it, order it at Asian Man Records online, because there you will get it cheaper, and it will always be in stock.Check out my other reviews for cd's and movies!"
3,Interesting Story,"Not the most exciting or thrilling read, but it has some important and interesting information about the Mexican American culture."
4,Susan Mallery book the Sassy One,Book was in good conditon and arrived on time well packed from supplier. Wouldn't hesitate to buy from them again. The book matched the description that the supplier had quoted and would have no problems getting future books from them. Thanks keep up the good job! Happen to be a Susan Mallery fan so helped finding the book I wanted.
3,Another fun family,Susan's strength lies in the families she creates and follows through a series of books. This one also lets you dream about wine and pasta.
4,Witty repartee is the hallmark of this episode.,"""I've come to appeal to you,"" a straight-faced Emma says to Cartney, whom she is investigating. You certainly do, he tells her approvingly. For charity, Diana Rigg's dead pan makes it all the funnier. That the evil villain succombs to the same fate he assigned a member who had objected to his murderous methods is a neat plot twist. This one is fun but the funniest one is Honey for the prince."
3,A slow down from last year?,"With the release of 1984's ""My Kind Of Country,"" Reba McEntire catapulted herself into the reigning ""queen of country"" title. This album, however, makes one think that she cut this just to release new material. There isn't a strong cut on this album, except for the closing song ""Don't Forget Your Way Home."" Although I am a avid Reba fan, and I do like this album, I think only true Reba fans will buy this."
4,"If you want variety, buy this!","There is so much variety on this one! I'm in Love All Over and I Don't Need Nothin' You Ain't Got are two great upbeat traditional country songs. She's Single Again and Have I Got A Deal For You are 2 great Traditional songs. The Great Divide is a wonderful ballad. Her self-penned hit ""Only in My Mind"" was amazing!! Up and to this point Reba's self-penned songs never made it anywhere, but this one did. If I'm remembering correctly it made the Top 10. I agree with the others however. Red Roses and Don't Forget... are the 2 worst songs, and the 2 I normally skip over. Don't make that not buy it though. It's a great album anyway. It was Reba's 1st album co-produced with Jimmy Bowen, who helped her career immensely. Although this sparked no #1 hits, all of her albums from 1986-1989 gave 2 each."
5,WHY CAN'T SHE DO ANOTHER ALBUM LIKE THIS??,"When I sit back and listen to this ""work of art"" I ask myself, why can't Reba come back and do something else like this? The songs on her other albums like her more recent ones could have been done like this instead of using all that electric guitar and loud drums, etc. The music on ""Have I Got a Deal For You"" is the kind of country music I like to listen to and its time for Reba to return to the kind of music she made me fall in love with in the first place."
3,Not bad,"The acting was great, as to be expected. It truly is a great role for Gosling. I had some issues with the plot and the ending was anti-climactic."
3,The Ides of March,Good movie with a great cast. I thought it ended kind of abruptly i wished it went a little longer. Ryan Goslin and George Clooney.
3,this would be a great HBO series,The movie is decent however for the subject matter it felt flat to me. It lacked grand scope or that anything really mattered. I mean this was a presidential election but it felt like a local mayoral campaign.I acting and camera movements all were very well done. it had a great look and tone.This would have been great for a 12 episode miniseries on HBO. That way we could get more indepth exploration on each character and the cunning plans they have.
2,Cinematic Déjà Vu,"""The Ides of March"" emerges as a bloodless, overly familiar political drama that pales next to the 2012 presidential circus. Despite his strong supporting role, George Clooney stumbles in the directing and co-writing departments - placing faith on lackluster source material (Beau Willimon's 2008 play ""Farragut North""). An impressive ensemble cast is woefully underutilized. The 101-minute running time helps, but you've seen it all before and done much better."
2,Ides Of March,"Thought the movie was going to be good, but the movie was slow and dark. The only things I really liked about it were the chess game played by Giamatti's character and the reporting of Tomei."
4,Worth seeing once!,It was a slow movie in the beginning but once it picked up it was worth the wait. Great political movie with an amazing cast of people.
2,"great, thanks",all this talent and the best they can do is manage to give us a story pointing out that politicians and the subhumans who inhabit politics suck. ending should have worked in the opposite direction if they wanted to embrace the title. haven't been this disappointed in a movie in a long time.
1,A nothing. And a small nothing at that.,"Not one good thing to say about this movie. Absolutely tired, totally predictable plot, acting. Nothing new revealed about politics or those in that world. Sad, really sad that this is the best George can do, either directing or actinb. Not recommended at all."
3,*** I am hot for Ryan Gosling ***,"And I also really like Paul Giamatti.Gosling plays a junior campaign staffer for Governor Mike Morris, played by George Clooney. And Giamatti plays an experienced campaign staffer for the rival candidate. Naive Gosling learns about political corruption. I find his versatility in the roles he plays make him well worth watching.George Clooney and Phillip Seymour Hoffman are also excellent in their roles, especially Hoffman.The story is good, the politics are interesting. This movie keeps you on the edge of your seat.Co-editors of ""First Year University: A Survival Guide"""
2,Clooney's soapbox,"George finally gets a platform to play the principled politician, uncorruptable and endlessly wise, who says and does all the politically correct things (""Oh why can't all politicians be this sensible?""), and when he doesn't the assembled cast (including the usual liberal media suspects like Charlie Rose and Chris Matthews) fills in offering the leftwing line as fact. I guess this is more of a 'heads up', because if you don't happen to be of George Clooney's political persuasion - 'Rich White Man's Guilt'- you will be apt to shut it off after the first few howlers. I'm sure if you are in that 30% who admit to being progressive you will probably love this film, but if you are among the other 70% you are warned."
1,Don't pay money for this dud,"Disappointing and predictable. Don't waste your money on this. If you must watch it, borrow it from someone or check it out of the library. It actually had the makings of a really good movie, but it falls short on just about every level, and the ending is just stupid. Gosling is okay. Clooney is one dimensional (same vocal inflections and facial expressions he uses in every other movie he's ever been in). Giamatti and Hoffman are good. Marisa Tomei is so-so and not in the movie enough to really matter. The cast was really the only thing the movie had going for it from the beginning, but even all those big names were not enough to save this bomb. Too bad."
2,Yawn...,"While not completely horrible, TIoM was slow and not particularly engaging. Summary: young idealist becomes painfully disillusioned by the realities of politics. Not exactly an original theme there. Also, I thought the ending was abrupt and unsatisfying.Not recommended."
3,Just ok,"Movie was just ok, i will keep my review to the point worth a rent not a buy...Great acting just a ok storyline."
4,Ryan Gosling's breakout performance; stellar cast,"Excellent movie that delves into the backstage intrigues and deal-making during a campaign. It had a perfect combination of talented actors performing at their best, creating cynical tension without panic - Ryan Gosling, Paul Giamatti, Philip Seymour Hoffman. Ryan Gosling gave a particularly stellar performance and shows us he has come of age as a serious, dramatic actor. George Clooney again showed his talent as a director. The pace of this movie was exceptional, moving through steadily without feeling rushed. Cinematography was well-done, adding to the intimacy and drama. Highly recommended."
4,Unexpectedly good,"I thought the political/campaign movie genre had been fully explored, but ""Ides of March"" was a great surprise. Novel, well-written, and beautifully acted, with an ending I never saw coming. Well done! Two thumbs up."
4,The Ides of March,"Now that awards season is fully under way, 2011 is shaping up to be a pretty good year for George Clooney. He's already picked up a couple of awards for his work in The Descendants, but his latest directorial effort, The Ides of March, was nominated for four Golden Globes, including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Screenplay. The star-studded cast includes Ryan Gosling as an idealistic campaign manager who becomes increasingly jaded by politics, Philip Seymour Hoffman as his wily boss, Paul Giamatti as a competitor trying to woo Gosling away from his candidate, Marisa Tomei as a persistent reporter hungry for a scoop, and, of course, Clooney himself as the seemingly perfect presidential candidate who has a few secrets of his own. With talent like that and a timely story, the film was almost destined to do well, and it indeed is pretty good. Even if you're not so much into politics, it's still an expertly acted, smartly written drama."
2,Nothing New.,"I honestly think anyone could have written this movie. It brings nothing new to a political thriller. I wouldn't even recommend watching, is exactly what happens in most ""scandals"" of our day. It is like an episode of any political show (The West Wing) out there but one episode is in a movie. The West Wing did a lot better job of it though. I do like George Clooney and Ryan Gosling in it, but the storyline is not creative at all. I think if people liked this movie...they have never watched anything before on politics."
1,What a dud.,"Save your time and money. This is a terrible movie! We all know politicians are corrupt. It is like making a move about a cop who writes tickets and arrests people. Nothing original, no drama, no imagination, nothing worth watching!"
1,Yawwwn,"If you have to see this, I would strongly suggest you wait until it rents for $1.99. This has all been done before."
1,movie review,"Don't bother wasting your money..What a HUGE disappointment! This was simply boring, and nothing but a BIG political statement ...we watch our movies for entertainment, not for political opinions and leanings of writers and actors...We bought it and threw it in the trash...! When I want to find out how to vote, I do my research on both parties and look up voting records."
1,Political Talking Points,"The title for this movie should have been ""Left Wing Talking Points"". The story is intermingled with Clooney reciting political rhetoric. The basic story is interesting and Ryan Gosling is very good. Clooney could have phoned in his part. Liberal Hollywood should stop making propaganda movies for themselves."
4,A little movie with a great cast,"A little movie with a great cast. The sort of serious, small film that used to get made in between the big audience-pleasers in the studio days. Its nice to see such an impressive lineup of actors getting together for a project like this."
2,Interesting BUT not worth the Price,Starts off slow but eventually after 45 minutes speeds up with an interesting twist. This movie is not worth seeing for $3.99. Wait until its a $1.99 or better yet free.
1,something's missing,"the acting is good but if you want those actors serving an actual story instead of their own talents then look elsewhere. there is just something missing here, and i don't know what it is. i kept thinking i missed something or that there would be some extra twist or something but nothing ever happened. just not worth your time or money. not sure how this got 85% on rotten tomatoes - i guess the critics were won over by the acting because it wasn't the story."
3,Unscrupulous and Heavy-handed,"Unscrupulous and heavy-handed. I'm referring to the movie itself, and not to the movie characters.In his recent reincarnation as political messiah, George Clooney has an annoying habit of making political films (""Good Night, and Good Luck,"" ""Syriana,"" ""Michael Clayton"") that are aim at provoking our sense of fairness and angering our sense of decency, but which ultimately just make us angry and frustrated at having wasted two hours of our lives. The same goes for ""The Ides of March,"" about a ""best media mind of our times"" political strategist caught in a whirlwind of political idealism and office politics. It's a slow and unbelievable movie with dubious and unbelievable characters.Not making things better was how throughout the movie I was asking myself: Why is Ryan Gosling considered an A-list Hollywood actor?"
2,A non-deliver,"I'm giving this two stars because Gosling and Hoffman do their best to salvage a dismally directed political showcase. The message is weak a cautionary fade to black story that makes you wait for the onion but it never comes. Clooney--once again--is representative of the unrecoverable down turn that is Hollywood today, in that he is a type cast with propaganda to convey, and zero ability on either side of the camera."
1,The Ides of March,"I do believe that if Julius Caesar were able to see this piece of Gosling/Clooney tripe, he would have killed himself. What an incredible waste of time, money, effort, etc."
1,how bad can you get,"Wow what crap!!Some very good actors (Paul, Philip, Marisa) wasted on a terrible, disastrous screenplay. George Clooney needs to get over himself, he can't act and now he can't write. The producers must have a really low opinion of their audience's intellect or just lack intellect themselves. Gee I didn't know politics was dirty, no kidding, tell me more. Government/Politics is Satan's playground show it otherwise don't make a movie about gov/politics and educate yourself instead of learning from soundbites on your boob tube."
2,Boring - too much politics,"The story focuses on the last days prior to a heavily contested Ohio presidential primary. We're 'treated' to two scandals - one an affair between an intern and the candidate (George Clooney; she become pregnant, feels isolated - thanks to P.R. man Ryan Gosling (Stephen Meyers). The other involves Gosling meeting with the opponent's campaign manager over a possible job. (Turns out the job offer was just a ruse to get Gosling fired.)Bottom-Line: How can anyone not be sick of politics? It dominates the news most of the time. Adding 'The Ides of March' to an already crowded political environment is overkill. Boring."
3,3 for the actors,"This is a movie about the 'deals' made to get the needed votes and about loyalty and trust.... and How far are you willing to go to win or to protect the race?Chilling... superb acting... BUT .. It felt as if the story gave its all mid movie and then they were left spinning the wheel... It is not gripping until the end... It dies slowly and predictably...This could have been a fantastic movie worthy of awards if they researched the story a bit more maybe?OK to see, but this is not the usual level of GC like master pieces."
3,Joe average,"Pretty average film, despite the hype. Ending was a real anticlimax. Great actors, average writing, too one dimensional with it tailing off fast at the end."
2,the ides of march,"it wsa a slow moving movie, i kept waiting for it to get good.with the good actors in it , i was waiting for something to make it worth while to keep watching it."
2,The Ides of March,"A movie with lots of dialogue and predictable with the inevitable loss of innocence of the idealistic young campaign worker. But the cause of this rush of cynicism is tissue thin, the actions of a young, female campaign worker is so stereotyped as to be absurd. I thought that the writers would have been more complex but this is a simple morality tale that offers nothing new. Disappointed."
2,Every Liberal cliche all in one movie !,My title says it all. George Clooney is a progressive Liberal and every ludacris stereotype of a Republican is housed in two hours of Democratic party talking points and insanity. If you have a choice don't waste your time.
1,Caveat Emptor - sony dvd does not work on all players,"I wish I could view this film. George Clooney is a favorite actor and I'd certainly like to see how Ryan Gosling teams with him. However, this dvd will not play on a dvd player that works with every other dvd I own."
3,"Wanted it to be great, didn't deliver","I wanted this to be a great movie. It has a great cast and I'm interested in the subject matter. But it just didn't deliver. It wasn't horrible, it was just okay. The character development was poor and the plot line really was not all that compelling."
4,A solid political drama,"This is a very well cast production, putting to good use the myriad big names that appear throughout the script. Gosling turns in an Oscar-worthy performance as an idealist who becomes corrupted by the seasoned tacticians around him. From the very first scene, the script moves at a brisk pace and it's one of those rare films that is genuinely unpredictable and will have you guessing until the end. If you're a fan of Primary Colors, The Contender or The Candidate, this film joins the same stable of insightful, tragic and tightly-plotted political dramas."
1,Not such a great Movie,"I expected a better movie so I was a little disappointed about this movie. The shinning light was Philip Seymour Hoffman, without him might not have watched the movie to the end. The sad thing is it could have been a GREAT movie...."
2,"Good story but,","This is an interesting story and I think it was well acted - especially by Ryan Gosling. However, it was really slow and a bit boring.I agree with another reviewer in that the $3.99 price is not worth it."
1,Boring,I have to say that this was the most boring but to truth movie i have seen. i do not doubt that it is that way in politics george clooney did a good job on telling us the dirty and crupted side of politics. he did a great job directing it. i just didn't like it because i don't like and don't understand politics. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you don't unless you like poltic movies.
1,Sorry men...,"Sorry men... I didn't liked it. Politics has nasty sides? I'm not surprised, are you?I do not see anything new in this story. The actors playing in this movie are good/very-good but this is also something I knew too."
2,"Way, way underwhelming","I was waiting for this movie for a very long time. I thought that because it had some great actors in it, that it would be a great movie itself. I was wrong. What was a promising movie turned into nothing more than an empty vessel for communicating a cynicism about politics. This is nothing new, nor was it done in a new way. So what one is left with in watching this movie is just a feeling of watching something old and tired. Its a shame because it could have been a contender."
2,Really Implausible,"Yes, it's a great cast, but I don't care which way you lean politically, this movie is burdened with a wildly implausible script. There is not a single scene, quite frankly, that feels like it could take place in anything resembling the real world. What it amounts to is probably the most over-praised movie of the last several years. Save your time and watch All The President's Men instead. Much more entertaining, and relatively true to the actual events..."
3,"Good cast wasted on a ""made for tv"" story","This movie had plenty of promise behind it. It had a great cast, it was about politics (which rowels everyone up), and it came at the right time. The political topics in the movie are current, but the bias is undeniable. This movie is so one sided, it's laughable. I realize that it's Hollywood and if you aren't an insane Left-wingist, you don't have a career, but come on!! I guess material like this makes George Clooney and every other screaming liberal in Hollywood that much easier to smirk at and say, ""See, I always knew you were insane..."".Bias or unbias aside, the acting was good, especially from Gosling, whom did a great job playing the uncomfortable stuck in the middle what do I do guy. It was interesting to see his character evolve from nieve to controlled. If it wouldn't have been for his character, this would have been a strait to DVD, heck maybe even a straight to Lifetime movie..."
4,Good movie!,Good political thriller. Interesting. Great performances. Jennifer Ehle is great in one scene.Good political thriller. Interesting. Great performances. Jennifer Ehle is great in one scene.Good political thriller. Interesting. Great performances. Jennifer Ehle is great in one scene.
1,How I Lost 2 Hours of my Life.,"Predictable, yet boring. A govenor from Arkansas running for President sleeps with an intern, but his political ethics won't let him be blackmailed. George Clooney, I mean the govenor goes on a diatribe about how the Evil Republicans cheat and swindle elections to get elected. (No mention of ACORN though). The begining of the movie was slow and tedious, then it picked up to a crawl, and not to be disappointed, the ending was a total failure. For real entertainment value watch something like Buck Rogers or Three's Company. I'll probably give this dvd to a homeless person or trade it for a VHS copy of the ""Perfect Storm"" at some yard sale this weekend."
1,More Crap from Hollywood,I watched this movie and what I heard is the liberal left wing stuff I hear from the Democrats and progressives. They keep saying how only Republicans fight dirty. What a bunch of crap. As usual the left accuses others of stuff they do all the time. The movie is boring and lacks anything that keeps you from wanting to turn it off.
1,Skip it,Save your money. May well be one of the worst films I've viewed. Could not wait for it to be over Painful.
3,It's okay. It didn't end as well as I thought it would/should.,It didn't end as well as I thought it would/should. I'm guessing they cut out a few scenes that might have sewn the plot together a little better.
5,Politics,An excellent and intriguing movie to watch;acting is superb.The actors playing are incredible and the plot is very interesting.
2,Mediocre,"Barely interesting enough to view in full. Had I not paid for it, I would have hit the stop button after 20-30 minutes."
3,I tried but kept falling asleep,"I tried to watch this movie 3 times and kept falling asleep. It was too slow moving in the beginning for me, I guess. Maybe at another time I will try it again."
1,More of the same crap from the original Zombie Diaries,Don't go by the misleading cover art. There are no epic scene of zombie butt kicking. This is just another crappy camcorder video and audio movie with little production value. If you really want to waste your life watching this go onto netflix and watch it. Don't pay decent money and only encourage these people to put out a part 3. The zombie shorts on Lost Zombies have better production value and better writing.
1,Worst movie,"I watched this movie, and I'm even ashamed to say it. This is probably the worst movie made, and is so bad that it will become a classic bad movie. Bad directing, bad acting, bad special effects, bad dialogue and a terrible script all combine to form a classic debacle. It's so bad, that most movie critics shouldn't even pan this movie, since it gets a unique niche in bad movies."
3,Interesting but Just not Perfect,"I enjoyed the movie, but something just felt...I am not sure..maybe unfair to mathc up against other britsh zombie film Shaun of the Dead? If a zombie fan make it part of your collection, but try to find it at a cheaper rate (maybe in the $5 Walmart/Target bin full of other DVD and blue rays)."
1,Don't waste your time......,"Ive rented ALOT of Zombie movies, this one stinks!!!! I liked the first one ALOT, I can't even finish this one, my opinion, super boring, sorry."
4,"Finally, BRITS with Firepower","This is a very good zombie flick. With a few changes, it could have been my favorite of all. Its still as good or better than everything except the Dawn of the Dead (both versions)."
3,Outed>,"Well, I've had one foot in the closet and the other one on a banana peel about this issue so here goes...I actually like RFTW! Yes it's true. Even though it's watered down Prince, I managed to find some redeeming qualities anyway. Although now the music seems almost campy, over the years it has provided some cool memories so what the hay.Some of my favorites are: ""Tonight""/""Digital Display""/""Deep Inside Your Love""/""Oh Sheila""/""Out Of Town Lover""/""I'm The One Who Loves You."""
2,Does not hold up,"""Oh Sheila"" still pumps me up for the dance floor, but I can't pay too close attention. The rest of the album is... spotty, at best. OK SO I BOUGHT THE WHOLE ALBUM WITHOUT LISTENING TO ANY SAMPLES JUST BECAUSE I LIKED ONE SONG AND FIGURED THE REST WOULD BE AS AWESOME DAMNIT"
4,Ready For This,"Ready For The World's self-titled debut album is a treasure trove of mid-80's r&b classics. Even though the band is from Michigan, they mine the fertile Minneapolis sound of the era to great effect. Oh Sheila"" is the most well known becoming the band's one and only number one single on the pop charts. The song is a rightful 80's classic with its snappy beat and catchy chorus. ""Digital Display"" has a heavy synth sound. ""Tonight"" is a ballad with a pop edge while ""Deep Inside Your Love"" is a straight power r&b ballad. ""Slide Over"" is a slow burner and ""Ceramic Girl"" is an up-tempo number with a kicking bass. Ready For The World experienced success after this album, but they were never better than here."
2,Not Authentic Microfiber,"This is definitely NOT authentic microfiber. Before even reading the label I could tell it was made in China. If you want the real stuff, buy something made in the USA. I recommend the Sonus brand from Autopia(dot)org."
5,speaks to your heart,I enjoy listening to this album. It helps me fall asleep at night even when my mind is running in several dirrections. I feel peace of God come over me. Jimmy's music is always good and very annointed.
1,Somewhere in Time (Collector's Edition),It's a limited screen view version with wide all around black frame even though it stateda widescreen version . Returnedfor refund
3,Romantic But Incomplete,"This movie has lots of promise, but fails to engage the viewer in how the two are able to come to such a timeless love in such a very short time."
2,Hated the film's silly method for time-travel,The idea of time-travel via self hypnosis (or just simply 'willing' one's self to do it) is WAY too silly for my taste and it more or less ruined the movie for me.Don't you think there would be people time-travelling all the time if it was that easy?
3,Somewhere in time,"Christopher Reeve and Jane Seymore did a great job with what they had. I enjoyed it, but at times found myself wondering. Remember that this was filmed in the 1980's. Techniques we have grown used to, weren't around back then ... so prepare yourself. In general it's a fun movie at a great price. Enjoy!"
3,Not bad but not brillant!,2 Exceptional actors in a non exceptional story. Entertaining but a Saturday afternoon movie not Saturday night!A man falls in love with the image of a woman from before his time. He finds out how to travel in time to go back to her.He succeeds and then dosent. But love crossses all boundaries and see how he wins again.
3,Martyr's bones,"The University of Cambridge is in a state of near warfare with the townspeople and the staff and students of the colleges, coming to actual blows and riots occurring regularly. Physician and teacher, Matthew Bartholomew and his friend, Friar Michael, are convinced that the anarchy is being deliberately caused for someone's advantage and, after the discovery of a body in a nearby ditch, which is declared to be the bones of a saint, determine to discover the real reason behind all the trouble. It's an involved plot with dozens of characters..in fact, there are too many characters for my liking, and it becomes a real effort to keep up with them. More murders occur and more of the main players disappear before all is revealed in the final chapter. I don't think that I'll bother with any more of this series as it's too much like hard work and not enough about the pure enjoyment of a good story."
1,Who is Ellis Amburn anyway?,"Other than through the name of Elizabeth Taylor, I have never heard of Ellis Amburn and I hope never too again. Was he an early version of David Bret or Darwin Porter? Avoid this book at all costs. There really is no need to point out all the inaccuracies here. According to Amburn, everyone Taylor knew was gay (gee just like David Bret's book on Taylor). Do we have to go through all that again?"
1,Digital Timer is Buggy,"I agree with an earlier post about the Battery Back-up being buggy. I bought one in late-Dec (it's now March 1) and it seems to just ""lose"" it's program for no apparent reason. The first time was while I was on vacation and all of my corals were left in the dark for several days (with one fatality). It's happened 2 or 3 times since then. We've not had any power-outages AND I've replaced the batteries in the unit - just to play it safe. It still loses it's program arbitrarily. Kind of defeats the purpose of having an automatic light-timer!I've emailed the manufacturer - but no response :-(Now I'm looking for a manual/dial-type of timer that (hopefully) I can rely on! I think I'll stay away from Coralife though."
1,Skip it.,"The daylight-nightlight outlets were switched to start with. Then, I had a problem with a protein skimmer, and some water got onto the unit. Rather than tripping the surge, it started sparking and smoking. Fortunately, I was in the room, and was able to switch it off before a full on fire. Needless to say, the computer/timer functions are completely dead now. Skip this one."
1,JUNK,"Do not buy this timer. It's absolutely unreliable garbage. It loses its programs randomly and resets itself. It worked well for a month, but with the latest incident it was stuck in the ON position for an entire weekend leaving my tank exposed to light for 72hrs (Tank is in my office). My inverts were completely annoyed with 2 peppermint shrimp deaths (I imagine they starved because they are nocturnal feeders) and my anemone lifted off its rock to find a shadier location in the tank. Skip this timer and just use some powerstrips and old school dial light timers. Check out the reviews for this product over at marinedepot too. They're very similar!"
1,What a piece of junk,"I ordered this for my new saltwater aquarium last week. It arrived a few days later. I was excited to test it out, so I opened it up and popped the battery cover off to remove the plastic protector so I could program the timers. After pressing ONE button, the LCD on the front of the thing stopped working. ONE BUTTON. I have replaced the battery and done everything that was said in the instruction booklet. Basically I have an expensive 6 outlet surge protector now (since I cannot program the yellow slots to work, the night slots work all the time). I would DEFINITELY not advise you to buy this. Look online at saltwater forums (like I should have done) and see the countless stories just like mine. It sucks. Dont buy it."
2,Basic overpriced power strip,"Ordered for my aqua accessories, hoping it would take care of turning on/off lights and pumps at specified times.Although this is better that basic analog timers in term of use, the battery function ruins this device. Battery is small (watch type), located on the back of the strip (so you need to dismount the strip from the wall to change one). Included battery came dead. The internal clock operates off the battery, if the main switch is turned off. Programming is easy, but doesn't work until a day after.I bought a simple power strip instead with a basic timer (separate) from Home Depot, that works perfectly for under $20."
1,Plainly doesn't work,I was optimistic about it even though I saw poor reviews and I bought it and it doesn't work in the slightest. All the ports are always on and never turn off. JUNK
2,fault internal clock,I ordered this product set the time and my program schedule plugged it in and waited. While waiting the 2 hours before my lights were to turn I noticed the clock mins are changing every 29 secs ( I timed them) so in a matter of a day it ran 3 days ahead of the actual day. I ordered a replacement so we'll see if it happens with the next. I'm pissed off!!!! Royally pissed.
4,Needs more options,I like this power center alot. My only qualms is the fact it needs more options for cycling on and off. I have opposing powerheads in my tank and it would be nice if i could have them switch back and forth during the day. Needless to say I needed another to control this. That being said it works flawlessly and is very easy to use and set.
1,do not waste your money,Clock always resets itself...baught this for my reef tank..sounded like a good idea... but have not been able to use it at all other then the 4 constant outlets...have not been able to get the timed ones to work i have re programed 4 times before giving up....dont waste your money ..
4,Nice Timer for the Price...,"Admittedly, this product has not received the best reviews. However, my digital timer has worked surprisingly well for me. I have had it on my marine tank the past couple of years with no apparent problems. At first I had some issues setting the correct modes, etc. But, I re-read the instructions, you have to read them VERY CAREFULLY and you should be able to set it without issue. I am pleased with the timer outlet for the price. I picked mine up at a local fish store. I had the analog power center before and did not care for it whatsoever. Based on some of the other reviews I have read, perhaps I got lucky with mine and got a GOOD one. Happy Marine Fish Keeping!"
5,The beauty of mathematics revealed thru sculpture,A reality check for those of us who were brought up to think that mathematics is dry and esoteric.
2,celebrating florida,"I find that it is no more than a catalogue of a private collector's paintings with no idea or history of the art, why it was created, and what it may mean in the realm of art. It is a good collection, but not on view for the public. It is more of a personal vanity press item."
4,extensive compilation,"Having always loved Peter, Paul and Mary since childhood, I realized I wanted one of their classic CDs to play in the car and when friends visit. In retrospect, I wish I'd bought a simple CD containing their overall top hits. This CD is for someone who wants a mini-library, and for that, it should get a rating of five stars. It's wonderfully comprehensive and there's even a fine book included.Because my nostalgia is for their more non-overt political songs (""Leaving On a Jet Plane""), these four CDs are too much. Although I'd have appreciated owning this compendium of material, I wish there was one CD, among the four, containing just ten or twelve of their most popular songs (from the late 60's) -- one for be-bopping down the highway and singing with the kids and the other for ""serious"" listening."
5,Remember,"This is an absolutely great CD. it has most of the songs that PP&M; have ever sung. It will take days to listen to all of them. Share them with your kids, cry and laugh as you relive those moments in time that we all shared in trying to make the world a better place. Everyone should take the time to revisit the past and enjoy the songs that make you feel good.Loved it!!!"
1,YAWN,"Dragged on and on. The small print and tedious dribble made me sleepy. Try: Scream at the Sky, Salt of the Earth,or An Hour to Kill."
1,Couldn't finish reading the book,"As a fan of true crime I have read alot. Some good some not so good however, I was always able to finish the book. Not so with ""A Killer Among Us"". It started out ok but then it just went on and on, and over and over we were reminded of how wonderful Elizabeth was and how close her family was. I can only wonder why, if there were so much suspicion about Rick killing her would she stay in that house? If I was that suspicious of my husband I would have left that house so fast there would have been skid marks. And how one woman let alone two, found the boring eel faced Rick attractive is beyond me. Don't waste your time with this one."
5,"A truly emotional book about my cousin, Elizabeth DeCaro.","It's a heartbreaking true story about my cousin Elizabeth. It's hard to imagine that she went through all this turmoil even to her death. My heart reaches out to my family: My Aunt, my Uncle and all my cousins for their courage and strength to write this book and especially Melanie. Elizabeth is now with our Father where she is at peace. May her love continue to shine in her children, her brothers and her sisters, for she will never be forgotten."
4,Great movie for Joe Lando fans!,"""Any Place But Home"" shows us again how great Joe Lando is at revealing his caring and loving self to the audience. He is compassionate all through the movie and it makes you want to cry with him for the horrors he goes through."
1,ABSENT VIDEO!,"I have not yet watched this video - because I sent it back to you by mistake! (I did not recognise the sender's name - I did not know that the package had come from Amazon)). So please will you return the package to me - I will pay any additional costs involved - Sorry for any inconvenience, thank you very much, Jennifer P.Hallam."
1,Not the funny Swear Bear--don't get it.,"I bought this as a gag gift for a friend. Someone had gotten a similar one at a 50th birthday party that was hilarious--quiet and subtle. There is nothing subtle, quiet or funny about this one. Enough said."
3,Cute little Bear,I thought it would be a Larger Bear. It is small about 6 or 8 inches.Volume is a little low on the speaker and i don't think it can be adjusted.It was a gag gift for a Birthday.It did the trick.I would recommend it.Wish it was a little larger and the volume was a little louder.
1,mechanical,"This may be an ""interesting project"", but we don't have much music here. Try listening to a Scarlatti sonata performed live by a good pianist behind a good piano. Then anything in this set will just sound like an amplified telephone beeper."
5,All in one box set,I have been looking for these albums for a long time but never wanted to purchase them individually because of the cost. This is the perfect box set and the included book really gives insight in to the difficulty Wendy had and the hard work she put in to these albums. Recommeded!
4,Technically impresssive but sterile,"I bought this after being a fan of the original recordings when they came out. I was surprised by how my tastes had changed over the years. I now find synthesized classical music to be sterile and lacking in humanity. The sound is mechanical rather than warm. Carlos is a genius as far as technique goes but I now prefer my Bach played on non-electronic imstruments. Looking back, these were amazing experiments but something of a dead end."
5,Great Hawaiian Music,Alfred Apaka has always been my favorite Hawaiian artist. He has a great voice and sings the songs so well it makes you feel like you are in Hawaii.
2,Asian girl doll,"This doll had horrible hair. It had ugly, uneven long layers and when I tried to put it in a ponytail part of the head looked bald because the hair rows were spaced too far apart. I ended up trimming the long layers off to make the baby look like it had a shoulder length bob cut. The facial expression wasn't the greatest either. Unfortunately, it's one of the better Asian dolls out there, so I had to take it."
2,Only for incredibly patient people,"I have to wonder, when this DVD was produced, if any normal people tested it before distribution? I have been doing step aerobics for years and I have given up on this DVD. It makes me angry as I struggle to understand the complex moves and it makes me completely furious every time the camera focuses on Patrick's face and not his feet. What idiot producer thought that would be a good idea? Perhaps if my DVD player had a 'slow' function I would be able to figure out the choreography, but I'm too angry now with this horrible production to care anymore."
4,Another Great Effort,"Ann Hampton Callaway has managed to issue another great recording blending an old time cabaret sound, classic songs, jazz background, modern recording quality and her stellar talent and voice. She seems to bounce her way through the lyrics and impart the jubilation, pensiveness or whatever other emotion is called for by the text.I like some of her other recordings better but there is nothing about this one which is unlikable. It is, in a word, GREAT!""Skylark"" in particular deserves to be singled out for praise. She was singing MY song."
2,This is a great new discovery for me...........,"This is be a first for me, buying a cd by A.H.C. I must report that I haven't been disappointed with this jazz singer. Ann really has the voice and style to sound perfect for this venue. I can see now why see has so many fans, she really entertains her listener.The only dark spots I find about this cd is these few things. For one, I thought the song selection could have been a little better and two, I didn't like some of her tracks where she scatted. I thought her band gave a good performance.I will plan to buy more of Anns' product in the near future."
2,Want to move on ..,"This is book is okay for someone wishing to understand the protocols and the building blocks that make up the protocol stack. But its emphasis on the applications is very, very poor.I personally think that the numerous companies now have invested money in the building blocks and now want to benefit from developing applications, which can be sold to their customers.This book does not add anything new for me."
1,Bad! or best?? textbook to understand or teach Bluetooth,"In Hands-free profile explanation, there are some drawings from Fig. 20-8 to Fig. 20-12. In these drawings, the pictures of Hands-free device and Audio Gateway are all opposite.In real Hands-free profile, an Audio Gate-way is a cellular phone and a Hands-free device is a ECU which has audio I/F.In these, the pictures of the cellular phone are all right side left, mirror image. I think this might be a kind of mistake on making books, but it is a bad joke or an evidence of carelessness of the authors that they could not find these in their proofreading phase.If there were same kind of mistakes in the other parts, a reader would need to read all related specifications and check them. It might make a reader to be a real expert of Bluetooth, but who want to buy and read this book with referencing the all specification in the same time?"
4,Yamaha PSRD1,I am looking for a instuction booklet on the PSR-D1. Can anybody help with that.916 536-1926. Also I am missing three knobs.Please call Barbra if anybody can tell me where I can purchase these items.ThanksBarbra
4,It does work,My chiropractor recommended this book to me as I have lost some weight several moths ago and was getting sagging skin as a result. I had asked my chriropactor for some suggestions and this book was the suggestion. The steps are simple and so far it does seem really be working. I would recommed trying it out.
4,A good primer for most permanent residents,"As a lawyer, I am not a big fan of legal self-help books.This book in an exception to my general skepticism.Chock full of useful information like the time between application in interview in various locations this book can help the average permanent resident navigate the process on his or her own. It has an excellent discussion of when not to apply for citizenship, as a certain number of people will end up being deported as a result of their applications.Most people do not need lawyers once they have obtained a green card and apply for citizenship. They do need help however, and this book can help navigate an uneventful road to the swearing-in ceremony."
4,:0),So far so good very helpful read so far of what I have read I have many friends in this situation and it's good to know I can pass on some of this knowledge.
4,Helps you through the naturalization process,"This book helped a friend through her naturalization process. She found valuable information that helped her prepare all the required documents and forms to apply to become a US Citizen. It also answered some of the questions she had about the process.I recommend this book based on her recommendation. She did not hire an attorney and was able to get valuable information through this book and online.If you are applying to become a US Citizen, do check out some of the online forums that discuss the current process and wait times. The application process is the same but the wait times may be slightly different depending your location.But this book is a great reference and starting point that walks you through the process. One note of advice: Laws change so you should always check out the USCIS website to get the most updated information regarding application, exam and interview."
4,Growing up a boy,"Some things never change, like being a new kid in school and facing tough situations and falling in love. Although written 100 years ago Stephen Crane captures what it is to be a boy growing up in a small town. Much like Ray Bradbury in Dandelion Wine he brings back those warm and sometimes terrible episodes of boyhood. Aside from a few dated ethnic references his descriptions of life as viewed by a 12 year old holds true today. This was Crane's last work written serially to bring in money as he was dying. Amazing that he could recall so vividly his own boyhood experiences as he was Jimmy."
1,"um, did the sewing machine break?",ewwwwww.........these are not Prada quality...the little plastic label in the back says they are and even the zipper says Prada but look inside at the seam.......strings a plenty. Would not wear to even go to the grocery store for fear of them falling apart. Sending back and moving on.
1,Was not a fan of this tea.,"I drink tea every day, and I especially like the vanilla-flavored teas, but this one had a bitter taster, even with sugar and cream added. I would not recommend."
2,Serpa Holster,Good product but the company sent me the wrong holster. I asked for a Berreta 92 and received a SIG modle.
5,Great product works as advertised,"I own several fairly expensive acoustic guitars and thus need to keep each properly humidified (above 40%) particularly during the winter when home heating reduces humnidity levels. I have a couple of these as well as a few similar, although smaller, 'Dampit' products. These Martin products seem to last a couple of days longer than the competitor thus I check and replenish the humidifier about every nine days or so. No need to use them here in Texas other than the winter months. I recommend these."
2,Not Martin,"To my surprise the product I received was not from Martin. Tried it out and it seems to be working but I am skeptical to the quality and duration of whatever company's product this is. Definitely not from Martin, which is false advertising, which to me is a big disappointment."
2,False advertising-Not a Martin product,I bought this also because it had the Martin name so I thought it was approved for their guitars. However as the others have mentioned there is no mention of Martin or any of Martins logo's on any of the packaging only RDM Enterprises. This ad should be revised.
1,Save your money,Thinking of buying this Martin guitar humidifier ? Stick with Martin guitars only and look elsewhere for a humidifier.
1,Dreadful! Are the other reviewers reading a different book?,"I ordered this book as I had decide to learn how the small German states coalesced in such a relatively short period of time and thought a look at Bismark would be a good place to start. I have fallen in love with the odd entity that was the Holy Roman Empire and have a not insignifgant number of books on that subject so this would be a natural progression for me. So I had high hopes for this book. Sadly, the author of this book acts like Bismark cuckolded him and kicked his dog on the way out. The extravagent charachter assasination is over the top, certainly unnecessary and likely untrue. Reading this book is unpleasant in the extreme - I stopped reading approximately 50 pages in. Find another biography, as I am doing. If hagiography had an antonym, that word would best describe this book."
3,"Useful, but not Lawrence's best","This book gives lots of examples of 2 over 1 auctions and covers many of the options for handling different situations. As such it is good for tuning your bidding but less so as a first book for learning 2 over 1. I suppose that is fine, given that it is called a ""Workbook"". I find that it lacks the clear and careful explanations of the reasoning behind choices that is present in Lawrence's other books. That said, this is well worth it if you view it primarily as a workbook."
4,Not as perfect as I had hoped!,"After a great deal of research, I purchased this hooded robe to replace a Lands End HEAVY, long, now-tattered robe which my parents had purchased for me years ago. As they no longer carry this item, I went in search for the perfect replacement. While this robe is more than adequate and a great fit, it is not as heavy or as long as I had hoped. It is fairly warm, but not as cozy as I had hoped, so I do not live in it in the mornings as I would have liked..."
5,Now a classic work for the study of the Prophets.,"Bullock's Introduction has now become a classic work in the field of the biblical Prophets. It covers each book of the Old Testament prophets in a thorough and consistent mannor. The author provides a wealth of background material and addresses problematic questions or texts as they relate to each prophet. Outlines for each book are provided as well as a brief summary of the message and key theological points. The book is written from an evangelical perspective, certainly a strength, as it pays careful attention to the biblical text and the intent of the prophet. This is an excellent introduction and summary to the prophets and highly recommended for any who want to further their knowledge about the prophets and recent areas of discussion."
4,serious but less entertaining,"Spencer Pickett did an excellent job in explaining internal control. It's a broad introduction covering most aspects of the issue. The business novel style, successfully used by Blanchard, Goldratt, Landsberg etc. starts with a promising, crisp first chapter of 15 easily digestable pages. However, the remaining chapters are chunks of about 50 pages of nearly endless discussions of topics in the context of a dreadlock holiday. It's like half a bottle chilled high quality red wine in the morning. The high quality is in the examples and topics, the less digestable part is the story. On the other hand, without the story, it would be as dull as a Cobit or Basel2 manual.Fair introduction!"
4,Very Good General I/C Coverage,This book did an excellent job of covering the entire gamut of internal control from the enviroment to procedure writing. The chapter on concepts of control was particularly well written.This book definitely prepares you for the next step-writing an I/C policy for your business.
2,"Plodding, boring, predictable",I don't have time to wade through this.... Had to go buy something more suitable.
1,Disappointing and not focused!,I have taken up the book based on the reputation of Mr K.H. Spencer Pickett and was disappointed with the way the book was written.It feels like reading a textbook where everything is covered with little focus and superficial knowledge is imparted. The only thing that helps is the way the book is written using a story of a manager whose company is in trouble. This helps to reduce the boredom of wondering what the author is trying to tell us.Many theories are presented but the book lacks examples from real life situations and companies.
4,A Review With Corrections,"This is a 112 page comic book with perfect (or square) binding. It reprints two previously released Tandra graphic albums, ""Quest For The Iron Cloud"" and ""The Alpha Men"". This is not the standard comic book page layout with word balloons as both dialog and story prose are grouped below the illustrations. In fact, this is more an illustrated story than a standard issue comic book. The interior pages are black ink on white paper and the covers are full color paintings. The story is definitely intended for mature readers, though it is in no way pornographic. If it were a movie, it would possibly be rated PG. The drawings are detailed and professional and the story is somewhat akin to Star Wars or Star Trek. It is fast paced and entertaining. I should know because I created it. One more thing, this book is NOT out of print!"
1,Disappointing,"After putting up with separate DVD player and VCR taking up space in the entertainment center, we decided to replace them with this combo model. In all honesty, I wish I had stuck with the old machines.The VCR on the unit began having trouble playing tapes within just a few weeks of purchase. In well under 6 months, it was eating tapes outright. So after getting rid of my original machines because they took up too much space, I ended up with a really big DVD player (with a less-than-impressive picture.)I've since replaced this unit with a different brand. The new machine is much more reliable and has a clearer picture."
3,Works great for the cost,"I bought mine on sale for I think 75 dollars when they were running around 150. Mine works great. Sometimes it takes a few seconds to open the DVD player, but it always opens for me. I've never had my VCR eat a tape either. The great thing is that it plays MP3 songs too!<br /><br />Occasionally I will have a skip in a DVD or song, but I just take the disk out, put it back in, and everything is back to normal."
1,Stay Away from this one!,"It is now April 29, 2005! I purchased one for a Christmas gift in early Dec., but because my sister was out of town, she did not plug it in until Jan.; it wouldn't eject the 1st tape put in. Since it was over a month since I purchased it, Amazon said I would have to utilize the warranty process. I did, bringing it into a ""factory authorized"" repair store.It has been in there for 3, count 'em, three months, and the repair store says they still haven't received the necessary part...."
3,Decent product...,"I ordered two of these combo players, one for my main television and one for my bedroom. After one year, one is playing just fine. On the other one, the DVD player stopped working after about 9 months. It's on the main television, so who is to say that my 3 year old didn't destroy it? I'll never know.The picture quality is fine. While the DVD drawer is a bit on the flimsy side, it hasn't broken off. The process to go through to set the VCR to tape at a later time is quite cumbersome, however."
3,OK model,"The major problem I have had with this machine is that it has destroyed several of my VHS's. It does, however, play most DVD formats, except for those that have been created on a computer. I've had this VCR combo for bout a year and a half. I'm in the process of buying a replacement."
1,Extremely Disappointed,After I recieved in the first unit and set it up I began to have problems. Within 5 days of working with the new unit the DVD stopped reading any media put into it. I called and was told I would have to pay for the return RMA shipping. I refused and finally they paid for the return and sent out a new one. This one stopped working within 15 minutes of use. I will be returning this one as well and have asked for my money back! Turned out to be a very big waste of time.
3,Watch out!,I purchased a Toshiba VCR/DVD combo but the DVD door was stuck. Word of caution.... if you don't test your electronic purchase before the 30 day return period you're stuck with it. It happened to me and now I am stuck with a broken VCR/DVD and Amazon will not replace the item or refund my money. You're better off purchasing at a 'brick and mortar' store.
4,Tarantella,This is an excellent CD of lyrical bass music. The rendition of Rachmaninov's Vocalise in G minor and the Kreisler are particularly fine (although I would have perhaps taken the Vocalise a notch slower). The Tarantella of the final track is a superb dispay of musical virtuosity.
4,and meet on the ledge they do,"This is really a great find. The Full House lineup reunites, plus Rowlands (presumably on additional percussion~ Mattacks is on full power himself) in 1981. Amazing that these exact guys hadn't played together in ten years, and they haven't missed a beat; impossibly tight for a one-off performance. They're as intense on Poor Will & the Jolly Hangman & Matty Groves as they were on House Full from '70. Thompson & Swarbick have some fierce duets on the jigs (Brilliancy Melody/Cherokee Shuffle). Country Pie is fun, too, and it smokes musically. On top of all this, as another even rarer bonus, Judy Dyble (re-)joins the band to sing ""Both Sides Now,"" Fairport's very first single from 1967 (and, you guessed it, her voice sounds like a dove). The real deal here, these guys are just great, I guess."
3,Does not replace 754-0101A.,This belt does not properly replace OEM part number 754-0101A for an MTD single stage snow thrower.
2,Decade You Were Born-The 50's,"Not what I expected, at all. The majority of the disc contained ""corporation/military"" documentaries. The social, political, and cultural themes of the decade were just briefly glossed over. There were a few TV commercials and a public domaine film included. That being said, it was worth the $5.00 just to watch it."
5,And electronic day trader,"This is a very good broad book covering much of what I was looking for in Stock trading plus a lot about other products to trade for those, like me, wanting to expand.I would also recommend The Electronic Day Trader which adds to the day stock trading material in this book"
1,"a ""learn to invest for pre-schoolers""","I'm only sorry I didn't get around to returning this book within the 30 days required by Amazon. ""DO you know what a computer is?"" - if so skip chapter one. ""DO you know what the internet is?"" - if so skip the next 10 chapters. This book is NOT for serious investors. This book is for some retired person who knows absolutely nothing about computers and the internet and saw the add for Ameritrade on TV."
1,Nothing Useful Here for Traders,There are much better books currently available which really do provide profitable insights to traders unfortunately not this one!Check out Elders book.
1,"Inadequate,insufficient and Innept",The title doesn't deliver substance.This book offers zero to the trader.I would recommend avoiding this very insubstantial book.
5,Excellent depth and breadth,"I was really impressed with how much information is in this book - going from start to finish. It is a reference tool I keep on finding myself returning to.Each step of the trading process is detailed, from making sure your hardware and software are up to date, to getting the cheapest data, to performing analysis - fundamental and technical, to getting the best online information, to execution of trades and beyond."
2,Good overview of online trading but far too basic,"Nice overview of the online trading market in general. However, the book is VERY basic and the medium-knowledgable investor (as myself)and/or the person how has been trading online before will be disappointed..."
1,very underwhelming!,"If you're an old lady in an investing club, then this book might be for you...But For aggressive investors who wish to become active traders, Save Your Money, its better spent elsewhere, Nassar and Friedfertig's books are much better if you want to make a living at electronic trading."
1,A Total Beginner's Guide,"If you haven't purchased your computer yet, and only heard about the Internet in the news, and heard that your neighbor is making lots of money trading stocks on his computer, then you may consider buying this book. It is a total beginner's guide and should have had this in its title."
2,For the newbie,"This is a book for an absolute beginner who has no investing experience and no Internet surfing experience. The author tells you about PC hardware, how to select an ISP, how to surf and gives you a lot of website addresses. If you have more than 3 months experience surfing or investing, you'll find this book too elementary."
1,For the internet beginner,"If you need an introduction to the Internet and PC hardware and how to use a web browser search engine this is the book for you. If you want to know about online trading it is not. Even the information regarding online brokers was out of date and incomplete. As far as trading strategy which I was hoping for it had none, just some common sense advice, not much detail, a little bit of information on technical analysis, but again very basic. I do not recommend this book to anyone who already owns a pc and has an internet connection!!"
2,"May be OK for beginners, but lacking much needed detail","I was hoping that this book would cover tips and tricks for online day trading and describe strategies for knowing when and how to execute trades. I did not find this information anywhere in the book and I was disappointed to discover that much of the book described how to choose an ISP (if you are reading this, you are obviously already connected) and listed several web sites for doing stock analysis, many of which I already knew about. In fact, the only useful things I found in the entire book were a couple of sections in the appendix that described things like options and futures trading, but even these were very poor with their lack of detail."
2,Not all it's hyped up to be,"I bought this book based on other customer reviews, and frankly, this one belongs in the ""internet navigation"" section. A trading book, it is not. However, the pages devoted to the various websites were very informational. But, unless I missed something, this book was desperately lacking any market insight . THIS BOOK TOLD YOU WHERE TO LOOK, BUT NOT WHAT TO LOOK FOR !!"
3,Great Optics - Bad build design,"These binoculars are among the best optics for the price, unfortunately Audubon does not guarantee them. I have contacted the company many times and they don't respond.On the non-HP version, the lens straps were rubber and tore through almost immediately. The ocular falls off if you have to adjust the focus too often. And the most annoying problem encountered immediately was the collapsing eye cups. This was a problem when the bins were brand new. As soon as I bought these I ended up having to put rubber bands under the cups to hold the them open.It is a real shame because these really could be the best binoculars for birding and butterflying, but I can't afford to replace them every year or so."
5,Best sippy cup ever,"I have searched far and wide for a good sippy cup for my 10 month old. Most are too hard to get the liquid out of and I was forced to remove the valves (causing a mess). These are by far the best I've tried and I've tried them all. There is a valve that stops it from leaking but you wouldn't know it by how easy it is to get liquid out when drinking. This is the only sippy cup that worked for my daughter, I highly recommend it!"
1,plastic spout disintegrated,"At first, my 9-month old son drank out of this cup better than any other; however, after only a few weeks I saw that the plastic on the spout was disintegrating and getting around and in his mouth. I immediately threw the entire thing away and purchased a Born Free which we have been very happy with."
3,It Spilled,"My children really liked this sippy cup. I, however, was less than thrilled when it leaked all over my carryon on a trip. It also has a tendency to spill when I open it up to refill it.I don't plan on buying this again."
5,"brilliant, profound and moving","Rarely has a recording of medieval music combined such a serious scholarly approach with an extraordinary musical expressiveness. This work sets a completely new trend in interpretation of medieval music, which has so often been reduced only to a display of dry technical knowledge about so-called 'early music performance' devoid of all emotion. Simply a must."
5,An excellent book,"This is an excellent book in both quality illustration and clear writing. If you have an interest in where all the ropes (lines) went or there purpose, this will answer.This is an excellent book describing a bygone skill."
4,One of best book on rune magick,A great book for anyone whishing to learn more about the runes.and one of better one i had the pleasure to read
3,Looking for more,"Good book but a CD doesnt come with it, like it's suppose to. I mean on the back of the book, it says so. The book focuses on more of the Restaurant things and not front desk, but it's alright if you are into ALL the hotel industries."
1,The translation is WRONG,"The old style writing of ""s"" which looks like an ""f"" should be translated as ""s"" when printed with modern equipment. This book translates them to ""f"" in printing. This is inexcusable."
5,Blessing...,There is a song for whatever I am going through..Truly a blessing to see the number of albums multiply over the years.
2,Basic tips for either handiness -- nothing special for left handers!,"The short version of how one can tell this was written by someone with minimal special skills in teaching left-handers: the author suggests writing on a white board for additional practice, which is a good tip for right-handers ONLY as left handed writing on a white board erases the text as you go.The only real concession for left-handers is that the book is spiral bound at the top. The practice tips in the book are just generic writing skill tips mostly suitable for either handiness. The alphabet font for the students to practice is an odd one, that is more difficult and less practical -- no idea what the author was thinking there (they thought it looked good?). Also limited in the amount of content for each letter. The content is not really grouped appropriately for progression of letter forming skills.Not completely useless in general, but has very little added practicality for the left handed student."
2,Would not fit Rossi 38 as advertised.,"Disappointed, because I really liked the look. There are two metal ovals in the base of the grip that sort of align with the pin in base of the the frame - and will not allow the grip to fit properly. It gapped at least 1/32 of an inch at the base. The area of the grip involved was rough looking,and may have been a manufacturing defect. Had to return the grip, and Amazon did a very fast refund. Ordered a second, which should arrive soon. We'll see!Update - Have tried three of these now - none had the holes for the pin at the base of the pin drilled correctly - they were both in the wrong place on at least one side and not nearly deep enough on at least one side. My gun is a Rossi small frame 38 Special for what it is worth. I am going to quit bugging Amazon and give up. But, as always, their return policy and service is outstanding."
3,One drawback,"These are comfortable grips with one drawback. On the Rossi 38 special, five-shot model I own, the grips interfere with ejection and use of a speed loader. Solving the ejection problem is just a matter of rotating the cylinder. The speed loader impediment can only be solved by shaving off part of the grip as far as I can tell. I haven't been willing to do it - yet."
3,not really what I expected,"As a yoga instructor I am always looking for new music for my classes. Though I enjoy listening to this music on my own, it really isn't usable for my classes. The 30 second sample was not really representative of the rest of the song."
3,last nite,Always loved vitamin C music this is no exception .she has a great voice and can sing ballads and rock songs
4,Bench,Super easy to put together. Looks great. Colors true to web. Just what I was looking for to set up room.
5,For my princess,I ordered the Levels of Discovery Princess Toy Box Bench for my three year old daughter and I absolutely love it.It is truly a good buy for any princess. I order the item on 01/14/11 and received it 01/18/11. I must admit I am a hard person to please but this is a worthwhile purchase. No regrets. My seventeen year old son assembled it in less than an hour. My princess then read to her stuff animals on it shortly after.
4,an entertaining first novel,"I have completely enjoyed reading this book. The prose crackles with the sly, sometimes arrogant wit of the author, and the plot (well, I use that term loosely) is engaging and the characters intriguing. Pop and subculture references abound, and some of the more obscure references are worth a snicker to the reader with eclectic tastes. One of the more amusing facets of the book is the way the author inserts himself into the story with a nod and a wink (or perhaps a raised glass) to the reader. One of the things I liked most about this work was the blend of supernatural and conspiritorial elements; Did they combine into a cohesive plot? Well, this writer is perhaps not qualified to say. Buy it and read it, even if you decide you hate it, I challenge you not to be entertained."
5,I feel dirty and wholesome at the same time,"This is probably one of the most interesting books I've read in a long time. It's got the same drug addled absurdity that Robert Anton Wilson is so skilled at creating. When one character is haunted, harrassed and cursed by ancient egyption gods, I felt certain that this disturbed author was on copious amounts of marijuana and alcohol. This is a good thing! There's an edge that makes it unique.If you like Robert Anton Wilson, Umberto Eco or Flann O'Brian you will probably dig this book. It's also loaded with Discordian refrences so if you're into that it adds considerable depth."
2,Where's the ending?,"I was very disappointed with this book. Although I liked the characters, and enjoyed many of the situations they were put into (the reason it gets two stars from me), I was quite put off by the writer's clumsy and toothless gimmick of injecting himself - a godlike being, the author - as a character in his own book. Bo-ring! And the ending? There is no ending! Auuugh! Perhaps this is the first book in a trilogy? If not, it's even worse. Don't waste your money. Buy anything from Dan Brown, instead."
3,"Beautiful scenery and people, weak plot","OK, it's not too painful to spend two and a half hours looking at Hugh Jackman and the little boy who played Nullah. I got teary at the points where the director was clearly trying to jerk tears, and it is a gorgeous travelogue for Australia. Yet the plot has holes you could drive one of those Army trucks through and the characters were pretty superficial. In 2.5 hours you'd think a little time could be devoted to character development, but instead it was spent on special effects for a cattle stampede near a cliff. How is it that Lady Sarah is trilling in that really annoying high-pitched squeal over kangaroos one minute (god was that irritating) yet herding cattle shortly thereafter? Nor is there any reason for her to get so attached to Nullah except that he's so darn cute. Just not very believeable. Watch this one when you want some eye candy without a lot of thinking involved."
3,Beautiful photography,It is beautiful. The actor's are gorgeous. Looking at Kidman's and Jackman's beauty is an added addition to the movie. It is a much needed addition because it doesn't have much to say. The young boy is wonderful as is his grandfather. But the storyline is average. So three stars is all I could give it because although it had a good story-line it really didn't go anywhere with it. The ending was a delightful surprise. But it was light having a taste of ambrosia without really being able to enjoy.
2,Dissapointed...,"I was soooo looking forward to seeing this movie and was so dissapointed in it. The plot isn't the best, acting was good but not great and it was way too long for what it was...would recommend another movie."
1,Australia,Unable to view on my BluRay.. The DVD did not work as it stated unable to view! Have no idea why my player works with all my other DVD's!
3,It was a gift.,"I bought this as a gift, and have never watched it. So I chose a neutral rating. The person who received it as a gift loved it though."
3,The cultural impact part was stronger than the cheesy romance,"Actually, I only watched it because I really like Hugh Jackman in Les Miz and I wanted to see what else he'd done. Australia starts out like a lame romance, but it improves dramatically by the end. Overall I think it's a great movie to watch for cultural reasons, and it does stop being cheesy."
5,Play it again,"Fast paced, riveting, suspensefull. I throughlly enjoyed this movie and I think you will too. Kidman and Jackman are great and the rest of the cast are equally as good. The settings are breathtakingly stunning. First time I saw the movie, on DVD, if I had been alone I would have hit the play button again."
4,Good Movie,This film is very entertaining. There is a scene where a house and a child come out of the water and it is just a brillant moment in cinemotography. Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman are amazing in this movie.
3,Lazy rainy day flick,"If you like old-fashioned (1940s-50s) epic movies then kick back on the sofa and enjoy the morning, afternoon or evening with Australia. This movie is long and ambitious. A lot of it is cornball but it works for this retro-movie. It is a big drama and suspenseful at times. Very sentimental, I did tear up a couple times. The cinematography is often gorgeous. I thought Hugh Jackman and Nicole Kidman had plenty of chemistry. And the Aboriginal boy is a doll! Effective villains, well played by the actors. I paid $9 and it's worth that. I was torn between giving it 3 or 4 stars. May watch it again and amend."
1,bad...... very bad,"i had hign hopes for this film, heard good things, but when i attempted to watch this movie I was greatly dissapointed, if i were to summarize things i found the movie to be a mess, a fantasy movie can be entertainingand you are ok with the fact it is a fantasy, a dramatic film can draw you in with the realistic perfomances and themes, this movie tries to be both and fails at each, after watching this dog for 90 minutes, just gave up had no interest in what happens to these people. like 1 reviewer said "" i hoped it would get better, but it never did"" ditto for me"
1,a simply awful movie,This one is so bad I could not finish it. The only worthwhile feature is the photography of Australia. What a looser.
3,Feelings about Australia,The only reason I did not give this movie a 5 Star Rating is due to the cost.The color and resolution and audio were outstanding and very enjoyable.But I buy very few Blue Ray movies as the cost is excessively high. Even at the reduced rate that Amazon sells them for.
3,Nice scenery!,"Nicole Kidman is awesome. I learned a little bit about Australia, Aborigines and ""the lost generation"". Very interesting."
2,a major disappointment,"I suppose I have the disadvantage of having seen too many movies in a moderately long life, which means I could predict every cliched moment of this effort way in advance. Is there any hackneyed plot device that was left out of this overly long and exhausting melodrama? I have always considered Nicole Kidman a competent actress but in this she constantly overacts in a strained attempt to mimic some kind of emotional range. The soundtrack is awful except for the bit of Elgar they steal for the last scene."
2,this movie was a disappointment,"this movie was not a typical Baz Luhrmann movie. i don't mind it when directors stray from their usual genre, in fact i encourage it, but this movie screenplay read like a trashy romance novel. i was not impressed. i kept waiting for it to end- repeatedly thinking that the end had arrived and then being forced to sit through yet another weakly plotted twist. it was big on the screen as all Baz movies are, but it didn't capture me the way Moulin Rouge or Romeo + Juliet did."
2,What was this supposed to be ?,"What was this supposed to be ?Based on the previews we thought we were going to see some large scale epic ""Gone With The Wind"" type drama with classy elegance .......Instead AUSTRALIA started right out of the gate with a strange blend of campy humor, cheesy action, tounge in cheek jokes, poor Clint Eastwood impersonations, etc..etc..etc..It felt like the movie did not know what it wanted to be .. humor, drama, epic, ?????After 40 minutes my wife screamed at me ..... ""Please take that DVD out, I can't take anymore. This is just bad""That about sums it up.Certainly not deserving of Kidman and Jackman (both of whom we like)."
1,The 1 Stars Are Right - Its Bad,"The 1*s are right this is a bad movie. Hugh Jackman, was the only watchable character and I really like him, but I wouldn't watch it again even for him. I was told that the first 20 minutes were disjointed, but stick with it. Well only have of that statement was true, it isn't just the first 20 minutes it is the whole thing. White people bad aborigines good. It feels like the producers took parts from several movies such as Dancing with Wolves and Far and Away combined them and set it in Australia. The scenery maybe beautiful but it looks like most of it was constructed on a computer. Nicole Kidman is wooden and boring and the other characters are just that, other characters. Don't worry, you have seen them before over and over and over again. Even the soundtrack is an uninspiring rip-off. I would choose the Man From Snowy River hands down to this over produced self indulgent film."
1,AUSTRALIA,I purchased this DVD and I am very dissappointed that I can't play it on any of my four DVD players. I will have to consider carefully buying from America again as I don't want to waste my money buying Region 1 DVD'S and still having to buy them here. This is the first time it has happened and I have been steadily building up my library of DVD'S from Amazon.
2,Mish mosh movie,"A DVD that went right into the garbage can. Seems to be bits and pieces taken from other movies, (Amer.) put together. It is confusing the primitive aborigines with normal Americans. Total nonsense."
2,A little too much....,This movie had a little toooo much action in it! A bit long! Kinda creepy... Good leading man though...
5,Lovely,What a beautiful movie. The Australia scenery is spectacular. Hugh and Nicole make a super couple. Very moving story with great history. This is one I will rewatch again and again.
1,A travesty in film making!,"Honestly, Baz REALLY screwed this one up. This is one of the worst films I've seen in years. The story and script are simply terrible, and the way in which Baz attempts to tackle Australian issues just comes off as tacky as you can get. The painted Aboriginal and the token silent Chinese immigrant were the last straw for me - haven't switched of a blu-ray in a while. The ONLY good thing about this film is some stunning cinema photography.AVOID!"
1,Random Trash,"It's been a long time since I had to end a movie in less than a 1/2 hour of watching it. In this case, I'm not sure if it even made it to 15 mins. The beginning scenes were so scattered that it was difficult to get a feel for the movie. Then, is it supposed to be a drama, comedy, anyones guess. Appeared to be ""Gone with the Wind"" meets ""Road Warrior"". Awful!!"
1,It should have stayed Down Under!,"Did this movie get any better after the first hour?I wouldn't know, it was all that I could handle with just the first 60 minutes. This was just a very poorly done movie and despite my interest in seeing Nicole Kidman, her high brow English accent and stiffness grated on my nerves. They made a mistake turning this into a comic book style of adventure story. It would have been better to take it more seriously and give the peripheral characters more...well, more character! At least it was only a single buck wasted from Red Box and not the price of a movie ticket."
1,"Big; Bloated, & Boring","Two big stars;(Jackman,& Kidman),a cute kid actor; gazillions spent on CGI; and it's too long, and too scattered to hold your interest. Kidman & Jackman have no chemistry; the kid is the most interesting character in the film; and at least 5 times you think the film is over--and then it isn't. It's not god-awful; its just way too long and uninteresting to give it nearly 3 hours of your time. If you want to watch a GREAT movie about Australia get ""Quigley Down Under"" with Tom Selleck."
3,A bit corny (but pretty good) Romance,"I (for the most part) enjoyed Australia, the acting was a bit over the top, and the plot meandered quite a bit, but was over-all pretty entertaining once it settled in.It is a bit long, and has three separate plot lines.1: The Apartheid that was practiced by Australia.2: A business crime plot3: A romance.Each of which was pretty good individually but for me, they didn't quite mesh as well as they might. For those interested in the Apartheid plot and the ""Stolen Generation"" You might enjoy the filmRabbit-Proof Fencethat documents this ugly period in Australia's history.So, here's the deal Australia is a pretty good movie, but would have been a better mini- series."
3,A cross between a western and a war story,"Few Americans realize that native American children were shipped away to eastern schools to be civilizedjust as the children Australian aborigines. The pattern of trying to break the chain of culturein subject peoples is very common in the pattern of empires.Here we have an Australian cattle baron trying subdue his competition.An English Lady finds her husband dead and a cattle drive is necessary to save thestation. ""Drover"" is her answer. After the cattle drive success they settle in to awet and dry cycle until the Japanese invade and the young mixed breed boy ( a creamy)is sent to a mission school on an island.The end result is full of suspense and romance.In the end a family of survivors results.I liked the movie, but somehow the acting and script isn't good enough thatlove the good guys and hate the bad guys?"
5,"Australia, don't miss this one","Wonderful cinematography, good cast, great story. If you love good story telling set around historic events, you will love this movie. It's always a joy to watch Nicole, and Hugh keeps up with the multi-talented Kidman."
2,Western + Gone with the Wind + Rabbit Proof Fence - but poorly executed,"The director tried to do too much in this mega-epic. It is a mix of a Western, Gone with the Wind and Rabbit Proof Fence all rolled into one. I am a big fan of Hugh Jackman and Nicole Kidman but I am disappointed by the overall execution of this film. By trying to do too much, it misses the details."
2,Australia during WWII,"Considering many important aspects of events in Australia during WWII, I was very disappointed with this film. The first third of the film is either comedy or parody of the British aristocracy and roughness of Australian outback population. I was unable to determine which. Second third of a movie takes a little more serious approach addressing the issue of treatment of bi-racial children and creation of a special class of mixed race population with their role in society clearly defined by the racist notion of ""where they belong"". And the conclusion of the movie turns out to be a sappy romance with a very sexy Hugh Jackman and lip plumped Nicole Kidman (whatever she is doing to her face to make herself look younger is NOT working - she no longer looks natural). Great movie idea, poor delivery."
2,UGH!! Maybe I expected too much...,"I thought I was settling in with a beautiful, epic film.... not a piece of cheesy fluff. I expected beautiful scenery and cinematography...but most of it looked fake. I must have just misunderstood what I was getting. I only finished it because I had laundry going and bread baking....no worries about getting caught up in it and letting clothes wrinkle and bread burn.Ugh."
1,VERY BAD FILM,"The Blu-ray presentation of this terrible film is excellent. The movie itself is so bad that it is beyond belief. This film may be the ultimate low point in Nicole Kidman's career. If one wants to see how bad a film can turn out, just watch this clunker.I give it one star only for the Blu-ray quality, otherwise it is one of the worst films of 2008."
1,UN-WATCH-ABLE,Are you kidding me - what a complete mess! Nicole and Hugh have as much chemistry as ice and oil - yuck!Baz needs to go to Director's Hell forever for this one - no kidding!
4,A wonderful Movie,I went to see this with my aunt and we both liked it. The sceneary was beautiful and the acting was out of this world. Hugh Jackman was major eye candy. this is one of Nicole's best movies.
5,MASTERFUL,"I saw this movie in Laughlin, Nevada with my parents and i dare say for it not get one oscar nomination makes me very upset because i felt this is worthy of an oscar like best picture."
1,Faulty Discs!,"We put 7 copies of this out to rent at our store, and VERY many people brought them back as unplayable. We finally figured out that the spindle hole is off-center. It plays in our machines, but makes a racket bouncing around in there. Can't be good for the machine, may have toasted our home DVD player which has been acting up since.One customer had gotten a copy which didn't work from an online rental company, so they came to our store looking for another that might play for them. We couldn't help them.Nobody's Blu-ray or Xbox360 will play it.We are ordering a second batch with hopes it might be trouble-free. It's been a GREAT renter."
1,Not Good,"The story line was interesting at times. The acting had some high points. Other than that, not good. The ""artistic"" (?) use of superimposing the actors was confusing. I guess it was supposed to look fake and ""Wizard of Oz"" like. I didn't get it. It was overly hyped. I fell asleep."
2,"dances with wolves, austrlia edition","Before I watched this movie I knew little about it other than it was nominated for some Oscars. After watching it I wonder why it got these nominations. just like Dances with Wolves, evil white men do bad things to the natives, some good white men (women) are sympathetic to the natives, live with them and discover how good the natives are. The plot can't be more predictable. the whites (other than the main characters) are all bad, natives are all good. very politically correct."
1,one star is one too many...,One star is one star too many for this over blow plotless epic......It is a sleeper alright ; but not in the good way!
2,So Boring So Predictable So Obvious FX,"The plot was totally predictable -- first Australia was made into the Wild West of America, same characters, same plot, same good guys and bad guys, same movie you saw Howard Hawks do better a dozen times; then the WW II movie with the bad guy Japanese, kind of Pearl Harbor, the movie, unfortunately with the same FX badly faked footage of Japanese Zeros coming in and bombing everything; the special effects FX just too fakey to be taken for anything but a video game....I know I could not make a movie of a blade of grass growing but then I dont claim to be a movie maker --- all that money, all that work, for a dull re-run of old Westerns and old WW II flicks jammed together into one unendingly boring ordeal of special effects that dont look real. Not easy to sit through."
4,Australia,"Great water scene with Hugh Jackman (whew!). The young Aboriginal boy is INCREDIBLE (and a beautiful child to boot). Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman connect well, but it bothers me that Hugh's character only has the name ""Drover"" throughout the movie. Come on! He has no name?! The cinematography is excellent, but the storyline is a bit weak and easy to figure out. On a scale from 1 to 10, I give it a 7-1/2."
4,Australia,This an epic movie with old style panoramic views.Excellent pictures of the Australian outback. Acting istrue to the time the movie is placed in. Overall veryenjoyable.
1,Aus,The movie is not good and my playback was terrible. The plot is really patchy with big big holes.visually it looks like a dusty Instagram filter was put over everything
1,Australia,"I received the DVD and by the time I was able to sit down to watch it, the warranty had run out. The DVD does not work. It continues to load and then an error icon lights up. My other DVD's play so I know it is not my DVD player."
3,Okay Movie,"The movie is okay, nothing really great but if you're a Hugh Jackman fan, it's a must have for your movie collection."
4,Really enjoy it!,"This is a truly great movie. I watched with my family and we all enjoyed. Great story, an utterly vibrant and beautiful way, the audience is shown an epic film filled with tragedy, truth, unfairness, redemption, hope, sacrifice, loyalty and love. It would be nearly impossible for anyone to walk away from this film without something worth holding onto."
5,The Love letter to Australia,"A fantastical and epic-style movie from the director of Strictly Ballroom, the beauty and intimacy of the characters and the country are well worth a viewing for, but the stark and heartwarming way the movie tackles the tragedy of The Lost Generaions makes it a classic"
4,A bit long but a good flick,"OK, it's a little long. But let's check out what's inside: It's got comedy, drama, action, a cattle drive, some scheming scoundrels,a war, racism and anti-racism, romance, and one charming kid. It's got a manly hero and a rather diverse performance by the leading lady. There's something for everyone and some historical perspective as well. There are some genuine wholesome laughs. I don't consider it a children's movie. But if you want an entertaining way to spend a rain afternoon, I'd recommend it."
4,All the endings were good,"I loved this movie. I really enjoyed the way it was filmed, not atall what i expected but really liked it. The movie was super long but i still enjoyed it. There were about three parts in the movie were it could have ended but continued onto another part of the story, but i still enjoyed every new story that emerged. Nicole Kidman did great acting and Hughe Jackman was also very good, their chemistry between eachother played off very well."
4,A guilty pleasure,"This film is thoroughly entertaining and visually and musically stunning. Without giving up the story, Baz Luhrmann is again operatic in his storytelling. The most operatic scene contains a boys choir, ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"" and Aboriginal chanting in the background that ties the themes of the movie together beautifully. His hero (Hugh Jackman) and heroine (Nicole Kidman) have an undeniable chemistry and it is fun to see their characters predictably come together. Hugh Jackman portrays his character with effortless vulnerability that is a joy to watch. The child star, Brandon Walters, is enchanting. His eyes are so soulful. He is the most believable child actor I've ever seen on film. If you are a sucker for a fine romance that is epic - shamelessly so - and can overlook the computer-generated effects that don't quite mesh - this is the guilty pleasure for you."
2,What the heck was that?,"I'm sorry but I really didn't like this movie. I'm really glad I rented it instead of seeing it in the theater as I planned. The film didn't seem to know what it wanted to be - serious - comedy - camp , so it chose to be all of them. There were parts I found funny but I'm not sure I was supposed to. I did think the woman running next to the truck at about 30 mph was kinda funny. Then it goes into a campy cattle drive which ends in tragedy (again it switches gears). The ""villain"" should be wearing a Snidely Whiplash mustache. Anyway if you like it fine. I just didn't care for it."
2,"Good intentions, bad execution.","I had good expectations from this movie considering the cast included two big names and subject is quite a likable country. Unfortunately the result was less than expected. Actors delivered mediocre performance, story was very thin at best but worst of all was the direction of the movie. The director's clear intention to make an OZ version of ""Gone with the wind"" ended up being a bad publicity for people who were involved in the movie. For its credit some shots and special effects were quite good but wasn't enough to help the end result. This could have been a movie to brand a country (not sure how much Australia needs branding). As much as I dislike big budget Hollywood productions, after seen this non-Hollywood big shot movie, I felt for the first time they (Hollywood)seem to be doing better job in these types of projects.Sort of the story, this movie is really not worth spending close to three hours in front on the screen."
3,Australia,"Love the photography but the movie seemed disjointed; did not flow as well as I expected it to. I like the cast but they also seemed rather stiff. Sorry, had a lot of promise"
4,Very good,"The critics were not kind to this movie, so I was mildly surprised that it was so good.Add it to your collection.."
2,better than campy but not actually good,Hugh Jackman and Nicole Kidman are gamely giving it their all in this bit of nonsense about a cattle drive and the invading Japanese via Baz Luhrmann. Sure you can turn off your brain and sort of enjoy this overripe romp but please don't confuse that with being told that it's actually good. Visit me at michaelgiltz dot com.
5,A movie that will DEFINITELY stand the test of time!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Just like a bunch of other wonderful films that stupid critics justliterally bashed and trashed to bits(perfect examples: ""SOMEWHERE IN TIME"",""THE GHOST AND THE DARKNESS"",""ANNA AND THE KING"",etc.)""AUSTRALIA""didn't fair too well at the box office nor at the academy awards.That is thePERFECT REASON why I never listen to movie critics!Instead,I go and bethe critic myself!As many of the other reviewers have stated,this filmfeatures some of the most breathtaking and gorgeous cinematography toever do the actual country of Australia justice!Not only that,it alsorecaptures the feel of Hollywood's classic 'Golden Era' of films andfilmmaking at its finest!NICOLE KIDMAN and HUGH JACKMAN deserved academyawards for their OUTSTANDING portrayals of their characters!Hollywoodshould make more movies like this one and THEN SOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,I like it,Some may not like this film. Its very long (3 hours) and has the hints of the old epic movies of the 40s. Its very romantic and grand. It reminded me of The Mummy cuz it can be funny and charming. But it is so long and it felt like two movies tied into one. But very good.
4,Distant movie - Review from down-under,"I watched this movie with an open-mind. I had heard and read the various positive and negative reviews about it.I found the acting was ok in this film. The actors had to work with the script, so you can't blame them if the script is lacking. The storyline, whilst somewhat interesting but lacking in originality, just seemed to lack any depth. This shouldn't have been the case though because the film went for nearly 3 hours. Perhaps there was just too much happening in this movie to enable any issue to be covered adequately (trying to save cattle property, stolen generation, world war 2, romance...).The romance between the Kidman and Jackman seemed to come on all of a sudden, with no romantic build-up. The plot (or should I say plots) was/were far too distant for my liking."
1,re-packaged tripe w/o creativity,"The story-line is so totally paint-by-numbers, one feels that if the producer / director should stay home, any administrative assistant could finish the movie. The wasting of Hugh Jackman, who starts off the movie with a ridiculous slapstick fight sequence is bad enough, but when Nicole Kidman, so brilliant in Cold Mountain, is forced into sophomoric dialogue amidst a dull and boring plot, you can see why Russel Crowe bolted on this loser.Yes, the rolling landscapes are nice, but National Geographic i wasn't looking for."
1,"What a dog! (or should I say ""dingo""?)","This is the first review I've ever submitted on Amazon. I had to write one after viewing this movie, only to warn others to stay away from it.It is just a ridiculous movie. It's like a live action cartoon. It should be sold as such. It's not serious enough to be considered a drama, it's not (intentionally) funny enough to be considered a comedy. It's bad acting (Nicole Kidman, what have you done?), and the characters move about like Keystone Cops. Stay away from this one. If you've already made the mistake of buying it, you might want to throw this one on the barbie."
1,EXCRUCIATINGLY PAINFULLY DUMB,"This movie kind of sucked. Most of the acting (especially Kidman's) was bad and over the top, the script was cheesy and predictable, the bad guys were so 'evil' that is made them laughable, the music was mediocre, and the movie just WOULDN'T END!!!! I kept thinking, ""Okay, this is the end finally, yeah!"" But the director just kept stringing it out, and really, how many climaxes do you need? He put in like five of them! It was really annoying. That being said, Hugh Jackman's acting was pretty good, and plus, he's really cute. But the movie was terrible."
1,Boring!,"Pros- Beautiful cinematography- Great acting by Nicole Kidman & Hugh Jackman in spite of a stupid scriptCons- Boring- slow- Story is not realistic, simplistic, predictable, melodramatic,- Way, way too long, even when I put the movie on fast forward it was too long!"
2,"Tea: Oh, drasted...yuck.","Overall, I was sorely disappointed in the lack of story. While the cinematography was breathtaking, without a story there is no movie. Well, unless you make a make a documentary of just the landscape...but even then, you still need a story.The story follows a British aristocrat wife, who is forced to go down to Australia to see to her interests in cattle.ranch.Characterization was poorly lacking, coupled with a weak story = certain death. It could have been a very powerfully compelling story, hooked the audience, and really taken us on an amazing journey of Australia and made us emotionally invested in the story.Poor writing, is what I'd say.We didn't make it past 18 min in...have rarely had that happen...ever.I would not purchase this movie, or ever watch it again."
1,MONUMENTALLY BORING,There is a reason why this movie wasn't nominated for many Oscars and those few were for technical items. The first half is a sappy comedy and the second half an over-wrought mess. Australia is a beautiful country but it seemed that many of the vistas were green screen and digitally generated. Jackman might be a good Oscar telecast host but he will never will an Oscar himself.
3,Good movie,"AustraliaPlot: Interesting. The first half of the movie appeared to be directed by someone other than the person who directed the second half. The first half of the movie prepares the viewer for the second half of the movie but it's slow, meandering, and I felt a bit confused about what the central point of the movie was. The second half rolls around and the pace quickens, there's urgency, drama, death, destruction, reunions.Scenery: WonderfulOverall: Good movie. I'd watch it again."
3,poor start up,"I did not like the font used. This was the worst I have ever seen used any where. The starting story line was flawed. It started in the middle went back in time then proceed on, not so good. The rest was OK. For those who the saw the early film it was lacking something. In all a bad remake of the era. The plot should have been the stole generation, and maybe had a focus on the white Australia policy. In Darwin and W.A. at that time the return of Chinese refugees off the boats back to face the japs, and execution in Singapore was common. Bad history there. Not enough not by far!"
3,OK for Brit film,"While I liked this historical novel, it was difficult hearing good and understandable audio. Perhaps this was due to analog to digital recording."
5,good movie,enjoyed this movie. then bought 2 more copies for friends. friends and family still borrow this movie from time to time
5,Great tissue movie!,"Great story and Nicole Kidman is great, as usual. You will love the storyline and the ups and downs in this true love story. Make sure you have the tissues close by. A movie my husband loved to. Not just a ""chick flick.""B. Seifert"
3,Big epic movie,"Although this movie didn't get good reviews from the professional reviewers, it's well worth taking the time to watch it. This is probably the best acting that Nicole Kidman has done to date and Hugh Jackman continues to ace every part he plays.The story takes place before the second world war in Australia, naturally. Whatever you didn't know about Australia and the aborigines and what the Japanese did to Darwin, you will know when the movie is done. Although sometimes the Aussie accents are a little difficult to understand by the time the movie is over you will know exactly what has taken place. It was interesting to see that the Australians were not a lot better to their aborigines than we were to our Native Americans and the black slaves."
2,A simple morality tale. Too much cattle on screen.,"A very simple story, no reason they had to make it so darn long! Pretty much a western set down under. The aboriginal sub-text is PC, but overall trite without really much heart. I got sick of watching the cattle drives too, who cares. I'm glad our rental CD failed have way through and I could request a refund."
4,Grand Epic,"I sometimes wonder if my fondness for this film stemmed from the fact that I first heard about it in Australia and I was missing it so much. But anyway....I knew this was a long film when I went and I was very worried at the beginning. Now that I own the DVD I'll be skipping the first twenty minutes or so. The scenery is outstanding, as are the costumes. However the movie begins to drag on occasionally, but nothing as bad as the first half-hour.The tie-in with Wizard of Oz was very creative and an interesting juxtoposition as well as a play on words.I really enjoyed most of the film. I do not feel that it is a family film, there are some gruesome scenes, implied sex scenes, and intense action.It has seemed to have lost a little of the granduer on my little television with regular sound. But I still find it awesome in execution. Well worth a look, especially for people who enjoy epics, Hugh Jackman, or the marvelous land of Oz."
1,DVD delivered to Spain,"Second DVD delivered to my home address in Spain which does not play in this region. Amazon agreed to my returning same. As a dummy I had not realised about the regional playing, which I would have thought Amazon would have picked up?"
2,Schlockfest,"There are some very charismatic actors in this film, particularly David Wenham, who plays the half-aboriginal child. But while the historical circumstances and cultural issues which the film exploits are indeed moving, I cannot recall the last time I experienced a screenplay this melodramatic & heavy-handed. At the height of the film's dramatic climax, I burst out laughing because the scene was so contrived it had begun to (strongly) resemble a comic opera. The film is pretty to watch and the aboriginal theme is inherently intriguing, but honestly I thought the writing in ""Beverly Hills Chihuahua"" was far superior."
5,I LOVE NICOLE KIDMAN,"I THOUGHT THIS WAS A FIRST CLASS MOVIE, BUT THEN I AM PREJUDIST !!!! BECAUSE I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN INLOVE WITH NICOLE KIDMAN !! BUT THIS IS A GOOD MOVIE, GOOD ACTING, GOOD STORY, GREAT SCENERY AND JUST ALL AROUND GOOD, WHICH IS RARE THESE DAYS !!"
2,Not a second time watch,Not a second time Watch . OK movie . Lengthy .1. Nicole Kidman played her role to the max. Hugh Jackman was good also. The Kid was GOOD too .2. Spectacular scenery . I have never been to Australia but liked the visuals of outback AustraliaOveral a GOOD Movie .
2,Okay at best.,"First, I am not a Kidman fan. There is a big difference between being a movie star and an actor. This film proves it. She is attractive, used to be married to Tom Cruise, so she is famous, but is totally outclassed by the material in this film. The film had some okay moments, but never when she was on screen. I laughed towards the end when a window explodes in her face, then in the next scene where she appears, there's not a scratch on her face! They'll do lots of crazy things in movies for the sake of ""realism,"" but they wouldn't want to have Kidman look bad.Jackman was good, the boy was great, but I'd like to see a movie about the King George character. he was fascinating.Even the special effects were poor. The end made no sense. Not recommended."
3,better than expected,this movie reminds me of the movie pearl harbor. a love story wrapped around another story. i purchased the blu ray and it is gorgeous . great color and sound.
5,To leave this time & place for an older and wiser world,"For all the romantics, realists, and wish a ""near"" clean sight of an older and much more real time where things were the way they were. If you loved another you said so; if you hated another; one way or another, you said so, or did something about it. This story has the hard real facts and the actors to appropriately protray them with unusual protrayal as having the real feelings. As is ""Gone with the Wind"" has taken its' place for all time, Australia will site side by side with it for all time."
2,"A very long string of hackneyed cliches, bad acting, and melodrama so thick you could cut it with a knife","Admittedly, Hugh Jackman is really sexy in a beard, but that wasn't enough to hold a 165-minute film together. (Mostly because Nicole Kidman is about as sexy as a Mouskateer. It takes two to tango.) The plot was so relentlessly predictable, I spent most of the movie groaning in pain. (The neighbors called to ask if I needed a doctor.) Add over-acting, under-acting, bad writing, melodramatic death scenes that were so overdone they seemed like spoofs, plot holes the size of Kansas and, in spite of supposedly being about Australia, very little genuine feel for the country, and you've got another sure-fire Academy Award."
2,Australia,"big dissapointment. they used too much computer generated scense, story line was very weak. Foucsed too much on the kid. do not recommend waiting money on blu-ray version."
2,Austrailia,"It seems the movie industry thinks a ""blockbuster"" (big movie-big names) have to be LONG! This movie was interesting, at times. But drifted over so many sub-plots, the viewer was exausted. Needed a good editor. Sure everyone was beautiful, Nichole, Hugh, Australia, the boy; but too long and too predictible."
1,Awful,"I live in Melbourne, Australia and am a fan of Baz. I gave this a decent go but what an awful, cheesy, ridiculous, badly written and badly acted bunch of kangaroo dung!Nothing to enjoy here, over the top accents, stupid characters, I wanted them all to die.One of the worst Australian films in record. Watch ""storm warning"" instead or ""rouge"" if you want to see a decent slice of Australia and avoid this like the plague."
5,Good Story-Excellent Performance- Spectular Country-,"Austrailia ..... a most interesting place for this story. The acting is excellent, Nicole Kidman and Huge Jackman are a great team and very comfortable with each other. The setting is spectular ... and keeps you completely involved with it's story-line. A good movie for all ages ... and it's nice to watch where there isn't a lot a foul language. Our family enjoyed this movie and our neighbors borrowed it."
5,"great movie, great service",I got the movie in great condition in a very timely manner. Would do it again with this seller in a heartbeat.
4,A great book but...,"I don't like some of the stories being ""tampered with"" - the authors have abridged and simplified them. This may be OK for the target audience (students) but I would still prefer to enjoy these stories in their original form..."
2,good if you have nidhiki,"he's cool but get nidhiki first, they look great together,and are good villians for your collection, but by himself,he's just not worth the money."
1,Wrench not long enough,This wrench while made for an inline rifle is not long enough for the T bar to get beyond your scope. This is a big problem. It is basically worthless.
2,Don't bother...,"Save your money and pass on this book. Actually I'm a fan of Paul Vunak and I love his videos but this book doesn't cut it!If you are absolutely new to JKD then you may be interested, otherwise look at some other titles, even Vu's Anatomy of a Streetfight is OK (but padded with large pictures)."
5,Great Book - A Must Read,This is an excellent book which really takes JKD to the level where all Martial Artists can put it into practice.
2,Yikes!,"Sloppy and annoying to the ear! When I hear this I imagine sitting at the circus as child and watching midgets chase each other into a tiny car and seeing how many of them the ring-master can cram into it! Where is the care? This is all about the performer, not about Bach."
2,disappointed,this is the first disappointment from this company. all their other things so far are great. i am on the fence as to returning this one. it is attractive but it's way too expensive for what you get. the back is slightly pushed in and has scratches. it is lightweight and tinny. there is no catch to keep the locket shut so it will probably flop open. the only thing i will say that is good is that i am sure returns won't be a hassle.
5,Sturdy and comfortable,"I bought this table and chair set recently set for my two boys aged 6 and 4. I was a bit skeptical after reading some of the other reviews but I can safely say that any fears I had were allayed. I was very impressed with the quality of the construction and I had no issues with getting all the pieces assembled which took me about 30 minutes or so. My boys are very happy with it and use it to do their homework, writing/drawing and craftwork and so on. I think this set will last them for another 5 years at least unless they outgrow it before that."
5,Warning: Fabulosity Hawaiian Style,"Only buy this CD if you are interested in being entertained and enjoy listening to great music. The songs harken back to when I lived in Hawaii. I love Matt Yee. I'll Reinvent Myself is a timeless song that could be played on the radio today!Edit: I never ever reviewed this! I don't know who Matt Yee is and I don't use the word ""harken"" unless I'm using it for effect in a joke. Very weird."
1,Golf Course Home Designs,Do not be fooled. This is simply a rehash of previously published home designs. I found no real correlation between the title and the content. Save your $$.
1,Muligan Please,"This book had a good introduction. However, it needs to state in the book description that the plans included are for large lots. It states in the introduction that golf course lots are large -believe me, they are all not so. It mentions in the intro that the house plans are designed to include golf course views, a few are. I was dissappointed. On the two different courses we are considering, there are even zero lot lines, narrow lots, etc. None of these possibilities were included in this ""Golf Course"" floor plan book. We are also looking for around 2,000 square feet, these were not included in the book either. We found more suitable plans in ""Empty Nester"" and ""Narrow Lot"" books."
1,What a confusing title!,"I have a suggestion:Instead of calling this batch of throwaway garbage ""Heard It On The Radio"", a more appropriate title would have been either ""Found It In The Bargain Bin"" or ""Never Heard It On The Radio""."
1,Falls flat,"I was initially excited about this title. It seemed like an opportunity to develop some advanced techniques and learn them interactively with Matlab. Unfortuantely, I was disappointed upon reading the book. The topics themselves are not developed well by the authors and the Matlab examples are way too simple for them to be of any use or for the reader to gain insight. The material itself is somewhat eclectic, but for the price/value I just can't see it. A determinted researcher could find the same thing for free on the internet."
2,sloppy writing,"I ordered this book assuming to get something useful, but i got the impression while reading the book that it is like a collection of notes from other books, wrapped with some matlab code. More worrying to me was that the mathematics makes a sloppy impression. For me that means I cannot grab the book to lookup something and use the code without having to be concerned on the validity. The bottomline being I will not use it for applications and the book is a waste of money."
5,Excellent,"I bought ths product 4 weeks ago. It has excellent voice quality, switching between stations are extremely easy and fast. Just like traditional tuner. Preset stations are easy to configure and initial configuration is extremely easy. All you need to do is read the instructions.Ask me to trade my LCD HD TV or Roku? roku is the best and I can't give up.."
1,No support when there is a problem,These 1001 units have an upsampling problem that causes buzzing in the audio. It has been reported numerous times by many people on their forum and they have yet to fix the problem and will not respond to the complaints about the problem.
2,Roku - mediocre product at best,"I've had this product for approxiamtely three months and during that period I have streamed several movies. When it works it's great, but unforunately it doesn't work as advertised. It consistently drops the wireless local access connection, typically during the middle of a movie. And it takes days to get the connection back. If I weren't past the warranty period, I'd send it back. I also have a wireless laptop PC that works flawlessly in the same location, so it's not the FIOS wireless connection that's at fault."
5,Extremely helpful!,"This video is very well done - the information related helped put my wife at ease with the idea of getting a puppy. The production quality of this video is really superb, unlike some other pet videos. You can tell a lot of time & thought was put into making it. I would recommend it to anyone thinking about getting a dog, or who has recently got one - you will definately find useful ideas about training your dog."
4,pro-4000,this is the first tripod i have owned. the leg releases take a little getting used to but the other features work great...
3,"Good Performance, Decent Sound","This release is quite on par with others in the Hyperion line, following well in the footsteps of the Romantic Piano Concerto Series. The performances are good - somewhat understated, but in no way offensive or lame. A good, solid job by soloist and orchestra. Sound is in line with the usual from this source - very good but not outstanding (my reference point for outstanding orchaestral sonics is BIS). Those wanting all three works on a single disc would do very well by this release. Recommended."
4,Excellent book,Very informative book if you want to plant natives that save water and look pretty. Very worthwhile purchase. We are landscaping our front and back-yard and this is an invaluable source of information.
5,"Beautifully photographed, carefully researched",An indispensable guide for summer dry gardeners. Carefully researched and presented. Stunning photography by one of America's greatest garden photographers.
5,Worth the full price,"This book is as useful as it is beautiful.The photographs are inspiring, but the sheer volume of detailed text is terrific. It's like having an encyclopedia and coffee table book, all in one. Every January I pull it off the shelf to flip through the pages and dream of spring.I find it to be less commercial than Sunset Garden--less interested in design and trend, more in water-saving and ecology--but FYI, there is a lot of overlap. While if I could only have one book for California gardening, it would be Sunset's, this one is much more fun and inspiring."
5,A great garden guide for California!,This is one of the most helpful books I have ever purchased as a guide to what plants work best in the Mediterranean climate of many parts California. Illustrated with hundreds of color photos so that you can see what the plants look like. It also notes water requirements of each plant - I discovered I was watering plants that don't really want or need summer water.
4,Old Time Western fun!,My kids love to dance and sing to these songs wearing cowboy hats and guitars. It makes them feel like they are part of Woody's Gang themselves.
1,Instructor Edition,"I was sold an Instructor Edition. I do not want to say that I was cheated, as I do not remember reading any warning, but I hope that this does not happen in the future."
5,"The Prose Reader: Essays for Thinking, Reading and Writing (8th...","The Prose Reader: Essays for Thinking, Reading and Writing (8th...I needed this for a class I was taking. It was a great deal and well worth the money."
5,Great,This book was in great shape for being a used book. The owner definately takes care of the books they resale. I would by from them again if they had what I needed. Plus I ordered on a Friday and had it within the beginning of the following week.
5,One the best films I've ever watched with my family,"My sister had this video and I have searched for a place to buy it for a long time! The formal reviews weren't very good, but what do they know. It's funny, touching, and very enjoyable to watch for both adults and children!"
4,Great memories,Great movie! I remember seeing this at a drive-in theater in the 1980s. I don't think I've seen this movie since then. I forgot how cute the baby robots were.
5,Love this movie!,"I absolutely love this movie! and my children and grandchildren have loved it also! I think the Editorial review done here on Amazon STINKS! It probably didn't have enough blood and gore (like NONE) for his taste or not enough sex (again, NONE) which is what we parents really like in a movie! There are far too few movies that we can feel comfortable watching with our children or grandchildren. It is sappy, but there are alot of people out here that love sappy. It is really a cute movie and I would recomend it!"
4,dvd Batteries not included,I received what I wanted and it came in a reasonable time. It was in good shape. It was good service.
4,You can't hate this movie...but you will be depressed,"Oh man I never know how to feel when I watch this.Haven't seen it in years, but the underlying theme out with the old, in with the new (as in the old building, the people in it, the 'stillborn' little spaceship, etc) mixed with the menace of gentrification (hello Harlem) is still relevant. No one wants to feel like they are worthless, and useless. Even the guy who looks like Gomez Addams that has to get all the people out by any means necessary gets the point before the flick is over.If you are one of those crying people, have a tissue factory next to you when you watch this. Jessica Tandy shoots out the 'I live in the past because the present is too hard for me to deal with' vibe throughout the pic, and the old dude from Cocoon is also in the bulding, doing his best to sadden you.I am so sad. Watch this film and weep man...Im going to call my mommy:-("
1,*batteries Not Included,The Movie is Par Excellant.This release is P.U. It will not load in my new DVD player.Tried replaceing and same problem with second. Bad MFG batch.
4,"""Good Sci-Fi Film!""","Hume Cronyn, Jessica Tandy and more star in this 1987 sci-fifilm. Small spaceships help a group of apartment tenants fixtheir problems. I grew up watching this and always liked it.This dvd has decent picture and sound, but only the trailer.I recommend this good sci-fi film."
5,Batteries Not Encluded,"The movie Batteries not included is so good.... It will make you laugh and cry. I tried to purchase the movie from Disney.com they did have it. But, Amason came through for me again. Amason is great!"
4,Film review,Enjoyed the movies and it brought back memories that were most enjoyable. Good story with a wonderful ending. Recommend the movie to anyone who likes a slightly unusual story without the rubbish of today's films.
2,"Tame, Blase Sci-Fi That Has Oodles of Heart, Solid Special Effects and Little Else","Steven Spielberg plays executive producer for this cliche-laden, family-friendly sci-fi fairy tale, and it's got his fingerprints all over it. Loaded with plucky working class heroes, cute anthropomorphic critters, moments of agonizing forced charm and stereotypical corporate villainy, it still might have worked under a craftier director. Instead, a second-rate cast extracts every ounce of ham from a very dimly-written script while they flounder around a slow, dull storyline. The effects work is good for the period, a must since the real stars of the picture are the small, hovering mechanical aliens that drive the plot, but beyond that it's weak sauce even for a kids' picture."
5,Tandy and Cronyn at their best,"I recently bought this DVD after having loved the movie for years. My youngest son watched it with me in delight. While the special effects are not as clean as what we watch now, the ""little critters"" are too cute not to fall in love with. The plot line is a bronx brown stone about to be demolished to make way for new development. The developer tries to pay off the residents to leave and while a few do, the one that say are not going anywhere without a fight. Of course, a few metal aliens on your side never hurts in a fray. Lots of typical sterotypes for characters, but it is Jessica Tandy who's performance shines in this movie. She portraits an aging wife with alzeheimer's, who is still living mentally in the 1960 before her son was killed. Her performace is as poignant as it is accurate. If it would be nice to have a movie in your collection that has a happy compromise at the end, instead of death and bloodshed, this would be that movie."
4,"Funny, Exciting and Pulls at Your Heartstrings!!!","You will be laughing one minute, crying the next, then holding your breath to see what will happen next. It's a great all around movie, good for the whole family."
2,Family fun,"So this is one of those movies like et, or gremlins that holds a special place in your heart when you saw it when you where 13, and its not probably very good if you are 30 and watching it for the first time, and it has pretty 1990's special effects, but the movie is fun to watch with the kids and it has a lot of values in it to get and show the kids.Sure it represents Latinos in a poor light, but it is a product of its time and that is how Hollywood was then, I truly believe it has the power to capture a child's imagination (since i tried it with my niece and nephew and they loved it!) and teach them a lesson o two as well in humility and loyalty."
2,Smaller than it appears,"I purchased three of these for my sons and I was very disappointed. It is very cheaply made and a lot smaller then the pictures make it out to be. It was basically a small plastic container with a blank note card, a cheap little book to write memories in, etc. I could make a better time capsule myself with regular household items."
3,"Nice, but too bulky","The watch is handsome, and I had alot of my co-workers ask me about it, but its huge and gets tiresome at the end of the day."
5,Great product,I purchased this product to use with my smoker and I am very satisfied with it operation...I recommend this product to others!
3,Limited function,"Just be aware that this thermometer is ONLY for monitoring the internal temperature of your BBQ or smoker, NOT of the items being cooked.I failed to read the ""fine print"" and had to return it. It probably works well for that limited function although Maverick, historically, has a problem with the cables of their meat probes not withstanding BBQ heat."
3,This is my 2nd unit,"The 1st Maverick I purchased died due to a burned cable. You have to be really really REALLY careful to avoid letting this cable get too hot. In defense of the Maverick unit, it is possible that I allowed the cable to contact the heating element in my electric oven (in which case I really cannot blame the Maverick)."
1,Inoperable and another throw away purchase,Unable to get the product to operate. Threw it away and chalk it up to lesson learned about this manufacturer.Ron H
1,DIFERENT PRODUCT THAN THE PICTURE,THE PICTURE OF THIS PRODUCT IS DIFERENT OF I RECIVED.YOU SEE A BATTERIES FOR A SHAVER AND I RECIVED A FOIL FRAME I AM NOT AGREE WITH THAT BECUASE I NEED A PAIR OF BATTERIES LIKE THE PICTURE. THIS IS A BIG MISTAKE TO PUT A DIFERENT PRODUCT IN THE PICTURE AND THE DESCRIPTION ARE OTHER PRODUCT.
2,Limited audience,"I used this book in a course which was supposed to be an introduction to solid state. Know some basic ideas in crystal structure, quantum mechanics, statistical mechanics, advanced and partial differential equations and Fourier anlysis and then you'll begin to be ready to understand this text. Kittel's Solid State text is slightly more helpful (but only slightly). The book is completely devoid of examples, yet there are sections at the end of each chapter involving current applications and experiments in condensed matter physics and materials science. Exercises require a leap of understanding from the contents of the chapter before them. Some experience with a computer language may also be necessary. I wouldn't recommend this book for most undergrads."
5,Beautiful soft doll,"I bought this doll w/ brunette hair for my 4 year old. It's so soft and realistic looking, floppy like a real newborn, perfect weight for little ones to cradle. I'd been looking for a 'baby' doll w/ long hair - some of the other co's make them too heavy, not conducive for real play. This doll is also washable, a big plus. The hair is soft and very brushable, the face is sweet and the eyes open and close properly. A little pricier than your average doll but you can see the difference in the skin texture and facial features. Overall a very nice doll, high quality, hopefully will be played w/ for many years."
4,Pure Energy,"This album is pure energy. This album is so much better than his last one and much closer to his actual style. Definately worth the money. With that said there is still nothing-nobody-nowhere-nohow that compares to Bishop live. When he takes control nobody sits down. You don't even have to see him you can just feel it when he's on the decks. Don't ever, ever, ever, ever, ever miss the chance to see him live."
4,Just What I Wanted,"This book contained the hymn Abide With Me, Tis Eventide, which is VERY HARD TO FIND. I had heard it on the radio and searched all over to find a copy of it. A man who knows a great deal about hymns on the internet steered me to this book on Amazon and I was thrilled to have found it."
1,Kawasaki EN 500A,I own the en-500a motorcycle and there is not a lot of info for my bike in this book. I will check to see if a shop manual is available.
5,Worn out the Grooves on my 33-l/3,Why the heck can't I find this on CD? My record is all but worn out - just the best! Can't listen to a record in the car - what do I have to do to get this on CD?
1,Not what I thought it was,"Obviously I should have previewed the music first before buying any of it, but, I bought 4 mp3s before I realized this isn't the Dos Gringos I have been listening to and enjoying up until this point. Don't really know who this is, and I guess if cheesy, low-production campfire music is your thing, it's not horrendous, but, certainly I won't be listening to any more of it."
3,Not the same Dos Gringos,"If you are looking for fighter pilot music, it won't be found on this album. The music itself is competently played, but just beware that if your goal is to listen to somes like ""12-inch Penis"", this is not the album for you. I found this album through spotify while looking for the other gringos."
2,I hope there are better training pants than this.,"I expected better, but these training pants are not absorbent as expected. My daughter wakes up almost every morning with a wet pant. It leaks easily, even in the day. I take her to the bathroom every 2-3 hours. So it's not like she wears it for a long period of time. I don't expect leakage from her going just once in her pull ups, but it happens.Also when I started using this, for some reason my daughter gets a really bad rash on her hip. I think because of the material of the Pull-Ups being rubbed against her, while pulling up and down. I am disappointed in Huggies for this, because I relied on Huggies diapers more than any other brands. I was looking forward for the transition from diapers to training pants, but got disappointed.I got her potty trained without using any type of training pants, it's actually a faster process."
3,"3 Friends, 3 Doctors, 3 Stories, 3 Stars","At the beginning of the book, when Sondra, Ruth and Mickey met, and began to study medicine, tried to solve their problems, their family and became best friends is a very good story, after that, when each one finished and went each one to work to another part of the world, the only good story is Sondra's, the story of Mickey is good but not as Sondra's story, and the story of the selfish Ruth is the worst, another thing is that they are always best friends and they saw each other only once in more than fourteen years, is that possible?"
4,Takes me back to my childhood!,I remember reading this book when I was a child and it sure did bring back memories of a interesting babysitter! I can't wait for my child to be old enough to read it to.
1,Burn the Book!!,The whole stinkin book is about some woman that made up that she was abused and went to some therapist and ended up with a bunch of multiple personalities and left her pastor husband and her kids. In the end she is speaking at some seminar about the dangers of therapists.The whole book is like a kick in the stomach. It goes back and forth between the story line and talking about how people make up this stuff. It really hacked me off and hurt. The title of this loser of a book is Only God Can Heal the Wounded Heart by Ed Bulkley.This book heaps pain upon pain. The only thing this book is good for is throwing or burning.
2,Not John's best,"I am a hugh John Denver fan. I bought this album many years ago. I believe the year was 1977. I had heard several other albums by John at this time in my life and loved everything about his music. Until I played this one. I agree with the last reviewer. It is too dark and gloomy. I like to think of John as a positve and uplifting singer/song writer. I bought the CD to make my collection complete. However, if you are looking for a inspiring, uplifting John Denver album this one is not for you. Although, I try to look for positive messages in all of John's music, and there is some positve messages here for it's time. I don't believe the ocassional John Denver listener will enjoy this recording as much as some later recordings. Try his ""Spirit"" album, or his ""I Want To Live"" album. With these recordings you can't go wrong. They truly are, ""FAR OUT""!"
2,smells funny,"I really like the smell straight from the bottle, but after a day your hair starts to smell like old cheap beer. So if you are a recovering alcoholic and you dont want people throwing you stink faces, avoid this particular brand."
1,What A Mess,This item arrived with the shampoo pump not in the locked position which caused it to leak all over the place it was pack tightly so the box did not arrive leaking but once I opened it I had to clean off the bottle and lost about 25% of the shampoo. I would never buy this product from this vendor again. It was a total rip off and I should have just gone into the store.
3,love this product,"Great product, best shampoo and conditioner combo i have ever used on my hair. Personally, i have thin hair and this product seemed to make it more boncy and full... and it smells amazing!"
4,I like it but,"I like both products, it does make my hair look thicker. However, I have to apply more conditioner at the roots of my hair because if I use less (the same number of pump as shampoo), I start to have a lot of split ends. But overall, this is a good product."
3,Its okay...not thrilled,"The shampoo has a lovely lemon scent and works great. The conditioner is a waste of money. It's consistency is about that of any over the counter conditioner you can buy and I have to use just as much as those low end conditioners. Others have claimed to see less hair loss, I haven't noticed that at all."
1,IDEALOGICAL AXE GRINDING,"Friedman is a dishonest reporter. His hatred of Israel and of Jews who support her is apparent on every page. He sees the late Rabbi Kahane as a threat to his point of view. In his effort to discredit him by repeating unsubstantiated stories, he exposes his own axe to grind.This book reads like an F term paper in a college course. No self-respecting professor would accept such work. It's obvious that the publisher agrees with Friedman's assertions otherwise this radical leftist pamphlet would have been thrown on a scrap heap.The only reason why I graded this a one-star book is because we are not allowed to rate zero stars or negative number stars."
3,At least its about Kahane,"Kahane deserves a biography, and however biased this one may be at least its a biography. The author documents the entire life of Kahane, however not including his asssasination. Kahane was born to a Rabbinic family and entered the Rabbinate, however he found his calling in politics. He embraced the cause of Jewish self defense, leading the JDL and coining the phrase ""every Jew a .22"". He went on to fight the Soviet suppression of Jews and then did Aliyah to Israel where he quickly became infamous for his ideas and speeches regarding the demographic problem and his calls in ""They Must Go"" for a volunary expulsion of Arabs. His opponents, like the author of this book, saw him as a dangerous nationalist Jewish fascist and likewise Jewish intellectuals such as Dershowitz rejected his ideas.Seth J. Frantzman"
1,"If you want a book full of blatant errors, buy this one!","First of all, this book has an incredible amount of errors, even considering that it is a first edition. The author rushes topics so the reader could not possibly understand it to the extent that he or she is expected in order to do the problems offered at the end of each section. An inordinate amount of understanding is expected of the target audience of this book, thus diminishing the value of the information given. It is truly below the average quality level expected of books teaching this subject."
5,POWERFUL AND ENTERTAINING,"""Sales Dragon"" is a powerful and entertaining collection of thoughts, self-talk, ideas, and quotes that can make a dramatic difference in your life, your sales volume, and your career. From Virtue Shifting to the Tao of Sales Abundance, you will be encouraged, enlightened, and empowered.- Steve Simms, Author of ""Mindrobics: How To Be Happy For The Rest Of Your Life."
2,Good bathroom reading,"I actually fell for the hype that is on this page. The previous reviewer figured out something I hadn't seen.There must be some pithy eastern sounding saying that has to do with ""Sales Honesty"".The book is actually excellent restroom reading and can be mildly motivational. But an entire book of eastern sayings with the word ""Sales"" interspersed in them doesn't count for 5 stars."
5,FULL OF QUOTES ANY SALES MANAGER WOULD LOVE.,"The affirmations alone at the end of each chapter will be a wonderful tool for any salesperson! Using animals is a masterful way to help the salesperson visualize their role in a sales situation! This book is also full of quotes any sales manager would love.- David L. Hicks, President of Success Motivation (R) Institut"
1,fishy reviews...,"I agree with one of the reviewers. Be careful with these reviews...So many 5 start reviews for this book came from the anonymous ""A Viewer"". They smell funny."
1,Where are the track listings?,"I probably would have purchased this product EXCEPT there are NO TRACK LISTINGS to ensure that I would like to own this product & with 12 sellers, there is NO EXCUSE why listing is not available!!!! For this reason I rated it a 1."
4,"Andsnes wonderful, Bostridge another matter","I have only listened to the album partially, but I found myself aggravated by Bostridge's performance to the point where I had to give vent to my frustration. First Andsnes: I have heard several of his recordings of Schubert and all are remarkable, I would even say revelatory. The sound quality and tonal character of his playing, helped by a great recording and, I assume, an extremely fine piano, add to the effect. But Bostridge's over-emoting and affectation has reached the point where it has become annoying. That said, I would add that Andsnes's accompaniments are as worth hearing as his solo work. I would recommend any Schubert by Andsnes on the basis of the several recordings I have, and if one has to put up with Bostridge, well - it's not a perfect world."
1,Mastery of What?,"This book claims to teach mastery of awareness but does little more than tell you to ""watch yourself"" and write things down. It lacks any specific stalking techniques and gives very little help of any kind that would lead to ""mastery."" The ""stalking"" relies solely on you remembering to notice yourself, which is about the same as you might do while you're in therapy, a discussion group, or making use of any particular vehicle that entrains your attention a bit more to your daily thoughts/feelings/reactions.I don't see how anyone could give this book five stars.The style is simplistic and boring and the exercises strictly beginnerish. If you're the kind of person who has had NO awareness of yourself whatsoever in your entire life, or if you are 12-14 years old, this book might help you. But there are still many better books than this. I'd recommend spending your money on mastering awareness of a nice meal instead."
1,bad sizing,"The size listed is wrong. the pad is not 52x32. the pad is 34x32. I bougth it to fit a full size bed, it doesn't."
5,This is good for bedwetters,"My son is a prolific peeer! Seriously. We've tried everything from limiting liquids to going potty mere moments before bed. Nothing helps. Thank god for this product. Other ""piddle pads,"" as we call them move around when he sleeps, but this one stays in place. I haven't had any problems with the wetness soaking through to bed."
1,BUYER BEWARE! This is not a real greatest hits!,"This album contains mediocre (recent) re-recordings of some of the bands hits! Don't waste your money and don't reward the record company for misleading you with a title like the ""Very Best of..."" The Time Life series contains the original ""96 Tears"" if that's what you're after."
