2,Disappointment,"I bought this book because it was featured on Oprah.com. It is a let-down. Sure, the book focuses on how marriages go through ups and downs, but it becomes tiresome, what with the repetition on the same problems, and the idealistic reconciliation that seems forged, or at least exaggerated for the sake of selling more books perhaps.Actually, every marriage goes through bad patches. The bottom line is to rise above everything and focus on the good stuff that make you love each other in the first place. I personally find it hard to believe that the wife forgave the husband so readily the two times he cheated on her. What about feelings of mistrust, bitterness before hitting forgiveness?"
5,Nothing less than amazing!,WTF! This was the best product I've ever bought!I'm a fan of Sublime and I can't describe the felling of having something like it on my hands!
5,Perfection,"This is an amazing box set, and well worth the price tag. It's great to hear all of the songs I enjoyed on bootlegs totally remastered, it's like they're brand new again. Only disappointment was the censoring of the song ""89 Vision"". The original bootleg had a lot more lyrics that they took out of this one for some reason. Other than that, I don't have any complaints. And would reccomend this to any Sublime fan out there (just make sure to download the REAL version of 89 Vision)"
2,Great Boxset - But order was wrong/incomplete,"Like I stated above. My problem is not with the boxset itself, but with that fact that Amazon sent it to me with 2 copies of disc 1 and no disc 2...I thought it was new?? What is up with that. I got it for my g/f for Christmas and now I can't return it."
3,Wish Amazon sell the ones made in Asia,"I'm originally from one of the SE Asian countries. I and my siblings grew up with this. So, I'd like to give this for my kids, too. Too bad these ones doesn't taste as good as the ones from my country. These ones smell and taste so fishy! I'm not going to buy this again.."
1,Undrinkable!,"I was planning to give this to my boy (4 1/2) but the taste of it is so bad, I almost vomited; I can't give this to my kid, he will hate me the rest of his life!you are wasting your money!"
2,Not impressed,"Out of the 4 batteries, 2 became pretty useless after a few dozen recharges. I use them in a digital camera, and they last only a few shots. The other two still last for maybe 50 shots (mostly w/o flash), but even that's not good enough. Time to try another brand..."
4,Four out of five...,"When I received this magnificent product, I found out that it was indeed a book. Moreover, I understand that it was indeed written by David Mumford. Upon opening it, I saw that it discusses varieties, and also that it discusses schemes.However, the book fails to be as advertised in one key aspect: it is not red."
5,So cute!!!,The colors are so vibrant and the patch itself feels sturdy. It attached rapidly to the backpack. Its very much worthy. 3 x 3 inches aprox.
4,Nintendo Patch,"Just as the description says, this patch measures 3 inches. It is good quality and has clean details. What you see is what you get."
4,The magic of the Magic Wood,"A chillingly charming book that hold the possibility of mystery for children and adults. The book is a dare of sorts, a temptation both visual and metaphoric. It alludes to danger and salvation, to curiosity and fear, to wonder and to faith. Be aware - it may scare your children - but it may delight them. My three year old laughs out loud, and chants the rhythmic refrain with me as I read. It is a mysterious poem, with beautiful illustration."
5,Perfection!,My durable Brother label maker still works perfectly. Thanks to these replacement tapes we remain in business making just the kind of labels we need with true perfection.
2,"pure flattery, disappointing",really a loving tribute to a person who was a lot more complicated than this doc would want you to believe. really sands down some rough edges to the performer.
2,The Plasmatics and Wendy O. Williams: 10 Year of Revolutionary Rock and Roll,I was also really excited about this DVD. I bought a homemade fan VHS online that has much better footage with the whole band including Stotts. My husband and I were also wondering where the rest of the band is...it seemed to us too like they tried to edit out Stotts! This is a travesty!!! I found that this also leaned more on her metalish days which I really didn't like. I too think that was when she went downhill and I lost interest in her. Too bad! I will try to find that other video that someone mentioned.
1,"No Stotts, What A Joke!","After looking forward to the release of this dvd, I was as bitterly disappointed as most of the reviewers here. To slam Richie Stotts and not accord him the respect he deserves is the equivalent of the surviving members of Queen slamming Freddie Mercury for his falsetto. Unthinkable! Yet, it happens on this dvd. Worse, the ""producers"" go out of their way to cut him out of every piece of video footage on the dvd. Yet, they also have the nerve to use his music throughout the dvd. Most appalling is editing Stotts out of the video for The Damned and calling it a ""director's cut"" Who are these people kidding? It gets one star for some good footage and the memories, but there is an alternative, there is a dvd called ""Chainsaws, Shotguns and Rock and Roll"" It is hard to find ( I got my copy on Ebay) but it is a great collection and a fitting tribute to the Plasmatics. As far as this dvd is concerned the Plasmatics and Wendy deserved better!"
5,Great Storage at a Great Price,"I'm a quilter and seamstress, and I use these boxes for projects and fabrics. They are great - lightweight, see-through, stackable, and affordable. The manufacturer has great customer service, too. When I lost a latch, they sent replacements at no charge. These boxes have really cleaned up my tiny sewing area and made it easier for me to find what I'm looking for, while keeping everything clean and dust-free."
4,Worth the money,"I own this boardcutter and I use need to cut foam boards and the like quite frequently so it comes in handy. The benefit to having this board cutter over using a regular X-acto knife is that it is more steady; it has a rubbery, soft handle which your palm easily hugs; dual blades (one is removable); tightening screw to ensure the blade doesn't change its position; varying depths of cutting. It can be used for 90* angle cuts or 45* angle cuts by repositioning the bottom plastic attachment.The only downside is that it doesn't have any particular mechanism that helps you cut a straight line, so I often have to use a metal ruler as my guideline."
1,VERY POOR REPAIR SERVICE,"This may be a very good recorder, unfortunatly the one I received is defective. These things happen the problem is with the warranty service.The company providing the service requires the item to be returned to them for repair and it takes 4 to 6 weeks before you can expect it back.Most companies will replace the product with a new one if returned within 90 days, not this one. Good luck hope you get one that works."
2,Won't play its recorded DVDs on other recorders,"Works okay most of the time. Occasionally, for no apparent reason, a disc will not record (even though same disc has previously recorded just fine). Then you will need to try another. Unfortunately you are not likely to discover this until the next day after an event which was programmed with the timer. It is also finnicky about which discs it will record. Usually I can use Sony 1x-2x DVD-RW discs but it was all experimenting to discover which ones would work.Also, discs recorded on this player do not play on other DVD players. I was careful to record at speeds recommended in the instruction manual and made sure to finalize the disc, but still the discs will not play in computers or other players. Not a problem if you have no plans to play them in other players."
4,Excellent read for putting things in perspective,"A thoroughly enjoyable book. Excellent for someone who has basic knowledge of international and human rights law and who wishes to see things from a different perspective.As a law student I found this book to be pleasantly refreshing when compared with the usual mind-numbing textbooks on international law. There are only two relatively negative things I can say about this book. Having read through this book a couple of times I found that it feels somewhat rushed, and also there is a tendency to make sweeping statements in places.Yet overall I loved this book from page one and it really is easy to read yet makes you think. Highly recommended for anyone who wishes to know more about the practical side of international and human rights law, and also specifically for law students, because this is a book that tells you some things that are not even mentioned in your law course. I particularly loved Geoffrey's dry humour which pervades this book."
4,Lengthy but worth the effort,"At 609 pages this is a lengthy read on a difficult subject; Robertson deals with it logically and often with charm and wit (perhaps a useful coping mechanism for such a depressing subject). We clearly have a long way to go to achieve a more humane world. Robertson traces the history of the concept of crimes against humanity from the trial of Charles I in 1649 and the landmark work of Grotius, in particular focusing on developments post Nuremberg, to the present day (2006). Obviously the Bush administration cops a bit of a flogging on its more recent demurring as a human rights leader but it is pleasing to see the people of America reaffirming their common decency and insisting the US resume this role. Robertson's book will help us all think more clearly on this complex subject and make the world a better place."
4,Crimes Against Humanity,"Its a solid read with many interesting cases and examples. I bought this book to compete in a high school debate, it was though thoroughly enjoyable for me to read. I gave it a 4 rating because although it was interesting and thought provoking it seem, at many time, as if I was reading a history lesson.If you need to brush up on your crimes and international law this is the book for you."
1,Confusing,"This was the most confusing product that I've ever bought in my life. I came with absolutely no instructions, not even a picture. I had to pull up the picture on my PC to get an idea of what it was suppose to look like. Then, as we were putting it together, the little hook holders broke and it is held together with metal twist ties. I'm glad my little parrotlet likes this cage, because it really is a confusing piece of junk. I would never buy another from this company."
4,ok,Not as nice as the ones that were discontinued by another manufacturer but does the job - i like that i can put the dvd/cd in another case for transport and it still fits in the sleeve
5,Henry Miller - lifenotes,"This is a very short read but so intriguing that you will lust for the last few words so you may complete the mission. Henry Miller nurtures a childhood fantasy of becoming a clown and uses this vehicle to convey a perspective on life that you will find invaluable. Though short and full of entertaining imagery, the complexity and the symbolism (along with the epilogue) will blow your mind. Godspeed, Mr. Miller!"
2,clownesk kitsch,"Bought this book in an earlier print at antiquarian book fair. Beautiful design by Merle Armitage, reminding of Black Sparrow Pressbooks from the 80ties.Still this dates back to the late 40ties. Stripes like Daniel Buren. Color circles at the beginning and end of the story. Strange fairytale like short story which could be experiienced as kitsch. I don't know really. With nicely reproduced monochrome clownesk pictures by Picasso, Segonzac, Klee, Rouault etc most from the designers private (!) collection."
4,Great old magazine about Arizona,"I needed some information for a short story I'm writing set in 1956 Flagstaff. Would you believe I found just what I was looking for in a July, 1956 Arizona Highways magazine? The article on Navajo art was so interesting and I loved looking at the paintings, so fine and so unexpected. For it's age, the magazine was in surprisingly good condition, and I'll treasure it long after the short story is completed and (with a little luck and good writing) sold."
3,3 stars is ALL this book deserves sorry....you gotta come harder,"The characters in this book had so much potential in terms of how each story could have been developed. The book lacked depth. The storylines are watered down at best. For instance, Jewel she's spoiled, has money mangement issues yada yada...then comes along Kevin...next thing ya know their walking down the aisle.....DID I MISS SOMETHING??? I just finished this book last night when I read the last sentence I flipped the page thinking it would continue....but it didn't. Of course were some good moments, but I was very disappointed. I had high hopes."
4,The Just Between Sisters Book Club Review,"Our book club was privileged enough to have this wonderful author speak with us during her visit home to NJ recently. This book is filled with both her insight as a black woman in the law profession as well as what it means to have a strong spiritual foundation. The book was inspirational, funny and very realistic. Our club truly enjoyed the book and could indentify with many, if not all, of the woman characters. We were pleased to see that the male characters were equally as well-portrayed and not at all intimidated by these powerful sisters and their comraderie. We highly recommend this book and on our club's scale of 1 to 4, we gave it a 4. Good luck, Sister Jarrett on all of your future endeavors and remember the next time that you are home...look us up ! Much love.....JBS"
4,Refreshing,"I thought this was a refreshing change from the typical sister/friend and girl meets boy books. I loved how the author incorporated spiritually and real life situations in the story. I thought the characters were very real and I could easily relate to them, especially Lexi. The characters were fun, one could feel they knew each of the girls. For a first time author, Norma did a wonderful job."
3,Benzyl Alcohol,"This wasn't bad tasting stuff, and it served my purpose. I'd rather ""drink"" MSM than take the capsules.However ...I was just about to order some more, when I saw ""benzyl alcohol"" listed as ""other ingredients"".So! This is NOT ""pure"" MSM.The liquid form contains deionized water AND benzyl alcohol.Benzyl alcohol is a neurotoxin -- whatever THAT is.Thus, it loses 2 stars.I won't be taking this in liquid form anymore."
5,16 oz size,"I love this product - I really prefer the liquid to the pills.But has anyone else noticed that there are two different 16 oz size options for this product, and that one of them is $12.55 and the other is $20.60? Is there any difference between the two?"
5,A Fine Book,"I love this book, and have given it to several friends and family. My one suggestion is that the cover be revised, because it looks like a kid's book, and if ever you need to ""sleep with bread"" it's when you are an adult and have your own kids. The suggestions are helpful, and the stories are engaging."
5,Wonderful resource,"We use Sleeping with Bread as a basic resource to help parents and children build a habit of reviewing each day together, growing in awareness of God's continuing presence and action in daily life. Powerful. Our Jesuit priests in the parish also use it with adults in Ignatian prayer. Excellent on all fronts."
5,Sleeping with Bread: Holding What Gives You Life,This is an excellent little book. Simple in its format and profound in content. The Lynn's give contemporary context to the Daily Examin of St. Ignatius Loyola. What is most helpful is the emphasis on knowing in one's spirit how much God wants us to be fulfilled.
3,Didn't expect the authors to disagree with Church teaching,I really enjoyed the book but was surprised to come to a section where the authors state that they disagree with Church teaching re. contraception - I tend to assume that if you are making your living from 'the Church' that you should stick with the teachings or maybe find a different career.
5,My favorite singer,I am a Russell Watson fan and this is not really a review. I just want to rate this album 5 Stars because of the awful people who are so unjustly critical of his album. He is my favorite singer and this is my favorite album.
5,"Don't trust us reviewers, just go out and listen to Watson","I too don't believe in media hype or reviews, positive or negative, and went out and listened to some tracks of this CD. I fell in love with Watson's voice immediately. More surprising was his ability to sing pop and classical songs in pop and classical voices. I bought this CD and listen to it non-stop. Listeners, don't just believe us reviewers but listen to Watson and see for yourselves."
4,Refreshing,"I disagree with the opera fan who was so critical of Russell Watson's voice and performance. I think he will one day be a big star in his own right. His voice is youthful and refreshing. He obviously had natural vocal gift at the time when he walked in to Decca Records, because Decca Records recognized it and signed him on the spot. Furthermore, several of the most famous and respected operatic stars of today thought enough of Mr. Watson's talent to include him as a performer in a CD showcasing their combined talents. I think Mr. ""fan"" should give Russell Watson the due he so richly deserves."
5,You will Love this!!,"I'm 19 years old and loves all different kinds of music including this wonderful CD by Russell Watson. The music is so powerful and amazing!! I love it!! I got it as a gift from my grandfather. At first, I thought ""weird. who is this guy??"" It's my favorite CD now. All the tracks are special but I especially like #1, and #5. You won't regret buying this CD!!"
5,Refreshing!,"I stumbled onto Russell Watson while clicking around and heard his voice on PBS. It caught my attention immediately. After running out to buy the CD the very next day, I just can't stop listening to it. I especially love the duet with Cleopatra Higgins in ""Someone like you"". I look forward to his next CD."
4,"Indeed, the voice","This young man has an astounding voice and should not cheapen it with pop music, at least on one CD. I would like to hear more operatic arias or classical numbers. Pop music is fine in its place, but I for one do not want to sit through it just to get the good stuff!!! I am rating it at 4 stars simply because almost anyone can sing a pop tune, but truly great tenors are few and far between."
1,A singer without much voice,"Russell Watson is a singer who has over-reached himself by attempting songs which is clearly beyond his abilities. In fact, Mr Watson is more or less a singer without a voice - his performances are electronically enhanced, which gives a misleading impression of the size and capabilities of the singer.An artistically dishonest recording."
1,Bad debut,Can't imagine a worse debut that Russell Watson did on this album. None of the tracks are well sung. Some of Watson's interpretations are indeed perverse and vocally gross!Terrible way to start a career with!
1,Not good,I don't think this is at all good. The singer's voice is ordinary and he fails to invest his singing with much feeling. Bored by this recording.
1,Singing!! Is that what they are calling this these days,"This is undoubtedly one of the most hideous excuses for singing I have heard of in years. I thought Bocelli was bad, but this kid makes him look like a truly gifted individual. They need to take this mess out of the realms of classical music and give it its' own genre: Schlock. We have become so uneducated about beauty and singing, that we no longer are able to discern either, but only follow like the rats did with the Pied Piper when someone puts something out there for us to hear. There are truly gifted singers in this world who go unheard because they don't have a gimmick. i sang better than this kid when i was 12."
1,A disappointing debut,"What a disappointing debut this is. Russell Watson, contrary to all the hype, doesn't have a beautiful and powerful voice. In fact, his voice sounds really under-nourished. And his performances are so bland and uncommunicative! What a let down!"
5,He is the VOICE,"I can understand why this album is called 'the Voice' as the voice of Russell Watson is has color and charm. His singing technique is such that he can deliver any kind of music properly. A brilliant CD, both for the singer and his fans."
4,This is a good intro to Opera,"I bought this CD on the strength of one song - Where My HEart Will Take Me (Theme from Enterprise) - and I am happy that I did buy it. The voice is an appropriate title for this CD. I wouldn't normally listen to anything to do with Opera, but the ease in which Russell Watson moves from classical Opera to more modern day contemporary music is good.My only complaint about the whole CD (and the reason it only gets 4 stars from me) is the god awful version of the Freddie Mercury/Monserat Cabelle hit Barcelona. Some things should be left alone to stand on their own merits rather than be butchered by slack production."
5,Unmatched voice,"I am a big fan of Russell Watson. His multi-talented voice is unmatched. When most opera singers sing pop songs, they sound like an opera singer singing pop songs! Not so with Russell Watson! He can sing with skill and emotion on any level. His classical voice has depth, clarity and is just as powerful as all of the famous tenors of today, contrary to what the critics have been saying. The cross-over singers have the same voice singing pop or opera. Not so with Russell Watson! This is an inspiring CD. I love it."
5,Love It!!!,"A girlfriend gave me ""The Voice"" for birthday present. I have never liked 'opera' but after listening to Russell Watson I am converted. I have since purchased Encore and Va pensiero gives me shivers. Actually most of his songs give me shivers. I enjoy his change from pop to opera on both c.d.s.Highly recommended, play it loud when you are in the car or home alone...Fantastic..."
1,Signor Watson un cantante non e (Mr. Watson is not a singer),"He's a welder. And he should've stayed one. Alot of people who hate opera like this CD, but this doesn't mean Watson is 'bridging the gap' between classical and modern, it just means he's destroying everything about opera those people hate - it's grandeur, it's complexity, it's beauty. Don't buy this CD unless you hate opera and want it to die screaming."
4,Wonderful,"I think Russell has an amazing voice for his age. He is clearly a prodigy who can go on to become the top of his class. The only problem I have with this album is that I don't think Russell is pushing himself as far as he can go with his vocal abilities. I keep waiting for that powerful voice to blow me away and it never comes even though I know it can. My advice for Russell would be to associate himself with other mega voices in the business such as Barbra Streisand, Celine Dion, Lara Fabian, Martina McBride, and Linda Eder. These are people who are gifted with titanic voices and know how to use them to their maximum potential. If Russell gets in with this crowd he will be singing to packed audiences until he's an old man."
4,The Voice,"Russell is incredible on the operatic material, but I was disappointed to find pop songs, which I hate, on the CD. However, even skipping those leaves one with some great material. If he would just stick to opera....anyone can sing pop, but it takes a special voice (which Russell has) to sing opera."
4,The 'Voice' is real.........,"There is no question this young man has an absolutely outstanding gift! Why did I rate it a 4 instead of 5. For the same reason some champion figure skating is off a little. The music doesn't match the rest of the performance. A top talent needs little or no music to perform. Too much sound modifying and background, otherwise his voice is remarkable, thank god he has not gone pop or hip hop or whatever you call that junk."
3,Disappointing,"For all the hype and hooplah, maybe I expected too much. Had I taken the time to sample more of the songs on iTunes or somewhere else, I probably would not have bought the CD."
1,uninteresting,"I disagree with those who claim that Russell Watson sings every type of song with ease. Just listen to the final cadenza of 'La donna e mobile' where the Watson just tumbles down the stairs. I won't be surprised if those who fail to pick this up (or would not acknowledge it) would praise Watson to the skies. But I do hope that people can be more objective in reviewing this cd rather than praising it just because it is sung by the man they happen to like, whatever the reason.I have borrowed this cd from a friend, and both of us are of the same view: The singing here is pretty wretched and uninteresting."
1,Where's the voice?,"As this cd is titled ""The Voice"", I expected a great voice on display. But where's the voice? I can't even find decent whining in here. Ghastly singing throughout!"
5,Wow,I don't listen to classical music (until now). I am wearing this CD out - it is awesome. We have 3 copies in my house (everyone wanted one of their own).
1,give me a break,"This is the biggest slap in the face to any opera singer I have ever heard. This man sounds simply awful. Anyone can listen to Russel Watson and then listen to any ""working"" opera singer and hear a difference.That difference would be known as a ""technique"", and a common knowlege of the language in which one is singing. This is a disgusting trend in the ""classical"" music industry that just makes me sick. Take any bozo off the street and throw him in front of a mike, and there you have it....the next caruso?? I don't think so. Shame on this record company...shame."
1,Nothing special,"Frankly, there's nothing very special in this CD. The singing here is just of karaoke quality - the voice itself is of unremarkable quality, there are transpositions and simplifications when the singer cannot handle the music, lots of artificial amplification and addition of intrusive resonance, poor voice-to-orchestral balance etc.. In fact, many ordinary people can sing much better than Russell Watson at the karaoke box. I regret having spent the full price of a CD to get something that is so ordinary and can be found everywhere in town."
1,Lacking in heart and soul,Russell Watson's singing on this album lacks heart and soul. It leaves me cold. It is also technically defective and he sounds comical in some of the more embarrassing corners.I also don't like the choice of songs - they are unimaginative and most are far too taxing for Russell Watson's slender and poorly developed voice.That this album has proved to be rather good-selling cannot cover up the fact that this album is an artistic disaster.
1,A voiceless singer,"I can't see how Russell Watson and his record company can market this album and its predecessor by virtue of the singer's voice, for it is obvious from the recordings that Watson is quite a voiceless singer.Not only is his voice rather unpleasant, his vocal technique is extremely deficient. As a result, he resorts to all kinds of simplifications, making his accounts mere travesties of classical singer.None of the tracks on this album is appealing. At times, the singing is such that it is even disgusting from a musical point of view.I don't like this CD at all."
1,Singer in dire straits,"I don't care about the singing style. But if the singer cannot sustain or reach the notes, it is clear that he is in vocal dire straits and should not attempt the songs. It is not an enjoyable experience having to listen to a new singer in obvious vocal distress. It is not an honorable thing for record companies to release such recordings for public consumption, too. I found all the hype surrounding this new singer to be misleading. And having been misled, I must voice my complaints!"
2,Where's the voice?,"I, too, stumbled across Russell Watson on PBS while channel surfing one dark and stormy night. I was mesmerized. So, I searched for and purchased his CD. The CD ought to be titled, ""The Orchestra"". It's as though no one trusted The Voice to carry the production. Instead the overwrought production is constantly scribbling all over the vocals. I have been amazed in the past by Ennio Morricone's composing but in this case it is in direct conflict with and constantly obscuring the voice. The voice is simply not showcased, the orchestra and composer are. I hope that the next CD uses the orchestra to support and enhance the singer rather than to drown him out."
1,Doesn't make the grade,"Frankly, this cd is one of the worst that I've heard. It simply doesn't make the grade, no matter from what perspective one views it. Clearly, some of those who are praising this cd to the skies haven't listened to many recordings. If they have, they'll realise that Russell Watson's voice and singing technique both leave much to be desired.It is also laughable for people to suggest that Russell Watson is good looking. I'm afraid that, for these people, the only tenors that they've heard of are the close-to-retirement Pavarotti, Domingo and Carreras, people who began their careers 40 years ago. They certainly don't know that there're many young operatic singers nowdays who are much more handsome and good-looking than Russell Watson. Yes, Russell Watson doesn't even make the grade in terms of appearance.But of course, looks are not relevant when appraising a sound recording. I'm giving this cd 1 star for the singing of Russell Watson."
4,Very enjoyable for non-opera snubs!,"I came across this CD and had never heard of Russell Watson. I gave a listen to it and was instantly impressed with this young guy's gift. I am no big opera critic, but I like this CD and would highly recommend it to anyone wanting to try opera. We will all be hearing more from Russell Watson in the future!"
5,A New Opera Lover!,"My first introduction to Russell was at his debut in the USA on Good Morning America. I was in town and had tickets for the show but didn't know who was going to be on. As we were waiting to go in, I heard this amazing ""voice"". I was sure that it was an older gentleman until we saw Russell! It's no wonder they call his album ""The Voice"" - he was amazing! He was a real charmer, autographing photos and chatting with the crowd. I immediately went out and bought his CD. I love it because it has a mix of pop and opera and he can sing both so well - even wihtin the same song! And he's cute too! Amazing! He's going to be a HUGE star!"
4,enjoyable cd,"I wonder if any of those people who trashed this cd are just plain pretentious snobs who are not open-minded to new young talents. I personally think his voice is great; much better than Andrea Bocelli's (go ahead and compare the songs they both covered). His selection of songs does not win me over, but there are a few exceptional choices. Give the cd a fair chance, just because he is not classically trained doesn't mean he's not good."
5,THE PEOPLE'S TENOR,"I bought this CD based only on the advertisement. What luck, I say... I am by no means an opera expert. I do enjoy it and I have all the Three Tenors stuff, but Russell Watson is amazing at his craft. The CD is call.. THE VOICE, and I can see why. The songs offered here is opera with a twist. Nessun Dorma and Amor Ti Vieta is outstanding. Opera lovers all over the world are looking for the next great tenor. Jose Cura and Marcella Alvarez made good showings in this area, but RW makes a very good showing here for that position. You experts out there want be disappointed; just as the casual listener. Go out and get this one you may be surprised at sound that RW projects. I look forward to the CD that he devotes totally to ARIAS.I still consider myself new to opera and again you will enjoy. I also recommend Piano Adagios and Violin Adagios for all your quiet times.Tripp"
1,Listen first,"After reading the mostly positive reviews here, I decided to give this CD a try. Imagine my disappointment after I put on this CD only to find myself being assaulted by a raspy voice, technically disastrous singing and poor musicianship! None of my family members like it, and they accuse me of wasting my money on such trashy singing.I'd urge people to use their ears and try the CD out in record stores before buying it, Many of the good reviews are, in my opinion, misleading. Or borrow one from you friend to have a try first before dipping into your pocket. Or else, you may regret your rash decision, as I do."
1,....HUH?.....,"I really think that Russell Watson is getting a little bit too much credit than he deserves...I personally feel that this CD is a pre-mature, unfortunate offspring of a short-lived hype. While he is backed by a touching story of his rise to the public eye, his voice is not the quality that I expect from an album what has such a title as ""THE VOICE"". He does have a pretty voice, but it's not the kind of voice that fits such arias as ""Amor ti vieta"" or ""Nessun dorma""...both songs send chills down spines and cause goosebumps because it is well written music. Mr Watson will probably do well in crossover repertoire.. along with Sarah Brightman maybe, but in terms of being the new phenomenal tenor, he probably needs to allow his voice to mature some more, and in the meantime, listen to Pav, or Domingo, Carreras, Bjoerling, Gedda, or Wunderlich..just to see how it's really done.. In short, don't buy this CD."
4,Voicing about the Voice!,Russell I am knocking off one star for your feeble attempt at Barcelona. Russell please don't try to be Freddie Mercury again. Nobody can ever take his place or do justice to his music. Otherwise I loved this CD and am recommending it for background music at my daughter's wedding.
5,Great Singer,"Russell Watson should have a great career ahead of him. Even though he does not have the full, rich voice of Bocelli, Pavarotti, etc, he still has some very interesting phrasing. One can detect his deeply passionate nature by the choice of his selections. Despite the criticism he's been receiving, I think he has a pleasant voice with moving delivery. He is at home with a broad range of musical selections. I am looking forward to his next release."
5,One-of-a-kind Talent,"It's clear you either like Watson or you don't. I am a great fan of Barbra Streisand but my spouse, children and their spouses can't stand her. Watson, it seems, has the same kind of devout fans and enemies so he perhaps has the makings of being a tremendous star as Streisand.Watson does remind me of the 50's musical, movie star, Mario Lanza, belting out operatic songs at the top of his voice, but with a much warmer personality and musical versatility.This album is definitely for music fans who appreciate a mix of classical music with a bit of rock and pop thrown in. Critics will never appreciate Watson, so for those who are being introduced him for the first time, just sit back, relax and listen to this unbelievable one-of-a-kind talent."
1,Severely substandard,"This cd is severely substandard. The singing, the interpretation, the music arrangement and the acoustics are all unbelievably bad! It's unthinkable that the record company has passed it for release."
5,Addictive!,"In order for me to be completely content, Russell has to be singing. His voice is supreme and there is no struggle to hitthe high notes. People who have not heard him sing have a big vacumm in their lives. I actually came on line to buy another of his recordings but ..."
1,A voiceless singing,"I'm wondering what ""voice"" the advertisements are trumpeting in connexion with this cd. As I can see and hear, there's no voice at all that is of any exceptional quality. Instead, I find a weak and poorly trained voice barely survively in some rather demanding music. I suppose that this recording is intended as a vocal joke, but as a serious album of singing, this simply cannot do."
1,What voice?,"Where is the voice mentioned on the cd cover? I certainly don't hear any voice of any quality. Instead, I've been treated to an hour of screaming on this cd. The performances of Russell Watson are unacceptably bad. Not recommended."
1,Don't believe the hype-- Watson: The voice that wasn't.,"I'd been resisting purchasing The Voice for several months (mostly because I don't like to jump on bandwagons or buy music advertised during morning television), but then I caved and bought it used. What a huge disappointment. As a classical/opera listener, I found Watson's voice to be weak and uninspiring. He takes top prize for the worst male vocalist I've heard to date. I tend to go for voices that make the hairs on the back of my neck bristle... if you like that electricity too, avoid Watson like the plague."
1,Deserves a Zero,"This maybe shouting, belting or screaming. But this definitely is NOT singing! With an ugly voice and an immature technique, the performances in this recording are of deplorable standard. Definitely not fit for consumption! I'd have awarded it with ZERO star had it been possible."
1,A singer with no voice,"The title of this album is deeply ironical, for the singer has little voice! His narrow range and unformed technique are both an embarrassment. Naturally, he fails to do justice to the music. A one-star recording."
2,Hype and publicity do not a musician make,"Although Watson's aim of bringing opera to the masses is a worthy cause,the fact remains that 'the Voice' is disappointing. Watson has never had formal training and it shows. His voice is often reedy, lacking the smooth velvet of the likes of Safina, Bocelli and even Groban. Some sustained notes feel strained and jumps from low to high often feel choppy and lack smoothness. A good collection of songs but somewhat poorly sung. The work of a karaoke amatuer, one would do better with the wonderful Alessandro Safina."
4,Almost there,"I just finished playing my newly purchased copy of this album, and here's what I have to say about it: a lot of the selections are surprisingly good, if not great, and Russell can shamelessly slide from one selection to the next without missing a beat. He has a nice (if occasionally strong) voice, sporty enough to ease on down the road with Andrea Bocelli, Emma Shapplin, or Sarah Brightman. Only ""Pelagia's Song"" sounds a bit blah-ish (no offense to Russell), but songs like ""Nella Fantasia,"" ""Nessun Dorma,"" ""Someone Like You,"" ""Bridge Over Troubled Water"" and the best song on the CD, ""Barcelona"" (with Shaun Ryder), make up for that one little mistake.Nice try overall, Russell; you're almost there. I'm sure your next album will be better, but for now there's little wrong with this."
2,"So much hype, but....","Mr Watson sings with a pleasant tone for the most part, yet he does very little with the words. This is some understandable in the case of people singing in a language they don't speak, but what about the songs sung in English? I'd hate to say this, but this another attempt at launching a pop tenor, a Bocelli II, but Mr Watson has a long way to go, before recording his first aria recital."
5,How did I manage to miss this?,"Up until I was given the C.D. ""ENCORE"" I had never heard of RUSSELL WATSON, after listening to it I thought what had I been missing, so I bought ""THE VOICE"" C.D. WOW !! what a voice. NELLA FANTASIA ,MISEREREand CARUSO are so full of emotion, BRIDGE OVER TROUBLED WATER is the best version I have ever heard. VIENNA and BARCELONA are brilliant and contrast with the soothing SAYON DOLA. NESSUN DORMA makes me tingle all over...When RUSSELL hit the top notes I was stunned, I could not believe what I was hearing, so I listened again and again and still am 2 years on.The tapes I have of Domingo and Pavarotti singing NESSUN DORMA have been put away RUSSELL surpasses them all. ""THE VOICE "" is amazing and he truly deserves this title. Sandy."
5,Russell is the greatest,"If you don't have this incredible cd in your Russell collection, you are missing a rare gem! every track is a winner. i have played this cd non stop since i got it! get it put in the player and hang on. Russell is the greatest!"
1,No match for the best,"It is unfair to assess Russell Watson's singing by the standard of those classical singers as he isn't one.But when one assess him and his work by the standard of cross-over, he still is not that competitive. Consider the likes of Bocelli, Safina and Groban. ALl of them boast better voices, a more secure technique, more musicianship and musical intelligence than Russell Watson.With so much to choose from in the market, Russell Watson's album is frankly does not provide value for money as there're much better choices available."
1,Horrible!!,Please just compare Bocelli's and Watson's rendition of Misere!! Bocelli's voice is warm and Italian whereas Watson just sounds tinny in comparison. This must be some kind of joke--I think he should stick to pop music in English and not be recording all of Bocelli's repertoire from Romanza. Then maybe he would be able to record a pleasant CD. He also should not be recording opera--an untrained voice cannot do that music justice.This cd is a very unfortunate choice of repertoire.
3,Elevator Music.....,"Russell Watson may have a wonderful voice, but his accompaniments are reminiscent of elevator music! The flowing strings may be sutiable for one song, but not the whole album? Russell will put all his fans to sleep! For example compare his and Bocelli's ""Caruso."" While Bocelli's version is poignant and enigmatic, suggestive of the lyrics, Russell's arrangment sounds identical to every other song on his CD."
5,Russell Watson--The Voice**EXCELLENT**,"I love Opera and was surfing Amazon when I read about Russell Watson. I had never heard of him before and when I received the CD I was so excited!! I love this CD and his voice. I think anyone that appreciates the wonder and amazement of beautiful voices, then buy this CD. I loved each song, but see for yourself."
2,My comments,"As a high school student, I'd just award grades for the various elements of this CD just like how teachers rate my school work:Voice quality: CSinging technique: DMusicianship: DMusic arrangement: DOrchestral performance: DChoice of songs: CSound quality: DCD booklet: CPackaging: BAs the average is around D+ I'll award this CD 2 stars."
2,Ambitious program,"People have been doing cross-overs for years, and therefore we shouldn't discriminate against new singers who prefer to go that path. Unfortunately, the record producers have chosen a far too ambitious program for Russell Watson, who doesn't yet have the strength of voice, the security of technique and the experience of a seasoned performer to pull it off. As a result, the singing here falls flat and some of the tracks are embarrassing. I hope there can be a better program design next time, which can then showcase the young singer in a better light."
5,The voice is from Heaven,Never have I been so swept away by such a peaceful yet robust baratone. Watson's range is unbeatable. Even the songs sung in other languages are beautifully translated and thoroughly enjoyable. The first note promised me that this CD would be a treat. I was not disappointed. Truly one of a kind.
2,too much padding,"russell watson has a lovely voice, and is a magnificent young singer. this CD has too much padding, too many fireworks, is ""over-produced"". i await a CD on which mr. watson is permitted to simply sing great arias and tenor-songs...no fancy orchestration, co-singers, etc."
1,Simply not good enough!,"Of course, Russell Watson cannot (and should not) be compared to classically trained singers. However, I don't think he's in the same league as genuine cross-over singers like Andrea Bocelli, Alessandra Safina or Mario Lanza, the reason being that Russell Watson has a far weaker voice than these singers and his singing is also less emotionally true or vivid. Thus, without considering about all those technical points or whether or not Russell Watson can perform classical arias, I would merely say that his singing here has left much to be desired. It is simply not competitive enough in an already well-occupied field."
5,"100,000 people can't be wrong about his talent.","I was one of those lucky people in attendance with some 100,000 people who attended Watson's New Zealand concert a year ago. It was the most exciting concert ever. Those in attendance adored Watson, not only for his stage presence, rapport with the audience, but his talented voice. We never felt so close to a singer in a venue filled with 100,000 people. That is Watson. On Voice, you will see why this singer is so popular with the ""people"", a few of which are familiar with good music. Listen to the first track, Nella fantasia. Not many singers can sing this song as beautifully as Watson."
5,"Wonderful, Wonderful CD","I first saw Russell Watson in a concert in England. Since then I have purchased all of his CDs! He is an incredible singer who sings opera, pop, anything! On this CD, when you listen to ""Nella fantasia"", ""Miserere"", ""Bridge Over Trouble Water"", ""Someone Like You"", and ""Nessun dorma!"", you will know what I mean. A wonderful, wonderful CD. Recommend it highly!"
5,'The Voice' Of A Thousand Words,"This is the first album to be released in the US by British opera singing sensation, Russell Watson.As soon as anyone hears the word `opera', the image of an old, over-weight, beefy guy who sings only in Italian/Latin is concocted. Well, that stereotypical image is about to be blown away by this guy!Russell Watson may sing opera, but that's where the similarities with other operatic singers seem to end. He is young, tall, dark and pretty damn handsome to boot! ;) He has a unique voice, which lends itself as easily to opera as it does to popular music.The album `The Voice' has the perfect mixture between classical opera and a more modern sound. The final collection of songs complements each other perfectly. Russell Watson also has the uncanny ability to appeal to people of all ages, from the youngest of children to your great-grandmother.The variety of songs means that there is almost something for everyone on this album! :) It's well worth the money!"
1,Wretched singing,"This is singing at its most wretched! While the singer is passable in most of the pop numbers, he fails to bring off the many intracacies in the operatic songs so that the listen can only experience perhaps 1 per cent of the full potential that the music can bring to a listener. (If some people is satisfied with such a misrepresentation or under-representation, it's their own matter. But I certainly don't think this is adequate at all.) His strained vocalism and the electronically enhanced voice and acoustic are terribly off-putting. A most awful album and a voice which I can't bear to listen to."
5,Watson is outstanding,"I will give this recording 5 stars, for the singing is very good indeed. Russell Watson just glides his way through the music. Such great singing has to be heard to be believed."
1,Far from perfect,"The singing in this cd is far from perfect. In fact, there're long stretches which can fairly be described as ludicrous.The singing skills of Russell Watson is really rudimentary to the extreme. His narrow voice range and weak tone, which require copious help from the record producers, simply cannot manage the songs, be their classical or pop.Some people may think that this is singing for ""everyone"". I must disagree, for such a kind of crooning will probably only please those who treat the music in this cd as sort of ""background noise"". Those who really apply their ears and minds to the singing will be dissatisifed, and indeed horrified, by its many shortcomings.This is certainly one of the worst cds that I've heard in my 2000 plus collection of recordings. It really deserve just one star, or maybe even less."
1,No range,"I just don't understand how people can describe Russell Watson's voice as one having a ""tremendous range"". If he indeed has such a range, he needn't transpose, and he also won't sing as stridently as he did for this album. In fact, even if that ""tremendous range"" description is related to emotion, it still doesn't ring true, because Russell Watson sings everything in the same manner without much emotional variation. And I agree with those who say that by simplifying the music, instead of drawing listeners attention to those interesting details, Russell Watson is doing no service to the music or his audience, which cannot claim that they've heard opera, as opera is not sung in that karaoke-like way. If we're talking about cross over, then Groban and Safina are more honest with their claims. The type of recording as represented by this album is to be avoided."
2,"""A"" voice - but definitely not ""THE"" voice.","I find it strange that the album touts the fact that Mr. Watson was not a trained singer. Why would anyone want to listen to an untrained opera singer? Mr. Watson is correct in that he ""can"" hit the notes and if the aim is to lure in people who have never listed to opera, then I applaud his efforts. However, I hope they understand that a true professional does not require the studio effects that this album uses to make a voice more appealing."
1,Colorless voice,"Don't understand why this album is called 'the Voice' as the voice of Russell Watson is colorless and lacking in charm. His singing technique is such that he fails to deliver the music properly. An embarrassing album, both for the singer and his fans."
1,Personal view,"Music appreciation is a very personal thing, and I can only express my own view, which others may disagree. The first thing is that I found Mr Watson's voice to be not that beautiful. The timbre is very ordinary indeed. I also found his singing to be rather charmless. It doesn't communicate. I often found the performance here bland and strident. I believe I listened with an open mind and these are merely my personal observations. Hope they won't cause any offence to anyone."
5,A Gifted and Moving Singer,"Although I'm not heavily into opera, this CD is great! Russell Watson is clearly a gifted singer. His voice is very articulate and moving, with lots of heart and soul. He's a real discovery.The CD also has several popular songs. Though the ""Barcelona"" piece has more of a rock slant, the CD finishes with ""Nessun dorma!"" I believe he performed that piece on Good Morning America last week (4/20/01?). WOW! I think this guy will open the eyes of many, and I believe he will have great success."
1,Hype (especially on TV) can sell almost anything,"and this recording is proof of it. I've heard it only on the radio (many times) and I had to agree with the announcer who said, ""That was Russell Watson attempting ... "" (I've forgotten what it was he was trying to sing.) ""Now,"" continued the announcer, ""for some REAL tenor singing.""It obviously isn't discerning opera lovers who have turned this recording into a bestseller. Opera lovers expect not only a decent voice but also good singing technique. Russell Watson has neither. But clearly he has a superb manager."
1,Better to listen more,"I hope that people who admire Russell Watson and appear to be so intolerant to his critics can listen and see more widely. The world is much bigger than they may have thought. I'm quite appalled at the suggestion that Russell Watson is better in some respects than ""the average opera singer"", who according to some ignorant ones, appear to be invariably ageing and generously proportioned men. In fact, there're many young opera singers around who not only have a much better voice and technique than Russell Watson, they can also act naturally on the stage and are more communciative as singers/stage performers. In fact, some are much more handsome than Mr Watson. Even as a subject matter for pure idolatry, Russell Watson simple doesn't make the grade."
5,10 - Stars,"Music is for everyone. It's felt in each individual's heart and soul. For me, Russell Watson has that heart and soul. The Voice is a wonderful collection of songs ranging from classical and pop. I would give it 10 Stars."
1,Makes a great coaster,"It upsets me to see a man with clearly little talent acheive such 'heights'... he's a marketing miracle - that's for sure. It's a shame really, there are so many REAL tenors with REAL training and REAL talent and here, to see this gasping, untalented, flash-in-the-pan obtain a record deal over others.. it's so upsetting. His album? Greatly disappointing, the man and his 'music' makes me feel sick to my stomach -- needless to say, I'm not a fan."
1,Worst singing of record,I'll make it brief: This CD captures some of the worst singing ever recorded. Anyone who has the slightest sense of good singing will laugh at the many vocal blunders of Russell Watson. Better avoid this.
1,Terrible!,"If you are musician with any training or taste, don't waste your money! A friend and I bought this cd a year ago in Europe, and found it quite funny. Watson claims to be the 'next Pavorati'. He has a terribly inconsistant sound, and it's simply not an attractive instrument to listen to. And - though surely no reviewer noticed - the end of his Nessun Dorma is rewritten so he can sing another shoddy high note. If you're looking for a tenor who's not among ""The Three..."" , try Marcelo Alvarez or good old Franco Corelli."
2,Doesn't live up to the hype,"After encountering so much hype about Russell Watson, I finally decided to give this album a try. Unfortunately, I was mostly disappointed by what I heard. No matter from what angle one looks at it, Russell Watson's performance here is just ordinary, sometimes less than that. Just like the inexplicable attachment of certain dedicated fans to some voiceless pop singers, the hype surrounding Russell Watson can probably be explained in the same way. But it is unfair to say that everything Russell Watson does isn't of an acceptable standard. For example, contrary to some of the views here, I actually like his ""Bridge over troubled water"". It is sincerely sung. Unfortunately, most of the tracks here aren't of such quality."
3,RUSSELL WATSON IS THE MALE SARAH BRIGHTMAN,Make of that what you will.... He even covers her version of Morricone's The Mission (Nella Fantasia)
1,Background music,"I recently bought this album and, having listened to it, am amazed by some of the comments here. I agree with one of Mr Watson's fans who've written here not too long ago, that he'd play this CD all day whenever he was working. Actually, he has actually hit the nail on the head - this CD is of such quality that it can only serve as background music, just like those flimsy tunes aired in shopping malls and hotel lifts, really that being fit of serious appreciation. However, if you concentrate on it without being distracted by other pursuits, its many flaws will at once become apparant."
2,Controversial with a reason,"After listening to this CD, I can now understand why Russell Watson and this recording have proved to be that controversial. The singer's good looks, the clever marketing as well as the fine presentation no doubt make both the singer and the CD attractive. On the other hand, the ordinary voice and bland delivery are disappointing and may lead to the objection of those whose focus is on the singing itself.Personally, I do think that the musical substance of a recording is of paramount importance, and therefore I'm not really satisfied with Watson's attempt here. I hope that, instead of paying too much attention to the singer's image, the record company should help this young singer to brush up his singing technique. That will be of greater help to the singer's career."
4,In Touch With The Younger Generation,"No matter what some critics are saying, I sincerely think thta, as a member of the generation who grew up in th 1980s, Russell Watson (and Andrea Bocelli for that matter) are really in touch with us. They are young, fresh and in the case of Watson, radiates the charms of his age. In the case of Bocelli, he really sings from his heart and his voice is really touching.I am sorry to say but for me (and many of my peers) the likes of Pavarotti, Domingo and Carrerras are too old, too stuffy (and fat too, for that matter) and I can't relate myself to them, no matter how much I love classical music."
4,New On The Scene,"Russell Watson is still relatively unknown, but that is about to change with the release of this album. Russell is a bit of a change from the norm as he has not gone down the usual route that most entertains have to go to get noticed. This album features tracks like Someone Like You, Bridge Over Troubled Water and Barceleona. Russell has captivated the Uk audience lets hope he can do just as well over shore"
1,Flawed recording,"The singing in this recording is flawed. The singer cannot even sustain a phrase properly and his singing is often strident and ugly. I also do not find the singing her to be communicative at all. Instead, it is uninteresting and rigid. I also don't like the recording ambiance, which sounds contrived and overblown."
1,Doesn't work for me,"I like pop music, but I don't think Russell Watson has succeeded in introducing me to classical music. For Domingo and Pavarotti, I do have respect for them, although I don't like what they're singing. With Russell Watson, I don't even have any respect, as he doesn't have any real artistry! In fact, I find the same music sung by Pavarotti to be more involving than when sung by Russell Watson? No, it doesn't work for me at all."
1,Russell Watson - The Voice,"The more I hear items from this record repeatedly plugged on the ""Classic FM"" program, the happier I am for not having bought it. You cannot prop up a voice such as his by mere sensationalism and elctronics. I would say that there is a good deal of promise here that could have been rewarded by hard training, but I doubt that he and his bankers would consider this. As one brought up hearing such tenors as Gigli, Tagliavinni and Bjorling, I have to pass this voice by. His ""success"" is purely financial."
1,What voice? What a joke!,"All singers' voices have a number of qualities that determine if that person is a good singer or not: Power, clarity, range, and (most ambigously) beauty. Watson has almost none of any of these things. Any halfway decent tenor can manage ""La Donna E Mobile"" without straining himself, but apparently Watson can't. It's idiotic to think an unskilled, untrained pretty boy with limited talent could ever be a rival for even the least talented professional opera singer."
3,Unsure,"I'm glad that musical artists besides opera singers are encouraging the art of opera. I also like some of his more upbeat selections as well. In my opinion though, I couldn't listen to his CD for very long. A couple of his arias sounded a bit splatty at times, and back in the throat at others. I don't claim to know everything about opera, I'm only in highschool, but his sound seemed quite pushed in places.When all is said and done,however, I hope more people will come to know and love opera through his music."
1,A worthless recording,This recording offers nothing: The voice that it features isn't of any great quality. The singing is terribly substandard. There's a serious lack of musicianship in the performances. The singer brings no new interpretative insights to the music.A totally joyless and unenjoyable release.
5,Wonderful & Delightful,"I listen to and love all types of music from classic rock to opera and everything in between. And this album has become my favorite. Russell Watson has a wonderful voice and the unusual mix of music on this album is -- though a little jarring the first time through (simply because it's unexpected) -- is delightful. I don't understand some of the other vehement & nasty reviews. Yes, we all like different stuff, but some of these reviews seem more like personal vendettas. As for me, I'm off to buy his second album, Encore. And I can't wait!"
5,A remarkable voice,"I have listened to this album. In my view, there is something remarkable about Russell Watson's voice. Is it his wonderfully, clean and crisp powerful delivery, his Sting-like pop voice, his smooth Tony Martin voice or his Neil Diamond voice? Whatever voice Watson uses, the singing in this album has all the charm in the world. The classical songs are sung with a new and fresh rendition, and the pop tunes are belt out in a swinging and feeling manner.As regards to those praises in this website, I agree with the many positive reviews."
1,"Watson might have a future in ""pop-era""","If I were to suggest that it is inappropriate to take a high school athlete -- let's say a basketball player -- blessed with a lot of raw talent, and then put him on the court with Michael Jordan, no one would call me a ""sports snob."" In fact, everyone would nod in agreement.Mr. Watson's handlers are to be blamed here. The singer has a lot of natural ability, and could, one day, be a good singer. But to assign an untrained vocalist a challenging repertoire of arias is unfair to the singer, and could, ultimately, hurt an otherwise steady career.It has nothing to do with elitism. A singer simply has to have breath support, modulation, intonation and dynamics.Again, I think this young man shows some promise, and his story is truly inspirational. So many people wouldn't love him if he didn't have some degree of talent and artistry. He just needs to acquire some semblance of a technique to really join the big leagues."
5,"Oh, if only all tenors were this pleasant to listen to!","Just bought this CD tonight and am listening to it over and over as I work on my computer. What a treat! His voice is full, mellow and just grand! He should have a marvelous careeer ahead of him. Looking forward to his next CD."
5,Wonderful.,"So intelligent and great! A really extraordinary recording. Not always seaking the ""loud"" side, nevertheless climaxes are there really strong."
4,Straight Forward,"This book has given me insight to the Pentecostal Movement and all of the people who were instrumental in the growth of what is part of many church doctrines. It is important to me to know belief system and the process of the various experiences that took place. Many churches today are probably different from what they started out as in the 1800's; and the book tells of the interesting and colorful past of the those beliefs. This book gives mostly every account and the details of the history. The book is easy to read and is well put together. I brought it for a class in the same area I am studying, but now I have made it a part of my library."
5,A thourgh overview of the roots of the Pentecostal movement.,"Mr. Synans work reflects his deep understanding of the evolution of the Pentecostal movement in the United States. Though his effort is marked by the occasional error (by no means excessive), the work is by far the most authoritative, comprehensive, and thought out Protestant historical/theological piece I have had the pleasure to read. Anyone who claims an affiliation with Christianity would do well to verse themselves in the pseudo-religion that is Pentecostalism, and Mr. Synans work is by far the most opportune avenue by which to know and understand this unusual religious practice."
2,technical glitches,"on the very first disc there were several places where the video froze and then shut off from playing. I had to try to skip around them, but was unable to see the end of episode 2. what do I do about this problem"
3,CC not accessible,"I love this series and bought it so I could read the subtitles because it's difficult to understand everything that's said. The box says cc (closed captioning), but I was unable to access it. I even called Acorn Media, and they said they would call me back but never did. I wasted my money - I could have gotten it from Netflix for a lot less!"
3,husband wanted,We are having trouble with the accents of the cast. Very slow moving plot. clothing awesome not my kind of movie
1,oh no.....,(cont' from my previous review)I just found out that it's too late to return the faulty DVD collection. I don't watch DVDs as soon as I get them so there was some delay between the time I received the DVD and when I found the time to sit down and watch it. I simply assumed they would be perfect like all the other DVDs I have received. Now I am out $89. I realize I should have read the return policy. But I didn't. I'm totally bummed.
4,Great,"My husband and I are really enjoying this series. Louisa and the others are interesting and enjoyable characters and the episodes contain lots of variety, humour, and intrigue.For watchers who want action and glitz this isn't for them, but for those who enjoy character studies and a good storyline, The Duchess of Duke Street is a keeper. I'll lend this one to most of my friends."
5,A Gem of a Series,"I had seen this when it was originally broadcast here in the early eighties and had loved it then. Watching it now.... I can only say that I couldn't wait to jump to the next DVD as each ended. I'm only sorry that I finished it again..... it's like reading a really good, meaty book that you never want to end.Wonderful story line, fantastic cast of characters, wonderfully acted."
5,Fantasic Story - The Duchess of Duke Street,"After quite a few years, I was given the entire CDs of Duchess of Duke Street as a birthday present. I knew that I had not seen all of the Episodes when it was presented on Masterpiece Theatre years ago. I just love the progress of the story and how it related to life in England and to the individuals involved with Mrs. Trotter and her progression in society. Most of all, I loved the honesty and caring person Mrs. Trotter was, despite the many trials and troubles she endured. I also thought that Charlie was a most decent and honorable person despite his station in society. I believe the actress who played the part was magnificent as was the actor who played Charlie.Georgina M. Rowan"
3,Very good album!,"It's not my favorite Paradise Lost album, but when we really enjoy the band's work, it's a ""must have"" cd."
2,Poor quality,"I agree with the other 1-star reviewer. These are not well made, all of the three pairs I ordered quickly became unusable after the material developing holes and bunched up."
5,classy socks,got me some a few months back and they are sporty and well worth the price and are very comfortable. i intend to buy morereal soon as I dig the feel and stretch of them.
5,excellent reference,"This is the best book I have found as a detailed reference for animal anatomy, with a complete description for every muscle on the horse's body. If you are prepared to do a lot of reading and in depth study, I highly recommend this book."
5,A Go-To recording,"This is one of the stars in my collection - I play it over and over again. Love it, especially the rendition of ""Saint Jame's Infirmary""!"
1,bad to the bone!!!,this book is a total waste. I have never seen such poor explanations as I have seen in this book.I can't say how many times I wanted to burn this book. I can not understand why any school would use this book. Its pretty bad...
2,poorly done,This book is very terrible as a textbook. It skips around alot and assumes too much. The explantions would have a professor scratching his head
1,Terrible,This is by far the worst college textbook I have ever read. There are no examples and the author doesn't clarify points that he is trying to emphisize
1,Must avoid,"This is a terrible book, it may work for experts in the field, but for students, this book is not a useful tool"
4,comfortable boot,"This is a very comfortable and attractive boot. I have the brown pair. It says memory foam, and maybe it is, but feels like regular padding to me. At any rate, it's comfortable. I would have liked it if the lining was real sheepskin instead of synthetic, but oh well. You can't really see it anyway.Yes, you can wear these all day, and they are very much like slippers. They are also narrow enough for me. Most shoes are too wide and slip all over the place. I'd have given these a 5 star rating had the lining been real."
3,Don't bother,"In theory this could have been a great story and certainly one which would nicely combat the usual way of studying the Holocaust. Unfortunately, it fell flat. It is neither particularly well written nor is there much depth. It is a collection of superficial facts and the occasional incompletely explored anecdote without any depth or feeling. The whole story, and even the characters who in real life must have been incredible people, are thoroughly forgettable. Perhaps the reason for this lies in the nature of the sources: people's recollections, but the author fails to add flesh to the skeletal outline they provided to him. Just not worth the money."
5,Chutzpah!,"This short book details the adventures of three young partisans from the Jewish ghetto at Vilna (Poland). They, and many others, fought the Nazi occupation with more courage than weapons, more anger than common sense. Determined to thwart the Holocaust as well as the occupation, our heroes blew up bridges, waterworks, and roads; they attacked armed soldiers so as to arm themselves; they often fought beside Polish and Russian anti-Semites to achieve these things. The Avengers was written by a young man who interviewed the young hero/heroines in their old age. This is a great book for young people to read; it shows what just a handful of people can achieve under the worst of circumstances, and it lends some insight into a much neglected subject of WWII: the unwillingness of some few to give in to horror and injustice of the grossest sort."
2,"Sadly, disappointing.","I loved Cohen's first book, ""Tough Jews"", which covered a most interesting chapter in American/New York/Jewish history, and which was well written and compelling. I found ""The Avengers"", however, disjointed, trite, and a far less enjoyable read. The most compelling thing going for this book is the story itself, which is remarkable, but I did not care at all for the fictitious conversations, the oversimplifications, and the generalizations which are sprinkled liberally throughout the book. The writing is somewhat staccato-like, and although I learned what the characters did each day, I didn't learn enough about what motivated or caused them to become the heroes they were. I'll look forward to the next one by Cohen."
2,Good book very badly read,"The book is pretty good. The reading is awful. King pauses at unnatural spots, runs sentences together without a pause (obscuring the logic), places the emphasis in weird places, and even mispronounces some words. I have never listened to amore badly read taped book."
1,TRASH,I PURCHASE THE KYB STRUTS FOR MY 2002 NISSAN MAXIMA SE FRONT AND BACK WITH NEW COIL SPRINGS THE STRUTS AND SHOCKS RIDE LIKE TRASHYOU FEEL EVER BUMP ON THE STREET DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON KYB TRASH.
1,"This short should be an extra, not its own DVD.","I saw this at the Library Of Congress about 10 years ago. It's merely a union organizing tool put out by the Seafarers International Union listing the benefits of membership for recruitement purposes. If that's your idea of cinema, have a go. You will definitely see Stanley Kubrick's name in the credits . . . and that's it. There is nothing Kubrickian whatsoever in this 29 minute film. You will gain no insight into Kubrick's early development. I have to wonder if the positive reviews are from people who stand to profit from the sale of this DVD. Watch it for free at ""Google Videos"" before spending money on it."
4,good piece of equiptment,"The water broom works ad advertised, however the picture is misleading. It looks like a long wand allowing you to work in upright position. But the item is listed with a 24 inch wand.The one you get is not what is pictured."
5,Awesome,"I used this textbook back in college. I minored in Japanese. After going through Nakama 1 and Nakama 2, I was able to speak, read and write Japanese at a 9th grade level. I had no prior knowledge of Japanese before I took the course.Disclaimer: In addition to Nakama, I had an awesome Japanese professor."
3,It's *okay*,"It's an alright book. I am halfway through my second semester of Japanese, and it is *okay*. I don't to actually expect to learn Japanese from this book, thankfully my teacher is really good.Anyway, to make up for this book I've started the AJATT method, so I'm learning kanji from RTK.If you search around online, you can find excel files with the vocab and example sentences from this book, which is really useful for studying from SRS, I wish I had found it sooner..."
2,The kids wouldn't eat them,The taste is similar to a very plain baked potato. The adult members of the household thought they tasted OK but would rather save their calories to spend on something better. The kids thought they were tasteless.
1,Maybe the worst potato chip ever,"After ordering this giant 24 pack, I discovered that I despise Potato Flyers. I can't even give them away. I asked my sister if she wanted the 23 bags that I won't be eating and she said ""no"" because she tried a couple of Potato Flyers once and 2 chips were enough for a lifetime. Potato Flyers are extremely thick and don't have good flavor. Robert's American Gourmet has good snacks, but this isn't one of them."
4,Perfect for what I need!,"This desktop calendar provides large, lined spaces for writing your notes, making it much easier to read what you have written. It's nothing fancy to look at, but it well serves its purpose. To its credit, this calendar can also be hung on a wall if you wish."
3,Power button,"The power button has to be pressed continuously for the toothbrush to work and the button is really hard to press, wish it had a little on-off switch. The head is irreplacable so the toothbrush is only good for so long. I will never buy it again."
4,Eros has real tallent.,"I started working on a doctorate in Rome a year ago. Prior to this I never listened to any ""foreign"" music other than from England for Pete's sake. Eros is excellent! His new ""9"" is solid. Even if you don't know the language, you'll like the songs. If you do know the language - Italian , he also sings in Spanish - you gotta get to know this guy. He's sold over 20 million C.D.'s in Europe! If that doesn't tell you something . . ."
4,Great Concert,"I love Eros and this concert is great, the only reason I did not chose 5 stars is because is not in HD. Eros is an excellent performer this concert is full of great music, great songs and a great performance by and incredible super italian star. I don't get tired of watching this concert over and over."
1,Hold your nose,"This is the ""if it ain't broke don't fix it..."" the title says it all... my second Delorme the one they fixed was great...too bad you guys don't have your own little consumers guide..all life is going to Vegas ..but sometimes it pains when you not only lose but are left with SH.....C Corcoran"
3,Complicated Interface,"Navigation around the program's screen is difficult.I had not updated my Street Atlas for several years and they havemade the use of the features less intuitive.Things like finding the current construction or weatheralong a route may be available but finding them is another matter.This leads to frustration when trying to use the program.I wish that they had kept their previous interface, but then that isthe way of computer software - make changes so they can release new versions and sell them."
3,Over the river and through the woods,"Overall this is a wonderful product, However, and I think this goes for most products of this type. The maps are outdated. I travel along many areas alot of which have seen a great amount of development, resulting in new roads or chaning road beds.The positives are a useful interface, the ability to import objects(I do a lot of geocaching and it is nice to have the caches as POI(points of interest on the map).), and being able to utilize a GPS unit with your laptop.The downsides are: The maps can be outdated before you even load the software on your laptop, Although I like the Roads less traveled in my adventrues and outdated maps do show the old road markings, Accuracy when finding something is important."
3,Still not quite there.,"I've been using Street Atlas since version 7, and my biggest complaint is they just don't update them very quickly. They claim they have added 268,000 new streets. Maybe, but not where I live. They are at least 3 years behind on major route changes. It isn't all bad. It's basically a pretty good program. That is why I've bought version after version. I use it with my notebook computer and the GPS adapter. However, this year I also bought a Garmin C320 stand alone GPS It puts Street Atlas to shame, and includes roads that are less than a year old. I'll continue to use both, but I don't think I will be running out to buy the next upgrade for Street Atlas."
1,Not User Friendly & Outdated Maps,I purchased Delorme Street Atlas USA 2006 w/gps LT-20 receiver a few days ago and don't like it at all. The software is very hard to navigate and is extremely outdated (at least in Colorado). I am working on getting my money back at this time. Do yourself a favor and don't waste your time and buy the Microsoft Streets & Trips product w/GPS instead.
2,Very Disappointed with StreetAtlas 2006,"The interface is the same confusing tabbed interface DeLorme has used in the last versions (love it or hate it - I hate it).They finally fixed the ability to search for an address that isn't on the current screen by using advanced search to enter a city and state or zip code (something earlier versions did but that DeLorme broke when they switched to the tab interface).The big problem is grossly outdated map files. There may be lots of updates SOMEWHERE in their map files, but in the Louisville Kentucky area the map files are more than two years out of date. I'm not talking about some back road out in the country or a brand new subdivision. Louisville is one of the 20 largest cities in America and StreetAtlas 2006 completely omits major through routes in downtown Louisville.Grossly outdated maps are totally unacceptable in a product that requires buying a complete new version every year or two just to get supposedly ""updated"" map files."
3,"Okay, for what it is. . .","A graphic snapshot-oriented (regardless of camera format) spit-and-piddle glossy. If you're looking for fine art nudes or fine art erotica, look elsewhere. The Fourth Body follows a newly emerging trend towards grit, grime, and pissing (private and public) artificially posed as candid shots--Not that there's anything wrong with that, if that's what you're looking for, but I wasn't. (When I want grit, grime, and pissing, I buy REAL porn, not porn possing as art.)Beyond that--the compositions, lighting, editing, and final prints are mediocre at best. No depth of emotion or anything that goes with you or makes you understand anything new about being human.You'll flip through this book a few times and then sell it (covered with dust, five or so years from now) in a garage sale for $1.75."
3,Second Parts never were good,"This album is more of the same, recycled shots from his previous two volumes. I could not avoid the impression that I was seeing what was left out during the edition of Volumes II and III."
4,"Great hood, but not for the 24-105 lens!","I bought this lens for my 17-40mm f/4 L USM glass as I use a 1.6x FOVCF body (30D and 40D) and the hoods that come with these lenses are designed for full-frame bodies. On crop sensors, these hoods are WAY too wide and I get flare. This hood performed beautifully on my 17-40 L glass with no vignetting even when wide open and with an L39 sharp cut UV/Haze filter on it!"
3,"An odd, disturbing book","This novel studies the traumatic effect of the assassination of a prominent conservative senator on those closest to him, namely his two disturbed brothers and his current, and equally disturbed, wife. Dark, unsettling, and difficult to understand at times, it is still a recommended reading experience."
3,Almost first rate,This is a well-played and occasionally insightful performance which is eclipsed both by the sublime sonorities of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under Fritz Reiner and the finely detailed counterpoint revealed by George Szell and the Cleveland Symphony.
2,still using,"still use, review is years old popped up today.. unit about 4 years old maybe more doesn't lock into place anymore is only problem"
5,Experimental blend!,"This is SJM's second album, and much more ambitious.When I first heard it I thought it was way out there, but I knew I'd like it. Repeated listenings and I eventually had to list it as one of my favorite albums.It's a tough blend to describe - some funk, metal, rap, prog.. with a Mr Bungle-worthy short attention span and a similar blend at times.Four Japanese girls who are great musicians and one of the tightest bands. Too bad their singer passed away a few years ago."
4,Rock/Pop Japanese Style,"If you're looking for something that's good but want to escape from the norm, this is the cd you need. The music is well-performed, and the lyrics are interesting and unique Though it can get a bit annoying at times, it's worth a listen or two. I would recommend it more or less to the college age crowd."
3,Charmed -- The Soundtrack,"The reason why I gave this CD only a ""3"" was because I really only bought it for one song -- ""How Soon Is Now"" (the theme song for the show). I must say that they've edited it cunningly for use as the theme song, so if you purchase this like I did expecting to hear the version used on the show, the version of this CD is slightly different, but it's still a great song. If you want to hear a really great version of this song, buy the Smiths ""The Singles"" and hear the original."
5,Better then believed to be,"I have loved the show ""Charmed"" ever since I started watching it, and have been waiting for a CD and DVD to come out (still waiting for the DVD). I bought the Charmed soundtrack the very first day it came out and was thrilled to finally own it. After listening to it once, I was a little bummed it wasn't as good as I thought it would be. I told myself to listen to it again, and I began to like it. Now I listen to it all the time! The music is a variety so everyone will like at least a few songs. With each song you feel a different connection to the show, but each song is great!"
2,Came quickly but crappy,I was glad my purchase arrived so quickly but unfortunatly the case was completly ruined and it was taped together so much that I almost couldn't get the cd out. The quality is fine and it is a great cd.
2,Need help with series soundtrack,"I thought this CD contained the soundtrack for each weekly series. I have been trying to find out the name of the song that was played every week on their series. It begins with ""I am the sun, I am the moon....could you tell me that and then i could purchase the CD that has that song. i was upset i spent money on something i didn't care for."
2,charmed,"i think i'm being generous by giving the Charmed soundtrack two stars - a friend of mine bought it before me and we were listening to it one afternoon, and thank god she bought it first! I would have killed myself if i did! The soundtrack could have been better - why did they put songs mainly from the 5th season?! The 1st to the 4th had awesome music, any song from any of those seasons would have been great...if Charmed comes out with another volume - and if anything, just to make up for this one - then please PLEASE put on songs from older seasons!"
4,The Charmed CD,"The cd had good songs from the series. It played nice with no scratches, good sound, and nice picture! It was real fun to listen to."
5,Charmed soundtrack,"This is a great Charmed soundtrack CD. It has a lot of the tracks from club P3 (Piper's club). The T.V. show helped a lot of bands get heard & seen. If you loved the T.V. series, buy this CD."
3,Interesting and clever,The story of a young student at the islamic school who doubts of his ability to become a mollah. A sharp trip into the less known (clerical and non-clerical) parts of a big city like Tehran.
3,Not the worst book ever,"This was not the worst book I have ever read, but I wasn't all that impressed with it either. Sus5an is so dumb when it comes to boys. She has this perfectly great guy who is also an artist who likes her, and yet, she has to pursue an idealized uncle who you can tell from the first page of the book is only going to get her in trouble. It would seem that Sus5an would have thought a little more about what her family and friends said about the guy before deciding he was this wonderful person she remembered. It also makes Sus5an look way too naive in the book. Sure, she's from Utah, and I will admit people from Utah can be a little naive sometimes, but she just seems almost dumbly naive. Didn't she ever wonder if there was at least some truth in what her family told her about this uncle?"
2,Good for a view....,"Used to see this on TV in the 80's. If you dont mind cheap effects, there are some treasures in this movie...the cave...the egg...some welldone scenes. But overall i was dissapointed and can only recommend tofans of this genre."
1,Just bad.,"This was fairly painful to sit through, and towards the end I resorted to FF in order to make it all the way. I have a high tolerence for bad movies but this offered nothing. Totally bad monsters and effects. After this film, I was wishing that Amazon had a DVD return policy."
1,Not worth buying,"I purchased this book after reading How to Create You Own Unit Study. In this book, she talks about the 5 Rs of Unit Studies: Research, Reading, Writing, Recording and Reporting. This book presents very little new information. The Recording and Reporting sections had some new info, but the other sections were just a re-write from the other book with different examples.The most frustrating thing I found about this book was constantly being referred back to one of her other books. She'd start a topic, then say, ""For more information, read my book For the Love of Reading."" Had she entitled this book Why You Should Purchase All of My Books, the title would have been just as accurate (possibly more so) as the title she chose."
2,Target,"I took a chance ordering the teakettle since it was from Target. I assumed I would be able to return it directly to the store. It didn't work out (the color was not what I thought) and I e-mailed Amazon to find out if I could return it directly to Target. Amazon replied promptly that they had forwarded my question to Target for them to respond. After not getting a reply, I went on Target's web site and found out I would have to mail it back. Target had packed the teakettle in a box twice it's size (oversized) and I couldn't use the automated mail system, so had to wait in line for 20 min at the post office located behind Target! My fault for assuming, but I won't order from Target again."
1,GARBAGE ON A MAC,"I found this scanner at Staples across the street - I grabbed it because it was easy to get. Well, so is VD. It held up for about 1/2 dozen documents, then began crashing: the program (""scan pro"") quits every time. Wasted plenty of time trying to find help at the website - wound up chucking the damn thing into the trash with the rest of the kitchen stink. If you're on a mac, don't waste time with HP. I should have known better."
1,hated it,"i dont think this is worth the money. It barely scans anything at 1200dpi and darkens all slides and negatives by at least 10 shades. it will not copy anything with words, and takes over an hour to scan anything at a high resolution and the program often freezes up and you have to turn off and re start your computer"
1,"""Frustrating"" does not begin to express my feelings!","I have now spent more than 10 hours downloading software patches, deleting programs, adding programs, & rebooting -- all to no avail. Not 1 scan has completed successfully. My system is a well maintained Dell Dimension running Windows XP-Home with 512 meg main memory and a 100 gb hard drive that is less than 25% full. I run Norton Systems Works, Corel Paint Shop Pro X and Roxio Easy Media Creator Suite 8 software without problems. I installed a HP Photosmart 8250 printer in Mar. 2006 that has performed and continues to perform well & problem free.HP customer support for the scanner promptly replies to my email and provides suggested solutions. However at this point, even if they eventually supply a solution that works, it will not make up for the veritable torture inflicted.I find it incredible that HP offers its scanner products with such poorly functioning included software. I doubt I will ever purchase an HP computer related product again!"
3,Functional but glitchy.,"I've been using this scanner for a few years and it has been reasonably dependable. I needed a scanner with a large bed in order to scan book covers and other 3D items. It has worked well for my purposes though it has always had a persistent high pitched squeal whenever it is turned on. In addition, heavier items cause it to rattle a bit (any book over 3 lbs). It's been an OK machine despite its quirks. If one were to look at my profile, the vast majority of the images I have loaded on Amazon were scanned with this model. The bundled software was sufficient for my needs as well though basic in nature."
5,This scanner is very nice.,"I purchased another scanner on Amazon and returned it shortly after due to horrible performance. I bought this scanner instead and have to say it was very easy to set up, works perfectly and is an attractive addition to my computer. I highly recommend this for general at-home scanning tasks."
1,DON'T EVEN CONSIDER BUYING THIS SCANNER,"I have been trying to install the software for 5 months. No one from HP can even help. Each time I call HP I'm on the phone for at least 15 minutes & the problem still exists. I am not happy with the machine. But I am most unhappy with HP's ""technical support""."
5,A book you won't forget,"A slim, elegant collection of dreams, compiled by journalist Charlotte Beradt and smuggled out of Germany during the 1930s in code. Published in the 1960s with a terrific afterward by Bruno Bettleheim (I think he's a bit hard on her though--she wasn't a psychologist), it's bizarre that this book has received so little attention. Somebody needs to do a cheap paperback edition & get it out in the world. These dreams show--with haunting resonance--how people are remade from the inside out by totalitarian regimes."
3,Different Producer?,"Luka Bloom started his musical career playing a fast finger picking banjo with his brother Christy Moore in the Irish folk band Planxty, then he went solo with a fast strum guitar because of carpel tunnel or some physical problem with his fingers. Later in his solo career he slowed down the music, for example ""Before Sleep Comes"" when his hands needed a rest. Yet all his CD's had a certain tone & skill which keep you listening for Luka Bloom as one of the strongest songsmiths out there. Try the CD's ""Acoustic Motorbike"" or ""Between the Mountain & the Moon"" to sample Luka's highest musical art. With this CD, his guitar work is almost lost within a sound effect field. It doesn't sound like Luka Bloom at all, but a copy of some 1980ish rock band, mainly R.E.M. with their CD ""Monster"".I wish to know if the change in sound & style was due to his on going phyical problem with his hands or did the new producer Simon O'Reilly come up with this idea?"
1,Don't Listen to This While Driving!!!,"I can't believe I'm about to write this...because I'm a HUGE Luka Bloom fan. I've bought all of his CDs, and love them all, with the exception of WHEN SLEEP COMES. And sorry to say, I'm not thrilled with TRIBE, either. All the songs sound the same--quiet, with no melody, no hook, no typical Luka sound. I listened to this while driving back from Myrtle Beach, and I swear, I almost fell asleep. Seriously! I had to eject it and put in another CD to wake me up so I didn't run off the road!It's almost impossible for me to believe that this CD was recorded by the same man who gave us beautiful songs like ""Sanctuary"" and ""Fertile Rock""--and all the songs on ""Riverside"" and ""Innocence."" Sorry, Luka, but for me, ""Tribe"" was a snoozefest. I trust (hope, pray) that his new CD, ""Storm,"" brings back the Luka Bloom I know and adore!"
4,good stuff,"The strengths of this book are are many. Probably its strongest point is that the authors really understand how google works, and do a good job of communicating how this affects your searches. The discussion of advanced searching techniques I found to be very useful; I now use the -, """", and site: opeartors on a frequent basis.Downsides to this book are that the authors sometimes start conversation on a topic at a very basic level, so if you've been around the block a few times there will be sections you just skim and think ""yeah, yeah"". Also, some discussion in the latter half of the book is a bit wordy."
4,Excellent,"This has been an excellent buy for me. Have had no issues with it. Looks very very attractive and the padding at the bottom also looks good. Gives the flexibility of wearing it as formal or casual.Note: the dial on this watch is large. So if you prefer small dial watches , stay away from this."
5,"Excellent watch, looks good",I purchased this watch at about $40 less as compared to so called lowest price at J C Penny. Looks great. Only complaint is date is not all that visible
4,Summerhill,"It a refreshing book, you can ""feel"" the sincerity of the author. It could change you life for the better."
5,Worth the Buy,"I enjoy all of the fables series, but this is a must read for fans! I've read 1-7 so far, and I rather like this one."
4,An interesting,"This book was great to look at for me. First of all a picture of my house (which is circa 1835, though stated differently in the book) is in the book, and the author (R. Woods) was my 9th grade biology teacher. If you enjoy Long Island history you most likely know a little about Oceanside, or Christian Hook as it once was called. Nathans might ring a bell. This book has a great collection of photographs and information regarding the development of the town. Interesting stuff, especially for someone of the area."
2,A big shortcoming...,"I love Emanuel Ax and his playing, but there is a glaring flaw on this CD that cannot be overlooked. The recording quality of this CD is terrible! I first noticed it with the Rondo: Presto in the Sonata XVI:48 in C. Ax plays it wonderfully, but unfortunately, you can't hear it!!! The microphone sounds like it was hundreds of feet away, and all of the detail in his playing is lost in the endless reverberations you hear. Essentially, it sounds like he's holding the pedal down the entire time. Overall, this is not a good recording, and it distracts from Ax's wonderful playing."
2,Another opinion...,"Out of this book's 98 Pages, (including the index) 83 discuss different Macaw species and their origins. There are just 6 pages dedicated to keeping a Macaw and they are large print and filled with photos. Yes, the photos are nice and if you want to know about Macaws themselves (maybe for a book report) this is a good source. If you live with a Macaw and want a book that will provide you with practical info for daily interaction, I'm afraid this book won't help much."
1,Waste of Time,"This book is a literal translation from a very old, out-dated German text. It provides no useful information for today's companion macaw owner. It does have nice pictures. Pass on this one!"
4,Cream of the crop of indie dance-rock-electro choons!,"You cannot go wrong with the sheer volume, variety, and quality selection here of the coolest indie rock/dance/electro floor-fillers here - from lo-fi rawk of CAZALS, FIERY FURNACES, or THE KILLS to the amazing remixes by MYLO, PHONES, WHITEY, plus mainstream crowd-pleasers like BLOC PARTY and KILLERS, this is the a great-value package all the way around, that might cost you $200+ if you tracked down all the rare import 12""s - guaranteed to rock a party right!"
2,Not worth the pesos,"If you have seriously explored living or moving to Mexico via other books, websites or through travel, I suspect you will find this book repetitious, shallow and unattributed. The authors use lots of generalities. They do provide plenty of good cautions, plus criticisms for ugly American syndrome. They also do not gloss over the sizeable differences anyone living in Mexico must expect and accept--or be miserable. This book was a disappointment."
2,editorial intrusions,"There are many good data points in this book, however, the author insists on revealing that he comes from a disfunctional family, suffers from The Fatigue, and harbours a (sour grapes?) dislike for automobiles and well-heeled gringo retirees. This might irritate anyone who purchases this book as a reference aid, and unfortunately, also seems to compromise the author's objectivity."
1,get off my lawn!!!,"This is the worst ""living in mexico"" book that I've read. It has about 10 pages of interesting info. The other 190 pages contain various diatribes about ""what's wrong with kids today"". Here are a few gems:Hippies are dirty and smelly: (2 pages)I hate driving! (10 pages)Can you believe these violent video games? (3 pages)Why does a 12 year old need a cell phone? (4 pages)Americans are fat and obnoxious (20-30 pages)Society needs to be more god-fearing (5 pages)I love star trek! (10 pages)...and the list goes on.You may think I'm exaggerating, but I'm not. This book is a waste of money."
1,80% the author hates the US vs. 20% information about living in Mexico,I can't post anything here that hasn't been said in one of the many one star reviews already posted. The author is more concerned with focusing on the negative aspects of the US to the point where he losses focus on what the majority of readers will purchased the book for - helpful information on deciding whether to move to Mexico or not and how to live there if they do move.Anyone who is considering moving to Mexico probably already has reasons for thinking of living outside the US. His effort would have been better spent explaining the pros and cons of Mexico itself or the ins and outs of how to get things done there. Even an objective comparison between the US and Mexico with the emphasis on how some of the conveniences Americans are used to are not available would be acceptable.This is just an overdone anti-US editorial.
2,THIS BOOK FELL SHORT,THIS BOOK DID HAVE SOME GOOD INFO BUT IT WAS STRONGLY OVERSHADOWED BY A PRIMAL SCREAM NEGATIVITY ( WHAT'S WRONG WITH ALL THE OTHER AMERICANS LIVING IN MEXICO). IT COULD HAVE BEEN SO MUCH BETTER !
1,disappointing to say the least,"With so many good books on the topic available, don't waste you time on this one. Not well written, it is more of a series of the author's opinions about how the US has gone to hell in a hand cart and very little real helpful information about expatriation."
1,"part travelogue, part tirade, often annoying","I am giving this book one star because it does provide useful advice on a topic, moving to Mexico, about which few books are written.However, the useful information in this book-length temper tantrum could have been distilled down to a pamphlet. No doubt a judicious editor should have taken a very large axe to the original manuscript. It is continuously repetitive and the constant! use! of! exclamation! marks! wore! me! down!If there is another edition of this book I hope the author focuses his energy on explaining important things we should know about moving to Mexico and less on tangential diatribes about what is wrong with America and modern society."
4,"Hey, it's pretty good.","I disagree with the reviewer who said that they ""phoned this one in"". Although the documentation with the CD is scant, and no real information can be found about the CD on their website(Have they broken up or what?), I think it's clear that this material is not ""new"", but a release of older outtakes made before they got famous. (the sound quality is proof of this alone)It's interesting to hear the Jerkys do their thing in this longer format, the flower shop calls being the best example of that. The mixing of the characters in the same call, the extent to which they antagonize this lady - it's all at a level that we've never heard before. I thought it was pretty darn funny. Pick it up. It's at least as good as ""Stop Staring At Me!"". You may even like it more because it's a change of pace from the usual shorter bits."
3,Primitive Calls,"The Jerky Boys have broken up and Kamall had released his solo-project last year. These calls are probably off the duos earlier works (before the signed a record contract). I would assume that many of these calls were done in the late 1980s and had the original Jerky Tapes a few years ago, however, I do not recognize some of the calls on the CD version. There could have been a little bit more calls on here (I am sure there are 1,000 of unreleased prank calls). Anyway, the calls on here are funny, innovated, and are what The Jerky Boys were all about."
1,A Hard to read book,"This the most hard to read book I've ever met. The new people to the ATM will get lost in a short time in the words, and experts of ATM can not find any useful information in a short time. The writer never explain the new concept and abbreviation clearly. It seems that he is not writing this book to let readers read, but murmuring to himself. Don't wast time on this book like the victim as me."
1,The foundation is crumbling,"This book was assigned as a textbook for a class. Fortunately,the class included lecture because the textbook lacks coherentexplanations for the most basic principles. As an engineeringtextbook, it is quite poor. Explanations are vague and contain little relevant detail. Perhaps the worst feature of the entire book is the index. For a 434 page book, a two page index is not even close to enough. In defense of the index though, those 434 pages are all large type with many useless, cartoonish, redundant illustrations. As a brief overview, this may be adequate. But, for the price, I certainly expect more meat and less fat, something with the quality and content approaching that put out by Stallings or Tanenbaum."
2,Hard to learn from and hard to look up anything,"Any valuable content in this book is totally overshadowed by a lack of organization and a very poor typographic presentation. Although the book was published in 1999, the diagrams appear to be created an DOS 3.0 drawing program. This book needs an editor and a designer.The book is over 400 pages, yet the index is only 2 pages and omits dozens of terms one would need when using the book as a reference. Apart from the index there are close to 5 pages of abbreviations, but with no page numbers referenced, they're not too much help.No amount of useful information (which I am still looking for) or good writing within it can make up for the fact that this book is poorly *made*. If you are looking for a book to teach or learn from, this is not it."
2,A broad but disorganised coverage,"The preceding panalopy of one star anonymous reviews for this book seem somewhat false to me. In truth, while there is little order or sense to the content of this book, it does contain useful information, and is not wholely indecipherable. Having worked with ATM during the period when forum White Papers were nearly the only real informational resource available, this book does represent a step foward in that it forms a viable shortening of the information load needed to comprehend ATM networking. While I cannot regard it as a masterfully crafted book, it has its place in my library. Better to read this tome to begin with than to attempt to face that tower of White Papers without guide again."
1,Not recommended at all,"This book is among the worst books I have ever read, I regret that I bought it, the book talks about ATM in breadth and there is no in-depth technical disscussion,as an example, ATM switching a very important subject is disscussed in 26 pages ! , I don't recommend it to any one, not for a beginner nor for advanced level reader."
4,Switching VoIP book review,The book is a definitely helpful tool in understanding the world of Voice over IP. It helps explain what the terminology as well as what is being accomplished in the industry with it. I would recommend the book to all.The seller of the book also accomplished all that was promised of what was specified in purchasing a used book. I was very satisfied with the product.
3,Lots of information,"Since I'm starting with a knowledge base of zero there is a lot of good information in this book. For technical information it is realtively easy to read. Information may be dated at this point, I won't know till I catch-up."
5,Reese Product,This unit fit almost perfectly. My son and I installed in about an hour.All the bolts are included.Had to drill two holes on my windstar frame but no big deal.I use it to haul my 18 foot boat.
4,great price,"great price, but wouldn't recommend for people with slightly bigger heads.. i look kind of dump but my friends look pretty fly.."
4,great items,"this sunglasses are fresh cheap and great, i love them when they arrive i recomenden for ppl who want a vintage look"
1,Sunglasses in the parcel was not,situation isI myself am from Russiawaited for a parcelopen all that it is orderedbut these sunglasses in the amount of 6pcsis such an unpleasant storyparcel was sealed and apparently has not been opened before
1,bull&#!),"i ordered the spring break aviator 6-pack. with the choice of frames. and instead of getting aviators, i got wayfarers. they totally screwed my order up. and that was only my second purchase through amazon....not sayin much for business or quality now is it."
3,"1/3 Wrinkled, stamped with ""Fellowes""","Out of 20 packs purchased, about 1/3 were wrinkled. They still function, but don't look as professional as the smooth plastic. Important to note: the top strip of each disc holder is imprinted with the Fellowes logo, and you may not want your project to be an advertisement. My solution was to cut off the top plastic strip with the label (leaving just the 5x5 pouch).Overall, these seem to be higher quality and cheaper (at least from this seller) than other 5x5ish disc pouches I've seen elsewhere."
2,Wrinkled Plastic,"In the pack of 5, I had 1 that was perfect (and looks great!). Unfortunately the other 4 are badly wrinkled and so look completely unprofessional. 3 of the pack are wrinkled really badly. Just to be clear, they are badly wrinkled out of the box - I haven't put a CD in them, nor have I stuck them to anything. I have ordered another pack from another site."
2,Avoid the flaccid performance by Bernstein,"The Cello concerto by Yo-Yo-Ma and Eugene Ormandy is adequately played (I would recommend getting an interpretation by Rostropovich, however).The real let-down is the Fifth symphony, a normally electrifying work, that is played so ponderously by Bernstein that the listener quickly loses interest. Try the versions by Mravinsky, or pretty much any other version, for that matter, it is hard to imagine this symphony played worse than in this recording."
2,"Turgid Allegretto, too-slow Allegro non troppo make a bad symphony, offset Largo","To me, the Allegretto, though not an Allegro, needs to be taken much faster than Bernstein does.In essence, I hear and feel this as Shostakovich doing a scherzo-like parody of a Mahlerian Austrian Laendler slow movement. If you listen to a good interpretation of this symphony, in this movement, or listen **through and below** a not-so-good performance, you'll soon grasp this.Bernstein occasionally gets the drive of a parodic dance rhythm, but it's often just too slow.And, in the finale, yes, the Allegro is tagged with the ""non troppo"" modifier, but ""not rushed"" does NOT mean ""dragged out."" Nor does ""majestic"" mean ""put the brakes on.""Unfortunately, does any of this surprise you? This is Lenny.The older he got, the more inconsistent and even bombastic he became.The Cello Concerto is very good under Ormandy's direction and Yo-Yo Ma's performance.I wavered between two and three stars, but finally fell on two."
4,"Great Recordings, But...","The Shostakovich Symphony No. 5 and the Cello Concerto featured here are great recordings, but I would suggest buying different CDs. First, I find the Bernstein Century version of the 5th Symphony to be superior in terms of emotional quality to this Bernstein version, and the Bernstein Century disc includes Shostakovich's 9th Symphony as well. However, you should be aware that the Bernstein Century performance is from 1959 (though it sounds amazing!), and this one is a digital recording from the 80s. In terms of the Cello Concerto, the exact same recording is available on a Yo-Yo Ma CD that couples the Shostakovich with the incredible Kabalevsky Cello Concerto. I know it costs more to purchase two discs than one, but the additional music is just so good you shouldn't skip it. Trust me, I bought this title first, then traded it in for the Bernstein Century and the Shostakovich/Kabalevsky. Don't repeat my mistake."
5,Excellent,This is an exciting and well played recording of Shostakovich's Fifth Symphony. Leonard Bernstein was one of the best interpreters of the Fifth Symphony. Even Shostakovich himself thought so. Yo-Yo Ma performs the Cello Concerto almost flawlessly.
2,I agree with Fazal,"This is a response to the previous review by Fazal Majid.I couldn't possibly agree with you more. So slow, so dull. I had never heard another version before this one, and I thought that I didn't like the symphony. But actually, the symphony is very nice - it's Bernstein's rendition that I don't like. This symphony, like most of Shostakovich's work, needs a little speed to give it some life. I subsequenly bought the Ashkenazy 2004 live recording, whose timings by movement are almost identical to Mravinsky's. I'm waiting for it to be delivered now, and have high hopes for it. I already own Ashkenazy's recording of Shostakovich's 7th, and it's very good - fleet, unemotional, direct and exciting."
1,Total Rubbish,"I put one star because amazon wouldn't let me leave it blank, but the one star is totally undeserved. This is the worst book I have ever read on the subject. The authors put forth theories and have nothing to back it up. There are no references or citations to show that the authors are basing their theories on anything other than their own imagination. Not worth the money or time. Extremely disapointing."
4,loved it,"I have loved this book since I first read it. She's ordinary, just like you and me, and unlike the main characters in more recent literature, she's not rude and bad-tempered. The only problem I have with the book pictured is the awful cover. The one I had was purple, with Princess Amy looking to be in her late teens, which is the age she is in the book. I hate to be mean, but the new cover is horrible, the girl is much too young and looks like a pug. Who translated ""ordinary"" into ""ugly""?"
4,"Pretty Amazing Book, I Wish it Were A Novel!","This was a sweet, interesting, intruiging tale. One of those things where most any reading level can catch on and indulge in it. It's quick-paced with a nice, steady flow. I often found myself recognizing it being a book meant to be understood by many, and only desiring that it be even more fleshed out. The personalities, the characters, ect. Some slip in and go, return, go, ect. I was in such an apetite for the book's story line and the goings that I just would have liked more! So that's a good thing. I encourage the author to write another version of this. One for the younger readers is written, and another for those who'd love even more details of this enchanted story. Read this, regardless. It's loveable."
4,Short and Sweet,"Kaye's The Ordinary Princess is a smart short book that breaks away from the ""traditional"" framework of the ""typical princess"". Princess Amy, the seventh in a line of blonde princesses, is given the gift of mediocrity by the Fairy Crustaccea (slightly parodying the Sleeping Beauty plotline). The gift of being ordinary soon develops Amy into an individual that people are more able to relate to than the frail, delicate princesses that the other sisters become. Thus the adventures of ordinary princess ensue, resulting in love, friendship, and happiness of an extraordinary degree."
5,I think that this book is terrific!,I really enjoyed this book because it's packed with fun for everyone who reads it. It's about a lively girl who believes in herself.
5,Not an ordinary fairy tale,I first read this book in 4th grade from my school library. After that I borrowed it 9 more times until I left school. Search for a copy today or you'll be sorry.
3,A princess of a different color...,"Amy (short for Amethyst Alexandra Augusta Araminta Adelaide Aurelia Anne) is anything but an ordinary princess. Caring nothing for her royal status and oblivious to the social danger she poses to her family (never before had a Phantasmoranian princess grown up to be a spinster), Amy sets off to live in the most agreeable fashion she knows how--surrounded by nature, or, when need be, with the unpresuming commonfolk in the kitchen of a neighboring kingdom's castle. Amy is refreshing for her simplicity and sweetness, her innocence and her wit, qualities which are apparent in every choice she makes. And the end is absolutely charming, though it shows that, in this genre, not even a non-traditional heroine can escape her fate of ending up as a royal bride.I recommend reading this tale if you're ready for a ""princess of a different color,"" but don't be surprised if you recognize some of the plot elements... it is, after all, the story of an ordinary princess."
4,WHY WHY WHY did they change the cover art????,"I don't need to go over the storyline. If you are reading this, you probably already know it. I just can not believe that the beautiful cover art done by the author was replaced with such a horrible image in the reprint. It would have looked better blank. They chose a picture of a girl who bears no resemblance to the pictures inside the book or to the mental image I have of Amy. If you really want a true copy of the book, check out Half Price Books or your local used bookstore."
4,"Sweet, but not quite as trangressive as billed","This is a very charming book, but I'd have assumed it was written longer ago than 2002. A bit too focused on cliched boy/girl roles and marriage as the only happy ending (even though it purports not to). Still, a really fun read."
1,Ordinary review,"well, it is the worst book i ever read in my whole life.But still it's O.K, and also it is normal."
5,A heart-warming story for all ages,"I really didn't know what to expect when I purchased this book, but I was very pleasantly surprised. It is very well written and is a very good story about how looks are not what makes a person interesting or special, a message that is very pertinent today. It's as simple or as complex a story as you make it to be;one that has appeal for all ages, but would most definitely make a good bed-time story. I loved it and will read it again and have already recommended it to my friends."
5,A delight for all ages,I purchased several copies of this book for all of my great nieces for summer reading.I am 62 years old. Kept a copy for myself and have read it twice in the last week.Delightfully entertaining story suitable for adults as well as children. Beautifullyillustrated by the author herself. Marvelous wordplay. This is a childrens fairy talemasterpiece.
5,A Classic,"This story is so sweet. I read this over and over as a little girl, and still read it to this day. The main character, Amy, is ""ordinary,"" while her sisters are beautiful, but she is the one who has the wonderful adventures. It is truly a timeless story that has a good lesson behind it without seeming to teach a lesson at all."
5,One of my favorite books,"I loved this book when I was little. And, even now, whenever I come across it I can't put it down. It's a great book for little girls. With all the unrealistic, perfect princesses there are these days, it's nice to read about an ordinary one. It is a fantastic book"
5,Extraordinary! Should be a better known princess story!,"I remember this story from when I was a little girl. My mother clipped out a shortened version of it from a magazine for me and I loved it and kept it with it's stapled pages tucked between my books. Now as an adult I was looking for a great princess story for my elementary students to work on adapting into a play and I remembered the story and went on a hunt to find it. I was completely delighted to find and finally read the full story. All of the kids in my group LOVE it and identify with Amy. Their extraordinary selves being able to revel in their ""ordinary"" qualities and have their differences be cause for celebration. I adore Amy and hope to share her with more kiddos through the years!"
5,For young and OLD!,I plan to read it to my Grands!! My 70 yr old Book club friends will enjoy again too! thanks1
5,Proof that ordinary girls can find true love too!,"This delightful book has been without a doubt my favourite for ten years. I read it first when I was 8, and now as an 18 year old I feel it is an old friend. With its charming characters and appropriate ending, fans of classic fairy tales will like this book. So will any girl who ever doubted that ordinary-looking girls could find true love ! A fantastic gift for any young women in your life, and a refreshing twist on the typical Grimms brothers and Hans Christian Anderson!"
1,sandia neon nylon cat collars,"I bought three last week. These are not safe!!My cats caught them when grooming and the pulled threads cinched the collars so tight they choked them. We caught it when Trouble was just laying still and we checked the collar and it was so tight we couldn't get our finger under it, He was grooming and slowly pulled the nylon fiber threads which in turned tightened the collar to the point of choking him. Sandia Pet Products Neon Orange Cat Safety Collar - Adjustable 8 to 12 inchAlso the Adjustable belt slides making the collar either grow tight or loose.Do not buy!"
4,Great Battery,"I love my Samsung Pro815 camera and the battery life lasts forever. The battery lasts for sure as long as it says it does and I'm able to take well over the 450 pictures it says it will let you take on one charged battey. My only problem was the price,it's a little pricy, I have found replacement batteries that are much less expensive and I'm guessing will work just as well they just don't have the Samsung name on it. All and All I think though it was a samrt purchase."
3,Trashy but fun,"This book is not one that you will rave about to your friends but it tells a good enough story to keep you reading. It is actually more like 3 and a half stars.In a nutshell, three sisters (triplets!) are separated at birth after an act of betrayal by their uncle causes the death of their parents. Each of the girls grows up differently from the others and pursues an interesting career.We get to know each girl very well and we understand what drives them and how they each become successful at their chosen careers.Without revealing the ending, the girls do meet up and revenge is exacted against the uncle.This book is not fine literature but makes for an enjoyable enough read if you are stuck inside on a rainy day."
3,'The Spiritual dimension of the Enneagram',"In truth I'm still getting through this quite good read. It isn't an easy read however, and for me (not an academic or an expert on the Enneagram) its proved difficult to assimilate at times. Having said that I have found it interesting and informative, with great detail for each of the nine enneagramic numbers. Having read other books re. The Enneagram I particularly wanted the spiritual side of this remarkable 'tool' to be explored. The author certainly does this with good effect and I look forward to delving into the book more and more as I become familiar with the subject matter....alas for me that will take some time !"
5,Great Read,This book has a great perspective on different personalities and how they communicate and deal with life experiences. Very interesting to read.
1,Where is the Spirituality?,"This book is so negative about the aspects of the different types that it is painful to read. I will plod through it and see if there is anything of value since I purchased it, however, I ordered another book and found the free online test and information at [...] are gentler and in that way more helpful for me."
1,Don't get this book,"This is the most boring, redundantly repetitive, and negative book on the subject of the Enneagram. There are several better books to read on this subject."
1,"Confused Writer Writes Poorly, Not at All Compelling","I have read many Enneagream books, and this one is by far the worst. The author may have some knowledge of the system, perhaps a lot, but she does a poor job of showing it through writing, something which makes her a poor candidate for authoring a book on such a tricky subject as self exploration. Organization for each chapter describing personality types is nearly non-existent: Maitri wanders from observations to citations without a clear notion of where she's going, or what the Big Picture is. She loses herself and her reader in vague verbiage. This makes reading the book painful for longer than a paragraph.I strongly suggest the books of Helen Palmer, Don Riso and Russ Hudson, all lucid and rational writers who do their theory justice. What a waste of money, Maitri's ""The Spiritual Dimension of the Enneagram."""
1,Used,"I ordered a new book, but the one I received was very well used, with a lot of underlinings inside."
5,lucky luke,awesome it in english and everybody should at least try to watch a funny animated foreign movie and you won't regret it
4,Solid,"This is a pretty solid Bow Saw, would recommend it.Only complaint was with the protective cover on it, not always the easiest to work with, but I wasn't even expecting that to be with it, so I am just complaining about a non essential addition that was added on."
2,computer dust cover,The plastic is pretty cheap and the size for the computer was way too big. I don't know of many desk top computers now days that are that big! I would think the company would want to upgrade their materials used in these products. I'm not counting on it lasting very long and next time will look elsewhere for a cover ( or just use a towel to throw over it as I had been using!).
3,THINK LONG & HARD BEFORE BUYING,"My biggest complaint about this TV is that the manual sucks and you have to plug in your VCR connections in the front. You can use an S-Video cable in the back but that only works for using a DVD alone or only the DVD part of your VCR/DVD. If you have a combo VCR/DVD player like me then you have to run the cables from the back of the VCR/DVD to the front of the TV. So far I have spent an extra $40 on cables. No cables come with the TV. The picture is good, the sound is good."
3,Did not do her the justice she deserves,"I thought that the book, was much too small, they sugar coated the bad parts of her life,I dont think they realize what an important, significant, figure that Dottie West was in the history of country music. When is someone going to have enough common sence to induct her in the country music hall of fame? Dottie had consistantly good hits in the 60's, 70's, and 80's, had she not died she would have had hits in the 90's, I do not understand why the powers that be, choose to totally disreguard and disrespect such a true legend, she was not only an increadible vocalist and songwriter, but she put on one hell of a show. If you saw Dottie in concert you would never forget it, and by the way, did I forget to mention that she was one of the most beautiful, and glamorous, women of country music.She helped to make careers for many stars. Please give Dottie the recognition and respect that she deserves. Love Jeff Gibson, Dottie's #1 fan, forever!"
3,ALL-TOO BRIEF BIOGRAPHY.,"I'm English and not that familiar with Dottie West's life (she's virtually unknown in this country), but should like to add my thoughts, nevertheless.Firstly, I bought the book because I think she's incredibly talented, her voice 'gets through' to me like no one's ever has - and her life was not exactly dull! However, while I enjoyed the read, I feel there's still much to tell. Her divorces, for instance, were just skipped over - understandable, but not very enlightening.As for the reviewer who laments Dottie's omission from the Country Hall of Fame, well, obviously it's a travesty. However, in years to come, I feel sure she WILL be so honoured. In the meantime, we have the legacy of her beautiful voice & music to soothe and inspire us."
2,No details,The book was more like an outline of Dottie West's life. The wasn't any details or depth to the story.
4,My son was estatic,I ordered this for my 4 year old. He is obsessed with Jerry. We had a lot of fun with the costume for Halloween and he loves to wear it lounging around the house. The only reason I did not give the costume 5 stars is because the there is no way a 6 year old is this short. My son is 4 and the legs of the outfit kept riding up all night. He did not care but it did look a bit funny.
4,Cheap practical ear protection,"I got these for my eight year old daughter to wear when I have noisy power tools running. She likes them, and they cancel out a lot of sound. Her brother, who is usually closer to the action got full ear muffs. The earmuffs definitely cancel more sound, but are more expensive too. These earplugs are worth getting though for use when the noisy tool is across the room, not in your hands."
2,Not comfortable,"My wife and I each (independently) got these; neither of us find them comfortable enough to wear for long. They attenuate sound reasonably well, particularly higher frequencies. Voices are blocked less than I'd like, this meant it wasn't ideal for blocking out her TV watching, but the comfort was the real issue. I'm going back to the classic yellow earplugs, which I find much more comfortable."
5,good.,"I'm a Mechanic. You don't need to shove the plug in your ears. Just put it on your ears, and loud noise from impact gun will become a lot quieter.Don't have to touch the plug with your greasy hands."
4,Like for Trap shooting,"I wear electronic ear protectors when shooting pistols, but these are great for trap shooting. They don't hit the stock of the shotgun. Would buy again if these wear out. They come with an extra set of end plugs."
2,Not the item in the picture.,I was happy when I saw the ones in the picture. They have been hard to find in the stores where I live. When they came in the mail I was disapointed to find they are the orange ones with the foam inserts. Not what I thought I orderd. The hassel of returning them is the only reason I still have them.
1,"Waste of money, they hurt","Do not purchase these things.. They feel as if a vice is pressing them into your ear, and I couldn't imagine how they would feel to someone with a larger sized head. In my opinion it is much better to simple just use ear plugs(the ones you roll up and stuff in your ears)because not only do they protect you more (most reduce by 32 decibels if used properly), but they also wont leave you with a headache/pain when you take them off. I am very unhappy with these, and I hope you read this and dont make the same mistake I did by purchasing them."
1,It disappointed me,"The DVD is ok for the first 2 movies: Death Wish 2 and 3. But Death Wish 4, the audio goes out of sync after watching it for an hour."
2,Death Wish 4 has sound problems,"Death Wish 2 and 3 play just fine, but 4 has an audio sync problem during the last half of the movie. If you need Death Wish 2 or 3 for your collection, then this is still a good price for both. All three movies come on a single DVD. They are not separate discs."
4,3 PACK Good value,"I just received the Three death wish films on one DVD discAll three films have black borders on top and bottom of the image- it looks likes its widescreen.the image seem clear and crisp.I checked the audio and the sound is in sync with the action and actorsthere are no features. no subtitles no other languages.almost perfect. price is ok. It can be expensive if you buy the death wish films separately.For 7 I get death wish 2, 3 and 4.reasonable priceworth buying and viewing"
1,Bad copy,"all 3 of the films had trouble playing. freezing,and stopping. sounds overlap dialog. alot of the words didn't match what the actors were saying."
5,great collection,"These aren't the greatest or funniest movies ever created but they go well together in this package and for the low prices some of the sellers are giving this out for, it's one of the best movie deals ever. I got this collection for $6.11 total including shipping and handling. I would have paid that price for Team America alone."
5,Real answers to the issue of hate against the jews.,"Written in 1895,by a very respected jewish-french socialist writer this books vividly details the history of antisemitism from ancient times to the 19th century. It's narrative and descripton are essential for any serious interpretation of the eternal question of why the world has hated the jews so much. A question that sometimes has taken different form of unspoken prejudice and direct manifestation like the mass killing in the holocust.The strenght of the book lies in it's conclusions -that the jews are hated because they are always viewed as strangers- wich have outlasted the life of the auhtor to serve as a permanent remainder of how human beings can be guided by the wrong principles in their relationships with other human beings that may seem to be different because of their values and religion."
5,Awesome toy,"These toy Dinosaurs are extremly realistic and indestructable. They go from sand box to play room after a rinse with the hose. One left near a hedge in the yard overnight gave our neighbor quite a start!The kids just love them.Excellent value, something they will be able to use years from now for school projects."
4,Looks nicer than the photo,"My son picked this as his prize for doing well at school. He loves it. In the photo it seems that the coloring is a bit blotchy but in actuality, the red/orange and black stripes are vivid. The legs are a bit too much forward so that Rex easily falls over but it does stand on its own."
5,Concise guide to the scientific base of major herbal drugs,"Very outstanding among the books on chinese herbs written in English (to be fair, many better books in Chinese exist but not well translated!)Starting from the chemistry and ending with the toxicology, each important herbs included are presented in a well-balanced format; the therapeutic values are thus projected clearly on the empirical grounds.The new edition is an updated gist of those related scientific works done but could not be tracked on the great MedLine due to the language barrier."
2,"Not worth the money, Nothing you cannot find on pubmed.com",I'm shipping this book back. It isn't worth the price tag given the info it provides. It is basically a regurjitation of pubmed.com research and abstracts. In fact with some of the entries I can almost read verbatim the abstract that it references. (In general I find CRC press books too pricey)
4,Pianistic punctuality,"The memorability factor does recede in relation to the track listing, but remains crisply conceived throughout."
2,not very impressive,"The word usage was good, not ab ad writer, but some facts were way out of truth, like how he describes kurt ""and did so much damage to his head hat police could only identify his body through fingerprints. dental records were no use because nothing was left of his mouth"" that is total bs. there was no exit wound, and hardly any blood. his head was clearly not ""blown off"" and there was hardly ANY damage to his head.. that upsetted me.. its an insult to kurt's memory"
3,Dead almost 8 years now.....,"Much like Lennon, Hendrix, and Morrison, the ghost of Kurt Cobain has probably learned that there really is no bigger business in entertainment than an untimely demise. This dossier gathers together 22 articles from British and American magazines on the man, his band and his wife, each recounting the overly familiar story of grunge, drugs, stomach pains and shotguns. While often engrossing stuff, much here dwells on post-suicide events, making this not only morbid, but sometimes repetetive reading."
5,Worth the price,"Worth the price. accurate, I have beeng using it for long now and is very accurate. The design, feel and texture are also very good and looks very professional."
5,Great Value,"I wanted a good compass for a reasonable price and this compass is perfect for me. Unlike my previous experience with compasses, it is very easy to use. I was impressed with how rugged the case is. This compass will come with me on all my hikes."
1,Shows wrong directions,"The compass does not show the right directions. It is terrible, you can't trust this compass and don't. Unfortunately, I am not able to return it since I don't live in us. I am considering it to be repaired, If it is possible (I don't know yet.Even Military Prismatic Sighting Compass is better than this, at least it is functioning properly"
5,A Gift,My husband is very happy with the compass. He will use it in fine finish carpentry installations. Great buy. Thanks!
5,"Well built, tough,accurate, buy it ........","Well built, accurate compass for those times when the batteries in your GPS are dead, or you just want to bushwhack old school. Leave the GPS at home, then try to find the shortcut through your favorite swamp or forest using this tough and user friendly navigation tool. If you get lost, blame it on Darwinism, not the Silva Lensatic 360 you should have with you !!! };>{>"
4,Solid,"Points north, yes. Built pretty solid, and I've kept it in my everyday use backpack for weeks and there's no bubbles or problems."
2,passed on to grandchild,I was not able to see well enough to use this compass; directions confused me; not for senior citizen like myself
4,It works,"It works, it seems like it will hold up decently if you don't abuse it much. I bought it for my in case of emergency bag. I think it will work fine for that."
1,Consciosness,"I could not get past the first 15 min. of this !!!, it was such a waste of money,,,,our bodies were designed as space suits to get us around on different planets,,,, good lord!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,Excitement? What excitement?,"This book misses. It ends up as a rather dry recitation of events that happened to impact World Cup bridge matches. There is not enough information on bidding systems or hand analysis to make it interesting the the technical player, and there is not enough gossip to make it interesting to the merely curious. And, alas, it is not funny. Find a differnt book."
4,The only think I didn't like was the slant.,"This book was great in that it had great information on the war, which it often gave from the soldiers' perspective. The photos were excellent, and the book would've been better with even more photos. The only real problem I had with the book (really the whole series) was the left-wing slant it contained. This particular volume devotes entirely too much space to the incident at My Lai. There was much more going on in Vietnam than My Lai, so in that sense it lacked balance. All in all, this was a good book."
4,Donkeys rule,An excellent recording that I purchased to replace an older and worn out CD. I was glad that Amazon still had it available for purchase.
3,CD box is adequate but overpriced,"The Fellowes CD File does a good job of storing many CD's and DVD's. However, when it is full, it is difficult to latch and the weight can make the box distort its shape if you aren't careful picking it up. Several times the front latch has come off, but I have been able to put it back on. The box only comes with 25 sleeves, so you have to buy fairly expensive refills. The sleeves will hold the inserts from regular CD cases, but I have had to trim some of them down to fit. Of course DVD inserts are too large. This CD File is a good size, since it holds many discs, yet fits in drawers and on shelves. However, it costs over $20 by the time you add shipping, which seems a bit steep for a plastic box."
2,Not good enough,My cd sleeve was kinda flimsy. It should also have a handle to pull it from a shelf. If you handle it wrong the cover twists and you have to try to slide it from a shelf and straighten the cover.
2,Top Notch CD/DVD Storage,"It is sturdy, well made and has the virture of using the double sided sleeves that permit a narrow but sufficient label at the top.In fact with a printer you can use labels that allow a alphanumeric filing code and brief description. You do have to cut the printed labels and fit them to the narrow strips for inserting at the top.So, much like a filing cabinet, you can look down the length of the ""Trabinet"" I call it to find the specific CD you are looking for.This makes for quick and convenient access to your media.My only reservation is that you can stack only one on top of another. But that is about as far as you can go.So I give it a 4.5 rating.Rod Edington"
4,"Thick, Sturdy Wipes that Pop Out Right","I'd give this soft, generous wipes a resounding five stars, but they aren't quite hypoallergenically up to snuff. I keep baby wipes in both my bathroom and my car. These particular wipes I must use with caution; they tend to break out my sensitive skin. And I'm no little baby!I've found that Pampers Sensitive Skin Wipes are not quite as irritating. Shame they aren't as thick and cushy as these Huggies."
3,Good quality diaper wipe,"These diaper wipes are good and strong with just the right amount of moisture to clean off the mess. One big negative however is that there are so many plastic tubs to throw out / re-cycle. It seems like such a waste of plastic to throw out so many tubs rather than just re-fill them. I'd buy the wipe re-fills if only Amazon would include the re-fills in the ""subscribe and save"" program..."
3,"Not the best price for the item, but the wipes are fine.","These Huggies wipes are soft, strong and unscented as advertised. However, you get 8 plastic containers of the wipe at almost $3.50 per container. Babies R Us sell the same item (non-sale for $2.99/box), and Walmart is even cheaper. If you buy the refill packets, you drop the price per wipe even more. Buy these wipe at your local retailer."
3,just ok,"I agree in parts with many of the reviewers here. 1. The wipes are not as soft as the other brands, wish some of the other brands were available with ""subscribe and save"" too. 2. Don't want to keep throwing away plastic tubs! Though it was my fault that I didnt read the description in full. I wouldnt have purchased there had I known this before. 3. Though they appear to be thick, they did tear a few times."
4,Cloud??,"My children LOVE the wild kratts shows, and they are very informational with good values displayed. My only issue is why do I have to have internet if I paid for all the videos. I mean, if I buy a movie for home, I can play it whenever without internet...HMMM"
2,Great concept but...,I like their other show format better.This one has interesting plots but they get a bit heavy handed with the villains of the story opting for unnecessarily dark themes--too harsh for young kids.It's a shame because my son graduated from Zooboomafoo and we wanted him to get more from this show.
4,cowgirl outfit,"I ordered several of these outfits for my granddaughters at Christmas time. The girls were thrilled with their outfits and so was I. I particularly liked the material and color and the fact that the hat was included. Again, I was very happy with my choice,"
2,Pink Cowgirl Costume was overpriced and poor quality,"This outfit is cute, but the quality is poor. At most this should be priced at $10 - $15. The hat is a piece of limp synthetic material that was so flimsy it was folded into a flat box about 1 inch high, along with the vest and skirt. Needless to say, it didn't even remotely resemble a hat in appearance. The hat was so pathetic, I bought another, beautiful hat on line, for $12.95, to replace it. The vest and skirt are made to fit children ages 3 - 7, which means that the waist is huge for a 3-year old and the length is very short for a 7-year old. The synthetic material used for is more like plastic than fabric. However, my 5-year old granddaughter does enjoy the outfit."
3,Cowgirl Christmas,"I ordered this for my granddaughter as a Christmas present. It looks so cute in the ad but when it came in, it was made like a halloween costume. I thought for the price it would have been a little bit better quality. When my granddaughter put it on, it did look very cute on her. So I guess I have mixed emotions about this item. One good thing...I ordered it on Dec. 15 and they said it would be received Dec. 26 and my heart sank, as I needed it for Christmas, it came in 3 days later. I was relieved!"
3,Only because...,"Eric's music is 10 times better live than it is on record (expecially vocals). Ive seen him enough, along with opening for steve vai in Houston, and he is an **INCREDIBLE** guitarist especially slide so be wary of the last reviewer. But I do have to agree his full potential isnt dealt forth in the album- not enough blues with a rock base, lacking power in voice, but look for Eric to fix his studio woes in his next album"
4,The Future is NOW !!,"""Blues Purists"" be damned,,,,,,crawl back under your Rock with your scratchy old 78's.Eric can play alongside the best of them.You don't tour with Steve Vai unless you're one of the Best.Eric is the Future of Modern Blues.The latest cd is more Aggresive than the previous 2 offerings.A little Harsh at times but the ""Bluesy"" undertones are there.This cd is Highly Recommended."
3,Not the Blues,Eric's 3rd album isn't up to par with his first 2 releases. He's gone from hard blues rock to pop/rock. Maybe 2 good cuts on this album. Buy Devil's Train if you don't have any of his releases or better yet see him live. He is the real deal. And what's up with his hair?
1,Cliche Blues album.....Rubbish,"This album is too cliche. Its just a very very generic blues album. Boring is the best word that describes his music. I think he's a cool guy but man, come on! This album is just a wannabe and it spits it out in full force.....I would recommend him to do better.Highlight of this album: Steve Vai's got another pet."
4,good writer - book could have been better,"At times I loved the writing. Plenty of great, amazing, 17th century adventure stories. It got hard to keep track of the characters. He fails to step back often enough and remind the reader of the broader patterns. In fact, I'm not sure he sees them himself. Plenty of material on British insensitive arrogance. Page 308 f is a hilarious story. I was unaware of how the French and British jostled for power in India in the 1700s. It would have been better with more maps and illustrations inserted at appropriate places. See page 424 for unfair cynicism. Much mockery of the company and its leaders. The title of the book is itself a mockery. This book is a reaction against the older, hero-oriented British imperial histories."
3,seeks an alternative,"Has faithfully laboured,to bring alive this remarkable enterprise with colours flying.Be warned, Keay crams his story with extensive quotes from the archives, and that in italics, so bring a magnifying glass,and be prepared to do a little re-reading. My copy refers to a paperback.The hardcover may be kinder to the eye.This book assumes you are familiar with Indian geography.As such to me who does not the book simply goes begging for accompanying topographic maps,and I would advise anyone considering giving it a read to get some."
3,slow but worth it,"This is, of course, a history or chronicle of the East India Company and its role in the India of the British Empire. It is hugely researched, scholarly, as far as I know, and quite well written. I have enjoyed ever minute of my reading, but it has taken me weeks. It is slow going. This is due partially to an over concentration on the details of maritime commerce and use of too many technial ship terms. The narrative is unavoidably anecdotal, and it sometimes becomes tedious. The author wisely lightens this up with some glimpses (also anecdotal)into the real lives of the actors, and then the book gets more compelling.For those who like history and have any interest in the economic development of the early modern period, this is the book for them. I'm glad I bought it."
3,Interesting,I was interested in learning about the UK's earliest travels to India and beyond and this book certainly was informative. I thought the author went into an overly exhaustive explanation of some things and he seemed to re-visit certain periods over and over but all in all it was interesting and I'm glad I bought the book. If you're looking for more of a brief overview of this era this is not the book for you.
4,care bears school,very cute school very durable but wait till you find it on sale very over priced. Cute toy but over priced
4,A good guide,"James Joyce's A PORTRAIT OF THE ARTIST AS A YOUNG MAN is arguably one of the defining works of 20th century modernism. It set the standard that many writers who employed stream of consciousness narration (Woolf, Faulkner, et al.) would follow. This collection of essays is a good way to familiarize yourself, not only with the novel, but with the Joycean scholarship that followed. Some essays are better than others: Ellman's stands out as particularly good. Some essays drag. Still, I would recommend this to anyone embarking on ""A Portrait""."
1,Poor manufacturing quality or even a fake?,"IMPORTANT: This review is related to the manufacturing quality of thedelivered CD. It is NOT related to the music!I ordered this CD from Amazon.com since it isn't available in Germany.It seems to me like a fake or at least like a very poor reissue of theoriginal recording. The cover does not look like it is depicted on theAmazon.com website. It actually looks like being printed by my ten yearsold ink jet printer. The most annoying thing is the ""booklet"" which isactually only a piece of paper. It does not even contain the assignmentof composers to the individual music pieces, i.e., you have to guess whichwork was composed by whom.I was really disappointed when I received this CD after waiting for almostone month.Thumbs down for Amazon.com! Even if it is not a fake they should at leastput a remark on their website in case they're selling poor reissues."
4,Fascinating and visually atractive book,"I've always been fascinated by ship wrecks, they are very romantic to me. Quiet, forever buried in the sea, reminiscent of times long past... This book really compliments these romantic ideas. It is full of beautiful large pictures of ships and plains from interesting points of view. The book covers about 45 wracks, surprisingliy though, not the RMS Titanic! That was a bit of a disapointment as my fascination started when the movie Titanic came out and I began to read about it.Focus is on the background of the wreck, why it sank, which is described in detail most of the time. Beside this, the book also offers a divers' guide for professional divers who want to explore the ships for themselves. I didn't find that info useful as I'm not a diver, but I'm sure it will be useful for divers. Definitely a worthy book!"
3,Pretty Pictures,"A book of very nice pictures.Not for actual divers, though, too many inaccuracies and some bad info that could lead to trouble.Buy it for the pics, not the facts.That said, it then becomes a rather expensive picture book."
4,UN BUEN TCHAIKOVSKY,"La interpretación de la cuarta Sinfonía de Tchaikovsky, por la orquesta de Chicago bajo la dirección del Maestro Claudio Abbado, está llena de hermosos colores orquestales bajo una concepción correcta de la obra, no hay detalle que le falte, todo en su lugar. Buen sonido de Sony, la orquesta responde a la altura de sus antecedentes. Para los más exigentes versiones mejor logradas que esta, son las de Karajan con Berlín o con Viena, igual que la famosa versión de Leonard Bernstein de 1.958 con la New York Philarmonic, ahora disponible en Sony en la edición ""El siglo de Bernstein"". Un buen Tchaikovsky de Abbado tanto en la Sinfonía como en el Romeo y Julieta.Francisco J. Muñoz"
5,"Chicken Helper, Jambalaya",The Jambalaya mix is a very tasty meal. It is wonderful by taste and a easy fast meal to make. Great product.
3,"great book for adults, but for children?","this is a fantastic book with superb illustrations. but its a little wordy and a little over the head of my young kids. too philosophical for the target age. you cant beat dr seuss, a genius i really appreciate now that I have kids. The Lorax rules! Go Horton! I hear you Sam I Am! Gimme some o' dem green eggs."
1,Rip-Off,"This is pathetic. It's a complete rip-off of a very good animated film entitled ""The Point"", created in 1971, with music by Harry Nilsson. If you're going to write a children's story, get an original idea."
2,Not good but not bad either,There are about 3 good songs on this CD and the rest are pretty bland or simply annoying.My friends all wanted to see this musical but now after hearing the songs I have no ambition to pay the $90 ticket price to see it on Broadway and hope someday they'll just make a movie.
2,big let down,"After reading all the top reviews this soundtrack recieved, I was sure I was in for a treat. I just needed to share the fact that it's not universally liked. All of the songs sound similar and it frankly gets a little boring after a while. The lyrics aren't as cutting edge as I thought they would be. I did chuckle a few times, but overall I wasn't as amused as I was lead to believe I would be. This soundtrack should NOT be compared to Rent, as it is not even in the same leauge. The only similarity to Rent is that they are both broadway musicals and both take place in New York city. I'm sure the live show is spectacular, but I am sorry I bought the soundtrack."
1,This makes me sick,"Watching the 2004 Tony Awards, I have to say I was whole-heartedly rooting for ""Wicked"" to win best musical...and still think that it completely deserved it. But seeing that Avenue Q won, I thought it must have been completely amazing to win over Wicked. And after listening to the recording, I was perfectly appaled at the shallowness, profanity, and degrading nature of Avenue Q. I am a firm believer in the power of theatre, but Avenue Q really upset me. It doesn't tug at any heart strings, it doesn't inspire any emotions, and really isn't humorous unless you enjoy things like puppet sex, porn, homosexuality, and all those wonderful things. I would've given it zero stars, but it wouldn't let me."
5,"Catchy, fun.","No one will ever mistake this for Camelot, South Pacific, etc. But if you're in the right frame of mind, this is one of the most enjoyable musical OCRs on the market.The lyrics are clever and honest - sometimes a little too honest (""The Internet is For Porn"").The tunes have a Sesame Street-esque hummability, and it's just a fun CD.Standouts are D'Abruzzo's ""Fine, Fine Line"" and the Cast's finale, ""For Now"".If you've ever been broke and unemployed and turning 33, this recording is for you."
5,It doesn't suck to be me!,I got this cd awhile ago and love it! The songs are witty and hilarious. I think to truly understand Avenue Q you have to see the show but it is still a great cd. The performances by John Tartaglia and Stephanie D' Abruzzo are delightful. Keep in mind that you have to have a certain sense of humor to truly enjoy this cd(some may find it offensive) but if you're like me you will love it!
4,Love it!,"I actually found this soundtrack through AccuRadio ... and I absolutely love it! It's funny, it's irreverent, and it is subtly thought-provoking. The songs are addictive (with the exception of one or two), sometimes TOO addictive.. my husband breaks into ""Internet"" at the oddest times. All in all I definately recommend it."
5,Avenue Q,"What a fabulous soundtrack! It is so refreshing to listen to something that isn't full of corny ballads and love songs. Not that Avenue Q doesn't have those, but they just fit perfectly. Sesame Street for the grown up scene. It's wonderful. Such a talented cast and design crew! I fully reccomend this to any Broadway lover!"
4,A very funny little show,"From ""It Sucks To Be Me"" through ""If You Were Gay,"" ""Everyone's A Little Bit Racist"" and ""The Internet Is For Porn"" - one great number after another. I tip my hat to composers Robert Lopez and Jeff Marx for coming up with this utterly disarming, witty and raunchy little gem - easily the most original new show on Broadway since ""Urinetown: The Musical."" A treat."
2,"Mind your P's and ""Q""'s","I guess you must have to see this show in order to appreciate it, as it doesn't translate well to just the score. Personally I find the thought of muppets having sex rather disturbing. I enjoyed some of them like ""The More You Ruv Someone"", ""Everyone's a little bit racist"" and the amusing ""The Internet Is For Porn."" BUT this show just gets old after a while. I don't see how this could get an award for ""Original"" score. It's not original--it's based off ""Sesame Street."" Even the character's voices are nearly identical making it even more disturbing. If you want a better score (which should have won the Tony) that deals with homosexuality and other aspects of society check out Boy George's ""Taboo."" ""Avenue Q"" just is NOT worth the money. Sorry if I o ffended anyone who likes this show."
3,"Fun Show, Cute Score","Avenue Q was a fun show, with a cute score, but is in no way comparable to ""Wicked"", the season's other musical hit (and who should have won Best Musical).There are a couple of great songs, namely ""What Do You Get With A B.A. In English/It Sucks To Be Me"" and ""There's A Fine, Fine Line"", but most are cute only in the context of seeing the show.Overall, the cd is fun (and worth the buy), but does not generate the desire for repeated listenings.""Wicked"", ""Hairspray"", ""Dirty Rotten Scoundrels"" and ""The Producers"" are better examples of great ""recent"" scores."
2,Letter Grade: Q,"I'm basing my review on both the CD and having seen the show. The performers have a great deal of energy and talent and some of the lyrics are very clever. However, I find nothing memorable about the music. The CD and show start with some good lessons in life expressed in a comical way, but in my opinion it's unnecessary to move into offensive topics and lyrics to get this across. Maybe I'm old-fashioned but I prefer songs that both my children and parents can listen to. On a grading scale from A (the best) to Z, I give this a Q."
5,Got what I wanted,"A fun CD, and was exactly as advertised. Got just what I wanted, the price was right and enjoying it immensely. I recommend looking into Amazon 'used' books and CDs. They can be an excellent deal, even with shipping costs much cheaper than new and no real difference."
4,"Vulgar, Offensive, and AWESOME!","Not for the feint of heart, this show is for those who enjoy the humor of Adult Swim and South Park. It's a lot of fun. Imagine if you will Sesame Street for grownups."
5,"""Sesame Street"" Meets ""South Park""","I own several albums of various Broadway shows, but this one has to be one of my favorites. I can't stop giggling every time I listen to it. The lyrics are witty and the score will get stuck in your head. Word of warning to those of your with kids--this is NOT a musical for children. That parental advisory sticker is there for a reason, and if you choose to ignore it then don't complain. You were warned. Other than that, the sound quality is amazing and so is the cast."
5,This CD Helps,"I am a retired nurse who lives a lonely life in the mountains. I came across this CD when I found a bag someone had left at church. I must say I found it very entertaining, and I like to listen to this CD while sitting by the window, watching the snow, rain, or sun, depending on the weather. It helps through the lonely times. I think my nephew would enjoy it, if I knew where he was. From Sarah"
4,"Avenue Q-Explaining life for Teens, even if it ain't pretty","I've been a performer since the age of seven and now I'm a freshman in high school. I love the Avenue Q soundtrack, but it's not without its flaws. It's a comedic, witty take on life's blunter realizations, and it doesn't hide facts like guys use the internet for porn or that everyone has racial prejudice, and it makes the issues understandable. However, it is NOT geared toward children. Explicit content about sex and language (Gary Coleman is the superintendent...you do the math) may be too much for younger than high-school age kids, and even then parents should use discretion.However, if you can get past those troubles, the play is highly enjoyable! Amazing talent brings the puppets to life, and the songs are hilarious, addressing real issues comically without glossing them over. Avenue Q shows us that life isn't perfect...but that's the fun."
4,"A Nice Place To Visit, But You Can't Live Here","Avenue Q adresses issues in a way we can all understand. So what if there's a gay puppet? That's not what the show is all about, if I may dispel the rumor. Each of the characters go through some tough ordeals, even if it is really, really funny at times. The songs posses sharp wit and hey, Everyone IS a Little Bit Racist, so stop denying it. This a great track if you are at least, hmm, let's try thirteen years old. You will be laughing out loud and then singing along with the song. Who says a puppet show can't be a Tony winner?"
3,Nice but must see live...,"I saw the show this weekend with friends and absolutely LOVED IT!!!!! It was brillantly done and an excellant experience.We bought the CD at the show and I sorry to say I'm disappointed. Some key lines from the show aren't on the CD....and the magic just isn't there with out the visuals for songs such as ""Internet is for Porn"". Great overall but really receommend catching the show live."
5,Genuinely Funny!!,"I heard this CD for the first time in my friends car after I told him I had never heard it before. From ""BA in English"" on I was hooked. I thought this was the funniest thing I had heard since Spamalot, and I went and bought the CD that afternoon. For me, this was an instant classic. Besides all the funny songs, thier are also some very pretty, and sometimes touching ballads that make this a balanced musical experience. I am not going to say I love every track, there are a couple I skip over most of the time. But I would most definately reccomend this musical to someone who is not easily offended and is willing to laugh at the world we live in. But heed the parental advisory sticker, this is not a show for kids."
1,WOW.,"Has broadway really stooped so low?? How can this trash even be shown in the same theatre as the infamous Phantom of the Opera? What a disgrace! Shame on broadway. Get this show off broadway as soon as possible, please! And for those of you who actually bought a ticket to this garbage for a couple good laughs comparable to those of Austin Powers, shame on you too! But it's not too late..DON'T purchase this disgusting CD! Go see Les Miserables instead. Now that is some real broadway."
1,1 star is being kind!,This musical is pointless!! It is a horrible musical revolving around puppets! LAME!!!! It is a wast of money! I Broke mine in half in disgust!
1,Horrible. Disgusting,"This is the trashiest musical (excuse me, I don't even consider it a musical) that has ever been put out. It should be destroyed and burned. It is downright disgusting and horrible and any civilized person would not listen to such garbage. I would have given it -5 stars, but it wouldn't let me give below a one (and it doesn't deserve it.)"
3,Great if you are older than 17 and you can't get tickets to the musical,"I bought the cd for my daughter before we went to see the musical, to get an idea of what it was about. It is funny, and I don't recommend it for anyone under the age of 17, but it is funny."
3,"Meh, Wicked's better.","Avenue Q is sort of like the Pop/Punk band Blink 182. Gross out lyrics that inspire a ""ewww"", then after a few listens, a guilty smirk, then a few mor listens and your roaring with laughter.It's alright. But there are better musicals out there. Mainly; Newsies, Hairspray, The Producers, Hairspray, Urinetown.AND of course, Wicked.I still CANNOT believe that Avenue Q beat Wicked at the Tony's.That is the biggest outrage since....well, it was HUGE.Wicked should have, no, deserved to win.Oh well, the people who decided are obviously out of their minds."
3,Eh...good for a chuckle...,"I bought it because it won at the Tony Awards. I figured it had to be wonderful. And it's alright. Definitely very juvenile humor. Which isn't a slam. I chuckled. It was probably worth the purchase just for the song ""What do you do with a BA in English."" If that's not the actual title, it's close enough. As an English major who struggled to ""find myself"" after college, I appreciated the sentiment.I can't say it blew me away. I think I enjoy a more serious and adult musical. Even that comes out wrong because this one is very much ""adult."" This is the only CD in my entire collection that I will hide from my young nieces. Heh. Maybe I should say I enjoy a more serious and dramatic musical.This one will give you a chuckle if you don't mind the irreverent and often off-color humor. In the right mood, I enjoy it."
1,"So bad, I'd prefer to give it zero stars","Wow, I don't know when I have heard such bad singing. This sounds like a grown-up version of Sesame Street. I am not one of those boring people with no sense of humor... I promise. But I fail to see the humor in this musical. Bad writing and bad singing combine to make a work that is seriously appalling in its lack of skill and talent. I don't even know why I am bothering to rate this."
5,"Delightful, Fun Musical Comedy for Adults","I saw the fun production number, ""Its Sucks to Be Me"" on the Tony's and then bought the CD. It's infectious and every song is delightful to listen too. The song ""If You Were Gay"" is also a big winner, if not for it's clever lyrics and positive message from puppets! This musical reminds me of the original off broadway cast recording of ""You're a Good Man Charlie Brown!"" from 1967 updated for 2004 with a Sesame Street, but adult oriented twist.The CD should grow substantially in popularity among college students and adults as the musical heads to Las Vegas as a must see to open in addition to the NY show. Great multi-talented cast whose ample voices resemble different characters from your favorite kid shows on PBS and Gary Coleman of Different Strokes."
5,"Catchy, subversive and down right mean. Love it.","I didn't expect much going into Avenue Q. In fact, I only saw it because I had season tickets. And boy am I glad I did. Avenue was one of the best theatrical productions I have seen years. The strength of the show the muscis which reflected the spirit of the show: catchy, subversive and sometimes downright mean(here's looking at you, Gary Coleman). Love it. This soundtrack makes porn, racision and malice fun. Don't listen to this for the first time while you are drinking. If you do, your beverage will be coming out of your nose. You have been warned."
4,Excellent and extremely funny,"I haven't seen the show but the CD and what I saw on this years Tonys was really funny and clever. And while I don't think it deserved all the Tonys it won I can see why it did win them.Avenue Q is something different and very surprising to those expectiong some kind of cutesy puppet show.Discussing and singing about issues like homesexuality, porn, racisism and love all with puppets is quite creative and very funny.I'd have to say the songs I like the most are:1.The Internet is For Porn2.If you were Gay3.Everyone's a little bit racist4.Fantasies come trueVery clever and funny, but they aren't kidding when they say explicit lyrics....puppets having sex and some strong swearing is on this CD. The reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because the music is very repetative and many of the songs just don't seem to have much originality and get boring. Special and There is Life Outside Your Apartment being two of the most boring and reptetitve or pointless songs..."
4,Great Toy - Terrible Price,This is a great toy but be sure to check out your local (chain) toy store before buying it here. The same product is available locally for less than half the price shown on Amazon. It's a really fun toy but buyer beware of prices!
3,Good SECOND place to start....,"For me, as a novice of Vedic Astrology, this one was a bit heavy as a place to start my studies. With that said, Vedic astrology is an amazingly complex system...After reading Beneath a Vedic Sky, this one by Behari was a very helpful, natural next step. He does not write it for the Western mind and leaves out things that, as a Westerner, I didn't know. I have found that Beneath a Vedic Sky and this one have been very complimentary to each other.Beneath A Vedic Sky"
4,Well Organised contents,The book is well organised in terms of explaining the Vedic houses/Planets etc. The concept of each house is explained very well and its connection with the other houses. The philosophical explanation is really good but takes time to understand. You have to read carefully few times. I wud say the language is bit more difficult side and the author cud have used simple language. This (language) is the only negative point I find in this book.Otherwise the book is Fantastic for the beginers as it tries to explain the Vedic astrology concepts in a very deep theoratical way. I really liked this book and it gave me a different dimension to my understanding of Vedic Astrology. I wud say that this book is a good start.
1,Trash Can Stuff,The author has no capacity of writing anythingwhich makes sense from one sentence to the next.Just boring wordplay. Better to read a novel.Definitely no knowledge here. Can't squeezeblood from a stone.This is the kind of baloney which makeswords like Vedic. Astrology & Spiritualitysuffer.
5,Quick find-great price,"I couldn't find this product locally and wanted to re-vamp my home office. I thought, my last resort is to check online and I went to Amazon. I found my product within seconds, ordered it, and it shipped out immediately for significantly less money than I had paid in the past. Thanks Amazon.Barb in Norwalk, CT"
5,Specialty Tools,"Like any specialized task, you need the proper tool to do the job. A.S.T. is the specialty tool king. These adapters are the best in the industry. It sucks that car manufacturers do this to us mechanics, forcing us to buy specialty tools in order to service thier ""special"" vehicles. Assenmacher is the industry leader in specialty tools, and if they don't make it; then they probably will based on technicians' feedback."
3,"Great C.D. Looking for a particular song, though....","Overall, a great c.d. but what is the name of that song that is at the end of the movie when Jim and Michelle dance their first dance? It's by a guy and sounds like an older song but I am not sure on that. It is a very pretty song, and I would like to find it. Any help?"
3,stifflers flower song,"To the guy who was asking what the song was when Stiffler was going home and stopped at the flower shop after ruining the flowers for the wedding: Yeah, its Sum 41's Hell Song. It's definitely not the Laid remake of the song by James. That song is at the beginning and end of the movie."
2,"Mediocre, at best","This was one of those, ""I just got it for one song"" purchases, and thought afterwards, ""I should've just gotten the MP3 of the song instead"". Oh, wait a minute, that's why I got it. Itunes didn't have an MP3 for it!"
4,Great CD.,Great CD with a nice range of music straight from the movie. I keep it in my car and haven't gotten sick of it yet.
4,Norah Jones Song,"The name of the song from Norah Jones is called ""The Long Day is Over"". I'm interested in knowing which song was playing when the two are walking on the beach together before the big day and after the flowers were ruined. Thanks!"
3,Whats that song?,"The song that is playing while stiffler is driving through the town at night, right after he killed all the flowers, what is that song playing in the background?"
5,excellent CD,"For all those wondering about that Norah Jones ballad in the movie it's Come Away With Me- which can only be purchased as a single at this time. Although, I purchased the American Wedding Soundtrack on the premise of obtaining this one song, I was not disappointed. This soundtrack itself is the best compilation CD of 2003... only 2-3 songs sucked, but it was definitely worth buying."
3,what your looking for....,"nightdeathloveli.. the song you are looking for is matt nathanson - laid, its on the soundtrack :o) x"
4,Still looking,"i hope this will be helpful. the song on the beach part was honey and the stars, and the one they danced to at the end was Van Morisson's version of Into the Mystic, which was quite good too, though wasnt on the sountrack, anyway im still looking for the song played when the football team was fixing stuff for the wedding. hope anyone could help me with that thanks."
5,BACHOLAR PARTY SONG,"I want to know if anyone knows the song when the strippers are coming into the room during the beginning of the bacholar party. Its a rap song. Baha men does not have a song ""summertime girls"" so I know its not that song..."
3,Dance Club Songs,"It's a shame that not every song played in the movie could be on the soundtrack, like the ones played in the gay bar scene, for those who liked those songs but don't know their names here it is:michael sambello - maniacbelinda carlisle - heaven is a place on eartheurythmics - sweet dreamsbananarama - she's got itduran duran - the reflex"
2,My gypsy soul has been rocked!,"""Into the Mystic"" is by far the highlight of the CD! I can't stop listening to it - thus I can't accurately comment on the rest of it. If you like track 17 be sure to check out the Wallflower's latest album, ""Red Letter Days."" I highly recommend it."
3,Let your soul and spirit fly...,"The Wallflowers' cover of ""Into the Mystic"" is well worth the price! And if you think ""Calling You"" and ""Honey & the Moon"" are two of the sweetest songs ever you should definitely listen to the the Wallflowers' latest single, ""Closer to You."""
2,Laid,"Someone asked about the ""when you coming home"" song in the trailer..It's called ""Laid"" and the version in the the trailer is the original by the imcomparable English band James. The soundtrack features a different version by Matt Nathanson that is essentially as close to the same exact thing as the James version as possible. Why do a cover unless your're going to change it a bit?"
2,"Mediocre, at best","In my opinion, a lot of the music just doesn't fit with the plot of the movie. Had this been American Pie or American Pie 2, your Good Charlotte's, Avril Lavigne's, and other pop-punk that seems to be dominating the airwaves would have fit perfectly, maybe, but honestly, some of the songs really were just thrown in and really didn't fit with the scenes. The people behind advertising were greatly going for sales. I thought that American Pie 2 had great music in the background. Full of a mixture of known and not-so known artists, but the music was quality for what it was. I think the greatest music is the more adult music. Your Joseph Arthur, Wallflowers , Matt Nathanson cover, Norah Jones, etc. fits perfectly with the whole growing, marriage vibe that's demonstrated in the beginning and end of the movie. This is not worth the $14-$15 I would probably pay for this. If you like the pop-punk stuff, get this. It's probably for you, otherwise, don't bother."
4,A nice mix of songs from the movie,"I had previously purchased the ""American Pie 2"" soundtrack and was very disappointed. The songs on the cd were by the same bands in the movie but not the tracks heard in the film. This cd was a pleasant suprise. The songs are the ones from the movie and there is a great mixture of genres and bands on this cd. I was very pleased with this soundtrack, because I mean hey, that's why people buy a soundtrack because they like the songs from the film, right? =)"
4,Tons of fun with Punk songs,I haven't seen the movie yet but the cd is awesome. My favorite song is Art of Losing by American Hi-fi. Buy this cd bc it will rock you sox.
3,Missing?,I loved all of the American Pie movies and the soundtracks r amazin but i was dissapointed to find the collage of all the great songs when stifler is dancing in the bar was not on the cd! still gr8 tho but only gets 3 stars bcoz the mix of all those songs was amazin!!
2,I Cant Find This One Song,"i cant find the name of that one song they played in this movie just before the credits when they were showing everyone all happy and everything. it was definetly after ""into the mystic"" and before ""bouncing off the walls"". they played it when they showed the couples dancing, and i think it maybe went a little bit into the scene with the mom in the bathtub. i rly liked it and they played like a second of it but i cant find the name. help me out if anyones got the movie and is a music buff or anyone who just happens to know the name of the song.."
3,Norah Jones??,What was the Norah Jones song that was in the movie??? And WHY isn't it on the CD.. Someone please post the name of the song!Thanks!

3,Can someone help with a song title???,I keep seeing the commercial for this DVD (American Wedding) on TV and I see it on our local cable preview channel saying when this movie will be on. During both the commercial and the stuff on cable there is a song playing in the backround. Does anyone know the name of it and who the artist is? If I remember right it's the same song played during the final credits of the movie. A friend of mine was over when I saw the commercial and he thought it was the Flaming Lips but I don't see that song on the soundtrack. CAN ANYONE HELP???? Thanks in advance.
4,song on american wedding,"does anyone kno the name or artist of the song in american wedding that has lyrics about ""freedom""??"
4,song name,Can anyone tell me the name of the song and the artist that was playing when Jim and Michelle were walking down the beach and through the wedding room sad after Stifler killed their flowers?
3,Into the Mystic-Van Morrison,"Hey Mike, the wallflowers covered that song from Van Morrison. (which is actually much better)"
4,Nora Jones song?,"I thought there was a song in the movie by Nora Jones. I dont remember where it was played, but I remember hearing it. Or at least I thought that was who it was....?????"
1,Why???,"Whoever decided to leave the Nora Jones song off of the sound track should be fired. I would have bought the CD just for that song. But since it is polluted with all that other noise, there is no way I will purchase it."
3,Song Name...,anyone figure out the name of that Norah Jones song yet?? please post it if you have....
4,Bachlor Party song,"The song when the girls first come into the bachlor party IS ""Summertime Girls"" by the Baha Men!! It's listed in the credits at the end of the movie. As far as I can find it's not on any album as of yet and I have yet to find it on any download sites. But I assure you this is the name of the song and The Baha Men ARE the ones who sing it."
4,whats that SONG?,"whats the very last song in the movie ,right when the credits begin to come up? its a good song, please someone let me know the answer, thank ya."
1,Horrible. Must be a FAKE,"I have purchased cold steel products before and swear by them. However this product that I purchased BROKE at the hilt. Handle broke right off. I was doing the same phone book cut they do in the video to show off my new 200$ sword. Boy what a fool I looked. This MUST be a FAKE COLDSEEL ITEM. If you want this sword BUY IT FROM COLDSTEEL'S OFFICIAL WEBSITE. No other coldsteel product i have owned had anything near this much of a quality flaw. Not to mention the inside of the handle was filled with ELMER'S GLUE. I own a 500$ rapier by ColdSteel and you can bend the blade like a fishing pole and it does not break. This purchase was a huge disappointment for me. I will never order another coldsteel product unless it is from their website. that way i know it's a real coldsteel product.Coldsteel makes the best knives and swords, but BUYER BEWAREBUY IT FROM THE WEBSITE."
2,Cold Steel Grosse Messer,After viewing the video of this sword on cold steel's site I had to get it. When it arrived I was disappointed. The sword did not come razor sharp like cold steel claims. The handle is made of soft wood and came with a hairline crack in it. You can get a sword of this quality or better for $100 cheaper on just about any sword site on the internet. I purchased a United Black Katana for $60 that is a far better sword than this. Buyer beware this sword is not all it hyped up to be by Cold Steel.
4,The Religions of Ancient Egypt and Babylonia,I am still reading this book but so far I have found it very informative. I am looking forward to reading more!
2,Not what I was expecting,"This may be an effective, helpful book; however, I could not make it through the first chapter as a result of the countless references made towards Christian values and God. Let me say that I have absolutely nothing against a person who wishes to preach the word of God. On the contrary, I am encouraged by those who believe this is their calling. Unfortunately, I did not purchase this book to be inspired; I purchased this book to understand the author's perception of valuable communication skills. If this book were titled, ""Communication Plus: How to be a Good Christian Speaker so People Will Listen"" I would better understand the author's perspective."
1,Hopeless and horrible on a PDA,"It's possible to stumble around on this software when it's installed on a desktop/laptop, but just try to export maps to a PDA. The interface is clumsy, confusing and completely unintuitive. As a streets/trips map for use with a PDA and a GPS, it is a terrible choice and you will struggle with it forever. The interface on this software is about the worst I've seen on a PC in 15 or so years."
2,Price is the only draw to this package,"If price is the key to your buying decision, then this is the package for you. If ease of use and reliability are more your bag, keep looking. This review is based on the PALM version of the software.Desktop: graphics are not nearly as nice as Microsoft's Strets & Trips, and it doesn't appear to allow you to export multiple routes in one shot to the hand-held. To bad MS doesn't make a Palm client.Routing: frequently tried to take me off road between curvy sections of an interstate.Bluetooth GPS: This is my biggest complaint. It FREQUENTLY loses connnection to my bluetooth GPS receiver. I've run other software on the same Palm T|X without ever losing connectivity. DeLorme represents reinstalling the package. Sure. At least that will get me to hang up the phone.Tracking: gives notice that you have a turn coming up in ""less than one half mile."" Ok...what about when ALL your turns are in a short distance? Should be configurable to give additional notices."
2,Maybe OK if you download a specific route to the PDA,"I had SA2006 Handheld set up on a Tungsten T3 with Earthmate Blue Logger bluetooth GPS receiver. It worked, but performance was so awful that I didn't use it.It's perhaps worth the money if you just want to compute a route on your PC and download it to the PDA.If any route computation is required on the PDA, I suggest you go out for coffee while you're waiting.Want to download a map of your state to the PDA's memory card? Forget it. With a 14 Megabyte map of two New Jersey counties, the PDA is already on its knees.This software might be a tolerable alternative to using MapQuest and taking some printouts in the car. That's about it.I now use TomTom5. It's not cheap, and TomTom's authorization procedures are a pain, but it really works for both advance planning and realtime navigation. The whole US database fits comfortably on a cheap SD card."
2,Sometimes,"Seemed to work great on my Axim X50V until I upgraded OS to Windows Mobile 2005. Even with repeated re-installs, I could not get the software to see the GPS. (Pocket Streets and GPS Viewer seemed to have no problem finding and displaying from the GOS). Also, sometimes zooming in/out without waiting for the screen to complete loading can result in hanging of the program."
1,Not worth it - don't bother,The software is very slow on Palm. The search take a light year to get anything done. It's not worth trying it - even if they give you money. I can not believe they are selling it for money. Stay away from it!!
1,Poor performance...,"I have had this product for a few months and have used it on my Dell Axim x50v on trips to California and Massachusetts. Selecting maps to download to your Pocket PC on your home PC is tedious and has no provision for downloading only a route without a map. Downloaded is slow for any large metropolitan map area like Boston or San Francisco. Once a map in loaded one can route on the Pocket PC but I had the Axim never complete many times after waiting over 15 minutes. I had to do a hard reset to get out of it. Cancelling the routing did not work.Also, when the routing did work I found that it often made poor route selections. For instance routing from Southborough, MA to a zoo in Southwick (only about 40 miles), it chose to use a state route parallel to I495 and jumped on and off the expressway rather than using I495 for the entire route.Not worth your money in my opinion."
2,Eeeeeeeeeeewwwwwww,"Ugh. Like a manufactured home vs. a stick-built house, Fleming's manufactured (aka ""training and technique"") blues voice compares unfavorably to other jazz/blues singers/lounge acts. Would not, COULD not, listen to this recording straight through--one big long, breathy, minor key train wreck in the making. Took the CD on a road trip and had to pull over and remove from queue--either that or drive into a wall."
1,Fleming Should Not Be Singing These Songs,"Renee Fleming is a remarkable classical singer, but this music is not for her. One need only listen to a few bars of ""In My Life"" to realize that she's trying much too hard and completely missing everything this song is about. She tries to make up for her insecurity by overemoting and overdramatizing virtually every song. It just doesn't work. One doesn't have to copy the original versions or even styles of these songs, but you do have to have some sense of their rhythm, meaning, etc. Dawn Upshaw is someone who gets it. Unfortunately Renee doesn't, and it's really quite painful to hear."
2,"Lovely, But Empty","I am not upset with Fleming's choice of material - she is ever tasteful - but I am upset with the fact that she approaches this material as she does everything else she sings. It is too thought-out rather than felt. She provides a glimmering, glamorous surface to each song, many of them sung at funereal tempos, but invests these songs with no depth, only a self-conscious, self-regarding - if lovely - pseudo-serious generic polish to each number. She is a singer who is all affect, to little effect. Everything here is beautiful, but she reveals not one moment of emotional honesty or artistic risktaking in this entire high-toned enterprise."
3,Interesting Excursion,"Fleming's voice is one of our generation's great instruments. But the interpretive expression and magesterial technique she brings to Handel, Mozart and Strauss aren't what's needed in Mon Cherie Amour. Bruce Springsteen caught the qualities that one looks for in a jazz singer in his description of Sinatra's voice, filled with ""bad attitude, life, beauty, excitement, a nasty sense of freedom, sex and a sad knowledge of the ways of the world."" Fleming's is, by contrast (as one of her CDs is titled) ""the beautiful voice."" And so, unsurprisingly, the singing here is beautiful indeed. What's lacking -- partly owing to song selection, partly to performance -- is the immediate sense of heartbreak, of vulnerability, that comes through in jazz vocalists like Diane Reeves, Sarah Vaughn, Elaine Elias et al. All of us Fleming fans can take heart in the fact that when she decided on opera, the world was not deprived of the next Billie Holliday"
1,disappointed,I was disappointed in this CD. Maybe it is the selection Renee chose to sing.I love her voice but prefer to hear it in operas.
1,bizarre vocals,"Why is she trying to sound like a third rate Sarah Vaughan? Fleming's performances are scratchy sounding, tired and dead. This album is an embarrassment. It's only too obvious that she has no feel for the material and is faking it. Perhaps this is some contagion she caught while working with the increasingly sloppy singing of the boob-baritone Bryn Terfel on their live duet album. For a start, sing in your own voice Renee (p.s. you're not black), and just get the feeling right. If you think you're slumming, your listeners will also hear you slumming. I guess next we'll have Ramon Vargas boo-boo-boo-booing like Bing Crosby. Save me Jesus!"
4,Haunted Heart,An unusal CD for Ms. Fleming and I purchased on advise from friend. Knew nothing about Ms. Fleming with the exception of being an opera singer and I was very pleasantly surprised at how well she can sing the standards. I can recommend this CD.
1,This is absolutely horrendous,"I can't say I know much about opera. I purchases ""Dark Hope"" based on a NPR interview and thought it was interesting. So, I thought I'd give this puppy a try. I am a big fan of several of the composers of the pieces on this disk. (Jimmy Webb's ""The Moon is a harsh mistress"", Joni Mitchell's ""River"", Lennon and McCartney's ""In My Life"".) Renee does not know how to sing these with any sense of intimacy or they type of feel that this material calls for. She just tries way to hard to sound emotional and sincere and just ends up sounding silly.Bill Frisell does okay on the album, but if you want to hear him play, you should just get on of his disk."
2,One of my favorite preformers,"Does anyone not love this young lady? I just don't think this disc does her or her big voice justice. I am not a musician, but this recording sounds too low and too slow. I will buy anything she records and I do travel 100 miles to see her,but I hope her next effot in this venue shows off her voice and personalty more favorably."
1,Fatty Vegetables on the Side,"This cookbook includes recipes for a wide array of vegetables as well as interesting background on the origin and distribution of each vegetable in human societies. Unfortunately the recipes tend to be high in fat. Most of the recipes include generous portions of butter, oil, or heavy cream. Nutritional information is not included for the recipes. People should eat more vegetables, but with the obesity epidemic, these recipes are not the best way to improve our diets."
4,DOES WHAT IT'S MEANT TO DO,"I was looking for a fanny pack that was roomy and sturdy and both are true of this denim fanny pack. It holds a lot of stuff, has a compartment for important papers and a Passport and keeps it close to your body. There are 3 other compartments although the largest one is a bit deceiving as the bottom is very narrow, limiting the amount of space you really have. I was on a two week cruise and used just this for all my needs and it worked perfectly."
5,Great Party Snack or school snack,These small bags of Pirate Booty are great! The kids at my sons birthday party went crazy with having their own individual size package of Pirate Booty! It is a taste treat and a heck of a lot better than sugary candy! Plus it is great to great enough to add as school snacks for backpacks!
5,Booty,"1 toddler, 1 teen and 1 inbetween, plus 1 nana and two other adults all like the Pirates Booty as well as the Smart Puffs and Tings. We each have different favorites and we do slow down in eating them by the end of the case, but we like em all and are happy with the price. Besides being a bit healthier, we actually like them better than most of what we find in the local grocery stores. Packaging was good and shipping was fast."
5,"Men Masculinity and the Media, by Steve Craig",I am currently writing Thesis on Masculinity and Consumption in Australia 1992-2006. This book editted by Craig was a great resource. I especially enjoyed When Men put on Appearances by Diane Barthel and Beer Commercials by Lance Strate.
1,WTP?!?,"What's The Point? It's a cookbook where half the recipes are from well-reknowned chefs exposing their true form, and the other half are Bittman's adulterated versions that are nothing like the original. In some he doesn't have the same method or technique; in others he doesn't even use the same base ingredient. It's like comparing apples to motor oil. Complex to Simple? Of course it's simple if you remove 90 percent of what was in the original! You cannot compare a grilled version of a protein dish to a sauteed version of another no matter how much you try to spin it.And the photos are the worst I've ever seen for a major release of a cookbook. They are still photos taken from the video shoot while they were in the kitchens. Some of the photos have big block squares; the tell-tale sign of how the digital rendering couldn't be made. Take any .jpg file and blow it up 1,000 percent and you'll see exactly the results printed in this book.Very disappointed."
5,So Nice I Read It Twice!,"This book was entertaining on so many levels. Funny, sad, enticing, fun! It did not disappoint by far! Nala leaves her drab life behind when her tall, dark and handsome Prince Charming (Zaire) comes along. She went from an underappreciated hard working corporate femme (like most of us), to a confident, seductive vixen overnight! Were the changes and occurences in her newly exciting and expensive life overbearing, though? You're darn right they were. Her Prince Charming turns into someone less than trustworthy and sometimes abusive. Does she stay or does she go? Does the life he's able to offer her outweigh the fear of going back to living check-to-check in her one bedroom apartment? I won't blow it for you but lets's just say the ride this girl takes is bumpy and this story gives new meaning to the saying 'be careful what you wish for because you just might get it'!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Not for hearing Aids,"This phone is not Hearing Aid Compatible. Yoo bad I had to find that out after I bought it, because Amazon stuck me for the return shipping! No reason to buy from Amazon again - I will always shop Crutchfield.The speakerphone is cool, but the sound is like you are in a tunnel, or there is a rag over the mouthpiece - muffled. It's too big as well. Clumsy-ish.I'll end up sticking with Panasonic, the tinny sounding phone, unless I can find a Sony somewhere."
3,"Looked great, but did not perform","features looked great, form factor was great...However, my old 2.4 Ghz phone sounded better. This Motorola unfortunately kept cutting in and out (quite frequently)."
1,LIVE AND LEARN,"I BOUGHT A 5.8, SO I WOULDN'T HAVE PROBLEMS WITH MY 2.4 GHZ ROUTER. I DON'T. I CAN'T GO MORE THAN 50 FT AWAY FROM BASE, OR I LOOSE SIGNAL. I HAVE MOVED THE BASE AROUND MY HOME TO AVOID ANY POSSIBLE INTERFERANCE. DIDN'T WORK. IF I DIDN'T THROW AWAY THE BOX, I WOULD HAVE RETURNED IT. DON'T WASTE MONEY. I HAVE TO REPLACE IT. I HAD A V-TECH 2.4 THAT WOULD WORK A BLOCK AWAY. MY WIFE KEPT LOOSING THE HADSETS BY LEAVING THEM ON THE BUMBPER OF THE CAR, SO I NEEDED A NEW PHONE. I WENT THIS ROUTE. EXPENSIVE MISTAKESIGNEDLIVE AND LEARN"
1,Unreliable and Pricy,This is my second Motorola phone and I have had major issues with both. The phones both had issues with several things not working and I found that Motorola service is not the best.If you think this 5.8 Ghz phone will give you better range DON'T BUY IT. I have had other 2.4 Ghz phones that reach to the end of my yard. This one doesn't even make it to the back door... take my advise go with a cheaper more reliable phone.
3,No answering machine and Memory to save number,This phone lacks two features that I am looking for. One is the answering machine and the other is to store numbers so that a call can be dialed with single touch. Lack of the talking beyond 50ft is a big drawback?
3,Not satisfied with the Hand set,"Sounds to me that there is a issue with the Handset it never shows that it is fully charged, it always shows for ever it is charging. other than that the base sounds good to me. Is there any chance I can get a replacement of this phone with a good one."
4,SO FAR SO GOOD,"I have no complaints about this phone...not yet anyway. I only gave this phone a 4 because let's face it, no product is perfect!The best feature on this phone is the speaker option. the worse feature is that its too slim to hold shoulder to ear,( which can be cancelled out by the before mention speaker on the handset) and not to mention the large clip on the back of the phone so that you can hang it on your shirt or blouse while you change a poopy diaper or braid your daughters hair...Fabulous!I be back to update you if there are any problems with this Motorola MD671 5.8GHz Cordless Speakerphone/Caller IDBE GOOD TO ONE ANOTHER.LOVE YOURSELFTAKE GOOD CARE OF YOURSELF.TOMORROW ISN'T PROMISED TO US.BUT, THE RESURRECTION IS!JUST ASK MY SKYLAR GRACE- ;(Peace and Love to AllSMOOCHES"
4,"Quality phone, short on ergonomics","This phone, and the expansion kit are high-quality. I'm not one for whiz-bang bells & whistles. It performs clearly and flawlessly as a cordless phone. I think that is the most important part and is where this phone shines. You're paying for that quality, and it's worth it.The only strike against it is ergonomics. Small buttons on the base make it difficult to dial from the base. The buttons on the phone are sized appropriately for the size of the phone, and are larger than the ones on the base.The phone is flat and relatively narrow. It's easy to hold, especially with the ribbed-rubber sides. However, it does not do well if you try to ""sandwich"" it between your head/ear and shoulder. It supports a mic/speaker headset (on the portable) with the same type you use for your cell phone.The speaker phone is adequate on the phone and base, but I rarely use it."
2,returned it,"It certainly looks cool, but (1) the audio quality was only so-so, (2) it interfered dramatically with my analog 5.8ghz GE phone, and (3) I learned that, like most 5.8ghz phones, it probably also used 2.4ghz, a potential issue for my wireless networking setup."
3,Could not set the correct time on handset,"Every function work so far except the time on the handset. I live in PA (Eastern time). Whenever I set the correct time, the handset always automatically changed to the time three hours late, I don't know why. That's the only problem I found so far."
3,"Like it, but prepare to be blasted on low battery.","I like this phone. However, whatever the volume you've set it to, when you're talking and the battery goes low, it BLASTS your ear with a loud warning tone...so much so that you hesitate to return it to your ear after you get back down off of the ceiling.Obvious features that are missing...if you expand with more phones, they don't synchronize your phone book settings. Each one says you have ""xyz new calls"" independently. The battery charge does not last long (4 days maybe). You have to program the numbers you want into each thing, the base, and each phone.Love the speakerphone option on the handsets and base.But, beware of the loud warning tone (should have a recall for that). It could cause damage (it seems like it anyway)."
4,Good - but I needed one more feature,"I bought this without paying attention to fact that this doesn't have an answering machine. Why would Motorola make a high end product w/o answering system? Granted, it was my fault that I didn't pay attention.Rest of the funtions etc are very good. The speaker phone is excellent. I just wanted other buyers to be aware of this."
2,Reliability not great and where's the service?,"I purchased the base unit plus an extra handset. The functions are nice, but I've had some problems that bug me. When the phone is in use, a blue light flashes on the base unit. There have been several times when the phone indicates that it is in use, even though no one is using it. I check the handsets and other phones in the house and all are properly 'hung up'. After pushing the on/off button a couple of times on the Motorola handsets, the phone 'hangs up'. This is a pretty big problem because the line is busy during this time, which means missed calls.The second problem is with the speakerphone on the handset. Great feature, but sometimes it fades in and out, I notice this happens when the handset moves,like when you go to put it down or walk with it.So I sent two emails to Motorola's customer care about this and have received absolutely no response."
4,"So far, so good...","This phone has some pretty good features but the battery life is so-so (2 days of battery life on a full charge with a good amount of usage) probably due to the Ni MH battery versus a nice high capacity Li-on battery. All in all, good features, voice quality is clear but battery life is a bit bleh."
5,Cordless Phone Very High Quality Sound,I am very pleased with the Motorola MD671 Cordless Speakerphone. The quality of sound is extremely good. It has many features that make it user friendly. You will be very pleased with this purchase.
1,...just back from the post office.,"I've just mailed back this model after 4 days, and am asking for a refund. The reception that I had on any of my calls was oh so poor. No matter what was tried I had a poor reception/lots of static."
2,"Fine, but transmits on 2.4 GHz also (interferes w/ wireless)","The phone works fine.But it transmits on 2.4 GHz frequency for incoming calls (which is not disclosed on the materials included w/ the phone), and which can interfere w/ wireless networks. As a 50+% 2.4 GHz phone, it isn't a great deal, either.I think Motorola should really provide better documentation for this, so buyers can make informed decisons (other than returning the product)."
1,"Initially nice, but degrades over time","I bought this phone because it was one of the few that met all of my requirements. I have a base and 5 handsets and was initially very happy with its performance. But, after 6 months, one handset became noisy so I put it in the basement where its rarely used. After about a year, another phone was becoming noisy. Now after 14 months, I have 3 phones that are unusable because of noise (the basement one got worse). This is two months after the warranty period and Motorola has no interest in replacing phones just out of warranty. I had previously respected Motorola as a good name in communications. I no longer do.My advice is if you choose to get this phone, send it in for warranty repair at the first hint of noisy connections."
2,most pathetic customer support,"If you buy this phone with rebate then don't expect the rebate check to come back. They will give customer support number which is disconnected. After getting the other contact number (for that you have to spend lot of time), that phone line will stay busy for minimum of 40 mins. After 40 mins u will be connected but in a queue. Add another 30-40 mins to talk to customer support."
2,Doesn't charge well.,"Works fine otherwise, but charging is pretty important.We wouldn't buy another one."
2,Disappointed - poor hand and speaker phone quality,"I bought the phone based on the positive reviews and found that at least with the one I bought, the handset and speaker phone is very poor. I get complaints from callers on the other end of echos and difficulty hearing. My concerns resonate with those who were also disappointed with the phone.I also own the Uniden and think it's far superior in all aspects. I would pass on this phone."
2,"Looks good, but didn't work for me.","I really liked the look of this phone. It had everything I needed. I liked the speaker phone, the ease of use. However, I never got a clear signal to the handset. It would always sound like a bad cell phone call, even to the person on the other end. I was right next to the base as well. I had a Uniden 5.8 GH phone in the exact same location that worked fine. That phone didn't have a speaker on it so I ordered a new one. I ended up sending the Motorola back because I never got a clear signal to the handset. The Uniden model works so much better and I can live without the speaker phone."
3,Motorola MD671 cordless phone,"Needing a new home phone, I went to the web in search of a cordless phone that included the capacity to add more handsets as needed,had no answering machine and was reasonably priced. The latter two narrows the choices considerably. After much research and reading of reviews I chose the Motorola MD671 and it's accompanying handset, the MD61. They were easy to set up, look good and I was happy with my choice. What is disappointing about the phone is the battery life...very short. It does not give a warning beep, it just shuts off. I notice that even keeping it off the base uses battery life. The volume, as I have been told, is also an issue. Friends and colleagues comment that they can't hear me very well; at times I have a hard time hearing the party on the other end. The cordless phone will never replace a land line, but I do like the convenience of being mobile while on the phone."
3,Not good product as sound quality is not good,Looks pretty good but sound quality is not good. Not good product
2,It is OK !!,"Hi,The prodcut is not very good. My handset was having problems when I received. I also have to speak louder so that person at the other end can hear properly. Might it is a phone malfunction. Battery life is Ok !!! Speaker on the headset is one of the good featuere."
5,Very Nice System,"Phone works great. Speakerphone is nice an clear, and menu's are all easy to find. No complaints at all."
4,Review of cordless speaker phone,"Very good unit, with good voice quality and sound. Handset has good range, throught the house.Buttons could be a little bit larger and volume could be a little bit louder also.Would recommend to purchase for home office when using a central voicemail system, not in the unit."
4,"Great, Durable Phone","After using this phone for just a few weeks, I really like this phone. The speaker-phone on the handset is awesome. I think the speaker-phone on the base could use some improvement, but overall this phone has been worth every dollar. I've dropped that handset 50 times and it still works like its brand new. It's SOLID."
3,Great Speakerphone in Base - Not True 5.8 Gig,I have had my phone for four months. The base speakerphone is really good. I ask people that I am talking with how is the sound and they say they can't tell I'm on a speakerphone. I don't know why Motorola calls this a 5.8 Gig when the handset is 2.4 Gig (Motorola doesn't tell you this). The range is very bad. One reason for buying this phone was to get the extended range of 5.8 Gig. I don't need another 2.4 Gig. The battery life is going down hill fast after four months. I get about four days on standby and a lot less when I use the phone for more than a couple of minutes. IF you want a good speakerphone with limited range then this is for you. Can't beat the price. Otherwise look for something else.
2,Broken after 11 months,Was a good phone but must have a flaw. Reciever failed and not cost effective to find/buy another. Maybe pass on this.
4,Best 5.8 GHZ for the money!,"This is a fantastic phone with lots of features and is quite a bargain after rebate! The hands-free speaker phone on the base is crystal clear - according to callers. It has a voice mail light, another unexpected but excellent feature. No more checking my voice mail every half hour, when there's a message, there's a flashing blue light on the handset and a solid red light on the base. I wanted a cordless with lots of features, without an answering machine - not easy to find! I went to all my local electronics stores and searched on-line and couldn't find another phone with this many features at this low a price.Highly recommended!"
4,It's a good buy,"The phone is great, I didn't have the blue light flashing on the handset which others were complaining about. The feature that I like the most is caller id for call waiting, I find that really useful, the ringer volume seems to be a little low to hear but other wise the phone is great, hey what more can you get for 40 bucks? I'm yet to receive the discount though.Shantanu"
4,Good phone,This is a good phone. Works all over the house and a few houses down. As of this review (12/07) the phone is starting to show signs of wear. Buttons creak and buttons fading. Not sure when I purchased this or why it took so long to write review.
4,A true treasure,I have an original print of this book in hardcover that my mother bought from a school library when the school closed. She read it as a teen and loved it and I too loved reading it as a teen and now as an adult. It is a treasure in my book collection.
1,Greatly Disappointed,"I have yet to listen to the Britten Sonata on this disc, however Yo-Yo Ma's interpretation of the Strauss Sonata is disgraceful. I also own the Sophie Rolland recording, and it is hundreds of times better. I purchased this disc, as I needed a recording, and as I had the other one in storage out of state, I thoguht, why not get a different artist? Well, this one was a mistake....Don't waste your money..."
2,"didn't fit, not the right spring for the unit","stars are only for quick delivery & prompt order filling. Although i carefully determined the right Echo trimmer unit model number and ordered it, it arrived promptly. But doesn't fit. It's not worth returning...still don't have suitable replacement spring. The spring should be 1/4"" less in diameter and a little longer."
5,"Easy to read, informative answer to evolution","The evolutionists reviewing this book are generally easy to spot. As a former evolutionist, I can tell you--the book is not as full of bull as most evolutionists will insist. A realization that the fossil record cannot account for creation invokes fear and hatred from those who hold that theory dear. This book does a fine job bringing that theory into question with consistent focus on the lack of evidence in the fossil record. As Gish aptly states, the fossils don't support the theory."
5,Absolutely Fantastic Book!,"Terrific book! There are few critiques of evolution available, which can surpass this fantastic book! This book has caused tidal waves among evolutionists, it has ""rocked their religion,"" so to speak. Absolutely fantastic book."
1,Balderdash,"If you really think the invisible man in the sky invented the world 6000 years ago or so, this will reinforce your dogmatic world view. If you want the science look elsewhere."
1,Absurd waste of time and paper!,"Once again, a misinformed biased individual has slopped together a horrible piece of dogma. Totally without any factual basis, this book deserves no other comment other than I am worse off for having read it. Thank God I kept my wits while doing so!"
1,not very honest,"I bought this book hoping to find arguments against evolution and a strong case for creationism. Instead, I found half-truths and misquotes. Being a christian, I am sorry that books like these make us look sily in the scientific community. Surely there must be something better out there.I am still searching for a solid creationist book, because this one did not cut it. It is a very poor scientific (if you can call it that) book."
5,One of the best critiques of evolution available.,"Indeed, the information which Gish provides in his book is enough to defeat the entire evolutionary theory. For those who are interested in finding the truth about evolution, I highly recommend this book."
1,evolution the fossils say yep,"I see that creationist and thier ilk are still spouting thier misinformation on scientific thought. Let me see if I understand the arguements here, since I can't live in the past or visit the past I can't infer from the evidence what the past was like. It's true I can't directly observe the origins of life, but I can't directly observe the origins of rome either so therefore archeology isn't a science. That pretty stupid, Causes have effects evidence exists because there where events that cause it to spring into being. Creationist are simple unable to give up thier a priori belief system no matter what and have to write long rationalizations of there world view, or thought construtions. If you wish to find out more go to talk origins on usenet and find out how wrong your ideas are."
1,The Fossils Still SAY YES!!!!,"The reason for the title of my review is that creationists tend to forget just how difficult,in nature, it is to create a fossil. The just don't appear every time an animal dies. We are lucky to have fossils at all. So lets just say that there is a god that created everything in one blow. Why do we even have fossils, because god wanted us to be entertained...BLAH!!! Look at the facts, evolution did occur and it is still occurring."
2,Frustrating,This is one of those books where if you believe the main thesis you will come away nodding your head in approval at the well thought out cogent arguments put forward. On the other hand someone with the slightest misgivings about the content will more than likely throw the book away in disgust before getting half way.Falling into the latter camp I just wish that a Creationist could put forward his or her argument without once mentioning Evolution. I do not need to reinforce my belief in Evolution by attacking the bible.
1,The book of lies~!,"Shame on Gish. He once again throws together a manipulative pack of lies and distortions (and he knows it), with no factual evidence supporting his obsured ideas. I just can't see how this disgusting man still holds any bit of sway with anybody, but then again I've never undergone the misfortune of being brainwashed by a fundie church. Shame on you Gish, SHAME ON YOU~!"
2,Great artist... MOST of the time,"The story on Rampal was that he hated practicing. Most of the time he played beautifully, but for this recording it doesn't sound like he put in 15 minutes making sure the notes were securely in place. His trademark elegance & brio are undermined by technical sloppiness. Imagine a great actor who learned a famous role long ago and has agreed to perform it again, but doesn't bother going over it to make sure it's going to be good.Instead, go for Rampal's other Mozart recording (with Paillard, on Erato) or Emmanuel Pahud (with Abbado / Berlin Phil., on EMI)."
1,SUPER GROUP? SUPER DULL!,"Supergroups are a strange entity. On the whole the expectation far outweighs their worth (anyone remember that disaster KGB?) Zebra comprises members from If and Osibisa. Heavy rock watchers should also notice ex-Gillan bassists John McCoy's involvement. I've always loved Terry Smith's guitar playing, fluid and exceptionally fast he should be spoken of in the same awe as say-Allan Holdsworth (proof? 'sector 47' on If 4) on this his guitar playing is fine paticularly on 'hungry horse' but te whole album is let down by below par songwriting. It just isn't very good. The Osibisa influence outweighs the If's and it shows 'Mr J' is plain tedious and Dave Quincey's tenor is used more as a background influence which is a shame, his solo's with If were always a high point. I brought this on vinyl when it came out and wasn't impressed and now thinking maybe i made a mistake i've brought this reissue. It still is a mistake. Shame."
4,not bad,"Shampoo works as it is written on it, dreadlocks look great.Only thing is awful (for me) is the smell of this shampoo (mint and something else, i don't know how to explain it)"
3,nice but the shipping is too high,i bought a bottle of this a couple months ago. it has an unusual slight numbing effect from the menthol. and its great at getting your hair very clean. much better than store shampoo. if only the shipping cost was a bit lower.
1,This camera is junk...,"I bought this camera because it was cheaper and thought that a company such as Polaroid would put out a decent camera. Nope. As everyone has stated the picture quality is HORRIBLE. Unless you have the perfect light then don't bother taking the picture. The flash (like stated) washes out faces or it's dark. The time between flash and actual picture is crazy. I have bought brand new batteries only for it to shut off 30 seconds later. The settings reset with every picture. It's a horrible, horrible camera. I have lost many photos with this camera and would do better with a disposable. Do not waste your money."
4,My camera,I like this camera. I love the microphone on it. It comes in handy. The only thing is when you take a picture sometimes the flash is to bright and the picture comes out white. But overall this camera is great.
2,"Great price, not such a good deal though.","I purchased the PDC 5080 because I was looking for an affordable 5 megapixel camera. When I received the camera within 2 hours I discovered the microphone for the video feature did not work, the flash whited out everything unless I took a picture in pitch black conditions and the camera completely froze (i.e. could not take/view pictures, turn on or off, nor see anything in the lcd screen) twice. I contacted Polaroid and Computer Geeks (the company from which the camera came) by e-mail 4 days ago and neither contacted me. I had to call Computer Geeks and set up a return which went smoothly. So all in all, great price but far from a good deal."
5,I love it,I have no problems with this product and am extremely satisfied with it and the company that I bought it from.
2,Poor choice,"I purchased this camera 'on sale' as I didn't have previous experience with a digital and didn't want to spend a lot of money. Wish I had spent the extra money as I will now be doing so anyway. The picture quality is not very good. Even using a flash indoors when the lighting is not 'perfect' the quality of the photos is bad. The best pictures you can take with this camera are outdoors in the daylight, and don't think of using at night -- even with the flash, pictures don't show. When using a flash indoors, don't get very close -- they come out way too bright; however, without you can't even see one's face! Just don't buy a Polaroid, look for another make."
2,"Misleading description - basically just cheap brown tint, and way too dark","I bought this because there was something in the description about ""stencils"" or something like that. This kit is really junky. Besides the tint itself, it came with some really cheap half hearted wax strips on plastic that I don't see how one could use for accurate waxing - just a long rectangular strip. No ones eyebrows are straight like that.The tint itself is more like almost black. I don't know what their ""light brown"" is like. I found that as a natural blond, in a pinch, if I leave it on for 10 SECONDS it will not look weird. Anything over that, and I look like Groucho Marx for a week.If you can get your hands on some Intensive Lash/Brow tint, go for that."
3,ok product,"Ok product, easy to apply, just wish it would last longer. I was excited to have eyebrows when I first applied the tint but they quickly faded after a few showers. :("
1,Doesn't work,"I am dying my eyebrows for over 10 years now. I followed the instructions and did it for 2-3 min on each eyebrow, for 4 (!) times each. It slightly tinted my (blonde) eyebrows."
4,Pretty Good Product,"This product does exactly what it says. It is important to follow the instructions exactly! I did one brow at a time and 2 seperate applications to each brow, just to make sure it did not get too dark. I have blond hair, but I do not like blond eyebrows, so this tint was perfect!"
2,Godefroy Brow Shape and Tint Kit,"I was ecstatic when I tried this product. My brows were the perfect color even when I wasn't wearing makeup. And the hair removal stickers really worked. I had to call my daughter right away 24 hours later to tell her how great they looked. But I told I couldn't find anywhere on the box as to how long the color should last. She looked it up online and thought it was at least month, six weeks? Well, to my dismay the color lasted 11 days. I was very disappointed and won't be purchasing this product again."
4,"Good Color, but does not last.","I have sparse and light brows. I normally wear tinted brow gel and or brow pencil. I thought this product would be great for times when I don't want to bother with makeup, like vacations.Application was simple enough, the color is very good, my only con with this product is the fact that the color does not last very long (couple of weeks tops). This is a great alternative to getting your brows tinted in a salon."
1,It stains your skin and,"it's very hard got it off. I used soap, facial cleanser. Eventually it did come off, but the skin was red and broken."
4,Great At-Home Eyebrow Tinting Kit,"I really like this kit for eyebrow tinting. It's very easy to use. As directed, I only do one eyebrow at a time. I leave the product on each brow for 2 minutes. I noticed after about 4 weeks, I'm ready to tint my brows again. I have not used the shaping portion of this kit. I have my brows professionally waxed every 8 weeks so I can't comment on how well that part of the kit works. The price for this kit is very reasonable. With this kit, you can tint your eyebrows three times. It's certainly cheaper than having my eyebrows tinted in the salon three times."
3,Tried Very Hard to Like it,"I really wanted this DVD and tried really hard to like it. I used it several times and though it has all the right elements for me - upbeat, dance like, instructor is likeable, fast moving- I still have not really enjoyed as much as the other Crunch videos."
4,"Workout, yes; Go-Go, no","For anyone looking for actual go-go moves, this doesn't really deliver. I think ""go-go"" in the title is mainly for marketing. As someone who really does like to go-go dance, I was disappointed this didn't offer more legit moves. Perhaps it would have felt more go-go if the music would have gone along with that vibe, instead of goofy electronic keyboard (that you hear in the video clip above) or the Latin-esque music.That said, this IS a good workout, and fun, and the moves are broken down to easy steps. But the few go-go moves involved do not constitute a go-go workout. Look up the Pontani Sisters for that! Four stars for the great workout, though."
2,Not so much,"I agree with the 3 stars, and I'll even go lower. I LOVE most of the Crunch workouts - I have a bunch. This one, though, was really disappointing. Like another reviewer, I didn't think there was anything ""go-go"" about it - the music was something you hear at a retirement home, the women in the workout were absolutely ridiculous, and the dances were far from challenging - even the warm up didn't warm me up. If you really want a workout stick to the Boot Camps, the Total Resculpt and the Cardio Sculpt. I also really like the ones with Ellen Barrett which I alternate with the more challenging ones - and my latest favorite is the Bikini Body one. I didn't care for the Salsa one either."
2,not the best crunch video out there.,"I get easily bored with exercise, so it's always a struggle for me to find something that I like. I also, admittedly, am a bit on the lazy side, so if there's something I find boring, I tend to stop right away. This video kept my attention for about 3/4 of the time. The routines were a bit too repetitious for me. But the real reason I had to stop was not because of the dancing itself, but because the girl in the pink pants and green top annoyed me so much. I couldn't help but watch her. It was like a bad accident where you couldn't tear your eyes away. Honestly, I think that if I wasn't so fixated on her, then I would have enjoyed the video a lot more."
3,"Well, it could have been worse.....","I got this DVD because I am trying to do some lower impact things to let an injury heal. I liked that it was lower impact but it still got my heart rate up. It was no where near as cheesy as Denise Austin's Cardio Dance and Sculpt. However, it was not very exciting. It was fun and cute but not a real workout. Maybe I will use it as a warm up for pilates or yoga or for days when I don't want to work out because this is better than nothing.I think this would be great for pre-teens and teens. I know the title makes it sound a little questionable, but it really was not at all. It was tamer than most hiphop and jazz classes I have taken.If you are looking for a fun, cutesy dance workout or something to get you moving on days when you'd rather stay in bed, this is for you. If you are looking for a real workout, keep looking."
4,Lots of fun,"I enjoyed this dvd workout. If you like dance aerobics, then you will enjoy this. The steps are easy and though you work up a sweat, it's not too intense. You still get a good calorie burn."
4,"Lightweight, durable, small","I love the weight, well constructed, but the size is impractical, the largest bowl isn't capable of holding a cooked (1 box) bowl of mac and cheese, much less cooking it. I'd go with something bigger unless you're anorexic."
4,Good for the Formula 1 Challenged,"This is actually not a bad book. If you don't know much about Formula 1, this book will inform you. Very informative yet simple and easy reading."
3,Needs Updating!,"At one level, the book is a good basic summary of F1 racing -- the cars, history, tracks, teams and drivers, tips on attending a race, and some of the strategies involved. If you're a F1 junkie like I am, its all good.More objectively though, the book is dated... with info current up to about 2003/04, which is many respects is ancient history for F1 (new different changed teams/drivers/tracks/rules now), so if I was just getting into F1 as a viewer, this book would be really confusing since so much of the info is out of date."
3,RACE TO THE TOP,I TEACH ENGLISH EACH WEEK TO TWO RACE CAR DRIVERS. ONE IS A FORMULA RACE DRIVER AND THE OTHER IS A SUPER GT RACE DRIVER. AS I AM A NOVICE AT RACING I PURCHASED THIS BOOK AND FOUND IT FILLED WITH SO MUCH INFORMATION COMPLETELY NEW TO ME. IT IS AN ENGLISH LESSON AND THE DRIVERS SMILE WHEN I QUESTION THINGS I DON'T UNDERSTAND. I AM INVITED TO THE MACAU GRAND PRIX AND WILL BE USING MY DUMMIES BOOK TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IS HAPPENING. HOWEVER AS A TEXT FOR LEARNING ENGLISH IT IS FAR TOO COMPLICATED EXCEPT FOR THE PROFESSIONAL DRIVERS WHO LIVE THEIR LIVES RACING. IT IS A CASE OF THE STUDENTS TEACHING THE TEACHER SO I NEED RACING DUMMIES FOR SURVIVAL.
1,Utter waste of time,"This piece of garbage is plastic. I guess they call it ""weighted"" because it's a heavier than normal plastic, but plastic nonetheless. It broke after ONE use.So, avoid this product at all cost and make sure what you're ordering is an ALL METAL BASE, rather than this cheap piece of plastic."
2,great everything except range,"Purchased from Best Buy and eventually returned. This phone has great features and is attractive and expandable. We picked this one on a whim at the store because it stood out as small enough to fit into a pocket, yet had every feature we wanted. We loved everything about it except for the fact that it didn't reach from one end of the house to the other. A phone that can't do that in a 1500 square foot house isn't any good to me. Even with the phone in the middle of the house it lost reception in parts. If you have a small or medium sized apartment this is probably a great choice, especially if you want multiple mailboxes. I do agree with a previous reviewer that there was static in the background which I noticed right away. It was more like low-volume white noise then static, and thus it didn't really bother me, and I would have kept it if it weren't for the limited range. A phone shouldn't have that happen either, though."
4,I've not had the reported problems,"I bought this phone without doing my research before hand based on the great features, sale price, and the look of the phone. Got home, and read the two reviews here. After about six weeks, I can not report any of the problems the first two reviews reported. If I start to have problems, I'll update this review. For my part, I am very happy with this phone."
1,WOW!! Bad reception. TWICE!,"I bought this phone because I thought the three mailboxes would be nice to have. But when the reception is so bad that no matter where you put the base or how close you are to it there is static, it is not worth it. It also has a feedback that causes your words to be echoed back to you. I bought two of these phones, each from a differnt store to make sure that I had not simply gotten a defective one and found the problem to be the same on both. Also I charged both phones for 16 hours, per the instructions, before trying them. This phone is a failure. A lot of great features, but the most important reason you buy a phone is to be able to hear what the poeple who are calling you say. Who could use a phone for more than 30 seconds with so much feedback."
2,"Bad range, noisy reception","It looses reception easily once you get to the other side of the house. Motorola tech support had us power it down, etc, but nothing improved. Basically, he said too many devices use 5.8 Ghz frequency, so there's higher possibility for interference. I doubt that though, as other phones seem to work just fine."
3,Good..has no wall mount,"Has good features for the money you pay, but you cannot mount it on the wall, which someone living in an apartment would do. All phones, come with a wall mount attachment and this one does not have one. Other than that, the phone looks good, is compact, has no antennas on handsets (which is a plus, because those are the one that normally break)."
3,it worked,"while we had a land line these were great. calls were clear. range was good. my home only had 1 phone jack, so the 2nd handset from 1 base station was handy"
2,Not Bad But Not Worth It,"My wife and I purchased this phone from Best Buy about 6 months ago and ran into some of the same troubles as the ones listed above(and below), but we have a few more interesting problems that are really annoying. First, the second handset doesnt sit correctly in the base and makes the connection to charge noise constantly! you have to set it in there just right to make it stop. Secondly, our numbers are extremely hard to enter and when it does enter, we get a few extra numbers added to the sequence. not a bad phone but i think were going to try a new set very soon! hope this review helps"
4,A must have Book for anyone who enjoys complex flavours.,"A must have book for anyone who enjoys complex flavours, which not only work together, but, are staisfying, and lighter in in fat. The PBS master of French cuisine has done it again! In this Offering Jacques and (his daughter) Claudine, put together meals which are not only satisfying, but, appealing to all the senses. This is done in a manner in which the novice can accomplish, without being condescending to the more experienced home gastronome.Colourful photos, and artwork, as well as, straight forward directions, and descriptions (of both menus and ingredients), motivate the reader into the creation of a cullinary frenzy, wether it be for family, or home entertaining.This is a ""MUST HAVE"", for anyone who enjoys good food, with a healthy twist!"
5,best deal,"Compared to Vonage and Lingo, the adapter is the same and the price plans are nearly the same. I'm in the uS, but the service has had no problems so far and makes me realize this broadband phone stuff is the same as any other phone. Except as they say, cheaper."
1,"Linksys Phone Adapter PAP2 - VoIP phone adapter - Ethernet, Fast Ethernet","I needed an unlocked liksys pap 2, this one is locked and its useless for me. When I bought it it was not clearly marked if it was unlocked or not."
4,Linksys VoIP adapter,This is a good product. It is simple and easy to use with any VoIP carrier (if you get it unlocked). I haven't had any trouble with it.
4,Great product but the price here is a RIP OFF,"I paid just about under 30.00 for this product. It's great! Just hard to find the crystal cream solution. When I run out, I'm going to ulta to find a similar type of crystal.Anyways, this is good but NOT worth paying the ridiculous 165 price tag! Seriously? That's price gouging just because these kits are no longer easy to find. I would not pay over 40...I'd use a face scrub instead. There is something disheartening to see someone raise a 30.00 product to over 165.00 >_<"
5,Skin renewal,"Great service by the seller, and, of course, this is a wonderful product for a facial skin rejuvenation. By the way, I use it on the top of my hands after doing my face, and it leaves them amazingly smooth and more receptive to hand moisturizer."
4,I'm happy with my purchase!,I received my product in a timely matter. I am happy with it so far. I'm hoping to have great results within a month.
3,Buy a sponge and the jar of scrub . . .,Love the scrub but the on/off button broke on my applicator and it ticked me off. Save some $$ and use your own elbow grease to scrub. It works!
2,Please don't buy this product!,"I purchased this product thinking it would really make scars and lines go away, well, unfortunately, it has only given me more blemishes and small clogged pores that eventually lead to more breakouts. It does make your skin softer right after the use but... i don't see any dramatic results. Its a pretty waste of my money and time to go through this though. The interesting part is, it only vibrates and the sponge doesn't turn.... i don't see how it can create a microdermabrasion. i would not recommend this product at ALL!!!"
5,Neutrogena Advanced Solutions,"This was purchased as a gift for my daughter, she is happy with it, so I am sure it is a good product. I bought it for the name and reputation."
2,Anticipation better then the real thing....,"I bought and then used the product for the first week like the instuction say. I followed them word for word and I really don't see any difference. I think it may have evened my skin tone a little but maybe it's all in my head (wishful thinking). Friends and family see no differnce. My skin certainly doesn't ""glow"" as the advertisment says it will. My skin wasn't even all that soft and smooth afterward. I think the only reason it's soft is because the directions say to put on face lotion after and I think it's the lotion that should get for my face feeling soft.So in conclusion...It's not worth the money and don't believe the hype!"
2,Doesn't work - Look Elsewhere,"I just bought this thinking that it would help exfoliate my skin but on the first try I noticed that the device does not spin, it just vibrates. If you take off the sponge top you notice there is nothing that moves or can turn to actually make the sponge exfoliate well. After my ""session"" I only felt the effect in my hand from the vibration but my face felt the same maybe a bit softer but from the cream it comes with due to when I tried washing it; it is was much more heavy ""creme"" than ""crystals"". I gave it two stars to see if it might has any effect if I continue to use it (I hope, for what it costs) but NO WAY does it compare to the real thing. I'm thinking of going with a sauna steamer which I hear comes with a microderm brush included and works pretty well."
3,"Works, but could do the same without it","The kit is easy to use and works just fine. I was disappointed that the foam head didn't spin - it just vibrates. With a good scrub, I could exfoliate just as well using my bare hands but now that I already have it, I'll use it.For the price, I might not recommend buying it. If it were $15 or $20, it might be a nice thing to have."
2,replacement crystals,"I bought this, loved it and then tried to buy the crystals without buying the whole kit. I can't find them anywhere! Makes it a very pricey little beauty tool"
2,"Useless, if iproute2 had had decent documentation.","I was very excited about the book in the beginning. One of the reasons was that iproute2 package (for advance routing with Linux) does not have decent document with it. After the bla-bla of the first chapter with some technical error here and there I realised that this was not going to be a fun reading. I enjoyed chapter 4 which is the manuals for the ""ip"" utility. BTW, Matthew, what is your point with Example 6.2--Loopback Dummy P110? I read it three times and couldn't figure out what you wanted to say. Of course that the routing will not work if you set up a wrong route! In general, if he'd cut the bla-bla throughout the text and provided ""right to the point"" and ""complete"" information, this book had earned 5 stars from me. I'm very happy that he was not the author of 'TCP/IP illustrated' series."
5,Mahler through Zander,"I have heard many performances of Mahler's Fifth Symphony by an assortment of conductors and orchestras over the years. In the hearing of those performances, I was always struck at how distant Mahler seemed to place himself from his audience (at any rate from me.) Or, as I now look back, was it the conductor's interpretation that distanced Mahler from me? In this new recording by Benjamin Zander and the Philharmonia Orchestra, I was struck at not only the verve of the performance, but by a new found richness of tempo. Indeed, I have never heard Mahler played with such clarity. Thanks to Maestro Zander's brilliant interpretation of the score (as well as an extraordinary performance on the part of orchestra,) he managed to bring Mahler from what I had experienced as being distant into a new spirit of intimacy which I, quite frankly, found to be breathtaking. I believe that we have found the key to Mahler through Zander and for this I am truly grateful."
2,Disappointed,"Very disappointed, but felt it was my own fault. I expected the lovely music from ""Death in Venice"", but all I found was one very dirgy side, and a ridiculous side which would be more suited to people studying music as a career. For me not a good choice, but so be it."
4,Good Read,"Some of these stories are excellent, some just good. Winterscape was one of the best stories I've read. I found the collection to be an excellent observation of ""East"" meets ""West."" ""Underground"" had an especially excellent exploration of this theme."
1,"Pretentious or pedestrian, I cant't really decide","Okay, this is an opinion but I didn't like this book. This was not a book for me. I read it, at every step I was caught between what I interpreted to be either dither pretentiousness or elevated lierary pedestrianism, but as I wrote, this is my opinion only. But, as far as I was conerned, worse still I liked it so little that I was virtually compelled to tell someone. To say that this is a brilliant set of observations of humanity would be like saying that a photocopier is capable of seeing into the soul of man, analyzing it, making it extremely and tediously dull, and them making double sided copies of it, in black, gray and white.Sorry to be so jaundiced but I really don't see what all the fuss is about..."
2,Thanks for all the thoughts.,"This was the second album by the reclusive Jandek, which he released three years after his first album. In one of his few interviews, he said that he had only intended to release one album, but after he got a few good reviews, he decided that he better keep on going. Since this album has come out, he has released an average of two albums a year. Anyway, Jandek's second album is even less accessable than his first album, if that's possible. It has a similar sound to the first album, with strange lyrics whispered/mumbled while accompanied by seemingly random notes plucked on an out-of-tune guitar. But somehow, it is even harder to listen to than the first album. Jandek is definitlely an acquired taste. Here is the track listing:1. Feathered Drums2. Point Judith3. I Knew You Would Leave4. Can I See Your Clock5. Wild Strawberries6. Forgive Me7. Hilltop Serenade8. You're the Best One9. Delinquent Words"
5,a great find!,What a treasure this is! The great team of Wright and Forrest took the melodies of the Brazilian composer Heitor-Villa Lobos to create Madalena. All three of them hold pre-eminent places in the history of twentieth century music and here we have their gift magically combined. And what a wonderful concert cast to record it. It's a treat from start to finish.
5,unique music....little known,"My husband, a musician, heard this on NPR or Public Radio.....and commented on its unique orchestration and its hidden identity.....wondered if he would ever hear it again. I found it here on Amazon (he is NOT a cyber shopper) and ordered it....however, I haven't yet given it to him as the gift I intended. Will do so soon. The CD looks to be in fine shape, and it arrived from seller in quick time, good packaging. What else to say?After he listens, if we remember to, we'll post his impressions in his own words. Mikki Garrels"
2,and so it took forty years?,"some scores are best left undiscovered. villa-lobos's attempt at a broadway musical is proof positive that most ""serious"" composers should stick to what they do best. overinflated, pretentious, and not worthy of having been recorded, this was one of the legendary ""lost"" unrecorded shows from the recording strike of the late 1940s. how much more worthy would have been recordings of frank loesser's ""where's charley?"" or kurt weill's ""love life"". many broadway shows of that era were recorded in truncated form, and call out for fresh recordings; ""magdalena"" was not one.of course, if youre a show queen, you will have to have it!"
5,"This is a wonderful, fantastic collection","This is a beautiful collection of songs...truly a joy to listen to! As both a fan of Broadway tunes and Janis...I applaud and admire her version of these songs. I recently (last night in fact!) saw Janis perform live in Kalamazoo, MI and immediately bought her CD as a result. I loved ""Sorry-Grateful,"" ""My Best Beau"" and ""Make Someone Happy"" especially though...her version of ""Surrey With the Fringe on Top"" was also really enjoyable...fun to see what a artist can do with a ""standard"" to make a song you thought you knew that much better! Oklahoma (the musical) will never be the same to me... Lots of feeling in this music and don't think you can go wrong!"
5,WoW-What a jazz singer!!!,"Each song is unique and sounds nothing like the others! A diverse selection of songs that are heart-felt, meaningful, jazzy and beautifully sung. ""It Never Was You"" by Kurt Weill will bring tears to your eyes, while others will give you a chuckle. The back up musicians are great. If you like female jazz singers and Broadway interpretations, then you MUST BUY this album!!!"
2,"I love Manhattan Transfer, but.....","This CD is boring. Yes, Janis is great, but this does not showcase her talent as the songs are lackluster and just plain boring. Buy Manhattan Transfer CDs instead."
2,Interpretation excellence compromised by sound quality,"The interpretation is simply outstanding, however, unfortunately strongly compromised by sound quality. Equivalence with state-of-the-art sound quality can only be achieved by activating the loudness-filter and simultaneously adjusting bass to the minimum and treble to the maximum on the amplifier."
3,BORRING,"Frankly Kissin's recording from when he was a child is more pleasing to listen to for me. Granted I believe that the F-Minor is better performed here than the E-Minor however I wouldn't tell anyone to buy this recording - the stars are great but, the recordings overall subpar - esspecially Concerto No. 1."
5,Magnificent Performance,"I recently purchased this CD through Amazon.com. For a live performance, the audio quality of this CD is superb. While I admire any musician who tries to do justice to Chopin's intricate compositions, this performance is truly magnificent. Murray Perahia's rendition of both concerti is the best I've ever heard -- here is a man who really understands Chopin. I appreciate the fact that he interprets Chopin without imposing his own personality on the music -- and that is rare quality these days. As far as the performance of the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra is concerned, no praise is necessary -- they are simply one of the best orchestras in the world, and their performance on this CD is up to their usual impeccable standards.This is a must-have recording. I highly recommend it."
4,Five stars for performance; Three stars for sound.,"I was impressed by Murray P's performance. Slow movements in both concertos are exquisite. Sound is very average. Had Sony done a better job on the sound, this CD would have been a real classic!!"
3,audience noise and constant coughing,"mr perahia is my favorite living pianist. his playing is breathtaking as always. it is unfortunate that this live recording is ruined by bad sound and even worse by constant coughing from the audience. it is very distracting especially during the slower parts of the concerto. one can only hope that mr. perahia will one day re-record this concerto with better sound and a more ""quiet"" audience."
5,Very Helpful,I can now play a game of Pokemon with my son. He is young and his explaination of the game was becoming frustrating. This helps! He loves it too.
4,Not what I expected..but still....,"Hi. I'm giving this a 4-star rating because thou it is not the quality I was expecting, I was not mislead by anyone except myself into that mistake.The fabric is pellon. It folds, not rolls like ""professional"" playmats do. I'm sre paint will start falling, and it can certainly not take a soak of any heavy staining liquid.It is a great product with anyone with a kid that wants to learn Pokemon TCG (like myself) because both sides are mirrored (very important if you are teaching a 3 year old) The printing is not of a great quality and it is offset in several places."
4,Cute,"It's a cute charm and the quality is good. The only problem was the wrapping. It came in a small, stapled, and torn paper envelope."
5,exceptional for the price,"I found that the tiara lace 400-thread/queen sheet set beautiful and extremly comfortable. It was not only beautiful to the eye but also to the touch. It washed very well, I was very happy with this item.thank you Maria"
5,great sheet set,"Fantastic buy,highly reccomended.Very soft and good quality.Gets a little wrinkled after washing but its cotton!Worth the price."
5,awesome sheets,"Simply fanstastic, love these sheets. For the under $40 price tag these were worth every penny!"
3,Pretty sheets for the price,"These sheets are beautiful. I even ordered an extra set of the pillowcases because we use two sets of pillows on our bed. I'm not so sure of the thread count, they seem a bit thinner than 400 thread count. The only real negative and the reason for 3 stars, you'll need to press the pillowcases and the border on the flat sheet because they are 100% cotton. These sheets do feel nice and smooth next to your skin. I wash them in cold water with Woolite to preserve the nice color."
5,Has a classy look and feel,"They are one of the best sheet sets. Even after a number of washes they retain the smoothness. As with most cotton, they do wrinkle but overall the sheet set is worth every penny."
5,Great Sheets!,"Like the other reviewers, I'm very happy with these comfy, beautiful sheets. I hope they go on sale at the $34.99 price again, so I can buy more in time for the holidays!"
5,A good Start,"This boxed set gives any person interested in learning about Miles Davis a good start. These 4 cd's will take you through each ""phase"" of Miles Davis recording history with Columbia. The notes on the booklet are good and simple. Both the music and reading material will be useful as a blueprint in order to learn more about this artist music... If you like this set get ready to spend a lot more as it will almost imposible to stay away from Miles music."
5,Miles Music is a Addiction,I can never say enough about Miles Davis.his Music is timeless.this Multi-Set Box showcases His Long Lasting Genius.not only the styles he did and The Musicians he played with but it's Like another Chapter upon another.it never slows down.the body of work is constantly challenging.He never slowed down.once you Listen to this Mans Music you can't stop.His Music Leaves you in a Spell.
4,Comfortable and good hearing protection.,"Comfortable to wear, and good hearing protection. Moveable joint makes them very comfortable as you move your head around. Only improvement would be the addition of replacement foam pieces. After a couple of weeks of use, both foam pieces snapped off at the base when inserting them into my cargo pants pocket."
3,You get what you pay for,"I just received theAO Safety/3M Tekk 350-1001 EAR Earflex Foam Tip Semi-Insert Hearing ProtectorsI used to use these 5 years ago and most likely purchased them at one of the big box stores. I own my own contracting business so I see alot of different types of hearing protection and I always liked these the best, no string. I recall these being a little more beefed up and better made, more heavy duty but these are not. They are made of very soft plastic and I broke off one ear plug right off the bat. Fortunately there are 2 sets of extra foam plugs that are included in the bag. I think if these are used carefully they will last for light duty for a long time but wouldn't last on a construction site very long. I will spend more money next time and see if I can locate a pair that are heavier duty."
1,This is NOT coyote fur!,"If you have not yet encountered the CNN and other exposes, please be aware that the Sean John jacket/parka was among the first to be proven to be made with DOG FUR!These items are marketed as ""faux fur"" or ""raccoon fur"" or, in this case, ""coyote fur""--an almost-concession to near-honesty after they were caught using the coats of dead dogs.Don't be deceived, either, by products called FinnRaccoon or raccoon (these are the coat of a dog of the sled dog type whose facial color pattern resembles a raccoon, hence the name).If you want to know whether your ""faux fur"" coat is actually made from a dead dog, please refer to CNN's and several other websites participating in this expose. But this coat, the Sean John, has already been shown by responsible investigators to be dog fur."
3,Not the best...,"The main thing I didn't like was the sentences. Mostly every sentence was 'Leo said', 'Leo did', basicaly, it was choppy at best.Second, I hated the 'daydream' part. It was... well, kind of stupid.Third, the worst part of this book was the part where everyone broke or dislocated someone, that was stupider than the daydream sequences.Last but not least, this actually had some interesting things in it. I liked the autobiography of his dad, and the Rosaria mystery actually made me want to find out what happened.Overall, it's okay, but not the best."
3,Not Gripping Enough,"I like Sharon Creech as a writer, and I particularly like Walk Two Moons and Love That Dog. So I expected to like this story and wanted to like it, but I found myself not that interested in Leo, who finds his father's journal in the attic, written when his father was a teen. The journal reveals his father's dreams and Leo comes to appreciate his father in a deeper way. The journal also reveals that his father had a sister -- a sister who Leo has never heard of. Part of the plot in Replay involves Leo finding out what happened to that sister, his aunt. Part involves putting on a school play titled Rumpopo's Porch. The message in this story is important: that families and people need to talk about things, need to share the past with the present, not hide the past from the present, and that in order to heal, people must talk, telling what's in their minds and hearts. While the message is important, the story just never came to life for me."
2,Replay,"The only cool thing about this book is the way its set up. It has the cast at the begining with all the characters, and it says ""The Curtain Opens..."" at the begining of the book, ad ""The Curtain Closes..."" at the end. Its about a boy named Leo who reads his father's autobiography his Dad wrote when his Dad was thirteen. When he finds out his dad had a sister he never heard about, he tries to figure out what happened. He's in a play, and the whole script of the play is at the end of the book. He feels invisable with all his brothers and sisters, and he imagines a lot, which gets him the name ""Fog Boy."" I really don't understand what people see in this book. There is a lack of feeling from Leo. He doesn't really say much in the book, and he doesn't replay things in his mind like he's supposed to. Instead, he imagiens what he wished would've happened. I was very disapointed with this. I expected a great book. All in all, this was a 2 and a half star book."
3,3rd/4th grade book,my son loves this author but I didn't give it to him because it's only about a 3rd grade book. not spending money on a book that he'd be done with in a day.
5,Humorous and Touching,"Sharon Creech is a master at young adult literature. This book had humor, emotion, and was an accurate depiction of families. It was also very touching. I really enjoyed it."
4,A pink and glittering collection,"""Shonen Knife - Millennium Edition"" is a decent ""Best of..."" collection, featuring the hits of everyone's favorite Japanese bubblegum punk girls. All of the songs on here are tops, representing what makes Shonen Knife so unique and wonderful. No one else sings silly songs about food in quite the same way. ""One Week"" in particular is a fun song, detailing a week in the life of Shonen Knife.The only drawback to this CD is that it contains only English-language songs, which may not be considered a drawback to everyone. However, some of Shonen Knife's best songs are in Japanese and any ""Best of..."" collection entirely in English is going to be incomplete.Also, ""All I Want For Christmas..."" is a great tune, and I believe this CD is one of the few places you fan find it. The cover of The Monkey's ""Daydream Believer"" is also a lot of fun. Too bad they didn't include their Carpenter's cover as well."
4,Good compilation CD,"Millenium Edition is a good over view of what the girls from Osaka have been up to for a few albums priror to bassist Michie Nakatani retiring from the band. It is a bit spendy for the avaerage person looking to get into Shonen Knife, but for Shonen Knife fans and completists we are used to paying a large chunk of cash for their cd's. As an FYI cd's in Japan are about 2-3 times as spendy as cd's in the states. Basically for the music companies to have the same profit margin in a market half the size they need to charge twice as much. Thnaks to my linguist friend Doug for giving me the Q-T on that.Back to the album. The addiotional tracks not found on their full length previous cd's Mysterious Drug Store and All I Want For Christmas are a mixed bad. Mysterious Drug Store is not a great song. All I want for Christmas is a great song the typifies what is so great about the band. Everything else on the CD is great, even if just a refresher of what they already have done."
3,Beginning to thrive,"This plant came strangely packaged in a old shoe box with no return address and no receipt inside. When I first received it, I was hesitant to open the box as I was suspicious of receiving an unidentified and battered parcel. Once I got past the packaging, the plant was of a nice size for the price. It did have a few flowers at first but I have not been successful with any flowers since. However, the plant is doing well, thriving with a vine twisting around the hanging planter handle. If the packaging had somehow identified where it came from or indicated what was inside, I would have rated this product with 5 stars."
1,DISAPPOINTED!!!!!!!!,"Ordered candy corn plant, plant was dehydrated to the point of wilted and dried. Could not revive the plant by spraying in putting in a pot of soil-has not revived. Very disappointed."
5,Laptop hard drive adapter,"Fantastic purchase - just what I needed when my laptop wouldn't boot any more. I just hooked this up to the spare IDE slot on my desktop, powered up, and there was a new drive with all my files on it. The hardest thing about any of this was figuring out how to unscrew the drive out of the laptop chassis - they bolt those things in pretty well."
5,"Excellent little toy for the ""Geek"" on the go!","""This adapter worked as advertised. I bought two of them and was able to clone my Western Digital drives for my laptop in a desk top with no problems. Excellent little toy for the ""Geek"" on the go."""
3,Not the right connector for me after all,"I bought this but then realized the connection part is different and cannot attach to the laptop hard drive I have, so I couldn't use it. Make sure your hard drive has this type of connection port before buying."
1,Dead on arrival,The adpter came on time but died the first time we used it. We had to reorder another to complete the job. Maybe it was just a lemon but we lost computer time. Bummer!
2,Adapter didn't work for my Laptop HD,"I connected my laptop HD up to my desktop using the IDE HD adapter because the laptop was dropped and wouldn't boot up. BIOS won't recognize it as an available drive. I tried it as the SLAVE HD. I finally got the desktop HD to boot up when setting the laptop HD to CABLE but it still wouldn't show up under Control Panel or Explore. It just clicks, I'm afraid I've lost all data. Any ideas?"
5,"Works great, sturdy",This product works as it claims. Good construction. Much sturdier than the PCB board adpater I replaced. Good price.
4,Who do we trust?,"Back Cover description: RAFIQ'S SECRET SON. Half Arab prince, half French, Rafiq Al-Qadim wears his pride like a suit of armor...as Melanie had discovered when she fell in love with him years ago. Then Rafiq chose to believe ugly lies about her, and blew her out of his life like a grain of desert sand in the wind...But Melanie will never stop wanting Rafiq--unbeknownst to him, she gave birth to his child. Now that Robbie is old enough to need his father, Melanie is determined Rafiq will accept his son...even if he can never forgive her....Good, tight story with strong characters. Interesting that the author doesn't/can't have the heroine prove her ""truth"". The hero has to take it on faith. Strong female lead, vulnerable and proud hero. Even the child's character was interesting and he didn't take over the story. Good read--try it."
3,AWESOME .,This is a classic from Michelle Reid. A part of a mini - series which started with the sheikh's chosen wife and Ethan's temptress bride.Very emotional and feels real. You will definetely Love it.
4,A Passionate filled book.,"""the Arabian Love-Child"" is the third book in a series by Michelle Reid. This is a great story. As I said said in my review of ""The Sheikh Chosen Wife #2254"" also by Ms. Reid it had been sometime since I read Harlequin Presents and they have really improved from what I remember. I really enjoyed this book. The reader is able to feel Melanie's pain and want to see her and Rafiq to work out their problems. A great book!"
4,Excellent Glasses,"These glasses are excellent for everyday and casual use. They are a perfect size for a glass of wine to accompany dinner. They are a great shape to hold in your hand and to store,"
5,Most Elegant Wine Glass,"I had a set of these wine glasses that I bought years ago because they are the most elegant, simple, free flowing, seductively curved wine glasses I have ever seen. Over the years they got broken here and there until I only had one left. I couldn't remember the name or where I got them. When I found them here I was elated! They are the perfect size and shape for me and I couldn't be happier!"
3,EVERY DAY WINE GLASS,"These glasses are the size I was looking for (not the gigantic water glasses now in style), but they are not graceful or fine. Good for every day, but I was a bit disappointed."
4,"Great Band, Great Future","These girls are going places. There songs are well crafted, melodic, and trashy when they have to be. They remind you of the girl that would never go out with you in highschool a bit, but are still awesome when it comes to music. The consist of Gemma- Drums, Alex- Guitar/Vocals, Sam- Bass/Vocals and Shelly- Guitar/Vocals. There vocals are beautiful, nowhere is this more evident then in the rapid fire change between layedback feel to thrash feel in 'Distinction'. Gemma can way hold her own as a drummer, she is fantastic. She gets to show off her chops with some awesome tom fills in 'Allergy', which is more subdued, as is Mountain. Overall, this single is a good buy, but if you're not really a hardcore fan, wait for the album. These girls can rock."
2,A flawed recording,"Midori is quite capable technically of playing all of these very difficult pieces, she is fluid and graceful (if passionless) but I have one major beef with this recording, there is very annoying ""tick"" sound throughout the recording. I'm not sure if this is something wrong with her bow or what, but it drove me crazy the first time I listened to it and I can't listen to it any more because of that. I can't believe that made it to the final recording. Try the Salvatore Accardo recordings, you've never heard such passion in violin playing, the man is possessed."
3,Like a walk down memory lane,"I just finished reading this book this weekend. As someone who grew up in the 70's, it brought back a lot of memories and reminded me about many things I had long forgotten, particularly the energy crisis. This book is filled with endless facts and statistics that put the 70's in its proper perspective. The only fault I could see was the numerous typos. There must have been at least 100 grammatical errors and typos. It does not look like anyone proofread this book."
4,"Deporable Decade, Good Book","I have always regarded the 1970s as a deplorable decade: foolish hairstyles and hideous clothes . . atrocious pop music (sadly, re-ascendant today in some quarters) . . . economic malaise . . . international terrorists and domestic anarchists run amok . . . America's prestige and global influence in eclipse, its military left to atrophy, its currency debased, and its loyal allies abandoned . . . energy ""crises"" exacerbated by our own government's policies . . . inflation and crime running rampant . . . the moral order eroded, replaced by a new culture of victimhood, entitlement and self-indulgence.What a mess! David Frum adroitly captures all this and more in his excellent, eloquent retrospective on the 1970s."
1,How We Got Here,"Chuck it. I'm embarrassed to have been seen reading this drivel. I unwittingly fell for the title and was aghast when I realized what I purchased. Luckily I picked it up at the discount store.Unfortunately, 1 star is the lowest I can rate the book. Amazon won't allow me to leave no stars."
1,PURE TRASH!,"The contents of this book is nothing more than one man's opinion, it is not based on common fact.The 70s and all the decades that preceded it is not the cause for today's problems. This current decade and the spoiled Baby Boomers running the country such as our moraless President is the cause of our current problems.I don't believe one can blame the 70s or any other decade for our current society.It's the people stupid.We are losing our common sense and values today,because hard work and doing the right thing is being replaced with how can I make easy money? This way of thinking DID NOT originate in the 70s.If this liberal writer wants to blame something,then maybe he should look at technology."
3,"Witty and irreverent, but not scholarly","I read this book as part of a graduate school class in recent American history. When compared to the works of professional scholarship we read for class, this book lacks much. It is not written in a scholarly tone, based mostly on secondary sources, and has quite a few rather obvious grammatical and typographical errors (who proofread this thing!?!?)That said, however, I did enjoy reading this book. It is at times laugh-out-loud funny and its point-of-view is definitely different from most works of history, which tend to be left of center. I would recommend it for the layman who is looking for a good overview of Seventies history from a conservative viewpoint. Professional historians or students of history should probably look elsewhere."
5,Thoroughly entertaining and enjoyable,"David Frum has gives a panoramic, at times disorienting view of the seventies. His digressions are never distracting, and he succeeds in giving needed context regarding the cultural, political, and economic changes that got their start in the 70's. Frum is insightful and evenhanded -- Republicans and Democratic politicians alike are critiqued. What surprised me about the book wasn't how shrewd Frum was, it was what a delightful read the book was. This is not preaching to the conservative faithful, like, say Ann Coulter's ""Slander."" He's closer to David Brooks in temperament -- funny, compassionate, and unfailingly observant. It's a book that deserves to be read widely."
3,The 70's - but through whose lenses?,"While, as they say in Congress, reserving the right to revise and extend my remarks, I'll briefly give Mr. Frum a mixed review.The book is quite entertaining and generally well-written (although the last few chapters seemed to provide a bit of info overload). But about halfway through the book I began to feel a bit manipulated by the writer, and as I concluded, I came to the realization that this book, fun to read as it was, has a most definite self-righteous angle and as a political moderate I found myself questioning just how objective the supportive material was."
2,There Is No Here Here,"To paraphrase Gertrude Stein, there is no ""Here"" in this book. When the book is entitled ""How We Got Here"" I expect to get thoughtful insights linking what happened in the '70s to the world we're dealing with as the century turns. There is little or none of that, so what's the point? I've read histories of the '70s before (cf. Peter Carroll's ""It Seemed Like Nothing Happened""). Add to that some sloppy spelling, fact-checking, grammar, and tenuous reasoning, and you've got a real disappointment on your hands."
1,Biting the hands that fed him,A small man with a glib sense of pop culture not backed by true scholarship. Why did George Bush allow this man into the inner sanctum?
3,A Right Wing Polemic,"Oh to see social life in such black and white terms! All evil, stupidity, and goofiness is the fault of liberals (which includes all boomers, activist judges, gays, economists, professors, unions, envionmentalists, and assorted fellow travelors). All that is right, good and true is due to staunch conservatives (Republicans). Still, it is an interesting world view (despite the typos)."
3,"So you go 'round the corner, you just walk along, sing a song.","This was the third album released by the reclusive Jandek. It is similar in sound to his first two albums, but there is some ""artistic growth"". This is the first album on which he plays harmonica, although not particularly well. And it is also his first (only?) album to be in stereo. It is primitive two-track stereo, with his vocals and harmonica in the left channel, and his guitar in the right channel. Other than that, it's the same old Jandek. The few people that like his music will enjoy this album, everyone else will hate it."
3,"Works fine, but not my favorite","This is a nice watch-pocket size compass, but it's a little hard to read especially in low-light conditions. The Brunton - Trooper, Pin-On Mirrored Sighting Compass is slightly smaller but has larger, clearer markings and more & larger luminous dots in all the right places.That said, I think this compass is reliable and about as accurate as a little compass should be, plus or minus five degrees. It takes up very little room in a belt pack, and it's enough to get me back to my car after a day hike. I like the pin-on feature, I actually use that to keep myself on transect on archaeological surveys.I prefer the Brunton Trooper because I can read it at a glance, whereas I have to squint carefully at the Silva 427."
5,Great CD,"Several years ago I had this CD on cassette. I loved it so much that I was happy when I found it on Amazon (used). Interesting mixture of music and is nice background for reading, cooking or for parties."
4,Works as advertised (a cool gadget),"This is one of the 'only' usb wi-fi adapters that currently supports Mac OS X.For folks that have aging apple hardware (older powerbooks, ibooks, iMacs etc;) its nice to have a working/supported solution out there!Instructions aren't exactly straightforward, but the software/drivers for Mac OS X can be downloaded directly from the ZyXEL website."
2,"Has its uses, but not for me","I was looking for a wireless device that I could take on travel that would allow my iPod Touch and my laptop to communicate. This seemed like it could be the thing. I found it to be too complex to try to configure - couldn't get it to allow communications between the iPod and the PC. I returned it and purchased the D-Link DWL-G730AP Wireless Pocket Router for about the same price. It does exactly what I want - gives me a standalone wireless network on which the laptop and iPod can both reside.The reason I went for the ZyXEL first was because I wanted something compact and light - space and weight are the enemy when you travel with only a carry-on. The D-Link looks bulky, with its case and AC adapter and cables. But it turns out all I have to carry is the little-bitty router and very short USB cable for its power. Weighs nothing, about the size of a chocolate-chip cookie."
4,"Works fine, wish it was smaller","Does everything it's supposed to do reliably.I wish it was smaller and had a key chain loop. It's too big to carry around on a key chain. I'd gladly give up the wireless adapter feature for that.There are other smaller WiFi detectors out there that can go on a key chain easily, but they don't provide the detailed info this unit does."
3,Zzebra - 'Take It Or Leave It' (Disconforme),"To avoid any possible confusion, this (obviously) isn't the '80's U.S. power trio - I've actually made that mistake before when I search the Internet (or even stores) for CD's that I want. Zzebra was a UK jazz fusion band from the UK - putting out four lp's 1975-76. This is the band's third, and a decent one at that. Tunes here that I liked more than I expected I would were ""Poverty Song"", the seven-minute creative ""Bai La Jo"" and the upbeat title track ""Take It Or leave It"". Line-up: Alan Marshall - vocals, Steve Byrd (Gillan) - guitar, John McCoy (also, of Gillan) - bass, Dave Quincy - sax, Tommy Eyre - keyboards and Liam Genockey - drums. Might draw in fans of - say Pierre Moerlen's or Mani Neumeier."
1,They suckered me,"In the 1970s I bought an LP by Zzebra that had this one's cover and I remember it being quite good. I didn't remember the track names, but I naturally assumed that this was the one. But the label has slapped the cover I remember on this, the ""unreleased album,"" which I find to be thoroughly awful."
1,Very disapointing...,"Not well sealed for all weather purposes. Then I dropped on the front lawn and it broke. This product was a big disappointment. Good for a light to keep under the kitchen sink, that's about it. Next I will check before buying another Chinese flashlight."
1,Completely disappointing,"When I first slipped these shoes on my feet they were so comfortable. Four wearings laters, the heel tip on the left shoe was gone and the entire top edge of the toe bed was scuffed on both shoes. The day I came home walking on the metal peg in the heel, those shoes went right in the trash. Should have sent them back."
4,Love these shows,Super comfortable and very stylish for a brand that has always been a bit stodgy and old fashioned. May have to buy other colors along with the navy....
2,Nice color maps.... crappy information,"Not worth your money, unless you are forced to use it for class, in which case you may need it in order to get the dates right for class (since they vary from book to book). You are basically paying for pretty color maps in the middle of the book and high quality paper. I would suggest getting supplemental books to help you through class if you need this as a text book."
4,Good for a hanging water bag,The cap gives a good flow of water when I use it on my 10 liter bag. No water dripping when turned off. The little cap at the tip actually stops water from spilling if you accidentally turn the tap on during transportation.
3,Lacking Details on Engineering and Family Life,"The interest for reading the book was to learn the man behind bringing water to Los Angeles that led to making it one of the most known cities in the world. As much as Ms. Mullholland stated the projects her grandfather William did, it lacked details in laypersons terms the design features that made them among the world's great engineering feats. You wonder if the author was hiding family secrets. She only tells of the names of her wife and children, never giving much about their lives. At most she mentions her grandmother's illness that led to her death."
3,Nightpool,I read Nightpool the other day and I love it! I had read the other books in this series before this one and I was so suprised that there was another one in the series. Nightpool is the first one. Then there's The Dragonbards and The Ivory Lyre. They are all great books and I hope she writes more.
5,"awsoe, nothing like it!!!!!!!!!","I found this in the school libray, and i was amazed! all other books didnt have enough action, most in which the character is weaker than a slug, while shirley gives it an edge that makes you want to read more. Tolkien, lewis, morris, ive never seen a better autor until i found this book on the dusty side of the shelves. its intresting, with lots of details, and a easy understandible plot with twists and turns that get your brain thinking. read this book its awsome."
4,Penentrating Book,"This is quite a good book that really allows the reader to get behind the author and penetrate the subject matter in a slow, moving way. There are quite a few elements of humor in it, one of which lead to a friend of mine who was walking the streets of NY fall into a manhole while I was reading it on the phone to him (he was o.k.). The book ends with quite an explosive passage that might make many gag, but, for this reader, I swallowed it up.I highly recommend this book."
4,Definitely not a rental!,"During my reading I found myself saying ""Hey, I've been there."" a great deal. It is a honest and humorous look at many aspects of the gay world. It is wonderful to finally see a book about what it is like for, let us say, a more ""mature"" man to come to terms with who he is. If you are gay I know you'll find yourself identifying with a great deal of what Mr. Brown is saying. If you are straight, you will get a good account of what the coming out experience is like and an insight into gay ""education"". I hope this is not Mr. Brown's last book!"
5,Clear sheet protectors,Fine product...Should have gone to Sam's who had the same item for about half the price. I'll know next time
2,"Not Very ""Heavyweight""","These say they're ""Heavyweight - Presentation"" quality but I would keep shopping. They are very thin and the three-ring binding looks like it will tear easily. I have purchased dozens of cases of Avery sheet protectors in years past and have never seen some of such low quality as these. Would not buy them again. Did not have time to return as they were for school supplies."
2,not very helpful,"book is slightly dated. helpful for someone just beginning the adoption process to share with family/friends, but otherwise not something I would recommend."
3,"A Good Procedural in London's ""Second City""","Overall, I liked this book, particularly the detail Butler put into the Second City universe and the care she used in portraying the novel's characters. Some of the segues from scene to scene were interesting in an almost cinematic way, and I appreciated how it enhanced the story line.I thought, however, that some of the clues should have clicked together in Coffin's mind long before they did, instead of being saved for a somewhat rushed wrap-up at the novel's end. Other than that, my only complaints are Butler's indulgence in confusing head-hopping and annoying comma-spliced sentences."
4,The best CCNA book for certification.,"Although I am a reviewer for Cisco Press, I have found that the Sybex book series is much more understandable for the average person trying to achieve their CCNA certification. I teach the IT Mentor 2 Day CCNA Boot Camp and have used this book for the last 5 years. Over 5,000 of my students have used this book!The only negative I have is that there are generally more errors in the first few editions of the Sybex books."
3,Sqeaked by with an 850,"I used this book solely to study for the CCNA (2nd attempt). By the time I finished this book, I was able to master the practice tests on the enclosed CD. I found the actual CCNA questions to be much harder than the Sybex practice quetions. My coworkers used the Cisco Press books and passed easily. Todd Lammle's book is a great resource for learning subnetting; which is crucial to success on the CCNA. I would recommend the book for CCNA prep, but not as a sole resource."
2,Up to page 30 but getting frustrated,When Todd tries to explain the Data Link layer of the OSI model it is totally confusing. Up to this point his explanations have been ok. I think he may have left out an important diagram or something because it has totally baffled me! He refers to Figure 1.13 but this figure is back three pages and is totally unrelated.And the way he explains things makes you think that he was in a rush or that English is his second language.I'll post another review if I am convinced otherwise.
1,Leaves Things Clear as Mud,"I gave up on this book after the 3rd chapter, which fails to explain subnetting. Instead of explaining subnetting step-by-step (starting with counting in binary), the author goes off on a tangent describing a very confusing ""short-cut"" to subnetting that left me scratching my head and saying ""What the?"". Then he goes off on another tangent showing you how to subnet in your head. Is he insane?!? No other source I have read even attempts to teach you subnetting in your head."
1,CCNA Study Guide Rip Off!,"There seems to be a lot of sales hype in the form of apparent 'customers' recommending this with testimonials, but I've found the materials are incomplete and loaded with errors; the testimonials are obviously bogus! Then comes the added insult of trying to communicate, but Mr. Lammle refuses to try to correct his materials, or even discuss this; no, he has 'banned' criticism! Beware!"
5,My Best Cisco book!,"I have the Cisco Press and I was suggested in my Cisco Academy class to by the Sybex book because the Cisco books are soooo hard to read.I am NOT disapointed! This is the best technical book I have every read!!I now understand subnetting and how IP addressing works.This book is a great addition to the Cisco Academy or any class corriculm. We also use the RouterSim software, which is much easier to use then the Cisco labs we use in class."
3,Good book. Make sure to check for errata.,"Todd Lammle's book was a huge reason why I passed this test 5 years ago (when it was 640-407), so I have a great deal of respect for his knowledge and ability to present the material.I'm currently using this book to study for recertification, and I must say I'm a little disappointed. The book seems to have been a little rushed, due to some spotty errors and peculiar grammar (though that didn't bother me so much). Page 152 alone has two review questions (#'s 11 and 13) which are impossible to solve correctly due to oversights on the part of Lammle and his editors. I don't mean to sound nitpicky, but if I were a beginner, I would feel increasingly uneasy with Lammle with every error I encountered.Having said that, the man knows his stuff, and he has always done a great job of putting himself in the shoes of the reader, and putting extra emphasis on concepts that Cisco wants their CCNA's to know. (...)"
2,Not nearly enough for exam,"The exam I took had a lot a questions about NAT which were not covered with enough detail in the book. This book covers cursory items that, while interesting, are not on the exam. I would recommend it only for light reading. Some of the answers were incorrect, even had typos or references to routers in diagrams that didn't exist.I should have skipped the book.If you already do some of this type of work, and can use Cisco's CCNA prep site, and can use a sim (or your own routers), you'll be in better shape for the exam (in my humble opinion.)"
5,"Not just for certification, practical too.","This book is great for explaining the practical side of subnetting, and configuring switches and routers.Read Stevesn and Perlman to learn the theoritical and design concepts, and read this book to learn how to implement networks, switches and routers."
3,"Too flimsy, but kids like capes","Love the idea, and the hat is adorable, but the cape is cheap and looks like it will break soon, has already snagged in spots. I would hit a fabric store and try to make a cape myself. The entire set would be worth it for $15, but for $25 it's not such a good deal. Keep looking."
2,its a good laugh,"For one the book costs way too much for what it is.You won't become an embalmer from reading this. Get your gloves on and get your hands dirty. Very much aimed for the American audience. If your your anywhere else in the world where the deceased have been dead for a week or two this will be no help at all. Very good if you want your nan to look like a clown.Some good points to be made. If your in house and got all day to embalm 1 then this could prove useful. If your trade and got 8 to do in a day, forget it.Lots of American legal info.A real embalmer from England..."
4,Not As Expected,"I bought this cover to fit my Brother MFC440CN All-In-One. When I first pulled the cover out of the box I had trouble figuring out how to put it on my printer. I expected to just drop the cover over the printer like my previous dust cover. However, I had to lift my printer up which was a bit ackward to do and put the cover on with the bottom of the cover under the front of the printer. When I need to use the printer I have to pull the cover from the back to the front and roll it down like a pair of pants leaving the bottom of the cover still tucked under the front of the printer. While that's not a major problem, I did expect the cover to fit differently. That's why I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5. Overall, the fit is good considering the cover is a bit larger than my actual printer. I would recommend the item given how hard it is to even find dust covers these days. It will protect your item and that's what matters most."
1,It did not fit my printer as advertised,I returned it for a refund. I would not recommend this item. I decided to tape up the tear in my old cover and use it instead of a new one.
5,A TRUE ORIGINAL,"A Voice like Mandy's only comes once. I am a braodway lover and I rank Mandy in my top three, including Colm Wilkonson and Anthony Warlow. Sorry but Crawford is just another good braodway singer. Patinkin has a voice from heaven and you should hear it."
1,A Second Listening,"After listening to this album for the first time, I wrote a scathing little review. I have just listened to this album again, to see if I might have been wrong. After all, one's opinions change, and what sounds atrocious and just downright awful on one listening can be, well, if not good, then at least not a horrifying experience.Well, after the second trip through this album, I can say that I was absolutely right the first time. Mandy Patinkin has the ugliest voice yet to be recorded. It goes from hair-raising vibrato shrieks to hateful nasal braying.Twice is enough. This nauseating CD will never defile my stereo again. Why listen to Mandy Patinkin, when I can listen to a powerdrill and get the same effect?"
5,5 Stars plus 5 more!,"Quite simply put - the man is a genius - I agree that you either love or hate his voice, but no one can deny that he puts all his heart and soul into every song he sings.He is pure talent, and doesn't compromise his talent by conforming to some type of idea put out by producers.He is the best!"
1,Many issues,"When removing backing little patches of papper would remain and could not be removed making that section useless. Roll with given stock number was 24 x 50 inches. My husband suggested I should have tryed blow drying it before peeling it for esaier peeling. It was a good suggestion but I did not try it as I had already returned the product. I was able to get a small enough section to test on a photo and it seemed to work well enough, however it is not useful on the larger scale I had bought it for. Buyer beware."
1,Poor Product,"The backing will not pull off cleanly. I'm currently looking for another self adhesive product. Pay the extra, because this product is going into the trash."
4,Good stuff to have on hand,"This material will protect and preserve your documents and photos well. Also available in sheet size for general use, this roll is more versatile. Maps and other large items need this size. Care must be taken in application for it has to be done right the first time or very undesirable wrinkles will be permanent. Make sure you have a good work surface and plenty of hands."
1,HORRIBLE,This lamination paper is horrible! I can't get the backing off and when I do the backing separates and the lamination tears. Don't waste your money on this! I wish I hadn't spent $38 on it! Horrible stuff! Can't even get one project done with it!
2,It worked but barely.,Impossible to remove back unless to cut it up into strips. Bought this product to laminate 6 posters about 24 in by 18 in. This product is very large and I still have plenty left over so the amount was good. But the product was to hard to separate from the paper backing. I finished my project as best as I could but had to use two inch strips instead of covering the entire poster at once.
1,Bad product,The backing will not come off even if you get it started. It tears part way through the removal. For the price I expected a lot better especially from Avery.
1,poor product,AVERY SELF ADHESIVE LAMINATE ROLL DID NOT PULL AWAY FROM THE PAPER BACKING PROPERLY THAT IS IF YOU COULD EVEN GET IT STARTED. THE LAMINATE LEFT LOTS OF MARKS AND EVEN CRACKED WHEN I TRIED TO REMOVE THE BACKING. I WOULD NOT RECOMEND IT AT ALL.
4,Almost perfect,My daughter wanted this product to attempt to make a dry erase poster. It will work with certain markers but not with others. It is easy to use and I am finding plenty of uses for the laminate she didn't use for her project. Delivery from Amazon was prompt and the laminate was packaged very well.
1,Utter frustration,"Someone gave me a left over piece of laminate which worked beautifully. The paper peeeled off cleanly, the plastic was thick and strong.And the name Avery was on the back. So I looked up Avery on line and ordered my own roll. It is defective. It won't peel off, paper tears, plastic tears.All the rolling tricks don't work. I WANT TO RETURN IT AND GET A ROLL WHICH HAS THE QUALITY I EXPECTED BUT DON'T KNOW HOW. Maybe the original product is good but quality control is lousy and I am ruining my art pieces trying to deal with it. Judith"
2,Mission impossible!,"Cheapest way to laminate = YES!Hardest way to laminate = YES!Result = far from professionalMy husband and I tried together to laminate large posters. It took us hours, and it was so difficult to line the laminate to the poster, and to avoid bubbles as you go! Out of 10 posters we double laminated, may be 3 came out nice. The rest was ok to horrible!This product suits probably smaller projects, but I haven't touched it since, so I could not confirm that!"
1,Easy peel back not so easy!,"I ordered this to laminate some larges maps 20 x 36. However, the back will not peel it leaves a small thin layer of the white backing that is impossible to get off. Not very happy with this Avery product, usually very pleased with avery, but not this."
4,"The book is great, I almost cryed at the end.","Bull Catcher has made me love Baseball. I wish i could find books very similar to it, but with a finished ending, as you reach the last couple of pages, you have so many questions, and so little answers. I wish the author would start a similar sotry, but turn it in to a saga, that continues with a new title every month or so. I'm 14. Thanks Alden R. Carter, this was a great book, so was your last book, Between a Rock and A Hard Place.Erik"
3,a sure catch for baseball fans,"bull catcher is a story about a boy named neil (bull) larson and his freind jeff who live to play baseball and nothing but baseball, and try to get into the majors. along the way they meet up with new people like ngo phuong, who is an awesome pitcher with almost no control on his arm, and beth, the sister of a boy who neil had accidently broke his nose in A game. When they reach high school, bull and phuong is selected into the varsity team but jeff was not, but things changed and there was an empty slot on the varsity team and then jeff got onto the varsity team. later on the team made it to the finals, but because of the bull, the lost the game and because he couldnt live with himself, instead of playing in the summer league, he became a counsler at a summer camp. over there he meets up with bev again who's another counseler, and finds out that there was a trajedy while he was gone."
4,it a pretty good book,bull catcher is a pretty good book it starts out realy good but the reason why i only rated this book a 4 was because at the end just because that collage said he was to slow he didnt try to make it to the pros he shouldve tried to make it any way i mean thats kinda i week way to go out
4,A lukewarm two thumbs up,A good recording; but why did we need it? There can be no competition with the magnificent Mefistofele of Cezare Siepi on the recording also featuring such luminaries as Mario del Monaco and Renata Tebaldi.
1,Do Not Buy This Book,"I have been fixing up older homes for many years and this is the worst book I have ever read on the subject. This author's opinions are a detriment to all older homes. He has a section devoted to how to hang a bunch of Victorian stuff on a non-Victorian house and states that any bathroom built before 1930 has no redeeming values and should be gutted. Furthermore, what he states as facts are totally wrong. For example, he says that the Craftsman period began in 1915. (Gus Stickley went out of business in 1916.) For the respect of all older homes I strongly recomend that you do not buy this book."
3,"A pleasant diversion, but nothing more","Stephen Kendrick enters the Holmes pastiche realm with this meeting of Holmes and Father Brown. Creating a murder mystery set at a secretive international religious conclave, Kendrick sets an interesting table. Populated with familiar characters (Mycroft, Lestrade, Watson) and using the clever excuse that this was Watson's undiluted (by Doyle) account; Kendrick creates a page turner. But the little errors kept nagging at me. Like when Holmes states he never caught the Ripper because ""he was too random, impulsive and totally haphazard,"" then in the next paragraph Holmes says, ""The odder the murder, the easier it is to solve."" The Ripper murders were not odd? Later Kozan, the Buddhist monk, compliments Holmes twice on his familiarity with Buddhist principles. Did he forget the first conversation? I'm usually not that much of a nitpicker but these types of errors interfered with my enjoyment of this book."
4,such an oddball story,"This becomes such an oddball story. It touches a lot on religion, though, the main characters are admittedly not believers. It has Sherlock's brother, Mycroft, involved, though he is reputed to refrain from leaving his club. It also has Sherlock not truly solving the crime, though he does get it mostly right. I had a hunch the solution was what it was from the beginning, which makes this story a bit obvious.Sherlock and Watson are tapped to solve a crime in a church. The church was holding a secret meeting of religious persons from around the world and the host priest is murdered. Mycroft is there as an adjunct to the police from the government (he is so important).After reading the story, I read that the author is a priest, so the religious side became obvious."
4,Well done panache of Holmes and Father Brown,"If you like Conan Doyle's Holmes and G. K. Chesterton's Father Brown you should like this story of a meeting between them, one that manages to honor both of them."
3,Not What I Was Looking For,"This book had varied stories of several family's experiences with the school district, or not, and their adventures in homeschooling. It definitely strengthened my resolve to homeschool.My complaint is that, from the title, I thought this would cover all parts of the spectrum more fully. Nine out of the eleven stories, if I counted right, were about children with Asperger's! These children usually did fairly well in the school district but better at home, which is not our situation. I was looking for more information on homeschooling children with autism, with more limited capabilites."
5,Excellent book,"This is the best book I've found about homeschooling my special needs child. The best because we learn not only why but also how twelve different families homeschool their special needs child - twelve different children and twelve different approaches and ways of homeschooling. The book does indeed demonstrate that ""paths are made by walking"" and that everyone has their own path which they discover on their journey.I would recommend this book to anyone with a child with autism or Asperger's syndrome who is experiencing difficulties in school, as well as to anyone who is already homeschooling to see how others are doing it."
2,Run Amok,"Nemec provided me with some of cinema's most sublime 60s cinema, and this in a very fertile period of European product. 'Diamonds of the Night' remains a cherished experience. But then came the Fall and, as we discover in this film, Nemec, when confronted by the Russians with the prospect of internment or enforced exile, opted for the latter, and settled in America. It was a decision that unhinged Nemec, certainly on the evidence submitted on this film. Nemec's courage to tell all in this rambling reconstruction is to be applauded. But only the most devout follower of his work would claim it as much more than this."
5,The best sheet protectors I could find,"I'm military and get a lot of ""documents"" and certifications for training and such. I needed to be able to keep these documents in a location, protected and yet able to be used. I did a lot of hands on research looking for something durable, strong, heavy weight and would protect my important documents. These worked perfectly. I would recommend these for any product you care to keep."
4,Heavy duty indeed!,"There is nothing wrong with these protectors, they do their job well. I guess my slight disappointment is my own fault. I wanted these to protect letters so I would only be putting one sheet in a single protector. It almost feels like a waste with these heavy duty pieces since they're capable of holding up to 10 sheets at a time. Well, my letters will be extra protected then because its not a problem worthy of returning. Just keep in mind that although these are clear, there is a sort of frosted effect compared to regular light weight sheet protectors."
4,great sleeves,"These sleeves have met my needs just fine. They're decent quality and cheap. If you plan to use them every day, you might care more about specific size, durability, and readability. However, for my more limited use, they don't show any signs of breaking, they can easily hold several normal pages, and they're easy to read through."
3,Works well,These protectors work well and are quite sturdy. But I do prefer the ones that are a bit lighter in weight and textured.
5,Great way to keep important documents neat and clean,These covers are excellent. Ink does not stick to them when you pull something out. Easy to use. Great way to keep papers together in binders or file folders.
2,I found this item to be of poor quality.,Found item to be of poor quality - not what I was looking fo. Cover was cloudy - not see through. Returned item.
2,"Self-Conscious, Contrived, Annoying Opera","The orchestra is fine, the arrangements of operatic music for instruments, without voices, are fine. But the conductor (Andre Kostelanetz) tries to make the non-vocal music sound even more melodramatic than when sung. The result is very self-consciously contrived, as though a person who views the music with no heart and no soul tries to make the music sound as though it has heart and soul. The dynamics (volume changes) and tempos are so tortuously stretched that they become almost unlistenably annoying, at least to me.I have several other recordings of non-vocal arrangements and transcriptions of operatic music that I like (one of my favorites is ""Aria,"" operatic arrangements for clarinet played by Richard Stoltzman) but this audio disk goes to the bottom of the pile, to sell to a used CD buyer/reseller."
3,Disappointed,"The orchestra information on the CD does not match that on the Amazon website. Only item 22 seems to be by the New York Philharmonic. Items 1-7 which the website says are by that orchestra are by the Andre Kostelanetz Orchestra and items 11-21 have no orchestra name, but seem to be by the Andre Kostelanetz Orchestra. OK as background music."
4,Opera Soul,The songs were ones that I like and I'm not sorry I bought it but I have better versions of the same music. This CD is better than average but I would not give it as a gift if I had it in mind for someone else.
2,"Rubber head stains hands, looks worn","The rubber head of this reflex hammer looks crudely fashioned and stained my hands when I examined it. The handle, however, is fine...sturdy with a pointed handle more than adequate to elicit a Babinski reflex."
2,A misrepresentation,"As an amateur cello player, who picked up an instrument for the first time 3 years ago, I looked to this book for inspiration and enlightenment. It is represented as an amateur exploration of music, the discovery of real music later in life. Fact in point, the author is an amateur only in the sense that he does not tour or get paid to play his instrument. However we quickly learn that this author has been playing one instrument or another since childhood, and could at one point almost have made it as a clarinetist. This book quickly turns into a ""dig me"" diatribe which left me in disagreement with the author: despite his best efforts, I was not ultimately convinced that he was a ""cool guy"" -- which is really all he's trying to communicate. For my purposes, this book was unmitigated tripe."
4,Works like the orginial,"Needed a replacement for my original GameCube console. This has worked great with no issues.Unfortunately, I can't say the same for the AV cord that I purchased from another website. Well, you get what you pay for sometimes, I guess."
3,"not the same one i ordered, but it's working fine for now","I ordered this AC adapter and after reading the reviews, I felt confident in my purchase, but I received a completely different adapter and I was disappointed when I got it. This adapter has worked so far though so no complaints yet!"
1,Marvel's Shoddy workmanship,"As with the other reviewers here I'm not going to talk about the comics themselves. The stories are fine but don't spend your money on these shoddy TPBs. This is not the only book of this series (glossy paper, black and white spine) that has come aprt on first read. I can't imagine why Marvel used such poor quality materials but BUYER BEWARE. Clearly this isn't isolated to either my edition or this title. Stay away and find editions with paper pages. In my experience they last. In fact, Marvelite though I am, DC collected editions are far superior in this regard."
5,An epic story of southern grandness and madness,"This is the 3rd book I have read by Ms. Siddons, and so far the best. I am looking forward to reading every book she has written now, and intend to do so. I hope more people get a chance to experience this little-known early novel by this author. Ms. Siddons has wonderful descriptive powers and sense of location, and makes you feel as if you are right there experiencing the events along with the characters."
2,"For me, very disappointing","Wow! I'm astonished that everyone else liked this so much. For me, watching Ruth Yancey Fox ruthlessly destroy the lives of everyone in her family was just too depressing. I probably wouldn't have even finished this if I hadn't been on vacation. I thought Ruth should have had her comeuppance a lot earlier in the story, and then there would have been a LITTLE more joy and happiness instead of grinding misery for the whole damn book. I also thought the depiction of the black servants was a bit racist and patronizing. (The old warmhearted-but-dimwitted stereotype.)"
4,A truly terrible woman was Ruth,"After reading ""Downtown"" I had almost decided never to read another of Siddons' books but since I had some in my reading supply decided to try again. Was fascinated and horrified with ""Ruth"". In her early years one has profound pity and sorrow for her but as she grew older was hard to believe one person could cause so much pain for others when she had lived thru so much of itherself. Thought it a bit slow at times but now, as I have only ten pages left to read, wish it could go on and on.Glad I have read it as now will continue reading more of Siddons books."
2,like being slowly dragged through destruction,"Disappointing Siddons. A depressing story of one demented woman destroying everyone around her. No matter how well written, it is still depressing to the end. Save your money unless you like to read detailed descriptions of madness leading to grief and loss and destroyed lives."
2,Ugh,"I wish I could have liked just one character besides Rip who was almost too saintly until the end. This book was very disappointing, and I really wanted to quit reading, but I soldiered on and laughed out loud at the last paragraph. Siddons can do better. She usually is so good at creating a place that becomes real and vivid. Fox's Earth was only a shell that housed madness and cruelty. The book was too long. The location did not become a character as in so many of her other works."
2,"Not her best, by far!","I agree with Jeff. The overuse of the ""N"" word was unnecessary and racist, and Ruth Yancey Fox ruining life after life for over 300 pages was just about too much to endure."
3,"Gorgeous writing, disturbing book","This book wins points for the sheer beauty of the prose - Ms. Siddons's words flow like poetry, and I loved the book's beginning in spite of the brutality of Ruth's father and the horrible circumstances of her life (although I had to wonder about her four siblings; they seemed not to be there at all). I made it through her adoption, her marriage, her horrendous labor/childbirth, all the while becoming more put off by her self-centered wickedness, but when she destroyed the beautiful lady who had given her a chance for a decent life, I said 'enough's enough'. I'll take a pass on the rest of the book."
2,Skip it!,"I bought this book thinking it was a guaranteed good read by one of my favorite authors. I really wanted to like it, but I ended up throwing it in the trash after reading 1/3 of it. Usually Siddons' books have characters that I care about, but in this book they were all weak, evil, stupid people. That Ruth could get away with her evil antics completely unchallenged only frustrated me. Skip this one if it's not too late."
1,No Vista support,"Unbelievably, this device does not support Vista. I confirmed this with a ""customer advocacy"" rep from IOGear. They are ""working on it"" but have no idea when a solution will be available. They claim it's not their fault because the product came out before Vista was available; they obviously don't even know that Vista compatibility programs for manufacturers were available for more than a year before its release. If the company is this incompetent, I'd advise not buying *any* of their products."
2,Can't use it with Mac OS,"IOGear's website says this speakerphone works with Macs, but it's not true. At least, I tried it on two different Macs running Mac OS 10.4.8 and the sound that comes out is garbage, sounds like you're speaking underwater. Works fine on Windows, but that's not the point.I emailed and called IOGear and first got the runaround -- ""you must be overdriving the unit"" -- but then they told me it is known not to work with Mac OS 10.4 and there's no ETA for a fix."
1,Save your money,The first unit I bought the DVD door would not open. I returned it to Sears and got another unit. After 13 months it quit recording on DVD. I am going to replace with another unit and it sure will not be Sylvania.
1,I wouldn't buy this machine,"Once I got this home I found in the instruction book, hidden, that the player/recorder would only accept 4 brands of dvd's, no matter the format. What I found out is that it doesn't accept all of one brand. I bought Maxell like it suggested and then it would only dub and record to the yellow colored dvd's. Maxell is hard to find in the stores and the yellow ones were very expensive. I just wanted to dub my hundreds of VHS home recordings to dvd's for easier storage. But no, it won't accept anything but the yellow Maxell. I'm clueless as to the different colors and what they mean and the manual doesn't explain this.Save your money, frustration, and a headache."
1,I'd have given no stars if I could,"I am not a review writer, but I want to warn anyone away from this piece of junk. I have never had an electronic device that broke after less than a year until now. First the clock stopped working - making it impossible to timer - record anything. Next, the thing just started spitting out DVD's and VCR tapes while we were in the middle of watching, it would just turn itself off and eject the movie. Now it no longer records on the DVD side, and you can't rewind VCR tapes anymore. Of course this all began about a week after the warrantee expired. We are not heavy users of this device, so this really was either just a lemon, or the product is defective. Will never buy anything Sylvania again."
5,Great Item!!,I love this easy to use DVD recorder. I got it out the box and was ready to use it right away. I was first intimidated by all of the instructions. But there is a fast set up intructions also and off I went.
4,dvd/vhs recorder,Just got this today and am amazed with the ease of set up have recorded 1 dvd so far with no problems.Will add more later as i have alot of movies to copy
1,Stop working in less than 5 months; Really good when working.,"Unit worked flawlessly for about 5 months after purchase; Purchase the unit in January/2006. However, it just stopped working. The DVD door does not open at all. It reads open, close, load, but the door never opens. It attempts to load, but of course, there isn't a DVD in there.When working, it is a pretty good unit; however, buyers beware. There is something wrong with this unit. Like others, was totally satisfied in the beginning; but the beginning came to an abrupt ending.Beware. Beware. Beware."
1,WORST DVD VCR combo,DO NOT BUY THIS. IT stop working after 4 months ! Its not worth the money ! I made a decision of buying this after reading the great reviews ! BIG MISTAKE. I still have another dvd/ vcr combo that I bought 3 years ago. Mintek. And it still work .
4,Sylvania DVR90VF DVD Recorder/VCR Combo,"As far as DVD Recorder/VCR Combo's go, This model is the best bang for your buck. These recorder combo's are fairly new to the market and they all have some bug's, So why spend $ 250 $ 300 dollars when most of them rate only 3 1/2 stars or less. This is a very easy unit to set up with a very fine DVD picture and fair VCR picture. Great price $ 185, And clear manual instruction's. Do your home work, Read and follow the entire instruction manual and this unit works like a charm. Sylvania also has a 1-800 help line if you need it and they back their product."
1,Piece of junk! Steer clear...,"This unit is a piece of junk! $200 dollar mistake. Almost since new I get frequent error code 4 messages that says it cannot record to this disc. The discs are fine and work in other devices. It's hit or miss and usually, it's a miss! VHS recording quality has been poor since new and the rewind is so loud it makes you want to go running out of the room! I contacted Sylvania and all they had to offer was that I should try cleaning it. That of course did not fix the problem. Never again will I buy another Sylvania product. Steer clear of this overpriced door stop!"
2,Late Delivery,"I ordered the item on 8 Jan 2006. The advertising stated that the item would usually be shipped within 24 hrs. My tracking info tells me that the item will be shipped on the 13th of Jan., and I can expect to receive the item on 17-19 Jan. This is not good advertising or customer relations. I thought Amazon was a trusted outfit??"
1,Not good if you like Quality,"I bought this dvd player, after sizing it up to other higher priced dvd recorder combos, and of course went with this- the picture drops almost evertime you want to record a dvd- meaning, your dvd is being recorded but very noticable lines come through the dvd and then goes blank screen while the audio is still there- Its very bad- I took it back and they told me that it does not get sold a lot because of complaints like mine. Its nice, if you do not plan to record dvd's- jus letting u kno so u dont make the same mistake is i did."
1,DIDN'T EVEN LAST ONE YEAR,"I bought two of these machines -- one for myself, one for my dad. Both have conked out in less than a year. At first, the recorder starts skipping while recording. Then, it starts skipping while you are playing a disc -- any disc. Then (for my dad), it stops recording at all. Unfortunately, the warrantee only covers one year for parts, while the labor guarantee expires after three months. I will never buy anything from Sylvania, again."
1,Drops programming,"The unit drops programming. When this happened I got a new one an the same thing happened. I program two different shows to record - at totally different times and days - but any program above line #1 disssapears! Funai has never heard of this but I'm betting there's a bad lot of these sitting on store shelves this spring, 2006. Beware."
1,Broken after 3 Months !,"I bought this on February of 2006. It stop working on May of 2006. For $180.00 its not worth it . Everytime I put in the DVD or the VCR this machine would turn off by itself !At first, the DVD will not work if the video is not in the other side,so we have to put the video in, then switch it to DVD so we can watch the DVD. Now it just simply does not work altogether.For this problem DO NOT BUY its not worth the money."
3,Gets the job done,"As with other Orion products the Shorty Plus 2x 3-Element Barlow is a quality item. As to whether it is worth the extra money for the 3-Element over the regular barlow, save yourself the cash and get the regular 2x Barlow. I would recommend a ""shorty"" barlow for most scopes as longer 2+x barlows can be difficult to focus."
5,It carries flash drives and I suppose other small gadgets. (6-slot),"This would only be necessary if you can fill the slots inside with flash drives (6-slot). The build construction is acceptable for the price. So overall, only get this if you have many flash drives you want to consolidate into this one convenient carrying case."
5,Exactly what I needed to organize my USBs,"It seems like a silly item to even consider, but oh so useful! If you travel a lot, this makes it easy to just grab and go. A simple thing that keeps you organized. I definitely recommend i."
4,Good for carrying SD cards as well as USB,"I use it to carry all my SD Cards, the fit ok, you can even put 2 sd cards on a single space. Bag itself its quite big, could be smaller. Very good overall"
4,Safety for your drive.,I used to carry my important thumb drive loose in my hip sack. That is until I switched hip packs. The drive fell out of one of the pockets and I learned the hard way that I needed a safer method to transport my USB key. This is the perfect solution. It cushions the drive and I love the clip which I use to clip to the zipper of the bag that the other key dropped out of. From now on I only use these for transporting drives. Made of nylon and plastic it holds 2 drives and closes with Velcro. It comes with metal clip. Great for peace of mind.My only gripe is the inside plastic holder should be thicker.
5,Handy carrying case,"The photo of this particular unit is a bit out of proportion, but this is a single usb drive carrying case. These are great to have if you back up photos, music, etc. to flash drives and need to carry them around. You can hook several together with the key clips. These cases are sturdy and travel well."
4,Regular purchase,I ordered this as an afterthought. It is a good item. Normally just a regular purchase and something every one will need.
5,No complaints,Now I have a place to keep all my thumb drives. The case is not flimsy at all has a nice look and feel
5,Perfect,"Just what I was looking for. I have a number of flash drives what I use for various things, and this made it easy to organise them all.."
2,Clip is very weak,"Used this item to hold my Fitbit, a pedometer that is roughly the size of a USB drive. The clip broke (as others have stated) within the first month. I wouldn't recommend this solely because of the clip. The rest of the case is ok. Just ok."
5,It does what its supposed to,"Gave this a five-star because it serves its purpose and does what it is supposed to. It is well sewn together with quality materials, including a strudy plastic clip. It is very portable, which may be an advantage or maybe not. I purchased the Case Logic six flashdrive storage case later because frankly, who uses just two flashdrives? For my purposes, the storage case is used at my desk for storing flashdrives. If you intend to use this storage case for portability, travel, storage in your laptop carrying case, then this would be useful. Just saying you may want to consider more storage capacity when purchasing a flashdrive storage case. Either way, Case Logic products are good and offer many cost effective storage cases. Their CD/DVD and memory card storage cases are also very good. (Don't order the wrong product for your intended use.)"
4,Great case,Middle schools now require kids to have a flash drive. This is a great case to clip to a backpack to lower the chances the flash drive will get lost.
4,As advertised,"It does what it's supposed to do, store usb drives. Works as advertised. Great price for the item and it helped me corral in all those loose usb jump drives."
3,Does the basic job. Amazing how few options there are anyway,For some reason there aren't a lot of USB drive cases. And USB drives get misplaced easily or fall to the bottom of a bag or drawer filled with various items.The price is right. Quality is ok.
5,good buy,"This is a good buy if you need somewhere to put your flash drives, it has 6 spaces. I actually put seven in there and they fit fine, and not all of them are flash drives. Two are memory card converters; they are a little bit bigger, but they still fit fine."
1,WARNING! Total waste of money,"Cheaply made (I wonder where?). The compartments that hold the drives are made of chintzy transparent plastic and come stuffed with advertising. Just pulling that garbage out ripped the plastic from the sides. No sense sending a couple of dollars item back, I threw it away."
1,never receved this product,I never receved this product from suplyer so there can be no review at this time will try in a month or two might have by then.
5,A beautiful little pocket jewel!,"This little drive shuttle is one of those exquisite treasures one runs across upon occasion that is a real jewel. Handy, durable, attractive and functional. What more could one ask for in this tidy little drive holder-carrier.I number my flash drives with a laundry marker so I can keep track of them, more to the point, what's on them, having two of these carriers, plus use a sticky return address label stuck on the inside for identification so they won't get mixed up with someone else's. Also they have a way of finding their way home - just in case. A ""just in case"" is bound to happen no matter how careful one is and this little case is just the one that got to find its way home! A beautiful little gift for a youngster gadding about with friends and family!"
5,case logic 6-capacity case for usb drives,Good for the price. I have several usb drives that fit well and it is small enough to carry. Quality of the case feels good but I have used it only for 2 weeks.
3,Bulky,"I thought I could deal with this in my back pocket for at work. Instead, it holds all the spare flash drives in my desk. Still work the buy."
4,Light Weight and Awesome Way to Store Everything,"This nifty little case from Case Logic is awesome, I love most of Case Logic's products. The case itself is light weight, but quite sturdy and of good construction. The case is made of a polyester fabric just like all of their other products. The shape of the booklet is great too, since it's strong enough to keep it's shape and won't be easily crushed or warped. The pockets are simple polyester mesh for you to insert your USB stick into and the mesh is strong and secure and hold everything snugly. It's a great way to keep track of all these small technology items like thumb drives and whatnot, especially since everything is getting smaller and smaller.My only complaint with this item, which is a much bigger issue in the 2 capacity case, is that there is this annoying tag sewn on the inside of the case. Why do they all have this annoying tag that sticks out and gets in the way of the usb sticks? I simply cut the fabric tag out, but it's a bit annoying."
5,It was just what I expected,It was just what I expected. It was just what we wanted. It was just what we wanted. It was just what we wanted
3,Nice Case but Too Small,I like the case and the concept. The only problem is that the case is too small and the mesh pockets are very tight. I struggle putting mid to large size USB flash drives in the case. They get stuck and if they are too large the case won't close.This is best for slim USB flash drives nothing more. The case is of good quality.
3,Almost good,Has no provision for identifying the individual drive contents and no pocket for a business card or name & address
3,Good for the Price,"The product is good for the price that you pay. The two problems I have with it are as follows:1) The material that holds the USB devices in is plastic. To me that is not the best material. It seems it could break/rip off from the rest of the material very easily. It should have been made from a thin elastic material. I think that would hold up much better.2) The two sides are held together by a small piece of velcro. This leaves the sides open to wear dust/dirt can get in. I would have liked to pay a little more for something that zips maybe. Or at least seals all the way around.Overall, it does its purpose. I hope it holds up."
4,"Keeps up to 6 thumb drives in one place, offers some protection","The Drive Shuttle is the size of a normal wallet, only thicker. Inside, there's room for exactly 6 USB drives, held together securely by means of a partitioned mesh and a rubbery band that keeps them in place, three on each side. The walls seem to be reinforced to a degree that there is no danger for the little drives to break if dropped or crack inside a stuffed computer bag but they are likely to be crushed if stepped on. This holder is not expandable.I find the drive shuttle useful if one needs to keep up to 6 USB drives in one place and one is disciplined enough to return the USB drives to it when not in use. However, I found that I'm using 8 such drives with some regularity so I would welcome a larger holder.Note: I purchased the all-black version myself."
4,Does the job,"This is a no frills thumb drive case. I carry two or three in it back and forth to work every day, have used it for around a month and it's holding up fine. It's fairly well made, a bit flimsy but you get what you pay for. It keeps things protected from dust and keeps them organized. If you're looking for something that's battlefield hardened, look elsewhere."
4,Inexpensive case for thumb drives,"I own a number of products made by Case Logic and have always been impressedwith the quality of workmanship that is usually reasonably priced. The USB drivecase under review doesn't quite come up to those standards. The main drawback isthe size of the mesh pockets that hold the individual drives. If your drives areall on the small side, then there shouldn't be a problem. However, if, like myselfyou own a number of different sized/shaped drives, I found that a number of themdidn't fit inside the little pockets. I also noted the case itself was large enoughto hold 10 or 12 drives but had only 6 pockets.Hopefully, Case Logic will come out with a 2.0 version that's undergone a re-designadressing the issues noted above."
4,Very nice organizer for thumbdrives,This is a handy organizer for thrumb drives. I like the color (blue) as I can seperate by category and know immediately that there are USB's containing personal files.
5,It does the job,"I purchased this case when my flash drive broke at the end where you attach it to a key chain. Not wanting to carry it around in my hand every day, I looked for something that would hold it on my keys securely. This product does the job. It Velcros together well and the hook for the key chain is solid. It has held up to everyday use and abuse so far. The outside neoprene material makes for a good protective cover. Some people have commented on how flimsy the plastic is inside to hold the flash drives and that it does not hold two flash drives well. I can see their point. I am only using it for one flash drive, so it works well for that purpose. The plastic inside has held up so far. I think as long as you don't tug on it too hard, it should hold out without problem. Overall, a good product at a good price."
5,Just what I needed!,"I am so glad I purchased this USB flash carrying case as it is perfect for my needs. I have it filled with 4 GB and 2 GB flash drives and would not hesitate recommending this Caselogic. It fits the description, the price is right, and delivery time was right on!"
3,it doesnt look like it will last long,i ordered this and the Case Logic JDS-6 USB Drive Shuttle 6-Capacity-Black and it is different the 6 capacity has a net holding the usb's but the 2 capacity has plastic. it seems as if the plastic will rip along the seems after repeated use. i prefer to stick with the 6 capacity because of the nets.
1,Cheap case,"The case is very flimsy and the elastic that holds the USBs in feels like it's going to rip after a few uses. This is NOT a hard case like other Case Logic items. The case didn't fit any of my USBs nicely with out me thinking the elastic was going to CRUSH the USB and destroy it. Also, since the case isn't a hard case, and the USBs aren't offset from each other on each side, if you were to bonk the case the USBs would crash together and get destroyed. There is no extra protection this case provides. Of course I returned the product, but somehow it's my fault that the website doesn't give the dimensions of the actual HOLDING part of the case or say that this case doesn't really protect anything, I had to pay shipping to return it.You're better off putting your USBs in a dollar change purse."
1,What a joke and waste of money,"Re: Case Logic USB drive holder. I would be interested in seeing any other review on this item. Since there is absolutely no more than a 1/16"" space between the cover itself and the two attached pieces of plastic, I have no idea what this product can hold other than a thin card or piece of paper no wider then 3/4""Return it?-- Also a joke. It would cost as much as the product to return so why would one bother?But for the record, this is the first disappointing experience with various purchases via Amazon."
2,Virtually Useless with broken clip,"I really liked this product when I first received it, especially for the price. The outside material durable but the case does not seal closed, which could lead to dirt and debris getting onto the usb drives if thrown in your bag. As such, I kept this hooked to the key ring within my Swiss Gear backpack and used it gently. This morning I was upset to find that there is a spot near the opening lever that was weak and broke, rendering the clip useless."
2,Product was OK,There were multiple product pictures under this part. I wanted and thought I was getting the case that held both USB Drives and SD Drives. I was disappointed to find that not only did I get the wrong case but could not find the other multiple drive case shown.
2,Full of wood bits,"I got this from Lowes a couple years ago. It works if you are on a budget. If you get any fungus gnats, you will have a problem. There are a lot of wood bits and shavings in it along with some sand.I got an infestation of fungus gnats recently. The plants I used with this soil were doing fine until I got the infestation of fungus gnats. Because of the wood, there is plenty of opportunity for fungus to grow. I can't get rid of it, so the fungus gnat larvae has plenty to feed from. I'm trying some pesticide/fungicide that comes in granules. Hopefully it will work.I've never seen potting soil with wood and so much sand in it before this. I've seen other types that are amazingly worse than this potting soil. There isn't a lot of sand in it, but there is a decent amount that shows up after watering it over time.Overall, It is ok if you don't mind the wood bits all over the place. If you don't want fungus and soil that doesn't hold much water, stay away from this stuff."
1,Not good at all,"I really don't understand how Hyponex has been in business so long with such a bad product. It's like dusty sand, just awful. The best thing to do, if you can't find another brand, is just buy some good top soil at the lawn and garden store, some vermiculite, some perlite, and make your own blend. By the way, I've also tried the Hyponex Organic mix, which is an under-composted bag of clumps, and has the added bonus of containing fungus gnat larvae... I ended up having to throw away the plants that I potted with it in order to get rid of the infestation. I would avoid all Hyponex products."
1,Terrible,"This ""potting soil"" is more like clay. You open the bag and it looks like a brick. You literally have to break it apart instead of pouring it out of the bag. I had to mix it with other soil just to be able to plant anything in it. I don't think it has any nutrients in it either. My plants seem to grow very slow in this compared to other brands. Do not buy this."
2,"Terrible on its own, useful as a mix-in","Ive used this stuff several times, usually purchased at a discount store. Learned long ago that attempting to grow anything in it on its own was a terrible idea. The soil is almost water repellant, almost fascinating really. But I discovered that it works great as one component of a mix when trying to grow desert plants. Tossing in a few handfuls of this with some coir or peat, bit of perlite, and some compost, makes the soil drain faster and help avoid drowning plants that are more suited to dry arid climates. Only reason I mention this at all is the soil tends to be cheaper than buying gardening sand. You may want to sift out the wood chips though. A bit of shaking and the stuff ends up with an inch deep layer of mulch on the surface."
2,Wasted Potential,"This book had the potential to be very insightful and interesting, however upon reading it I found it very unsatisfying. While the concepts in it are interesting and deserve further attention, I found that there was little evidence for the claims being made. For a book preaching critical thinking about religion, the information was presented in a way that only a scholar of Ancient Egyptian culture would be able to verify. Also, most info was credited to only 1 or 2 sources, which left me wanting more. It seemed like a limited view was being presented. I was expecting a more thorough, in-depth look at this issue, not a glossy introduction."
1,harpur is strange,I am amazed at Tom Harpur.He knows nothing about Christ.I suggest that he should get in contact with some peoplewho are baptised in the Spirit to give the lost soulsome assistance.I never knew that trash was acceptable for publication.I suppose when you have a doctorate you have the rightto say anything.Throw the book in the garbage.
2,Dishonest,"Mr. Harpur clearly doesn't believe in a literal interpretation of the Bible and that's ok because neither do I. But to imply that the stories in the Bible were written as a kind of collection of ""myths"" which nevertheless contain wonderful lessons we can learn from is absurd. Why then all the admonishments in the New Testament like ""this is written so that you shall believe""? You are very, very wrong Mr. Harpur. Most of the Bible was meant to be taken VERY literally. Problem is that a literal reading of the Bible is incompatible with a modern worldview, so Mr. Harpur like other liberal theologians has to envelope himself in a theology which is little more than conjecture and personal opinion."
3,Still waiting for the other half of this book!,"Interesting read, but I was disappointed by the one sidedness of his writing, especially considering that he is an academic. I expected at least a partial acknowledgment of the possibility of the validity of the Christian texts, rather than the dismissal of the Christian writing because it mirrors ancient myths so closely. Yes, Harpur's argument did allege that the similarities between Christianity and ancient Egyptian myths were too similar to be coincidence, but he didn't give any credence to any opposing points of view. The coincidental (or not) similarities to Egyptian myths does not in itself invalidate the possible accuracy of the Christian story.In my opinion, he only wrote half a book. I'd like to read the other half of the book that I paid for and didn't receive!"
5,True Christainity,"After several readings of this book I have discovered the true esscence of the power of Christainity.I no longer feel plagued by a groups desire to promote only false beliefs and doctrines for maintaining conventional comfort, power and a community of passwords. These same people with their unilateral rightous attitude that God is exclusive are only ""Chaining the hands of God"". I have discovered that through the ""Christ In Me"" I can now embrace a pluralistic approach to my relationship to God that supplies me with a personal foundation with respect and interest in the fellowship of one human family."
5,Pagan Christ,"""The Pagan Christ"" is by far the most spiritually uplifting and enlightened book I've read in quite a while. Christ's Spirit dwelling in everyone is wonderful. The was the Bible is interpreted allegorically is the way it should be taught in Churches today."
5,The Pagan Christ by Tom Harpur,"Excellent Book. The only problem is, Christians do NOT want to know the truth. Fraud, forgery and deciet keep this dying institution hanging on by its finger nails. Wake up ""christians""."
3,When they say Small...,"Although the journal is quite lovely and made well, I would suggest that the web site put the measurements of this journal on the description. It is actually smaller than I had expected."
2,size,"I see no one took the advice of the second reviewer and included the measurements in the description! Since I am backpacking, this is very important to me. I would not and will not order it without them."
5,"I liked the extra cd, but not for the price.","The extra songs were nice to have, most of them were the music video versions of two songs on the original cd,l and the other two songs were new. One of them I know of has a music video. Then then end of the cd has ringtones for your cell phones, messages for your answering machines, and massages for your texts. Those were kind of a waste to me. I think the almost 30 dollars was steep for this, so if you have the original, then I'd just go to a music hosting place like Itunes and download the other songs. I think its a great cd pack, but not for the price."
1,Made me retch ...,Turned it off after 2 minutes ...Lame amateur effortThe blurb is far more clever than the movie.2 buns down:(
2,"too dim, disappointing","The lamp just simply does not produce much light. I was expecting similar output to a halogen desk lamp, but the LED lamp is more like a flashlight than anything else. The design is still pretty cool. I do like the goose-neck, and the base is heavy enough that the neck can be twisted around without tipping over.2 stars for design."
4,Interesting Images...,"Very interesting montages/collages of images that are, I'm betting, meant to tap into the psyche. I already had the book but as of yet I haven't had time to spend time with the cards. I would love to interview Mr. Wanless once I've had the opportunity to really delve into working with these cards."
4,Chemical Ecology: the sense God gave an ant,"Chemical Ecology is a relatively new science that blends chemistry, biology and behavioral science in order to understand chemical interactions of things in nature. Agosta provides readers with a broad overview of chemistry in nature in a fascinating format that requires only interest in science to appreciate and only basic knowledge of chemistry and biology to understand. Like Agosta's recent book, Thieves, Decievers and Killers, this book strives to give a broad look at the world of chemical interaction. Unlike it, however, Chemical Communication offers a more technical approach utilizing many interesting diagrams, photos and drawings of chemical structures, while maintaining narrative like readability."
3,A Little Worried,The DVD is sealed in the plastic wrap but we can hear the DVD floating around in there. We are not opening this until Christmas so we hope the product isn't damaged.
4,Great set of down-home bluegrass tunes,"This is a great set of bluegrass from Galax, Virginia banjoist Stevie Barr, of the band No Speed Limit. Mixes secular and gospel material, as well as informal live performances with several utterly amazing studio tracks, particularly the instrumentals where Barr really cuts loose on the banjo... And, man, is he good! Very fast, and very good. Has a nice DIY feel that festival goers and back-porch pickers will appreciate. This is the real deal. (DJ Joe Sixpack)"
1,Fine product but 1 month later still hasn't shipped,Good product but had to buy it from loacal store weeks ago. It's been about to ship for 1 month now as the only reason I haven't canceled the order is I'm curious how long if will take to actually ship to me. With a young family we can always user wipes (assuming they arrive with the next couple of years)
1,can't review item i have not received.,"its been almost two months since i placed this order and i am yet to receive this product. i didnt want to cancel it cause it may affect the discount i received on the other items i received from the order. i dont know if this comment will be read by your customer service team, cause i'd surely like to know when i'll be receiving this item."
5,High-octane Proclaimers,"This album, supported by a U.S. tour, is perhaps the highest-energy Proclaimers offering to date, delivered on the heels of their unexpected attention for the song ""500 Miles"" that appeared in ""Benny and Joon."" The Reid brothers are nothing if not themselves, with strong Scottish accents and concerns about family, religion, work and Scotland, all expressed in song. They tip a cap to their blues roots by covering Otis Redding's ""These Arms of Mine,"" but the true gems are ""Shout, Shout"" and ""Don't Turn Out Like Your Mother."""
2,Christian Rock an Oxymoron,Sunshine on Leith is a fabulous album. Hit the Highway unfortunately demonstrates that although Christianity may be good for the soul it is bad for music. The brilliant lyrics of Sunshine have disappeared and been replaced with dull preaching accompanied by nice guitars.
2,Disappointing,"I chose this one because of it's larger size but the blanket came with a broken handle, even if it hadn't I would have been disappointed. Obviously we didn't use it (returned) but the soft side seemed cheap and thin. Not the cozy picnic blanket I expected."
2,STATIC,"AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!Even though I got my favorite color(green),I was disappointed with the scratchy velcro in the middle of the blanket, as also mentioned by another reviewer. The hood is impractical to use - it's literally putting a bag over your head. And that strap on the outside is short, which is not really convenient. However, it is the biggest waterproof blanket you can probably get for $20. If you don't mind it being thin and if you're ready to do some wrestling-back-into-the-bag, then this might be the blanket for you."
5,Coleman blanket/poncho/pillow,"This product makes a great survival item for winter weather in your auto.It can be used as a blanket, or as a poncho with a warm fleece lining andhood. It stows in a small package and is worth it's weight in protectionin the event you get stranded or stuck out in the cold and rain or snow."
3,50/50,"This is the second time ordering this blanket. This first one I ordered some time ago. It came in green. It was a great color and was on the thin side (a plus for me). This time I got a blue one. I wish amazon would let you choose your color. Also it feels a bit thicker. For my purposes its too thick and uncomfortable. Also because it's thicker its harder to fit in the bag. I kinda want to give it 2.5 starts, the lower average. Old Green one 5 stars, New Blue one 2."
2,not funtional,"Great idea on the screen, not so functional in use. It will never pack up as nice as it is designed to when they send it to you. The material on one side is shiny nylon and hence slippy to sit on (and fold). The other side is an unsubstantial fuzzy surface that feels very synthetic like and not warm and snuggly at all. I'll keep it but regret buying it."
2,Its ok...,Maybe its just me...but I was not impressed. I bought it for a gift to go with the picnic backpack and it looked no more than just average. I thought it was going to look alittle more like LL Bean or LandsEnd quality. I guess you get what you pay for.
1,Great for camping,I got my son-in-law and grandson these for camping....great to sit on and to provide added warmth to their sleeping bags.
4,Great basic picnic blanket,"Do not be swayed by the reviews that say it is difficult to put this blanket back in the bag. It is not difficult at all. You simply fold it in half, roll up/fold each side toward the middle and then roll it up to stuff it into the bag. It takes seconds. I have two children under age 3 to juggle and I still manage to do it in under a minute.I purchased this blanket because it is inexpensive, has a carrying case/bag, and is water resistant (no wet bum). I think the hole that gives you the ability to wear it as a poncho is a little weird, but who knows...I might one day need to take advantage of that feature. The head hole does velcro together, so it's not like you are sitting on a blanket with a gaping hole in the middle of it."
3,"average, maybe","with 27 glowing reviews i ordered this ""blanket"" with confidence. i should have read the few bad reviews a little closer. it is a pain to fold up, provides little warming as the blanket part is super thin, and the poncho mode is giant and unwieldy. its not defective so much as ineffective. i was thinking backpack camping but now im thinking car trunk for emergency ONLY. i definetly disagree with the ""camping"" tags, oh well"
4,Coleman Roadtrip Blanket,"This was a great purchase! I used it for several days on an outdoor camping trip, it rolled up well to fit on the front of my backpack and kept us dry when sitting on the ground. I also used it as a parka during a storm, it was warm and dry.I did have an issue the first time that I washed it, after returning from my trip. I followed the label instructions and the inside pouch came unglued. I returned the item without a problem, but I don't think I would ever put it in the dryer again. Other than that, the price was right and it is a great item that will definitely be going on all of my camping trips."
4,"Good, very handy !!",Had it for over 3+ years. Used it for many picnics and park visits. Easy to pack and clean. Comes in handy as poncho.
4,We use it daily,"We bought this original for our family daycare. We wanted something soft for the kids to crawl on when outside. The inside is so soft. I also use it for softball games either as a blanket for cold games, a seat cushion for benches, or some place for my younger son to have a snack. It was in the back of our truck for a long time and I grabbed it as a pillow for a long car ride. Definitely worth every penny."
2,below average,these i use to tie down a motorcycle; and each time it is a HASSLE and each time i worry of not being able to free them up trying to get them loosened. certainly no product i would buy again ...
3,My son loves it...I can't stand it,"For some reason my son loves to play this game. He is not a big Thomas fan, but likes this anyway. I have a problem with it because he has trouble making the turns on the tracks and always hands the joystick over to me so half of the game is actually played by me. I also have trouble making the sharp turns because it is tricky and I have to back up several times to try it again. It can get frustrating and annoying. I would give it 1 star, but gave it more because although I think it is the worst of the V-Smile games (and we have about 10 of them), my son still loves it."
3,game,"This game is slightly too difficult for a three and a half year old. He understands the bus starting and stopping, but tends to hold the control, push the joystick up and just watch. He'd rather make the train go around the tracks aimlessly than go get letters or avoid obstacles."
3,my son loves it,"Although I think it is somewhat poor in video and audio quality, my son just loves this cartridge and plays with it quite a bit."
4,Both Concise and Complete!,"Stetson and Conti succeed in producing a text that both adequately describes and succinctly encapsulates most important aspects of the history and boundaries of true tolerance. What passes for tolerance today, they argue, is not really tolerance in the classical sense, but a specific sort of ideological viewpoint which actively works to suppress rather than encourage discussion and diversity. It's a well-argued case in a great book, and I recommend it highly."
4,Good,I had read book 2 in the collection first and just had to know what went on so I went back. I am glad I did. Can't wait to read more of this family
3,I was a bit disappointed by this one.,"Call me crazy, but the idea of the hero in women's clothing and makeup was a total turnoff. And the fact that he appeared to enjoy it so much only worsened it for me. Add that to the author describing him as femininely beautiful and I had a nasty picture in my head that I couldn't get rid off.Fort's treatment of Chastity was horrifying. He verbally and physically abuses her and never asks for forgiveness. I know his story is told in ""Something Wicked,"" but I'm not sure I can ever forgive him for slapping Chastity across the face. I don't think he deserves Elf!Chastity's father is a terrible addition to this book. I know he had to be portrayed as cruel, but Cyn should have beaten him to a pulp for it. The Earl verbally and physically abuses Chastity and it really makes for an uncomfortable read.I am going to try to read some of the other books in the series. Hopefully they improve!"
3,Ultimately unrewarding Bach,I disagree with the 5 star ratings given for this disc. Performances are generally rather rushed and all the overtures truncated. Playing is acceptable though I was not inspired by the flautist in Suite 2. The trouble is ultimately this disc is neither particularly exciting nor played with real feeling ( if Baroque music can be !). Perfunctory is one word which comes to mind. Chopping great lumps off the overtures might improve the balance of the suites given most other movements are short but that does not really work either.Of course that is how 4 suites get on one disc. I played Musica Antiqua Koln's versions after and these are clearly better considered and are my personal versions of choice. Vastly superior although on 2 discs.
3,Other slingshot animals hold up better,"This was great fun--for about 5 slings. His feet came off after two, his wing loose after about 4, and he fell apart soon after that. Other slingshot animals I purchased held up MUCH better. The team had a great time sling-shot-ing animals across the room."
4,Fun for any age,Bought these for the kids that will be at our family Christmas party. I'm sure they will be flying all over and the kids and adults will have fun with them!
3,Stocking toys,"I ordered this and 3 other animals as stocking stuffers. I was charged for 4 toys (duck, cow, pig and frog) but never received the frog! Oh well, it wasn't worth the couple of bucks to hunt it down...but I was disappointed. Anyway, we haven't tried them out yet (they're to ""fly"" Christmas eve), but am hoping they work (some of the previous reviews were less than stellar). Wish us luck!"
4,My Favorite,"I bought a bunch of these flying animals for kids xmas gifts and the duck is up with the monkey for the best. It actually sounds like a quack (unlike the pigs sad oink) and flys almost as far as the monkey, but further than the others. This is better for olders kids and adults as the beak gives a larger spot for your finger(s) when launching. We did have 1 break, but it was drowned in a water dish, so the kids were to blame. All the others have held up to much fun. We liked them so much we kept several ourselves."
2,Fun but breaks easily,"After about 5 shots the pockets where you insert your fingers ripped. Definitely not made for durability and doesn't last. I've read comments on other websites where they are broken fairly quickly. I wouldn't pay over $3 for it and don't over-stretch it.*On a positive note, it's best use was for scaring or waking up people who didn't expect it to come flying & quacking by... :)"
2,Completely disappointed,"Bought this with a couple of other similar slingshots (monkey and cow). This duck was the first to break, the very first time my nephew tried to stretch it to fly. The rubber tube inside just snapped and the head went about 2 feet forward and that was it. The other two animals lasted about 30 minutes. Not at all the amount of fun I had anticipated from the other reviews I read."
3,"Fun, but not durable.","This is a fun toy, but younger children would shoot it at each other, and that would hurt. The part where you put your fingers tends to come apart, so be prepared to do some mending on it."
1,Overcharged shipping and false advertising.,"We were overcharged shipping and handling of $21 above actual shipping costs. We expect this amount to be credited to our VISA card. We are not sure how durable this toy will be but it definitely does not fly the way it is shown in the advertising. the ovrcharge of shipping made this item twice as much as was stated. I attempted to send an e mail to the seller and it was returned, the seller no longer has that e mail. Therefore, I am asking that Amazon takes care of the credit if you want a better review."
2,It plays music?!,Took it out of box and everything seemed fine. Made quack noises and slung easily. A week later my boyfriend opened as I bought this as a gift for him and it didn't play the quack noises at all. Then my nephew slung it and it outstretched the neck and broke. Great idea for a toy. Quality of it should be improved a little more.
2,a disappointment,"The songs on this CD are crammed one after the other, with little or no pause in between, which causes a jarring effect when listening to it."
5,Great!,I was happy to find these on Amazon as you can't find them anywhere ... and your p-touch is not functional without a sharp blade.
2,This book offers too many generalizations.,"I puchased this book in conjunction with The Affordable Horse and found this book lacking the detail I needed in regard to many of it's topics. The Affordable Horse did have the information I wanted however.(Thankfully) Many of the pages in Buying Your First Horse refer to common sense items. Example, don't walk behind a horse, you may be kicked. The book refers the reader to different sources for information but doesn't provide detail within it's own pages. I was disappointed."
2,This book is overrated,"This book is overrated. The tips are basically common sense. There are few really helpful bits of advice; the authors seem unwilling to ""go out on a limb"" and make specific recommendations. They would have done much better to provide more details on items such as the pros and cons of each breed or tack/equipment needed. I would not recommend this book except for someone who knows absolutely nothing about horses."
2,Not enough information!,"If you know little to nothing about horses this book will probably have a good deal of information for you. However, for people who know more about horses this book is not really applicable. Too many of the topics the author brings up are not thoroughly covered...mainly you get an overview but no real knowledge is gained. Also this book is not a guide to BUYING your horse, it should be titled ""So...you think you want to buy a horse"". You will want and need more information about the actual purchase...such as confirmation and good questions to ask about the horses current and past health."
2,Lacking Foundational Detail/19th Century Typesetting,"For a book published within the last few years, and given the state of electronic publishing and pre-press software, you'd think the basics of page layout and word wrap could have been deployed to come up with a more presentable product.From a content standpoint, this book fails to get beyond generalizations, which are repeated ad nauseum, to a level of detail from which real world actions and decisions can be launched."
4,Very useful,"I'm currently a 2L and last year, I used a plethora of study aids. I found this book to be the most helpful for Torts class. The book explains the history behind the subjects and then what the substantive law is. It lays everything out very logically and is organized in a way that makes sense as well. While it doesn't have any comprehensive case summaries, if you truly want to understand the law of torts, you can't go wrong with this book."
5,GREAT PRODUCT!,Extremely great product and even better shipping. Book was received within fours days of purchase. Great Seller. Look forward to doing business with again
4,Adverse Possession Primer,"Barely any writing and good condition. It met it's descripton. Overall, I was happy with the product and received it when expected."
2,dust covers,"The dust covers were okay except the one for the monitor is way too big, I have a flat screen monitor and the one that was sent is for a regular size big monitor.They didn't give me anyplace to choose a different size."
1,very disappointed,"this was my first internet orders and I recieved old plastic covers for big computers not flat sheets as it stated. The plastic was old and cracked everywhere it had been folded. All 3 pieces. I called for a return and they said they had to email me a return code. They never did. I called again. So far no code, no credit. This is my second review to you. Doesn't anyone care enought to respond. I quess $13.00 isn't important."
5,Superbly written,This superbly written novel based on the siege of Masada is a novel of relationships. Relationships between friends. Relationships between enemies. Relationships of love. Flavius Silva is highly understandable and likeable. Sheva though two dimensional is understandable in her conflicts.Fine drama. Extremely well written. A joy to read.
2,Not equivalent to Amway filter,"Well....Amazon needs to provide more information because even though it is marketed as Amway compatible it is not the same as Amway's.First the filtering surface area of the filter is about of the real Amway filter. Also, the filter is good for 6 months where the Amway filter is good for a year. Last, there is no documentation or any paper indentifying who makes the filter, how does it compare to Amway's, and who assumes product liability. I was given the name of the company that makes it but there is nothing in the filter that identifies the manufacturer. For all you can tell, it could have been made in someone's garage in China.In all, you pay the price but you get what you pay for: the time, the filter surface area and no company willing to assume product liability.Won't buy it again."
3,O.K. Replacement,This product is O.K. as a replacement but a bit smaller than an actual Amway brand filter.I will probably spend the little more and buy an actual Amway softener next time.The water tastes great though. I'm just not sure it takes out all the impurities Amway claims theirs does.Not terribly dissapointed though. As I said...it's O.K.
3,Common sense will tell you!,"Common sense will tell youThe beep you get is to ""remind"" you to replace the filter - not a true test of the filter efficiency.It is the Max Time length specified before changing, not gallons filtered.Replace the battery and you'll get another year of service, may or may not be efficient.1250 or 1000 gallons is the test and an estimate usage in a year.No Filtration Specs to compare gives me Warning.May give you good tasting water but the reason I bought this filter is to FILTER OUT THE BAD STUFF!doe's it do that ?I guess my only option is to order one to read the specs & compare the ANSI/NSF Standards."
2,IFfy filter,"Should have read the other reviews. I guess it is filtering, but I plan to replace it in about 6 months. Besides being smaller, there was no carbon looking water that usually comes out in the first couple of minutes. No carbon means not the same filtering to me. The water doesn't have the nasty taste that is present without a filter. That's why I guess it's filtering. I sure don't have any confidence in this one. I won't buy another one."
5,Perfect - even though its smaller!,"Folks, size doesn't matter. This filter is a little smaller than the original but that doesn't matter as water must flow through the filter in order to get to your faucet - and in doing so, your water is perfectly filtered. I will buy this brand again and from this company in the future."
2,"You are buying a smaller, cheaper filter here, not original","the company selling it, waterfiltersonline.com also sells the full size on their web page, and is cheaper too. Be aware, these are not original filters, someone made it who knows where.My advice: walk..."
5,water filters,"Great deal, arrived on time and was a good value. These filters normally cost twice this amount if you purchased the Amway version. Thanks"
3,I like the price but.....,I like the price; compared to purchasing the filter directly from Amway it is an exceptional value however what I don't like is that I don't have any claim as to what contaminates it actually filters out of the water supply.
5,AMWAY E85 REPLACMENT WATER FILTER,Using this filter for over 15 yars.VERY EFFECTIVEIf new one manufactured with the same manufacturer and SPEC will be happy.
5,25 year old Amway filter,"This filter has given us excellent drinking, coffee, and cooking water for over 25 years. Amazon has cut the price of a replacement filter (supposed to change every year) in half. Bravo!"
2,Hum Drum,"The lead singer's voice is not as full as Jimmy's voice, they play the songs a little faster than normal. Jimmy's southern drawl just makes the music sound better, when he sings. I have seen the original band in concert with a horn section and the willettes as the backing vocals' and the concert was done right after they did their last record album. For me being a hard core fan of Wet Willie and if you are a hard core fan of Wet Willie.I DO NOT recommend this CD highly.It's not worth it."
1,"OK band,but no Wet Willie(not even close)",This band is like eating corn flakes without milk and sugar.
3,"Decent item, not worth the price.","I bought this for my 3.5 yr old on to bring to pre-school with him as a water bottle. He absolutely loves it! However, I was extremely disappointed in the design of the flip lid. It broke off on the FIRST fall to the floor (within an hour of opening the box). The actual bottle and the drinking spout are great.. just wish the lid wasn't so flimsy. I would try to find a similar bottle that's cheaper. This one doesn't really seem worth the price."
1,"Alas, our whirlwind romance was fated to be brief...","We met in the sporting goods aisle. Instantly attracted to its perky color, appealing design, and exotic origins, I took it home. After a two week honeymoon period, during which the bottle was much loved, used only for cold tap water, and gently washed with mild dishwashing liquid and a Sigg brush, the liner started to peel off inside the neck. Whatever the liner is made of, I doubt it's edible. The end of the relationship was swift and my lack of judgment embarrassing, but I've learned my lesson. In the future, I will read the reviews first instead of letting Swiss good looks blind me to the fact that I'm falling for an expensive piece of trash."
3,Lovely but...,"Beautiful looking but with 2 features that are annoying to me. First is that you can't throw them in the dishwasher. Okay, not a deal breaker there (even though I've had to tell the kids to put nothing but water in theirs). But they do warn you about that, so really no valid complaint on my side.BUT second, the opening isn't big enough for ice cubes. Not even the smaller sized ones that most fridge ice-makers produce. Not to criticize the design geniuses at Sigg, but I would have thought a wider mouth wouldn't have hurt the integrity of the bottle."
1,The liner is peeling!,I'm highly disappointed in the Sigg bottles and would not recommend them. After a few months of use the liner in my bottle is peeling. I also purchased a Sigg bottle for my daughter and both of them are headed for the trash where they belong. What a scam!
1,Concerned about BPA avoid Samurai Spirit from Amazon,If you are concerned about BPA avoid buying the samurai spirt from Amazon.We ordered one in late October 2009 and when it arrived I checked the color of the lineragainst the known bpa liners at the sigg website and this bottle had the bad liner.Sigg has a trade in program until OCT 31 and I will be trading in my unused bottle.Quite annoying to have to go through this at this point.
1,Liner,"SIGG recently admitted that BPA is in their old liner, but not the ""new"" one. Really? BPA has been in there for years, but you never mentioned it until now? And, we are supposed to trust you on the new liner? Stay away from SIGG if you want a bottle without BPA."
5,Great Water Bottle,"I've been using this for about a week now and love it. It's a water bottle and yes the paint scuffs, you can get a ding and if you aren't careful you can leave it on a park bench and never see it again. Besides those ""faults"" this is a great bottle. No odd taste to the water, almost indestructible and no leaks! This isn't an insulated bottle and won't wash well in the dishwasher so be careful with hot liquids and don't leave it under the seat in the car for a month half filled with Kool-Aid. For the serious water bottle user it doesn't get better than Sigg!"
3,Had metallic taste to it,"I bought two of these Sigg bottles for my husband and me two years ago, when I was trying to get us some BPA-free bottles. Even though these are not supposed to have a metallic taste, we found that they did, and, after using these for a few months, I bought us Nalgene bottles instead, which we've been much happier with."
4,Good bottle. Avoid the sport-top if possible.,"This is a nice bottle - no plastic taste, and the water tastes fresh even if stored in the bottle for a while.The Sigg Sport Top is awful. It's a bit counter intuitive, where pushing it against your lips will open the valve to let water out while you drink. The downside of the design is that if you throw this in a bag or backpack, the bottle will jostle around and eventually push up against something in your bag and leak water. This happened to my wife twice.We replaced the Sport Top with a regular screw-top, and have enjoyed leak-free drinking water ever since."
2,Fragile dust cover.,"I have a 20oz Sigg bottle with an Active Bottle Top. The dust cover, which is the dome-shaped plastic piece that pivots to allow you to drink, is incredibly fragile. I have broken two of these in the last month. I use the bottle while swimming and all I did, was to knock over the bottle on the pool deck while reaching for it. I didn't even drop it. To top it all off (no pun intended), the dust cover shattered into razor-sharp shrapnels, which cut my finger while I was cleaning up. Just imagine these shards on the pool deck with all these people walking about barefoot.The choice of plastic for the dust cover is a very poor engineering decision, given that the bottles are marketed to ""Active"" individuals.In general, the bottles are sturdy, albeit susceptible to dings, scratches and other exterior damage. Get a neoprene pouch if you must have a pristine exterior."
3,Kinda leaky,"I bought this water bottle after going through several $5 sport-top water bottles that leak all over me when I take a drink. I thought the Sigg would be different - but it's not. Better, yes. Leak-free, no.But it is pretty. And I like that it's recyclable and not made of plastic. I would probably recommend a Sigg without the sport-top (I'm considering buying a regular top for mine).Update: It turns out I was using the sport top wrong! It's designed so you have to push down on the top to get the water to come out. I had turned the top past its intended position (a place where you don't need to push down to get the water to come out) and that's why it was leaking. Oops. But problem solved - great water bottle."
3,texasmama,"I jumped on the ""no plastics"" bandwagon a few months ago. I bought my two girls Siggs bottles for lunch, park, etc... The bottles are what you would expect. However, my youngest (1 year) chewed the heck out of the PLASTIC mouth piece. Had to replace that. Secondly, they are a PAIN in the butt to clean. If you are like me...occasionally the bottle gets left in the car overnight. They grow mold very quickly and have hard to reach part to clean. I soaked them, boiled them, scrubbed them and finally scraped them clean with a long wood chopstick. So... good product, but buy the cleaner brush (havent tried it) or get ready for some major cleaning sessions."
5,Sport top vs. loop top,"Having used both tops, I think the sport top is the way to go. Why? It's more flexible. Use your thumb to press down on the release to allow sucking the drink from the bottle. That allows one-handed drinking from, say, a bike. Or, if you need to guzzle a lot of water, uncrew the sport top as you would with the loop top. With the sport top, it's easier to screw and unscrew because there's more for your hand to work with, IMO. Hope that helps."
4,A great read,"Everytime I put this put down, I'd be compelled to pick it up again and continue reading. I found the main character extremely believable, and I was kept in suspense till the very end. Looking forward to the next one!"
4,a good representation of an excellent exhibit,"This book is based on an 1996 exhibit in the New York Public Library which featured original material from one hundred poets, covering centuries of work, including poets as diverse as John Donne and Allen Ginsberg. Part of the appeal of the exhibit was seeing the actual original manuscripts, jotted notes, and correspondence right in front of you, and in that regard, the book can not live up. It is, nonetheless, excellent in its scope and interesting in its reproductions of the material from the exhibit. It would be particularly appealing to students or enthusiasts of poetry, that is, those with a prior background knowledge of the poets included. It would be of less value to someone looking for an introduction to poetry. I did thoroughly enjoy both the exhibit and the book and do strongly recommend it to any poetry enthusiast."
4,Excellent US view on Indian security issues,"Stephen Cohen's book, even though it deserves an update, ten years after its initial publication, is still an excellent overview on India's security, covering all relevant foreign policy and military aspects and drawing on the author's immense knowledge of the relevant literature and his decades long exposure to the country. This focus - and the resulting neglect of economic, social and developmental aspects - make the title a bit more encompassing than warranted. I would therefore suggest to complement it with books on these other aspects to get a full picture of India's rise and the challenges on the way."
5,One of the best Review about South Asia,Its one of the best book in the market about South AsiaAnd i agree with the author that India is going to be a Power in South AsiaAs USA and the free World have one thing common with India and that is Democracy and to work hard and live in a civilized world

5,Surround Air Multi-Tech XJ-3000D Air Purifier,Great air purifier....can't beat the price either!! Highly recommend...very happy :) Easy Easy to use. I paid $500 for another model and returned it! This model at $140 blows the $500 model away.Surround Air Multi-Tech XJ-3000D Air Purifier
1,Not effective - but could be my situation,"I live in a basement without any circulation. The main air conditioning/heating does not get to my room. I have a pet rabbit who it turns out I am mildly allergic to. I wake up congested sometimes. The air filter did not fix the problem. The only thing that fixed the problem is me leaving my door open during the day to get some circulation. My room is just an average bedroom. And yes, I did unwrap the filter before putting it in."
4,Good for the Money,This is a good air purifier. I have not recieved any complaints from my family who I bought it for. I rated this based on my personal reviews before I actually bought it.
3,Not Really Sure,"I've waited 6 weeks or so to write this review to give this item a chance to work. First I used in it my bedroom, which just about matches the dimensions it is supposed to be able to clean. I noticed some difference in the amount of dust that settled next to it but not overall in my room. Nor did I feel it changed my allergy symptoms much when I woke up.Then I tried it in my living room, within about 8 feet of where I sit when I am awake, on the high setting. There it did help. I have definitely felt a change in my allergies (symptoms pretty much gone)when I do that. If I can find a convenient place to put it permently near me in the living room I might do that. It is pretty compact, but on high it is a little noisy for the living room - yes, it is white noise, kind of like a refrigerator humming or the faucet on -- but it is definitely loud enough on high to use it only when you are alone. I haven't tried the lower settings yet to see if it works that well that close to me."
5,Something wicked this way comes,"Anyone with a twisted sense of humor should find some time to meet Lenore (the cute little dead girl) and her evil friends. And what a lovely bunch they are:Ragamaffin (aka some little weenie guy) - a vampire trapped in a puppet;Mr. Gosh - deeply in love with Lenore and deeply hated by her;Taxidermy - a strange creature from the woods out back, possibly a murderer wearing a dear's head as a mask;Muffin Monster - heck, I've no idea who's this guy. But he has muffins.Kitty #188 (or is it 583? - never mind, it's dead anyway).There's no doubt that mr. Dirge is a genius. In his own dark way. So, without further ado - Lenore, the cute little dead girl. Read it and R.I.P."
4,Extremely enjoyable.,"Roman Dirge, Lenore: Wedgies (Slave Labor Graphics, 2000)I'm jumping on the Lenore bandwagon unconscionably late, I know, but at least I got there eventually. Worse yet, I know I should have waited for Noogies, the first collection, but while leafing through everything I got from the library Friday, I got caught by Ogre's introduction, and from there I was lost. I gulped the whole thing down in one shot. It's sick, it's twisted, it's funny, it's deeply-felt.. Oh, and it's got Jhonen Vasquez, Master of Bees. What more could you possibly ask for? ****"
4,Ammonia is not a subsitute for water,"ooooooOOOoooh. I liked Wedgies.The art was much better than Dirge's earlier lenore. i got to say...MY GOD! *laughs and rolls on the ground* If you like humor other people would define ""sick"" you'll love Lenore Wedges. Trust me, even though you have no reason too do so."
5,Evil genius at work,"Imagine a twisted, sicker Tim Burton (The Melancholy Death of Oyster Boy)... but this risks to be a mere introduction to Lenore's mind-boggling universe of hip, funny darkness. Roman Dirge is a true original. And he's heavily tattoed to boot (a definite plus)."
3,Incredibly overrated...,"Perhaps I missed the point with Lenore, but really, it seems completely and utterly overrated and I cannot understand why it is considered such a cult comic.While the art work is humourous and well drawn, Dirge completely ignores the necessity of plot. There is barely any story to be had, and when Dirge does write, his stories are rushed and uninteresting. While some the poems are compelling enough and actually quite innovative and the few stories about himself are quite good, the rest of the work based on Lenore was a complete anti-climax.Purely for the art, and some of the small poems. To be honest, 'Johnny' and 'Bear' look like much more comprehensive versions of the same thing."
5,Lenore - the cutest little dead girl ever,"This is a collection of Roman Dirge's Lenore comic 5-8. If you enjoyed volume1: noogies, then you are sure to enjoy this. To those who haven't read the first volume, I recommend it if you enjoy dark humor. This is one of the funniest comics i've ever read."
5,Whimsical Style,Edward Ardizzone has the most lovely and whimsical style of illustrating which add so much to his books.Sarah and Simon's father is a poor painter who can't seem to sell his masterpieces. Their mother stays home with the crying baby and valiantly puts food on the table despite the lack of money.Saran and Simon's father lack just one thing to finish the masterpiece that will make them rich- red paint.It ends happily-ever-after which is what a children's book is all about.
5,Seattle Rocks almost as much as this CD,"Its all bout Skill, Skill, Skill this group has it, i love this cd, if your into hip hop/rap than this cd is for you, check it out. This group mixes it up, and makes it look good. If this group gets a little bit more ""known"" then they will definetly make it big. You gotta buy it, dats all i got to say"
3,A disappointment,"This book, in two words, was a big disappointment. While the author's treatment of ethnic groups in Chicago during the 20s and 30s I believe to be fair and surprisingly impartial, the writing is horrible. Many of the sentences throughout the book have too many commas and are too too long. This makes it hard to read any book, and forces the reader to go back and re-read each word syllable by syllable just to get the meaning of each sentence. My history professor assigned this book for one of my classes, and he couldn't have made a poorer choice. I suggest that if you want to get a headache, read this book."
5,Perfect Pictures!,"I have this camera since a few years now. The only problem is that you need to use regular batteries for it. Besides that it's perfect. I've made super crisp pictures, been able to take some of my aquarium fish, with amazing results. The pictures look like in a magazine! Really great.Plus this camera has enough funtions for everyone and is very easy to handle. There are no miniature buttons, wher you could press two instead of the one targeted for, the screen is big enough to really see instantly if your picture is good or not and you can even record videos with it depending on the size of your SD card.Can be connected to a cumputer via USB port and has not only a digital but also optical zoom. All together 12x zoom."
3,Sandy pictures,"PROS:1. Compact. small form factor.2. SD not CF3. 3X Optical4. Very inexpensive. I bought from Costco for $190 (but returned within 3 days because of the cons).CONS:1. All indoor pictures taken with flash came out sandy when enlarge to 200%. You can see freckles on the skin even though the person has no freckles!!!!2. Failed to auto focus when using the digital zoom indoors. However hard I tried to get to autofocus while in digital zoom, I couldn't. Once I brought it back to optical, it focused clearly.There are other pros and cons but they're minor. Some related to the user interface, some to batteries."
1,unreliable camera,"Initially I was very satisfied with this camera. It made fine pictures. And that was all I wanted. But after a few month the battery compartment cover, would not stay closed anymore. I had to wind tape around the battery cover to keep it closed. That worked for about one month. Than that would not help anymore either. Now I can make only three pictures before I have to open the camera to recharge the batteries. I am very much frustrated and will throw the camera onto the dump heap!Even one star is high as a rating for this piece of junk.A. Helmut Fickenwirth"
2,Not up to expectations.,"a a former professional musician, I did not care for some of the solos performed. Sounded like they were self taught"
5,From the perspective of this hobbit. . .,". . .most hobbits would enjoy these two stories.""Farmer Giles"" deals with the sort of ""big people"" we hobbits are familiar with in Bree, namely somewhat slow-witted and loud (and fond of lots of food and good beer). I think that Farmer Giles must be related to my good friend Barliaman Butterbur. Any one of the big people that can successfully tame a dragon is welcome for tea at my hole anytime.""Smith of Wooten Major"" tells the sort of story that would bother some of the more stay-at-home Bolgers and Bracegirdles. But for Tooks and modern Bagginses, the story is great. It is the tale of one of the Big People who, by virtue of a very special gift, is permitted to enter and explore the realm of Farie. I also appreciated the fact that the story is centered around feasting -- a truly hobbitish activity."
4,"Unique, but definetly not The Hobbit","Smith of Wooten Major is a very simple, yet unique book. For those of you who are really into Tolkien, this book is very much his flavor. Perhaps I should point out, though, that this book is NOT the Hobbit and should not be compared to it. If you like Tolkien's style of writing, though, you will like this book. It may not be the deep, sophisticated book the Lord of the Rings is, but it is still a book good enough to be labeled a TOLKIEN CLASSIC.Review by: Dacia Talbo"
2,"Love Tolkien, Really Disliked These Tales","I am an avid Tolkien fan, and I purchased this book as part of my exploration of his other works (other than his Middle Earth tales).I found to my own surprise and regret this book to be really dull and not very memorable. The style that he brings to LoTR is not present here, and it was very reminiscent (to me) of George McDonald, who is one of the authors that Tolkien grew up reading and enjoying.If you like George, I think this book will appeal to you. For myself, I do not care for George's style, and found myself wanting the book to be over as soon as possible."
3,"Well, it is Tolkien","Two short stories, a good and quick read. Did not enchant or endear itself to me as, for instance, the shorts from ""Silmarillion"". The Baynes illustrations are borderline -- not very good."
3,confusing,"This book was confusing because first it was about a master cook. after i read it, it began to make sence. my faivorit part of the book was when he got a farry star inside of a cake. After the he got it he went for a jurny. The guys name was Smith. On his jurny he came upon dancing fairies. While walking home he met an old guy whom name i don't know. Gut was the master cook.They both walked home together."
1,buttons slowly failing...,"we purchased this phone for its looks: cool, stylish, rugged. however, over time, its buttons have started to fail (like many of the other reviews). the first button to ""go"" was the ""phonebook"" function. yes, it was annoying to have to remember phone numbers for friends and family, but this was not the fatal flaw.now, the it is difficult to answer the phone and to end the conversation with the ""on"" and ""off"" buttons. this became very frustrating in many ways. imagine speaking to somebody on speaker-phone and end the conversation, but the person is still on the line!!!prior the the motorola, i had a panasonic cordless phone which lasted years. this is the first and last time i purchase a motorola."
2,Everything nice except most important feature,"This would have been a nice phone set, but the reception was awful! I got static sound no matter where I was in relation to the base and no matter where I put the base in the house.The manual said to place it away from electrical objects such as microwaves and tv's. First of all, it is hard to do that nowadays. Second, I did try to move the base and little units around, but I got no change in reception quality.Otherwise, this would have been a really great phone."
1,low recharge %,"Unable t recharge past 46%, all of the recommendations for increasing the batteries recharge capacity as suggested bySuperb Choice failed."
1,vaya con dios,"I'm sure this CD would be quite good if you could play it. I received two, and they were BOTH totally unplayable with almost every song skipping and totally stopping. I think Amazon got taken by whatever schlock outfit recorded this thing. Not wanting to go through the hassle of sending it back still a third time, I just sucked it up and lost the ""dinero"". So be prepared if you order this, or better yet, order something other than this dud.I wanted to rate this NO stars, but that didn't register. THAT is however my rating."
4,Okay but not our favorite,Barney and friends is better then some others but not as much fun as Winnie the Pooh.
2,not that fun though,"I read the reviews and they seemed good ,but to my disappointment the games were rather boring to my 3yo.I would recommend the Winne the Pooh version, it's certainly much more fun to play"
5,Inspirational and heart wrenching,"I was the Managing Editor of this book and it had me in tears as I worked on it. The stories are so compelling and the writing so superb that it just draws you in. The people and their families are YOUR family and friends and neighbors--I felt like I knew them. I usually try not to get too emotionally involved with the books I work on, but it was impossible not to with THREE ON THE EDGE."
5,Required reading at Christmas for my 3 & 5 yr old boys,"Such a wonderful book for children! It tells the story of Jesus' birth simply, from the perspective of a donkey in the stable. It touchingly reveals the joy of the season through the gifts the animals give to the child and the friendship that develops between the donkey and ox. My boys and I love it!"
4,Cool product!!,I hesitated to buy this product because there were no reviews on it but I must say that it is actually quite good. I use the leave-in moisturiser but I wanted sthg for my scalp. This works fine and it keeps my scalp moist and nice and I use the moisturiser on my locks..good buy and good price..
1,Not so natural,This is mostly petroleum jelly and mineral oil. Not what i was expecting from something called Rasta Cactus Gro. Going in the Goodwill Bin!
3,School Supply Shopping? A decent buy for SailorMoon fans.,"Even though I'm a college junior, I'm not afraid to sport Sailor Moon school supplies. In fact, I was excited to get this set of pencils.Two things you should be aware of:-First of all, the pencils don't have erasers. Most pencils you can buy in stores these days tend to. Not a big deal, but something not advertized.-Second, the images on the pencils aren't in 'full color'. The 'background' of the pencils are red and white striped. Each pencil has images of the inner senshi... Sailor Moon, Jupiter, and Mercury are all yellow, while Sailor Venus and Mars are all reddish-pink.However, when any hardcore SailorMoon fan considers the fact that you're paying less than fifty cents per pencil, it's really not that big of a deal."
2,Much Better Choices Available,"Tilson Thomas--a wonderful conductor of much 20th-century music--just doesn't have the ear for Ives. This seems true for all of the composer's work, as varied as it was. The 1st Symphony, a student composition, in Tilson Thomas's hands seems exactly the proficient but minor piece it was long regarded as. Mehta's rendering on Decca is infinitely more compelling, revealing it as one of the first outstanding American symphonies. Likewise, Tilson Thomas's rendering of the still astonishingly radical 4th does not come close to Stokowski's premiere recording on Sony (I hardly know what to think of the reviewer who finds problems with that recording's audio quality--it's powerful and absolutely first-rate) or Ozawa's thrilling version on DG. That last is paired (along with Ozawa's definitive take on ""Central Park in the Dark"") with a Tilson Thomas ""Three Places in New England""--once again, unconvincing."
2,overpriced,"The attraction offered by the book is that within its covers, you can find a mass of detail about various IT companies. With various projections made by the author's company. Yet you may want to be cautious. A lot of the data about companies can now be easily obtained on the web for free. The basic financials and specialisations and product lines should be accessible this way.Now, for a small IT firm, getting enough information on it via the web can be problematic. But this book won't give it to you anyway. It only covers the top 500 IT firms worldwide, with an emphasis on US firms.Perhaps only if you have found in the past that the trends projected by Plunkett were accurate and useful for your needs, should you contemplate getting this book."
1,"No support, not reliable","The touch screen is not reliable: after 1/2 year of use, I can not enter any address any more, which makes the device useless. The only way to communicate with the company is through e-mail on their web site. I left a complaint about the problem - they simply do not answer. There is no other way to reach the company, to get the device rapaired or replaced.Even when it ""worked"", I never could rely on it. The device does not know the differences between highway and downtown street, and always sends me to a very long way. Sometimes, the route it suggests has loops in it. Many addresses are wrong: I would enter an address for the destination, but the route ends in wrong place."
1,Bad deal,I have a TOM TOM GO 300 Wanted another tried the GO 700 wrong thang to do did not work out of the box. Would not keep even the home adress. Also take me to the mid WEST different time zone. Carry me 2 to 5 streets over from where I was suppose to have been.
4,a helpful traveling tool,"This is a nice portable GPS device, but there are flaws. Understanding its limitations can make expectations tolerable.Pros: Customizable voices(everyone loves this), bluetooth capability to receive and make phone calls, nice color display, adequate voice prompts, points of interest in system surprisingly helpful.Cons: No option to limit route to paved roads only(ask Kim family how important this one is, as the same thing almost happened to me and my family), No ability to save current location as favorite(unless address is recognized), bluetooth compatibility is very limited, some bugs in system cause crashes if address is to rte road, no ability to plan route on desktop then transfer to portable, no ability to manipulate or customize favorites on desktop and transfer to portable.Newer systems may merit your attention if these flaws are addressed, but this is not a bad device at a good price."
1,A Lousy Product and No Customer Service,"I purchased this product on the recommendation of Amazon.com and have regretted it ever since. It's the worst consumer electronic item I have ever purchased. No wonder the price has dropped 50% since my purchase. They probably can't give them away. After about 90 days, the product goes completely dead. After contacting customer service, I was told to reset the product. Two weeks later it went dead again. The last time I went to the manufacturer's website, I couldn't even find any contact information for customer service. They must have so many complaints that they can't handle them. Not to mention product returns. Save yourself some money and a lot of grief. Buy a Garmin system. The graphics aren't as good. But at least it's reliable."
1,terrible GPS and sub-par customer service,"I purchased a TomTom Go and have had problems with the touch screen ever since. It malfunctioned within 6 months of purchase and I had to send it in to be repaired, they said they were unable to repair it and sent me a brand new one. The new one began malfunctioning in exactly the same way within another 6 months. After the subsequent 6 months, I sent it back again for the same problem and they told me it was out of warranty and they no longer repair the TomTom Go but they would send me a newer model for an additional $300-400. Ridiculous, I have been trying to get some sort of satisfaction to no avail. I paid nearly $1000 for this unit when it came on the market and it never worked more than 6 months at a time. It would be best if this company went out of business in my opinion especially after reading the other reviews listed here. I am now having to ""trash"" my unit and buy a different, more reliable, brand."
2,Needs help,"My husband bought me this for Christmas because we were moving to a new city. He picked it out because unlike Garmin and Magellen it was created from the ground up for use on the road. The features are easy to use, the directions are great and when you need a new route because of roadblock or traffic - it really comes up with a great plan. However - my first one lasted 3 months before it died, I then replaced it with another one and it died 3 months later as well. I was very reluctant to buy a different brand - but had to for dependability. I still don't like my Garmin as much - but at least it works. Come on Tomtom - get the electronics working as well as the maps and directions."
2,TomTom Go 700,The 700 works well when its working! I have had to reset it twice. The GPS signal is lost often and can take as long as 20 minutes to come back on line.
2,It's bad to charge for map update,"I bought this product and surprised to find it's preloaded with a very old map. The tomtom website provide free update only for 910/510/One. I can not understand why this model is excluded from the free list. To buy a new map, you need to pay more than $100. It's terrible. It's wise to choose another product which provide free map update."
4,TomTom review,We really like it. It is a very helpful instrument. Enjoy using it as we get lost alot.
2,Think twice,I received this as a gift in January. It comes in handy because I get lost ALL the time. THe first one crashed and they sent me a new one. This one is now acting up. I'm not sure if this is the most reliable on the maket
1,Not ALL bluetooth compatible,"I found, much to my disappointment, that this unit does not support all bluetooth systems. It is compatible with my phone but not my cell phone service provider. This info should be warned to the buyer before a purchase is made."
3,"Same old, same old.","I only got this version because my wife had one that failed and she hates to re-learn another unit. She seems happy with it, so I guess it's okay."
4,Tom Tom GO 700 Portable Navigation System review,"This product has proven to be just what the advertisment say it is. I have used it so far to travel from Maine to Boston, Maine to Atlanta, GA, Maine to Maxwell AFB, AL and all over Maine. I have been very impressed at how easy it is to set up and use. Everything you said would, came with the unit.I will be buying another one in the near future as my wife needs it to keep from getting lost on long trips. Thank you."
1,Lousy piece,"This is junk. The unit is pretty neat, very sturdy and the interface is user friendly. But the software is lousy. It just cant figure out the jughandles in NJ (which my new Garmin does). I get totally lost with this all the time."
2,TomTom 700 Great unit if you aren't going anywhere!!,"The unit itself is great, 3d mapping, spoken turns, easy operation. The problem is the routing engine!! On simple trips it makes them complicated sometimes adding upto 10 miles to a 7 mile trip. A trip to my work which is a straight shot with only 2 turns and 7.2 miles it planned a trip with over 15 turns and 11 miles out of the way. It also took me to the middle of nowhere on 2 different trips using their database of POIs. It had every store in the Oakbrook Mall as 5 miles south of their actual location. If I didn't know the area I'd of been in real trouble. Great looking, poor operation. I returned it, and got the Garmin Streetpilot 2730."
1,it is a lethal weapon,"I am in Michigan and I used this instrument to guide to Rock Financial Center in Novi near Detroit. This is a very famous place in Detroit area. This instrument just guided me to get off the I-96 at exit 160 and ""make a sharp right turn and another right turn"". Actually there is no way to do this except to off road. The whole area was well established more than 20 years. I do not know what kind of map system TOMTOM uses. I have to call this instrument a lethal weapon because it has asked me to do off road for many time. Maybe it is designed specifically for SUV.By the way, its customer services is unacceptably mean."
1,Never got me where I wanted to go ...,"I had this unit for two months and ended up selling it on ebay. I tried it in three different states (MO, WI, TN) and it failed to get me to the correct address every time. Oh, it would get me in the general area OK, but the last turn or two were never right, usually sending me in the wrong direction and requiring me to get my bearings the old fashioned way (call, ask, or follow street numbers). I've been in cars with Garmin units that work flawlessly, but I thought I would try this brand based on a pretty neat design. I guess looks aren't everything."
1,Tom Tom Go No No!,"Unquestionably one of the worst purchases I have ever made! I travel the country as a Sales Mgr. and have utilized mapquest as my guide. Recently purchased a Tom Tom 700 after all of the glowing reviews. On my most recent trip to Cleveland, Minneapolis and Chicago I found it to be the most inaccurate tool I have ever come across. It is missing addresses, it offers incorrect directions and it is not user friendly.To be quite simple about it, don't buy one!"
3,Bad Support Improving (?),"The product works better than the Magellan product I tried last summer. However, the mounting bracket broke and it has taken over two months to get a commitment for TomTom to replace it. Until recently they did not have a published US support phone number. Now they do (it is 866.486.6866).It is very good in open areas, but in a city with many tall buildings (like New York), it (and every other GPS I have tried) gets very confused.When restarted in a new location (i.e. when you take a plane trip and turn in back on in your rental car) it can take several minutes to figure out where it is.All in all, it provides clear voice instructions and is great when you are someplace with a lot of freeways (like LA).More frequent updates would be appreciated, as would Macintosh support.The bluetooth stuff is not ready for prime time."
1,Do NOT Puchase!!!,"What a waste of time and money!! The TomTom customer support is horrible. They loaded European and Canary Islands maps on a GPS unit that was supposed to have maps of the US and Canada. Then, TomTom support said I would have to purchase the maps for an additional $90!Not worth it!! Look at the Garmin Nuvi instead."
3,Latest version???,"I received a refund after ordering/receiving/returning two TomTom GO 700 as neither was the latest version. It would have cost me additional money to download updates on my new purchase.The company demonstrated prompt, efficient and courteous customer service."
3,"Everything is nice, but not for me","This was my first GPS and was not good experience.Like this guy tell exit number on highway, etcMaybe good for some states, but not for somebody living in California."
4,I love my Tom Tom 700!!,"I received my TT700 as a birthday/christmas present 12/05. I am driving to several different addresses each day for work and I love it! I can't believe how much time it has saved in finding my way around, and I thought I knew the streets in my city really well. I continue to be surprised with the new routes I learn when using it, and am getting around much more efficiently. It has been 1000 times better than mapquest for getting around, and when going from one unfamiliar destination to the next, it saves figuring out the route. I also like the POI feature--I always know where the nearest Starbucks is! :)"
1,Very disappointed,"I was hoping for a book to share with Christian friends wanting to know about the feasts of the Old Testament. I found the book to be poorly crafted as the font size and boldness varied from page to page and sometimes changed font type altogether.Also, I found that the way in which the author wrote seemed too simple for the intelligent and educated people with whom I wanted to share this information. The proofs were not proven well enough nor backed with other resources.Simply, I was very disappointed."
4,KeyTronic USB Black Keyboard,"For the money, i can't complain. It works, it does what a keyboard should do."
2,"Good idea, poorly executed","This book should have been a useful and interesting resource, but its function is seriously undermined by the hideous visual design. Instead of presenting the designers' stationery on a neutral background so that it can be clearly seen and appreciated, the book's designer(s) fill the space around and behind the examples with bright colors and shapes, blown up logos, and other distracting clutter. No shadows, borders, or other delineating marks are used to distinguish the stationery from the background, making it difficult at times to even pick out what parts of the page are examples and what are just background ""flourishes.""I recommend that instead of this book, people interested in designers' stationery and other self-promotional work look to design magazines like Step, Print, and Communication Arts for their annual reviews of the best in this and other design areas."
3,Masterly Dupre and Widor - mannered Franck,"I recommend this recording very highly. The sound of the organ and playing is magnificent especially in the Dupre and Widor selections. The Franck ""Grand Piece Symphonique"" however, is another story. After all the scholarship and attention to original playing editions in the past 30+ years, it amazes me that Murray still hangs on to the mannered, in my opinion, highly unmusical, Lemmens' 'legato' style in his interpretation of the Franck work. Buy this for the Dupre and Widor selections, they are amazing!"
3,Any reviewers here not connected to the Hare Krishna movement?,Just curious: are all these reviews an answer to a call put out by the International Society for Krishna Consciousness in order to get this book selling better than others would?Nice alternative to this book: The Bhagavad Gita as translated by Gandhi.
5,My favorite translation!,"This translation of the Bhagavid Gita is my favorite, as Swami Satchidananda's explanations and examples spoke directly to me. I understood all of what he said, and found that I could relate everything he said to something I'd experienced myself. If you really want to understand what the Gita is all about, then this is the translation you need!"
4,FIGHTING FOR ATTENTION IN A DEFICIT SOCIETY....,"Attention is key to communication in any society....listening, seeing and experiencing-- so important to getting any message across, let alone establishing social networks and personal relationships. Rifkin is a master at spotting what is a major issue in our society-- I can't wait to read his European book...He understands trends before they hit the ""Tipping Point"" -- a salute to him. This book belongs on every marketer's shelf and on every student of branding and next-gen advertising and mass communications.....wonder why no one's paying attention -- Rifkin covers some of the possible answers here."
4,Good and Valuable Book,I liked the book very interesting description of the times we are living in. Helps understand the economic tendencies that are actually occurring around us. I enjoy reading it!
2,Re-thinking Ri-fkin,"I've bought this book 'cause I heard a lot of good opinions, considerations about J.Rifkin but never read one of his books. So....I'm sorry but it was been a sort of delusion! Nothing new, just simple considerations about everyday life...everybody can get the same ideas and stimulations reading newspapers...in short a try to describe the new anthropological scenario,but since last years I've personally understood (also in my job) that things are going in the way he explains...so, for me it was not necessary to take 400 pages to say obvious things! Celebrity it's not enough to get 5 stars!"
2,not that good,"maybe it's just that i read it in 2007 (as the date stamp of this review shows) but i already knew all of what was covered in the book. it is old news. maybe it was relevant at the time, but half the things he talked about weren't accurate. *shrug* i found myself skipping through the book; trying to find something worth reading."
1,For the very rich only,"This book is fabulous for the disabled multi-millionaire who can afford to build a very expensive user-friendly house. Unfortunately, it is useless for those of us with more modest incomes who want to modify our homes to put off moving to assisted living facilities. Time magazine gave a totally misleading brief review of this book. For us, AARP is a much better source of information, much of it free...."
1,Is it worth your money? Depends on what you are looking for!,"This book is beautifully laid out, the photography is well done and it would make a coffee table sparkle. But its usefulness is limited to new house construction, to people who like open floor plans, and for those who have the money to spend. I believe it will be of little help to anyone who is working with an older home and is remodeling rather than gutting it and starting over. Also I disagree with some of the layouts in kitchens, etc. as to how easy they are to access with a wheelchair or with a person whose disability prevents them from bending forward or side to side. There is inefficiency to have a person open two doors and then extend drawers. You can design drawers with a lower side to view contents. There were two photos that helped me to visualize concepts I had read about elsewhere. Is it worth your money? Depends on what you are looking for!"
1,horrible,Not anything like the original cartoon. If you've seen the Disney Mickey Mouse show and how it's all bad computer animation then you've seen this movie. The jokes are especially horrendous and both my 7 yr old boy and 4 yr old girl asked to watch something else.
3,A good average read about a Mustang Ace in WWII.,"Loving has written a truthful account of his experiences in WWII. He flew the Spitfire and Mustang in the Meditteranean Area. He shot down 5 German aircraft making him an ace. What I like about this book is the truthfulness and team concept with Loving. He could have talked about his exploits, but rather than make more of them than needed, he wraps them into his experience as a pilot in his group.This is a good solid read about an above average flyboy, who advanced up the ranks. I enjoyed this story about his experiences during WWII."
2,Skip This,"All of th songs blend and become a lump in you ear, Shuffel into great big play list 1000+ songs may do it"
5,Easy To Use,"I love photo pages which are alot easier to use than the magnetic ones, which I do not use anymore.These photo pages, it's very easy to place a photo into the pages, as well as taking it out, you don't have to struggle to do either.To me the plastic is neither too thin or too thick. I think it should hold up ok.A definite plus is that they are acid free, as since you are using these photo pages for photos, putting them into these photo pages will not damage your photos.I wish they came in a larger pack. Maybe they do? I would definitely buy these again."
5,Tracks 2-17 are...so...GOOD!,There are tracks which can be played through stereo while some can be listened to with the volume on low.A great collection of DJs.I recommend these CDs as well : A Night At The Playboy Mansion and Lazydog. Lazydog is outstanding!
4,Crochet to a Different Drummer,This book has great designs. If it is easier for you to follow a diagramthen this is the book for you. If you are an old school crocheter who learned by following directions it may be hard for you to follow the diagrams. It is a clear choice.
1,Used item received,"I am just disgusted that KV pets felt that sending out terribly trimmed and homemade collars was worth the negative feedback. It is clear that this item was either a return or exchange. I don't blame the person who did. It is one of the most shameless sales I have witnessed through Amazon, which I just love. The collar is nothing as pictured. It's basically a thick plastic hand-trimmed by using a template to trace. Even the edge shows the uneven scissor cuts. I will post a clear photo of the used item right out of their package."
1,A Waste of Time,"Berlin's ""hidden history"" remains hidden in this uninformative, self-indulgent pastiche. The film makers spend too much time on out-the-window shots from the S-Bahn, without even trying to identify the passing sights. Tendentious disquisitions on famous sights fail to identify the sites, the neighborhoods, or even streets and surrounding buildings. Too little history and too little geographical information make this film a waste of time."
2,Big disappointment,"This is a bad documentary. The book it was based on was wonderful and informative. And Berlin itself is one of the most interesting and historically important cities in the world. So how can the film be so bad? It shows many, many buildings, landmarks and sites without telling you what they are and why they're important. I only know, from having read the book. This film seems to focus more on medieval history than on the last hundred years. It offers no insights and very explanations of why the building or site you're seeing is important. What a waste. This could have been so useful or at least interesting. Save your money. Read the book."
2,"I have very thick, damaged dry blonde hair","I bought this in hopes of being able to use it as a pre-shampoo treatment, then wash & condition, and add a little to my wet/damp hair. It made my hair starchy.So I thought I'll just use it as a body oil, the smell is like fresh fruit. but it did not moisturize my skin either."
3,Text is Ok but avoid Kindle version - Photos in B&W,"Good intro text to GI nursing but get the paper version. For some strange reason, Kindle version is in B&W; which does NOTHING for viewing the endo pics of various diseases.UPDATE: 7/11/12 My stupid. I ordered the book and it arrived today (ridiculous cost for paperback) and again, the endo pics were black and white. Fairly useless."
3,My dog loves these but...,"I have to agree that I am not comfortable with treats made in China, and also find it difficult to believe in the all-natural, cage-free claims. Why not make them in the U.S.? I am trying to decide if I should keep the ones I already have or throw them away and get something I trust. The company claims they test for many dangerous chemicals and additives, but some enterprising criminal somewhere is bound to come up with something that nobody has thought to test for, imo. That's what I'm afraid of. *sigh*"
5,Don't knock it til you try it,"My dog has a million allergies and a very sensitive stomach, but he loves these chicken rounds. He needs simple ingredients, no fillers. It definitely gives me pause when I read here that it's made in China, but we've been giving him these for years and he's never had any trouble digesting them."
2,made in China,"After reading an article today about the FDA cautioning pet owners about chicken jerky and chicken strips made in China, I am wondering if that is what caused my dog do be so ill (and $380 in vet bills) three weeks ago, a few hours after eating a Vitality Chicken Breast strip. He has eaten them in the past and loved them and has since (before I read the article) had a few more from the same package without incident. His illness (throwing up, bloody stool, loss of appetite) might be unrelated but I am throwing away the rest of the package and staying away from dog foods made in China."
4,dogs love them,"An easy high protein snack that my dogs love. I am not sure about the fat content, but I give them alone in the a.m. as their ""meal"", and feed them dinner at night."
2,I never finished it,"Maybe I'm getting soft, a book glorifiying a man living like an animal roaming around killing all the lions and bears he can find because it is his religious duty, does not appeal to me. Today we refer to those guys as bums. If your a hunter or houndsman I have a hard time imagining that you would enjoy this book, honestly it is not really interesting, or well written. I stopped reading it about halfway through. If your looking for a good book on running hounds check out ""the long walkers"" or ""call of the hounds"""
1,not worth it,"This basically over moisturizes and isn't to be used daily, despite the claim that it can be used as a daily cleanser. It is much to oily, which actually blocks poors. The skin is certainly moist, but I didn't feel it was clean. As a matter of fact, the salt based products from Trillium organics are better for hands and feet because the amount of salt they are made with is overbearing for gentle skin."
4,"Fine performance, great sound","This is a very fine performance of the Scheherezade. However, i felt that it was just a bit too analytical to take fire and that the soloist, whilst very good, was just a bit too ""thin"" in tone here and there to equal the classic Krebbers contribution with the Concertgebouw (another fairly analytical orchestra). Still well worth listening to as a performance and very rewarding as a recording, with a big dynamic range and a forceful but still natural sound.strings, including the soloist,"
1,This Recording Is A Total Dud,"This recording is a total dud and is to be avoided at all costs. I think this is the worst performance of Scheherazade I have ever heard. It is the worst conducted and the worst played, even worse than the many quick, budget-label runthroughs going back to the 1950's with unknown orchestras and unknown conductors. Each of the standard Scheherazade recommendations vastly exceeds this lame performance. For a good unknown recording, try the Dorati/Minneapolis Mercury recording. Just about any performance from the past is superior to this. If modern sound is a major criterion, get the Chung on DG."
3,Great story .....but,"If you are a fan of the show you will love the book series, however, the author of this book, John Whitman should fire his editor. At the end of the story the AG is talking to the President, and gives him some information that is later contradicted in the remaining pages. I do not want to tell you what that information is, as not to ruin it for others. I read it over and over again to see if I missed something. It was the editor that missed it. I won't say anymore. Just read it for yourself. I did enjoy the book, but this flaw at the end left me scratching my head."
2,Disappointing,"As a fan of the TV show I looked forward to reading novels based on '24'. The first book I read (Operation Hell Gate) was a decent novel and it supplemented the down time between seasons. With respect to this book, however, I would agree with other comments that have been made - generic thriller, plot holes, confusing timing, poor character development, inconsistencies, and some editing errors.I also have a personal gripe with this book (and others that are based on popular TV shows). Television is obviously regulated on what can be said and shown to viewers, and I wish authors would adhere to these same rules for the sake of consistency. For example, the language in this book is very graphic. Jack finds himself in the same stressful situations as seen on TV, yet in the novel he (and others) let the expletives fly. I found this to be very disappointing."
4,Another Thriller,"The writer continues to bring the characters to life as in the series. Jack Bauer, CTU and the supporting cast are well represented."
5,Super DSL filter,I bought this to replace a broken DSL filter and it is absolutely excellent. No static on the line. The phone plugged into this filter is as clear as a bell. The Belkin filter is sturdy and well crafted. Highly recommended.
5,Basic - Simple - Easy!,"Pretty simple to use a line filter - just be sure to add one to every jack. The package comes with three line filters, which is a great value for the money. Single packages on Amazon run as high as $9.99 each - do yourself a favor and buy a three-pack, just to save on your shipping costs!"
5,DSL Filter,"The DSL Filter arrived on time, packaging was in tack and I put it right to use, it works great."
2,Low quality circuit,This DSL filter uses two single winding chokes and one capacitor. A minimal circuit like this is prone to altering the tonal quality of voice calls or diminishing upload performance on some telephone lines.
5,"FOR ONE THING, IT'S ""BELA""","Detailed overview of this gifted/troubled actor's collection of films. As with all performers, there are classics and clinkers and all are covered. Death hasn't dimmed his star-power in the least, as his films are still shown and appreciated. Throughout television, film festivals, video and DVD releases, Bela Lugosi remians one of the most recognized icons in film history. This volume serves him well."
4,Fascinating....,"Amongst the thousands books that I have read, Overload would rank as one amongst the top. The character of Nim Goldman if potrayed as a man of character and intergrity but with very human weaknesses.If you can put yourself in Nim Goldman's shoes, you will come across complex situations and drama that will be a test your very being and assumptions.There is a deep plot, and many sub plots that will keep one spellbound. One amongst the most memorable scenes in the book is the encounter of Nim Goldman making love to a quadraplegic.This makes one think, of the moral and ethical dilemma that Nim has to face. The question you should ask your self is what would you do in such a situation.? (Why should making love to a quadraplegic be wrong.? Or should it be considered odd.?)This and other situations in the book make you to confront your own sense of morality.It is a dramatic and a touching book, only fault is the building of the plot is a bit slow, but worth it."
4,A Great book,"I recently read this novel and was moved from the heart. I actually began to feel that I was a part of the plot. Hailey's knowledge of the subject even though is incredible, he never bores the readers with technical jagron.Hailey succesfully mixes personal life with professional life in this novel. Perhaps the discription of the final fate of Karen is the most moving. Ruth emerges as the strongest person in the novel and Nim even though seems a good human at times he looks villanous( perhaps that depends on individual perception ).Perhaps the only drawback is some cheap scenes which look like to have been added to draw in more men.At the end of the novel I felt as if ending should have been different, that Ruth should have been mentioned.Anyway all in all a wonderful read."
2,disappointing ending,"I agree with the other reviewer that was disappointed in the ending. I found the book to be interesting and likedgetting some history and Bible lessons while reading it. However,the ending made me want to throw the book down. I'm not even sure what the author intended by that ending. I felt very let down. Luckily, I picked up this book secondhandor I think I would have been very peeved."
2,Disappointing ending,"There is a reason this book is out of print already, having just been published in 1995. And the reason is the ending. I was really getting into this book, and the idea of the story seemed an excellent one. Jesus is on trial, accused of fraud. Is he who he says he is? Witnesses are called, including his father Joseph, his mother Mary, Pontius Pilate, Charles Darwin and even Sigmund Freud. But then the ending! I really was hoping for so much more. It just ends, with a flash of lightning, and a one liner comment. Even with the one liner all in CAPITAL LETTERS, it didn't do anything for me. I was very disappointed. The authors should have been able to do a much better ending to this book than what they did."
5,Great!!!,I really like this album and i'm suprised that no one before me recognized it on this site!!! It's great for just listening and relaxing.
4,A Classic,"It's one of the classic turntables out there & it's built like a tank. Mine (at least the one I picked up) of course didn't come with a stylus so you will have to get one of those... but it's a great turntable. Good sound quality (depending on the stylus you use - try Grado's if you've got the cash to burn) and well made.Except for one design flaw... the output wiring. The output wiring (white/red) that you would put into your mixer or phono pre-amp isn't that great. That wouldn't be so annoying - except that you have to dis-assemble the bottom of the table (just unscrew the mat) to actually be able to unplug the bloody thing to make the changes and put a better cable in there or replace the cable if need be... and you DO NOT want to do that or void your warranty if it's new. Cables bust & go bad... IMO they should've made it easier to dis-assemble that & not built it into the table.But otherwise, it's a great table that'll do you well with the right mixer & cartridges, of course."
5,D.J. RA's table review,"The technics direct drive table that you are looking at is a great buy for anyone. The technics tables have a great rep. amoung D.J's for being a very well built and sturdy turntable. A direct drive is they way to go if you are looking to do any back cueing, and scratching. This is due to the fact that a belt driven turntable will burn the belt and distroy the motor. If you are planing to listen to your old records eather one will do. James D. Higgins D.J. RA Exit Only Entertainment"
5,Early Welk,"This is just terrific early stuff by Lawrence. Don't expect his modern band sound with this one. This has gotta be from the 30's.Quite frankly,when my sister first heard it,she didn't even recognize it as Lawrence.If you like the fast music from the 30's..this is for you."
4,Great music,"Great polka and waltzs. My mom has watch lawrence Welk for years, so knew she would enjoy the CD. It's worth purchasing it for listening pleasure."
5,Courageous Prophet,"Richard Kew makes predictions about the future of the church by identifying current world trends and suggesting how they will impact the way we ""do church."" The author names ten trends, such as globalization, fiscal challenges, and moral dilemmas, and offers insights on how the church needs to revision its way of doing ministry in order to address the extraordinary challenges and changes that are sweeping our world. Each chapter is devoted to a ""trend,"" complete with the author's analysis, study guide questions, suggestions for further reading, and websites to search for more information. Our church board is currently reading Brave New Church and we will be discussing the study guide questions in future adult forums. I especially appreciate the website references, and have found them to be very useful and practical. I recommend this book to any church leader who wants to be more effective in doing mission and ministry in our rapidly changing world."
1,Broke after two months,"I bought this hairdryer on May 29 and it broke today, July 14th. I have had several parlux dryers and this is the only one that I bought online. It just stopped working while I was in the middle of drying my hair and started emitting a burnt plastic smell. Unfortunately for me, I just moved and don't have my receipt anymore. I do not recommend this seller."
1,"Piece of garbage, died after 9 months 24/7 service","I bought this about 9 months ago and it served me well until tonight, when the lights flash strangely (even with nothing attached).This is the third D-Link branded gigabit switch that died on me within a year of service. I'll never buy D-Link again, absolute, unmitigated garbage."
1,18 months is not acceptable for a service life,"I bought this device some time ago:Instant Order Update for Mike. You purchased this item on August 30, 2008.It went kaput today, no lightning storms or anything, the power light is on, but none of the ports will read Ethernet cables, nor will they light up when inserted on a network.I'm thinking next time buy something a little higher end that will last more than 18 months. This is a piece of junk if it goes out so quickly, I won't be buying a D-Link again any time soon."
1,The best switch,This is the best switch I ever have plugged it into my D-Link router and data came pouring out of all ports like flash. It works faster and efficient.
3,faulty,"I ordered 5 of these switches and after usage of them for about a month, 2 of them died on me. The switches will no longer power on."
2,"Great at first, then died after 2 years",This switch was very speedy and quiet at first. Then it decided to die on me exactly 2 years after I bought it. I guess I can't complain too much because every consumer switch or router from any company I've had died after 2-5 years.
1,Emits a lot of interference from its power supply,"While the unit appears to ""function"" OK The problem I have is with its power supply. It emits an anoying humm like sound on any AM radio turned on (including battery powered) withing a hundred feet or so. The source of this was easily verified by substituting another power supply with similar rating I had laying around. The noise was even present when nothing is connected to the switch and all devices that would be connected are powered off. Three E-mail attempts at support have gone unanswered, several attempts at phone support were a waste of time. They wanted me to run diagnostics etc. on my computer systems ???? Right... for a bad power suppoly that has been verified as defective by substitution and on a set-up where no PC's are even directly connected. The problem is completely gone with another power supply."
5,plug and play,"Since I had a D-Link router, I went with the D-Link switch. Pluged all the wires in the proper places, turn it on and it work with no problem nothing to reconfigure. It even seems that my internet connect is working faster with this switch, but don't ask me why, because I couldn't tell you.The switch has really helped out because of the computers on the 1st floor and my PS3 is in the basement."
1,"They work well, but die quickly","I've had two of these pieces of junk.For a D-Link product, I expected them to work for more than just a few months. Both of mine have died within 6 months. They light up and show link, but no packets are passed. The power supply is good (proper voltage/amps), but the darn things just drop dead.While they were alive, they worked well. At their current prices, they are disposable. But I expect them to last longer."
2,Failed after 12-18 months,"I liked this switch and bought a second for my home network after a few months. They both died a couple of weeks from each other. Similar symptoms to those listed in other reviews. I emailed D-Link support to ask about issues with the product. They claimed that they didn't know of any similar issues that were common to this product and directed me to tech support for troubleshooting. Given there isn't anything that can be done with hardware like this that didn't seem productive.So, they worked great for a while, were at a good price point, and what I needed. Just didn't live very long."
5,This Unit does its Job,"I have a PC, laptop, and HDD attached to this Gigabit Ethernet switch. I have not experienced any problems with the unit over the 32 months I have used it."
5,best wired router you can choose,This is the easiest and best router for the money you can get. I tried other brands.......this one is just plug and play.......It works right out of the box. I can't tell any difference in the speed on my two pc's either. It is dummy proof...which I needed. The price is great and it's small enough to hide under the desk.
1,Did not receive rebate,You know the multitude of requirements which make actually getting the rebate shouted about in the large print so improbable. Watch out.
2,Get the extended warranty,Watch out for this switch when it is over 1 year old. It will quit. I bought 2 at different time and shortly after the 1 year warranty each died. Get an extended warranty or don't get one. Other than that they worked great for the year they worked.
3,Worked great... for a couple of years.,"It worked as expected for a little over two years (26 months), and then just died. I had it connected to a UPS and hadn't had any issues previously, but one day my connection went down and when I inspected the switch I noticed I couldn't get any of the ports to work. Two of the indicator lights are always on (even with no cables connected to them) but they're all dead.I read that some other reviewers had issues with their power converters, but I don't know if that's my case; I haven't had the chance to buy another one and see if it works.So, bottomline, it has a good price and works very well for some time, but there are definitely some reliability concerns."
2,"Worked fine, then died after 2 years","The switch is simple enough. Easy to install, and worked without fuss for two years. Then one day, it died. Just a green power indicator light, and no Ethernet activity. I give this unit very poor marks for reliability. Get a Trendnet switch. Metal enclosure, 5 year warranty. This is the last D-Link product I'll buy."
4,"quiet, cool, and fast","I had been buying the Netgear gigabit switches (5 and 8 port) for work, as the metal cases appealed to me, and they seemed as though they'd be tougher and harder to damage. That may be true, but 2 of 5 have died within months.So I'm trying this and thus far like it. It runs very cool, and I haven't hear the noise that another reviewer noticed, even though I'm using it in a pretty quiet apt.I'm taking off one star as the case is pretty cheap plastic. Shouldn't matter for my use, but it would be easy to damage this.Dave"
1,"Don't buy, short lifespan","My DGS-2205 worked fine for 13 months, now it just dies every once in a while. The power light stays on, but the port lights go off and the switch is inoperative. It will sometimes come back on it's own, or a power cycle will bring it back to life, but if it won't stay up it is of no use to me."
2,Only worked for 18 months,"The DLink seemed to work great for the first 18 months, then one morning I woke up and it was dead. Just one light comes on. Meanwhile my Netgear WGR614 Wireless Router has outlasted this switch, 2 internet providers and at least 2 computers."
5,Excellent switch,"I ordered two of these - received version C in case any one is wondering what version is shipping these days. Opened them up, plugged them in, and went to work. No issues at all. Later on I looked at the manual on the included CD (there is no printed manual included). Of course you don't really need it unless you want to understand the color coding on the LEDs. They change color depending on the speed each port is operating at. Really nice that these work out of the box with nothing to set up or install. Highly recommended."
5,Perfect in my living room,"I've got this sitting on the computer in my living room that's connect to my HDTV. The switch comes off a CAT-6 line from the main computer in the basement and connects to the computer, PS2, Wii, and HD-DVD player. (There's a Blu-Ray drive in the computer.) It's run for months without a single problem, allows for full Internet connectivity and handles the HD streaming I run through it all the time. I can't recommend a better small switch than this one. In fact, I'll be buying another one soon to hook up some extra devices in the basement."
5,D-Link DGS-2205 Gigabite Switch Review,Excellent product. Works well with no configuration. Plug and play with autosensing ports. Recommended for anyone with a need for a small gigabite switch.
2,Sensitive to electronic noise? Purchase the DGS-2208 instead,"I purchased a DGS-2205 hoping that the 5-port model would be as decent and efficient as the DGS-2208 (8-port model). I was wrong.The 5-port model emits high-pitch noises when any of the front panel LEDs are turned on or off. The noise is emit from the base unit itself and not the power supply. Safe to say some people won't be able to hear this noise, but it's quite noticeable to those of us who have sensitive hearing. I had Amazon send me a replacement unit, which had the exact same problem. Interestingly enough, the DGS-2208 uses the same power supply as the DGS-2205. Therefore, I'm left to believe there's a hardware engineering flaw in the 5-port model.Other than this problem, the unit seems functional. However, note that at least in the case of the DGS-2208, there are multiple versions (1st and 2nd revision) floating around.For a full review of the DGS-2208, see my Amazon review for that product."
2,Good but failed - two units!,"Today, the second of our twin units (bought at Amazon in 2009, 2 years 6 months ago) failed. Within 3 weeks of each other. That smacks of planned obsolesence. The units worked fine until - nothing,one yellow light (#5) and the rest blank. Resetting did nothing. I trust d-link and they have good products (we have 6 other of their components here) but this switch is NOT reliable. Sorry D-link."
5,Great switch,"I actually bought this one as a gift for my dad, who had recently purchased a new USB & Network printer. He was constantly switching the USB cables between his two laptops and desktop to use the printer. Without any help from me, he was able to install the switch, hook up the network printer, reconfigure the printers from USB to network and get everything working. He loves having the freedom of being able to print from any computer without having to worry about switching cables. I purchased this particular switch because I already own two of these myself and use one in my den and one in my computer room. I have owned them for several years without a problem, and hooking up wired to them gives me the fastest speed available to my Gigabit Router."
3,Save your box and everthing inside.,I bought one of these earlier this year and it went bad. I called D-Link and they were nice but it took forever to get an RMA number. Then you find you have to return everything in the box including the CD and rubber feet! This thing has a three year warranty so be advised to keep everything together with proof of purchase. Then it cost me almost about half of what it cost to buy the unit just to ship it back. They will cross ship with a credit card but it will take up to 30 days to see the credit back. To be fair the unit worked well and I had no issues with it until it failed.
3,"Decent Switch, dies quickly","purchased my first dlink gigabit switch back in 2009 and have bought numerous since, at least 4, including at least one 8-port switch. Have had issues with power supplies and having the switch simply die. Easy to deploy and stack. Issues could be with limited venting of device causing overheating, but no sure. Looks like they have decent warranty, but I think when I purchased them, it was easier to simply toss out and buy a new one from amazon. This is a discontinued model, but felt like adding my two-cents in case any one even thought about buying this for the list price of $80 bucks currently on amazon's site."
4,Strange yet familiar,"Yearwood is an unexpected book. On the one hand, it is full of half-familiar, half-remembered names from Celtic and Gaelic lore, old themes of selkies (""selchies""), speaking crows (think of the Northern Ravens), islands in the seas and other witcheries. For me the cadence took some getting used to, although 20-odd years ago when I read more of the older fantasies and original materials it would not have seemed so odd. The wounded hero, Finn, is not weak, but a mixture of ignorant and arrogant, the way youth and beauty can and should be. I think it is a very good book, but it is not fast and easy going, and it is not just the same old same old rehash of Americanized pop pseudo-Celtic themes. I am looking forward to reading Undersea and Winterking also. If you liked this melange of familiar yet not quite the same, you might like Tad Williams' To Green Angel Tower."
1,Not a very good product,"There were no instructions, so I gave up trying to figure out how to get it to work."
2,Broke the first time i used it,"The first time i tried it, the grinding mechanism broke. and i tried it with cumin seeds!!! i don't recommend it."
5,Read this book 25 times,"I owned this book when it first came out, and read it so many times it became too ragged to read. Recently I borrowed it from my local library and was pleased to note that some events took place near my home; specifically Ben's house on River Rd. (near Princeton NJ) in Bucks County.Does anyone know what happened to the author? Married? Children?"
4,"Swapping tales on ""The Life Swap"".","""The Life Swap"" sits on my bedside table, ready for me to pick it up at almost any time. I bought this book about 20 years ago on the ""sale"" table at a Long Island book store and quickly became absorbed in it. It gave me a glimpse into the early-70's, when I had graduated from high school and lived on the fringe of that generation. I enjoyed it thoroughly and thought it reflected the times, the life choices, and the baby boomers in a realistic and entertaining light. Years later, I have wanted to read a sequel--to see how Nancy Weber (who pulled no punches on her choices and lifestyle) and the other people featured in the book have lived their lives during the past 28 years."
4,"Detailed look at WWII Aviation films, from 1939 to 1985.","Mr. Oriss has written a very nice book. ""When Hollywood Ruled the Skies"" is a fairly detailed look at the aviation film classics dealing with World War II. ""Air Force,"" ""God Is My Co-Pilot,"" ""The Flying Tigers,"" ""Midway,"" ""Wake Island,"" ""A Wing and a Prayer,"" ""Fighter Squadron,"" ""The War Lover,"" ""Twelve O'Clock High,"" and many many more. Oriss includes plot summaries, production notes, box office figures, and other interesting details, as well as over one hundred photographs. Although not every WWII-related aviation film is listed, Oriss got most of them.My only complaint--there isn't a sequel!!!"
1,Wont Last Long,"Purchased this about 4 months ago to try and save some money with an aftermarket thermostat. Worked well for about 3 months then failed shut. An item that follows ""you get what you pay for""."
5,Jesus Christ Framed Poster,The frame of this beautiful poster turned out to look even better than I expected; it completes the picture of Jesus so as to make the entire package appear more expensive. I'm sure that anyone purchasing this item will be just as satisfied as I am with it.
1,BAD QUALITY,"Distorted and a very bad copy. The image was streched and elongated, colors are dark and there are streaks apparently from the printing process. beware.the image was stretched and elongated not like the original."
4,Fits and works,"Given the different Fiskars cutters I was nervous about whether this would fit my older machine, but it does. The plastic is a bit firm/tough but the cuts are clean. Perhaps a little more downward force is needed than I expected, but that may be the cutter blade. I look forward to years of use from the four sides to the cutting bar."
1,Fiskars cutting strip,"The picture is the product I ordered, however what I received was very different from the photo. The bar is four sided and black, not two sided and tan. It doesn't fit my fiskars cutting board. Check, check and triple check what you order online is my suggestion."
1,Not what is shown OR what I needed for my rotary trimmer,"I own an older Fiskars 45mm rotary cutter. After much use, the rubber-like strip on which the paper sits to be cut is worn and damaged. After looking at a few local hobby stores for a replacement (without luck), I was pleased to find it online at Amazon. The photo of this product appears to be exactly what I needed - a glue down, thin strip to replace the cutting surface of my trimmer. HOWEVER, when I received the product, it is a four sided cube-like plastic BAR which can NOT be used with my trimmer. .....If you are looking to replace the thin, rubber strip onto which the paper is cut, THIS IS NOT THE RIGHT PRODUCT and is not what is pictured."
4,Good pots!,"These are a very good product. Good finish, they seal quicker than other pressure cookers I have used in the past, and they heat much more evenly across the bottom of the pan.I have no complaints at all about them, except that the pressure release mechanism is a bit more complex than the old fashioned weight-on-a-post method. Some people might wish to have multiple pressure settings (not available), but I see no need for anything less than full pressure."
4,"Great, but not perfect for cleaning","The function of this product is great.The only drawback is that the top of the pot where the handle is connected to can not be removed in order for me to clean it. But other than that, it heats up really quick, and safe to use."
5,New pressure cooker user,I love these pans. We've had numerous wonderful dishes and everything comes out so tender. Very glad we purchased them.
2,faulty product,"I thought I got a good deal, but after using it for the 1st month, the rubber kit would start swelling after put on stove,I called the Fagor main office in New york and ordered another rubber gaskit, but it started doing the same thing. I believe its the lid of the cooker to blame for. eventually I had to buy a regular pressure cooker locally. very dispappointed."
2,Fagor Splendid 5-Piece Pressure Cooker Set Made in China!,"This review applies to the Fagor 2-by-1 Splendid 5-Piece Pressure Cooker Set (4qt, 6qt, pressure lid, glass lid, and strainer). I did a lot of research prior to buying this product as I was looking for a good Stainless Steel pressure cooker that was NOT made in China. The other reviews I had read and local shopping for other Fagor products (This specific product is not available in my area) verified what I had hoped to be true in that Fagor is manufactured in Spain. I was very disappointed when this product arrived and the box is clearly marked ""made in China"". The pots themselves are not labeled at all with country of origin. I have not used them yet and plan to return them."
1,Poor quality/poor service,"I received a pressure cooker like the one here as a wedding present from my parents. I had used mine a couple of times, however my mother had used hers a lot more than me.After a few uses hers exploded causing damage to the kitchen ceiling. She thought it was a one time only, however this kept reoccurring.We have now returned both due to the loss in trust in this product. This is not a product you keep trusting when an incident like this happens where humans and/or pets can be seriously injured.The refund process has now taken over 5 months through Fagor directly.I will never purchase another Fagor product, nor would I ever recommend it to anyone.This product was not purchased through Amazon, but I thought others should know what they're getting themselves into, before purchasing a Fagor pressure cooker."
2,"Made in China, not Spain","The two stars are not for the performance of the product, but for not being made in Spain as described. The package says made in China, and I returned the product due to that. If you have no political or possible quality reliability reasons to stay away from Made in China products, then this may not be an issue, but I would have liked the description to be accurate."
5,Yard Sale Treasure,"I snagged this item at a yard sale on Saturday for $10 (brand new). I am not a novice to pressure cooking but it has been at least 20 years since my old Presto gasket rotted out. This Fagor cooker is sleek, easy to operate and clean, and did a fabulous job on my Sunday dinner. Cheesecake went into the pot, cooked for 5 minutes, and by 7 PM was chilled, creamy, and delicious. Mashed potatoes were perfect in 7 minutes, and a stuffed chicken was moist and tender in 15 minutes. (For safety's sake, I heated the stuffing before putting it in the bird.) The only negative is that the cookbook is unnecessarily obtuse (refer to online recipes for correct timing). Also, I am not really sure what to do with the smaller pan...not sure how to pressure cook in something that size...but I will continue to research it. This product is a joy to use, worthy of the shelf space in my kitchen, and well worth the listed price."
4,The Fagor 2-by-1 --Great Product,The Fagor Pressure Cooker has been a great addition to my kitchen. I am not a gourmet cook but I do most of the day to day cooking. I purchased this item to help reduce the time I spend in the kitchen. I was amazed at the quality of the items in the package and the amazing speed at which I can now cook the most time consuming foods. Beans and Pot Roast are done in less than a half hour. I tried the cheese cake but it was not a success. After discovering the sugar content of cheese cake I have taken it off the menu. Don't need any extra inches around the middle. Get the Fagor it's great.
5,I LOVE IT!,This pressure cooker is so easy to use! Before I bought this pressure cooker I was scared of them. I finally decided I would buy one and give it a try I'm so glad I did! I also bought the book Great Vegetarian Cooking Under Pressure. Buy this you won't be sorry!
5,love it,I love mine so much that this purchase was a Christmas gift.Fagor Splendid 2-in-1 5 Piece Pressure Cooker Set
1,Caution - Extremely Dangerous,After 3 uses the handle of this pressure cooker came off !!!. It caused a big messand almost crushed my glass stove top !!!The handle is not bolted the the pot - Do not buy.
5,Splendid is all You Need,"I have been using this pressure cooker set frequently for a couple of years. I love it. This is the perfect set. The 8 quart capacity is perfect for making a whole chicken, soups, etc. The pan is good for everything else.I don't miss not having the low pressure setting that the Splendid lacks because low pressure is rarely used in pressure cooking. But if you think that you may delicate deserts, consider a pot with a low and high setting."
3,"Not working/defect ""PRESSURE VALVE""","Well,I have used Pressure cookers all my adult live and love them. When it was time to get a new set, I grabbed the opportunity at the special price trough Amazon. Don't get me wrong, the pots are good quality, just on mine, the ""PRESSURE VALVE"" is not working. With other words it is NOT releasing steam unless manually tempered with. I do cook with the pots and the food comes out very good, especially like to cook pork and beef BBQ ribs :)I just have to stick close and ones in a while notch the PRESSURE VALVE and it will release the excess steam/pressure.I e-mailed customer service at Fagor and told them about the problem, but no response what so ever."
5,A Great Pressure Cooker Set,"This is a great pressure cooker set. This set is different from the Fagor Duo set that comes with two pressure settings. We do not need different pressure settings, so the set is perfect for us. The 8-qt one is big enough for a family of four. The set is beautiful in 18/10 stainless steel. I love them. I have cooked several meals in it without any problem. I highly recommend this pressure cooker set."
5,Excellent Pressure Cooker,"This is one of the better pressure cookers on the market and the price is right. You get two pots for the price of one here at Amazon, most other on-line stores charge the same price or more for only a 4 quart or an 8 quart cooker. If you are looking to buy a good pressure cooker and would like the choice of using the four quart or eight quart cooker, you can't go wrong buying this item, in my opinion of course."
4,Great product,"The wine cooler does take a number of times to clean before the chemical smell finally goes, but seems to be a well constructed unit for the price. My only real issue is the spacing of the draws and the fact each draw only holds 11 bottles, 12 would have been nice. The spacing becomes a problem if you have wine from different wineries that use non-standard bottle sizes."
1,DO NOT BUY: AVANTI DOESN'T CARE ABOUT YOUR WINE!,"RE: AVANTI COOLER ACTUALLY FREEZES YOUR WINE AND AVANTI COULD CARE LESSI have had this unit for almost 8 months now and this morning I discovered about 12 bottles had blown their corks. My beloved CA Pinot collection is toast!The ""Set Temp"" LED read 58 degrees F. Right next to it sits the ""Internal Temp"" LED, which read 32 degrees!!!I took pics of this, and of the blown corks, the frost covered wine collection of 90 bottles or so. But Avanti didn't care. I spoke to a superior manager, but she didn't care and said I saved money on the purchase. Avanti could care less about your wine collection. Do not buy their products if you care about your wine. Simple as that./LM"
1,It's junk... don't take a chance,"I purchased one of these... seemed like just the right thing. It arrived non-functional, and it was a problem to get service. Once it was running, it had the problems others have stated in terms of actual storage and shelf design and temp control. But then in less than two years it failed. It stopped cooling. The compressor still works, but it has a leak somewhere and can't cool. Avanti will only replace the compressor, but that is useless, so the unit is useless. They don't stand behind their products, so if you purchase this you are taking a serious risk with your money. I would not buy another!"
4,Good entry level wine cooler,Product looks good and at this point is holding temperature well. The shelves work best for standard size bottles and will only hold a single row of longer bottles. Allow plenty of time for coordinating with the shipping company (over 2 weeks and many phone calls).
1,Avanti Service is very poor,"Avanti Service Center and applicable dealers are non existent, no one including the manufaturer or retailer will support this product, a bad choice."
4,Customer service not as bad as I thought,"I bought this wine cooler and it worked great for 8 months. It went bad suddenly. It took about 1 week total to get a serviceman out to diagnose the problem, then determine it was a leak in the system that could not be repaired. I did get a new unit after about 2-3 additional weeks, not as bad as I thought. I give avanti more credit than the reviews reflect. Maybe their service has improved."
4,Encouraging,"Finally a book that acknowledges the grass efforts of the nameless folks who took up the grass roots call of ""Each one, teach one"" effort in the difficult post-Civil War era. As limiting as it was, there was nothing else in place to address the manmouth job of getting generations of now free African American literate. Interesting, provacative read."
1,Buyer Beware!,"I was among the chorus singing the praises of this monitor until the weekend before Christmas when the monitor died. It started making a weird, warbling electronic hum as the computer started. The image would flicker and dim and finally just went black. I plugged it into another computer to make sure that it was truly the monitor and it was. I had owned the monitor for sixteen months. Nice monitor while it lasted, but when measuring cost versus useful lifetime - this monitor is a very poor value.By the way, written inquiries to ViewSonic have gone ignored. Very dissatisfying experience, both in terms of product quality and customer service."
3,The Q9b is good but...,"We already had three of the 17"" predecessors to this monitor and were very happy with those, so I decided to purchase this one. Overall, it's as good as the 17""'s, except for some reason, the Q9b has a viewing angle issue that should be addressed. Looking directly at the screen in the middle of it appears the brightest and it looks good, but the edges appear darker and slightly green. While it's a little bothersome, it's not a significant enough issue to me to worry about it. Again, overall, it's a great monitor with sharpness, great contrast and color; viewing angle is the only real down side."
1,VIEW SONIC & OPTIQUEST ARE THE WORST!!! BEWARE,"THIS IS THE WORST CUSTOMER SUPPORT I HAVE EVER ENCOUNTERED. MY MONITOR WENT BLACK SHORTLY AFTER ONE YEAR (WHICH SEEMS TO BE VERY COMMON WITH THEIR PRODUCT). I CALLED AND TOLD THEM I HAD A 3 YR WARRANTY. THEY TOLD ME IT HAD BEEN CHANGED TO A 1 YEAR AND HUNG UP ON ME. I PERSISTED AND TOLD THEM THAT IT WAS NOT LEGAL TO CHANGE A WARRANTY. I FINALLY WAS ABLE TO FAX INFO (HAD TO DO IT TWICE) TO PROVE I HAD A 3 YEAR WARRANTY AFTER SEVERAL MORE FRUSTRATING CALLS. I WAS FINALLY GIVEN AN RMA NUMBER AND I MAILED MY MONITOR BACK 5 WEEKS AGO. I WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE A REPLACEMENT IN 2 WEEKS. AFTER 3 WEEKS, I CALLED BACK AND WAS TOLD THEY DIDN'T HAVE A REPLACEMENT UNIT FOR ME AND I WOULD JUST HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL THEY GOT ONE. IT HAS NOW BEEN ALMOST TWO MONTHS OF PHONE CALLS AND FRUSTRATION AND I STILL HAVE NO RESOLUTION IN SIGHT. THEY ARE LIARS. STAY AWAY FROM VIEWSONIC AND OPTIQUEST."
2,Not so good,Picture quality is not what I was expecting. Maybe this is what you get when you go cheap.
4,Love it!,"I bought this for my 5 year old son because he's really into the Super Friends right now. I knew this wouldn't be violent and I wouldn't have to worry about context. He loves it! He doesn't get all of the voice over information, but it doesn't matter. He loves the characters and the action."
5,Challenge of the Super Friends,I bought this as a present for my grandson. I assume that he likes it. I think that it would be great!
5,Challenge of the Super Friends - The First Season,Well seeeing these episodes sure brings a person back to more simple times. These cartoons are great and you have to love the good vs evil scenerio. If you love superheros taking down the bad guys then you will love these episodes.One of my favorite episodes on this disc would be SECRET ORIGINS OF THE SUPER FRIENDS.If you like the Super Friends you will love this collection
5,Superfriends,"While babysitting our friends' son and daughter, the topic of superheroes came up. The superheroes of today have nothing on the Superfriends we grew up watching. They spent two hours on the computer just learning about all the superfriends, the Hall of Justice, and the Legion of Doom. The boy's birthday was the next week and the choice for a present was a no-brainer. He loved it. Now he and his sister can enjoy the superheroes we all grew up watching."
1,Very disappointing,"First, I have to say that I did not watch this show as a kid, so I am not as indulgent as I would have been if nostalgia and happy memories prepared me to watch this. By today's animation standards, this series is almost unbearable to watch. The scripts were obviously written by people who only had very superficial knowledge of the characters. Dialogues and situations are so clumsy that they verge on parody. Although the characters designs are faithful to their comics look of the time, the animation is mediocre and ""action"" is reduced to a minimum. Limited animation was used way better on other Hanna Barbera productions such as Johnny Quest. So my advice is : if you have not watched this when you were a child, and if you enjoy ""Batman the animated series"" , ""The adventures of Superman"" , ""Justice League"" and the other great series produced by Warner in the 90s and later on, dont inflict this on you even by curiosity."
4,Challenge of the Superfriends,"Excellent packaging with double sided discs. Two key episodes ""Wanted: The Superfriends"" and ""History of Doom"" feature an audio commentary by DC Comics staff working on the current printed page adventures of Superfriends characters like the Flash. Here's hoping Warner releases every season of Superfriends on DVD, including the preceding one hour Superfriends shows from 1973 & 1976."
5,Challenge of the SuperFriends first season!,"Challenge of the SuperFriends first season (1978) is now on DVD! This series is based on the Justice League of America comic books by DC comics! The first season has the all the popular Justice Leagure characters are Superman, Batman, Robin, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Flash, Green Lantern, Hawkman, Samurai, Apache Chief, and Black Vulcan. These Superheroes fight for truth, justice, peace, and the american way. The Super villians are the Legion of Doom. The leader of the Legion of Doom is Superman's most famous villian, Lex Luthor! This cartoon aired 16 episodes in 1978! The Challenge of the SuperFriends is one of the most popular 1970s cartoons because it featured the most popular characters in the DC comics Library! Challenge of SuperFriends is awsome! Highest Possible Recommendation! A"
2,This is not the complete Challenge Of The Superfriends,"I remember watching Challenge Of The Superfriends and it was an hourlong show. The first story was a Superfriends story which had the main Superfriends (Superman, Batman, Robin, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, the Wondertwins and Gleek) followed by the Legion Of Doom stories. Now I don't know whether the Superfriends stories shown on Challenge were wiped or whether the people putting out this collection are deliberetly ignoring those stories. Regardless of the reason, this is not a complete Challenge Of The Superfriends collection and I won't buy any Challenge collection unless it's complete because it's only fair to us if it is complete."
1,What people still watch this,"With the new Justice League show, which is fantastic by the way, does this old show have any reason to excist. The animation is very poor but since the 70s had poor budget and technological limitations this is forgivable everything else is not. The characters are corny much like the also horrible live action Batman show. The characters are flat lame and with no personality. Batman and Robins relationship is so wrong I can't even say. The worst is the wonder twins. These aren't in the comics with good reason. Its a shame they had to put childish characters like this in place of the real heros. The new show Justice League currently airing uses most of the stories of this cartoon but actually does them well. So really I can't think of a reason to watch the show today."
2,Setting surpasses story.,"Lush scenery and gorgeous decor do not disguise one more insipid Italian male fantasy movie.An immature, virginal man falls in love/lust with a temporarily blind, shallow, young socialite who well knows how to manipulate and excite men. The movie fails as comedy because Nello lacks any gravitas and his lust is merely pathetic. The movie fails as tragedy because Nello's experience does not change him. Instead of gaining maturity from his experience, Nello ends up happily sewing garments for the Pope in his father's shop - no more having an independent, creative life in Bologna.Most damning, it is impossible to identify with the main characters since they are so unrealistic. But perhaps in Berlusconi's Italy, a whorish young beauty and a feckless,immature man who never grows up are standard fare."
2,Sorry Rick..,"Love EVERYTHING Rick Springfield... Love all the songs he chose to do on this album. But, sorry, love the original artists doing them."
1,Awful,"At 36, I am one of those women who fell in love with RS as a pre-teen, and grew up with him. I was really looking forward to this one after SDAA, which I personally thought was his best album since Tao. Like other RS fans, I can usually find something to appreciate with any of his albums- not so with this one. This album is terrible. I could tolerate Not in Love - the rest of the album was just a weak, string of songs that could at best make me fall asleep. This is honestly the first RS album I've ever bought that I never play!"
1,Phoned-in Performance,"(Jessie's Girl Ringtone)...Hello?...hey Rick its Jimmie at Gomer Records'- how's retirement?...ok Jimmy - I miss playin' but the ideas ain't coming like they used to - what's up?...well how 'bout if I get the band in and we do some tunes...oh I don't know, I'm kinda enjoyin' sleepin' in...that's OK Rick, don't blame ya but how about if I get the band to record the tracks and then, when you feel like it, come in and lay down the vocals-you won't have to argue over arrangments or anything (I won't say anything if you don't)...just show up and sing? can I bring my axe?...yeah sure, you can even plug it in if you want!, whaddayasay Rick? deal? I'll even do the clearance paperwork...let me think about it Jimbo, I'll call you back after I pick up my new frames."
4,Interesting mix of mellow cover tunes,"I'm not sure I understand all of the opposition to this album, especially the criticisms that Springfield has gone ""easy listening."" Sure, Springfield rocked in the 80s, but I've been hearing his songs played on adult ""soft rock"" radio stations for years; this certainly isn't the first time that he has been mellow. I admit, his voice has become weaker and more raspy-sounding, but hey, most of his fans are middle-aged now too, right?I thought Springfield did a nice job with some 80s one-hit wonders, including ""I'm Not in Love,"" ""Life in a Northern Town,"" and ""Broken Wings,"" all of which were at least as good as the original versions. Of course, he couldn't quite live up to John Lennon on ""Imagine,"" but still, this was a decent interpretation. However, I think I most enjoyed the songs that I did not personally recognize, including ""Miss You Nights"" and ""Blue Rose."" Overall, I'm happy I bought this album, and I remain a loyal Springfield fan."
1,So So Sad,"All that I can say is that I am sad...really really sad. Please Rick go back to the studio and perform your own songs...This album makes me want to ""Cry""."
