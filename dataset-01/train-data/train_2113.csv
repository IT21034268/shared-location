4,"Ignore the Review of Helmet, AZ Reader","It's obvious that the reviewer from Helmet, AZ hasn't read the book. He (or she) doesn't mention anything remotely cogent about this novel in particular. It's understandable that he doesn't like Dixon's writing in general, but to slander a writer's new work purely based on personal hatred seems plain wrong.That being said, the novel ""I"" is a remarkably entertaining and funny book. Although the subject matter is alarming, and sometimes grim, Dixon's way of telling of the story always shines with wit. I very much recommend it."
2,Dixon writes with gum and hairballs,Stephen Dixon is a nice man who should have been a mechanic or something. He writes badly and he's done it so long that he's now found a following among people who read badly. Leave them in peace while you seek higher pleasures.
4,Incredible Chops,"A very satisfying and nice performances for the price. The interface of the dvd was a little creakey, but it is ten years old.The sound was good on my Sony TV and I have no complaints. It's all about the music and these guys are incredible artists. My 17 year old and I were wondering if these guys could go in cold and unknown to audition for a present day band. I think they'd be hired. It would be stellar to make that a reality show."
5,This Show Was A Splendor To Behold,I was one of the lucky people who witnessed this show in person at Northrup Auditorium and will always remember it as the show that's my favorite of all time. I've seen Joe Satriani about 4 times and he never disappoints. Steve Vai's set was great and Mike Keneally stole the show there. Eric Johnson was great but he was very subdued compared to Satch and Vai. Overall THE BEST Concert I've ever seen in person. Adrian Legg opened the show and his set deserved to be included also.
5,In one word : Awesome ...,"Three great guitarists, great video quality, absolutely SUPERB sound quality. What more can you want ?"
4,Encore please!!!,"Satriani has such an awesome on-stage/album song energy, if you closed your eyes you would think you were listening to an album demo version of these songs! As for Johnson? Someone throw a Beer at him! It was like he was in studio, he didn't mess up once! The only complaint I could make about him, is that his song ""SRV"" was nothing like Stevie Ray Vaughan's style. And Vai? Well, I saw Him and Satriani in Chicago at their last ""G3"" tour, and I can understand why people like him, but Satriani and Petrucci were so much cleaner, and their songs had much more feeling than his did. That's the way it was their and it's the way it is on here. Still, he's fun to watch mess around on stage, and he's really good at entertaining and including the audience in his performances. Very nice video, even nicer concert!"
3,Eric Johnson Is Amazing!,Satriani and Vai are two of the most annoying and mediocre guitarists I've ever seen/heard. Eric Johnson is absolutely amazing!
2,DISAPPOINTING,"This had so much potential. Arrghhh!! My favorite 3 guitarist, yet the sound is muddied. It should have been recorded in 5.1 (like Satriani - Live in SF). The video is good.THE SOUND IS HORRIBLE THOUGH and THAT'S WHAT MAKES THIS A TRAVESTY.I am so disappointed, as for Concert DVDs, audio is the most important factor. Not even anamorphic."
3,We've seen better,"Slapped together on a shoe string budget, incompetent sound engineers and producers do great injustice to three giants of contemporary electric guitar. Truth be told, two performers-Satriani and Johnson- deliver unmemorable performances on this video. Only Vai appears to come away unscathed, delivering an animated and passionate performance. But, in the end, Vai loses too. During the collective ""jam,"" audio engineers neglected to record Vai's guitar! This is a shame, because it is only in the jam that Johnson, Satriani and the audience start to wake up. This makes one wonder if the three could have better success working as a trio rather than as three separate bands with a jam at the end. Still, the video worth watching. Anyone who questions the lyrical ability of the electric guitar might change his mind after listening to any of these musicians. Or, better yet, listen to the G3 CD where the mix, performances and musical ideas are clearer, sharper and more innovative."
3,I love Joe and Eric. Steve Vai was a mess.,Joe was good. Eric Johnson was very good. Steve Vai was irritating. The jams were pretty good though.Highlight of this album: Manhattan
3,Can make you tired,Though Joe Satriani starts of well the first thing that all this guitaring and shredding makes you do is turn the volume down. By the time Steve Vai goes on stage you've already had enough. I also somehow liked the sound of the Stratocaster more than the Ibanezes. It had a melodic touch to it. Inspite of this the virtuosity of the guitarists can never be undervalued. Great for students of the guitar but for the avid guitar listener it can become very tiresome. Eric Johnson's group where the drummer had a better role to play was also refreshing to watch and listen instead of having to focus all the time on the guitarists as in the performances of Joe Satriani and Steve Vai. Three stars for Eric's performance and the versatility of Satriani and Vai.
5,Eric Johnson's solo...,"During the song ""My guitar want's to kill your mama"", Eric Johnson's solo has totally blown me away!! very impressive musical creativity!"
4,You have to get this G3 DVD and then get the other two,"If you are not an instrumental rock'n roll fan and your blood doesn't boil with some extreme overdrive and other guitar effects, this is not for you. If you are a rock guitar player, this is a must-have. Satriani and Vai, as the backbone of the G3 extravaganza, deliver some of their famous songs with the usual energy and virtuosity. Eric Johnson, I have to say, has a very different personality, melodic approach, and technique from Vai and Satriani, but I think this contrast makes the first edition of G3 a unique jewel that you don't want to miss. Additional material in the DVD is OK. It could be a lot better."
1,ALMOST SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE CONCEPT,"This is an interesting book. It's high concept, low delivery. While it talks about ideas and models, it shows virtually none of them. It's like an art book without the--you know--the SNL would have run this as a script in the 70's. A book about images...without pictures. People like this book because a book about this topic replete with images has yet to be puslished. When it is, this will look like what it is: a good ideas plowered into the ground with lack of understanding of how people view concepts-you know--in pictures."
5,must read!,"If your interested in what is wrong with our society I suggest you look no further, a thought provoking look at how we currently design and build and practical recommendations as to what we should be using as our models."
2,Overall a terrible book,"I was not a happy camper after reading this book. I would say that her writing style is not to my taste, as she uses way too many metaphors and goes on and on about the quirky personalities of the scientists that she is interviewing.Now, when it comes to fields in which I know something about, she does a TERRIBLE job. The is as whole part about quantum consciousness where a particular scientist that is not very well respected in his field (was in the movie What the bleep - worst movie ever) and if she were to interview just about anyone in the field of quantum physics, the whole chapter would have to get thrown out. But did this happen...no. She seems to latch onto research that she likes, and just disregards the rest.Not a good author, not a good book, NOT a good representation of biomimicry!I wish Janine Benyus could give me the week back that it took me to read this book so I could do something more productive!"
3,Biomimicry,This title makes a good attempt to put forth some new ideals in sustainability for business and manufacturing. The author tends toward the idealistic without regard for a number of important counter-arguments. It is also quite esoterical and scientific to such a degree that I would recomend an undergraduate degree in chemistry before attempting to read it.
2,Good subject but poor content,"This book deals with an interesting concept which is 'biomimicry'. In summary, it says that Mother Earth offers many models on which we can base our innovation/creation. But the book is not so easy to read and not so well planned. I skip many parts which in my sense go to deep in details and some parts are a bit repeatitive. The book is quite large but offers only few interesting ideas that are then developed and so detailed to an end which you don't remember the purpose. Some parts don't have a conclusion so you finish the chapter quite frustrated because you have read a big technical part and uoi don't see what was the point the author wanted to demonstrate. If you are interested in technical sciences then you might like it but otherwise, the ideas on biomimicry in this book could be summarize in a more compact book."
2,nonsensical environmental manifesto,"A book that purports to be about taking inspiration from nature for our inventions sounds like a scientific book about genetic engineering or nanotechnology. It's not. This book is really an environmental manifesto, taking ""nature is good"" as an axiom and going from there, to explain unpromising technologies that will allow us to be more like nature and live in harmony with the Earth. The pseudo-religious arguments presented for why we should do this are vacuous. It's just sort of assumed we all would rather make the required sacrifices to ""be in harmony with mother earth"". If that's your thing, this book is for you. Just don't make the mistake I did and buy something that you think has some scientific validity."
3,Biomimicry,"Ms. Benyus's book was for the most part enjoyable to read giving many perspectives of this new emerging science. The book was well written and many of her arguments were compelling. One element was terribly troubling, however, her constant reference to evolution as the source of all things natural. Evolution is the biggest farce of modern science and has been proven invalid in so many ways that to use it as the argument of origins diminishes the value of her work. As I read her book, I kept thinking at each reference to evolution that if she had just left that unsaid or that reference to evolution out, none of the force of her conviction would have been lost. Instead I kept reeling from the evolutionary references. It is too bad that she did not stick to true science."
5,Nurturing from Nature,"I like this book. It calls one's attention to a simple fact - Nature does it better - but it also shows the way to scientists, engineers and the general public - mimmic Nature. Excellent reading for open minds!"
4,"Fascinating topic, covered in the right amount of detail","Overall, I loved this book. I appreciated it from a scientific innovation perspective and for its vision of how society could flourish in symbiosis with nature. There were several sections where I just couldn't put it down. For the most part the level of detail was just right, the science was well explained, and the writing was engaging. I found parts of the biological computation section less than satisfying (too much analogy, not enough specifics), but I might be biased because that topic was closest to my field and I probably wanted more gory detail than the average reader. Even that section, however, included plenty of references and food for thought so I really can't complain. I'm trying to make all of my friends and family read this book if that's any indication about how much I liked it."
2,Overzealous and poorly planned,"When I bought this book I had high hopes for what I would be reading. I thought this book would give many examples of varied uses (and future uses) of biological processes. This book should have been a description of what new and exciting developments are occurring in biology, and how these are being applied to make environmentally friendly alternatives to current technology. What the reader gets is an extremely enthusiastic, repetitive description of one paradigm per chapter. The descriptions are poorly planned however, as they contain too much jargon for the non-specialist reader, and not enough details for a science-educated reader. Many of the descriptions make it clear that the author never understood what she was writing about. Her enthusiasm is admirable, but it translates into extremely long-winded rants. I look forward to a good book written on this topic. This one isn't it."
2,Promising concepts but this book does not deliver,"As a few of the other reviews have pointed out, this book starts with some great ideas but does not provide many real answers. There are many anecdotes about quirky scientists, but few stories with actual success stories. The author's prose veers between fluffy new-age enviro-love letters and overly detailed technical descriptions of biological processes (that would have been better described using a few, clear diagrams). After reading the weak chapter on computer science (my area of study) with a suspicious eye, I question the accuracy of her other technical explanations."
2,"Fascinating topic, dissappointing book","Solar cells modeled after green plants, fibers stronger than steel, chemical factories without pollution, ceramics as hard as abalone shell. Nature has invented many things that outperform engineering feasts, and this is book about nature's innovations.Biomimicry is a hard book to classify: it is partly a popular science book (ca. 50%) but also a manifesto for sustainable development, a collection of miniportraits of scientists, and wild speculation of future engineering applications. All of this is embedded in the Benyus' personal odyssey of figuring out what biomimetics is all about. Lack of clear focus makes this book a difficult read: in the middle materials science exposee Benyus has decided to describe rock climbing hobbies of some prominent materials scientists."
4,Biomimicry - innovation inspired by nature,"have as yet not read the book but will within the next few weeks as I travel abroad and have some quality time while traveling. Thank you for asking, Jan"
4,A Vital Message about Human Consumption Patterns,"Benyus has the difficult task of compiling worldwide innovations in science and development to show how organic processes can be modeled for new inventions, products and services. By literally mimicking natural processes, new scientists are attempting to develop healthier systems of production so that old methods of extracting resources, manipulating them, using them and then throwing the waste back into the biosphere, becomes obsolete. Cheers to her and her colleagues, with hope to this emerging field. Without it, humans are certainly on a shortsighted path."
4,Enlightening. The human race may have a chance after all,Biomimicry gives an insight into where future technology could take us without getting too technical on it's explainations. Benyus takes us into a variety of different natural world arenas and shows us how scientists are working to use millions of years of evolution in our everyday lives. Mother Nature is a smart cookie. We all should listen.
4,"Biomimicry is Very Good, Very Detailed","As other reviewers have pointed out, Biomimicry is a good to great book, but the level of detail is enough to make a non-scientist's head spin. Be prepared for in-depth discussions on cellular activity, computer theory, and energy transfer. The main point of the book is excellent, which is that as a human race, we will eventually have to start acting like the rest of the living world and only use what we have in a sustainable manner. Physically, our path of using more energy than the world can generate is simply not sustainable for long. The book is not one of those alarmist environmental-destruction-is-imminent books however, it actually has good ideas on directions to take for sustainable manufacturing and sustainable energy."
3,First impression,"I'm still reading through, but I was expecting less theory and more practical features/examples. I already had the general background and needed a methodology to put into practice. So far I haven't found it."
2,disappointed,"I ordered this book with great expectations based upon the excellent reviews that it had obtained. Personally I could not finish the book. I had wished for something that would speak of the philosophy of biomimicry. Instead I found a rapidfire, dotcom style, gee whiz book that runs without much depth (though much wide eyed wonder) and seems to spend an excessive amount of time on the personalities behind the science. When you read a thoughtful book on a new subject by an author who has a commnad over it, you can feel it after a few pages. This book, to me, did not deliver that feeling."
4,Great cake decoration,"My son really wanted surfboards on his birthday cake so I was excited to find these! I'd read on other reviews that the fins had broken off, but ours arrived all intact. They are surprisingly sturdy and well made and were a big hit with my son. The little fins did start breaking off once he started playing with them, but for cake decorations they are well made and are perfect if you're looking for a beach/surfing theme."
3,These are cute and looked nice on the cake,"I liked that they were delivered in a timely manner. There were 12 in the package. The only problem was that a lot of the fins on the surfboards were broken off. Didn't make a huge difference in using them since I only needed 5 or 6 of them, but if I had been making cupcakes, it might have been an issue. Good value for the money I thought."
5,Great music of nascent rock and roll.,"Love Roy Brown. Lots of natural talent and professionally sung by an experienced performer. I can listen again and again, which I rarely normally do."
1,ER-D500 Battery Life,"I purchased an ER-D500 battery for my Olympus C60 digital camera on 18 Sep 2005. The battery comes with a 3-year warranty. In February of 2006, it ceased to hold a charge, then refused to charge at all.Expensive battery for 5 months."
3,"Their Old versions were better, the Arditti's supreme","These new recordings from the Juilliard lack the spark that they used to bring to this music, perhaps because Mann (first violinist) was about to retire, and it shows. The Arditti's reign supreme in this repetoire, making this set an also-ran."
1,Failed on a gig,"I always regret writing bad reviews, but one of these adapters failed on a gig that was very embarrasing. I had bought these a couple years ago thinking they would be cheap substitutes for pricier stage boxes. Though it was only used 3 times, I found that the 1/4 inch jack portion of the device was easily damaged with a plug insertion. In addition, the item is pressed and glued together rather than using more sophisticated assembly techniques. This was my first venture into the world of Hosa products, and will regrettably be my last. I guess quality doesn't cost, it pays..."
1,Junk food should not be Yummy!,"My mum just shipped this to us in Argentina, I'm very disappointed in the content. The illustrations are cute but I wish I had read more reviews before ordering. We live in Argentina which is already a really sugar oriented culture. We're trying to keep our son away from too many cakes and cookies, ice creams and coca cola. We already know he gets fed cookies at his Abuela's all the time (he turns 1 this week). I would have much rather had a book that emphasised how yummy fresh fruit, vegetables and healthy meals are. I'm surprised since the author is from the Pacific Northwest -- I would have assumed she would have also gone more for this idea than pizza, fish sticks etc. It makes me wonder what kind of food is on the table in her house!"
5,funny for parents and kids!,Leslie Patricelli's baby books are funny for parents and babies - no mean feat in less than 100 words. This little oval-headed baby is the best. I recommend all of her books for parents of babies and toddlers.
5,YUMMY!!,My son loves these books. Easy to understand and comprehend. The pictures are great and colorful too. Perfect children's book.
5,YOU MUST OWN THIS ONE!!,"The illustrations in this book are incredible, bright, rich and so beautiful to look at. There are only a few words on each page which is really great for the littlest of kids. It is really silly and sweet. They'll sit through this one, for sure! This is a must own book!!!"
4,My daughter loves it,"My daughter, a 2-year-old who's beginning to understand what ""yucky"" means, loves this book. The illustrations didn't do much for me at first, but I've come to enjoy Patricelli's style. We also enjoy her book ""Big Little."""
2,Read before buying,"I love this author-- we have a few of her other books such as Big, Little and Quiet, Loud. My 16 month old daughter absolutely adores them. I was disappointed by the content of this particular book. Things such as chicken, fish sticks, hamburgers, cookies and chocolate sauce are illustrated as being ""yummy"". We happen to be vegetarian so I wish I had known about the animals listed as food items. But beyond that, listing chocolate sauce, cookies and ice cream for this age group is risky. I don't plan on introducing those things to her diet yet so I'm planning on returning the book to Amazon. I think the content should be a bit more baby/toddler friendly, and a bit more health conscious. How about listing apple sauce as yummy instead of chocolate sauce?"
2,"Neat idea, but not for vegetarians","I and my son are both vegetarians. Had I known that ""hamburgers are yummy"", I certainly wouldn't have bought this book. The illustrations are bright and clever, but I agree with another reviewer that this book is funnier for parents. How many kids of the target age know what a mud pie is???"
2,"Cute, but not for everyone","This book has a cute premise and is adorably illustrated. Unfortunately, it seems the author didn't put much thought into making her work accessible to all families. She lauds fish sticks, burgers and chicken as ""yummy,"" thus excluding vegetarians; and lists chocolate and blueberries as ""yummy"" making this book off limits to my food-allergic daughter. (Other highly allergenic foods listed as ""yummy"" include milk and eggs, which should NEVER be given to children under 1 year of age - and yet the drawings depict a very young baby...)"
1,Not for a 2 year old!,"I didn't like the content of this book at all. I always read a book before I buy it for my children & my son got this one for his 2nd birthday. Imagine my surprise when I got to the pages about ""boogies"" and ""ear wax!""I have since hidden the book because I don't think he should know about eating boogies & ear wax....yet."
5,Great on ipad,"I got this for my 21 month old son to read on the ipad. He likes to be involved like his brother and he can also say ""yuck"" so he thought this was fun."
5,This is a Yummy book!,"This book is fabulous! It's colorful, succinct, and as a parent, amusing to read. My baby doesn't understand the words that I'm saying, but someday, she'll see the humor in the book, as well. The parents that are offended by the book need to chill out. If you can't enjoy yourself and find humor in the gross things that kids will do (and they WILL do them), then I think you take yourself too seriously! Lighten up and enjoy the ride..."
5,"This book is YUMMY, other books are YUCKY","This is my daughter's favorite book. There aren't that many good opposite books out there and this one is wonderful. She loves books, but she could read yummy yucky and the 2 others in the series over and over. It is enjoyable for adults too-great illustrations and quite witty-you won't tire of it-believe me-we've read it about 8 times a day since we got it 6 months ago. It is indeed quite YUMMY!"
2,Disappointing,"Too long, too dull. Millar simply did not live an interesting life; he mostly sat around writing. Which is fine, but not worth spending almost 500 pages reading about. There are too many unedited interview quotations from friends and acquaintances who ramble on and on. The main fact I learned was how long-suffering he was in dealing with his mean and difficult wife.The photo section is bad as well: too many pictures of actors who portrayed Archer, not enough of the author himself. And since one of the themes of Macdonald's career was trying to prove that he was not a carbon copy of Chandler, it's ironic that there is a picture of Chandler."
4,ross mcdonald - a biography,"I am an avid reader of mystery novels from the time I was a little girl - being the only girl in my group of friends to read mystery. I loved Lew Archer stories but was not really knowledgeable about the author. When I came across the book in the library, I checked it out and thoroughly enjoyed the book. His life was so wonderful yet pitifully sad. I thought Tom Nolan did a great job doing his research and his talent for writing made the book one that I could not put down until I had completely finished it. I can identify with some of the things McDonald's daughter went through. Her life hit a nerve and I believe Tom Nolan did an excellent job describing that part. I am an aspiring writer myself and I was amazed at the time and effort Tom put into this book. Hats off to him and I will be looking to read other books by him. The photograph of the author is very familiar to me. I feel that I may have known him. Strange."
2,Very disappointed,"This book had it's moments, but overall it was slow. There was just to much of Peter and his new girlfriend's son that didn't add much to the story. Also, the ending just made me go ""what?""I was VERY disappointed in the end. There was a great build up to the mystery, however nada was ever fully explained. None of the questions are really answered. I really wanted to know what happened to his ex-wife & son. How did they disappear??? I was just disappointed w/ this book & after the ending I donated book to local library.The storyline w/ Pomeroy was the most interesting. He was a great character, however, we never learned about the Linda he mentioned. Someone he stalked before????If you want to read this book go to your local library."

2,Dorothy L. Sayers must be rolling in her grave,"It may be true that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, but if this is so, then David Roberts attempts to flatter Dorothy L. Sayers in much too obvious a way. Roberts' character Lord Edward Corinth is a pale (no pun intended) imitation of Sayers' wonderful Lord Peter Wimsey, right down to the aquiline nose and the habit of getting information by acting like a befuddled upper class twit. Verity Browne is a sort of Harriet Wimsey taken to the nth degree -- grating and unsympathetic, without any of Harriet's softer side. This novel has lots of fun 1930s detail and some decent plot twists, but for anyone who loves the Lord Peter books, it's painful to read."
3,Christmas Gift For Son,This is probably an unfair rating as I purchased this book as a Christmas gift for my son. The outward cover is in excellent condition.
3,"Kind of Lame, but Has Its Place","This is very affordable software. That's one of its main selling points--so if you're on a budget this is a great option. And it's good for learning vocabulary. It's lame in a way: you're not really going to learn how to *speak* Spanish using it, but you'll pick up a lot of words and become better able to read signs and things. You won't learn Spanish well enough to impress the attractive woman on the box (why do they have all those Spanish/Hispanic stereotypes on the cover art, anyway?), but it's a start."
1,I was very disappointed with this one.,Don't buy this product expecting to fully learn the Spanish language. It will teach you a few words and phrases but that's it. It contains nothing about grammar or how to pronounce the letters and one cannot fully understand a language without first learning that. I feel that this CD-ROM was a complete waste of money and I would not recommend it to anyone who wants to truly learn the Spanish language.
1,Stunned at its distribution.,"I have this software as well as several other language learning titles from the same company. They were everywhere, bookstores, Costco, Amazon, you name it. Somewhere in my mind I associated that great distribution with quality and bought the whole lot together when I found them on sale.Firstly, the software is poorly written and causes a lot of problems with new computers and newer versions of Windows. The audio and visual programs are strangely poor considering there are so many inexpensive options out there.The content is also very thin but that fact is well hidden by confusing interfaces. Navigating this software is not easy. Once you do get it down, however, there's no reward - minimal vocabulary, incomprehensible dialogues without adequate translation/explanation, no overview of cultural idioms (which explains why the dictionairy is useless). The problmes go on.I feel pretty stupid for having purchased it."
3,Unless you need to OWN every Spanish CD out there....,"Skip this one. Cool games. Not that great. There are some 4 CD sets that rock! Really go thru the basics and then progress into the harder stuff. This set is kinda like a game, it's alright. Not worth the cash. I was on a quest to own every Spanish CD made... this one I could have skipped and been just fine. Not a bad product itself... there's just many choices and many better choices then this one."
2,Disappointing,"I was extremely disappointed with this product. The first disc teaches only a few nouns. It contains almost no verbs, adverbs, pronouns, adjectives, etc. The second disc is nothing but dialouge that is all in Spanish with no English translations. The people talk way too fast for a beginner, and there's no way to slow the speed of the dialouge. I complained to the company about this and they basically told me that I was wrong for not liking their product. Also, the five language dictionary isn't very good either. I typed in an English word and it gave about fifty different Spanish words for that one word. So I absolutely do not recommend purchasing this CD-ROM."
3,Unbiased opinion - this package is a tease,The software seems ok to give you a bite of spanish but I'm disappointed to say I wanted alot more. I've already mastered the audio cd's in 2.5 weeks and I need more and hoped for alot more. Does anyone recommend something that will teach spanish well on audio for the money ?
4,great live cd,"only thing i didnt like is the fact that ""put your hands up for detroit"" lyrics are changed. does bbb do that with every city he visits??the cd is well put together and the track selection is great.def worth the buy."
1,Are you kidding me?,"I'm not sure where the previous reviews are coming from. And don't think that I mistakenly picked up a Bad Boy Bill release without knowing who he is. I became aware of Bad Boy Bill waaayyyy back during his Bangin The Box 1 cd. However, he has never seemed to progress with the trends of electronic house music. Perhaps he is just ""keepin' it real"" since his music sounds very similar to what it did way back then.I find it annoying and very non enjoyable. This is not House Music."
1,slow service will never order again,was told to be shipped september 1st now september 8th my daughter already started school aug 30 slow service
1,Rockymountaintextbooks was less than peak,"This book was in extremely bad condition and took a very long time. This ""Rocky"" has been knocked out!"
3,Math book,"The shipper described the item well. It was not in good condition, but better than I had expected. It was very inexpensive only about $2.00 plus shipping. I think the shipper was very fair with his price, and it was delivered quickly. I would use him/her again."
1,Seems to have design flaw...,"First radio ordered had bad contact in battery compartment. It worked a few weeks and quit. I thought it needed new batteries. It needed a new radio, which Amazon graciously provided free of charge as a replacement. It, too, had the same flaw. I couldn't get it to run at all. Too bad, as it was just what I wanted for listening to the news when I walk the dog."
4,RELLY COOL!!,"The Saddle Club (plus Veronica diAnglo) are going to California for a pony club ralley. The meet up with Sky Ramson, the movie-star friend. He is having trouble on the set. Can the Saddle Club help? Also, a very dumb driver is supposed to take their horses to Richmond, then another driver picks them up. Or does he?"
2,weak fragrance,"Although the item arrived in a timely fashion, it smells like it's been sitting on the shelf for too long. Not at all like the fragrance I have ordered dirictly from Lauren. Not worth the savings."
5,An underappreciated gem,"I was listening to Dwight Yoakam one day and then, without giving it a lot of thought, I put Mike Ireland on the changer. And it struck me pretty quickly: this is better than Dwight! In my book. that's a big deal.Though the voice is similar, Mike Ireland isn't as catchy as Dwight, and things are more stripped down. (Even the string arrangements have a spare sound to them.) But there's a real plainspoken intelligence in the writing and the melodies have a way of working on you. Listen to ""House of Secrets"" a few times; you'll see what I mean.According to a piece I read recently in _No Depression_, this CD has only sold around 2500 copies so far. That's a flat-out shame, not least for you. But with a click and a credit card number, you can help turn that around."
2,This Dog Wont Hunt,"What am I missing here? OK, Mike has a sweet enough voice, but to be valid, roots/alt country music has to have some edge to it. This CD is sandpaper smooth with nothing but slick rounded corners. And with a name like ""Holler,"" the backup group is guilty of monumental misrepresentation. Comparing this guy with Dwight Yokum -- as does one of the Amazon editorial reviewers --would be just plain laughable if it weren't such a travesty. Dwight should sue for slander. The melodies here are mostly jingles and the lyrics mostly lame. I got this CD used and cheap -- and feel cheated nonetheless."
1,Not the same quality,"I agree with JK316! I've bought Sakura's refill pack of 70 from Dick Blick and they aren't the gummy efficient ones that were prepackaged in the box with the electric eraser. These refill erasers are cheap, hard and they wear out super fast while creating a mess of eraser crumbs everywhere. I wish the company would hear this one out."
2,Eraser composition has changed!,The new erasers are not as efficient before. Why change such a great product and charge the same amount of money? The new eraser is gummy and gray and leaves residue of the paper. Typically it is about 1/3 as efficient. I understand companies are trying to save money and cutting corners but this is just bad business. I work for Robert Longo and I'm not sure if these can cut it anymore. Its very frustrating that consumers pay the same amount but the product changes for the worse.
5,Plenty of Refills,There are a lot of refills in this box. For the price....you are getting a bargain!
4,"unquestionable ""deluxe""","This Cd is definetely one of the best german hip hop cd's ever with tight beats crazy rhymes and cool flows. But most of the lyrics are just the usual battle rhyme stuff and the whole cd is about how great Samy thinks he is. He is great, he proofs it once more but he could have been a bit more original with his topics. For most of the customers, i think yhis is a good way to get into german hip-hop"
1,This product is worthless!,This product is worthless!The bag has no depth so it's difficult to get the insulin bottle in the sleeve along with the freezer pack. The freezer pack has no staying power because the the wallet is open at the sides.
5,"Nice compact size, keeps cool, can be used for makeup or snacks too","I don't have diabetes but I used this to travel with some of my supplements that need to be kept cold.It's a perfect compact little size, not too small and not too big, and it really did keep my things cool during a long trip recently. Plenty of room for several vials and extra little pouches for needles if needed.A person could even use it to carry other things while traveling, like cosmetics that are subject to melting, or small snacks on a flight, like cheese slices or a thin sandwich."
1,Not very good,"I have enjoyed other books by this author, but this one was not worth the time to read it. The dialog was simplistic and unrealistic. The characters were not likeable or believable. It read like something written by a not very good amateur. If I wasn't already a fan of Mary Lynn Baxter, I would definitely avoid other books by her."
5,Very effective,I really like this product and think it has made my airplants a lot heathier. I have 8 Tillandsia's and I use a capful of this product diluted in the water to nurish my plants. It works becuase a few of them blosessomed in a cube way away form the windows - they still get some indirect office sunlight.
3,"helpful, but not completely","the book gives overviews of everything on the LSAT, that's true. but, it seems, esp. with the logic and the analytical reasoning games, it needs more in-depth information. it's probably on par with most of the available study guides."
2,Not as great as i wished it to be,"This is a great book to use for discussions with pre-teens and older. But instead of remaining objective at the end of the book, the author chooses to have a zero population slant.I have 8 well educated children who are an asset to the world...and they will be in the future. The book is wonderful until it begins to speak on population control. This is NOT a given. There are many who believe the way to overcome or end some of the worst problems this world faces, is to EDUCATE, and not only with knowledge but with compassion. When we teach children to be compassionate and teach them to THINK we will have generations who will change the problems in the world."
3,If the world were a village,"I thought from the descriptiopn that the book would be suitable for a third grader but, having read it, I think the mathematical and sociological level of the reader should be closer to 8 /th grade. But, then, I'm not a teacher so I may be way off!"
2,Facts Dulled By Unimaginative Presentation,"This may be a five-star concept, but the execution leaves much to be desired, particularly in the illustrations. The best that can be said is that the pictures are deeply colored and might make a good stained-glass project. However, the almost uniformly bird's-eye view of this ""global village"" fails to show much difference between the haves and have-nots, or, really, to illustrate the facts of any given page. We simply see a colorful village from the air... over and over. The very imagery that might make these facts come alive in a child's imagination is missing. Some sense of interaction - this is a village, after all! - would help. Instead of faces, we are given a fly-over. Thus, the facts remain mere lists, and not emotionally compelling."
5,Great classroom resource,"This is such a great teaching resource for grades K all the way up to 12! Imagining the world as a village of 100 people allows younger ones a better understanding of dry statistics. And the learning possibilities with older students are endless. Highly recommend this and the companion title, If America Were a Village: A Book about the People of the United States for educators to use in the classroom."
5,Read this With a Child Again and Again!,"Both thoughtful and equally stimulating, ""If The World Were a Village"" succeeds in opening the eyes and the minds of young readers through a quite creative format. As a father of two children, the book offers several topical ""lenses"" to discuss and really share in the wonderful effort to better understand some of these very timely and also profound issues so relevant for each and everyone of us. If the mark of a good book is to provoke our thinking on a topic and engage our minds - adult and child - you've got the perfect thing right here."
2,a disappointment,"This is a great idea for a book, but it really is not well written. The text is very dry. I agree with the other reviewer that the concepts are too difficult for the given age range (ages 4-8). But the biggest disappointment was the lack of imagination by the illustrator. While the artwork is colorful and creative, the pictures do not help to get the concepts across to the reader. They just seem to fill up space to make the book long enough to be worth publishing. Check the book out from the library, because it has interesting information, but it is not worth owning."
2,written by a statistician?,"A lovely idea for a children's story book but the ""stories"" aremissing.The book presents statistics!!of populations of the worldThe opportunity to delight and for enlightenment is missed.There is nothing here to capture the imagination of our 4 year olds!We have an international family - thought this would be a lovely andrelevant book - but, such a disappointment!If the World Were a Village - Second Edition: A Book about the World’s People (CitizenKid)"
4,Good Movie,Good Movie ....Yul was so young when that movie was made. Good Movie ....Yul was so young when that movie was made
4,Yul Brynner in a Native American Indian role,"Kings of the SunI saw this movie for the first time about 40 years ago and it is one that stands out in my memory. Yul Brynner plays an Indian and his characterization is well done. The music for the film was done by Elmer Bernstein. If you like Yul Brynner, you will enjoy this movie."
3,Hints or Mayan History,"A Hollywood grade B type movies. Very few changes in set or location. Focus is on the actors. Shallow story. Typical Yul Brynner strutting around near naked, showing his muscular body and famous shaved head. Entertaining as a grade B movie. Not very realistic and not historically accurate. Main theme of pros and cons of human sacrifice hinted at but not explained or resolved."
3,Kings Of The Sun,A good film and Very good transfer both sound and picture. Bought it for my collection.
1,Wouldn't Upload After Being Charged For Rental:,Seems that there has been a problem with uploading this flick.It wasn't due to any problems with my Kindle Fire or my WiFiEspecially since I could upload other movies without any issues.Amazon made the extra profit because it took three rental taps for this one movie to finally upload the third timeso I could finally watch Kings Of The Sun..............
1,Watch those reviews!,"I read all the reviews and this sounded like a great movie. I like old movies, this isn't one of them. I've seen some stupid shows and this one certainly fits into that catagory.Kings of the Sun"
2,Small print-overpriced,"Although this is a really classy company who honors their return policy perfectly, this particular product is way overpriced.[...] We expected a larger book with normal 12 pt font, but this is a pocket sized book with 10 pt or less print size.[...]This was shipped from Germany. I will read the description closer next time.The quality of the dictionary itself was Very Good and the condition was like new."
2,Arena Football should be leashed,"I am a fan of Arena Football. I enjoy watching it because it is exciting, but this game doesn't live up to the real game. The game is very similiar to NFL Blitz except NFL Blitz is better. What makes Unleashed worse is there is less teams to pick from and all you do is pass. The most action comes after the play is over when players jump on each other and beat each other up. If you are thinking of buying this game, rent it first to see if it is really worth the money."
4,What a Game!,"Although I was a bit pessimstic when I first bought this game, it turned out to be one of the best football video games that I have ever played. The hitting is absolutely hard core and I love the fast paced nature of the game. It looks as if it was patterned after NFL Blitz but it is a lot better than Blitz ever dreamed about being. As a real life Arena Football fan, this totally satisfies my thirst."
3,"Basically, it is NFL Blitz but not as good","I love NFL Blitz and this game is basically the same thing with AFL teams and slight variations based on AFL rules. Unfortunately, it doesn't play as fast as Blitz and the graphics are not as good. Still, if you like NFL Blitz and Arena Football, then this is your game. If you are looking for something more realistic to Arena Football, you will have to wait until EA sports does something like the Madden games for AFL."
5,One of the best football games out there!,"As an Arena Football fan myself, this is everything you could ask for! It has all of the rules (except this is hardcore), It has most of the players, all of the teams, this is just one great game!"
4,Warning for M100 owners!,"Although this keyboard shows up in the search list for Palm M100s, Palm insists that the curved shape of the M100's bottom is not compatible with standard III keyboards, folding or otherwise."
2,More fantasy than science fiction,"As another reviewer wrote, with little exception these are not stories with depth. Furthermore, science fiction is in the minority in this collection. If you like lightweight fantasy that's easy to read, then go ahead and spend a buck. If you're looking for real science fiction, search elsewhere."
3,Right Angle might not be the right solution,"If you listen to music on the go mostly on your MP3 or cellphone, then right angle is not so go. For a laptop it works like a charm. The main problem with this product is that it is too loose and very easy for it to simple unplug itself for the audio jack. It is a pain to have to replug every now and then and have to unlock phone and hit play again to continue listening to music. Buy the sennheiser adapter instead."
2,Not as good as the Grado's,"Get the Grado's they are better. I have both, in a A-B test you can tell the Grado is a better sound."
4,Company is great to work with!,"Ordered the adapter, had a minor issue, contacted STSI and got a very quick response which solved the issue. Thank you Marie S. and STSI for being great to do business with!"
1,Only worked for a few months,"Worked from a few months, would intermittently cut out, then went totally dead. The housing is too thick to cut into and repair the wiring."
3,"Works well, with a caveat.",It works well with mySennheiser HD555 Professional Headphones with Sound Channelingand my laptop's headphone input socket. however the 1/8th inch is a bit too narrow? not sure what's the word for it. but it easily slides out from the audio jack on my laptop. and sometimes it'd slip out without me intending to.
4,"Nice product, get the Grado...!","I have both this and the Grado 1/8 inch adapter which goes from 1/4. It's pretty simple, the Grado has a much better build quality. The Hosa works most of the time but usually once per use a channel will drop out and I'll have to fiddle with the 1/4 female connection to get both channels working. Definitely not good if you plan on moving at all while wearing a headphone. Get the Grado, it's worth the few extra bucks!"
5,"Shipped Fast, is what it says it is.",Not much to say here except that this is a decent price for what it is. It does what it is supposed to do.
1,Not what it claims to be.,Am I crazy or is this product the exact opposite of what it claims to be? It is called a RIGHT ANGLE 1/4 to 3.5 mm. It is actually a RIGHT ANGLE 3.5mm to a STRAIGHT 1/4 isn't it? That is a big difference. It does not matter if you just want to convert from 1/4 to 3.5mm. There are many products that can do that but what if you really need a RIGHT ANGLE 1/4 male plug which it claims to be? My receiver is hidden in a cabinet and there is no room for a straight 1/4 inch plug to go into the 1/4 inch headphone jack for me to attach a wireless headphone transmitter when the door is closed. The wireless transmitter has a male 3.5 plug which would plug perfectly into the 3.5 jack on this product if the product was what it claims to be. Does anyone know where I can buy what this product claims to be?
4,Be A One Of The Destiny Divas!,"This Is An Awesome CD For All Of The Hardcore DC Fans! I Think It Was Awesome...... Learn The Words Sing Along... And Have Fun! If Your Someone Who Loves To Perform For Other People Get This CD To Help You! Good Quality, Good Group, Good Fun!!!!"
1,Problem with the top,"After only a couple years of using this grinder, the metal tubes that connect the body of the mill to the circular mechanism at the top began to fall out. It became very frustrating to use, because as I ground pepper, a metal tube would fall out and land in my food. I finally gave up and bought a new mill. Very poor design for such an expensive pepper mill."
4,"Great images, not so great care information","The directory of color varieties is excellent, with large high-quality pictures few other books can match-- but this book only contains the very basics of actual koi care. I lost half of my fish in a matter of hours to a Ph crash-- a phenomenon this book never mentions. I only figured out what had actually happened a couple of years later, while reading the Koi Health & Disease book."
4,cute toy,"I bought this for my 2 year old daughter but my 3 year daughter started using it to give her polly pocket's and littlest petshop pets rides on it, they spin around and around as she pulls it. The rollarounds are neat too. My 2 year old (just turned 2) doesn't play with it much but it's a cute toy."
2,Neat but not perfect...,"This toy is a wonderful addition to the roll a round line, which up until this point consisted solely of a dinosaur, a gumball machine and a turtle, so it was certainly a welcome addition. The rounds that come with the toy are very cute, but not as as related to the toy as they normally are. For instance, the gumball machibe comes with candy themed balls. Still, the rounds are alwasy cute. As for the toy itself, it is very very cute. It is easy to pull or push or drag, and moves around quite easily. The only issue I have with it how easily the balls fall out, whcih frustrates my child, and i also believe that the pull string should be a bit easier to hold. all in all, a great toy"
4,cool toy,"This is a very cute toy. When it is pulled it's eyes and ears move up and down. My [...] only might like it more than my [...] The balls fall out to easy though. When it hits a turn the balls usually fly out, and I don't like that. When I bought it, it looked like there were plactic covers that went over the balls. It turned out they were not part of the toy, but it would be a good idea. We have a huge collection of the roll-a-round balls and peek-a-blocks. They are really neat toys."
2,Uninspired...,"This toy is a bit silly. My daughter likes to roll the balls on the floor, but it isn't nearly as much fun as some other pull-toys she has. The balls immediately fall off the caterpillar when a child pulls it, and it isn't heavy enough to even stay upright.It just sits on the toyshelf, looking cheesy.I'd recommend investing in a quality wooden pull-toy, instead.The only great things about it is that they didn't try to jazz it up with annoying flashing lights or terrible music! For that reason alone, we didn't return it."
2,Flawed Roll Arounds Toy,"I normally love all the roll arounds toys and would recommend them, but this one has some problems. It is too light so doesn't stay upright if a child pulls it unless they are walking very, very slowly, and most kids I know never do that. The balls also fall off it when it is pulled. I frankly wouldn't buy this and would invest in a different pull toy. My kids love to roll the balls around on the floor or use them with other roll arounds toys but ignore the caterpillar itself."
5,Snakes are never scary when you have Cam Jansen around...,"You have to love Cam Jansen. When you're a kid, you read all of these stories about magic powers, mystery, and adventure. But everyone tells you magic can't exist. Cam Jansen manages to solve every case without the use of magic... she's a real girl. That's what makes her special and what makes you want to read more and more. Cam Jansen is a real kid superhero, and the thought that a person like her could actually exist... makes her the best kid detective ever! Our family loves Cam Jansen!"
3,I wonder if its complete,"Both the German & the Dutch version of this work are much longer and stretch about 850 pages. This one is only 600 pages long, so I wonder where the other 250 are.Apart from that its one of the most important books I think there ever have been published by any Sociologist. On of the few that really stands on par with Weber, Durkheim & Habermas (if you concider him as a sociologist).I really want to read the rest also."
5,Well suited for teenagers with an interest in horses,"Written in straightforward, easy-to-follow language, Cheryl Kimball's The Everything Horse Book is an exhaustive, ""user friendly"" guide to caring for and riding a horse. From equine behavioral problems, to nutrition and grooming, to tack and accessories, The Everything Horse Book introduces the lay reader to a wide range of fascinating and practical information. The Everything Horse Book is an excellent and recommended guide for adults, which is also accessible enough to be very well suited for teenagers with an interest in learning about and caring for horses."
4,Very good guide for caring for a horse,"This is a good book for the person who doesn't own a horse yet but would like to sometime. It is very complete, going over stuff from hoof anatomy to how to introduce your horse to an electric fence for the first time. However, I think that Horses for Dummies by Audrey Pavia is even MORE complete and I liked that better, but overall this is a very, very good book."
3,it's ok...,"When i first got this book i thought it was going to be much better. I thoroughly enjoyed it however. I am 14 years old and when i passed it down to my younger sister (who is 10) to read, she got bored really easily with it. It might be because she is just the type of person who bores easily, but there really is no motavation for someone of her age. there are very little pictures and is not written in a way which younger people understand"
5,good sprayer,Bought the Solo sprayer to apply stain to a cedar privacy fence. It worked flawlessly and made the task rather enjoyable.
2,short pickup tube,"seems like a nice sprayer, but i could not believe the pickup tube is 2 inches from the bottom. we could not find in the instructions how many pumps or when to stop pumping. Pales in comparison to the stainless water fire extinguisher we've been using as a sprayer."
1,Weak,"This product is ok if your not touching the mic at all, its very cheap plastic and u get what u pay for"
3,Poor Advertising,"I Bought this on March 17,2012My Intention was to attach it to a 19'' Goose Neck with a 5/8 inch thread.Bad thing was when it arrived, it was Just in a Small opened Plastic bag (No label or brand name).To My surprise it actually seem to be a 3/8 female Hole threading.The Item is Very Cheaply Constructed, Its like a Bag Clip with a Very Thin Spring Inside.The Price I paid was $5.22, from looking a it I actually I think this is Worth much less, since the Gripping power of the Clip is Not very Strong....and the Plastic is very thin. I doubt this item will last long if it actually fell to the Ground.So Now I have to Go look for a 3/8"" Female to 5/8"" Adapter for it to work.I really wish that Amazon make it compulsory for Sellers (on there site)to Put a Proper description of there Products (specification etc) so that buyers like myself would not have to go through the inconvenience that I have gone thru."
2,Too cheap for its own good,"As other reviewers have stated: sometimes it's just too cheap to be worth it at all. This is an unbelievably poorly designed product -- sure, it looks great, it plays MP3s, it connects to your computer, fine. But the controls are so annoying (basics, like turning it on and getting it to play your songs is a study in frustration). The little toggle control on the side of it simply too flimsy to be at the center of all operations -- half the time you end up jiggling it by mistake and find yourself recording a .wav when you thought you were about to play a song. Spend a little more, get something that doesn't lack the most rudimentary user friendlyness."
4,Very good for the price,I just got my Macvision Mp3 player yesterday it took me about two seconds to load it with my fist music you don't even need to load the software. I read all the other reviews where people said that they could not get it to work but I had no problems what so ever. This player is great I have no complaints for the price. I would recommend it for any one who wants a cheap player for working out or road trips. It not only sounds great but looks good as well.
4,great gift,"I bought the MP3 player for my son. He enjoys it, and had little trouble figuring out how to use it. I must say, I was impressed with the quality of sound it produces. I recommend this player. I can't say how long it will hold up with a teenager? This is a good entry level player."
1,Macvision MA833A,This player is not user friendly and is difficult to program.There are better players on the market.
5,Days gone By,"When I was in high School in the 50's we had a club house with a juke box in it. We had a Keg on the weekend and danced through the nite to this music. It's so great to hear it again,now if I could only find that time machine."
3,"good looking bag but not 9""","This bag is not 9"" in diameter, apparently they meant 9"" wide when FLATTENED.When fully stuffed, it's only 5.5"" in diameter, and does not fit my 1/4"" mat. It's a shame cuz the look and feel is very nice."
2,too small for standard yoga mats,"I purchased this yoga bag for my black manduka yoga matt, it was too small, about three inches too short. I tried it on another yoga matt, same problem. I had to return it. don' t buy this matt unless you have a gaiam brand matt. I assume their own brand of matt should fit. my manduka matt is 26"" x 71""."
4,Leather Cimarron Western Pleasure Saddle,"My 9 year old daughter got this for Christmas and just loves it. She is able to use it on her 1:9 scale Breyer horses with relative ease. I was a little concerned with how well it would hold up during play, since some Breyer things are made more for looking at than playing with, but it seems to be fairly well constructed. I'm not sure how well it would hold up to excessive handling, but for the occasional putting on or taking off of various horses it seems to be holding up fine."
5,"The best introduction to the wonderful, horrible nation.","Greg's book is perhaps the most important book on the history and culture of a people which a thousands of books have been written about. One can not understand Hitler without understanding what happened in the thousand years before him.One can not understand blind obediance to the murder of six million people without understanding the fundamental basics of German society, which are so often ignored."
1,You get what you pay for,"This is the worst product I have wasted money on yet. Most of the program had errors. You had better know a little about computers WHEN you want to remove it. The format is sub-par. The extra disks are fairly worthless. DO NOT WASTE your money. GO with the Pimsleur or living language courses. This one is not only a joke, but it will put you off from learning Litaliano. I dont write reviews, but this product angered me so much I had too. Too bad there is not a 0 star."
1,"Horrible, please don't buy","Ok I'll make it short and clear: DO NOT BUY IT.It's a waste of time and money.it doesn't have a continuos course, and they don't teach you usefull sentenses.I'm still looking for a good software, but this I know, this one sucks very muchOh and the dictionary is terrible too, 'cause when u wanna know how u pronounce a word in italian, it says that this feature is only available in english. But I already know how to pronounce in english, it's the italian I'm learnin.And it doesn't even help you build phrases."
1,Words cannot describe my digust towards this awful product,"It is advertised that the method of learning a language through this program is the way you learned as a child. I don't like I learned English from watching game shows. The first is fine but the second is, uhh, I don't know what to call it. It didn't teach a thing. I had to do some studying on the side to use it. I still didn't learn a thing. The second disk repeats the first disk's information in a more complicated fashion! I recommend purchasing one the old Berlitz books for learning Italian or any other language for that matter."
4,Learning Italian,"This product is ideal for someone that wants to potentially go to Italy and not cause an internation incident by offending the entire country or, more likely, impress a date at a local restaurant. The interactive format helps you retain a lot of words and phrases in a short period of time. I would recommend it to anyone that thinks Italian is a beautiful language but doesn't have the time to learn it. It can be done!"
5,What kind of camera is that?,"""What kind of camera is that?"" is the first thing everyone says to me when they see this camera. This is the only camera I have had that people immediately write down the model number to go get one for themselves. You can see from other reviews, the owners of this machine are smart people who have done their research. I have now sold several photos taken with this camera.It's lighter than it looks, it handles like my 35mm, it is easy to use right away and as I get better with it the images are getting better and better. We all send pics via email. The response is usually ""cool pic"" or similar. Now it is ""wow! what a great shot!""The battery life is the best I have ever had. I can fill a 256mb card and the battery meter still shows full charge.The bad? It won't fit in my pocket."
4,A pretty good camera,"I bought this camera back in May of 2004, and I have not had any problems since. One thing I have learned is that mega pixels are not everything. I bought my father a 4MP minolta S414 and the pictures are not as sharp as my camera. I think that has something to do with the lense. The long zoom is very nice. Up until today I never printed out a picture bigger than 8X10 Today I paid for a picture to be blown up to 16X20 and it looks pretty darn good. Certain things like the hand grip and resolution could be improved (and they have been with the newer models) I was thinking of replacing this camera with something like the FZ20, FZ30 or the new 8MP samsung with the 3.5"" screen. However after seeing how nice my 16X20 blow up turned out to be, I think I will keep it for a while."
5,I loved this book!,"I've been a fan of Janelle Taylor for many years, and I've really enjoyed her Historical romances. She's written a slew of them, and lucky us, they're all still available! But who knew her contemporaries are equally as wonderful? Valley of Fire is a compelling read with a sympathetic heroine and a yummy hero to die for. There's clever dialogue and sexy, emotion-drenched scenes. I was completely drawn into the story and couldn't put it down. The same wonderful writing that brings Ms. Taylor's Historicals to life brings her contemporaries to life as well. Try this one; you can't miss."
1,didn't even finish reading,"I used to love Janelle Taylor's books. I would buy each one as soon as it came out and read it in just a few days. I was happy to see one I never read available for free for my kindle and was in the mood for a romanace. If I remember correctly, it was one of her early works, rereleased. they shouldn't have bothered. It was horrible. It starts out with too many pages of the woman's thoughts and her life, then she is passed out and stranded on a road in the middle of nowhere. A man on a bike comes up and the reader gets even more pages of his thinking...again way too many! I never even got to the part where she wakes up and they begin talking. Whatever they would say to each other I already knew, because I had read their thoughts. The meeting was a contrived cliche and I didn't care about either of the characters. I love reading, and it's hard for me to not finish a book once I have started it, but I had no problem deleting it from my kindle."
3,Great until it quit working.,"I have owned this mill for several years and had been pleased with it's performance until it suddenly quit working. Now I can turn & turn the grinder but the salt does not grind up & fall out. I know that Peugeot has a good reputation so I plan to buy another & give them a second chance, hoping that my experience was a fluke."
5,It's wonderful to find a book that you read and enjoy purely for the story being told,"Diane seems a bit out of her time, but in a good way. The book smacks of the Victorian gothics and lives up to their page-turning potential. I coincidentally readThe Shadow of the Windimmediately after this book and I was amazed at how the same theme with a surprisingly similar result could have such a different, if equally engaging, feel."
3,"liked, not loved","This is a fabulous writer who has an amazing facility of the english language. This was an intriquing novel and offered a good discussion for book clubs. It was slow at first, but then it was quite easy to get swept away into the mystery."
4,Nice Surprises,"This was a strange book for me. When I was reading it, I couldn't put it down. But when I stepped away, I wasn't compelled to pick it back up. Because I do read quite often, I still finished it very quickly. I just found the paradox interesting.I found myself relating to Margaret with respect to her love of books. Even now, I can find myself staying up until 3am on a work night reading a book. What's a little sleep compared to a great book?Because I do read so much, I tend to see a lot of story lines coming.This story was nice because I couldn't even begin to imagine where things were going. And I loved that!"
1,borrrrrrrring!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I couldn't have been more bored throughout the entire novel. It took me over 2 weeks to finish! The only reason why I finished it was self discipline. Thank goodness it was only a borrowed book. What a waste of money that would have been otherwise! Sorry Diane. Better luck next time.
1,Kindle book costs more than paperback,I will not pay more for a kindle book tnan the paperback is selling for. I will get it from the library.
1,the thirteenth tale,This book could have been written by anyone. If you like V.C. Andrews style fiction then this book is for you. The story was stupid and I only wish that I had read some of these reviews before wasting my money and time. Life's too short for poorly written bad stories.
1,Unclean! Unclean! This book will give you leprosy . . .,". . . Leprosy of the spirit, that is.This review is for people who still care about what they put into their minds and hearts; all others may skip it.I was intrigued by this book's story line. In my innocence, I didn't realize that such shocking horror awaited me in the pages of what looked to be a very promising story. It started out so beautifully, but abruptly altered.The author has turned her talent and lovely writing style to filth and depravity. I could not read beyond the first seventy or so pages. I returned the book to Amazon.I do not understand why anyone would write such awful things. I also do not understand why anyone would publish it or want to read it."
3,Intriguing!,"This intricate and mysterious story is told by the master story-teller, Vida Winter, to Margaret Lea, who is book smart and no stranger to research, as an aging Vida Winter decides it's time to tell her tale.While this is not a quick read, the beautiful writing takes the reader to mansions in ruins, shocking truths and characters you will not soon forget. Just when it gets too dark and the ruin of a family seems imminent, the story twists with enough surprising interest to keep the reader moving and guessing."
1,bored me,"Way not a fan of the ending. The only reason I bought it was because it was recommended to me by Amazon, after reading ""the shadow of the wind."" Don't waste your money on this crap, it was torture turning the pags because it was so obvious what was going to happen next."
3,Too much fluff,I read this after reading all the great reviews on Amazon and found myself disappointed. Entirely too much unneccessary detail that didnt progress the story one iota. Found myself reading half a page at times wondering what the heck is she trying to convey and why. Descent enough story underneath.
3,Boring!,I am ploughing my way through this book. After reading the reviews I thought this would be a book I would like as I love Victorian novels. I find the over worked description is irritating and the plot line and characters uninteresting. As an airport novel it's OK. I'm sorry I wasted my money!
3,"Ok, not sensational",The story was very interesting and could have been so much more. It lacked that extra little push to make it totally scandalous like it should have been. It was certainly a page-turner yet a let-down at the same time.
2,A near miss...,"I am not surprised by the many positive reviews, for the prose is artful, the plot seductively twisted, and the characters vividly drawn. But for me, the plot unfolds too slowly, the underlying themes of abuse and mental illness too melancholy, and the characters too bizarre to relate to. Although it held my interest to the end, this book doesn't make my top ten list for 2006 and is grossly over-hyped."
4,Loved it so much I read it twice,"Beautifully and elegantly written. A mystery you can't put down. After I learned the ending, I started from the beginning and read it all over again. Gave this book to every reader I know for a Christmas gift. I listened to it on CD as well and the reading is magnificent."
5,Dessert,"Our book group generally reads a more serious genre, leaning toward intellectual stimulation. The upshot for this novel? Lots of laughter and questions and lively discussion. Always a few that don't like this sort of reading but most of us welcomed this as a great dessert.Well written, involving, almost immediately interesting and clues hit you in the face and you never guess it for a minute. Everything comes full circle. C'mon. Don't be a book snob. Enjoy this for what it is. Go for it. It wasn't on the best seller list for nothing!"
2,Bored me to tears,"This book bored me to tears. The characters were flat and there was not enough intrigue to keep me interesred in their lives. In short, I stopped reading about 1/3 the way through because it was becoming more of a chore than a pleasure to read it. Don't get me wrong, the author's use of the English language is beautiful and I enjoyed reading her prose. What I did not enjoy was the story."
3,Maybe it's just me,"I didn't enjoy this book as may other's have. While reading the first half of it I was reminded of reading Rose Red, which was a little bizarre for my taste. The second half of the book got better but I certainly would not rate this high on my favorite book list. I was not left with the feeling of wanting more, I was more looking forward to starting my new book. I was hoping for more from this book than what I got out of it."
2,The power of marketing?,"I have nothing against Ms. Diane Setterfield.This book should get 5 stars for the writing, but 1 star for the plot.It is very slow. I managed to finish this book only because I was on vacation.At the beginning of the book, there is an introduction of a twin ofMargaret where Margaret finds out by accident. I thought Margaret'stwin sister shall play a role in the later part of the book. Yet thisisn't happening.It seems like most people like this book. Perhaps I am a minority.However, if this is a good ""mystery"" book, what do you say on any mysterybook by Michael Connelly, Robert Crais, and David Cray?Meanwhile, I did some research on this book and another title called""The Interpretation of Murder"". There was an article on Wall StreetJournal about these two books recently.Eventually, I found out marketing play an important role, i.e. themillion dollars auction, the promotion by local bookstores, etc.I wonder if it is the success of the marketing."
2,The good thing is the cover,I tried very hard to reach the final pages of this boring novel. The very good reviews published by other readers and the beautiful cover made me buy it and read it to to the end. But this was one of a slow and boring book. Better skip it and try another one.
4,The Thirteenth Tale,"Very well written book -- original and compelling story, characters and subplot. I loaned my 1st copy to friends and never got it back, so I bought a 2nd copy to read again!"
3,Interesting...,"I was really excited when I started this book. I loved the characters and the plot was very intriguing. The story unfolded well and I anxiously turned each page...until Ambrose appeared. Sorry but the twins plus one was a stretch for me and the ending was out of reach. Well written by an intelligent author, but I was disappointed in the end."
3,Gothic not romance,"I remember enjoying ""gothic romances"" when I was younger so I thought I would try this. It certainly has the elements of a gothic novel. Dark creepy house, mysterious characters,forbidden secrets, but there is no romance if that is what you are looking for. I listened to the book on cd, the readers' were excellent, adding so much to the atmosphere of the story. I almost never finish a book if I don't like the characters and the only sympathetic characters in this book were the minor ones. The heroine Margaret was whiny and detached. Therefore I felt detached from the characters. As some others have said, the last few chapters felt very rushed. It is worth reading or listening to but it won't go on my favorites list."
4,A book with a plot,I'm about halfway through listening to this book and Setterfield certainly knows how to hold on to the reader's attention. Haven't read a book like this in a long time and it is a nice change.
2,"well-written, but disturbing plot","I bought this book with much anticipation, after having heard so many good things about it. It is a well-written book. However, there are several themes that bothered me enough to make me stop reading - themes such as incest, abuse, and overall dysfunction. These things distracted and bothered me to the point of not being able to look past them and enjoy the wonderful language and atmosphere in the book. I feel the book would have been much better without the disturbing content."
1,disappointing,"This is a rare miss from Amazon reviews, I'm definitely in the minority. I finished it out of pure stubborness. Really not a likeable soul in the book. Incest, feral children, self-abuse, Mary Poppins (without the flying), the moors, a biddable maiden narrator, creaking manor homes, a ""ghost story"" without a ghost...just painful."
5,Great modern gotic novel,"I bought this at a second-hand book store last year. It took me a few chapters to get into the author's writing style; I didn't realize it was a French/English setting and literary tone. I am glad I continued reading, though. The story is about a famous dying author who calls on a young biographer to relive the long-buried stories of her haunting, troubled past. Once I got well into the story, I could not put this down. I became fully engrossed in all of the characters, all of the gripping plots and turns, even the sordid relationship between Isabella and Charlie. The end was a little anti-climatic for me though. But even with the hard-to-get-into beginning and being a bit disappointing in the end, what was in between was intense, intriguing, suspensful and page-turning enough for me to still give it 5 stars. This was a very good find, and many modern goth novelists could take some notes on this book."
5,Page Turner!,"Well written, interesting, page turner. It was one of our book club's favorite books in a LONG time."
4,The Thriteenth Tale,"I have certainly enjoyed this book, however, I have had to think occassionly to review each character as to who is who.It read like a mystery, which I loved,and as the book read on I found myself not wanting to put it down.Judy Bruch"
2,Disappointing,"The author tries WAY too hard to make this novel suspenseful and intriguing. Her prose is somewhat laughable, doesn't flow, and leaves a lot to be desired. The final twist in the book is so ridiculous it's not even funny. Big disappointment is all I can say."
2,the book club chose this one,"I didn't love this book, for me it was overwritten, over wrought and s l o w. I read it because my book club selected it."
2,Couldn't finish it,"Got 3/4 of the way through and just did not have it in me to finish. Basically, I didn't care what happened. Can't believe I kept reading as far as I did--guess I wanted to like it. Kept waiting for something really interesting to happen. It never really did. Two stars for the fact I did get 3/4 of the way through. Next time I will follow my 100-page rule. Life's too short!"
3,A Love Hate Relationship,"The book is overall very slow, in fact the majority of the time it is very slow. Of course it had some high points & enough to keep me interested...but for the most part i couldn't wait to finish to move on to something more interesting."
5,fabulous and different!,"Very well writen I thought. Loved the characters and the way that they looked at each others life. A ""story teller"" writing her own biography before she dies is interesting enough but when truth is better than fiction... gets interesting. Lots of twists and turns. Great read. Holds your interest quite well.Tammy in Tennessee"
4,Once You Get Into It....Delightful,"The book starts slow - the writing is a bit choppy, but then Setterfield gets into the flow of things, and the story starts to pick up. I really enjoyed it. As one of the reviewers on the back of the book said - this is a book for those who love reading. Us nerdy girls who spent our teenage years curled up in our rooms with Pride & Prejudice and the like. Or is it 'We nerdy girls???'"
5,WOW!,Talk about gifted writers...when is her next book coming out?! A breath of fresh air amongst the stale selection of novels proported to be best sellers. Diane Setterfield definitely sets the bar to new heights. Thank you for such an amazing story that will undoubtedly be enjoyed for generations to come!
5,Thrilling read!,"Oh what fun it is to read. Drama ,love dysfunction and charecters who make you root for them.406 or so pages I loved to read.My journey to find something as engaging and delightful begins again."
4,worthwhile,"This was a bit slow in the beginning. But I found the author to be very articulate, and the plot well thought out. It IS a bit of a mystery storyand well written"
3,"Good, not great.","This book suffers from two major issues - hype and length.The book is not near as good as many people claim (and certainly not in the same ballpark as Jane Eyre). It's well written and interesting, to be sure, but with all that has been said about it I was expecting something more out of the story.Which brings me to the second problem. Maybe if it'd been 100 pages shorter I would have liked it more. It just took too long to get to the end. Any regular story (that is, non-epic) more than 350 pages in length needs to justify itself. I don't think this book does that.It's better than most modern fiction I've read lately, but still not that great."
2,Slow and lumbering!,I read the great reviews and purchased the audio copy of this book. It was a great premise and could have been a great book but it was so slow and lumbering I had to make myself finish it because I had paid for it! The story itself was of interest but it could have been told in far less time.
3,Dissappointed in the end,This one came highly recommended so I was dissappointed that it wasn't more. I sruggled to get to the end as well but anticipated great closure and kept going. There were too many random possibilities that became the end of the story that didn't tie in at all.
2,Not on a par with all the hype ...,"I was sadly disappointed in this book. I all but sat at the store awaiting its arrival and I'm a huge fan of classic literature and love a great story. The first few pages held promise (reminding me a lot of Shadow of the Wind - which I absolutely loved). The hype about this book was huge, but the reality lackluster. The writing style and form is excellent, so no qualms there. The author just needs a better story to display her talents. The plot fizzles to the ridiculous with the ending being untenable, patchy and just, uh, downright silly. I just didn't buy it at all (won't divulge the ""spoiler""). I had a very hard time caring one iota for Vida Winter, she is just patently unlikeable (as are her parents). While conflict in a character is great, you have to at least care somewhat about them. I also found the main character rather ho hum. Overall, disappointing."
2,"Trite, Trite, Trite","All I could think from beginning to end was how incredibly trite the whole thing was. It's a fast airport read I guess, but I don't even know if I would recommend it for that. I suppose I wanted to know the outcome, but I figured out the ""twist"" long before it was revealed and it made finishing the book a chore. Super light reading."
2,Very Disappointing,"I ordered this book through Amazon because of the large number of 4-5 star reviews. Plus, the plot summary seemed interesting. However, I was very disappointed with this book.I had two major problems with The Thirteenth Tale: First, the entire book is ""overwritten"". It's a bit over 400 pages and I couldn't help thinking it could easily have been written in 250 pages. There is just too much fluff. For example, the author dedicates 3 whole pages to describing how a woman accidently sewed an extra heel in a pair of socks. To make matters worse, this had very little to do with the story. It could have been described in a paragraph. The second problem has to do with the ending. I don't want to spoil it for people who haven't read the book, so I'll just say it was a very far-fetched, hard-to-believe ending."
4,"A bit slow, but ultimately satisfying","It took me a few months to get through this book. It was slow in spots, and though the story was interesting, perhaps it didn't suck me in as much as I'd expected (or hoped) it would. I'm glad I stuck with it, though. Without giving too much away, there are some pretty huge twists in the last few pages that make the slow journey of getting to that point worthwhile. I found the ending to be satisfying (and, more importantly, plausible in the context of all that had come before).If you like fast-paced action, this is not the book for you. But if you can appreciate a story that unfolds slowly, then you just might enjoy The Thirteenth Tale."
3,Not so good,"The author had some really great ideas, some of the writing was very well done, but I'm sorry I thought the story was a bit vapid. I the characters, but didn't really feel connected with them. I felt like I was reading a book that would appear on Life Time on Saturday Afternoon."
4,A Page Turner,"This novel offered me just what I was looking for: beautifully written, engaging, great story, and rich. Though I feel the ending was a bit flat, I would highly recommend this book. It makes for a great read!!"
3,The Author Tried To Do Too Much,"This was my first ""summer read"", and I could hardly wait to get my hands on the book. Something about the description really appealed to me. It is an entertaining summer read. I liked the author's style of writing (language) and the way the author moved between the 2 characters' stories. My only complaint is that the author tried to throw in everything but the kitchen sink and it all came apart for me at the end. My disbelief could no longer be suspended. That being said, I did enjoy it enough that I finished it in two days."
5,What Succor,"I have a new favorite book. It is the Thirteenth Tale. Upon finishing, I immediately went to find another book by Diane Setterfield, the author. Imagine my disappointment and shock that this is her debut. Setterfield has it all! She can create a great plot. In this case, it is a mystery about the life of a star author. She creates great characters. Almost all of them are crazy in some way, and yet endearing. She makes you care about them. And she is a master word smith. Her language is beautiful and gothic. Just start at the beginning, in the antiquarian book shop that her father owns, and you will see what I mean. If the book affects you like it did me, you will swear you can even smell the dust on the books."
5,Return of the Gothic,"Diane Setterfield has written an old-fashioned gothic that immediately draws in the reader and keeps her spellbound. With its timeless quality, its intertwined family secrets, and, yes, even the cold rain of its fog-bound moors, The Thirteenth Tale kept me up well past midnight and served as a reminder of all the reasons I love reading.Very highly recommended."
4,A tale,"I will tell you a story about twins! I will tell you a ghost story!That's how Vida Winter starts his real story. The one she'll tell Margaret Lea, a biographer. The real story, the one all journalists have tried to extort from her without succeeding.I won't tell you more.Absorbing.This book is indescribably fascinating and it's going to haunt you till the end.Don't miss it!"
2,unsympathetic characters,"No thanks. This book is full of psychotic, inbred half-wits. The two main characters take themselves so seriously. Not a badly-written book--just unsympathetic characters. Not a one I liked.Emily Bronte could pull off these characters: I don't know how she did it but she did.There's no time structure in this book: I had no idea of dates and ages of the characters. I had no idea what style of dress to put them in in my head. I'd put 'em in Edwardian dress and then find out I should put them in flapper gear.If it's modern day, how come the main character still relies on basically quill pens and carrier pigeons? I didn't like this--at least address why she doesn't use cell phones and computers. If it isn't present day, I need to know this.Did not finish listening. Feh."
4,"A refreshing ""ghost"" story....","When I purchased this book, I purchased it with the intent of fulfilling my ghost/thriller/mystery craving for the fall months. I was pleasantly surprised by a refreshingly different ""ghost"" story. Plenty of twists and unexpected turns through the lives of the Angelfield residents as well as Margaret herself. The only downfall is that I think there could've been more of Margaret's story built in to the book. I wanted more interaction with her mother and more of HER twin story. But other then that, well written novel."
3,The Thirteenth Tale,"For me, this book started out strong. I really liked the character of Margaret, the biographer, and I was interested in how the story of the twins was going to lead back to Vida. However, I was really disappointed in the implausable, WTF?-type ending. Even though I didn't mind it as much, I think many readers would be turned off by the incestous and violent relationship between the parents of the twins. The author described Vida as an author of books so riveting you couldn't put them down. I wish this had been one of them."
3,"Fun read, disappointing ending...","A very fun read with colorful characters and mysterious plot - a great page turner for the first 90% of the book... and then I just felt as if the author grew tired of the mystery / suspense and just handed the ending to you on a fast food tray. I stayed up until one in the morning anxious and excited to finish the book and solve the mystery, but when I turned the last page I felt cheated. It just fell flat for me at the end."
4,Gorgeous prose,"You absolutely must love the written word to appreciate The Thirteenth Tale. The old woman's hands were a ""jumble of knuckles and rubies in her lap"" - can you see it? Yes, the book wanders and meanders at times. It is reminiscent of novels from the nineteenth century, when mood was everything; when a reader had time to immerse him/herself in a pool of language and atmosphere and just float awhile.I withheld a fifth star because, in my opinion, the ends were too neatly tied up, all the book-long agonies too quickly assuaged, all the wounds too successfully bandaged for the end to fulfill the promise spied in the first few chapters. But, to be fair, there really is no good way to end a good story.Overall, I think I would describe Ms. Setterfield's style as equal parts Charlotte Bronte and Joyce Carol Oates, with a bit of Ruth Rendell in there for good measure. I anxiously await her next novel."
5,The Thirteenth Tale,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It touched a lot of my reader's ""buttons"". How a great book lingers on and when you've reached the end, starting a new book - there is the lingering effect - makes it hard to shift gears into a possibly mediocre book - but such is the lot of us avid readers out there...."
1,Kindle price is higher than the actual book!,"I have only started reading this novel and am thus far enjoying it. I need to state though, how ridiculous it is that the Kindle version is $3 more than the paperback edition when the publisher expends little to no money in publishing the digital version. Amazon needs to be more aggressive with these greedy publishers!"
1,B.O.R.I.N.G.,I've been reading this book for what feels like an eternity! This book is incredibly boring and I honestly don't care at all about any of the characters. The only reason I continue reading it is because once I start a book I feel like I have to finish it. I'll be really glad when I finally finish this one!
2,Too far fetched.,"The description of this book was very inticing. It started out good, easy to follow with an interesting story. Two thirds into it the events became too improbable and the characters unbelievable. Overall it was an unhappy story, that made me feel it was a waste of time"
1,Too Slow,"I can't believe there are SO many positive reviews for this book! Am I reading the same book as everyone else? Blah, blah, blah - This story seems to drag on forever and not in a good way! Soooooo Very BORING."
2,Totally Disappointed!,"After reading all the favorable reviews on this book I was really anxious to read it. However, I had great difficulty plowing through it. In no way would I compare this to Jayne Eyre. I am a librarian, love to read , and had to force myself to finish the book. It was confusing, vague, and tedious. The characters all seemed superficial. I would not recommend it. I was totally disappointed and found it to be a long read."
2,Gravely Disappointing,"A dark dank disappointment and so confusing. The author never tells us exactly what year it is but it feels like the late 1800's. It can't be however because they do have automobiles. They apparently don't have TV's or cell phones, or even telephones because they only seem to communicate by letter, but there is reference to a ""computing machine"". The main character obviously has no access to a PC or a Xerox machine because she laboriously copies everything down by hand. The book is as dysfunctinal as it's characters and the story falls fall short of the hype."
2,Not very good,I thought for sure this book was going to be good but it was really difficult to finish it. It reminded me of the reliable wife. Needless to say I'm going to stay away from uk authors
1,not good,http://www.amazon.com/review/create-review?ie=UTF8&asin;=0743298039&store;=#In conclusion of what I had read in pages 13-56. I thought the book very hard to follow along with and author was all over the place. I felt the book not to be very interesting. I had hard time to continue to keep reading. I felt this was one of worst books I have read. I found the character Margaret to be as strange as author. I would not recommend this book to anyone to read. I give this book maybe a 2. I had very hard time writing this paper since I found this book really bad.
5,Great!,i was so discouraged to see some of the negative reviews on this book. I was completely engrossed in the spinning of this story. An easy read and hard to put down. Four friends have borrowed it and have also enjoyed the tale.
5,The Thirteenth Tale,"Excellent book. Well written and keeps your attention throughout. Mysteries are intricately woven through the book to keep the reader guessing, eager to see what comes next. Exceptionally well done for a first book by this author. Can't wait to see what comes next."
4,A tale worth waiting for,"If you are a lover of gothic tales, Jane Eyre style, this should be an entertaining read. Diane Setterfield sets a haunted tone in her impressive debut novel. There are many twists and turns throughout and, though the ending wasn't a complete surprise, it was very satisfying. The protagonist, a self proclaimed amateur biographer, finds herself in the employ of a famous reclusive author. Soon after agreeing to pen the author's one `true' biography - listening to her tales of mysterious twins, spectral figures, and suspicious fires - her own family ghosts are disturbed to great affect; many characters remark that she looks like she's 'seen a ghost'. There is a literary feel to this novel (Jane Eyre is invoked several times) that will appeal to classic book lovers. You can almost feel the wind redden your cheeks on the chilly Moors and smell the oak bookshelves in the amber-lit library.4.5 stars"
5,A True Gothic Novel,"Diane Setterfield demonstrates her deep talent for creating a setting and a world that you find yourself lost in. As a huge fan of Jane Austen's Jane Eyre, this tale was not a retelling of her story; it was instead a new tale woven with different threads but carrying the same tragic theme. Ms. Setterfield's work is a detailed and facinating story that seems to lead us down several paths, only to expertly and surprisingly tie all of the details together at the end. Read this on a dark and stormy night and you will not be dissapointed!"
4,Recommended to Me and Recommended to You,"I ate this book up in one week... which is saying a lot considering I haven't read a complete book in the last six months. The Thirteenth Tale is a fun read that takes the reader on a journey of hidden family secrets and mysteries. Actually, the ""theme"" of it reminded me a lot of the book Rebecca. So if you liked this one, I would recommend picking up Rebecca as well."
4,Good Escapism.,This story is captivating and keeps your interest throughout. It's a good read on a cool fall night in front of a fire.
4,Twists and turns.,The plot keeps your interest at a high level. You also need to pay attention.This is not a book you can skim through.
2,"SLOW, SLUGGISH & TEDIOUS","The narrator's personal story was boring & tedious, & became ""filler"" to the supposedly real story of the reclusive writer. I did stick with it to the end by speed reading over the repetitive stuff (and there's a lot)but I wouldn't do it again. Ultimately the story just wasn't much of a mystery or interesting."
1,She's no Jane Eyre,"This turgid, overblown, yet ultimately soporific tale is not aided by the unbearably pretentious accents of the two readers. Their plummy tones sound at turns angry and bored, and never deviate from these two modes. I am not surprised that this tale--which sounded promising based upon its advance publicity, which likened it to a rich Victorian mystery/romance--would have the life leached out of it by the windy self-consciousness of an academic-turned-writer. Only a handful of them are actually able to write clearly, much less compellingly, and Setterfield is not one of the handful.I spent many a tortured hour on long drives trying to drum up some interest in this story, and trying to ignore the absolutely nerve-jangling reading style (so slow, to boot) but finally left the tale at disc 11 (out of 13). I almost never do this, but finally realized I needed to cut my losses and just start listening to something I'd actually enjoy."
4,Captivating Tale,"I enjoyed this book once I read the first couple of chapters; it was a bit slow to start. I was captivated by the mystery of Vida Winter's and Margaret Lea's tales. I was somewhat horrified regarding the incest and sadomasochism used in the story. The descriptiveness of Charlie's room left my stomach about to heave, but I enjoyed the twists and turns and I found myself thinking about the book when I wasn't able to be reading it."
2,A great disappointment,Sorry to buck a trend. I didn't like it. Read Michael Cox's books. He is truly Dickensien in his ability to conjure up that time and ambience and have a good story.
2,disappointing,I read so many good reviews of this book that I had to get it for the Halloween season. It begins with an interesting and mysterious premise but soon evolves into pages of story with little excitement. I am at the last 5o pages of the book and perhaps I will find out why everyone else found this book so good. An antique book seller and his daughter operate a dusty old shop with valuable books. The daughter is invited by one of the top authors of the day to write her biography although she has been a recluse and resists others attempts to find out the truth of her life. The common thread between the author and biographer is that they are both twins. I am married to an identical twin and I am baffled by the excessive concentration on this one topic. Wait for it to go on the discount table.
3,Starts Better than it Ends,"Story line - Highly popular, but secretive author hires unknown proprietor of a used book store to write her bio. The book's title comes from the author never having published a much awaited Thirteenth Tale in one of her series. World wants to know why.If you are one of those who enjoy well written British novels with typical British period characters who in spite of whatever is happenning speak eloquently, then you may really enjoy this novel. One of the main characters even works in a rare book store. I mean, how much more bibliophic can you get.However, be prepared. I found the story to start off strong and then to run down hill. The plot becomes less and less intriguing as the story moves along. There is a twist at the end, but it isn't worth the long struggle to get there. Skimming may be in order.Since much of this book revolves around twins, if you are a twin, it may be of more interest to you.My recommendation - lukewarm at best."
2,Put them all in the asylum and be done with it,This book did not captivate me and made me wonder what all the 5 star reviewers have read previously. I enjoyed the beginning and the description of life in the bookstore. Other than that it it fell flat for me and was rather predictable. The twins needed a good spanking and maybe the author too.
3,Detailed and a little confusing,"Honestly, I didn't finish this book. We read it for my book group, and for some reason I just couldn't get into it like I usually do. I always read the books out of respect for the one who selected it. I did read more than half the book, so I will most likely finish it someday...maybe. I would rate what I read as fair...not spellbinding like some I read, but well written."
3,slow shipping/good product,"This book took a long time to ship to me (chose standard shipping and it took longer than normal). I needed it for a book club, so I had less time to read. But the product was good once I got it."
3,Gothic Tale that took a while to read,"I liked this book, but normally I can read a 500+ book in a day or two, it took me several days to read this and I could easily put it down. It is good writing, a gothic tale, there is mystery, angst, the old house, creepy people, etc.... but I have read much better gothics. So that is why I only rated 3 stars"
5,Go Ask Alice,"`Tis uniquely intriguing tales she weaves! Setterfield surrenders only shadow-murky character development to grand effect in this delicious blend of Gothic Carrie Rebecca Eyre falls Through the Looking Glass growing Flowers in the Attic. /TundraVision, Amazon Reviewer"
4,Tight Plot,"Overall an engaging read that keeps one guessing as to the nature of its ghosts: real or imagined? A well thought-out and intricate braided plot with only one tiny plot-hole that I noticed (I won't give anything away by saying that the small-town doctor would surely have known that the gardening boy did not have a grandmother). An intriguing read (though sometimes a little slow), though I was never truly creeped out the way I was with Sarah Waters's modern take on the gothic with The Little Stranger. The heroine's obsessive agonizing over her [you'll find out soon enough if you read it] felt a bit heavy-handed to me, but definitely a good rainy day book.--Jennifer D. Munro, ""The Strangler Fig: Stories"" author"
3,"Read carefully, it's twisted","Not crazy about the writing style of the author. At times a little slow and at the end, felt she rushed trying to wrap up some loose threads (that didn't necessarily need wrapping up), however, the storyline was very interesting and left a friend (who was also reading it) and I with LOTS to discuss. Love books that leave me thinking and wanting to talk about it."
3,Just OK,"I finished this book today. It took me over a month to read it, so I can't say it was a page-turner. The author obviously put her heart and soul into writing this novel. The writing is eloquent, but often over-the-top, giving it an air of pretentiousness. I found myself rolling my eyes quite a few times. Perhaps if this book wasn't given The Best of 2006 Amazon Editor's Award, and wasn't billed as a ghost story, I would have not been so disappointed. I was expecting a ""rousing good ghost story"" and a book worthy of a best of year award, but I got neither. It is a quality book; it just didn't hit the spot for me."
5,Surprisingly good!,"I was a bit hesitant to read this book....its raging success and vague plot description on the jacket deterred me from picking it up sooner. At a friend's suggestion (and in dire need of some gym reading) I dove in headfirst and didn't emerge for a week. The characters, plot, writing, and the author's love of books kept me enraptured. Great read."
4,A Truly Gripping Tale,I found this book to be along the lines of Daphne du Maurier novels. Gothic and a nice twist at the end. My mom was of the opinion that the twist at the end came of out left field but I felt there were plenty of hints along the way that allowed the twist to make sense.
2,Disappointing,I'm very surprised by all the hype this book is getting. It started off in an intriguing manner but never delivered.
1,Yech!,"I did not enjoy this book at all, if dysfunctional families is your bag, you will love it. This is the kind of book that when you finish reading it you wonder why you bothered."
3,"Didn't like, . . but still couldn't put it down!","I did not enjoy this book. The characters where so bazaar that it was difficult to relate to any of them. The beginning was so slow that I started skimming through the paragraphs. I have a rule that if I don't like a book after 50 pages then I stop reading. However, the mysteries surrounding the story had me so in intrigued that every time I put the book down ""for good"" I would find my self picking it back up just to see how it all turned out. I am glad I finished it but I probably won't recommend it to any of friends."
1,No Book,I have never received the book that I ordered from them. I waited until after the last day they said I would receive it to contact them and they weren't much help. I still haven't heard back from my second request for information about the book that I paid for but that never came. Very disappointed!
1,Dreadful. Did not finish!,"I think that this is one of the creepiest books, that is rife with the smarmiest charactures, that I have read. It got so confusing, and so disgusting that I almost got through, but I just couldn't make it. Save your money. If you must have it, get it used."
2,Poor Rehash of all Gothic Romance Novels,"I was waiting to read this book due to an excellent synopsis and reviews. Upon reading it, the first 3 chapters held me enthralled with its gothic mood and loved Lea's love of books. However, after the 3rd chapter, the storyline became very ""syrupy""...it was too inundated with all gothic themes that I feel was somehow borrowed from other classic and/or romantic gothic authors, such as Bronte, Collins, Walpole, even contemporary authors such as Holt and Whitney. Veda Winter seemed too much of a theatrical character to be believed. I'd much rather have read more of Lea's story than Veda's. It was a struggle to read past the 6th chapter and have decided to stop and not waste time I could be reading a better novel."
1,I'd Like My Money Back for this One,"I COURAGEOUSLY TRIED TO GET THROUGH THIS BOOK, BUT THERE WASN'T ANYTHING IN MY OPINION TO SAVE IT. FROM THE FIRST LAUNCHING INTO THE STORY OF CHARLIE AND ISABELLE I FOUND MYSELF SAYING TO MYSELF (ALWAYS A BAD SIGN), ""YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING"". THE PLOT WAS TOTALLY UNBELIEVABLE AND I WAS NOT ABLE TO CONNECT WITH ANY OF THE CHARACTERS ON ANY LEVEL. MAYBE THIS IS THE CORRECT GENDRE THESE DAYS AND RUNNING WIRES THROUGH YOUR ARMS AND EXCISING NAMES INTO YOUR FLESH AND BONES MIGHT BE CURRENTLY IN VOGUE...BUT THANK GOD IT IS NOT FOR ME. AND THEN TO HAVE THE UTTER GALL TO BRING PEOPLE INTO THIS NOVEL OF THE LIKES OF JANE AUSTIN, CHARLOTTE BRONTE AND OTHERS AS COMPARISION OF THIS WRITING TO THEIRS...IMPOSSIBLE. I'M GOING TO HAVE TO SEND THIS ONE BACK TO AMAZON. IT IS PROBABLY THE WORST BOOK I HAVE READ ALL YEAR...AND THAT COVERS A LOT OF BOOKS."
5,A Captivating Read,"This book is ideal for readers who enjoy the classic eighteenth century novels, and more specifically for a smaller number who treasure books as fine works of art. Most of these kinds of readers will find an empathetic connection to the narratior, which then aids in further pulling you into the thick story plot. This tale is sweet, shocking, comical, horrific, and heralds a romance about storytelling itself. Read it, you'll love it.As a side note, if you have not yet read Jane Eyre (I had not before reading this story), read it immediately preceding or immediately following this book. The Thirteenth Tale makes written connection to Jane Eyre on several occasions, and knowing Charlotte Bronte's novel gives the scenes in The Thirteenth Tale a deeper meaning, making the read that much more enjoyable."
3,"Disturbing, yet masterfully told","Great writing, disturbing story. I'm not sure I would read it again. If you like gothic stories of very odd, nearly mad, people - - then this book will satisfy you. I prefer to actually 'like' at least some of the characters in a book. The author is, however, quite talented; that much was obvious from the very first page. She certainly has the ability to immerse her readers into the world she created."
5,i adored this book,"I started by reading the sample. Before my sample was over, i was hooked. For the next few days i read at every chance i could find. The story draws u in and holds u tightly till the end. And beyond..."
3,Great quotes for bibliophiles,"I loved the beginning of this novel, and even copied, word for word, several passages about the power and importance of stories. Great beginning.The rest lagged for me, bogged down in beautiful but too-long descriptions, repetitions, and bulky transitions.Overall, I liked the dark and twisty plot and the strange characters. If only it had moved a little faster and ended a little less Hollywood (for example, it's not a love story, but Setterfield just has to throw in a love interest for the narrator at the end. Probably her agent demanded it. Fie on you, Hollywood.)"
3,Enjoyable story,"The Thirteenth Tale provided exactly what I was looking for in a novel - easy, entertaining and enjoyable. Not great literature, but a good read."
4,Thirteenth Tale,"Very nice mystery set in England. A bit slow in parts but a great story! Mystery story, love story and a bit of a thriller all in one."
4,Jane Eyre with a twist,"This was a very engaging story. Written in the style of a Gothic novel, this story is very reminiscent of Jane Eyre, with a unique twist. The secret to the story is revealed to the reader as the main character figures it out, in a very realistic way.What prevented this book from getting 5 stars was what I felt to be an unnecessary subplot that only served to bog the story down. I understand that our main character needed a ""hook"" of some kind to be convinced to write the biography she's been charged with writing, but I felt that Setterfield took the ""ghost story"" aspect of her lost twin too far.That would not stop me from heartily recommending this book to anyone who likes Gothic novels."
5,The thirteenth tale,Book was terrific. I couldn't put it down. Throughout you're trying to figure out and predict is this person really who he/she says he is etc. Great!!
5,What fun!,"I found this book totally diverting, and was especially proud of the way the author followed the rules and gave us every clue along the way, but I didn't begin to suspect the truth until the protagonist did. What masterful writing -- to skillfully lead your reader so! Ms. Setterfield's next book will be on my ""eagerly awaited"" list."
5,It was a can't put down book,"Being a lover of books, the descriptions that she used and narratives that she gave captivated me. I would recommend this book to anyone who loves the old history romance, or occasional murder mystery. Such an interesting plot twist at the end that was very unexpected"
4,This book was written by a skilled author.,"I loved the way she wrote. Everything was described perfectly. I found myself very interested in the story. Some things were confusing but I got them in the end. If you do choose to read this story and you are confused, come to me and I will answer your questions. Overall good book!"
4,A mysterious read,"For a first-time author, this book was actually quite good. You can tell research was done and time was taken with this book. Its a very strange sort of ghost story and is certainly more than meets the eye. Its unconventional and it works. I really got a sense of who the characters were and what was going on. Its all very mysterious, though not alot of action really occurs, which is fine. It's all in the story, or stories, as you'll find out if you read this. It is a quick read, not because its short, which it is, but because you'll be so enthralled, you won't want to put it down. I look forward to whatever the author writes next, and I do hope that she does."
2,The Thirteenth Tale: A Disappointment,"At first glance, this book looked very interesting: a reclusive, dying novelist choosing an unknown writer to share her life secrets. Moreover, the secrets she promised to reveal seemed to be very exciting. However, even though Ms. Setterfield is a talented writer, her novel failed to deliver. At times the novel moved very slowly, as unimportant details were given too much attention. Most importantly, the story was not that enthralling -- the mysteries of this woman's life were not that interesting. I suppose that I was expecting something different from this book, but I was disappointed."
2,A let down.,"This book has gotten a lot of undeserved hype. I managed to finish reading it but with some difficulty. Parts were quite compelling but much of it seemed contrived. I found I did not like any of the characters, which is not to say you have to like the characters to enjoy a book, but they all seemed shallow, self absorbed and soulless.The end of the book dragged on much longer than needed with unnecessary information as if the author attempted to tie it up with a bow for presentation, not content.I had high hopes for this book but it did not meet my expectations."
5,Beautiful gothic tale,"It took a while to get into the book, but once you stop judging, you were engrossed. This is a really lovely book, and the writing was so beautiful. Story about siblings Charlie and Isabelle, then Isabelle's twins, Adeline and Emmaline. There is an unique twist at the end, which blew my mind. I don't know which twin survived, which is part of the charm of the book. The book is completely bewitching, the writing is stellar. One of my favorite books. If there is a flaw, it is narrator, Margaret's sentimentality over Aurelius."
3,Feels like a throwback,"A book about books and the nature of telling stories and secrets. I liked it. It was slow at first, but then I got lost in the story. It had a style I'm starting to notice more and more - the book was set in modern day but aside from some necessary technology, the setting, plot and characters are reminiscent of turn-of-the-century books. Maybe it's a lingering effect of Austen's popularity."
3,Flowers in the Manse,"I love Gothic ghost stories, I love stories about books and I love beautifully constructed prose, but I only liked The Thirteenth Tale. Even though Diane Setterfield writes in a manner that evokes the Bronte sisters'Jane Eyre and Wuthering Heights, I detected more than a little influence of V. C. Andrews'Flowers in the Attic/Petals on the Wind). An alternative book to read is Carlos Ruiz Zafón'sThe Shadow of the Wind, an elegantly written Gothic story about books and those who love them. Or if vampires are your preferred creatures of the night, Elizabeth Kostova'sThe Historianis a hauntingly good choice."
2,Back to the haunted house in the moors,"Shades of Jane Eyre and any number of imitators: Shy, bookish young girl goes to isolated manor in the English countryside and discovers secrets.This has been done before, many times and to much better effect -- by the likes of the Bronte sisters, Daphne du Maurier, and by many lesser writers like Victoria Holt.I'm not saying that the genre isn't still viable, but it requires a sure hand on the part of the author -- decent prose and at least some degree of originality -- neither one of which this collection of cliches possesses."
3,who cares?,"I felt this book had some good moments, and just some who cares moments. I liked some of the stories about Margaret and I thought the interaction between her and Miss Winters was rather funny but thats about all for the good moments. The bad moments in this book were defiantly the over describing of every little detail, I grew weary reading over and over description after description where nothing was happening. I guess thats why I called them who cares moments, because really... who cares? I guess the writer just thought that might be a good way to get you into her world by over describing every detail. I think personally if she would have spent more time with stories about the characters and less time describing inanimate objects I might have cared a little more for this book."
5,Great gothic ghostly story,"The audio version is well narrated and superbly done. Be patient for the first 20 or minutes or so - at first I was like, oh dear, I'm not so sure this was a good purchase, but then, I couldn't stop listening. Fabulous writing! Wonderful, spooky story..many twists. I laughed; I cried and was entranced by the whole atmosphere of the story! And her ""experience"" at the end, with her unexpected visitor, warmed me so much! I also appreciated the way the author ""wrapped everything up"" at the end. It's a MUST listen!"
3,Beautiful prose,"Eliciting excellent prose was the mainstay of this novel. The author crafted superb sentences that flowed into each other, but the plot was not seamless. A good mystery should tie all the ends together; I felt the events were not woven tight enough to give this a great rating. Both main characters had secrets and Setterfield had no problem revealing their hidden agendas and pasts, but it seemed to take tooooo long."
1,Strange!,"I think this book is strange. The beginning seems very interesting and promising but once i got to the middle it got very wierd and boring. I couldnt even finish it, because it got to a point where i truely didnt care about what would happen, because i didnt care too much for the books main characters. This book was way too long and not interesting to me im sorry."
3,Don't Expect Jane Eyre,"Reviews that associate The Thirteenth Tale with Jane Eyre and Rebecca do the new novel a disservice, although there are references the DuMaurier and Bronte classics in The Tale. The earlier novels are love stories at heart; it's the plain girl winning the mysterious hero that we love so much. The narrator of the The Thirteenth Tale is a lonely,inatroverted young woman; but Sutterfield has no pity. There is family love of a sort, tragic and twisted, described in The Thirteenth Tale, but romantic love is nothing but a loose end tidied up at the end. I am sure Sutterfield knew what she was doing--she writes beautifully--but what a wonderful book it could have been if it had a heart."
1,Worst Book Ever,this is absolutely the worst book i have ever had to read. the plot never thickens as well as it could have. if i didnt have to read this book for my english class i would have stopped by page 20.
1,thought it would never end,"I couldn't be bothered finishing this .....it just seemed to go on and on ..getting more and more unbelievable with each chapter. Occasionly the writing was good but then , particularly with conversation, it was awful.Definitely not recomended."
2,Twin's identity--duh,"Um, has no one realized that Adeline and Emmaline would be easily distinguishable? Emmaline has a baby. She also has milk. She also has changes in her body below the waist. Being cared for as she is, it would be an obvious thing to check. In spite of being twins, there are individual marks, especially on Emmaline, from all the beatings inflicted upon her by her sister. This unsatisfactory and dishonest ending ruined an otherwise adequate book for me.I say adequate because, although I grew to like Vida Winter, I was more and more put off by the morbid self-pity of the narrator and the psuedo-mystery of her twin's demise. For me, this book was a mere pot-boiler. Settleton is a fine word crafter, and can spin a twisty turny plot, but she has yet to learn honesty."
2,"Too bad, so sad","I generally like Gothic novels and wanted to like this one. My chief complaint is that is there is nothing to tie this story to a specific time period. Much of the prose feels fairly modern and yet there is no mention of the Internet, no concrete descriptions of the world the narrator moves in. It all feels very dreamy and detached from reality. Worst of all, the author uses themes of incest and madness as plot teasers -- I felt like she was fluttering these things in front of me to try to get an unearned emotional response. That is just so wrong."
1,One of the most boring books that I have ever read....,"This was one of the most boring books that I have ever read. There was an over abundance of details that I thought had no relevance to the story itself. I would definitely not recommend this book to anyone, because I could not get into it. Boooooring!!!"
2,overall quite disappointing,"I read some very good reviews of this book, but unfortunately found itquite a disappointment. The story just seemed too contrived, and noneof the characters really interesting or likeable. When I thought aboutputting the book down there were always little developments that wouldpull me back in, and have me read a bit further. However, in the endthe resolution is pretty lame. Despite the fact that by theend of the story the author congratulates herself on neatly tying upall the loose ends, there are still a number of glaring inconsitencies.Indeed, rereading Jane Eyre seems to be a far better option."
1,Unreadable.,"The themes and subject matter might make for a great story, but the author just doesn't get it done. The author seems to convince many of her fans that it's a great book merely by raving in the book about reading books -- so much so that the book's narrator recounts falling from a wall as if swimming because she was so lost in a story about Water Babies. The author seems enamored with imagination for imagination's sake... even when it's neither compelling nor interesting nor suspenseful. Granted, I only finished the first 100 pages or so, but the author's ""voice"" was simply too much to bear. I'm surprised by the many rave reviews. And as a final gratuitous shot, the author's pretentious picture and pose on the back cover should have been an obvious signal to let this one go."
1,Way overrated! A struggle!,I just don't get it... this was one of the most painful books I have ever read. If it wasn't a book club pick I would have dumped it about page 100. Very tedious read - so tired of overrated reviews and fiction with a total lack of substance. Big waste of time.
2,Here is my tale........,"Finally finished reading this book after many previous attempts. I'm surprised I made it through. In my opinion, this novel's strong points were grossly overrated. It was hailed as a scary story of sorts, the type to give you nightmares. Seriously? It was slightly interesting, at best. The copy I read was given to me, glad I didn't spend money on it."
3,OK,"This book was neither wonderful or awful. It was interesting and I wanted to know where it was going. However, I found myself asking why the story went in the direction it did more than finding it a ""shocking twist'. Its a fast read and engaging enough. Take it to the beach or on a plane. I finished it yesterday and am still indifferent about the whole thing. All in all, give it a go if you are stuck."
5,A great read...,I enjoyed reading this book and after the first 60 pages I couldn't put it down. The stories of past and present intertwine beautifully and help build the tension and mystery in the book. I absolutely loved reading this the more and more the pages went on and was sad when there was nothing left to read. I classify this book as very unique and one that is hard for me to compare to any other mysteries I've read. A great read!
4,Vendor serices,"I purchased this excellent book from ""Tapshoe"" and would highly recommend this retailer. The book was in the mail to be before I received the email confirmation of my order."
2,Over-hyped,"I agree with the reviewer that said this book was over-hyped. I was expecting an intellectual thriller about books and/or authors. As a book lover myself, I thought 'what could be better than that'?!?! The book started out as very intriguing, but in the end it just couldn't live up to the hype. Extremely disappointed."
3,Beautifully written,Awesome writing but I'm still trying to figure out which sister was telling the tale????? Members of my Book Club felt the same way. Book needed more foreshadowing.
2,Not new.,"It was supposed to be new, that's what it said, that was an overstocked item. Not happy at all. I'll keep it because I need it for a school project."
4,Bookclub Choice.,"As was a bookclub choice, new nothing about the book or Author. Found it an interesting read, however felt it dragged on a little. Guessed the relationship between brother and sister on estate, but found the twist in the tale quite a surprise."
3,Tribute to the Bronte sisters...,"I read all these great reviews and found out the book did not live up to the hype. The story about a bookish, surviving twin woman in her 20's, living with her folks and working in a book store, feels like the 18th century. Out of the blue, she gets the opportunity to bio a BIG NAME British writer and takes off for the moors. Well, is this 21st century Britain? Are folks still running around with pencils and paper writing books? The story takes off with the dying BIG NAME claiming to being ready to confess it all. Well, the story turns into incest, insanity, and mystery. The tale is intellectually interesting, but the characters remained emotionally distant to me. Of course there is the surprise ending, so you can think back, wow, should have seen it coming. Similar to Edgar Sawtelle, a modern update of an old tale. Entertaining, but not romantic, despite all the allusions to the Bronte sisters."
4,delightful change for a strict nonfiction reader,"It is so rare as to be a recorded event that I pick up a work of fiction- but perhaps it was the cover art that drew me - such lovely work that I was pulled to peruse the book. It was a marvelous excursion! It didn't really matter that the book is not fixed in a particular time frame. That left my mind to imagine and wander even more broadly afield. The atmosphere of Yorkshire, the dust of the bookshop where Margaret and her family lived, the rage of Adeline and supposed passivity of Emmeline - too much to detail here but I was sorry to have run out of pages by the end of it. It will be awhile, probably, before I pick up another work of fiction, but when I see another book by this author, it will definitely be worth the purchase!"
5,Excellent Book,I thoroughly enjoyed this book in all respects. I have recommended it already to friends who liked it very much as well.
4,Story Telling at Its Best,"If you like a good story set in a bucolic village with a bit of horror, a bit of madness, and a mystery at its core, this is a book for you. Vida Winter, a reclusive author, has decided to tell the ""truth"" about her life, and has hired a young woman, Margaret, to listen to her stories, take notes and write the book. Margaret is the daughter of a bookseller with questions about her own past. She moves into the big old house and becomes mesmerized by the tales she is hearing. As she writes and researches she discovers not only the truth of Vida Winter's life, but that of her own. The book is filled with interesting characters, lots of suspense and a satisfactory ending."
2,Bored to tears,"I received this book as a gift from a friend who worked for one of the big book stores at the time. I was delighted at the thoughtful gift because I am an avid reader; however, half-way through the book, I was sorry I'd begun reading it. The story seemed overly dramatic, predictable, and at times clichéd. I sold the book back to a different book store shortly after finishing it, and felt just a little bit guilty about putting it out there for someone else to be disappointed in."
3,Plenty of buildup for little payoff,"Frankly I grow tired of these books that promise some deep exciting intrigue and really have a pretty tired premise by the end. This is well-written in regard to the language but the plot is not particularly inventive or new. ""Jane Eyre"" did the mad-woman-in-the-attic pretty well and this novel, while readable, is also somewhat forgettable. It would be a great beach read or a great winter break read when you don't have high expectations."
4,Perfect for flu season,"This is the kind of gothic, convoluted tale to curl up with on a rainy night. Eerie but confusing themes move slowly past your window and if you are a little feverish they may even make sense. It's a hard book to rush through (notice the terse, irritated reviews here) but I found it pleasurable and suspensful if you don't ask too much or think too hard."
4,Twists and turns amid family scandal and piles and piles of books,"Diane Setterfield's debut is just what I needed; an original story with enough twists and turns to keep you thinking long after you put the book down.Margaret Lea, a bookshop clerk who writes biographies of obscure people on the side, receives a letter inviting her to write the biography of the most acclaimed novelist of the century, Vida Winter. Little is known of Miss Winter except that over fifty years every time a journalist or biographer has tried to get her story she has spun a wonderful yarn completely different from the last version. Does she really want to tell Margaret her REAL story, or is she out to tell another wonderful, but fictional account of her life. Margaret sets out on a journey not only into the mind of a reclusive octagenarian novelist, but into her own past to uncover what it means to have a story and to share it.This is a must read for all book and story lovers. 4.5 stars."
5,I really liked this read !,"I found this book a really delightful read . I liked the story line ..it never got dull and I did not guess til almost the end what the heck WAS going on.. which happens rarely..I felt it read well, good development and flow.. I don't think you will be dissapointed. My only dissapointment was when I finished it.. AND IT CAME IN KINDLE FORMAT.."
3,The end ruins it,"There were some very good aspects to this book. Unfortunately, the COMPLETELY implausible ending ruined it. Who could think that made any sense?"
3,"Nice Style, Predictable Plot","Diane Setterfield's writing style is engrossing and her shifting through time and character make the book a enjoyable read- keeping your interest. The story though has too many predictable plot lines and overly dramatic behavior and endings for characters. Maybe one character in a novel has abnormal or outrageous behavior, but this book is packed with them. The ending is a twist, but you know it will be because Satterfield has done it to you several times already. It has some heart grabbing moments and is a bit on the scary side at times, but leaves you feeling a somewhat unsatisfied since you constantly know where she's taking the book, based on over foreshadowing."
3,"Better than mediocre, not quite good","I'd have given this book 3 1/2 stars if I could. At first I was captivated, but the characters couldn't hold me. The story was good, until the end when it became rather weak. The setting was evocative, but the characters were flat. With each reference to Jane Eyre, Wuthering Heights, and The Woman in White (of which there were many), I felt that I was reading the work of a wannabee."
3,A little too precious.,"Setterfield writes an interesting story. But her tone seems affected, as if she typed it wearing white laced gloves while sipping tea and krimpets. And the male characters were so dainty, fragile or just downright oblivious (as compared to the supernaurally strong women in the book), I got the feeling she's a bit of a misandrist. Strong beginning and middle. Struggling to get through the end."
1,Too Strange,"So glad I didn't purchase this book; checked it out from the library instead. It starts off fine, but quickly turns very bad. Very strange and not believable. It's more dysfunctional than mystery - incest, evil. None of the characters are normal or likeable, just weird. I cannot recommend this book, but if you still feel like you would like to read it, I recommend your local library."
1,"Sorry, found it flat","Ok, I read to page 127 and then skipped around as I could not yet find anything that made me want to keep reading. Maybe my problem is that I never liked the book, ""Wuthering Heights"" (yes I suffered and read the whole thing), so that is probably why I didn't like this one. Not my cup of tea?Yes, it was descriptive and the characters were different. But I just didn't find anything in the characters to identify with so they seemed ""flat"", not real, to me. So, then I didn't like the characters, so I didn't care about them. Plenty of description of the settings, but I felt it too wordy, not really pulling me in.Less is more? I think if it was maybe 180 pages as opposed to 400, it would have had more substance for me, a little more intense. But I just couldn't get into it. My neighbor was reading the book and felt the same way as I.So if you are thinking of buying the book, perhaps go to the library and read a few pages and see if it grips you or not."
2,Annoying Unanswered Questions,"I found several gaps in the story which distracted me from fully enjoying 'the 13th tale'. It seemed the author went out of her way not to give the reader any clues as to when the story took place. Although automobiles are mentioned, it could just as well be 1890 or 1990.Was the uncle/brother's body in the shed ever found? What happened to the Missus's remains? How did the other child arrive at the house and why did the Missus and John the Dig keep her from view? What was Margaret's hang-up about being a twin anyway and why blame her Mother, yet have such love and respect for her Father? The end of the book was over-the-top and magnified, for me, the flaws I found throughout."
3,"Worth a read, but not worthy of the top of your list...","We read this book for my book club. I feel that over all it was fairly average. Wasn't a great book, but was worth the read. It was different than many of the books I've read and therefore was at times interesting. I think the author was a little long winded at getting to the point/plot of the story, but that could be related to one of her main characters Ms. Winter. If she were real, she is the type of person I would expect to be long winded. She was after all telling her whole life's story.There were a few good twists at the end of the book which I won't spoil for you. However, there were entire portions of this book that I could have done without. Very good writing, a bit verbose, but again worth the read. If you are looking for something new to read and don't have any favorites on your reading list I would recommend this book."
5,WOW WOW WOW,"Take it from a true lover of literature...this is the most captivating and well written work of fiction by a contemporary author in many many years. It is no small feat for a new author to be compared to the likes of Jane Austen and the Bronte sister, but Setterfield delivers! I was not able to put this book down and read it in two sittings! The use of language in this book is absolutely beautiful. The experience of reading this novel can only be compared to an art lover seeing a Monet for the fist time. A must read."
5,A Simply Brilliant Tale,"For anyone who yearns to experience a really good ""snuggle in the blankets by the fire"" story, The Thirteenth Tale is definitely the book to read. Diane Setterfield expertly creates an unforgettable world of characters each with their own vivid set of dreams, regrets, and mysteries that will simultaneously haunt and enchant the reader. The Thirteenth Tale is a fictional masterpiece that no doubt reminds us how to absorb a story with childlike awe and captivation."
4,Very good,"I really enjoyed this book. When I sat down to read it, everything else around me faded away. I was truly absorbed in this book, and unfortunately, that does not happen as much as I'd like. I especially liked the passages in which the author spoke about her love of books, as I understood completely! Overall I thought the story was very well done and I loved the way she wrapped everything up at the end of the tale. I'm looking forward to reading more from Ms. Setterfield."
5,One of the best books I read in 2006!,"Amazing author. Amazing book. I am listening to the audiobook version of this story and I actually don't mind driving the hour to work since it is so fully engrossing. I recommend ""The Thirteenth Tale"" to everyone who enjoys excellent writing and a fun romp of a story."
5,"Inspired, with Momentum, and Twisted","While Kill Whitey starts well, its real power is that it grows in depth and intensity as it moves from beginning to end. Its characters, especially Macey (!), draw you in and not only haunt you, but give you much to think about. And if you are looking for a predictable plotline or ending, don't buy this book. Mr. Harvill creates a believable, twisted, amazing New England setting that unfortunately, is probably not as far from reality as you'd hope...Buy this book and buy it fast; Mr. Harvill needs people to read this book and hopefully get enough encouragement to write a sequel or series! Did I mention that he has the sexiest, hottest hit man (woman) that will leave you wanting more and more? Kudos to Mr. Harvill and whatever inspired him - I hope there is more to come!"
5,Pure Rock,Rapsody in Red alone is worth the price of this CD.It is without a doubt one of the finest insturmentals Rick Derringer has ever written.But there are other greats here as well such as the Appice tune Grey Day and Bogert's Telling Me Lies is a classic scorcher.And the boys prove they can tone it down a notch with the very thoughtful Turn On The Light.As a power trio this group has it all over the younger talent of today.Buy without delay!
2,Don't Waste Your Money!!,"I think that Derringer wrote the previous reviews ... 5 stars for what? Muddled guitar, so-so vocals, and bad songwriting? All three of these guys have some great music in their past, but sorry boys, the party's over."
1,Waste of time and money,"I bought this hoping Rick Derringer would prove he has improved as a guitar player given the company he is surrounded by. To my chagrin, he is still just a rythym guitar player trying to assume a lead role. It just goes to prove, Carmine will play with anybody just to make money. It's boring and quite disappointing. A kick [...] band with a mediocre guitarist. What's the point?"
5,"Good vitamin mix, tastes GREAT AND VEGETARIAN","Best Vegetarian multivitamin, grape is my favorite flavor. Its like a sweet snack every day:)"
4,Mixed Reviews from the Kids,One kid said it tasted great and the other one ran to the trash to spit it out. So we'll see.
1,Beware of FORMAT! NOT a DVD!,"Imagine my disappointment after paying $81.00 for this collection only to find it will not play due to ""regional restrictions""--it is not a DVD even though it is found under DVD on the website. The format is PAL, which for those of you like me who don't know, is the broadcast standard for Australia, United Kingdom, Germany, Singapore, and Hong Kong. The seller (who was highly rated) claims they ""are not responsible for product details."" Who is, I wonder? I was also amazed to see the same collection advertised at $53.00 a few weeks later. Buyer beware!"
3,This is a DVD.,"Folks, this is a DVD. It is just not in the format that the U.S. uses. The U.S. uses NTSC. Most everywhere else uses PAL. So, this IS A DVD! It is a PAL DVD not a NTSC DVD. You should still be able to watch this on a computer as they are not restricted by PAL or NTSC."
5,Enjoyable Lovejoy,"Lovejoy - The Complete Season 3Lovejoy - The Complete Season 1Lovejoy - The Complete Season 2Outstanding quality. Even more interesting than they were in the 1980's and 1990's when they were first aired.The stories are well written and acted. The English country scenes are very interesting. These clean, subtle British humor and mystery DVD's are most enjoyable.R. Kemmis, Fulton, NY, USA"
4,Lovejoy - Season 3,"Always a pleasure to watch the Lovejoy series. A nice way to escape fromthe day to day real life trials to a pleasing way of life in the beautiful British countryside with a touch of mystery, comedy and a story built around the antique business. Just Great!!!"
1,Disappointed in lack of PAL warning/,"I was very disappointed when i received the series 3 of Lovejoy DVD. In the description PAL is only mentioned in the fine detail. The item is listed as DVD. When ordering from Amazon US to a US address i would expect a product warning that the item cannot be played on US equipment. When i notified the merchant the response was essentially ""too bad, no returns"" i expect better information from Amazon. I do wish they would produce this product in a US version."
3,Didn't work for me.,"I purchased this a while back to hook up a sub-woofer to my existing system. I wanted to hook an amp and sub-woofer to my factory head unit in the trunk (to the speaker level outputs from the Bose system amp that is in the trunk.) This unit didn't work for me even though I verified it was hooked up properly to the wires going to the speakers. I verified all was well but, in the end, it took buying a different company's speaker to line level box and it worked great. It's too late to return this but wanted all to know of my experience. The other issue is be VERY careful with the gain adjustment screws. I used a very small screwdriver and was very careful but after turning the screws back and forth a few times, the screw stopped stopping at the ""full on"" stop but instead would turn round and round. Ugh..."
5,"Worked well, confused my installer at first.","I bought this because I was adding a 4 channel amp to my factory head unit that didn't have rca outputs. This 4 channel convertor cost less than buying 2 2-channel convertors from Best Buy. The installer said he hadn't seen one like this before, but after shopping around and checking reviews this one seems to be the one most people use! He figured it out and got it installed and it seems to work fine, he had no complaints after his initial grumblings."
2,Don't buy this,"This does not work. The gain adjustments come broken and if you barley attempt to adjust the remaining controls they break off and it is virtually impossible to repair them. If your trying to install subwoofers or an external amp your better off just getting a new head unit (aftermarket stereo). You can get a decent one for under $100 and the installation is no harder than this thing from what I understand. If your getting subs you could try the Scoshe 2 channel converter but I think you'll probably just get the same problems. Bottom line, just but a new stereo."
1,Stay Away from this Book,"The secret of Fatima revealed by a psychic? If you are a Christian with minimal faith, you'd find this concept hard to accept. The book is actually much worse, combining UFO conspiracy theory with some inane astral travel analogies to explain the so-called Fatima prophecy. This author Ray Stanford somehow conned a publisher to sell his absurdist fantasy, so don't help him by purchasing his book. There are numerous GOOD books on Fatima, including one by Lucia Santos herself. Avoid this one at all cost."
5,Solid little unit,"I have owned transformers of this type (typically used to plug a microphone with ""XLR"" plug into a guitar amplifier) of several brands, and this is the one that's held up the longest. Here's a hint: label it with your name and phone number - these things are so handy, they wind up ""disappearing"" when your equipment is mixed together with other peoples' :O"
1,Garbage,All I can say is it came broken right out of the package. Just extremely poor quality. I could never recomend this piece of garbage.
5,Adapter does what it's supposed to do.,"Buy it. Install it. Forget about it.This does just what it was designed to do. I've been using it for about six months with no issues. The adapter has no effect on sound quality. You won't even know it's there, which is what I want from a product like this."
1,No communication/Orders not filled,"I ordered this product in early November. No word from Seller.Amazon notified me weeks later they hadn't heard either,then got a cancellation notice from Amazon.Item was still listed online, so ordered again, now after a week, second cancel notice from Amazon. Item is STILL listed in stock for this vendor!1) DON'T LIST ITEMS YOU DON'T HAVE TO SELL2) Let the buyer know yourself what's going on3) Follow up on orders earlier so we can plan aheadBAD experience with this retailer"
2,Not what it seemed,"This is another movie where the trailer made it look like there's a lot of action/creepy things going on, but the action that was there happened mainly at the end. It was random and confusing. There is a twist to the movie which was its only saving grace. Terrible."
2,"I thought it was a pourer, too.","Don't be fooled by the photo. This is nothing more than a very expensive cork. That little circle on the end of each stopper is decorative, and not an opening to pour through. Not sure what the purpose of designing a cork to look exactly like a pourer is, but it's my mistake. A very expensive mistake."
1,"Sam, you made the stoppers too tall . . .",". . . for any but the top-most shelf in my refrigerator. They may work well and look great on a buffet table, but practical for left-over wine kept in the frig, they are not! The 1.5 inches they add to the height of the bottle means ""select space only"" in my frig. Also, they are too wide a stopper for all but the widest mouth bottles: long slender-necked bottles need not apply. All in all, I made a rash and unfortunate choice when I selected these stoppers."
2,Quite useless outside the US,"Many recipes use products which are not widely available in Europe (at least in France, Belgium and Italy!)"
5,I adore anything from Swami Satchindananda,"I feel a connection with Swami Satchindananda, I happened to meet probably one of the only people in my area that was blessed to be under his direct teachings. Anything I have read from him comes from a very humble and peaceful place, and helps me to stay focused in my humble and peaceful place."
4,Nice Book,Pleasant daily readings to center your spirit. I usually read one at bedtime so that I go to sleep with a pleasant thought.
1,Save your Money!!!,"This book is awful. I have read the entire thing, and it says nothing that is useful. I have been in public accounting for 10 years, and i am now ready to start my own firm. I wasted my money on buying this book. I know it is tempting to buy, since the title is exactly what i was looking for, but trust me, choose another book. The accounting Guild website that the author constantly refers to is no longer in existence."
3,Buyer Beware!,"This book is an excellent source for starting an accounting practice. It is very heavy on the aspects of technology and working that into your business to grow clients and business partners.The caveat here is this. Mr. Fox discusses Arthur Anderson a great deal in this book when referring to ways consulting is performed and how to sell clients. In addition, he refers to his own ""Accounting Guild."" Unfortunately, the web site for this guild no longer exists, his Yahoo message board is inactive and he does not answer email requesting information on solvency of his own business. Although I am reading this book 3 years after it was published I find it disturbing that the book is still in print yet very out of date and no longer factually correct. i.e Offering services in the Accounting Guild.It would be nice to at least get an explanation or have the book removed as a valid and complete source, which it no longer is."
2,Waste of time and money,This book is not the fountain of knowledge to starting your own accounting firm. It reads like a pamphlet or magazine article.
2,some information,"Like most books you do get some information. Pricing was good, but his web-site is unavailable, so who knows"
3,"some interesting content, slow going","Most of what I choose to read is non-fiction on cognition, education, memetics, and language. That said, I found this book hard to read. It has some interesting content, but it's broken up by so much detail it's hard to see the big picture. I finally got through it by skimming most of the chapters and doing a close read on bits that were interesting to me.His premise is that physical evolution of human brains and cultural evolution of language have proceeded together, shaping one another, so that languages evolved to be more learnable by humans at the same time humans evolved to be better at language. This kind of interaction is categorized as ""Baldwinian selection"", which is an elaboration of Darwinian selection (not a conflicting view).Deacon draws evidence from a wide range of sources including paleontology, live brain scans, electrode experiments, and animal behavior."
3,Disappointing,"Could have been a better book with a clearer vision and better writing.The author could not decide on his audience. Too much convoluted gobbledygook for the average reader, not focused and specific enough for the professional.Much material that most anyone will just gloss over looking for sense and direction in the text."
1,Provocative but for the wrong reasons.,"This one is a peculiar mix of populist polemic and third rate scientific argument. Deacon's approach to argument is endless repetition and obfuscation with detail. The initial chapters on indexical,iconic and symolic representation and language acquisition are hardly original and here needlessly complicated. Thick knotted prose, sweeping unsupported statements and carelessly ""constructed"" arguments abound. It is astounding and intensely disappointing to read the gushing uncritical reviews as well. In short, this book is a menace to critical thinking on this subject."
2,Wish it worked...,"After filling the chamber with fuel and attempting to start the torch with the automatic trigger, it wouldn't ignite. And while the prospect of returning it did cross my mind, the idea of sitting there trying to empty the chamber of all its fuel was not appealing (since you can't return this device with fuel in it). So I resolved myself to igniting it with a lighter or match to get the job done. Works well enough once it's ignited, but obviously it's not as handy as I would have liked...wish I could recommend it..."
1,The Worst,"For anyone who has a fond memory of this amazing docudrama--skip this release. Product looks and sounds as if it were copied from a budget VHS 20 years ago. Ranks up there with THE DEVILS, and FABIOLA for worst print of all time."
4,"Review Of ""Swinging On A Gate""","Overall I liked the CD. The music was enjoyable, although the compositions were unknown to me. The performances on the hammered dulcimer and guitar were good, but I would prefer the sound of the hammered dulcimer to be more accentuated. I've heared other recordings of the hammered dulcimer instrument in which the sound of the instrument was really outstanding, predominant over other instruments."
1,Take a Pass,"It is difficult for me to write negative comments about an artist who plays the same instrument that I play - that of course being a hammered dulcimer. I would not consider, at this point in my development, recording a CD for sale to the public because I, just like Phil Passen, do not play well enough. There are a number of brilliant hammered dulcimer players with CDs on the market. They represent the music and the instrument well. With research you will find these artists. Take a pass on this CD."
4,comfort food,"This is a very pleasant, ""soothing"" CD that is great to put on the player in the evening and unwind to. I particularly like the simple, uncomplicated melodies that have that ""comfort food"" feel. In addition to the fine playing of both musicians, it is a very clean recording that is tightly produced. I'd like to hear more from these fellows."
5,Real Songs for Real Life and Real Love,"Bill Cantos hits the mark in expressing the highs and lows of life and love in this album of ""new standards"". A ""must have"" for those romantic occasions for which you want to set a certain mood or ambience. ""You've Got Me"" is a most playful song about committment and my favorite; running a close second is the title song ""Love Wins"" which gives new hope to life in general.Keep up the great work, Bill! God bless you!"
5,Fun and Educational,"I don't care how others rate this software. I know that two nights after getting it, I could make phrases in German that I would use as a tourist. I recorded my pronunciation to match it to the voice on disk, and I felt like I was becoming a true German. Foreign exchange students in our high school were amazed that I could speak to them in their language. And, I did it with no embarrasement. I can't wait for my trip to Frankfurt."
2,There better be something better than this!,"The other reviews seem right on in that they note a big jump between the super-basic nature of the first CD, and the complex sentences thrown at you in the second. What stood out to me is the total lack of grammer and structure. A basic concept in German is that nouns are: a) capitolized and b) always male, female, or neutral in gender. Neither is touched on. This software will not help you put a sentence together at all! It's good for helping you pronounce simple nouns, but that is all.Also, the ""speaking dictionary"" only speaks in English, and so is no help in pronouncing words in German."
4,Electronic Savior,"The last star was held back because of the gap between the first and second disks. While the first desk is perfect for beginners, you'll need to get another helper (I used German for Dummies) to bridge the gap.Of note, however, the first disk by itself is six-stars! I successfully used that disk to get around (barely) just fine in Germany - keep in mind most Germans do speak English, and in fact the younger generations (<30) in big cities may get offended if you presume otherwise.None the less, the first disk is perfect. And with something to span to the second, the rest of the course is great - and this is coming from someone engaged to be married to a German Woman - talk about insteresting conversation with the in-laws!!!"
2,Am I missing something?,"The first CD starts out with some basic words and phrases, not bad for a beginner. The problem occurs with the second CD, it is entirely in German-- none of which is taught in the first CD. They definitely need to bridge the gap in order for this to be useful. I was disappointed."
5,Nice Shoe!,Cute shoe and I do like the shoe. My angel has a wide width and the shoe width is okay but I should have ordered a wide.
5,Worth every cent,"I started using Murad years ago but tried to cut costs by using only a few products and using cheaper products for my daily skin routine. Well, at 56 I just felt my skin wasn't looking great and I was getting sick and tired of trying different brands of products (not to mention spending money thinking I was saving money). My 30 yr old daughter started using an entire line of Murad products and I noticed her skin was looking great. That was when I decided to invest in the entire Resurgence line of products. I started with the wash to day/night treatments, the mask etc. It was a costly order but the results are worth it! It is only 2 weeks since I have been using the entire Resurgence treatment and the results are amazing. Even my husband noticed the difference. Don't waste money trying to 'save' money. I will never look for any other skin care products because I don't have to, I finally found what was right there for years!"
5,Great eye cream!,I've been using this product for over 6 months now and I love it! Only eye cream that has been able to diminish my stubborn crows feet! I have used numerous different products and none of them come even close!! This is a must have!!
3,Good,This is an okay eye-cream. I do not think it is anything special for the money and will not repurchase.
2,Not a good eye cream,"This eye cream does not do much for your eyes. It does not moisturize enough and it also does nothing for wrinkles. For what the product does, the price is way too high even for Amazon!"
1,Murad Resurgence Renewing Eye Cream,"One use of this cream made my eyes puffy for 3 days. I've used other Murad eye creams and had no problem. I am currently trying to get a refund from Murad. I do NOT RECOMMEND using this product. If you are compelled to try it, make sure nobody is going to see you for a few days in case you puff up like I did!"
5,Great for puffiness,"I got a free sample of this in my latest sephora order but was pretty skeptical about any product that makes skin appear firmer. I'm in my early 20's, so my focus is the puffiness or ""bags"" under my eyes- not sagging skin or wrinkles. After I wash my skin and use toner I put this on and I have to say what a difference! By the time I get to my foundation my skin looks tight and there is no puffiness at all! I use the tiniest bit under each eye so a 0.14 oz sample has lasted me over a month, and I use this everyday! I love how 'awake' this makes me look instead of constantly being told I look tired. GREAT product if you don't expect plastic surgery results. I will be purchasing once this runs out."
4,Value Investing for Dummies,"It is a good book for beginners in the subject of value investing. It is quite comprehensive but a bit long-winded at times.The only problem I find is that, for practical purposes, it stated that either you create your own intrinsic value model using Excel/Lotus spreadsheet or use the prepackaged Web model - the Quicken Stock Analyzer. However, to use the Quicken Stock Analyzer, you need to be a member. To get a Quicken.com Member ID, you need a current version of Quicken 2001, 2002, 2003 or 2004. When you install and register your copy of Quicken, you can specify your desired Quicken.com Member ID at that time.If you, a beginner, does not use Quicken software or does not know how to input the given formula into the Excel worksheet - tough. Another way is to read a more difficult book by A. Damodaran on value investing.Other than the above, the book is a good introduction and the first book to be read on value investing."
3,Their next one might really be outta sight,"Melodic power pop with a singer whose adenoidal vocals are an acquired taste. As an album, ""The Scene's Out of Sight"" is bouncy, kinda fun, and unafraid of swapping spazzy energy for melancholic introspection. Actionslacks will never light the world on fire, but they're good enough that someone, somewhere, might cherish them as a favorite band."
5,Hot Pop Doo Wop A Lotta Bam Boom!,"This is the missing link between Louis Jordan and Elvis Presley. Billy Ward, the brains behind the outfit, was uncanny in his ability to hear just the right vocals and vocalists for his great r&b upbeat numbers and doo wop ballads. Can there be no greater rock moment than the immortal ""Sixty Minute Man"", a naughty-naughty hit from the puritanical pre-Elvis fifties that begged for censure! (OK, OK, ""Work With Me Annie"" comes close!) Rhino's excellent reissue boasts immaculate sound reproduction, all the great hits (check out ""Pedal Pushin' Papa"") and wonderful notes, too! This is essential stuff for lovers of rock's formative years. It's so much an influence, extremely important historically, but - and here's the fun part - it still swings after all this time! Hotcha!"
2,Naaah!!! too commercial,"This cd isn't good rockin' tonight, it's booring, the songs are strictly commercial and way overproduced and stiff, no soul or rock. Skip Bill and his dominoes"
2,Jazzed up Ink Spots imitators,"This is nothing innovative or all that interesting, in fact vocally it's very annoying and has nothing to to with rock'n'roll. This is NOT the missing like between Roy Brown and Elvis Pressley, this is the rightly forgotten jazzed up Ink Spots imitation group. The Ink Spts sounded dated and tacky from the beginning, using tenor on top of bass, as often bone here but more upbeat. B-O-R-I-N-G. I give it two stars only because the title songs is cool and so is r&b msuic, just EXCLUDING thsi very un-original group, that doesn't belong in the r'n'r hall of fame but in the CORNY music hall of fame alongside the Ink Spots and other goofy doowop groups."
3,The Anna Russel Album,"Miss Russel quite funny as usual, but buyers should be warned that these CDs are cheap reissues lacking the original booklet with all the texts and lyrics.Unfortunately they are not advertised as such !!!!!!"
3,Intelligent and musical fun.-,"Due to the recent passing away of the legenday Anna Russell I bought this record and certainly did not regret it.- Inspite of having been originally recorded in 1952 and 1953 the sound is very good.- Ms. Russell combines a great sense of humour with profound musical knowledge, a wonderful timing of her jokes, and the talent of a gifted and very musical singer.- She captures the essence of the German lied, the French mélodie, the efforts of a dramatic soprano to make herself heard over the huge Wagnerian orchestra, culminating in her famous, already classic, 22 minutes long analysis of Wagner's Ring of the Nibelungs.- I listened to this recording three times in a row and had great fun.- Only Victor Borge can be compared to her with respect to this rare combination of deep musicianship with a real gift for comedy.- If you don't know yet these numbers, don't hesitate - buy the record, you will not be sorry.-"
3,Arrived fine but damaged,"Item arrived fine but was scratched in some spots. It was for a present so with time limit I didn't feel like sending it back. It's fine other than the scratches, though I won't ever buy a second hand item on amazon again."
2,The Anna Russell Album,This was not the operatic commediene I was looking for and the inside jokes and British humor were not especially enjoyable for me.
4,Book on CD,"I listened to this book on CD with Dick Hill reading. First, Mr Hill is one of is not the best book reader out there; especially with Frank Muller not reading anymore so I figured it must be a decent book if he was the reader. I was really impressed with how the book was written and the detail, action, ect. Definitely a MUST READ!"
2,"Twists, turns, thud","I just finished listening to the audio version of this book; I must say it kept my interest until the final chapters. Oh, I was still interested then, but that's when it began to get really goofy, and the ending was just dismal as far as I was concerned.I remember I tried another Deutermann book some time ago, and gave up on it. I thought this one would turn my opinion of him around, but instead I believe I've now found an author I don't even need to try any more."
2,Surprising Twists And Turns,"A German mercenary working for a rich terrorist faction in Saudi Arabia has a plan to assassinate the new American president and cause major collateral damage. Swamp Morgan, a retired Secret Service agent, is brought in by the newly formed Department Of Homeland Security to determine if a fire at a Washington DC plastic surgery clinic is a firefly (not a serious threat to national security) or the first wave of a terrorist plot. This story bogs down in places with too much detail and the numerous acronyms for government agencies were a little annoying, but the action scenes were very good. I liked the characters, especially Swamp Morgan and Nurse Connie Wall. This wasn't an easy read, but the conclusion was full of suspense and surprises and made it all worthwhile."
1,The most disappointing book I've ever read,"I am a big fan of Deutermann's previous novels. This one was not an easy read, but I decided to invest the time in it since I am such a fan. After struggling through 400 odd pages I finally got to the ""twist"". It was so far fetched I stopped reading it with only 40 pages to go until the end. I have never invested so much time in a novel and not finished it. That's how bad this book is. I wouldn't recommend it to anybody."
3,Good until the end,"Pretty good thriller, though its by no means a quick read.I found the ending (which I won't spoil) to be very unbelievable and far-fetched. I love a good twist, but this one seemed too fantastical.Also, there's far too many abbreviations to keep track of- OSI, PRU, and so on. I kept having to flip back to remember what each agency abbreviation stood for.Beyond that, it's pretty good, and pretty engrossing. There are some parts that are a little clunky, but for the most part, it's good. I like the characters, in particular Connie Wall and Jake Cullen."
4,"Entertaining, a wee bit far-fetched","Retired Secret Service Agent Swamp Morgan is sent to handle a potential 'firefly' case involving the murder of several doctors and nurses at a plastic surgery clinic. Apparently the doctors are in the habit of taping their patients while they are recovering from surgery and blackmailing them with the details at a later date. During one of the recovered transcripts a suspicious transcript surfaces about a bomb plot. Could it just be the ramblings of an unconcious man, or something more sinsiter?This story starts off a bit slow with the killer targeting the doctors and nurses. But the character, Swamp is likeable and methodical in his detective work. The middle section involves Connie, a nurse who was off-duty the night of the murder and her struggle with being bait for the killer.I'm giving this 4 stars just because the ending was really goofy. I can't give it away, but... Well... It was a gotcha type ending you are either going to like or loathe."
4,Great colors!,"I love the image on the shower curtain, it is absolutely beautiful! The only problems I have are the smell (it is absolutely horrid, I hope it goes away soon) and the material. I knew it was vinyl, so I knew what I was getting into, I would much rather have cloth. I am hoping the creases go out soon.It is a gorgeous shower curtain and goes great with my decor!"
3,Just Okay,"i was excited when this shower curtain came in. Yet, after two weeks I took it down. White walls does it no justice regardless of the accessories. Mint/pale green or pale blue walls in the bathroom would suit it best."
2,"Cheap, but expect to go through them quickly.","I've owned two pair, and both have thus far developed shorts in the cabling despite careful handling. Next time I'll just spend the extra money and get Shure or Sennheiser headphones."
2,"Only OK sound, Bad Quality","In school I went through 5 pairs of these when video editing. They're NOT for music. No bass etc.The cables get ruined very easily in all the places they are connected (the connection by the headphone cup, the mini-jack and so on). When this happens the sound disappears whenever you move your head etc.In my class (all had these headphones) at least 90% had to get new ones at least once.If you are only using them for editing home videos and such, and are EXTREMELY careful with the cables they're OK.2 stars may be generous."
3,LOUD,"Fast Delivery, Has ample power, My JL Audio's cant take it. Some Distortion on high levels, but i dont keep it that high anyways."
3,Nice but unoriginal,"Before you buy this CD, buy the Coyote Ugly OST.The 4 songs by LeAnn Rimes are excellent!Then buy this karaoke CD to really enjoy the music then sing along with it.Worth the money!"
2,"Not ""stainless!""","Company's need to stop calling ""stainless steel"" stainless when it's clearly not. I've had this knife set about a year and every one of the blades on the smaller knives is rusted."
5,Great set of knifes!,"These knifes are great.. For the price you cant beat this set, they are HIGH CARBON like the high dollar German made knifes so you will need to hand wash them or they will rust (just like the high dollar knifes) if you are looking for a never rust blade just go buy a cheap knife that is solid stainless.. it will cut like junk, but it wont rust.. If you are looking for a great set of QUALITY knifes for a good price you cant go wrong with these.."
5,Exceptional value and quality.,"I finally decided to throw out the knives I had been tolerating over the last several years and purchase the Cuisinart set. These ended up being a much nicer knife set than I had expected. They are extremely sharp and sturdy and do a wonderful job. The set includes the knives that are the most handy and versatile. The bread knife is great, even with very soft bread. The block is very attractive. I don't like things sitting on the kitchen counter but this truly does compliment my kitchen. You won't be disappointed!"
2,Boring.,"I don't know if it's this kind of ""essay collection"" book that I don't like, but now I'm looking for a more complete biography on Ella. But the text is most of the time very journalisticand boring, and way too positive to sound like a biography. I should have paid attention to the title ""seven decades of commentary"". My bad."
4,This little piggy is our fave!,"The Easter Bunny brought this to my then 22 month old. This is a small toy, but it was a perfect size for the Easter basket. He was able to work this toy independently immediately. For this reason, I definitely think it would be good (and more of a challenge) for younger childen, but even at two he enjoys putting the coins in the slot, dumping them, and starting over again. We haven't had trouble with the door falling off, but I find my son is gentler on toys than my nephews and some of his friends. I would definitely recommend this product!"
5,A great toy!,My daughters recieved this for their first Christmas and they loved it. Especially the coins. They were only 6 months old at the time and they loved to chew on the coins and carry them around with them everywhere. At the time we didn't know you could purchase extra coins but you can! That is a great idea! The coins themselves are a great toy. The piggy bank itself is so cute and the girls love the songs and pushing the piggy nose. They played with this for many hours. We have given it as a gift as well.
3,Very Frustrating!,"This is actually a great toy that my daughter (14 months) LOVES...if she can get the bank to open! The door to the pig is so difficult to open there is no way a child of any age can open this door. I have trouble opening it and sometimes have to use a knife to open the door! The counting sequence also goes to fast in my opinion. If she drops a coin and is on #5, by the time she picks the coin up to put in the bank it's already starting over at #1.Other than those two things she loves putting the coins in and the noises it makes and taking them out of the door (if she can open it)."
5,wonderful toy for my 18 month old granddaughter,great toy for my 18 month old granddaughter. It has given her hours of fun and she loves the hiccup
4,Loads of Fun,"I bought this for our 16 month old, as she loves to put things in and out and in and out. I give it 4 stars because although it is a great toy for things going in and out, my daughters (another also age 2 1/2) are unable to open the piggy bank door to get the coins out. They constantly have to bring it to me to open."
4,Short-term fun,"My daughter got this for her first birthday and is still playing with it 6 months later - so it's a winner! That said, this is not a toy that holds her attention for a long time. It's a fun thing to play with for a few minutes, but this doesn't drive any imaginative play or anything that can turn into long-term play."
4,gift,This was a gift for a preschooler. She loved it and played with it for a very long time. Also teaches not just for play.
5,Neat Toy!,"This is a great toy. The coins are very easy for a baby to hold and manipulate. My six month old loves for me to place a coin on the slot, and then he pushes it into the bank. I love that the coins are different colors and two different sizes. Older kids can learn more than just counting, they can learn ""big and little"" and sorting skills.The only thing I don't love about it is that the door comes off quite easily. But we just snap it back on."
4,Fun Toy,"This is a fun little toy. It has some cute songs, and it helps children learn too. The only thing I didn't like about it is the from part where the coins go comes off very easy, and little ones have a hard time putting it back on."
2,The Counting Sensor Sticks,"Right out of the box, the button that the coins push against to ""count"" the coins gets stuck, so when my son is playing with it, it doesn't count correctly. He's put in three coins but the pig says he's put in one, etc...We have to snap the button back out for it to start counting again, and then after a few more coins it will just stick again. Happens every single time he plays with it and so it is totally useless to help him learn his numbers. Such a cute idea but very bad quality, very disappointed."
5,My 11 months girl loves this piggy bank!,"I bought this toy about month ago. It has some songs n sounds when you push a nose of the piggy bank.My girl like to dancing with the songs. After one month later, she knows how to put the coins in the toy.! It is awesome~! I can tell her how to save money in the future."
4,Great to play with once an adult opens the door,"Our 20 month old grandaughter loves her ""pigee."" The basic problem is that she is unable to open the door to the pig to get out the discs in order to use them. She needs adult help and it isn't that easy for adults to open quickly.She is learning to count to five and says her colors. She lines the discs up in order of size or matches by color. She immediately figured out how to use her finger to have the sounds begin. She just puts her finger in the slot and pushes on the trigger mechanism.I'd suggest that the door problem be fixed and that the trigger mechanism be placed where children can not reach it with their fingers."
3,Door comes off constantly,"This is a cute toy, my 2 boys love playing with the ""coins"". However, the door comes off pretty much every time they open it. It's easy for an adult to put back on - though it's annoying that a simple toy that costs $30 isn't better constructed - but they can't do it themselves (the older one is almost 3). Overall, there are better toys to spend your money on."
5,Best little bank,I bought this for my one year old and it has been an absolute joy!! She really enjoys playing this and it is great for developing fine motor skills. Well worth it!!
5,Exactly what I was looking for!,Educational- check! Absolutely adorable and not annoyingly loud- check! Fisher Price quality- check! Just what I was looking for- check!
5,Love it!,"I bought this for my 14 month old son. Almost no toys capture his attention, but this one did. It was bigger than I expected. He love putting the coins in and hearing the music play. He likes to keep the little door open on it so that he can imediately get the coins out. Very cute. It is a great price too, in the stores it is a little more expensive."
4,Such a cute little piggy!,"I like what this toy does. The tunes are not annoying nor is the voice. I'm glad it gives you ten coins, the volume is at a decent range, sometimes I wish it could be a little higher or the speaker placed in a different position. Another problem I have with this is the door comes off so easily. It doesn't fall off, but she easily takes it off all the time and I keep having to put it back on which is a pain. But I still like it and would still recommend this toy to others."
3,mind your fingers,"Our 7 month old was given this toy as an easter present, and instantly he was loving it. He tries to get the coins in the slot, but doesn't quite have the dexterity, yet. However, he loves the sounds and the songs, and he can open and close the door. Unfortunately, I feel like I need to take this away from him and put it on a shelf for a couple of months. In the last 24 hours he has pinched his fingers in the door twice, and screamed bloody murder. I know the age recommendation is 6-36 months, but perhaps it should be amended. Or there should be a latch on the door that makes it able to be ""locked."" It's a shame, it really is great otherwise."
2,Don't recommend,My daughter received this toy for her 1st birthday. It was ok at first but then the door quit shutting all the way making the toy not function as it normally would.
4,My Son Really Likes It!!,My son is very hard to please at times but when I came home with this toy he really liked it he could not wait for me to take it out the box and when I did he was gone on his own little way overall we both like the toy.
2,Boring toy. Doesn't teach much.,"I am pretty tired of toys that look cute but don't teach much. The only thing this teaches is numbers. Everytime you drop in a coin, the switch in the coin slot reacts and the pig counts the next consecutive number.The bank could have been a lot more educational, if it could recognize different coin values (there are 3 different size coins) or colors (there are 4 colors). Instead, each coin simply makes the pig count up one number.So this toy doesn't really teach colors at all. I'd say a (non-electronic) pack of crayons teaches more about colors than this toy.If you lose a coin, the pig won't be able to count to 10 unless you remove and re-insert a coin. besides number counting, the only other features are fluff: an Old MacDonald song that advances a few notes with each coin and a handful of pig related speech when the nose is pressed.On the plus side, this toy has survived a handful of falls from the high chair."
4,Great Fun but......,"My daughter got this around 1 year old and she had lots of fun putting the coins in the slot, hearing it count and play music, then opening the door to collect all of her ""money"" and do it all over again. The only problem was that the clear door kept coming off and we finally lost it, so she no longer plays with it now that the money just falls out. As for the educational value one reviewer spoke of...the age range for this is 6 mos to 36 mos. My son just started learning the monetary value system this year (1st grade) and although we introduced values much earlier..I think this is mainly for a much younger age that is learning dexterity and basic counting skills as well as recognizing different sizes and colors (the coins). This toy teaches young children plenty as well as being fun as a toy should be. This was one of my daughters faves until we lost the door!"
5,My Great Grandaughter Loved This,I got this product for my Great Grandaughter for her Birthday. She just turned 3. She loves it and it is also educational as well as fun for her. Would recommend it for any child her age.
1,Small coins are dangerous for younger children!,My one year old daughter received this toy as a gift. She was able to put one of the smaller coins in her mouth completely and I had to reach into her mouth to get it out. It was in her mouth so far that no part of the coin was sticking out. I did contact Fisher-Price so they were aware of the problem. If your child is young please put the smaller coins away.
2,My 3 year old lost interest after one day,"My son just turned three and received this toy as a present. I thought it would be good because it would help him understand money. However, he lost interest in the toy after playing with it for only one day."
5,My 16mo. Baby Girl Loves her Piggy,"This has got to be the best purchase for my baby girl--she generally loses intereste fast, therefore, she has a room full of neglected toys. Well she received this Piggy Bank for Christmas and it is simply adorable. It's educational, durable (sustained a few falls already and still holding up), and cute. The bank comes with 10 large coins, which is the perfect fit for baby's hands. When the coins are placed in the slot, they are counted, or there is a music option as well. This toy promotes hand/eye coordination and cause and effect as well. Once the coins are in the piggy bank, the bank is opened and all of the coins fall out and the fun starts all over. This toy definitely keeps my baby girl occupied for at least 15-20 min, which is a plus. I definitely recommend!"
4,Great toy for 6-18 months!!!!,"This is a great toy! It challenges the babies because they have to turn the coin a certain way in order for it to get into the slot. I bought for my daughter at 7 months and she played with it until about 18 months. She is almost 20 months now and is not interested anymore because she can easily get the coins in the slot. We just packed it away for the next baby. BUT, GREAT TOY FOR A BABY BUT WOULD NOT BUY FOR A CHILD OVER 2 YEARS!"
3,kind of boring,"I picked this up because i love most of the laugh and learn line, but this was a giant flop with both of my girls ( 1 year and 2 1/2)"
5,Great little piggy!,"This toy was purchased at Kohls last Christmas on sale for $12.99. It was an awesome choice. We have twins that have played and played and played with this. The door doesn't close as tightly as it once did, but they really enjoy it. I also babysit triplets and another set of twins and they all love it too. I wish I could find another one at a yard sale so we would have an extra on hand when everyone wants to play with it. It's gonna be a keeper for future grand babies! Can't go wrong with this toy!"
4,Learning piggy bank,Bought this instead of the fisher-price treasure chest because the reviews for the piggy bank were more favorable than the treasure chest.
4,too cute to resist,"We've had this toy for about 6 months now, and our 12 month old is just starting to figure out how to put the coins in the slot. Her almost 3 year old sister also loves the toy, comparing the sizes of the coins, commenting on the different colors, etc.positives = not a noisy toy, simple fun with numbers, extra learning with parent/baby animals and colors, good for practicing hand/eye coordinationnegatives = bank is difficult for child to open, child might get bored with the toy after 10-15 minutes"
5,Lots of fun,"This toy is great! My 19 month old loves it. She learns about taking turns by her putting a coin in then giving one to me to put in, etc. Learn about sizes (bigger, smaller). Learn colors, animals, front/back. Also fun with the music. And you can move the pig around and make pig noises. The only minor complaint is that it is difficult to get the side door open for the pieces to come out when all of the pieces are in. It isn't hard if even one piece is not inside. Just if all of the pieces are."
2,Too Slow!,"So... on this CD, we have Carlo Maria Giulini, the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra and the last two Symphonies by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. The recording engineers captured the sound of the orchestra using 20-digital recording for ""high definition sound."" That's what got me to buy this CD. The sound itself is really good, BUT...Something's wrong here. Shouldn't the pieces be played a little faster? Never mind how great it sounds! The great Giulini had chosen a slow tempo, which would make you think the symphonies are taking forever and could bore you.You might as well get the 1965 recording on London. I did and it was worth it! (It's been recommended above)."
3,Very nice looking sword,"I was especting this to be a little bit different than it was when I ordered it. The cutless didn't fully go into the sheath for an easier draw of the sword, but that fact was not mentioned and the picture shows it going all the way down. Very missleading if you ask me. The tip of the sheath fell off so I had to glue it back on. Looks nicer in the picture, but still has it's flaws. Still a nice sword though."
4,Great Fit and price,"I was looking for a mid size sword to wear at the ren fair, this fit the bill perfect. Looks good, and good price. Not for kids sword is sharp."
3,"Nice Sword for the Price, but BE CAREFUL!!!","This sword is a quality built prop/replica. It's nice and heavy. It is definitely made for right handed people, so lefties be forewarned. However, the blade and tip are SHARP!!! The sword I received IS a deadly weapon -- very capable of hurting someone. So be very careful with this cutlass. The scabboard is made of wood with metal accents. The metal tip on my scabboard was very loose, so I glued it on (and realigned it to fit the scabboard nicely). All-in-all, this is a pretty good, pretty dangerous sword at a very nice price."
4,Better product than anticipated,"Again this is one of those products that just seemed to be to good to be true for the price. When it arrived I was amazed at the heft and the feel. The feel of a real blade is there, the construction and handle are all well formed and the detail was very nicely done. I've seen much worse blades for 3x the price."
2,Sent the wrong battery,The vendor shipped the wrong battery. It was for a different Powerbook size. Returned the battery and didn't order another. Wasted over a week with no battery while waiting for this part to ship and arrive.
5,Best grinder available.,"I've used many grinders over the years, and these take the cake. The pepper grinder will make your pepper as coarse as you like it. The salt mill is equally well built and designed, but you have to grind a lot of salt to get your food to taste. For the pair I give five stars."
1,Run of the Mill [pun intended],"I cannot figure out how to get a coarse grind. At the price I paid, It should have various grinds. The directions for use are almost non-existant. Live and learn!"
4,Quality Mill,This mill is high quality. It is going strong after two years. Filling it can be messy.
3,"Was It Really ""New""?","Described & sold as ""New"", the Peugeot 6-inch Fidji ""Wild Cherry"" Salt Mill arrived promptly & securely packaged. Missing an original ""New"" box, wrappings, or papers it did have an authentic hang tag on the knob but used salt still rattled around inside. The mechanism works fine & the exterior appearance is good, but not ""New""."
2,"Not the item pictured, Beware","The width of the spade is about the same as the hole you thread the cable through. The product is okay and I may be able to use these in the future, if I buy a McIntosh, but it is misrepresented. These are barrier strip spades and will not fit on normal binding posts."
3,"WELL WRITTEN, COMBINATION SCI-FI, ROMANCE & RELIGION","Book is well written with a good story line. It is a cross between a sci-fi and a romance novel. There is a dose of religion thrown in for good measure ""just cause"". I skipped over those parts.It kept me reading to see how it would turn out. I thought I had it figured, but was just a lttle different ending than I expected. A good book for young teenage readers."
5,A true message of God's love,"I find myself on a fascinating adventure that takes me to times, planets and people of a distant civilization I could not imagine! So great to have an action story that still has the true message of God's love. O. Miller, retired state legislator"
5,Why aren't they better known?,"This was a great CD, well worth the measly 11 dollars. I'm sure I've heard it in a Burger King or a Lift somewhere, but with its throbbing bassline, beautiful vocals and inspirational keybpard playing, I loved it! This band will surely make it big soon!"
1,"complete junk, stick with maxell or sony",2 of the 5 discs failed on me with some footage that was priceless. Stay away from these.
2,OK but could be much better written,The information contains in the book makes it a pretty good primer on SIP. The organization of the book and its content is very good. The language and ways in which the author explains certain things are confusing. I think the author should be able to do a much better job in explaining things. I often find myself having to re-read certain explainations twice and much carefully when I feel I shouldn't have to -- the topics are not complicated but not well explained. Someone like Doug Comer or Richard Stevens would probably be able to make it a much easier read.
1,crap knife set,I have had a set for a year and there are many notches in the blades. They seem too soft to hold a good edge and too brittle to handle use. My chef knife just snapped in half crushing garlic.
2,"8"" Chef Knife tip cracked","The set has a pleasant visual appearance. I've owned it for over a year and it does a fair job. Chef knif use to go blunt quite often. And unfortunately, the tip of the 8"" chef knife cracked and left me with dissapointment. I wouldn't buy this product again."
2,So So DVD,"If you are a true KISS fan, you might want this in your collection but you wouldn't be missing much if you didn't buy it. What KISS concert footage (which consists of maybe 3-4 songs) is shown is awesome. Most of the DVD is of a KISS copy band in LA. While they are okay, it is not why I bought this DVD. One of the interviews of KISS is totally inaudible."
2,Poor camera work.,Watching the concert video will give you a headache. The cameras are constantly switching back and forth between band members.
4,Murder My Sweet,This book is about a girl and her mom ( a foamous mystery novalist ) go to a party for her uncle while they are there there was a murder and her mom decides to crack the case but in the mean time she is also putting her and her childs life in danger.
2,Tedious,"This book was a disappointment. I found it boring and ridiculous, and Jenny's mom, who's supposed to be there for comic relief, is annoying and distracting. Jenny and Carlos' relationship is cute, but the murders seem unrealistic and the suspects there for a party. Pointless, mindless, messy."
2,Not Very Good,"This was the first book I read by Joan Lowery Nixon and I was very dissapointed. I had heard such good things about her. I didn't want to read any books by her ever again, but decided I should give it another shot. So, I read the book Whispers From The Dead. It was VERY good. I guess this is NOT one of her better books. It was slow and boring. Not exciting at all. The plot was good but it was too bad that the story was so bad. It was almost as though the plot was wasted. If you are going to read a book by Joan do Not choose this one."
4,I thought this was a wonderful book!,"Loan Lowery's book Murder, My Sweet is about murders and scandals. In this book Jennifer faces a couple of problems when someone murders Poter, Jennifer's mom's cousins's son. While her and her mother try to find the murder with the help of Detective Dovan, there's another murder during the investagation. This time it is Logan, Poter's son. Now the murder is after Jennifer. Will the solve the case before the murder can kill Jennifer? Or will it be too late?"
2,"Silly, overdone ""road comedy"".","Michael Allin's ""Christmas Kid"" deserves coal in its stocking. It is isn't the worst book I've read, but it is not anywhere near good. Our ""hero"" is Kit Carson ""Casey"" Reikart, a slacker college student that must pass his courses, or be forced to go into a real job: his father's insurance firm. Casey, of course, has other ideas, like improve his surfing and have a fellow student write that all-important paper on ""Deliverence"". Casey's luck is further messed up when he loses his plane ticket in an underground poker game with some decidedly rough people. So, Casey then has an epiphany, and steals a Santa suit, and prompty has some odd road adventures with a high school couple on the run, then an oversexed married women, and then a tow driver with blackouts. After this, Casey hooks up with a slick Vegas P.R man in Barstow, California, and he goes to Vegas as the ""Hitchhiking Santa"". Then the story is rushed to an inane conclusion where he gets home to Kansas City."
4,Gerry McGoldrick's finest to date....,"Solid For Sixty are just plain good. This record, written by former frontman of Philadelphia bands Napalm Sunday, Emily Valentine, and Customer is his best work so far. He really has a knack for writing catchy, top notch pop songs. This time around he has surrounded himself with some seriously great musicians, most notably Frank Brown of Buzz Zeemer & Flight of Mavis (which I must say, is one of my all time favorite bands that just never got signed thanks to the friggin Gin Blossoms).The Secret of Magnets (still wondering how they came up with that title) is a great peice of work. McGoldrick often times sounds a bit like Mick Jagger, but for the most part this is an excellent example of alternative country music. It's something that you must hear to appreciate. Pick up a copy. This is the real stuff."
3,"Weird, addictive, gives you a bit of gas",These are crazy addictive little buggers. The menthol flavor doesn't appeal to many folks: I've tried to give some away with few takers. These do not give you the horrendous gas that the alcohol sugar treat give you but they do give you some. I probably won't buy these again.
5,I love this product!,"All I can say is I love Lakerol Special Menthol Liqorice throat drops. I hope this product will always be available through Amazon. I can't find this product anywhere else. If Amazon stops carrying this product, I will be without my favorite throat drops. This product cures my cough quicker than any other throat drop on the market. The liqorice taste is very pleasant and doesn't seem like medicine at all but rather like candy."
4,Fritz 8 is nice.,"I guess Fritz 8 is stronger than chessmaster 8000 (GOOD). I have almost the whole family of chessmaster xxxx (from 2000 to 8000). Fritz 8 human interface is not very friendly or intuitive, maybe I spent too much time with the chessmaster series. I could not find the self-play mode in Fritz. The analysis of Fritz is very professional, it even uses the international symbols to grade the position. However I'd like to see another mode to give numeric values at each position like chessmaster, the symbol =/+ , +/=, etc. are not specific enough (at least to a detail player like me.) The user manual is hard to follow.OK, 4 1/2 stars."
5,Required,"Most know this program well, that being said if you wish to improve your chess and need an outstanding sparring partner and access to online play this is the program to own. It is the rolls royce of chess programs."
2,Full of bugs,"The above reviewer who noted that Fritz 8 was full of bugs sure wasn't kidding. The chess play is all right, but if you want to do something simple like saving a game or a position, well, forget it. I've just spent two hours trying to save a few positions, and I've been directed all over the place, but I still haven't been able to save just 3 games. In the future I'll have to replay each game each time to get to an established position. The directions are unclear, incomplete, or just don't work. A simple process such as saving and retreiving games should be, well, simple and user-friendly. Either my copy is defective or you have to be a grandmaster in software to figure out how the $%@*^%* thing works."
3,Worst User Interface Ever Designed!!,"This program has a lot of features, however, it's pretty close to impossible to figure out how to get the features to work. I've never in my life seen a program with such a non-discoverable, non-intuitive, obscure interface. What is truly amazing about this program, is you can read the manual and still not figure out how to use the features! I've just spent 2 hours (including studying the manual) trying to figure out how to load a PGN file of some games that I've played to use the analysis features of the program and I still have no clue how to do it. Unbelievable. I've used several other chess programs and never had to even open the manual. I've used 100's of windows programs and this is clearly the worst interface I've ever seen."
5,great item,Does excellent job. I was so tired of using the old fashion basters that when I used them the liquid would end up all over the place but in the container I wanted it in. This does not drip and you will love it.
4,"Works well, relatively easy to clean.","Held correctly, this thing really is dripless. Held incorrectly, not so much. You get the hang of it quickly, though. It has a good capacity for liquid in the bulb and is relatively easy to clean for this type of kitchen tool. Happy with my purchase."
4,Great,"Worked great for Thanksgiving and the ""no drip"" end really does work - nice feature. Only thing I wish is that it was a little bigger and collected more juice."
3,Made with high quality material; not dripless for me.. ;/,"Well, I will say this is made of high quality, and even came with an extra tip for the end; however, it dripped and made a mess just like my other basters. Bummer. Still looking for a dripless baster."
1,Not worth seeing,"My wife and I tried, really tried to watch this movie, and it went nowhere. It was probably the biggest disappointment we've seen in years. Boring, and so s-l-o-w you feel like cutting off your own limbs for entertainment. We give this an all toes down."
3,Well.... at least it's better than Screaming Dead.,"Which isn't saying much. This movie could have been called Living Room Nightmare because that's where 90% of the movie takes place. The only outside scene is the backyard for a five minute dialog.Basiclly this movie boils down to a cannabilistic husband and wife who are in dire need of a marriage counselor. The wife was pretty hot and I thought it unfortunate she didn't get a nude scene. She reminded me of a girl I worked with at McDonald's who I wanted real bad.Anyway. These two have flashbacks which are pretty uninteresting as they try to figure out where their marriage went bad. They have a daughter who's supposed to be asleep upstairs, but manages to give plenty of lines. The only other cast is another husband and wife who are poisoned at dinner and a couple of cops who show up later at the door.This movie is good to watch once, but a second time would be rather dull."
1,Black comedy at its worst,"Jon Keyes directed this black-humored and odd black comedy that is not scary or funny but dumb and dull with unlikable characters,a badly written plot,and a very low budget. The movie is very reminiscent to Paul Bartel's Eating Raoul and Bob Balaban's Parents but the movie is a couple that argue about everything and then the wife gets mad and harasses a teenage girl in the basement and then tries to kill her husband as well as the husband trying to kill her. For a low-budget black comedy this is a unwatchable mess with no redeeming values. Despite the title the movie takes place in the couple's dining room,kitchen,and the living room and the front cover has nothing to do with this movie because it is not a slasher flick but a bizarre soap opera-ish movie that looks like a Lifetime movie."
5,UK Cell Phone Cover,I love this cover. It fits over your existing case and looks very goos. It has protected my cell phone from drops and accidents. I would really advise any true UK fan to get one of these
5,Easy to read and useful!,"It is the one of the best. It is more used for general fitness than serious weight lifter. Usually, it takes a few months to notice result in weight training, as such, it is important to keep a training log. For convenient and substainable motivation, I have used my mobile phone as a log from [...] in the gym."
2,It's not so useful!,"I bought this cuz I wanted to arange a simple schedule for my bodybuilding program and it really didn't help me that much...this book is filled with common sense knowledge...nothing more,no good help for even a beginner bodybuilder or an average educated person!"
2,Too much theory,"I wanted a book that gives clear guidelines on how to work out effectively, but this book disappointed me. There's a lot of unnecessary stuff on workout theory, and the chapters on exercises are poorly written."
4,Workout for Dummies,Very well writen book. I hate working out but this book has a lot of good information to keep workouts interesting and usfull.
2,Wouuts jus form beginers,I guess I thought it would have some great types of workouts and all that but if your more than a house wife that is looking for inspiration then don't get this.
3,we don't need no stinkin',"i'm no dummy but i sure need help with a lot of things, i sure wish could finish this book, too bad i can't reed or right."
4,BIZARRE,"Oh this movie...freaky, violent, sexy. It was captivating yet disturbing! Couldn't stop thinking about it for days. Had to call friends to suggest that they see this movie. WOW-just wow!"
1,What the...?????,"Probably the lamest waste of my money. Wait... the lamest waste of time making, production money, etc... Except for a couple of cute guys in the film, this movie was an absolute just waste. The production value is worse than those movies I made in Junior High. Is there a way to do NO STARS? Like maybe negative stars?"
1,I missed the point,"Shiner was one of the poorest investments I've made in a while. The camera work appears to be hand held camcorder. the story line is all over the place and the bottom line is I was not able to finish watching the film. I watched about 45 minutes and kept hoping it would get better but it didn't. I had to turn it off because it was boring, low budget and poorly acted. I really try to say good things about the films and try to understand the artistic view however try as I may, this film was bad. A very poor investment."
2,BLOODLUST is better,"If you want guys getting hot by wailing on each other, try BLOODLUST indtead. While not a perfect movie, it has far superior visuals, editing, music and performnaces. Its a sendup of late 70s horror films, but set in the internet age. The movie is AMAZINGLY well-done (especially since it too is a no budget digital feature), and covers some of the same ground SHINER hints at- only does it MUCH better."
4,Another Voice of the 1990s GOP !!!!,"Alexander was another individual involved in the 1990s GOP who was not listened to by many within the party. Rather most were drinking heavily from the fountain of Newt. We all know how that ended. At any rate, Alexander offered a policy view that emphasized more investment in the US and its citizens. This was not where others wanted the party to go, Newt and the boys wanted to cut out all social spending. Lamar disagreed and offered a platform based on responsible spending. So just do not forget that these GOP members did exist at one time, but know they just seem to have disappeared for the time being. Anyway, this is a good policy book, but a little corny at times. That is why is one gets four stars."
2,It's ok,"The costume we bought was not of the best quality. There were areas of the costume where the stitching was coming unraveled even before we tried it on our 3 month old. She looked cute as a button in it, but I was seriously bummed about the quality of the product. After one washing, it is falling apart and will have to be restitched in order to be worn again."
4,What he said,Rick below me here pretty much said everything I could. I love Authority Zero and the acoustic renditions of their songs come off very nicely. Even a few songs that were fast and crazy got toned down into some groovy cool tunes. It's def. a good buy if you like the band. Check it out! You won't be disappointed.
5,buy this album!,"a friend played this for me a few years back and it has haunted me ever since. but, i was always hesitant to put down the (Money) for import. though the recording is not the best and the album is relatively short -- it's tantamount to an early beatles recording, african style. includes a young youssou n'dour and will be appreciated by anyone who's disenchanted with the overproduced stuff he puts out for the international market now. a classic that you will play over and over and over again."
4,"Good product, but pricey & a little unfair","Fair warning: I'm a true-red Microsoft hater, and a MacFan for life. :) Now that I've gotten that bias confessed, I must say that this kit provides the user of an older (pre-USB) Mac everything he/she needs to connect his/her Palm to his/her Mac, like the PC people do. So far the software has worked flawlessly, and the adapter has been secure ... definitely no product complaints here.The ONLY gripe I can give it is that the price is a little high for a simple serial adapter and software you can download from Palm's web site. Adding insult to injury is the fact that PC users get everything they need out-of-the-box (at least with the Palm IIIxe) to HotSync, while we MacUsers have to wait for delivery of another product. I didn't look around for less expensive serial adapters, and obviously the convenience of having the software on CD-ROM beats a slow download any day. Still, it does feel a little unfair at times."
3,Not everything you need...,"I ordered a Palm m500 and knew I would be connecting to an older Mac without a USB port. After spending quite a bit of time on the Palm web site and not finding much info, a Google search lead me back to Amazon.com and this kit.. When I got the Palm I realized I needed a Serial cradle. I think I'll also need the connect kit to connect to the modem or printer port. It would be nice if this kind of info was more readily available.. Oh well, it the price to pay for being both a Mac user and not up on the latest technology. But I do have a USB cradle in case I ever upgrade my MAc"
5,Great pepper mill,The look and function of this pepper mill are great. I would buy this pepper mill again and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good pepper mill.
3,salt and pepper mill overrated,"both pepper and salt mills look ok. i dont think its worth 45.00 each.when i opened the box, 1 mill was all apart and both plastic bags theywere in were open and salt and pepper went everywhere"
1,Poor pepper grinding,"I received the salt and pepper grinders as a gift for our anniversary from my husband. The salt mill works flawlessly, but the pepper mill barely works. I wanted to return it but had not idea how to do it, so I'm stuck with something that doesn't work."
5,Great Trim Caulk Gun,"I needed to touch up about 90% of my houses trim caulk around all the baseboards and grew very frustrated with my construction caulk gun. It would squeeze out way too much caulk and after I removed the handle pressure it would continue to drip out.After looking on amazon reviews, this not only seemed to fit the bill but was incredibly cheap.I probably caulked 500 linear feet the day I got this gun and absolutely love it. It is very easy to lay down a uniform bead of caulk and when you stop pulling the trigger, it stops dispensing. I know this sounds simple, but my other caulk guns aren't capable of this.Love it - highly recommended."
5,last caulk gun I hope I buy,"Wow, I have had caulk guns from the stores that vary from the cheap to the top of the line and this beats them all. With most guns when you pull back on the pressure rod you get no resistance, this one you feel strong steady tension and that is what make the difference. The spring is strong so when you pull the trigger to advance the caulk that is what makes for a steady bead. If I am doing a bunch of caulking I have an air gun [use with compressor] which supplies even pressure but if I don't want to drag a hose or it is a smaller job this the one I'll use. My only observation is I wish the end of the pressure rod had a little more of a hook to it so that it will stay in your belt if you are climbing ladders or up high."
3,"It's decent, maybe not quite worth the cost depending on your use.","I'd call it ""drips less"" rather than ""dripless"" as there are still some drips to contend with in my experience (although much less than with your typical gun).The 18:1 ratio is great if you're working with thick or cold caulks, but with your run-of-the-mill caulk or sealants, you're trading an easier trigger squeeze for more frequent squeezing. I find it easier to lay down a long, consistent bead (e.g., 8' of baseboard to wall caulking) with guns that offer less mechanical advantage.Last quibble is that there is no recess at the ""nozzle"" end of the gun to hold the caulk tube in place. Not normally a huge issue because the tube is pressed into place by the plunger but, at times, the tube can get jostled out of position.Otherwise, pretty nicely put together, sturdy, the trigger's a good/comfortable shape. It has its place but there a probably better ""compromise"" guns for general painting/household use."
3,Not What I Expected,"It's my fault, I'm sure, but I thought I was ordering a DVD with real concert footage and then people talking about what they saw. What I got was 5-15 seconds of concert footage of Greenday, footage of other bands playing old stuff, and a bunch of Brits talking about why they did or didn't like that part of the CD for minutes on end. It was very hard to even pay attention to the concert footage because of the way the DVD is edited (multi-screens showing at the same time). For me, I felt this was a waste of my money, but that's me.Some of the good parts were seeing some rare footage of The Ramones and then guitar lessons, but other then that felt like I got ripped off on this one."
1,"You are really looking for ""Bullet In A Bible"" not this waste","Misleading DVD. Should not even be sold by Amazon. If you want the Green Day concert DVD, buy ""Bullet In A Bible"".This DVD is basically a DVD of Critics talking about the band with minimal concert footage. A waste of time and money. Bad gift for a Green Day fan."
1,The biggest waste of money,"If you are a Green Day fan, no... even half a Green Day fan. This poorly made, uninteresting DVD offers you no additional information or insight into Green Day or the albulm. Every piece of information can be extracted from Green Day web sites and interviews. It was pointless and the worst output of money I have ever done. I believe it is a concoction of some Brits who wanted to cash in on Green Day's fame."
1,Rip off of Story Tellers,The footage they show of Green Day in this video was all from their Story Tellers show where they played the songs from American Idiot and answered questions from the crowd. What's worse is that this dvd seems to be a review of that show which was already a review with comments from Green Day themselves. Total waste of time and money. I am very easy to please but this is just painful.
2,Poor Quality Production and Too Much Explanation,"I was looking for Ballet exercise than an instructional class. In addition the video quality and the accompanying music was poor. I have had better ones bought on Amazon.com. Having said that, it is a very good instructional video for those who are actually looking for detailed explanation of execution of barre and center works."
1,Disappointing,"This could have been a brilliant book, but his long winded,English-as-a second-language sentence construction and low key ending really bombed it out."
5,A GREATEST HITS COLLECTION,"In the seventies Crystal Gayle (Loretta Lynn's younger sister) was one of the most successful crossover country artists and this valuable collection explains why. It contains her massive 1977 hit Don't It Make My Brown Eyes Blue plus the next year's number one, Heart Mender. In addition, there are the soulful slow ballads I Still Miss Someone, Talking In Your Sleep and When I Dream, the wistful Someday Soon and another big hit, the catchy Hello I Love You. And if those weren't enough, the melodic beauties Dreaming My Dreams, Too Good To Throw Away and Cry Me A River are superb too. It's a pity the brilliant songs Why Have You Left The One You Left Me For? and Wayward Wind from the album When I Dream have been omitted, but that's my only complaint. This is a wonderful anthology of quality country-pop containing gems aplenty."
2,Cutlery,The cutlery is very stylish and pretty. It was purchased at a very resonable price but needs to be sharpened more often then my Chicago set. For the price I can sharpen more often.
3,Nice set for what I paid.,I think it was well worth what I paid for it but not the original sales price. This is a sharp knife set and attractive.
2,Not worth it,"I bought this for my husband expecting a more detailed book. Instead, it covers the very basics, and as to the hopping up, anyone who is familiar with their bike already knows all the tricks.Would be good for someone just learning the ""tricks"" on Harleys."
5,"AMAZING! ::: silly, fun, serious & even spiritual!",Track Listing: 1.Smurfing Bells 2.Winter Wonderland 3.Santa Claus Is on His Way 4.Let Us Sing Together 5.Church Bells Are Singing 6.O Christmas Tree 7.Christmas Presents 8.Little Drummer Boy 9.Twelve Days of Christmas 10.Santa Claus Will Come Tonight 11.Deck the Halls 12.Bells Jingle 13.Silent Night 14.We Wish You a Merry Christmas
4,Nice Tubing But Costly,"We purchased this tubing over the internet, because we were not aware we could purchase it at a local retailer. It comes in handy to hide all the cords and make everything look nice and neat. Besides the fact that it matches the white baseboard, so it is barely noticable. We purchased a few tubes at a local retailer for much less, but we will keep the product for future use."
1,You have to dial slowly,"You can't dial numbers quickly because the phone doesn't pick them up and pass them along to the phone company. Half my calls didn't go through until I figured out you have to wait a moment to hear the click after each number dialed. Now, that is bad!My previous AT&T; phone had an equally bad but different problem. Well, this is the last AT&T; phone I will every buy."
5,more!,"To be frank, I have never heard this CD-set (yet).But I heard and enjoyed immensely the separate LP records some years ago. Rudolf Serkin was one of the greatest pianists of the 20th century, and was especially brilliant in... Mozart, Schumann, Brahms and Beethoven (and Schubert). And this particular interpretation of Strauss's Burleske is great fun!Please, Sony Classical, more Serkin masterworks! (Beethoven's Diabelli? Brahms's Haendel variations?)"
1,Don't let the title fool you!,"These books have the most misleading titles! Unless you are teaching Sunday school bible classes, this book is mostly useless, because the only examples it gives you are about how to better teach the bible.I bought this book and 'The Seven Laws of the Learner' hoping to learn how to teach better, and to get in touch with modern teaching skills. What a disappointment and a waste of money! It went straight to the garbage can. I wish I could give it NO stars!"
5,The hits in a small cardboard wallet,"For Underworld fans, this is a great buy for the usual hits such as: Born Slippy Nuxx, Pearl's Girl, Jumbo, King Of Snake, Cowgirl, and more, along with some rare tracks such as: Spikee & Big Mouth. This has always been a 2-disc set that I have listened to over and over again and it never gets old or boring, but gets better and better through the different motions each song gives you. There is nothing special about the Limited Edition though (I bought it anyway so I had it, heh) as it only comes with an interesting fold-out poster, otherwise, the CD's are the same and don't have any extra tracks...Just get the standard jewel case 2-CD set."
2,8: Chef Knife tip cracked,"The set has a pleasant visual appearance. I've owned it for over a year and it does a fair job. Chef knif use to go blunt quite often. And unfortunately, the tip of the 8"" chef knife cracked and left me with dissapointment. I wouldn't buy this product again."
1,Don't Waste the money,Unpolished lyrics and note transitions and a pretty crappy cover of tougher than the rest. The cd sounds like what it is and that is a struggling artists first (and what should be the last) cd. Don't be fooled by anyone who says this is remotely close to being good.
2,Entertainment?,"Having trained with FFL troops, I must say I was quite let down by this video. It was kind of boring and not really that intriquing. Found myself fighting off sleep more than anything else. A good video on FFL would be the World of Valor series which use to show on the Discovery channel. Who ever made this video needs to take some hints from the Discovery guys."
1,Wrongly described item,"The Amazon description for this item confuses two films on the Foreign Legion:1. 1950s British TV dramatic series, called ""Assignment Foreign Legion,"" on stories of individuals in the Fl, starring Merle Oberon;2. 1990s documentary on the training of FL soldier.I thought I was ordering #1 and got #2."
1,Fits small,"Did not like these shoes. They ran very small! The part of the sandal that comes up over the top of the foot extends halfway back the sandal. Feels too confining for a ""flip-flop."""
1,The Perpetual Curate,"Oh, heavens ... what a dull book. I took it to bed with me at night so that I would fall asleep!I am an avid reader, but it took way too long to finish this one. When I read the last page, I repremanded myself for wasting my time. The word ""dull"" does not even describe this very long book."
5,A must read.....,A must read for any and all surfers. This is a history book as well as a collection of surf adventures. Ever wonder what a monster wave feels like? These stories will send an occasional chill through your body with it's descriptions.
4,Starr Reporter,Brenda Starr was always one of my favorite comic strips in newspapers. So of course I have to have the movie also. Brooke Shields does a credible job and I always love Timothy Dalton. It's a fun movie not to be taken seriously.
3,Like a comic book come to life (in more ways than one),"It's like stepping into a Dick Tracy or Modesty Blaise comic. Speaking about Dick Tracy, it made me think of the Warren Beatty movie with that name, this movie has the same kind of 4-colour comic book atmosphere."
2,The movie just didn't do anything for me,This was a poor choice on my part. I liked the actors but not the story and I didn't even finish watching it.
3,Diana Scarwid steals the show!,"This movie is pretty much as awful as people say--but if you love that terrific, underrated actress Diana Scarwid (Mommie Dearest, Silkwood, Truman) as much as I do you won't be disappointed by her comedy performance as Brenda Starr's nemesis Libby Lips. Scarwid looks ten times more gorgeous than Sheilds and she definitely outclasses her as an actress. That garter belt scene is a classic!"
5,"An intelligent, honest approach","This book is a sophisticated look at one of the most common, unspoken and painful maladies experienced by women: self loathing. I totally disagree with the two reviews immediately prior to this one-- the book isn't about leaving your husband, nor is it about finding the perfect man. It is about rediscovering who you used to be, before you buried your authentic self under the expectations of others. Ban Breathnach is a wonderful storyteller, and in the context of those stories lies the clues we all need to find the person we are and the life we want. For my money, it's well worth the trip."
2,Left me looking for something more,"This book personally summoned me at the airport bookstore. As I began reading on the plane, I felt I was ready for my archelogical dig. Good concept, but it never went anywhere. I have an envelope full of pictures, what do I do with them??? Breathnach truly loves the written word, but too much of the book is reciting others works, without much original fodder. For instance, I read Black and Blue, it was quoted much to extensively. If books like this are calling out to you, try The Invitation, by Oriah Mountain Dreamer."
2,"Uninspiring, banal breathnach.","Sarah Ban Breathnach steals. Doesn't anyone remember that it was Emerson, and the Transcendentalist crowd who first coined and developed the term, ""Divine Discontent?"" Throughout her book, she seems to offer ideas or terms of expressions as if they spun organically and originially from her own mind. Ms. Breathnach offers many New-Agey type ideas that are either silly, or else you're sure to have read them years ago in women's magazines. She really needs to sit down, reflect, and truly come from an authentic place from within her own soul. What she says and how she says it doesn't ring true."
2,Very disappointing,"After Sarah's first book I expected something wonderful here, but was very disappointed. All of the peace and acceptance that the first book propels you to seek are missing here. Sarah seems too angry about her divorce to see straight. And when she tells the story about the married friend who was having an affair and told her about his mixed feelings she advised him (as if anyone should tell others what to do about these matters) that he MUST divorce his wife for her own good! Spare me friends like her!"
1,Yuck,"This book was a complete disappointment to me. The most disappointing thing was that it somewhat undermines what I loved about Simple Abundance. The concept of Gratitude was a major theme in that SA and it has had a profound impact on my life. This book is basically telling you that gratitude is not enough. Simple Abundance is one of my favorite books ever, and Something More is one of my LEAST favorite books ever. I don't know if I have ever felt such a dichotomy between books from the same author."
4,"Reader, Be Aware!","I'm fifty, been married 28 years and really enjoyed this book, but would not recommend it to others, expecially young married women. I suspect Sarah was working through her own divorce and there is a good one-third of the book that could be encouraging to others to leave their spouces. If you do read this book, glean from the stories of other women, but be careful."
1,Read SIMPLE ABUNDANCE instead.,"After reading SIMPLE ABUNDANCE, I expected SOMETHING MORE to be an enjoyable and soul-expanding sequel. Unfortunately, SM offered nothing new. Most of the book seems to be centered around divorce, marriage, and finding the perfect man. While this is a fine topic for books about love and romance, I expected SOMETHING MORE to have more to do with the individual reader and her relationship with herself. Since I have never been married, I found that the extensive sections about marriage and divorce did not relate to me. After reading SIMPLE ABUNDANCE, SOMETHING MORE seemed to be ""something less."""
5,Something More is Something Else!,"I love this book! It is a ""must read"" for every woman over 35 and every woman who has ever felt a yearning in her soul for something words can't express. I feel so strongly about this book that I am giving it to all my female relatives and friends for Christmas, so they too can begin to uncover the authentic self."
1,A BAD SEQUEL,"What happened to gratitude? Joy? Sadly, this book is full of anger, resentment, revenge and sadness. It is the OPPOSITE of Simple Abundance, which I LOVED. The author's divorce seems to have left her bitter and angry. Perhaps she should have healed before setting pen to paper."
1,"A waste of time, no real answers.","I was one click away from buying this book, but went to the library instead. Thank goodness! This book took pages and pages to say nothing. The title could have been ""All you need is a man to make you happy, but not the one you've got, dump him."" Had alot of crazy talk about reimbodiment that I found hard to take. Do yourself a favor, don't waste your time on this book."
5,This book helped me to find real joy!,This book provided me with real ways to find the joy in my life. I have been blessed in life and this book has shown me how to see my blessings and truly appreciate them. I now have a passion for living- even in the regular routines of life.
5,Compelling...,"Unlike many of the more recent reviewers here, I did not read ""Simple Abundance"" before I started the sequel. Also unlike many of the recent reviewers, I found ""Something More"" to be incredibly insightful, wonderfully written and a true gift FROM as well as TO the Soul.I found the life stories within this book to be beautifully encouraging and inspiring, rather than depressing and anger-filled as several have noted. Life is an adventure, fraught with disappointment and sadness, as well as all the other ""cozy"" feelings we seek and need. And I, for one, am glad she didn't pull any punches and told things just as they are.Excavating, searching, looking and definitely *finding* your Authentic Self takes a lot of courage. We all have it. THAT's what this book is all about and it gives us some concrete tools with which to do this. Thank you, Sarah, for daring to speak your Truth and helping so many of us along the way.Read it. You won't regret it if you listen to your heart along the way."
1,"Drivel, drivel, drivel!","Women of America, WAKE UP! If you want to find your soulmate, read Harville Hendrix's ""Getting the Love You Want."" Instead of dumping your husband, do the difficult and meaningful work required to become someone capable of intimacy. That's the only way you'll receive the love you so deeply crave. Ban Breathnach has it all wrong. Happiness in relationships is NOT about finding that one perfect man--it's about becoming that one perfect woman."
3,"A Big Swing From ""Simple Abundance"".","After having sold at least 50 copies everywhere I went in my initial praises of ""Simple Abundance"", I was quite disappointed at this book. After reading it, I personally knew of only one woman who would relate; a newly divorced woman with grown children. I sent her a copy and received a thank you note saying that the book was a life saver/changer for HER.Hmmm... So what happened? ""Simple Abundance"" appealed to me since it seemed to reach ""everywoman"". Tragically, it appears that the enormous success of that book changed the author's cozy life and ""Something More"" has a tinge of anger at her new solitary life.As such, I would recommend this book to single women or women with grown children searching for that ""something more"" - whether it be in career or relationships. But, if you are in the throes of a young family - you already have your ""more than enough"" and this book is not for you."
2,The first 100 pages says it all,"Ms.Breathnach's book is much ado about nothing. After 100 pages she has nothing new to say. I simply couldn't finish the final tribble. Her appproach is highly ego-centric and a dose of Dr. Laura would do her good. Happiness and fulfillment are more often measured by responsibility, fortitude, and joy in the life created. Not in the bodies of men less than our soul mates lining the path to our front door. Does she never speak to the children of wrecked marriages in the name of women finding themselves. I find women like this boorish and endlessly introspective. Yes, the spirit lies within, but the work of the spirit is in the small, dull,and monotonous events of everyday lives. Mine is full of joy and authenticity."
1,Glad I did'nt!,"After reading the reviews, I am glad I havent purchasedthe book!I loved SA and was hoping for a sequel. I think I'll try the library first!Keep the reviews coming they are wonderful!"
2,Something more,"I didn't read Simple Abundance but, as a new mom, read Something More in hopes of rediscovering a bit of myself I felt I lost after having a baby. I wasn't on a power trip, merely just hoping to keep to my true self while trying to be the best mother I can be. I agree with another reviewer that this book was simply one woman's bitterness and hoped-for recovery after a painful divorce. This was obviously written as a woman-power rant while dealing with creating a new life she felt she had been deprived. She made good points here and there but the overall feeling from the book tainted anything inspiring she may have had to impart. It left me feeling cheated. Could have been good but wasn't."
2,eh,"""Simple Abundance"" is the one. Don't waste your money, this is watered down and not helpful. not much inspiration found, glad i didn't have to pay for shipping"
5,Great,This is a great book. It really helped me look inside myself. I have recommended it to many of my clients and friends
4,A Beautiful Book of Self Awareness,"This book is a wonderful resource for me. The author incorporates knowledge from many different sources...it's spiritually refreshing. I also read and LOVED Simple Abundance. In Something More, Sara gives some wonderful exercises which bring much of what we ignore daily into a conscious awareness. This book gave me more tools to apply in my realization of who I am and what I truly want to leave in this life. I recommend it to any woman who is consciously living her path in life, and would appreciate ideas on how to understand herself and her experiences better. As with any book, there are some issues which don't pertain to me, but much of it is applicable to any human experience. Blessings, Tiffany"
4,Useful wisdom,"I agree with the earlier reviewer who praised inspiring books like ""The Triumph and the Glory"" but disagree over her opinion of Sarah Breathnach's wonderful books. They are inspiring as well, filled with valuable advice, offering help to many, many people who simply need a little counsel on getting the most out of themselves and life."
4,Use what is right for you,"I have read this book, in small bursts. I never read simple abundence, but have really enjoyed Something more... I didnt accept every little thing as gospel or right for me. But I did sit there and say yes this applies to me and i'm using this to look at another aspect of my soul. Its like advice....use what you can. I did, and loved that it gave me the insite to say ""So your scared... or intimidated... DO IT ANYWAY""."
5,A GREAT HELP TOWARD FINDING YOUR TRUE WAY IN LIFE,"I have read more than my fair share of self-help books and spiritual awakening texts, but this book struck a chord with me. I found the most effective way to use the book was to read it through first, then go back and slowly read and reflect on each chapter and work on her activities on the second go-round. If you feel lost and undirected in your life, this book may well help you gain a direction true to yourself. I highly recommend it."
1,A waste of time.,"I had hoped there would be some good ideas in this book. But dutifully reading along produced nothing more than page after page of ""this is going to be good, and we're going to start, and it's really going to be good, and we're really going to start, and it's really really going to be good and we're really really going to start..."" with pointless ""examples"" along the way.Then I realized that if I'm really going to do something with my life, I don't need a book to tell me how. And certainly not this complete waste of time."
4,"Somewhat ""Bitter Divorcee"" style...","Sarah Ban Breathnach is a fascinating author to read! This book is inspiring, peaceful and thoughtful. I do notice a bit of ""bitter divorcee"" in this book however. Which breaks the flow of the book, not as good as Simple Abundance. But worth reading and hanging onto for reference and inspiration."
3,Review for Something More: Excavating Your Authentic Self,I have just started reading this book. So far it is relevant to my life. The condition of the book was exactly as represented and the price was fantastic.
1,Not as good as Simple Abundance - save your money!,"I WAS REALLY DISAPPOINTED BY THIS BOOK. i adored Simple Abundance, but found this to just be a rehash of the first book. I cannot recommend it, and I gave Simple Abundance to about 50 people for Chirstmas."
1,Disappointing,"This book simply does not speak to the reader the way Simple Abundance does (a book that I adore and read every night before bed). To those who already have a full life and are doing the Simple Abundance exercises, this book seems tedious. It feels as though the author cranked out a book just to have another book.... sort of like she's talking ""at"" you instead of ""to"" you. In Simple Abundance, the author shared herself. In this book I'm not sure who she's sharing, but it does not have an authentic feel to it."
1,"Oprah, hon, you were wrong","After hearing the rave reviews Oprah gave SA, I decided to splurge on the hard copy. Reading the book, I was nothing short of disgusted. I felt swindled for paying so much for a book that was that bad.It seems as though some people loved SA and some people hated it. I hated it. Not only was it long-winded and packed full of annoying advice, reading it made me develop pure hatred for the peevish, whiny woman who could write such an attrosity.If you still aren't convinced, browse through it at the bookstore. Borrow it from the library or a friend with less sense. And if you find you like it, well then, you're a mystery to me."
2,Something More or Less of a Disappointment,"After seeing the author appear on Oprah and having read her previous book, Simple Abundance, I was prepared to thoroughly enjoy her new book. The premise of the book is excellent - one's restlessness generally bespeaks of life choices made - good and bad, consciously or unconsciously. Hoping that the author would widen the subject content to include more personal growth ideas, aside from finding your soul mate, I read the entire book, and was disappointed."
1,Surprisingly Disappointing,"I've never written an Amazon review, but this book compelled me to do so. I'm surprised that this book was published because its style and organization are so poor. The chapters are choppy, their arrangement makes no sense, and there is no cohesion. The self-excavation thread does not tie the book together as well as it might have, and the excavation journal project doesn't finish what it starts.Though some passages are interesting to read, the tone of this book leaves me feeling depressed rather than inspired. Is marriage such a bad thing? Do we give up ourselves completely in order to be married and raise a family? This book can suggest that, intentionally or not.Something More may be helpful to others or it may slightly resonate for me at a different time in my life, but I just don't agree with the view of life and relationships that it expresses. I was expecting something more positive, inspiring and helpful. Instead it leaves me unhappy an unnerved."
2,I was hoping for something more.,"I recently read Something More, and I still find myself wondering if I misunderstood the author's message. I came away feeling that in order to receive something more in your life you must expect nothing less than perfection from others. Obviously, this will never happen. I think it's crucial that you expect those in your life to give you their best, but they'll never be perfect. I also felt that she spent a lot of time conveying this message to women in particular. I understand that there are many women who don't have high standards when it comes to the men in their lives, but I think the author went overboard telling women to just sit back and let the man do all the giving. I personally think it should work both ways. There were a few parts in the book that struck a chord with me, so I can't say that the book was a waste of my time."
3,Enjoyable,"I should just say in defence of this book by the above reviewer that the error of Vivaldi's date of birth (quoted as 1762) is likely to be a simple typo, as the date (which should read 1962!) refers to when Vivaldi's true date of birth was REDISCOVERED in the 20th Century, as stated earlier in the book.I haven't quite finished this book but I find it very readable and sheds new light on the character of il Prete Rosso through his relationship with Venice. Enjoyable."
1,POS,What a piece of S**t.Switch is messed up.Tried to fix it to no avail.Wide beam is cool if the lite would turn on.Workes about 20% of the time.I finaly trashed it.
4,Essentials Elements,This product was used and was is pretty good shape. Some pages were folded but they could be straightened. Delievery was very fast. Over all I would order again and I would recommend to others.
2,Surprised,"The book is in good condition, the shipping was my problem. I grossly overpaid for expedited shipping. I shouldn't have. This book took me over 2 weeks to get to my door. Had I known it wasn't really ever going to get to me fast I never would have chosen this company. If you want it fast, forget about it."
3,"Good video, questionable content","I forgot how offensive MP can be! The video is good in quality but I'm not cut out for this kind of humor anymore, so I can't say that I loved it. I got it for the Cheese Shop skit though, and that was great."
4,Wish I'd invented them!,Great toy for comfort and fun on the computer. Kids will love that they can play with this toy online and sleep with it at night. What a genius idea -- wish I'd thought of it first!
5,Love the Lil Kinz,"Great product, took awhile to get it, and an email to the retailer went unanswered."
4,Fun for my 7 year old!,"The toy is cute, but every webkinz we've bought needs repaired...small holes in pretty much all of them. However, their website is amazing. There are a lot of educational things on it, it's easy to navigate, and teaches kids how to feed and play with their virtual pet, as well as gardening education and more! Fun Fun Fun!!"
5,Nourishes mind and spirit!,"This album of highly original music sounds great on the first listening, yet becomes even more interesting on every succeeding play; you never know what's ""around the next bend"", but it always works. Like a kaleidoscope producing an ever-changing combination of patterns and colors, Kevin's layering of voices, instruments and ""beat"" makes the music sound fresh and new every time you listen. His knitting of Native American voices, Gregorian chant, electronica, wind instruments, an occasional keyboard carrying a singable melody, and even echoes of the English choral tradition evokes an all-inclusive spirituality with an underpinning of anticipation and exhilaration. A real masterpiece!"
4,Very Good,"I am very pleased with this CD by Kevin Wood, got 2 of them, but before these I had never actually heard of him, they're both good."
5,Interesting and pleasant.,I'm no expert but there are all sorts of things going on here. The underlying theme would be mildly upbeat chant and I like it a lot.
3,Sacred,"I bought this cd based on the short preview of the songs but when I played the whole thing, it got pretty boring. There were a few songs that were really good - In Search of Kindred Spirits being one of them but mostly it sounded as if the same song was repeated over and over again with a different title to it. It might grow on me if I play it often enough but probably won't since there's others that I like better."
4,Excellent initiative,"Excellent initiative to record this great Tchaikovsky's opera. Very Russian indeed. This is not for the ""swan lake"" lovers. It is very serious and could be compared to Boris Godunov. A better version exists nevertheless, quite old that I had on vynil (Orlov 1948 ). I think this one is the only version on CD. The conductor is awesome!Martin Pitchon"
1,Complete Junk,I purchased this knife set on name recognition from Cuisinart because of their quality coffee makers and food processors. Unfortunately this quality did not carry over to their knife sets or their teflon pot and pan sets (horrible).Most knives in our set are chipped or broken and do not hold an edge. I contacted Cuisinart by e-mail with no reply...Do Not buy.
4,Pretty Good,"This is a good cleanser but I really don't think its worth the cost. It works well, gets rid of make-up and my face is really clean but I get the same results from items I can buy at the local Target or Wal-mart."
2,Extremely disappointing,I am a TVZ fan. I Typically buy his songs for long roadtrips. I count on him taking me into some dark and some bright places but always bringin me back ready for more. This CD sounded like he got roped into a committment. This is the very first TVZ CD that i was unable to listen to a single song start to finish; it left me jangled and frustrated but ready for the good ones.
3,"Works, but very unattractive.","I used these to organize my stereo/TV cables. The 1"" version I bought accommodates 4 sets of speaker cables, a sub-woofer speaker cable, and a subwoofer power cable. It was pretty easy to gather the cables into the tubing and break them out as I got to each component. You can use an ordinary pair of scissors to cut/trim the tubing.Unfortunately, it's really ugly. Though it doesn't look beautiful in the picture, it's even more unattractive when you see it in person. Of course that's just my opinion, but I think most will agree. I was afraid that would be the case, but I was desperate for a solution. This is MORE ugly than audio cables lying on the floor.The tube is pretty thin/cheap. I bet these cost about a quarter to make (think thickness/weight of a drinking straw).I think these would be fine to organize cables for your jam room setup, in your man cave, or in your shop, but for a nicer living area I would go with something else."
5,Works Well,The tube fits about 5 to 7 large wires and is easy to cut to length. The tube also comes with some plastic reusable ties which helps keep the tube from coming undone. That is if you are working with a lot of cables.Side note: It is easier if you unhook your cords before hand and put them inside the tube instead of trying to put the tube around the cords.
2,Not worth the money,"This is nothing more than vinyl hose that might be used on newer washing machines, split down the middle. Buy yourself some hose at Lowe's, along with five zip ties, and (Oila!) save some money.It is painful on the hands to insert the cables into the contraption, and once you bind it all together, it's not much more compact than at the start. I would have done beter using zip ties alone."
5,Taylor's Guide to perenials,I am very new to gardening and found this book very helpful. It is cut and dry! The plants are listed in alphabetical order explaining where to plant them and how to care for them. It also describes when and if to trim them back and if dead heading is needed. I also enjoyed how one section of the book organized plants based on color.
5,A Must Have for Gardeners,I have many helpful gardening books but this one is the one I always come back to. It's best for identitifying plants or finding the perfect plant for certain conditions. Great photos and lots of them!
3,"Yep, The Holes are Misaligned","Nice quality shelf to top off the bookcase but the holes are misaligned so there's no way to secure it to the bookcase without drilling more holes. I ended up lying it on top of the bookcase. It works, but they should do a better job of providing a top shelf with holes that are properly aligned with the bookcase."
2,"a problem of ""fit""","The plank of wood itself is fine and the look with the shelves is nice...kind of finishes the whole look. However, the black plastic inserts don't fit in the holes (i pounded and tried switching them etc.). So, after placing the plank on top of the shelf you can see the black nibs and the plank just sits on top of them.If you're not fussy, it's ok, but don't count on putting anything too heavy on the top shelf.."
2,Too unstable,I was very disappointed in the lack of sturdiness of this product. No matter how much I tighten it up it is still very unstable. I would not purchase this product again.
1,"Unable to attach the mantel to the bookcase, very frustrating","I just received this product and to my dismay, there are no pegs included to attach the mantel to the bookcase. I will be running around to Lowe's and Home Depot to find pegs that will do the job, but this is really disappointing. Clearly I should not have assumed that the shipment would include the pegs. If I can't, I'll have to return the product."
1,cheap Asian drek- doesn't fit,"Bought the bookcase and the top, sold separately- what a scam. The bookcase really isn't bad, but the top is just garbage, holes are poorly aligned; thing rocks like a ship at sea. I will probably return the top, but they grabbed an additional shipping cost, which is probably the reason they sold them separately.I am so tired of getting all this junk from Amazon that I could just move to the woods like Thoreau and buy a spinning wheel like Ghandi. My wife feels otherwise. She likes the bright lights.If you must store books, buy the bookcase. Skip the top. Throw out whatever you were planning to place on it. That's what I did."
3,Old Information,"While the information may have been excellent in 1998, the author refers to laws that would become effective in 2005. Here we are in 2011, which makes the information suspect for products available today. The techniques are well described, and the data is presented in an organized manner - making it very helpful for an initial familiarization with water-based finishes. The problem is the lack of current product data. Very disappointing for a book presented and sold as ""New"". As someone else described, it would be very helpful to have an updated version."
2,These dubs might be good but it's way better in japanese,"These episodes might be good dubbed, but the whole majin buu saga has the best episodes of DBZ. The whole DBZ saga is greater in japanese and since these are the best episodes you should watch it uncut in japanese, and that uncut sticker on the tape doesn't mean anything."
5,BEST DVD EVER!,"You've been waiting for the fight between Goku and Vegeta. This fight will NOT let you down. I never realized how cool Vegeta was until this moment, when he reveals his life and why he is the way he is. Great menu and songs."
5,Finally: The Battle of the Super Saiyans,"One word for this tape....EXCELLENT! This tape is a must have for any anime fan. The figthing is great as always, but this tape provided insight into the pain Vegeta has been carrying with him since he was abducted by Frieza as a child. As a 25yr old female fan, I greatly appreciated the depth of emotions the animators showed us in both Vegeta and Goku. Women everywhere will definitely love this one!"
4,A Leisurely Stroll through a Largely Overlooked Era,"Johnson's intriguing premise is that 1815-1830 were the years when the modern era blossomed, and he does a convincing and commendable job of telling us why this is so. One of the reasons why this fat volume is so enjoyable is that Johnson is in no hurry to tell his story. Unlike so many historians that focus only on the big picture, he delights in giving this era a personality by acquainting us with so many of its personalities, in remarkable detail. His scholarship is astonishing, and his story-telling arresting. Being a Brit, I think, gives him wonderful insight into the European characters whom he describes. Ultimately, his history is about real people--some great, others small, some we admire, others we despise--and that is what makes every page interesting. If you're in no hurry, this book is worth the stroll."
4,Paul Johnson's fascinating account of the yrs between 1815-,"The first Johnson book I had the great pleasure to read. It is a filled with wonderfully intriguing facts about the great inventors, musicians and minds of one of the most innovative and imaginative era's of history. Readers will learn about many interesting people and invevtions that are rarely covered by other historians."
1,Shockingly bigoted book,"I am astounded by the ways in which slick language and reductive thinking manage to impress some readers. The history here is elegant? Magisterial? Hardly. It is tendentious in the extreme. In particular, I was truly taken aback by Paul Johnson's bald bigotry against Latin Americans in his chapter ""Masques of Anarchy."" All his sources for this section--which professes to be about the Latin American wars of independence-- are either Spanish imperialist writers, apologists for the Inquisition, and/or disgruntled Englishmen. He sees ""Americanos"" as savage, ignorant, undisciplined, and bloodthirsty. He has the utmost disregard for their heroes. This is the most appalling masquerade of history I have ever read. I shudder to think that anyone would believe what is written here."
5,totally charming,"The harried mother in the background is delightful, fun for an adult to notice, while the foreground action is what's going on between the ""big boy"" and his baby brother - feeding the hungry baby toast & jam (and the look on the mother's face) was priceless. Another in this series of must-haves for the nursery-school book shelf."
4,Good book that helps a child through new-baby transition,"I liked the illustrations (when you read it, notice the mother's expressions...some are hilarious!), and the language was the right level for a small child. My daughter is two and loves it. My only beef was with the while bottle-feeding thing. I breastfeed my son, and this book certainly didn't help my daughter understand that because it portrays the baby being fed with a bottle. But, hey, you can't please everybody! Otherwise, a great book."
4,Fun sibling rivalry,My 2 1/2 year old loves this book. It has great pictures of a baby being annoying and then how the older brother can help the baby. My only quibble is that the first situation is resolved by feeding the baby a bottle. I wish our culture wasn't so full of bottle pushers when breastfeeding is also a great way to feed a baby!
1,Not our style,"This book depicts baby receiving a bottle, sleeping in a crib, watching TV, and eating toast and jam (?), all things which in our family we do not do. If you are a breast feeding, cosleeping, no-TV before age two family this is not the book for you. I also did not appreciate how baby does not like all kinds of things such as bath, stroller, etc. I feel this is a fairly negative book and am sorry I ordered it. Will now have to return it."
2,Leaf corbel,It took more than 2 weeks for me to receive this corbel. I don't think the seller carries this corbel by itself. Little damage on the buttom. Not sure if it was caused by the shipping.
3,Snow Blade,The Trico winter blade is good but not great for cleaning my windshield in the Minnesota snow. I have had better wipers for winter but these for the price are good.
2,"Should be titled ""Ballet for Instructors of Boys""","I purchased this video after reading a review in the NY Times. I had hoped that it would provide a slight balance to the many all girl dance videos that my 5-1/2 year old son (who is into dance, movement, theater, etc) has enjoyed. The video displays some interesting techniques for teaching ballet to boys that would be useful to dance teachers and probably teen boys who are just getting into dance. It is however, presented in a very dry form, and is quite different from ""I Want to be a Ballerina"" and the other entertaining ""intro to dance"" videos that are out there. It's not really suitable for most younger dancers."
3,Decent overview of the business for beginners,"Ellefson gives us a brief overview of how the music industry operates and gives us a few words of advice along the way. Given the amount of success he has achieved with his band Megadeth, he is a credible source. This book is targeted at the amateur musician, since the chapters on each section are usually limited to about 2 pages, which makes them very superficial. Those that have been performing/playing music for a while will most likely see this book as old news. Chances are you won't become successful by reading this book alone, but it's a good place to start & further reading on the subject will most likely also be required."
5,Old School Music,"Music from this day and time was from heart and soul. It had meaning and purpose. It told stories of life and times. I lived it and love it. Mr. Donny Hathaway had a special sound and what a unique, gifted voice and talent. The songs may be old, but will never lose their message and power. It's so sad that whatever troubled him, took his life so soon."
4,Love Me Some Donnie Hathaway!,"I didn't give this a 5 star rating because not all of the songs appealed to me. But Donnie has a smooth voice, and I love listening to him."
4,A good album that tries a bit too hard,"Donny HathawayExtension Of A Man(1973 Atlantic - Atlantic/Rhino CD 1993)I was certainly tempted to give this CD Five Stars, just to encourage the reader to buy it (as I think any music collection would be greatly enriched by having every album Donny Hathaway ever made). However, as beautiful as much of the album is, its obviously great intentions fail slightly in creating a cohesive whole. Nevertheless, the attempt at greatness more than deserves to be heard.This CD also includes a very fine bonus cut: ""Lord Help Me"" which is an excellent performance in its own right.I encourage you to read the customer review by ""Peace Brotha"" (another Four Star review found on this page) that goes into greater and better detail than this short review."
3,Varied,I love it. What else is there to say. I really give this cd a 5 star y'all. Donny was a very talented man.
5,So great! So joyful! So moving! So rockin'! So Donny!,"If there is such a thing as reincarnation, in my next life this will be one of the first albums I will look for. It feeds the soul in so many ways. A great investment."
1,Not water or even humidity resistant,"Never been near water, fogging up so bad I can't read the time. May be ok in the desert, not in Seattle."
1,Worthless Watch,"Don't buy this watch! Less than 6 weeks after I bought it, it stopped working. I had to pay $20 to Lucien Piccard to cover the warranty and return shipping. I then waited nearly 10 weeks, after which it was finally returned.It worked fine, until two days later. While swimming in a 5 foot pool--the watch description says very clearly 30 meters water resistant--it took in water and is now so fogged up it's not worth wearing.Lousy quality. Advertised at nearly $600, but I've seen/had better watches that cost $24! Obviously, LP Watch Group does not care much about their customers or their own name!Good luck"
2,NO WATER RESISTANT!!!!,"Do I buy this watch approximately 21 days ago and has it worked good, the bad side is that yesterday i was in a rain and when it arrives at my house does i look that it had water inside, Why? if in the description it says clearly that it is water resistant, but it is not it. I am very sad because such a simple thing as this throws to the trash an excellent clock."
3,Sub-optimal remastering,"As far as the song content, this collection is hard to beat, including lesser-known but great songs such as ""Light a Candle in the Chapel"", in addition to the ones we all know(""Walking Along"",""The Angels Sang"" etc.)However,I was very disappointed in the quality of the recording which leaves a lot to be desired.I will be looking for a similar collection of their songs with a superior remastering to add to my collection.A quality remastering will tremendously improve this collection.Hopefully this can be achieved so that others,both in and outside of the doo-wop circle can fully appreciate the greatness of this group."
2,outdated,"There are better options for ticketing option than this book. It is outdated and old fashion book, half of the book is just airlines codes, abbreviations flight itinerary and schedules."
4,Attractive and functional pepper grinder,"I bought this as a gift for my husband with the matching salt grinder. We've been through about two pepper grinders and they never seem to hold up over the long haul. With this one, I am hoping we will not need to make another purchase, and so far it is by far the best pepper grinder right from the start - you don't have to grind and grind and grind to get a decent amount of pepper out!The black wood is attractive and the size fits well in the hand. The only drawback, and this is minor, is that it was packaged just loose in the box, with only a small tag around the neck where I was hoping for perhaps a bit of documentation on how to care for it or what to do if it breaks (after all, this was not a cheapo pepper grinder)!"
3,Cherry? Really?,"I ordered both the pepper and salt mills for my wife for Christmas. For [...], I really expected more. The picture and description (i.e., ""Wild Cherry"") led me to believe these would look nice. They don't. The wood looks like cheap pine with a dark brown stain - nothing like the picture on the website. The top is nice, and they do grind o.k., but for $55 each, I was expecting a lot more. Pretty disappointing.Oh - one more thing I forgot to mention. They come in a plain unsealed plastic bag that was rolling around in the Amazon shipping box. I'm not big on superfluous packaging, but I would have expected a something a little more than just stuffed in a plastic bag. Not a good choice if you are buying for a gift...like me."
3,It's a peppermill...,"I misjudged the size on this, thought I was saving $30 by shopping online. Turns out the $80 one I wanted at the brick and mortar was actually a 12 or 14 incher...after shipping I basically paid the same price for this 8""+ model...my mistake. Definately an atractive P-mill, but still the old style screw top. I've since purchased the unicorn magnum pro which can do a half a teaspoon in 3 or 4 turns and this one has simply become decor..."
3,ok...,"i was using the battery for a few weeks and then i hand it in to my sister, she use it for her camera and works just fine,although the said life of the battery is not as accurate as it says.overall, its ok."
4,Worth the money,"This game, while similar to the other rampage titles, breaks up the repetition by changing the scenery every three levels and adding challenge games that are simple but addictive. The only thing I found a little detracting was that you cannot play without either friends or AI monsters. I like destroying a city by my lonesome."
3,Rampage,Good game and brought some memories. I was trying to have the whole rampage collection. This does play in the ps3.
2,Not as good as the sequal...,Rampage Through time isn't as good as universal tour.To make it short it's pretty much more of the same with nothing new. It really is a disapointment to its predecassor.ProsEh graphics are okConsGameplaygets boring after awhilefeels just like Rampage 1 and 2.To make it short this game is not worthy of a purchase maybe a rent but not a purchase. Stay far away from this one. It's fun for about 2 minutes but then gets old really fast...2.0 out 5....2 cause they had a pretty cool character but that's it...Lates
1,The Worst Book I Read in 2012,"Every year, I have a hard time choosing books for a ""best of"" list. There are so many good ones. This year, however, I won't have a hard time choosing a book for the ""worst of"" list. This one wins by a wide margin. How this could be highly critically acclaimed is beyond me.Is this the story of a man trying to connect to a distant father? Or the story of a man looking at how his life could have gone differently with a different woman? Or the story of how a man could connect with his own children? Do I care? Should you care? No. Don't waste your time on a novel that can't figure itself out."
1,Terrible,"Something to Be Desired is unreadable. The characters are pathetic, the language is too simple, etc."
2,"it's ok, not that good","i want to know what other people think, not write a review...i thouhgt it was suppose be about a father and his journey in life, but i need more than that, thank you, please help"
1,completely outdated!,"Contrary to the book description, this book is completely outdated! This was our first time and probably the last that we purchase a Fordor's book. For example, the entrance fee for Tulum was only 350 pesos. The book says 8 US dollars or 800 pesos. Chitchen-Itzas or any major Mexican landmark is free on all major holidays, but this information was not even mentioned. The local eatery was very difficult to find and we ended up have to ask the locals for the location. There is no suggested itinerary for each major destination or location. Frommer's Mexico is a much better choice."
4,really clever and cute,"This was a really clever and cute film. A bit dated today because of its reference to the issues of the old USSR. Clever, cute with beautiful locations nonetheless."
3,Does the job,"It's my first kitchen timer. It's reliable. Sometimes I find that if you accidentally activate it, it stays on for a while; I've had to take out the battery to get it to turn off at times. I wish it had a feature that told you how much time had expired since the timer went off."
3,3 out of 5,"Sound of the Blue Heart takes a lot of their sound right from the early David Bowie handbook. Though unlike Bowie, the group focuses a little more on guitar enhancements and runs. The smooth vocal melodies help drive home the somewhat tear-jerking and depressing tales of love and heartbreak."
4,very enjoyable first book,this writer's first book shows a lot of promise. I particularly delighted in the heroine's inability to stop talking when she was upset. This was so 'real'.I look forward to Drewy's next book. In a period where the Western seems to be overlooked it's good to see new fresh voice.
1,Rust after very little use,"I used this once as a bain marie holder for a 10"" spring form pan and immediately after doing so noticed rust marks in the pan. For $28 I'd expected a better quality. Surely one must be able to use water with it!"
5,Great Guide to Financial Freedom!,"Thanks to Bob Bly's books, and this one in particular, I've successfully made the transition from corporate attorney to freelance copywriter! Bob Bly gives step-by-step, easy to follow tips, instructions and ideas for building a successful writing business. Some authors discuss theory at length - not Bob Bly. He touches on theory only when it's critical to understanding the concept. Otherwise, he sticks with practical, 'here's what and how to do it' type of information. If you're considering a freelance writing career, don't pass up this book! /s/ Lynn Roberts, Attorney-turned-Writer"
4,Good advice on a wide variety of writing related topics,"This book is a compilation of previously published articles and covers a wide variety of topics such as: book proposals, technical writing, setting fees, speaking etc.I found a great many golden nuggets of information in these pages. I'd recommend this book for all those who would like to get a good taste of the breadth of Bob's wisdom.As others have mentioned, the binding is not the best, but I was gentle with the book while reading it, and didn't have any pages fall out. Even with the binding issue, I consider this a worthwhile investment."
2,finally got the cd and ewww!,"in the 2 months since i wrote the previous review, i have packed my bags, crossed the pacific, and am now living in san francisco...just a bridge away from top's hometown of oakland. i finally got myself a copy of ""monster on a leash."" (from the $3.95 clearance bin of rasputin records!) it sucks. couldn't hold a candle to any of top's records from the 70's. yet i still couldn't stop playing the song ""you can't fall up."" and tho i still love top, i can't recommend you shelling out any money for this clunker. stick to the older stuff."
5,Funk At Its Best,"This album is fantastic. Full of more hooks then a fisherman's tackle box. If you're in the mood for mostly feel good horn music, pick this album up!"
2,Not their finest hour...,"Great band, lame record. ""A Little Knowledge"" is good in an eighties kind of way...certainly a far cry from the funk TOP is known for. And ""Personal Possession"" is still strangely compelling - but again, not really representative of the Oakland Stroke. The bottom of the heap is ""Funk the Dumb Stuff"", which has lyrics that remind me of bad Run-DMC. And no Lenny Pickett sax solos...buy ""Soul Vaccination"" instead."
2,"OH NO, ITS ICE CREAM MUSIC","21/2 SCOOPS OUT OF FIVE. OBVIOUSLY SOME VERY TALENTED PLAYERS HERE, SOME MOMENTS OF COMPLEXITY HERE AND THERE, BUT THE MATERIAL IS POOPY. FOR MY PERSONAL TATSE, THIS WOULD GET A BIG FAT LONELY STAR, BUT IT'S NOT REALLY BAD MUSIC, I JUST COULD NOT GET IT. THE PRODUCTION IS TYPICAL OF EARLY 90'S, WAY OVERDONE, SHINY, ARTIFICIAL, THERE'S NO PROPER SPACIAL IMAGERY AT ALL. CAN YOU SAY COMPRESSION? YUCK. NOT THE GREASY, SWEATY FUNK FROM THE 70'S. MADE ME THINK OF BEING IN AN ICE CREAM PARLOR AT TIMES. WERE THESE TRACKS LEFTOVERS FROM BAD 1989-90 SESSIONS OR WHAT?"
5,"PORTER CABLE 10"" Sliding Compound Miter Saw","nicname: Flip, I found this saw to be of exceptional quality.I had alot of good saws to choose from and it was a toss up between this and the Bosch.The Dewalt is a great saw also but the blades are much to expensive if you plan on doing alot of cutting.The blade that comes on the saw is fine for semi finish work but you'll want to invest in a better blade preferably 80teeth and above for fine finish work.The only thing I found wrong was that the extra blade that was sent is for a table saw not a sliding compound miter(different hook on the teeth of the blade). I think whom ever purchases this saw won't regret it.Happy saw dust. :) feel free to drop a line or two"
1,Am I Missing Something?,"I must be missing something. I returned this saw without ever using it. My problem was with the pre-set miter settings. When I placed the saw into one of these settings, there was about a degree and a half of play in the table. I read the literature that came with the saw for instructions that may instruct on how to remove this play, but found nothing. I couldn't believe the saw would be designed that way. I ended up calling a Porter Cable service center for guidance, and sure enough, they informed me that this model was designed to have play in the pre-set miters. The saw was back in the box and returned immediately. I still can't believe it and still believe I was missing something. I'm getting the Makita instead."
4,Nice Overhead Projector,"My daughter wanted an overhead projector for her birthday; she loves to play school. This one is nice, not too large. It worked great for a few days and then stopped working. It was only the bulb but it cost us about $22 for a new one. The company wouldn't reimburse us, but they did send us out another replacement bulb right away."
4,Looking overhead,"I bought this projecter to replace one that was stolen from me. It was a little hard to put together, but seems to work pretty well."
2,Apollo 3000 Lumen Overhead Projector,"My problem with this projector is how the arm folds for storage. On the previous Apollo model I had, the arm folded neatly without interfereing with storage. The are on the 3000 does not fold away well for storage."
3,It works - but it is an old stock with watermarked,It works - but it is an old stock with watermarkedinserts/warranty card and around the edges of theoverhead view glass panel.
5,Breyer has done it again!,We have two Belgian horses on our farm and this Breyer looks exactly like one of them. She is incredibly detailed down to the shape of her hooves. Any serious Breyer collector needs this mare in their collection!
2,"Nice, but flimsy.","Many of the Pet supply stores have reviews on this product, and I can confirm that this newer series seems made of much thinner plastic. They look nice, but simply don't carry weight very well. This one was purchased for a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel, a 20 pound dog. If you carry it with the handle and the dog in the crate, it will flex to the point where I fear the door will fly open. I really wish they would stop cutting costs and make these from thicker material again. It would be well worth another $10 to protect a pet you love and don't want hurt."
1,Don't waste your money,"These used to be nice and all I would purchase for my puppies. I am a breeder and crate train my puppies and used these crates for shipping (if needed) The last Petmate crate I purchased, I assembled, got it labeled and all ready to ship a puppy and the handle busted off. Thank God it happened here at home and I had time to purchase another brand. Save your money and get something else."
1,"CHEAP, FLIMSY, KNOCK-OFF QUALITY","We have 3 PREVIOUSLY PURCHASED Petmate Deluxe Vari Kennels and they are solid, well constructed, and of excellent quality. The one my husband just ordered on Amazon was extremely flimsy, poorly constructed, has inadequate closure clips of top to bottom, has stiff and insecure latching system, and is a hideous lime green (think 1970s) instead of the moss green as described. I wouldn't trust this to securely keep a 2 pound dog safe and secure. Frankly, this looks, feels, and functions like a cheap knockoff. Returning this immediately - could not possibly be more disappointed with the poor quality of workmanship, materials, or function. And the hideous color was just icing on the cake! Would rate it ZERO STARS if that were an option."
1,Dismal Quality,"This product is SO markedly different from the couple-years-old Vari Kennel Jr. we already own - which is fantastic and motivated me to purchase another one - that it is difficult to believe they are the same brand. Our first Vari Kennel Jr. is made of rigid plastic that does not flex and has a sturdy handle. It is a quality carrier that we feel confident would keep our cat safe.In contrast, the Vari Kennel we just received is flimsy, flexes easily and I could break the handle off if I gave it a hearty twist. In NO way would I feel comfortable putting a beloved pet in there and I would be foolish to believe it would protect her.If you are a responsible pet owner that loves your animal, look elsewhere."
5,Sturdy and easy to assemble,"I inherited a 17 pound cat and a crummy, old plastic carrier with a plastic door, ick. I had to shoestring it together to hold it for transit to my house. I replaced it with this one. Super simple to assemble, I added strip ties as I don't plan on disassembling, ever.Fast shipping, great packaging, and plenty of room for a fatso catso."
4,Petmate Deluxe Review by Me,Great buy for around $20 and only being used a few times a year that breaks down into three pieces for easy storage. Locks work well. The only bad thing is that unlocking/locking the front gate could be more smooth. Overall very satisfied compared to the 2-3x's more you'll pay at any pet store. Perfect for when I bought two rabbits and brought them home.
5,Pet Carrier,"For the price, can't beat. Sturdy, spacious, with a good locking device on door. Totally worked for the job I purchased it for."
1,Horrible way to learn the blues.,"I bought this title as a teaching tool for a beginner, but I wouldn't give it to a beginner it would just fustrate them. The style of the book it terrible and the teaching methods are the worst I've ever seen. It isn't a good way to learn to play the blues."
1,Beginner?,"I bought this book with the thought that it was for beginner's (never judge a book by it's cover). Whoever put this book together did not put themself in the readers shoes. Example on the bottom of page 2 ""Brush down with thumb on each cord or slash, or slash...Brush down twice with the thumb on each cord or slash, for a ""ba-bump, ba-bump"" rhythm"".What the hay is a slash? I as an intermediate player have no clue. There is not even an introduction in this book. I tried to play along with the CD and was left in the dust on the first song.The whole book is the same three or four songs over and over and over and over again, but it's only 48 pages. A rip off to put it mildly. Take my advice, save your money and never buy Mel Bay products."
1,not good,The info on Amazon says says 25W. Not on the box. The strobe light says 14W and so does the label on the box. Thought the light looked dim. Now I know why. The model number on the label on the generic looking box says model S-81.
1,Garbage,"I bought this product today, brand new, at Best Buy. When I tried to use it, I got absolutely no signal on all channels (and I live in Los Angeles, so you'd think there wouldn't be a problem with the signal), and the channel buttons themselves were not functional. It also made a high pitched sound while turned on. Reading the instruction manual was pretty entertaining, though, as it is written in poorly translated English.In short...don't buy this."
3,FYI - TRACK LIST INCORRECT!,"I just received this item and there are 16 tracks on each disc, not 18. The discs do NOT have:All I Wanna Do (Sheryl Crow)Baby One More Time (Britney Spears)I Want It That Way (Backstreet Boys)Killing Me Softley (Fugees)My Heart Will Go On (Celine Dion)Ray of Light (Madonna)IT DOES HAVE ALL THE OTHERS LISTED, PLUS:If I Had $1,000,000 (Barenaked Ladies)Kryptonite (3 Doors Down)"
3,Opinion for Al Martino CD,"I like everything Al Martino does and I liked all the songs on this CD but was disappointed in the sound, which seemed not as clear or as good as some of his other CDs I have. the song selections were what I wanted but wish the sound quality was better."
5,Absolutely love it,"We use this to cook veggies and smaller meat items like shrimp on our grill/smoker. It's heavy duty made, super easy to clean, and the food doesn't fall through it. It also heats evenly which is great. Going to get another to keep in with our camping supplies.Only con is to be careful of the edges and corners as they are rather sharp."
1,A lie,Advertised size is not true! It is advertised as 13.6 x 2.6 x 14.2 inches. It is 12 x12 like all the others. I already had a 12 x12. I was looking for one larger.
1,Not Dishwasher Safe as Advertised,"The Amazon.com review states ""dishwasher-safe"" but the package clearly states to ""wash and dry by hand only."" I'm giving it one star because I specifically ordered it because it was supposed to be dishwasher safe. Let's hope it doesn't rust on me."
5,The Love Collection-We Love You,"This CD is a nice companion piece to Diana Ross's latest studio album, ""I Love You"" and in a sense both of the works serve as bookends to her career, thus far. It is fitting that the collection starts with I'm Gonna Make You Love me recorded with the group's brother act the Temptations. Their version of Baby I Need Your Loving is joyous and will have you dancing along. For the more romantically inclined listen to the covers of Unchained Melody and My Funny Valentine. To experience Diana's growth as an artist compare What The World Needs Now to her solo version on her album A Very Special Season. Included here is their first U.S. Top 40 Hit When The Lovelight Starts Shining Through His Eyes, and the first of ten hits to include ""love"" in the title. Also from that era you will enjoy hearing Baby Love; Come See About Me, Back In My Arms Again, My World Is Empty Without You and No Matter What Sign You Are. Let's hope there will be a second volume to this collection!"
1,Don't Bother,"Generally underwhelming cd does includes plenty of pictures - many of which are poor quality scans lifted from old Mustang brochures. The majority of these photos are available on various Mustang club web sites, free of charge. Other photos are more recent shots of privately-owned, older Mustangs (most of them from New Jersey). The typical Mustang enthusiast won't be impressed by this cd. A better choice would be any number of good coffe table books on Mustangs with good, clear photos and more illuminating text."
3,almost an amazing deal,"I bought a set of sabatier knives from Amazon for about 30 bucks about three months ago. While they are worth that amount, the suggested retail price of something over $300 was VERY misleading. I paid for what I got, but not much more. They cut OK and they have worked fine for a person who uses them about once every blue moon, but to suggest they are quality knives at an unbelievable price is false advertising. I have always been happy with Amazon, and I wonder on what grounds they are able to make such a claim. Additionally, the set I was sent was missing a knife, but not worth the hastle to return in order to receive another set in its entirity. Sp, buy them if you want cheap knives...cheaply...don't if you're looking for a killer deal."
1,"Dennis, Mister Mom.","I bought a Sabatier knife set just like this last year, DIFFERENT HANDLES AND LOWER PRICE. The only thing good was the wooden storage block. They were dull and rust at the drop of a hat, even in the dishwasher. A better deal is to kick out a few more bucks and buy a real set. SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!"
2,look good but not fun to use,these look good but dont stay sharp very long. my wife would give it a worse review. I've had it for 6+ years and it still lasts without rust so its not terrible.
4,Good product,The honing steel needs to be larger. This could have been a 5 star if the steel had been larger
2,"Not sure what it does, besides No Harm","I use a number of Murad products from the Redness Therapy line daily. I have red, sensitive, 40+ and (usually) oily skin. Of all the Murad products I use, this is my least favorite, and I don't think I'll replace it when I use it up. I'm not sure what it actually does in my skincare routine! It does feel soothing, like all Murad products do for me, but besides that it just seems like an extra layer. If I use too much it might peel off later in the day (under the SPF 15 Correcting Moisturizer). It does have a nice light scent and seems to do no harm, I just don't know why I need it. To be honest, I do not use the powder in the Redness Therapy line, which is recommended and partner to this product I think. There's a limit to how many products I can handle in my routine. Correcting Moisturizer SPF 15 does it all for me!"
2,Not worth the $$$$,I purchased this at the local Sephora store and used it everyday. I have very senstivie skin and rosacea. This did not do one thing for it at all. I still suffer from redness and it doesn't seem to matter if I use this product or not. The redness is still there. Save your money.
5,GREAT PRODUCT!!!,THESE MURAD PRODUCTS ARE WONDERFUL!!!! I WILL BE RETURNING. THEY ARE GREAT FOR MY RED FACE WHICH IS NO LONGER RED THANKS TO MURAD!!!
2,Horror lite based on an Indian myth,"Joe Shelby, a project engineer from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, pulls a poll out of the water and frees an ancient Indian legend. Brass is a shape-shifter with a gambling problem. So off go a bunch of rag-tag heros to track this creature down and put him back where he belongs. Conley offers a large portion of the tale from the ""monsters"" point of view. In fact, he's just a bit misunderstood. A large typeface fills up 310 pages, of what seems more like a novella. Conley's narrative was reminiscent of one of Kipling's ""Just-So"" stories. There really isn't much meat to any of these characters, and by the time it gets interesting it's over. It's a great idea there just doesn't deliver much. BRASS is a quick read that is good enough to take your mind of the trials and tribulations of the daily commute. It an age of ""lite"" beer and cigarettes, BRASS should be nominated as the first ""lite"" horror novel."
4,"Pulp, indeed!","Lovely, classless, 'B' movie, over-the-top pulp horror. In short, I loved it. Conley joins the ranks of gifted new authors such as Harry Shannon (Night of the Beast) who are trying desperetely to revitalize the horror genre by turning back the clock to the kinds of books we all used to know and love as kids. He deserves to be read, and I hope more books follow."
5,Cordless Grease Gun,I purchased the Lincoln Cordless Grease Gun from Amazon.Com for my husband. He had been looking for the gun and had not found it for this low price. He was very satisfied and will definitely shop at Amazon.Com again.Mary Norris
1,Almost fooled !!!,"I tested The Perfect Sommelier with friends and at first we thought this gadget actually worked. After testing it some more, we realized that what ""worked"" was leaving a wine bottle open during 30 minutes before drinking it. After researching this further on the net, we found out that there is a natural process called oxydation which works on wines and makes them age super fast once you open the bottle. Regarding the Perfect Sommelier, we could NOT witness any improvements with its use. So, my advice would be to air out your bottles of wine before drinking them and to save yourself some money on this one."
1,Buy a decanter instead,"I am a chef and Sommelier in NYC where every gadget comes down the pike as either a gimmick or a time saver. This product was disappointing at best. I bought a tannic California Cab as a test and after a half an hour (in a Riedel Glass), there was next to no difference in the strident and pronounced chalkiness of the tannins. After an hour, the wine lost some of the vanilla characteristics of the oak, but maybe that was an ""Emperor's New Clothes"" phenomenon because I really wanted this to work. I returned it (Amazon still has the best customer service) for a newer decanter."
5,This pan is a dream,"I looked at a few of these pans before I opted for this one. Many are made with metal that may rust on you with use. Personally when I buy a pan, I like for it to stick around for quite awhile. This pan will do just that. It is nonstick, and has a surface that will release well when you make your tarts. Very good quality, with years of service to look forward to."
5,Beautiful Pan!,I could not believe the quality of this pan! I even cut on it and it did not damage it! An all around great pan!!!!
4,"good, but not blue","I really thought these were blue/cooler spectrum white light, but they are a tad whiter then my stock Sylvannia 9007 headlights. Got it on the Jetta, it is hard press to notice the different if they are more efficient then base line model. The Stock Sylvannia were a little yellower, these are a yellow too, but a tad whiter.They fitted and works fine."
2,"Quality, not really.","The vertical part of this stand is typical of Chinese built stands like it, but the boom attachment is very poor. Instead of screwing on the vertical tube, it is clamped on in such a way as to distroy the vertical tube threads over time."
5,Folding Magnifier,I absolutely love this thing! I use it all the time both at home and work. I would not want to be without it. The carrying case is nice too!
4,Very nice product,"I liked the fact that it can fold (so it is portable) and it comes with a carrying case. I wish it would be better if it were little bit bigger. Overall, it was a satisfying purchase."
3,Folding Magnifier,"Overall good item, large enough for easing viewing yet compact enough for storage/carrying. Only negative is that when opened it doesn't stay open and flops down so it has to be held up with your fingers."
2,Not What I Thought and Didn't Work For Me,"Do not buy this if you have a bath tub covered in tiles. The suction cups will not stick to it. Also, this is not inflatable so it is not very thick. It has some/very little stuffing, but it is not the comfortable cushion I was expecting. I really don't know why you would buy this. Only if you want a flatter bath cushion."
3,"eh, ok","I haven't used this item much since we got it. It wasn't as cushioned as I expected and it was difficult to remove from the tub when cleaning. If you don't have expectations about it's softness and don't mind a tug of war when having to clean under it, I guess it is ok?!"
5,The original in music satire.,Spike Jones and group have entertained generations with their musical satire. They are as fresh today as they were decades ago.
2,Piracy?,"I bought a copy of this DVD from Amazon and I have the impression that it is a pirate copy. The sound is very bad and the DVD itself looks like a copy made at home. Even the label in the box is of poor quality, so you better look for this elsewhere, but not at Amazon."
2,"kinda entertaining, but not great","Reminds me of a Cirque du Soleil show in Vegas, but nowhere near as good. Musicians will wince when they watch & hear Roni play, he just isnt a very good guitar player,If you want a great Nouveau Flamenco dvd, this isnt it, I wouldnt even call it Nouveau Flamenco, try Strunz and Farah, Jesse Cook or Del Castillo, all incredible!I see people say this is flamenco, Benise is flamenco music about as much as Pink Floyd is Hip Hop, real flamenco is Manitas De Plata, Sabicas, Melchor De Marchena, Carlos Montoya etc & today's great master Paco De Lucia not this!"
5,Stab stab stab,"I bought one of these for my nephew's bar set, and one for myself. I have had immense pleasure stabbing olives, fruit, and cheese wedges with this little sword set. The food was no match for me and my swords of justice, I fight for the rights of stomachs everywhere.But, on to the product review:The picks are sturdy, a wonderful conversation piece, and all around a great value. They will surely last for years. I highly recommend."
2,Poor QC,"It doesn't matter how good the material is used in the construction of the saw if it will not perform as it is intended to do after its assembly. When Bob Schwab and CjAcosta brought it to our attention that the table is not level side to side I checked mine that I received for Christmas. They were right on target; 1/2 of the right side of the right table is tapered nearly 1/8"" downward. I've checked 2 more at a local Lowes and neither of them were level. The left side and table in each case is level, the right sides are the problem and each in varying degrees of level.I'll continue till I find one that is perfect.I initally had a problem with the sliding fence binding but with some filing relieved that. Since we are being charged for a product that is supposed to be perfect we should accept nothing less. If we keep sending them back, perhaps PC will correct their faults."
1,Unusable,"I bought this saw and when I took it out of box, it was horribly adjusted. In fact I could not get the turntable of the saw to adjust to the base. This caused the wood to sit unlevel during a cut and I never could get a decent cut from it. PC help line was no help and the local contact would not be able to even look at it for 4 weeks. I took it back and swapped it for a DeWalt simular model."
3,NICE SAW BUT.....,"I bought the Porter cable because no other saw came close to the quality and accesories... It is a well made saw with 2 exceptions. 1) The infeed and outfeed tables are not level to the cutting table, I called Porter cable and they explained to me there is a .025 lower elevation on the tables to prevent kick back. It is noticable and I tested it was 1 degree off on a cut if you clamp to the left table. I intend to shim the table up with some slick tabe to level them out. 2) it is very heavy."
5,Good Feeling,"That's the feel of this saw. It is stable and smooth in all operations. The fence,table, guard and bevel functions are all just solid. It is well-balanced, and sits firmly on a 2x4 base you can build in about 5 minutes.It cuts smooth and fast, and was perfectly aligned out of the box.I would buy another without hesitation."
2,Not enough basic information for first time users,"Although well stocked with information, the quality of information ranges from too basic in some cases to too difficult in others. The book makes assumptions as to the reader's knowledge of home repairs to begin with, and then becomes too confusing if those assumptions are not true."
2,Glosses over too many subjects,"This book does not go into depth enough about each project. It does not list alternative methods of achieving the same results. For the price of the book, I expected a lot more to be covered. Skip this and go to the Time Life series."
3,not good enough,"I have used this book to help with tiling, door hanging and trim work. I find that there are many gaps in the information that it contains. Some of these gaps in knowledge lead to big mistakes in projects."
3,"Capitalizing on the Home Depot brand, but...","While this tome of home repair isn't an *awful* reference work, the cover design says it all: let's sell lots of copies of an otherwise forgettable book by plastering it with a well-known logo. Maybe we'll get the attention of novice home improvers desperately seeking a familar name.To be fair, I was clearly one of those folks, or I wouldn't have bought it!Bottom line: it's OK, but you'd do better thumbing through some others in a library or bookstore to find on you *really* like."
4,A great reference book,I go back to this book with almost all of my home improvement projects. The book could use a little more detail in some areas but overall it is just the thing you need when you don't know or can't quite remember how to do something.
4,got sometin to say,"first of all this box set is outstanding but I wanted to say to all you noob lynyrd skynyrd fans out there that lynyrd skynyrd is a band not 1 person you idiots (calvin ""tony""). the lead singer of lynyrd skynyrd is ronnie van zandt. thats all this box set is great!!"
5,The Best of the South- Period!,"I like the fact that this box set includes their biggest hits and includes its share of rarities (like the original demo of ""Free Bird"" back in 1970 and the alternative take of ""What's Your Name""). I'm glad they included ""The Ballad of Curtis Lowe"", one of my favorite all-time Skynyrd songs! Also includes lots of live material from their 1976 tour. The booklet is generous with photos and insights on the band. Skynyrd is my all-time favorite Southern rock band since just about everything they did (while Ronnie Van Zant and Steve and Cassie Gaines were still alive) is worth having. There's no other band of that genre that I could recommend all their original albums. Fortunately, nothing from their 1991 ""reunion"" album is included!"
3,Get the original albums first,"The Lynyrd Skynyrd box set suffers from the schizophrenia many box sets do - it doesn't know whether to cater to the serious or casual fan. It contains lots of hits that all serious fans already have, but it leaves off several key tracks in favor of ""alternate takes"" or ""demos"" that pale in comparison the fiery released versions. If you are a true fanatic, go ahead. If you are a more casual fan, get the band's first five albums (all recently remastered), ""Pronounced"", ""Second"", ""Nuthin'"", ""Gimme"", and ""Street"". These five discs by the original band show Skynyrd not to be the hick boogie band of popular lore (Freeeee Biirrd!), but instead a group of talented musicians with an original and - yes - southern point of view. Not that there's anything wrong with that... By the way, most of the other ""best of"" CDs suffer from the same problem as the box."
5,an excellent overview of one of the greatest rock bands,this box set is simply fantastic as you get all the classic songs of this great southern rock band for 48 bucks.this sontains some rarites and demos which you wont get in their regular albums.get this with one more from the road and allman brothers at fillmore east to start your southern rock collection.very highly recommended.
5,So Satisfying!,"A must for any Skynyrd fanatic. Combines the new with the old in a tasty and satisfying banquet of good old Southern Rock n' Roll. The multiple (and some previously not released) ""Free Bird"" experiences are unlike any you have heard. Put these disks in the player, settle in with a tall cool drink and enjoy Summer like the boys from 'Bama showed you how."
4,A Great Box Set,"This box set is excellent. It contains many rarities like the original demo of ""Freebird"". The song ""He's Alive"" is an awesome song, and there are many rare live songs on the CD's as well. There's only one problem that I have with this box set, which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5:To me, a box set should include the band's entire collection. I've always felt that that's the whole point of a box set. Like CCR's box set; it contains all of their albums plus an entire CD of songs they did before they became famous. I can understand it not including stuff from the albums that the band made after the crash (They should make a separate box set with all of those albums). But it should contain every song from Pronounced, Second Helping, Nuthin' Fancy, Gimme Back My Bullets, and Street Survivors. I think Street Survivors is the only complete album on the box set.But other than this flaw, this box set is excellent!!!!"
4,And this Bird you cannot change......,"This boxed set is a wonderful tribute to those""Boys from Jacksonville"".All the soaring guitars of Gary Rossington,Allen Collins,Steve Gaines,and Ed King(from the early years),the passionate,sometimes searing vocals of Ronnie Van Zandt,the steady pulse of Artimus Pyle,s drums and the bass licks of Leon Wilkeson not to mention the nimble,Honkey-Tonk piano&keyboards of Billy Powell are here,timeless treasures for the die-hard Skynyrd fan. Also,several previously unrealeased demos such as ""Free Bird"",and""""Four Walls of Raiford""and a booklet telling some of Skynyrds history make this set a must have for the money.This music sounds as good today as it did 25 yrs. ago, when that tragic plane crash took some of them home....."
5,The Definitive Lynyrd Skynyrd Anthology,"This three-CD/three-cassette boxed set is the definitive Lynyrd Skynyrd anthology. It starts off with early demos, which is a little disheartening, then moves through the classic albums, rightfully including seven songs each off of SECOND HELPING and STREET SURVIVORS, both of which you must own as their own entities. Even if you own all of the band's original albums, the surviving members' advocacies of sanctions against countries which convict foreign tourists for trumped-up crimes, capital punishment for kidnappers, increased funding for law enforcement, and major federal crackdowns on polygamy, privately-run ""boot camps"" for troubled youth, and programs and schools affiliated with Scientology (e.g. Mace-Kingsley Ranch School), make this boxed set, with all of its rarities, an essential purchase for both your ears AND your conscience."
5,Great Box Set!,"This is a tremendous compilation that any true Skynyrd fan, or not, will enjoy and love to have in their collection. Pick it up!"
3,It could be better,"I'm glad I was able to purchase at a great discount since this backsplash is narrower(29 7/8"")than the stove and did not include any mounting screws which surprised me. Manufacturer's product description could be more accurate. I expected it to be as wide as a standard sized 30"" range."
2,Poor Shipping and Handling,"I ordered this panel only to have it arrive irreparably bent at two corners. I returned it for a full refund and will seek out another backsplash. The product itself ""is what it is"" - a simple piece of stainless steel. The finish looked fine, but those wanting a sophisticated look at low expense will not find it here. The panel will require trimming along the edges to blend it in to surrounding cabinetry. Mounting will also require your own set of screws (and difficult to match the finish) and would entail using liquid nails to make sure the panel remains flush to the wall between stove top and cabinet bottom. Any warping will leave a gap between the wall and the panel."
3,"Not really 30"" wide!","What a bummer! This backsplash is NOT 30"" wide, it's smaller, so you can see the wall on each side of the backsplash after installation. Luckily, I dry fit it first and discovered this, so I was able to return it to the store where I bought it. It should come with some kind of molding or trim to cover this, otherwise it looks ridiculous. Other than that, the item was a nice and inexpensive solution."
4,DIY Stainless steel backsplash,"I purchased a few of these sheets while I was redoing my kitchen. Since I did not want to use tiles again (and I am not the most handly of people) I decided it would be best and easiest to use these sheets. The sheets work perfectly. I used the mounting holes but I also used LiquidNails to get it on the wall. I had to use a dremmel to cut out outlet holes. The steel is rather thick and not cheap, it will use one dremmel ring per outlet hole. Stainless looks great, make sure you take the white plastic off as that is the steel side.If you are looking to do a stainless backsplash the easy way, this is the way to do it. I will add pictures shortly."
3,decent,"I had to return the 1st one. Product seems to have ""machine"" scratches on it. The second one was better, so I decided to keep it, but it isn't perfect, as you would expect it to be. Amazon is amazing in its cooperation!"
4,Great book for the whole family,This book was very interesting and informative. A must for any library.
1,Piece of Trash,I bought this unit brand new 5 months ago. It quit working after 3 months. AKAI has done nothing but give me the run-around. You would be nuts to buy this or any other product from this manufacturer!
5,Best One Yet!,"I have tried many sunless tanning creams, and I prefer this one the best. I have been using Zia Sunless Tanner for the past 8 years, and I love it. I recommend exfoliating your face prior to using it and applying two nickle-size amounts all over your face, neck, and ears evenly, at least an hour apart. I put the lotion in the middle of my palm, and spread and rub it evenly on both my palms, then smooth all over my face neck, and, ears. The next morning, I shower and lightly exfoliate again. I have a fresh, glowing color that is not fake-looking. I have found that skipping a couple of days here & there help keep the healthy color fresh. Good luck! I think you will love it!"
3,Heavy metal,I like this wok because it makes my life easier. It is heavy weight stainless steel. I rated it three stars because one end of one handle came loose.
3,"It's easy, so do not expect a lot from it.","""Schaum's easy outline:organic chemistry"" is a packbackable book that is affordable for your budget. However, as it is an outline, it only functions as a guideline: briefly contains the very main topics in organic chemistry. My reccomendation is to use this book as a guide only because your organic textbook (whatever it is, mine is Brown and Foote's Organic Chemistry) has more details and good explanations."
2,"not suitable to non-chem/bio major, some chapters not well written","i just finished reading the book. overall speaking this book, as is named, easy outline, give the essential part to the reader. however, i do not satisfy about the match of the figure with text description. say, on the DNA section, there is no remarks on which is base and which is sugar. i have no background at all and so it is very difficult for me to follow. the last chapter is the most important one to me, but worstly written.chapters after 10 are not well written. some wrong figure. less instruction, less background especially to me, not a chem major, i could not follow. i have to rely on several other O-chem book to get me through.the book is ok, perhaps to chem/bio major people. but need to be more thoughtful, and taking care with new O-chem reader (say common non-chem/bio student)."
1,"Apparently ""Fix It"" indicates that unit will need fixing.","Despite charging the flashlight for the required 15 hours, the light failed to shine for more than 5 minutes. Also during those lackluster minutes of operation, the emanating light seemed to be nowhere near the advertised 1 million candle power."
1,15 hours of charging for 30 minutes of light...,"Small print on box: Charging the spotlight takes approximately 15 hours using the AC charger adapter, and approximately 12-20 hours using the 12V car adapter. The spotlight/lantern cannot be used while charging. A full charge will provide for approximately 30 minutes of power.30 MINUTES after charging for 15 HOURS? What the heck is the point of this flashlight?"
1,WARNING DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM,I BOUGHT THIS ITEM A FEW WEEKS BEFORE HURRICANE WILMA HIT SOUTH FLORIDA... I KEPT IT CHARGED FOR 2 WEEKS WITHOUT USING IT AT ALL...AFTER THE STORM HIT AND I TRIED TO USE IT THAT NIGHT... THE SPOTLIGHT STAYED ON FOR ONLY 20 MINS TOPS BEFORE IT TOTALLY RAN OUT OF POWER LUCKILY THE CAR CHARGER WAS IN THE BOX AND THE LANTERN LIGHT WORKED VERY WELL ON A FULL CHARGE...BUT I DO NOT GIVE PRAISE TO THIS ITEM AT ALL AND I GAVE IT THE CREDIT IT DESERVED THE 1 STAR IS FOR THE LANTERN AND NOT THE SPOTLIGHT...CRAPPY AT BEST...PLEASE DO NOT BUY
3,The Book of Enoch The Prophet,"This Book is full of mystical revelations; however, the font is so small that it strains the eyes to read.Great knowledge, but need to be presented with more consideration for all who might invest in it."
2,A repeat of Revelations but more scrambled,I bought the book for my daughter because she had mentioned that she thought it would have some insights on the blessing of God. She was intreagred by Enoch being taken up by God? I did not find any of the things she was interested in finding in the book.
4,Enoch,A little confusing but interesting. I can understand why this book did not make it into the Canon. There was one point where the writer refers to Enoch as his grandfather and that gets a little confusing so I wonder if the book is actually a family compilation. It did help as an extension of Bereshit 6 in regards to the fallen angels and the Nephilim. But otherwise did not add a lot to my knowledge of other events. I would not take it as literally as I do the authorized scriptures.
3,the book of enoch the profit,I found this book informative but only learned from the last approximately 10 pages. Unless one is into astronomy and studies the stars the rest of the book is not for the basic popoulation who knows nothing about the stars. I have read before that the stars show everything that has happened and what will happen except for this time period. and this book just confirmed that.
5,Frames were just what we needed.,Great product great price. The frames were just what we needed at work. These are getting more difficult to find and this was perfect.
5,Best book available on mentalism...a rare find!,"Learn not only the strongest types of mental act, but also the basics of performance, showmanship and presentation. This includes booking the act and keeping it booked! Hundreds of tips are given that only years of experience could produce.Described in detail is a complete mental act for two people. It offers one of the most complete, practical verbal codes developed. This is and act that can be done anywhere, at any time, with no special props, stage equipment or paraphernalia.A separate code sheet is included for easy reference. Every phase of developing and improving yourself as a mentalist is covered."
5,Best Songs From One CD,"The Best Of The Manhattan Transfer is the one collection that lives up to it name! The mainstream songs/hits like ""Boy From New York City"", ""Spice Of Life"", and ""Twilight Zone/Twilight Tone"" are included along with other notable gems ""Birdland"" (a well-constructed and enjoyable song) and ""Tuxedo Junction"" (a swing-era favorite).The liner notes provide a brief history of how the group began and how the lovely voice of Cheryl Bentyne was able to replace Laurel Masse and changed the sound of the band. The are also pictures and discography along with song credits.Overall, this collection is ideal for both the casual fan (who only wants the hits) and for the Transfer fan (who would approve this collection as a truly single CD anthology of the group). Recommended."
4,Love this band and this collection,"The only thing keeping this CD from getting 5 stars it that it is missing ""Chanson d'Amour"" - other wise a very complete collection of all my fav tunes from Manhanttan Transfer."
1,Piece of GARBAGE,"I bought this product about 2 weeks ago with high hopes. All i have to say about this product is that its complete garbage!!! the mounting system is meant to break, thus relying on 2 tiny zip ties. The directions are very vague in regards to mounting/positioning and programming the receiver. Plain and simple, this product is not well crafted, its cheap, and the only reading i got from it was the temperature. I DO NOT recommend this product to anyone, so please think twice about buying it. The most satisfaction i got from this unit was by smashing it."
1,Awful Product,"A terrible product. Poor instructions, with even poorer illustrations. Sensor and magnet don't work well together--sometimes it registers movement, sometimes not. Computer mode/set functions faulty. Avoid it at all costs."
1,Impractical design,"I was not able to align the sensor and the magnet within 2 mm per the set up instructions. I returned the product. The design of this product was impractical for my bike - impractical for most bikes, I suspect."
1,Not wireless,"I ordered the wireless bike comp from this exact page and they sent me a white wired model...dont order it here, its a hassle so go find a ""wireless"" version of planet bike somewhere else"
5,BikePlanet Wireless Computer,"So far, this is an outstanding product from an outstanding company. I have several of their products and Bike Planet really knows what they are doing. This computer is fairly small for being wireless and it installs quite easily. I have been using it rigorously and I have had no problems with it as of yet. As far as the issue when it shuts off because of rain, I have not encountered that. Overall, I love this product and would hands down recommend it to anyone looking for a wireless cycling computer."
5,great multi-function gadget,"I bought this multi-function wireless bike speedometer for my son as a gift. He loves it, and is impressed that it has far more functions on it than he ever expected. Great gadget for an excellent price!"
2,Almost there,"I wouldn't recommend this product for one reason: The unit does not turn on and start recording distance from the motion of the wheel alone, you have to press the unit to turn it on before it begins recording. This leads to a lot of missed miles being recorded!Everything else I like though - lots of info on a big display, temperature, etc., so it may still fit your needs."
4,Worth the money,"I really enjoy using my Protege 9.0. It looks good on the bike and it's very easy to use. Instructions could be a little more clear, but overall a good value for the money."
1,It worked well for two months - dead in four!,I purchased this in February but only rode a few days with it - winter in Wisconsin is not conducive to February biking. March it worked well for about 10 rides; then started to lose track of my speed - it would drift from 16 mph to 5 mph with no change in my cadence or speed. Then it just stopped tracking speed and mileage; clock and thermometer still worked. The materials are very cheap; and constant adjustment was necessary to get this thing working only intermittently. Very disappointed with the quality and the performance of this unit. The distance restrictions from the wireless wheel monitor to the handle bar display unit was also very restrictive. I threw this in the basket..that worked better than this unit ever did! PlanetBike! Up your quality cause you just lost another customer.
1,"Don't Buy, POS","This product did not work right out of the box:(As soon as I clipped the computer into the holder, it would turn off and all settings would be erased. The holder was extremely tight. I think it put pressure on the battery and the power would be lost.I agree with a previous reviewer; whoever design this unit should be ashamed of themselves."
2,"Nice computer, poor computer mount design","The computer looks great, but the computer mount won't fit on my bike. I have a tri bike and just purchased this computer. I was surprised to find the mount is NOT adjustable to fit on the stem of my tri bike where other manufacturers' products do adjust (CatEye, Sigma, etc). To put this on my bike would require me to purchase an additional $12 part - if I knew this I'd have purchased a different computer obviously. Called the manufacturer and there is nothing they can do - they suggested the additional $12 part, which by the way is from a different manufacturer."
5,Great product; very accurate!,"I do 30 to 40 miles of bike riding on the weekends and I wanted a bike computer that could track my time, distance and speed. This product works wonderfully and it was not hard to set up. I like that I can see all the stats without having to reach down and scroll through screens. It is accurate and a good buy!"
3,Great and Affordable Bike Computer (Lasted one year though),"Great bike computer. I like that all the important data is display at once. The only thing I can complain is that it is a bit difficult to remove the computer from the bracket.Update: It only lasted a year. I did not put it through water or anything. I took good care of it. One day started given incorrect or no values for the speed. I replaced the battery and that did not work. Anyways, switched to a wired cateye. I think that the wireless circuit was what failed in the planet bike. Do not recommend to buy it."
2,Worked fine for a while,"I was really happy with this for about a year. The display is great, it was pretty easy to install, and worked fine for about a year which for me was about 1,000 miles. Then it started reading part of the time and finally not at all. I replaced both batteries and re-installed them a couple of times to make sure they were seated correctly, adjusted the distance of the magnet to the sensor, the sensor to the computer, reread the manual, and everything else I could think of. I finally gave up and tossed it out. I may have missed something, but am mostly assuming it just quit working."
3,Expected better,"Trip mileage has been unreliable from the first ride, average speed arrow also unreliable. Other functions work fine, but you expect better when you pay more than an entry-level price."
5,Works great. All info on one screen.,"Works great once you position the sensor extremely close and align the magnet just right.Really like all the data on one screen. I am getting familiar with he layout and after a few more hours ride, it should be second nature where each data point is displayed.The sensor on the fork is rather large but - and this was a very nice surprise - it can easily be unscrewed with a thumbscrew from the setting for those really challenging trails. Replacing it only requires you to pop it back in and twist the screw. Neat.Good buy."
4,"Value for Money, but some oddities","Reasonably priced, good performance. Recommended to anyone . . . some quirks:(1) My unit does not turn on just by motion of the wheel. It must be switched on before recording mileage, etc. A minor hassle, and maybe even a flaw in my unit.(2) Freewheeling tire can record weird speeds, i.e., 99.4 MPH. Keep the computer off if the bike wheel is not on the ground.(3) Certain locations in our city have radio frequency interference that makes the unit go haywire for a few seconds.I REALLY like that if you record your mileage on a piece of paper, then switch out the battery, you can restore the original mileage recording rather than having the odometer completely reset. Smart.As for the thermometer, it appears to be accurate -- so if you park in direct sun in the summer the temp WILL read 110F. Also, temps three or four feet off the ground, on hot days riding on black pavement, will be higher than your basic weather service reading."
1,Disappointed,"Purchased two of these in December 09, one for the road bike and one for the mountain bike. Installed one on the mountain bike, setup the device for the appropriate wheel size, took it out for a spin - wild differences between it and the GPS I carried. Speed was sometimes three times more than the GPS unit, other times it was close, but more often wildly higher than the GPS. Going up a 15% grade it read I was traveling 9mph when the GPS read 3.9mph. At first thought it might be the front shocks possibly causing the problem, locked them out, still the same problem. Re-calibrated the unit by using the wheel length method, same problem existed. Transferred the unit to the road bike, same situation with the wild readings. Both units are going back to Amazon for a refund. Wish they worked, as I prefer not to have wires hanging and strapped to either bike. Will stick with the GPS unit solely until I find a reliable product."
1,STAY AWAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"The engineering group who design this product should be ashamed of themselves.It did not work out of the box, the instruction completely useless (starts the fireplace though), It's a complete hit and miss. Just look at the distribution of reviews. Either 5 or 1. It's a Russian roulette.If you don't know what do with your money, buy this product. You may have luck with it."
1,Does the computer really snap off??,"After having installed this gadget, we tried to snap off the computer and there is NO way it comes off. What is one supposed to do?"
1,low quality,Same problem with random accumulation of milage when parked and the wireless sensor died after a bit more than a year. Nice display but with such a low quality product you buy nothing but junk. I will stay away from Planet bike products from now on.
5,it works great,i used this for the first time in my triathlon and it worked great for the price. I was very happy with it.
4,"Good Product, Awful Installation Instructions","First off, let me say that I really like the product and how it functions on my bike. Easy to read, easy to reset, reads distances to .01 miles and the temperature display is a nice added feature. That said, the installation instructions were at best unhelpful or just plain wrong regarding the installation of the fork-mounted sensor / sender. I ended up at the local bike shop to get it installed. I have installed many computers myself in the past and this was the most difficult."
5,Love it!!!,"Easy to install on the bike. Does well with tracking my mileage, speed, and average speed. Easy to use and no wires needed. A great buy!"
5,This is great!,"This product is great! I've been using it for a while and the simplicity of clicking the computer forward to view the different modes is ingenious. After all, you can't be messing with buttons when your riding at 18-30 mph. The numbers are big, so its very easy to see the information. Overall, I am very happy with this item."
2,avoid this product,This product was not made well. It had a tendency to come off the handlebar mount too easily. In fact it fell off on several occasions. It ultimately broke after several months. I would not recommend this product.
1,Did not even work,"Much too often I buy an electronic item on Amazon that doesn't work. This is no exception as the ""set"" button does not function. I cannot program the computer, so it's yet, another return hassle."
4,Nice Computer,"This computer is simple and useful. It is easy to set up as well. It is nice to see all the information you want to know at once. It is a little big, but that is not a big deal."
4,great product. easy install - easy to use,"My only complaint is that the display had a ding in the screen when it was delivered, so I should have returned it but was too impatient to wait for another delivery so I kept it. No regrets it still works great."
5,Most Readable Wireless Bike Computer,First of all the Planet Bike Protege 9.0 Wireless 9-Function bike computer is by far the easiest to read and to use thanks to its' large screen. Secondly it is by far the most reasonbly priced unit on the market!
5,Excellent bike computer,I bought the Planet Bike computer on the strength of recommendations of other Amazon users and am well satisfied. The numbers are large enough for me to read without requiring a change from bike sunglasses to my trifocals (a big plus) and having the information I want without toggeling between screens is an added bonus. It was easily installed on the bike and worked perfectly the first try.
5,Planet Bike Protege Computer,"This is by FAR the VERY best bike computer on the market today. It displays 6 functions including temperature, which is very accurate. It is very well made and easy to read. Don't even think about any other bike computer."
5,Planet Bike Protege 9.0 Wireless Computer,"I searched for a while to find a bike computer with temperature and a display that wasn't tiny. I can appreciate the look of a small profile on a bike, but when riding, I want to be able to actually read the display quickly. I was afraid it would be too big - it is the PERFECT size. I tend to keep it set on the display that shows speed, time, temp and elapsed trip time. Just what I want to know when I'm on my way to work and home. I could not be more pleased with this purchase, and now when I pass by the Cat-Eye computers in the store, I laugh and I'm so glad I bought the Planet Bike model instead. A bonus was the reasonable price."
3,Excellent but.....,"This is the second unit I bought, now for my son and his new bike, I bought mine about a year ago, excellent the measurements in Kms, very accurate, sometimes la temperature vary, if the sun is directly over it doesn't show the exact temp, just how hot the sun is over him. The bad thing is that is not waterproof, last weekend a hole bunch of rain fell over me, the numbers start to disappear from the screen and then all the data was erase, it took me about two day with the hair blower to dry the computer and see if it works again.I recommend this product, but try not to use it in bad weather conditions, otherwise, put some plastic bag on it so won't happen that all data is erase.Fernando Rosabal"
5,Great value and a great computer,"Have put about 250 miles on it this spring. All the comments about the thermometer are correct; I just subtract about 10 degrees in the bright sun and pretend it's accurate. It took a while to get the feel of toggling through the features, but now it's easy. I'm concerned it's going to slide off once it has a little more wear, so I may have to figure out how to impede the pull of gravity. It looks great on the bike.I paid $20 through Amazon plus shipping - you can't go wrong.I just learned today that you have to keep the sensor clean. I picked up some dirt somehow and it was only reading 7mph when I was going around 20 or 25 mph. I spat on it and rubbed it off and it worked great."
2,"worked well for a while, and then it got hot and humid","I used this cyclocomputer through the spring, with great success. but as soon as the weather turned hotter, and more humid. the thing was awful. it resets itself all the time, even when i simply detach it from the handlebar mount. I have reset it more often over the last 4 weeks, than i have used it. sometimes, I have to reset it 3 or 4 times before i give up and go without. I am going to go back to the cateye's. i hope it works better."
4,"Don't often review, but this is a great product.","Easy installation. Clear instructions. And once it's installed, huge display with logical design. It's not winter now (yeah) but I see why they designed ""change modes"" to work with a push of the entire unit forward -- it can be done with big gloves on (heck I could do it with my elbow). And I can read it on the road, even with my bad eyes.My only knock is I replaced a Cateye (new version got lousy reviews!), which had a nice screw-down clamp for installation on the fork. Why skimp and make me install with tie clips? Come on -- charge me an extra $2 and give me a bolted-on clamp. That said, still a great unit."
4,Hard to install but cool once it working,Getting the sensors lined up just right from the wheel and the fork is a bit of a challenge. Once it was set it worked for a while and then had to had to be reset. A bit touchy to say the least. I love this think when it is working though and it gives all the info you will need in the road.
1,poor quality,The arm designed to hold the skewers in place broke immediately and we didn't get to use it even once.
2,Nice idea,"The concept of this is wonderful. The skewers were easy to use, but there were no directions on how it fits together. It was easy to turn the kabobs, but on the second turn it broke and everything fell out. It was a huge mess."
2,Way too heavy and thick!,"I was thinking this is a nice look watch with a cheap price. Well, that has its reason. I couldn't find the thickness information from the watch-intro before I bought it here. When I received it, I was disappointed. Please don't cheat your customers like this, that makes me don't want to try any product made from Croton anymore. Because of the weight, it hurts my wrist every single time I ""tried"" to wear it. Now, it'll sit in the box till I throw it out."
1,Rust easily,"These pans were the right size for mini meat loafs, but when I took them out of the dishwasher, I noticed rust in the corners."
5,The HITS just keep on coming!!!,"Richard Marx has shown the world again, that he belongs at the top of the songwriting industry. When it was announced months ago a record was in the works, I was anxious for its release. His announcement that the CD might alienate old fans with an edgier dark tone brought some worry. Well just goes to show, when someone knows what they're doing, we should all just trust them. There are no weaknesses or flaws on this album. From the heights of the hymn, ""Ready to Fly"", to the dark yet poignant tone of, ""Fallen"", Marx doesn't disappoint old fans and will most certainly gain new admirers. My only afterthought that may be critical was the inclusion of an 'oldie, ""Someone Special"", from his 2000-2001 release ""Days in Avalon"", Iwould have chosen almost any other song off that album. Nonetheless, Mr. Marx my hat is off to you, just do me one favor; Don't make me wait too long for the next group of lyrical masterpieces, Thanks!!!"
5,his best work,"he has done it again, this is some great work, thanks richard for coming back. it was worth the long wait"
3,Not much voice left,"There's no doubt that Richard Marx has written some of the most memorable songs in the pop repertoire. I don't dispute this. I also believe Mr. Marx used to possess one of the most versatile, powerful and beautiful voices being recorded. I find it incredulous that so many of the other reviewers are still applauding his raw and raspy voice with words of phrases such as ""pure,"" stronger than ever or that his voice is only getting better with age. It produces the same anger I feel when listening to later Joni Mitchell. She can now barely force enough air through her larynx to make a recognizable note. They're also similar in their attempts to convince themselves that their current instruments are better. Richard Marx's voice used to be pure and powerful when singing an up-tempo song or pure and gentle when singing a love ballad. It's just so frustrating that artists with incredible voices are not taking care and are sacrificing their beautiful sounds."
5,he's still got it,"I knew I had to buy this album as soon as I heard I'm Ready to Fly, and I wasn't disappointed. Richard Marx has always amazed me with his vocal talent as well as his ability to create moving lyrics and melodies. Every song on this album sends a message and i will definitely listen to this album over and over again. I'm ready to fly is by far my favorite song to date by Richard marx right up there with Hold on To the Night and Right Here waiting. A must have for all Richard Marx fans."
3,Good CD,If you are looking for a good cd to play in your car or in your computer. This would be the one for you. If you don't know anything about him. Then your best bet is to buy Richard Marx greatest Hits. If you are in your 40's you will enjoy it.This cd comes close to that 80's sound.
5,"""Laugh till you collapse""","This is the best collection of songs! My girlfriend and I bought this and listened to it for over 2 hours straight on a roadtrip and literally laughed the ENTIRE time. Tracks 3 & 10 are the best. Had we not been strapped into a moving vehicle, we would have collapsed on the floor! And by the way, we are both over 30! My husband and kids love it too. Highly recommended!"
5,Great for kids and adults,We love the cd on Animaniacs. Loved the cartoon as well. It is a fun cd to listen to with your children.
5,Animaniacs Original Soundtrack,I love this CD! I had it when I was younger & lost it.I was so excited to see the Amazon sells them.Thank you so much for bringing back a memory for me.
4,james,"Bought this CD along with a VHS and my kids loved it! It's really too bad they quit doing the show,I now have to get the other CD which I will for a birthday! Makes a great kid entertainer while traveling!"
5,Great fun for Children and Adults Alike,"This soundtrack is a wonderful collection of songs from the hit animated TV series from Warner Bros. and Steven Spielberg. Funny, entertaintaining, and educational, these catchy and often exceedingly clever numbers are sure to put a smile on your face, whether you're 8 or 88.""Yakko's World"" and ""Wakko's America"" alone are worth the price of the disc and are sure to become favorites among both the big and little ones in your family. Adults will be amused by the pop culture references and whimsical, yet intelligent lyrics of each song, while kids will get off on the catchy tunes, and playful attitudes of the voice actors from the series.Whether you're a fan of the show or a casual listener, ""Animaniacs"" is a great CD collection for all ages!Highly Recommended."
4,"Clever, Fun and Entertaining","I was never a great fan of the Animaniacs on TV. A friend of mine and I were walking past a Warner Brothers Store in London in 1994 and they played Wacko's Fifty States and their Capitals and I just cracked up laughing. I have been trying to get it ever since. It is worth buying this CD for that one song alone, other notables being All the countries of the world and the Universe. In closing I would like to request and suggest one thing .... RELEASE THIS ON DVD!"
2,Amzon Customor,This is defently one of the uglyer Breyer horses I've seen.Flicka was a palmino and this one looks like a chesnut.It is very durable though. But if your looking for a very durable horse and fun to play with and educational and actually looks like the horse I would check out Hidalgo.
2,review,I consider this a poor choice for a suction gun. It was one of the most expensive suction guns that Amazon offered so I expected it to be one of the best. It has good suction but when you pull the plunger to the top it squirts the liquid that you were using it for for all over you. If you buy one of these expect to get squirted in the face. I will try one of the less expensive ones to see if it works better.
1,nothing to see here,"Once again Alpha Video has resorted to using masterings that range from so-so to terrible for these public-domain cartoons. Some of the color cartoons show horrendous digital artifacting and are all really soft. If you care about picture quality at all, this disk is just wasted space on your shelf."
1,At $7.98 it's $7.00 overpriced,"The cartoons are interesting for their historical and cultural value, but the poor quality of the images cannot be excused. If there was any attempt at restoration it is not in evidence."
2,"BIZARRE , YES..... BUT.....","This set of cartoons is billed as ""Bizarre"" , and while they probably can be thought of as bizarre, that doesn't make them ""Good"". I was not impressed. I like cartoons of all kinds, old, new, feature films and short cartoons, you name it..., but this was barely average. I enjoyed one ( The Pincushion Man) out of the fifteen cartoons on this DVD. This set may be entertaining for young kids , but if you are looking for something creative and quirky from the past, there are better offerings than this.- Mike S."
3,Old musical cartoons from the past....,If music is in your heart...you should enjoy these old cartoons fromthe past.
4,Pioneering book on pro-gay theology,"Pioneering book that gives the ""inhospitality"" argument for Sodom (1955), Boswell uses this argument (1980). He (Bailey) could be called the father of pro-gay biblical revisionists. An important book on the subject.Chapters:Introduction1. Sodom and Gomorrah2. The bible and homosexual practice3. Roman law to the time of Justinian4. Legislation, teaching, and opinion in the church5. The mediaeval situation6. The law in England7. Conclusion"
5,Works great,"This controller is great. Since you can't use DMX with some of the lower end strobes, this controller will substitute very well. I was hesitant at first, but I'm glad I got this."
1,It's too flimsy and clumsy to work,"I was so excited to buy this for my Mom who has arthritis.She said that she couldn't get it to work, but I figured that it was just because of her arthritis ... but it's not. I don't have arthritis and I couldn't get it to work either. It's just too flimsy and too clumsy. In order to slice cheese you have to put in something like a 1 inch by 1 inch square and then it sorta lobs off pieces .. very impractical!"
2,This is not KitchenAid quality,"Don't be fooled by this apparently well-designed grater. The hinge is weak and will break. The grater looks and feels great, but don't expect it to last."
1,Does KitchenAid know this grater is mediocre?,"I received this grater as a Christmas gift, and the following August it broke. I stripped the plastic screw that holds the handle to the grating barrel. And all I did was unscrew it for cleaning! If these reviews don't get your attention, let the amount of plastic on this grater send up red flags. Why would the part receiving so much torque ever be made of plastic?!? I am curious to see how KitchenAid will handle my complaint, since I can't find this product anywhere on their website, and a search for it comes up empty. Not a good sign..."
1,Bad design.,"This grater worked ok for a few weeks, but then the crank borke off. I thought maybe I just got a bad one and bought another, but after a month or so, the crank broke off."
2,"Great Grater, and then...","This thing worked like a champ, impressed friends, and lasted all of 6 months...and then, the plastic screw that attaches the handle to the grating drum snapped. Cheap, Cheap, Cheap! and at $20/per...definately not considered disposable! Look elsewhere. The Zyliss will be my next purchase and I will leave feedback."
1,MISLEADING PRODUCT DESCRIPTION,"My daughter just received this item as I gift that I sent to her. I told her it came with 3 different Blades/Graters. She said it onlycame packaged with one! I read the small print, and if you get it through ""C & M Medical / Fragrance"" that theirs only comes with ONE!I did not see that small fine print unfortunately in advance before ordering. Amazon shows pictures and describes the 3 different blades!DON'T BE DUPED INTO BUYING IT FROM ""C & M "" !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Shame on you Amazon, for associating yourself and recommending purchasingthrough this company! This is FALSE advertising, if you ask me!I told my daughter to send it back!!!!!!"
1,Flimsy plastic.,"This grater is not able to grate hard cheeses, like Parmesan, without extreme difficulty. The problem is in the design. You cannot apply adequate pressure to the cheese because the plastic is flexible and the pressure point is not directly over the cheese. This is a horrible product. I threw mine away (didn't even want to Goodwill it). I bought what I had before, a Zyliss Classic Cheese Grater ($15 at Amazon at time of writing)."
1,Cannot believe KA put their name on this piece of junk,Way too flimsy. It feels like it is going to break in your hands.
2,Handle breaks off and is then worthless,"If you apply a good amount of pressure while grating the handle will snap, so if you buy this to add to your fabulous collection - BE GENTLE WITH IT- so it will last, same thing with the egg slicer, the wires will break unless you are gentle."
1,Don't Buy - Very Poor Design,I was so excited to buy this little grater from reputed brand like KitchenAid. But believe me this is one of the worst grater I have bought in my life. Even a dollar store carries a better grater. Here are the shortcomings I see1. Very poor and unthoughtful impractical design. I can see this after using this regularly for more than a month and tossing it in to trash.2. Blades to grate are not sharp enough hence grating is not efficient.3. Residual large chunks (left overs) of whatever you grate.4. Very difficult to clean completely.5. Lot of force required in this manual grater.I don't recommend this grater to anyone. Better invest your money on something else.
3,Flimsy. Crank Broke. Great Replacement Warranty,"First the bad news. Product is flimsy, requires dexterity to use. Have to clamp down hard on handle to hold cheese down while turning the crank. Especially difficult on hard cheeses. After moderate use, crank handle, made of plastic, broke at the thread.Now the good news. Called Kitchenaid customer service, told them of my problem and they promised to send a new unit, no questions asked other than where the break occurred."
1,Forget it,"I admit, I have grater phobia -- I'm afraid of slicing off my skin when I grate with a old-fashioned grater. So I thought I had hit jackpot when I found this at my local Ross store. Hah! I tried to grate 1/8th of an onion (sans skin) and it couldn't even perform. Nothing came out; the onion was 'too tough' for the wimpy grating slots. Most of the onion stayed trapped under the holder even though I had already applied all the pressure that I could garner with my left hand on the holder. It might grate something soft like cheese but I won't bother trying. Good thing I saved my receipt; it's going back to the store. The search for a grater will continue ..."
1,Flimsey Plastic Garbage!!!,"DON'T BUY IT!Read what the other reviewers are saying and heed their advice. 20+ people do NOT like this product for a REASON. My review is below.Like everything else emanating from China these days, this product has had the durability engineered OUT of it. The Stainless Steel that it SHOULD be constructed with has been replaced by cheap, plastic GARBAGE. The money you THINK you will save by buying this unit is illusory. The plastic handle will soon crack near the drum, and then break off. This is assuming, of course, that the knob for the crank handle remains attached which is a questionable proposition on this product."
5,Great product but a little expensive.,"Well it works like advertised, installs pretty easily and is in dead anti-glare and appears (after two weeks) to hold on pretty good. Overall pretty satisfied with the product."
5,Steve Jobs and Apple Computer.,"For anyone interested in the early personal computer market and it's history, this is a blast from the 80s and 90s. The interview covers the early years of apple quite well. I would like to see another interview of Steve Jobs in the later years before Steve's death. Maybe someone has just such an interview or documentary in mind!"
4,Very good interview,Excellent Interview. Really gives you some excellent insight on what was going on inside his head in the early days.
5,Inspiring and insightful,What an inspiring interview. Mr. Jobs articulated very well on where John Sculley failed and what the essence of running an innovative technology company is. Enjoyed it totally. I happened to watch the 1990 interview on Youtube (free) after this one and noticed Mr. Jobs reused some of the materials in this 1995 interview. I guess he did better after the 1990 practice :-)
5,Insightful & strangely captivating,Things that struck me about this interview:- it was great to get Jobs' own view on the events that have since been serialized in his biography- the candid sadness and relative lack of bitterness over his ouster from Apple- how right he was about his 10 year predictions- the short section about MicrosoftThis is a great complement or introduction to the Steve Jobs story.
5,Makes you wish he was still here...,Just a treat to see into the mind of Steve Jobs. Just thought outside the box so much that his ideas were loved by the world. He knew what people wanted before they knew. He was a true visionary and too bad he's no longer with us.
1,Thius cd is ok.,Well... this cd is definatly dissapionting. itonly has 2 songs on it. i suggest not getting it go for the more evpensive ones that are probly a full cd not just 2 songs.
1,Worthless,"Inaccurate, says my salmon is 135 degrees after only 5 minutes in the oven. The fish was still raw and cold! Tried it on three occasions, inaccurate each time. Plus, you have to unscrew 4 tiny screws just to put in batteries! Give me a break. Thought the remote feature would be convenient, but very disappointed.Another problem: it doesn't remember the last temp you set, so each time you cook, you have to push buttons to adjust up or down from 180 degrees, one degree per push. This is a real pain when you cook mostly low-temp items like fish.Specs say it takes 4 batteries, but the remote unit needs another 2."
5,Anti-deer scent container,Easy to use. Does not visually distract much in the garden. Durable and cost effective. Good color. Easy to put together.
3,Laser pointer,"Nicely packaged. Clear red dot on most surfaces, but it got lost (invisible) when I pointed it at a projection screen. May have been the angle, but I bought it to use during presentations, so wasn't thrilled by it."
1,"Very Poor: range, brightness, and beam width compared to...","At the same time I purchased this item from Amazon, I also purchased a ""5mw 532nm Astronomy Powerful Green Laser Pointer"". That one projects a beam several times more powerful (brighter) than this one, and a slightly wider beam, so it is easy to see at a couple hundred yards. This one has such a weak beam it won't go past about 100 yards. This one was about $25, the other about $8 shipped. Nough said."
2,"Great idea, poorly executed.","Speaking as a Brand Planner for a big ad agency and a huge railroad buff since birth I was dissapointed at the lack of depth in the book.It has a lot of great photos, some you may have seen before if you are a train buff, some you may have not. Not a whole lot more than that.By the description of the book, I was looking for someone to illustrate what great brands railroads once were. How a railroads like the Southern Pacific, Rio Grande or The New Haven really supported what their slogans and brands were with how the railroad was run. What kind of experience shippers and passengers had with their trains and how it was communicated across comp[any media like timetables, frieght car and locomotive paint schemes and tag lines like ""Mainline Through the Rockies.""The 1940s through the 1970s were amazing times for railroads and their brands, someone should put that together in a book, but not Mr. Lovegrove.Another one collecting dust on my shelf."
2,Wish I could use it,"Loved the feel, look and smell of this product. Unfortunately something in it made me break out horribly. Had to give it to my husband."
4,A great way to help teach your child to clean up!,"My three year old daughter loves Caillou. Caillou started out as a kids tv series in france. It is now a pbs series here in the USA, and it focuses on the trials and tribulations of a young boy. The books are written in the same narrative form as the TV series. This one in particular has Caillou picking up his toys before being allowed to eat some chocolate pudding. My daughter enjoys this book and has started helping me pick up her toys. Good for a boy or a girl!"
4,great things come in little packages,"small, powerful, and efficient. this a a great pepper mill without having a towering wooden one . this fits nicely on shelves or in cabinets."
3,could be better,I've owned this phone for awhile now. It is an ok phone. I have a couple of complaints that didn't begin until I had it over a year. The battery life on the cordless phone is very short. The volume of recordings on the answering machine is too quiet even on the loudest setting. My message comes out loud but the caller's is too soft or sometimes distorted.
1,Disappointing,"I was really disappointed by this book. Basically, the book is an attempt to cash in on the Inc magazine article from a few years ago. Many books published these days have the same origins in an article. Go to Inc site and read the article for free instead of buying the book which is basically the article and a ton of filler fluff.Don't waste you money on this one. The Rob Adams book A Good hard Kick in the A** is a lot better."
2,Strange Book,"Ok, I bit and bought a copy after seeing all the hype. I was disappointed to discover that it's not the book you are led to believe it is.There's next to nothing in it about starting or running an online business. Now this is truly bizarre considering who the author is.If you are looking at starting an old fashioned off-line type business, then it might be helpful. Suppose you wish to start a vacuum cleaner agency from your kitchen table or an mlm distributorship. Then I could see this being of some help. It's basically all about dialing for donuts endlessly from home.There's also very little of Gianforte in the book. Reading it you can't escape the conclusion that he farmed it out to his co-author, who then did all the work. Unfortunately the co-author is a journalist and not a businessman, so he focussed on the wrong things, in my opinion.If you are looking at starting an online business, go with ""Go Big or Go Home"" by Wil Schroter. Now that's the book that deserves this one's hype."
1,ridiculous,"I am alotted 1,000 words for my review. If I had the time I would type 'ridiculous' 1,000 times. I'll settle for one - ridiculous book. Absolutely ridiculous. Woops. Couldn't settle for just one 'ridiculous' because it's just so ridiculous."
4,Verbena,"Entertaining,yet all real life for women left holding the fort.The family values and relationships are stretched in all directions and it's love that as usual saves the day."
2,Zzzzzzzz....,"This was one of the most boring, plodding books I've ever attempted to read. I say ""attempted"" because I only made it about 1/3 of the way through. I skipped to the last five pages of the book, and I don't think I missed anything important.Ms. Kinkaid is a gifted writer, mechanically, she just needs to figure out a more compelling way to present her story. We don't need to know every move the character makes during her waking hours."
2,Dorman mirror glass 51326,"This is my 2nd purchase of this item, the 1st has fallen of the frame and broke. They should make the glue strips stronger !"
2,"Kaiser Cookie Sheet (Scratched, no recipe book, made in England, not Germany)","The cookie sheet came in unwrapped with some other items I ordered stacked on top of it! The cookie sheet was scratched all over! The sticker on the cookie sheet says ""made in England"", not Germany. No cook book!"
2,Not as advertised....,I just got these today and they are not as described here. The height is not 1.8 inches....it is more like .6 inches. There are not ribbed handles. These are flat cookie sheets with no sides. One side has a slight lip (that is the .6 inches part) which is what you use to put them in and out of the oven. There is no recipe book. These don't look bad but they are definitely not as described! I am going to try baking on one and see if they heat evenly - I will update this if they cook well.
3,Arrived scratched,They are a good price but arrived unwrapped and stacked on each other so they were scratched. Also sticker on top said made in England but the website says made in Germany. I asked Amazon about this and I was told to check with the manufacturer. Does Amazon care about what their website advertises? I guess not. Also said it would come with recipe book but no book and I bought four sheets.
5,One of the Best!!,"This is one of my all time favourite CDs in my collection. David Soul has a great voice and you can hear his love of music in his songs. The songs are all classic ""David Soul"". If you are remembering David from years past this is a MUST have in your collection. Brava!"
2,"syrupy, but . . .","David Soul is a guy from South Dakota. Hois family later moved to Western PA. His sister, Mary Solberg, is an old friend of mine, and I've lost track of her. If cyberspace can help me find her, I'd appreciate it."
3,"Anyone remember ""Playing To An Audience Of One""?","I wish they would also reissue some of the earlier LPs. Does anyone remember the old LP ""Playing To An Audience Of One"" - I loved that album as a child.."
2,Not as durable as wanted,The brush started loosing brissles and the scrubber did not hold up well at all. The quality is not what I was hopeing for.
4,heavy duty,This brush has done the trick for me. It is sturdy and has ample steel wool on it. The handle could be stronger but for the price I am very happy with it.
4,Great Tool,"This is a great tool for all grill owners. With the long handle, so you don't have to get you hand over the coals (for those who have a Charcoal Grill) and the three great tools for cleaning off the grates, you couldn't ask for anything more. Oh, and the price isn't so bad either."
2,Plastic handle melting alert,Did a fine job cleaning... but the plastic couldn't endure the heat during cleaning... going to get a new one with stainless steel or wood handle
3,Not great,I was disappointed in the performance of this brush. It was OK but not as good as I'd hoped. I was looking for a more heavy duty brush to handle heavy duty and I didn't feel this did that kind of job.
4,"About what you would expect, handle not comfortable","I received this as a gift, and have not used it yet, but, it looks good. The only complaint I have is the handle is not comfortable. But, it's about what you would expect for a cheap grill brush."
1,don't buy this kettle,"This one ( Chef's Choice M677SSG ) has very bad connection with the base, some time it's works, some time not,This kettle also has silicone (polymers) and plastic parts inside which is bed,plastic ""filter"" popped out ones and was found melted in the bottom of the kettle.Paint from handle started pilling as well...Will look for kettles made in Germany , not in China ..."
2,"Be careful, it soon leaks","This is an attractive kettle that does its job well, except that after a year or so mine leaked water from somewhere around the switch, twice. It was replaced under warranty once, but the replacement did the same thing after less than a year. Reluctantly, I replaced it with an AromaAWK-115S. I've yet to find out if this replacement eventually leaks, but it's attractive and so far does OK.John Myers in Milwaukee"
4,Electric kettle,This is pretty good kettle. Would have like a little bigger size for the price.Would recommend it above most others.
4,FZ,I like it very much. Kettle is in a good working condition and it looks good in a kitchen with all stainless steel appliances. I would recomend to purchase this kettle as a good quality item.
1,Do not buy!!,"I also had this product for 3 months before it stopped working entirely. The manufacturer refused to refund the purchase, but Amazon was kind enough to step in. It has plastic components on the inside, and didn't turn itself off until well after it should, which was frustrating, but I lived with it until it ceased to function. I will never order a Chef's Choice item again after my experience with their customer service. Amazon = Win, Chef's Choice = Fail."
4,Convenience,If you would like a quick cup of tea or free up a burner on your stove this is it! It gets the water really hot unlike some other electric kettles. Compact. The exterior spots easily but cleans up easily too.
2,Just OK kettle,"Boils water well BUT I bought it to get away from plastic but this kettle has plastic parts inside - hence heated plastic is unavoidable. Also, the lid emits steam from the back as well as the spout and the plastic handle is blistering from that steam after only a few months use. Finally, the kettle stopped working altogether after only a year's use."
5,Gift that keeps on giving,I gave this one as a gift! I received one myself and love it..my sister absoultely love hers and uses it daily..great service for a great product! Thanks
3,OK kettle,"Have it for 2 months now. The thing I don't like aboit it that it takes too long to switch off when water already boiling. Even it is made mostly of steel, too many plastics are come in contact with te boiling water."
3,Good looking pot but not well made,"The unit does what it's supposed to do - boil water - and with it's high wattage rating, it does it quickly. However, after almost a year of using it, the bottom of the handle has become loose. It can still boil water but I have a feeling that it will just break apart one of these days. It is also difficult to clean the inside. The opening is too narrow to scrub the inside. My unit regularly gets scales since I use tap water and not filtered water. As one other reviewer has noted, the inside of the pot is not entirely stainless steel. There is quite a lot of plastic inside."
4,"Great looking, solid, and works well","I initially purchased a plastic kettle, as that is what I'm used to in Hotel rooms when I travel, especially in Asia. The first one came cracked and I returned it to Amazon and they sent me another one. That one didn't sit right on the base, and ended up not making electrical contact unless I held it down! So I returned that one and didn't want another plastic one, and ordered this stainless steel one from Chef's Choice. It works as it is supposed to, looks great, and is very solid.The one thing is that it doesn't shut off right away after boiling. This delay causes a lot of hot steam to rise from the spout until it shuts off, so you won't want to place this under a cabinet during use as the steam could affect the bottom of your wood cabinets."
1,Great - for a few months,"I really liked ours, however, the heating element contacts do not seem to be heat resistant. This can be a problem when you want to use the kettle for heating water.Even after a few months the heater contacts stopped working unless the pot was ""clocked"" just right relative to the base. Over time the range of locations that were ""right"" became narrower. Now, they just don't work. (And yes we did use and care for it according to the manual.)I would say that it could be used for a cold water pitcher but the lid does not really open wide enough to fill with ice easily. In fact getting liquid water in can be a bit tricky."
1,good wallpaper steamer,I loved the look of ths electric kettle but it took so long for the automatic shut off to kick in that my ceiling paint would have been peeling before very long. I returned this kettle.
1,Paint has blistered on top of handle by the lid,"This is my decond kettle, the first lasted for several years, so I bought the same model. The paint or covering or whatever is on the handle, at the top near the lid, is blistering. Very disappointed."
3,Corrosion problem,"After four years of daily use, the inside bottom started to rust. We noticed this when the heated water started to turn color."
2,Level with added features,"I bought this level out of curiosity since it was once on sale for $3.15.It's a 24"" level with a slot and sliding holes in the middle. It's supposed to help in marking points as it has sliding plastic clips with holes in the middle, but is absolutely not necessary. In fact, the distances from the edges to the holes (the number you need to add to mark a hole at some specific distance from the end) is either 4-17/32"" or 3-15/16"", which means you spend more time figuring out the math than you save marking the holes. Worse, the pencil holes are huge making it difficult to mark the centers accurately.I have hung hundreds of shelves, paintings, and cabinets with an ordinary level just fine. Like I said, I bought this level since it was so cheap, and get the most use out of it using it an ordinary one."
3,"Writing too ""flowery""","The story is good, but the writing is so overly descriptive and ""flowery"" that I would get tired of it, and try to skip ahead to when something was actually happening. This book could have easily been half as long without leaving out anything of importance at all."
4,Bump Cap protects head unobtrusively,"The bump cap insert blends in under the baseball cap I had to cut a bit around the rim to fit my cap. Once I got it fitted, it made the cap look better and more importantly protects head from bumping it against a ladder or cabinet etc. Good buy, I'm thinking of getting a couple more for my other caps."
2,Can't use it.,"It barely makes it into a baseball cap, and it's not elongated enough for comfort. Makes the hat sit too high on the head to be comfortable or for correct appearance. That said, the plastic quality seems fine."
3,Great idea wrong size,"The Good: product works and is not noticeable when placed in a ball cap.The Bad: One size only and tends to make your head sweat.Over all it's a good idea, the size is a bit large for my head so I gifted it to a friend that works in a warehouse. It seems to fit him fine and he's not said anything negative about it's use."
2,bump cap,cap is way to big to fit any normal size ball cap unless you have a frankenstien size head. i used my cutter and trimmed around the edges taking off and inch around then it was able to fit in my cap. your better off getting the the cap with the insert already in there.
5,good product,good product justabout what I expected was a little big for my hats but a little trimming along the edges and was able to make it fit perfect love the way my hats don't sag in the back anymore just a clean crisp look love it
3,Good exposure to a lot of basic principles,"This can give you a basic idea of what management is going to be like, and the tasks that will be necessary, but in all reality, a book isn't going to tell you how to do your job. If you have to buy this for coursework, I still don't know if I would consider buying it unless it's mandatory. Even then, you could just check it out from the library if they've got one or two on reserve. There isn't a whole lot in this book that isn't common sense, and there isn't a whole lot that will really get you anywhere if you're already a professional. I spent my money on it because I always bought all my books for my classes, but this is one of those books that I rarely opened before and I will probably never open it again."
4,Used in a Renewable Energy course of study,"In today's environment, students must anticipate and prepare for employing themselves. The Construction Project Management book provides an overall understanding of many of the details to organize and manage a construction project. Together with knowledge of renewable energy systems, and a course in Entrepreneurial Business Management, the student can realistically start their own business and employ both themselves, and others."
5,Excellent resource for the identification of bulbs.,"I have four of Taylors Guides (Bulbs, Annuals, Perennials, Roses). All these books are an indispensable resource for identifying every species of flowers imaginable. The care and growing information is brief and often doesn't address every question you may have, but it's certainly enough to get you started. There's an excellent section on pests, mulching and fertilizing as well as a glossary of nurseries. I LOVE THESE BOOKS."
1,Very Poor Quality,"The third time that I used this juicer (for exactly what it was supposedly designed - squeezing juice from lime halves), it broke into pieces. It is made of inferior quality ""pot"" metal (zinc chromate?) and should be withdrawn from the market. Don't waste your time and money on this piece of junk."
2,Citrus Juicer Broken Hinge,"The KitchenAid Citrus Juicer was easy to use and did work well, however, after about 6 months, the hinge broke. Either our Citrus Juicer had a flaw, or KitchenAid needs to add more reinforcement near the hinge where there is high stress. We are returning our Citrus Juicer to KitchenAid for a replacement, it did work well while it lasted."
5,Sir Gawain and the Green Knight,"The standard text for serious aficionados of ""Sir Gawain and the Green Knight,"" edited byJRR Tolkien--cf Lord of the Rings. It still has the same green cover and illustration that it had35 years ago in my Pearl Poet class! It presents the Middle English text without the accompaniment of a modern English translation. However, 61 pages of detailed notes and 68 pages of extensive glossery make this bookwell worth having for those who want the experience of reading the original text. A lot is lost in translation,even within the same language. Going from Middle English to Modern English is a lot like drinking warm cokethat's been left out overnight in a glass--the real essence is gone. So I'd recommend the struggle the textdemands. It's really worth it and Tolkien's notes and glossery are a great help. You can get Tolkien's translation to Modern English in another book, without the Middle English, if you want to have that extra assistance."
4,Sir Gawain and the Green Knight,"No problem with this product, except that I didn't expected to see the ANGLO-SAXON original version of the text."
4,3m weatherstrip adhesive works fast,"In the process of restoring an old convertible, this product came highly recommended. When the surface is well cleaned and prepped, this adhesive does the job. Once applied to matereal such as weather strip or convertible cloth, you have an approximate working time of 5 minutes before it begins to fully set. The consistency is simular to 90w gear lube so have plenty of drop cloths handy and use it sparingly. It can also be use in other applications where a quick set adhesive is needed and comes in either black or yellow. A bit on the pricy side but (I believe) well worth it."
5,3M weatherstrip adhesive,"This is the best weatherstrip adhesive money can buy, easy to use and is totally fit for purpose.It can be used on any vehicle that has rubber weatherstriping,it is just simply brilliant."
4,Good value,"Got these for my Airedale, per the vet's recommendation that he should take a dose of glucosamine/chondroitin, each day. These are a good value."
3,over rated,This is not what I expected on both the weight lost and the blood sugar. I would not buy this again not the value I was expecting.
4,Great product....,"My knees get better and worse. Tough to tell if it's this product or the weather or what exactly. It isn't hurting them, which are for sure. Noticed a difference (more pain) when I traveled without the pills, but it could be weather, too."
5,I SEEMS TO WORK REALLY WELL,"its usually hard to tell whether supplements work or not, all I know is my knee arthritis was really acting up and ibuprofen wasn't relieving the pain. Two days after taking 2/day of Dr's Best Glucosamine/Chondroitin/MSM, my knee started feeling allot better. Could be coincidence maybe, but I'll keep taking these when my joints get sore again."
2,4 Tablets a Day,"These are only 750 mg Glucosamine/600 mg Chondroitin per 2 Tablets, so two tablets twice a day. The Kirkland Glucosamine HCI 1500mg Chondroitin Sulfate 1200mg per 2 tablets is much less expensive."
5,Keeps me walking,This is essential to me and my wife. We make good use of this in order to keep hips and knees operational on a daily basis. Without this combination of Glucosamine and Chondroitin life rapidly becomes grim.
4,Excelente para las articulaciones en personas de mas de 60. Mi madre las usa.,"Mi madre y mi tía usan esta medicina. Ellas son mayores de 60 y les ayuda mucho con sus articulaciones, sobre todo de rodillas."
4,Happy,Good product.worked for me almost instantly. Could feel the diff very quick. Joints felt a bit rusty and this did well by them!
4,Dosage is FOUR capsules with this brand,"I just started taking this so I'll have to see if it works for me. Judging by the reviews, it is an effective brand.However, you need FOUR CAPSULES of this brand to get the recommended 1500 mg of glucosamine. So be aware that if you buy this one, you'll be taking more per day, although the capsules are small and easy to swallow."
3,"Good Value, not great to swallow","Pros+ value+ Glu/Cho/MSM combo works, after 4-5 weeks the pain of the knee and hip cartilage almost gone+ I take half the recommended amount and it seems to be sufficientCons- the pills are HUGE and get stuck in my throat quite often- when it happens, sometimes the coating of the stuck pill dissolves in the throat and the powder leaves a very weird taste and discomfort in the mouth+ what is a pro of that con, occasionally when the pill gets stuck, the coating dissolves and you burp, the powder (a.k.a. the star dust) comes out of your mouth! :)"
4,Price MUST be a typo!!,"This toy was a hand-me-down from my sister. My daughter has played with it since she was 6M old. She was carrying it around the house at her 1 yr birthday party and dropped it. The toy broke into pieces! She obviously loved the toy, but it had to be thrown away because the jagged plastic couldn't be repaired or glued back together. I can't seem to find it anywhere, but here, on Amazon for an exorbitant price. What gives? Is this a typo? I swore it was [...] when I researched it before the toy was broken! The one we had was about 15"" long and maybe 4"" high? Is the one pictured here a much bigger toy? I hope someone can suggest an alternative if the price is really [...]!! If it is, then it's not worth it! Can you imagine your [...] smashed into pieces in one drop??"
4,Musical Car Review,This product was a very big hit at a birthday party. The one year old loved the toy and couldn't quit pushing the buttons. The two year old also really enjoyed the toy and couldn't stop playing with it.
1,Electronics failure,"Concept was good, but fails because its not constructed well. After 2 months the toy's electronics went out."
5,"Espectacular Wallet, all the luxury and quaity expected",I loved the wallet.The material is very nice and the looks are great. The pockets and the compartments are well distributed around the wallet.Bulgari is the brand to own and wear.Don't miss the opportunity to have an article from them.
1,Misleading Product Information,"This laser pointer emits a RED beam, not blue as the title indicates. It is referring to the barrel color. The product description is non-specific about the beam color which is odd as well. I specifically was wanting to purchase a blue laser pointer and got a red one instead. Now I get to go thru the hassle of trying to return it and pay for shipping both ways or cut my losses and keep a purchase that I do not want."
3,Heavier than expected,"definitely a durable laser pointer. heavier than expected once batteries were put in it. there was no ""clip"" on it to keep it in your pocket as the description states. cheap plastic cap for end once batteries are installed. laser worked, but i'll buy another lighter one for traveling."
1,"Review of Billy Ray Vaughn's ""The Sky is Falling.""","I had not had the opportunity/fortune to ever hear Vaughn's works before selecting him as a class assignment(JMC 490) and so I delved into his bio first and then listened only to the entire 10 tracks of this cd only and my remarks concern exclusively these arrangements. After playing the album several times, I came to the conclusion that if I had CD-RW capabilities, I would only copy #10, ""Life By The Drop."" On this track Vaughn used an acoustical guitar without electrical amplification. The piece was masterfully played, beautiful to listen to and thoroughly enjoyable. There was a traditional sound and feeling both musically with the lyrics conveying truly a blues message. I really liked this piece over and above any of the other tracks and if this is what Stevie Ray Vaughn is all about, I could be a fan."
2,2 and 1/2 stars : an average record with some good songs,"i don't understand the five stars ratings for this record, for me it is really average; the bad news first : i don't like his voice and it rather detracts the music than the contrary, plus personally, and that is purely subjective, i think he plays with too heavy strings; 'Little Wing' is a bad endless version, way too repetitive (the fact he didn't understand that playing the same musical theme over and over again was to turn this great song of Hendrix into such a repetitive thing is beyond me); the good news: the sky is crying, May I have a talk with you (raw and bluesy, my favorite track), Life by the Drop (a simple but nice bluesy ballad), the instrumental Chitlins con carne, are good though i find his guitar playing on the excellent 'May i have...' a little bit repetitive, he seems to play the same melodic theme, with some bits of variations over and over again; however the four songs that i quoted are worth a listening."
5,"Excellent performance, deeply moving.","After buying this CD, I immediately realized that this CD is pure gold.This album is intended as a tribute, compiled after SRV's death by his brother Jimmie in 1991. Indeed, Jimmie Vaughan invariably had a hard time putting this one together. Taking the best of those recordings which hadn't been used already in previous albums, you get an excellent set that couldn't be better.As many of these songs were recorded numerous times, some are rare versions. My favorite is ""Little Wing"" from the '84 Power Station session. You can actually hear the amp buzzing in the background. It just brings him that much closer. What a tender and heartfelt performance went into the making of his music.He will always be deeply cherished and missed."
5,Guitar heaven,"As Eric Clapton has said, Stevie had a direct line running from his heart to the guitar neck, bypassing his brain altogether. It means he didn't have to think ahead about what he was going to play, it just flowed straight through. This album is a great example of that statement. He OWNS the guitar and utilizes every avenue of his technique and mastery to produce sounds that no other guitarist will ever produce. That sound comes from his daily practicing, his strength and his dedication to his influences. While these are definitely outtakes, I believe they more clearly represent SRV's Texas R&B roots than any other cd. And, while risking redundancy from other previous reviews, ""Little Wing"" is pure guitar heaven. Those of us who knew him and loved him and his artistry know without a doubt that that's where he's playing now."
4,Vaughan's best album,"I've become a huge SRV fan in the last year or so. His guitar playing reaches right into your soul and takes it down a lonesome winding path. No song represents this better on the album than ""Life by the Drop"", a fantastic reflection on a rough road traveled through life. My favorite SRV album."
4,One of the bests from SRV!!,"SRV was a great disciple of Lonnie Mack and what we can understand is that he learned that lessons like no other! Magical guitar riffs in an astonishing velocity,and with great Albert King's influences.A great album!!"
5,What could have been,"THE SKY IS CRYING is an album of outtakes and alternate versions of songs the SRV had never been able to put to record. Here this songs were released after his tragic death and if these songs are just outtakes, we are left thinking what could have been. The songs rock and show how talented a musician SRV really was. BOOT HILL is a rockin number that kicks off the album and it is a dirty blues rocker that takes no prisoners. THE SKY IS CRYING is next and we can hear SRV playing some mean slide on this slow tempo blues track that stands out. LIFE BY THE DROP is an acoustic gem that shows off another side of SRV guitar playing and is the 2nd best song off the album. EMPTY ARMS, MAY I HAVE A TALK WITH YOU, LITTLE WING AND WHAM are songs that must be listened to and I think that all who read this review will enjoy them and this album."
4,Very effective... very noisy,This is the most effective Squeegee we've found for our shower doors. Unfortunately it is also squeaky when being used. We still think it's worth the noise to be able to squeegee the doors ultra fast. Now I know why the professional window washers use this type!
4,great deal,"I purchased this carrier bag for my move to Texas and it did a wonderful job. My rack was a bit small for the bag, but it held on nicely for 1300 miles when completely full. Without the specialized bags, it didn't hold its shape very well, but the straps supplied did a fine job of holding on.The straps get a bit noisy if not tied off or pinned down, and every once in a while something would bump the roof and make a funny noise, but no damage to the car or things inside. And the waterproofing did a good job. Nothing was wet inside even though it sprinkled a bit during the drive."
4,It does the job,"It worked for us. We purchased this bag to help us carry our luggage to the cruise port about 4 hours from our home. We encountered no rain, so I cannot comment on waterproof; however I can say it worked. It held 3 very large suit cases. We used bungee cords for extra support. While traveling down the road about 70 miles per hour we heard some noise like it was raining. It was the flaps making that noise. Double checked once or twice to make sure it was secure and it was. I would recommend it."
3,My experience differs,"I see other people had some problems with excessive flapping, but the carrier kept their belongings dry. Well, on a trip from Oklahoma to northern California, we had no problems with flapping, even though we hadn't used any tie-downs other than the straps provided. Unfortunately, everything in the carrier was dampened somehow. The carrier had been through rain, snow, and hail on the trip, so it's not exactly surprising that this had occurred; it's just not what I had come to expect based on the other customer reviews. I didn't see anywhere that the bag had been perforated, so maybe it just isn't as waterproof as advertised."
5,Great product at a great price!,Easy to install. Straps stayed tight the whole trip. Everything was dry- even after 24+ hours of rain- some quite heavy. It folds nice and small since we don't have lots of room for storage when we aren't using it.My only complaint is that the zipper is only on 2 sides. It would have been nicer to have it on 3 sides since we have a tall vehicle and are shorter people.
5,Worked Great,Just got back from a trip from Ohio to Florida. It rained most of the way down and part of the way back. I went ahead and put our luggage in garbage bags just in case but we did not get any water inside. The bag strapped on quite easily and I would recommend taping the straps down to eliminate wind noise. All in all a great product and I had not problems using it.
5,"I was nervous about this, but it worked great!","We drove from Northern VA to the OBX and used the Carpak for extra space. It was able to fit three large duffel bags filled with stuff, plus random bags of towels, toiletries, etc. It really did fit a lot! I was nervous about it being waterproof after reading some of the reviews, but we drove for about 2 hours in heavy rain . . . everything was completely dry when we unpacked! We also purchased some cambuckle straps (link below) for extra support on the top - paranoid it would fly off halfway through the trip! The four extra straps were easy to put on and the Carpak never moved. I am very pleased with this item. We made it home with no problems!CargoLoc Cambuckle 52306 4-Piece Locking Tie Down Pack"
4,Good value.,"The bag was easy to set up and strap to the top of my van. Holds a ton. I used rachet straps (cheaply bought at Harbor Freight) to ensure that the included straps on the bad didn't have to hold all the load. The provided straps look a little flimsy, but I would never use the bag straps by themselves anyway. I love this bag because of the value and the fact that I got exactly what a I needed (which was a bad to use once a year during vacation)."
5,Great roof top bag.,"We took this bag out for its first try for a Labor Day weekend camping trip to Alabama, a 9+ hour drive. We fit 4 folding chairs, an air mattress, a 15x12 tent, a 12x8 tent, a 12x12 dining canopy and several other items in the bag with no problem!"
5,Great Product,"Great product! I was skeptical because of reasonable price. However, I gave it a try due to the many good reviews on Amazon. It performed great. It secured well & stayed secure to my roof rack (I did use additional tie downs...just to make sure). Over about 1300 miles of driving, with about 1/4 to 1/3 of the drive in moderate rain, the interior of the bag stayed perfectly dry. (When I first opened the new bag, it had a light aroma just like a swimming pool liner...must be a similar waterproof material). And best of all, when not in use, it will fold up into a small space (unlike a hard shell rooftop carrier). Buy this unit with confidence."
1,Try something else,This broke the first few hours of a road trip. Almost as effective as putting things in garbage bags and strapping to the top of your car.
3,Overall good buy,"The bag itself worked as advertised, but the tie downs are inadequate. Be prepared to purchase extra tie downs or bungees if you plan to drive freeway speeds. Also, because of it's square shape when fully loaded, your fuel economy will be compromised."
4,"Trip to Idaho, and back to Colorado","We received this item a couple of days before we were scheduled to leave for Idaho. As was stated in another review, this does not fit all vehicles with roof racks. We used this on a 2008 Kia Sorento, and the racks are not completely adjustable and had to be moved as far to the rear as possible, and the carrier had to be turned sideways. Instead of the tie downs being in the front and the rear, we had to tie the carrier down on the sides of the roof rack. Other than that little set-back, it provided enough room for 4 large suitcases, dog food, blankets, room for a box of dishes that we brought back from Idaho, after the dog food and blankets were dropped off, AND a Big Wheel for a 2 y/o., that was in the box. All in all, this performed admirably. We didn't encounter any inclement weather, but we had wind all the way from Cheyenne Wy., to the Utah border. This did effect our gas mileage, but once the wind stopped, we were able to get 20 mpg, again."
1,great for 4 hours,"We just got back from our second trip using this bag. DON'T CHEAPEN OUT, GET A HARD TOP CARRIER. The first leg of our first trip down our suitcases almost ended up scattered over the Garden State Parkway!! People were frantically pointing to our roof and low and behold the pack had opened (lesson to us to use twist ties or a small padlock next time to secure the zipper). On our trip home we had to stop constantly because the ties kept loosening up. When my husband took the pack off the car we found there was a hole in the pack the size of a fist. Wouldn't you think that we wouldn't use it again??? Well we are a glutton for punishment and my husband has great faith in duct tape. On this recent trip one of the straps ripped clear off and we had to tie it down with what was on hand. Its unusable now after roughly 25 hours of use."
1,Poor design,"On our 2nd trip (the 1st being only 2 hours) the straps began to tear away from the bag. Poor design, the straps are just sewn to the bag - causing an obvious failure point. The bag itself is great, very waterproof, and can hold a lot. The strap failure was disappointing, it also happened in the middle of back roads Colorado. So I had to find a store that had some rope or something so the bag wouldn't just fly off my Explorer. I mean the bag is supposed to be strapped to the roof and then the vehicle driven, right?"
2,not too happy,"Although the carrier was easy to install and held more than I expected, it is NOT weatherproof as it claims to be. On my trip from Michigan to North Dakota, my family and I encountered pretty heavy rains and storms. The carrier filled up with water soaking our luggage, sleeping bags and pillows. Just check the weather before you travel with this carrier."
4,Great bang for the buck.,This product is quite good for the price. We took it on a 1700 mile round trip through a little bit of rain and had no problems at all with the unit. I didn't give it five stars because I think the straps used to hold it down could be designed a bit better to deal with the excess strap. We ended up using a bit of duct tape to tape up the excess in the straps so they wouldn't blow all over the place. Other than that the product works as advertised. Would recommend.
4,Good buy so far!,"We had a 13 hour drive and hit some moderate rain on our way up. Nothing inside got wet, so that was good. Like other reviewers have said it would be nice if the bag zipped/un-zipped on three sides instead of two, but for the price you really can't complain. The bag did hold a ton of stuff which was great. I would recommend this product."
5,Very solid product,Just went on vacation round trip 1500 miles and the carrier held up like a champ. This carrier held more than I thought and made the trip more enjoyably comfortable. Survived rain and strong winds without a hitch. Strongly recommend this carrier if you do not need a lockable carrrier.
2,Hardware not included,"We received this product but did not receive the hardware to attach it to the crossbars on our SUV. Product does not look like the picture, there were no straps. Very dissapointed."
5,Great!,I was able to fit all my luggage in it for college. I would recommend buying additional straps just for extra security atop your car.
2,Straps tore on first use.,"I used this carrier on a roundtrip drive from so. cal. to Grand Canyon. After 2 days, two of the straps began to tear at the stitching on the carrier. I believe it is still water proof because the inside layer is still in tack. But I was hoping for something more durable. Maybe I cinched it up too tight, but I will probably return it and try again."
1,Terrible- really 0 stars,"The first time I went to install my Karpak two of the straps ripped right off. Now I am having trouble getting anyone to answer my customer service inquiry. It says right in the warrenty that this would be covered, but no one answers my e-mails. Therefore, at this point I would not recommend purchasing this item."
5,worked great for trip from NC <-> FL,"What can I say, it worked very well for our 11-hour trip. We drove through rain with no problems, and we were able to fit quite a bit of stuff inside it. We had it completely full on the trip home: the front of the carrier hung over the front carrier rack rail on our rav4 and made some flapping noise for most of the trip, but that wasn't that big of a deal once we realized it wasn't going to pop off. I did secure it with a few extra ratchet straps though. In retrospect we should have probably gotten the smaller model.Worked great, cheap price, I'd recommend it."
5,great product,"I researched this carrier before I bought it from Amazon.When it arrived at my house, I noticed that the whole thing is like a rubber material. And it does not leak at all."
1,Dissatisfied customer,"We were only able to use this product, Highland 10391 Kar Pack twice. The second time used, one strap broke and the other was almost tore from the material. If another car driver hadn't flagged me down while driving, we would have lost everything in the bag. As it was, I had to go back and find the queensize mattress that had fallen out of the bag. Somehow when the strap broke, the items shifted enough that the zipper opened and then items were starting to fall out. I am very disappointed that we paid $55 to use this item twice. Will not purchase again."
4,car pack,"I have had only one opportunity to use it, but it was wonderful. I could pack a lot of stuff in that little bag."
4,2 sided zipper makes loading somewhat difficult,"Size is great and attaching is fairly straight foward. Liked the fact that it is waterproof but have not yet used it in the rain to evaluate its water resistance.Only issue I have with it is that the zipper is only on 2 sides and not three which is more typical allowing for flipping the top over for loading. This would allow for loading and unloading on both sides where with only 2 sides zippered it only allows for loading on the passenger and rear side of the bag while on the car. Since the rear is relively difficult to get to, loading and unloading only can be done easily from one side. This has not been a major issue, but it would be easier to load and unload from both sides of the car."
2,Bad straps,"We were using the Highland 10391, for a trip to florida from NJ. Halfway through the trip one strap ripped off from the carrier, then a wahile later another. it was a good thing we had brought straping in case this happended. Also we we got to Florida, the suit case in side was wet from rain. I would not buy."
4,highland car top carrier worked out great,"I would have given this carrier a rating of a 5, however, I think something needs to be done with the zipper. It was a little tough getting in the front of it putting in your items, but we did pack it full. The zipper only goes along one side and the front. Maybe there is a reason for that I don't know. But this carrier made it from Indiana through Colorado, Utah and into Las Vegas with NO damage. Nothing was wet. Went through some snow/sleet in the mountains, lots of wind. It will look brand new when I wash it. But when using this, do use some safety pins to tie down the straps. Great for the $$$$$"
4,Rather pleased,"I have used my Kar Pak only twice so far but have been quite pleased with it. I knew I didn't want a hard shell carrier because I don't really have the space to store such a thing, so soft shell was going to be the only choice. I like how they have the straps arranged. Even if you are not completely filling it you can still keep everything snug. I only had to drive a few hours with it but I can tell you that it did not budge, and I don't think it would have had I driven cross country."
3,Not made very well,"We used this carrier for a family trip to the Outer Banks a few weeks ago. It was great...except for the fact it is now falling apart. The seams where you tighten the straps are coming apart. We might get one or two more uses out of it before the seam completely splits. But, the construction does not seem to be all that great. Other than the seams ripping, we really like it. We barely noticed it was there. Was easy to put up and take down."
5,It worked great!,"We purchased this item to move our daughter from Pennsylvania to Los Angeles. So, it was on the car for 3,100 miles and it worked great. We did take the advice of another reviewer and used additional straps to secure the carrier to her SUV. (We used straps with come-along fasterners but bungee cords were also suggested). We were also careful to tuck in the extra straps so nothing flapped around on top. Fully packed, on top of her Toyota Highlander, the total car height was 7'2"", which was just small enough to get us into parking garages at night. Everything inside was in perfect condition upon our arrival. We would definitely recommend this carrier."
5,GREAT CAR TOP CARRIER,This car top carrier was the greatest purchase this year. We took it on a 6 hour trip to Wisconsin through heavy down pour for about 1 hour strait with no leaking. Everything was totally dry. It held 4 very large suitcases and was stuffed to maximum. My average speed was 75 mile per hour and held up like a champ. I would highly recomend this product to anyone.
5,Great Buy!,"This project was inexpensive and held up very nicely, we are definitly statisfied customers. Took the bag on a 10hr trip to the beach, drove thru serveral rain storms, and nothing was wet. Bag holds a lot of items, really we have no compliants!"
2,Fell apart on first trip,"This product was disappointing. Before I got home from our first trip using it, one of the straps had ripped off the bag (while driving)and I had to stop and purchase some long bungee cords to hold it on till we got home. Also, pieces of the outer rubber coating had come off in random places, allowing rain to get into the bag. All I can do with it now is trash it."
3,"Cross-bars needed, but they don't tell you that.","I haven't installed and used this carrier yet, so I can't speak to its quality, but shoppers should be aware that when it says ""attaches to any factory roof rack,"" that's not the whole story. Nowhere does it state that crossbars are a necessity to install this carrier, so I assumed my factory side rails would be adequate.Had I known this when ordering, Amazon could've sold me the crossbars at the same time. Sadly for them, they lost a sale because the bars won't arrive in time for my cross-country move, and I will need to shop locally--something I really don't have time for.Amazon, do your customers a favor and tell them upfront what is required to install and use this product!"
4,Good Product,This is definitely a good product if you don't have room for a lot of luggage on the inside of your vehicle. Easy to use and provides lots of extra storage space while traveling. Recommend using extra bungy cords or tie downs for extra security.
1,waste of money,The first strap broke 30min into our trip. It flew off and went under the car behind us-lucky no crash! We had to stop and buy bungee cords to hold it on the rest of the way. We when arrived the bag had multiple tiny tears. Our stuff got wet when it rained. Before we came home we had to tape the whole bag with waterproof tape. Half way home (about 6 hours into trip) people on the highway started honking at us as another strap had broken and the bag was sliding off the bag of our van- suitcases and all. We had to buy a 20$ strap to hold it on. I called customer service to report problem and was told rep was at lunch and would call me back- haven't heard back from them at all.
3,Effective product but not as described,"The Highland Soft Sided Car Top Carrier was a truly waterproof carrier and rode well and was very stable when placed between the existing standard roof rack on our Rav 4 Toyota. We traveled from New York State to Florida and at turnpike speeds without shift or displacement of any kind on the carrier.We used masking tape on the loose straps to eliminate the slapping at highway speeds.The carrier did not,however, open on three sides as described.The Zipper opened up two sides which made it necessary to fold the cover back and stuff heavy items (in our case) into the pocket that was not open...pita style. Horsing heavy items around on the top of the car from the ground while also stuffing the pocket-like covered half of the carrier made using it a whole lot more difficult than if it had been manufactured as described."
2,Great while it lasts,"I purchased this bag in 2009 for the family trips to the shore. It has made about 2-3 trips each year since then (used about 8 times). Over the last few trips one of the straps has pulled away from the bag and is hanging on my the strings (literally). This trip the second strap has started ripping off. I have been through driving rain with it and everything stayed dry (I made sure the zipper was not across the front). It holds a lot of stuff and never moved during the trip. I only wish that the straps would have been secured better. The last trip I bungeed the bag down so we could get home. If that was changed this could have been 5 stars, but now I'm off to find a different bag to replace this one, so it's a 2 star. The price was cheap but the life of the bag was short too."
2,Didn't hold up.,"We have taken this bag on two large trips. Both trips were in excess of 4 hours each way and it rained at least one way on each trip. In both cases, the bag held a significant amount of cargo and kept it dry. The problem is that on the second trip, 2 of the 4 straps tore off the bag. We are lucky that the bag stayed on top of the car, because it could have caused significant damage if it flew off. The other problem is that we cannot use the bag for the return trip, yet we still need a roof-top carrier, so we are going to have to get a different bag quickly."
4,Tough cookie,"Very sturdy. The Bar Carrier I purchased to fasten this to let go in the middle of a trip and the bag landed in the middle of the highway. While there were several holes in the bag after skidding on the blacktop at 70 mph, none of my belongings in the bag were harmed."
3,Does the job.,"Has plenty of space but the seams where the straps attach to the case started to pull away, but that was due to it being summer time and we drove through a desert, it also didn't happen until we were returning from our trip. Like my title says, it does the job."
1,Not durable. Do not buy.,"We bought this car top carrier to help transport items during our move from Maryland to Rhode Island. After completing our first and only drive using the car top carrier, we noticed the attachment points (where the fabric straps attach to the rainproof material) had starting tearing. I cannot recommend this item."
4,Holds up well over time,"This is a durable cookie sheet. I have owned it since May 2000, and it looks almost as good as the day I purchased it. More amazingly, it has not bent or dented over time either. It doesn't get treated especially well because I always wash it in the dishwasher; the finish has held up. This size is particularly suited to a smaller oven, and I like having the raised edge on one side, which serves as a grip."
1,This product is a flat-out scam,"Product is a scam. It's a magnet, the same type you place on your gas tank to increase gas mileage. Look up how to properly serve wine; those simply opening and pouring are definitely seeing a difference by opening, waiting 30 minutes (with a silly magnet on top), and pouring.Product is similar to some ""cell phone battery life extenders"" that amount to a sticker and instructions on how to quickly break in a fresh cell phone battery (a few full charge/discharge cycles). Product claims that the product itself imparts a specific effect, when in reality it's the specific actions taken that produce the effect, with the product being a prop meant to distract idiots."
1,Cheap Looking,"I purchased this for a gift based upon a review of the product in black. Admittedly, I didn't try the product - once I opened the box, the ""chrome"" version looked so cheap! This chrome version is made of plastic, so the chrome is just silvery plastic, not metal or stainless steel. While the product might work, the chrome version looked too cheap for me, so I returned it."
3,"Interesting read, but not always accurate","This book is a dense collection of information about various aspects of reversing.There are a few factual errors, and so, while this book can be used for bed-time reading, I wouldn't count on it as a reference.Before people pounce on me for mentioning 'factual errors' and not substantiating them, let me draw their attention to the description of calling conventions in this book. This book mentions that cdecl and stdcall pass arguments in different orders (i.e left to right for cdecl and right to left for stdcall). This is just plain wrong. I wonder how this important detail could not be caught during editing, and technical review."
5,Good introduction book for beginners,I was looking for a book that would teach the basics of reverse engineering. I am a software developer and some times I need to find out how a specific program works and this book has proved very useful.
4,Beware of Technical Errors...,"While the author gives a lot of useful high-level information about reverse engineering, he makes some fairly blatant errors from time to time when it comes to details. These errors are scattered throughout the book, and don't seem to be specific to any one topic. I suspect it may just be a matter of fast writing, poor editing, and a lack of diligence on the part of the technical reviewers. In any event, it's a good idea to have a secondary source of information available to verify what the author says."
3,Does not include 64-bit processors and OSs,"I was disappointed that a book of this type does not cover 64-bit computing.I've had a 64-bit CPU in my PC since 2003 so it should have been included here.I don't think you can even buy a non-64-bit processor nowadays. Maybe a second edition could include this ?Otherwise, it is a good book."
5,Do-It-Yourself Faux Finishing,In January I got my copy of the video after seeing the video clip on www.fauxfinished.com. I don't like to buy without a sample of what I'm getting. The video made the different techniques easier because of the details covered. Since then I have had fun fauxing 2 rooms and I must say they look great.
2,"Good Band, Bad Album","Little Feat is my all time favorite band and Factory is Lowell's pre-Feat band with some of the Feat members already playing in it. To me it was such a surprise how much the band has developed between the recording of this album (=Frank Zappa produced demos) and the first official Little Feat album. The difference is like night and day. And unfortunately for this album but this one is the night in that case. Surprisingly bad album from such superb musicians. Thankfully there's a couple of tunes here that rise almost to the level of the first Feat album but other than those couple tracks listening to this album is a drag. But we all have to start from somewhere and since this is where the Little Feat started from to me this is pretty much like Jerusalem to the Christians: A holy place where only few of us ever go... And if you don't go for this, you don't miss a thing. Go for any other Little Feat / Lowell George album instead and you're doing yourself a great big favour."
3,Works fine but....,this thing is way to easy to turn on. My husband has burned through so many batteries on this thing because all it takes is bumping the switch that sticks out for it to turn on. So if you have it in a bag or a pocket it will turn on without you knowing it. Otherwise it's decent. The sounds quality is good and I found it fairly easy to use.
1,Bad Item,"I tried to figure out how to work this MP3 player for the last 3h. The instructions with this MP3 player are not saying what the player is doing. So, it was too hard to figure out how to work this thing. There are plenty of other MP3 players out there with easier instructions. So, the item was returned after owing it half a day."
3,Macvision 256mb MP3,All in all not a bad product. However documentation is a bit difficult to understand. The hardest part to get use to with this product is mastering moving through the menu's but other than that very satisfied. I would buy again.
1,Whoops,"Although a good price, the MA833A-2B was not compatable with the most of my WMA files. Navigating the directions and downloads was a 2-hour lesson in futility. The product was returned."
2,Customer service is crap,"I have no problems with the product itself. I purchased 3 of them for Christmas and of the three, one of the clips that hold the device to the earphones didnt work. Ive tried contacting their customer service dept and what I got was an auto response email saying that they would contact you within 48 hrs. Well its February and I still havent heard from them. My kid managed to damage the glass display and Im trying to get it repaired or replace the unit...but again....no response (other that the automated email response). So I guess that you can say and from what Ive read, when they work, they work well, but if you have a problem that requires customer service...You'er S.O.L."
3,"Best for lovers of ""Live"" albums","This cd (actually 2 cds: ""High In The Sky"" and ""Hello Suzie"", ""all tracks are the original Immediate recording"") was somewhat of a surprise, as it turned out to be mostly a live album, not the studio tracks I was expecting. It contains all of Amen Corner's hits and more, and if you want to have a taste of what it was like to see them in concert, then this cd will satisfy. However, if you are looking for a basic, original recording Greatest Hits cd then this is perhaps not the one for you."
3,There are better ones around,"The laser light is fine on this pointer, but the black plastic feels cheap. It is also flat on one side, which makes holding it very uncomfortable. I lost mine and bought a much better one on Ebay for much less money."
1,what a joke,"200 bucks for this are you serious... awesome and amazing band, but come on. Not even their best album. Ridiculously over priced, even if the band goes down in the record books their vinyl will still never be worth that much. Really disappointed to see someone trying to take advantage of such a pure and amazing band. You suck for trying to exploit the love this band created."
3,Pass the Barleycorn,"I picked the book expecting more of an autobiograpy or memoir, but wasn't entirely disapointed by the content. To say this guy lived an interesting life would be an understatement in my opinion, whether the story was fictional or not. It was an interesting read and helped to open my eyes to the time period and how alcohol was interwoven in society. By the end of the book I was worn out from trying to convince myself that Jack London was saying something worthwhile."
4,As honest as he could have been at the time!,I was very pleased with the purchase. I never read any thing like it. I will buy another title from Jack London.
5,John Barleycorn,I have been looking for a copy of 'John Barleycorn' for some time. It is a good insight of what Alcholism was like before Bill W and Dr. Bob came along. I am going to purchase two more copies to pass on to the two group meetings I attend.
5,John Barleycorn by Jack London,"If you want to know about Jack London, this is the book to read! He talks about many events and adventures in life with his not so nice buddy, John Barleycorn(whisky). The book can be a lot of fun as he talks about his adventures when he was young and yet it's very sad in other areas regarding the loss of many of his friends due to alcoholism. And the book is disturbing how his thinking becomes haunted and depressed as he becomes a serious drinker when he is older. He tries very hard throughout the book to fight John Barleycorn and his strength, honesty and sincerity is an inspiration. I couldn't help but compare this book to Craig Fergeson's American on Purpose book. It's extremely amazing to find these guys rise out of the clutches of John Barleycorn."
4,John Barleycorn a must for all drinkers,"I really enjoyed this book. It is an intelligent and humorous view of a drinkers experiences, and we all know how entertaining Jack London's experiences were. This book is basically an autobiography of Jack London with an emphasis on his ""drinking career"". A classic that shouldn't be over looked."
3,Smells like...,"The consistency is light to medium. It goes on light, which I like. The only problem is the smell. It smells like feet or cornnuts. I can't exactly put my finger on it, but it's something I can't seem to get past. I would think the person who decides on the fragrance would have turned down the smell of cornnuts being put in your face. Ughh...definitely would not buy this again."
4,"Great, but not the best","I really want to love this moisturizer. It's rich without being oily and it doesn't have much of a scent to it. I really like the product packaging -- you squeeze it out sort of like toothpaste, not your average pump -- so I feel like I will be able to use it until the last drop. Also, unlike another reviewer, I think 2 oz. is a generous size and plenty.But for $32 I just expect it to knock my socks off and it doesn't. I actually miss my winter moisturizer (Alba Botanica Sea Moss) that is less than half the price. Bottom line: I like it, but I don't love it (and won't be buying again.)"
5,Love this key chain !,"It's a very nice key chain , it's durable and of course very cool looking.It will get a bit dirty over time but you can easily clean it with a bottle of hand sanitizer and it will look brand new.Could probably use soap and water too but the alcohol base of the hand sanitizer does a good job."
3,a classic in the field,"Even though the term ""erotic perfumes"" may lead many to the wrongful conclusion that scents like ambergris and civet act as pheromones in humans-a supposition which scientific research doesn't back up-overall this is a good book from an historical and anthropological standpoint, in that it retraces the importance fragrances have had in social interactions. Groundbreaking for its time, despite some errors, the aromatic substances mentioned by Bloch are still as pervasive in the perfume trade as they were at the time of his book. An excellent primer!"
5,A Great Preforrmer,I got to know Pat Dailey's Music from Watching the him preform at Sloppy Joes Bar Through the Sloppy Webcam. Just by Watching that I said to my self this guys a great preformer. http://www.sloppyjoes.com
4,A Christmas gift.,Functional and attractive - wish it came in other colors so it could go better with kitchen decor. A handy size.
5,I'm Impressed!,"This arrived very fast. First thing I noticed is the size, much larger than my other keepers. Nice styling to it too and came well packaged. This is a step up to some of the other keepers and by far the largest one I own. Excellent product and I would recommend this to anyone wanting a larger keeper."
1,Broken stoneware garlic keeper,"I have purchased many items from Amazon over the past few years. Usually, I only purchase books or dvds, but thought I would try purchasing the stoneware garlic keeper. Unfortunately, I have not been able to use because it was broken when it arrived!"
1,Item NOT as pictured!,I ordered this item because I wanted the removable head. This was SUPPOSED to be the OLD style Kitchenaid brush with the removable head. It is NOT! It is the new style which you can pick up at ANY local store. The whole reason I ordered it online is because I wanted the old style that is NOT available locally anymore.
3,just decent.,"Being a huge fan of the Kitchen Aid line I felt a little taken advantage of when I bought this. Sure it looks nice, but this product is exactly like every other BBQ turner on the market. If you want to keep a collection of Kitchen Aid products going, then this is a decent buy, however for the price it's deffinately not worth it. I reccomend going to the grocery store and buying the $3 turner's before spending $20 bucks on this one."
1,Is this really stainless steel,"To determine good stainless use the magnet test - magnets do not stick to the best stainless. It adheres to these utensils and it rusted in only two weeks of use. Oh well, I'll know better."
1,Distortion,Installation is simple but the distortion in the mirror is pitiful.The only useful area is the center.I am considering complaining to Amazon because this is a very poor quality mirror.
3,Madcap Comedy,"Her Husband's Affairs is a film about a man (Franchot Tone) whose hair brained schemes for selling strange items always land him in trouble. His wife (Lucille Ball) constantly tries to rectify the situation, often causing even more problems. When Tone advertises an amazing hair removal product created by his strange scientist friend, he thinks he is floating on air until it turns out that the product actually grows hair to the extreme.Franchot Tone is likable in this film, but his character constantly gets the short end of the stick. For this reason, the film is a bit frustrating.What is more frustrating is that Lucille Ball is smug when her character does something she thinks is right, a most undesirable trait.This film overall could have been better executed if the characters were more appealing to the audience."
1,Get what you pay for,"This MP3 player was a waste of time and money (fortunately only a little money). The control buttons are too small and the ""three lines"" of text require a magnifying glass to read. Worst of all, while the voice recording function did work, it would not store or playback any music files.The instruction booklet was written in very poor English and the instructions provided were so brief that even when the poor English could be deciphered they were useless. Online ""help"" is nonexistent. The only saving grace of this MP3 was that it cost very little.This ""MP3 player"" is not recommended at any price; even if another was offered to me for free I would not accept it."
4,Distributed Algorithms,"Je trouve à M. Tel le matre des algorithmes distribués. Les concepts sont précis et bien documentés. Le livre est très complet, très claire et on peut trouver une extense bibliographie sur le sujet."
4,"Good, but not perfect","I really love this dish. It cooks good very evenly and it is pretty. However, if you are looking for a dish with no flaws (as a gift, etc.) then you may want to avoid getting Emile Henry items on Amazon. I've ordered quite a few items (pie pans and other dishes) and my experience has been that there are minor imperfections in them. This particular pan arrived with thick glaze drippings cooked into the side. While I am the only one who will probably notice that, it still bothers me. I think that if Emile Henry is going to sell items that are ""less than perfect"" for lower price then they should advertise as so. Rather, they make you think that you are getting the same kind of dish that you would get at the store, but that just isn't true."
3,Good book,The book was chosen due to my English class which I am taking at college. I think it was an interesting book.
1,Someone has CREATED 5 star ratings to FOOL YOU,Amazon needs to find a way to PREVENT immoral people from CREATING FALSE REVIEWS IN ORDER TO SELL THEIR PRODUCT. The 5 star reviews on this product have been written to MISLEAD people.Be aware. Do your research. This is ridiculous.
5,Love that music,I love listening to music without voices and this is great because I know the songs.
4,This Item sort of worked for me,"Got this because my new motherboard had a ""combination"" mouse and Keyboard jack. I thourght this would allow me to use my ps2 mouse and keyboard. Turns out only the keyboard works. Seems the mother board doesn't support both, so I don't know if this adapter works or not."
1,Buyer Beware!,"As a product like this is the build looks good,but beware! I am not singling out this manufacturer alone, but all I investigated.This type of ""Y"" jack design I found all have a six pin output (none having an eight pin plug). They all were retailed at prices of $1.99 to about $20. I thought $5.00 was a worthwhile amount to take a chance with, even though my new mother board has an eight pin plug.When the item arrived it of course wouldn't work. How silly to believe an offer of a six pin adapter would work! So don't bother to take a chance.My amazement is why are these adapters even offered if the single PS2 plugs available on desktop motherboards have eight pin connectivity. (You will see upon observation that both the PS2 mouse and keyboard have four pins each.Summing up to one plug with eight pins.)Should anyone find a ""Y"" jack with an eight pin connector, I'm listening.>>Disheartened!"
2,"Didn't work, but found another solution","Was unable to get it to work with my setup (Windows 7 [64-bit] / ASUS M4A88TD-V EVO/USB3 M/B), but the item below USB version worked:[...]It goes from PS/2 to USB though rather than PS/2 to PS/2, but I'm running OK with it.I rated it a 2 because although it doesn't work for me, I got a full refund which was a breath of fresh air."
2,Disappointing second book in series,"The first book in this series, The Milagro Beanfield War, was so powerful that I was excited to read the other two. This second book was a big disappointment and I'm not bothering to order the third one.Why would an author who was capable of writing a book which was a powerful social statement with strong personal relationship development and lots of humor in it think he must do stupid graphic sex scenes in succeeding books? The whole book was terribly disappointing.Read the first one. Then quit."
2,One long bummer,"The Magic Journey holds out the promise of being as enchanting and rewarding as ""Milagro Beanfield War"", but turns into a huge disappointment. It is almost unrelievedly negative, concluding with the heroine dying to no avail. As a wise man once said, ""Nothing is more boring than someone else's dreams"", and in Magic Journey Nichols burns page after page of our patience recounting dreams that the characters have had. The has the effect of bringing the story to a screeching halt. And these characters are already aggravating. If they're not evil geniuses they're do-nothing good guys. I realize very few books can stand up to comparison with Milagro, but as the second book of the ""New Mexico Trilogy"", I was hoping that ""Magic Journey"" would at least be a pleasant read. Sadly, it's not."
4,Very thorough!!,This is an extremely thorough book on Nigeria. It will provide almost any information you need or want to know. Well done!
4,Creepy and amazing!,One of my favorite documentaries. Very creepy look inside the Family. Highly recommended.
3,Excellent reference tool,"Mulligan's Bar Guide contains a nice selection of over 150 cocktails, but really makes it's mark with over 200 of today's most popular shooters. With such useful, yet playful sections as foreign greetings, toasts, and the ever popular 1000 Reasons to Celebrate, Mulligan's bar guide will serve you best if you take his advice and hand it on the bar. Hole included."
2,"Some good, some bad, and some ugly","This collection has its share of great songs. I love ""Fremder Mann,"" ""Er gehoert zu mir"", ""Fuer Immer Wie Heute"" and especially ""Lieder der Nacht."" All are great pop tunes with catchy beats. ""In Meinem Kalendar"" is a very cute song, in both lyrics and tune, well suited to the perky happy sound of Rosenberg's voice. But Rosenberg sort of reminds me of Britney Spears in that she can be relied upon not to screw up a song that is a hit on its own, but her voice does not really stand by itself in weaker songs. Unfortunately, most of the collection is composed of these. Rosenberg's voice is very high and very thin and begins to wear on me, particularly through songs with sparse accompaniment. Another weakness in the set is that it doesn't include lyrics, which is a real downside for me, because I picked it up at least in part because I study German. Overall, I'd say you're better off buying a smaller hit collection, because a lot of this is just skippage."
2,Not what I was looking for,"Looks really hip and cool, with the blue enamel and steel. It's actually very cute, and tough. However, The capacity's pretty small. I'm trying to think of someone to give it to, who lives in say a studio apartment, with small-capacity sinks, and I think it'd be a perfect fit."
5,Very good,"This was a gift for my husband for Father's Day and he loved it. He grills a lot and just wanted a set of tools together, this case is great with holding everything in one place. Also, the tools were sturdy and do the job they are intended to do. The only thing I didn't like as much was the basting brush...but unless you get one with permanent silicone tips no brush will last forever."
2,Cheap,Get what you pay for. I saw this at a local store for 20% cheaper. Why do I have to write 5 word? One describes it - cheap.
2,Poor quality,"For the price of the product, I guess it's ok. I received the product and the wood on one of the tools was chipped. It would be ok if I were using it myself but I bought it as a gift and that's just not ok."
5,A very nice set.,This is a very nice BBQ tool set. I gave it as a gift and it was well received. It looks plenty durable but time will tell.
3,Good starter set,"I would recommend this to someone that isn't to serious about grilling. The case is really poor quality, but the tools are actually decent for the price."
2,Not Made in the USA,"Product description said ""Made in the USA"", but when it arrived it said ""Made in China"" all over case and each individual piece. I returned it without using. For $20 or less I can get a crappy barbeque set made in China. I don't care what the brand name is."
4,Mr. Bar-B-Q Tool set,Best set I've ever had. I only give it 4 stars because good luck trying to put everything back and closing it again. So plan on never using the case again. The tools are strong built and the quality is fantastic. The brush is the first thing to wear out. You would have to bend the tangs after a year of use or so. I wish they replace the brush with a smaller 2nd. tangs that would be excellent.
1,The worst BBQ Set EVER !,"cheaply made, rusts fastly, the rubber handles peels off after couple of usage.........you can definitelt buy better and cheaper from the $-Store, Marshalls and ROSS."
2,Lower quality than expected,"I recieved this kit with a smashed case. The quality of this product was far below what I expected for the price. I had to return this product for 2 reasons, damaged and low quality."
4,Great value for the money,"So far so good, the only complain i have is with respect to the wire bruch which has very short brizzles and since the handle is straight and not angled when cleaning or scrubbing the hot grill it is a real pain with the heat from the grill. You will need a heat resistant glove when using it."
1,NOT made in USA,"This set was specifically ordered because the product information indicated it is ""Made in USA."" We were disappointed to receive the set today and see on the box ""Made in China."" We are not interested in supporting a Communist regime! We will be returning the set shortly."
4,chill out music for grown ups!,"Amazingly sensual and soft, this first offering went largely unnoticed by all but the most ardent Tears for Fears,Cyndi Lauper and Lloyd Cole fans (Nicky had been working with these artists). Lloyd Cole co-wrote and guested on ""Ladykiller"" which is deceptively pretty but equates the ""player"" with the psycopath (and how far apart are they for that matter?). The Night We Never Met is a synopsis of the film by the same name. Been a while since I've heard this one, but I can recommend it for romantics! Nicky has vast musical talents and deserves a much wider audience. She covered Dusty and I didn't hate it (that's praise from a hardcore Dusty fan, believe me!). Worth a listen, for sure."
3,Ok but not her best stuff,"I bought this for my wife who loves Queens of comedy (I didn't think it was that funny), but anyway Adele has a few moments where her material is funny, but overall it's lacking."
5,nice and compact,"THis is a great little pointer,fits in my pocket and in my book bag.It fits in with my pens and alot easier to follow then with the laser ones."
2,Pointers,These are very hard to find. Cannot find them in any office supply store. Most stores promote laser pointers.We coach students on computers and these are handy so that our coaches do not have to lean over students. They can use the pointers to point where a student is supposed to click. Great prince and sturdy.
4,good product,"This does what it says it does. Works gretty good.OK. It is a little light construction, and not so rigid, so only 4 stars."
3,"Good, but...",I purchased this to replace another of the same make because the end simply pulled out of the body. I'll try to be more careful with this one.
3,Fragile Find,My daughter purchased this pointer with some Christmas money. She wanted it to play school. It lasted two days before the extension broke off the end. She now wants a new pointer.
3,good book with bad ink,"This book is very good in contents, my son love it. But it emits an obvious chemical smell. I am afraid that this chemical will damage my son's health, so I decide to return it to the store."
2,thumbs down,"the book is full of information, but the copy I received in the mail is pure crap. They should make sellers put pics of the condition of their books because it was not a good copy at all."
5,Awesome for the Price!!,"Unfortunately I have two youngsters who put the dishes away and tend to drop pans. All of our springform pans have been bent and leaky with their less than tender handling! I bought this for my husband and am enjoying many cheesecakes since...It is lovely, and the cake doesn't stick to the pan!"
4,Better Mouse Trap,"I had previously used an ACE brand tennis elbow strap. I use the tennis elbow strap to provide support when I exercise and lift weights, the action of pulling towards my body aggravates my tendonitis. As I start to sweat the ACE brand tennis elbow strap would slide and move from its position on my arm. The Champion Neoprene Tennis Elbow Strap stays in place. The ACE brand tennis elbow strap had a removable pressure pad which is secured by a velcro strap glued to the plastic pad. The glue failed over time making the tennis elbow strap useless. I like the fact that the pressure pad is sewn into place on the Champion Neoprene Tennis Elbow Strap making it a permanent part of the strap. My only dislike is the velcro strap that secures the neoprene band around my forearm. The top half of the velcro strap that attaches to bottom half is exactly the same size. If I do not precisely place the two velcro components together then a portion of the velcro pinches my arm when I flex it."
4,Best One So Far,"I have purchased three different tennis elbow straps and this one, by Champion, is the best of the bunch. It's far more substantial and durable than the others, including one provided by my orthopedic clinic. The design makes it the most comfortable I've tried and it fits under a dress shirt in case you need to wear all day and at work."
3,Does the job,Not much to say about this type of item. Pretty simple and straight forward. It seems to do what I expected and I have no other experience to compare.
1,Look somewhere else if you need a strap,"This just slid down my arm. The elbow strap I got from my doctor's office was way better and did provide me relief. This on the other hand, the minute I tried it on, it was uncomfortable, slid down my arm and the material was a bit rough (not good if you have sensitive/delicate skin)."
3,Inegal,"Un entomologiste egyptien se marie avec une journaliste dont il aura une fille qui s'appellera Béatrice. Ayant découvert au Caire, Naples, Istambul...des fèves de scarabée, consommées dans le but d'assurer une descendance uniquement masculine, la journaliste parcourt le monde pour tenter de dénoncer ce qu'elle anticipe comme étant la pire catastrophe de ce siècle: la raréfaction des filles. Le couple s'aperoit alors que le phénomène s'etend en Chine, en Inde et ailleurs....A l'échelle mondiale, un vaccin anti-fille est mis au point conduisant non seulement à un déséquilibre démographique général, mais également à un déséquilibre économique, politique et social universel.Un roman qui est le combat vain d'un couple contre le cours de l'histoire.Une fable bien écrite mais qui s'essouffle dans la seconde partie de l'ouvrage."
4,Amazing books,LOve this series of kids books. The images are fun and funny and the comparisons are cute. Big Little and Yummy Yucky were his favorite books around 9 months.
5,great for young babies,"I bought 3 of these books (quiet loud, big little, yummy yucky) because my friend recommended them and my 5 month old daughter loves them. She gets very quiet and still, stares at the pictures of the little baby on each page and likes to touch the page and try to help us turn the page."
3,A Cave-In in a Mining Town,"Thor is a little mining town in Michigan. The whole town, from top to bottom, depends on the mine. In this book, Armstrong takes a look at several different families, with all kinds of relationships, and then examines what happens when a mine caves in, trapping 5 men. All kinds of tensions and drama erupt in the little community while they wait to see who will emerge from underground alive.I enjoyed this story. Sometimes the dialogue was a little hard to follow, but the portrait of an older time was a convincing one. I wasn't quite clear on exactly when this was supposed to be set, but certainly times have changed. Still, just last year, here in Utah we had another cave in, and the drama and emotion while the whole town waited, holding their breath, that tension has not changed. Good solid book.Oh, and ignore the lurid cover! I thought this was a Gothic romance, but it was not what I expected at all."
1,maybe it cuts soft things?,"wouldn't cut a potato or sweet potato. i guess it cut a cucumber OK, but was kind of a mess."
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,"I've always had great faith in the KitchenAid brand but this thing is a total waste of money. When I tried to use it to cut through a potato, I thought that I must be doing something wrong because nothing should be this difficult. So, my husband tried. Even he couldn't get it to cut properly. If you find a potato that won't disintegrate while you're trying to cut it with this gadget then you have one very tough potato and if you can find a man who can get this thing to slice through a potato properly then marry him because he's a real he-man! I simply don't know anyone strong enough to make these dull blades slice through any potato on earth. A french fry cutter is useless if it won't slice a potato and if I want an apple slicer I can buy one for $2-$3. I wouldn't waste my money on this one."
5,Awesome,I love making french fries now so easier! I had to buy two more for my relative. This is a great gift.
1,Don't toss your knife & cutting board,"This slicer seems easy enough and is easy to clean. Hard part is you have to press the blade over the food to be sliced. Potatoes and most foods used with this tool are oval shaped and do not stand up on end without slicing them. Once you have gotten the slicer over the food, you have to press it through the slicer sections manually. It is a better idea to get the box style cutter for about the same cost which is easier to use, has a shaped press to push the food through the blades and dishwasher safe too! I wish I had not found this item first."
1,Only lasted 2 months,"The apple slicer only lasted 2 months and then it completely broke apart going through an apple yesterday. I really liked it before that, but the quality is seriously lacking...can't even believe KitchenAid put their name on it."
2,Save your money,Too much work to be worth while. Tried to cut red potatoes with it and wound up with bruised knuckles & potato stuck in the holes. It's easier to slice them with a knife.
2,Hard to use,"I bought this to make french fries with potatoes and sweet potatoes. I almost had to jump up and down on it to get the sweet potato in there, but then the slices are jammed in there. Potatoes are a little easier, still difficult to use."
1,Nice big handles didn't cut my french fries. Buying frozen fries is easier..,"The big impressive handle is fine. However this gadget did not earn my cupboard space.However a closer look reveals dull nicked cutters that are attatched to hollow plastic holders or cutting dies.I tried making french fries. The potato just gets stuck half way through and I really pushed my weight onto it.Furthermore there is no chessboard like plastic pusher with grooves to mate with the cutter to finish pushing the potato through.Food gets into the hollow areas making cutters both fun to wash and dry.With only 1-3 grams of fat and some sodium, I'm buying frozen fries from the grocery store. I will continue to use my tube shaped apple corer with handle."
3,Wolverine Boots,"They are great at keeping your feet dry, but they are not as warm or as comfortable as I thought they would be."
4,Looking forward to the next one,Elizabeth is a great character because she starts out as a strong person who is happy with a life that most of her fellow character look down on - but she doesn't sell out to anyone. Gillespie has written her so that the reader looks forward to visiting with her again - in the next books. I do wish we could have seen more of Timothy before the proposal - they seem like a cute couple it just needs more details. I also wish we could have seen the wedding - that could have been so funny! I read on the author's website that her agent & publisher made her rewrite several times...I don't know if the author had more details before the rewrites - but I hope they all know that readers can handle 350+ page books even in a series.
2,mildly entertaining,"After reading the other reviews on this book, I thought I would try the series. I am glad I only bought the one book as I found it only mildly entertaining and had to force myself to finish it."
2,Bottom of the barrel,"If you are trapped on a long international flight or at the dentists office you might want to read it, otherwise move on. The characters are so simple-minded you don't care what happens to them and the story so predictable you can skip chapters and still know what's going on. I know summer books are the easy reads and follow tried and true formulas, but you still need something to sink your teeth into and this is where the book fails. We don't get a charming town with a neat or colorful history, instead we get a hillbilly outpost where no one is aware there is a world outside their zip code. We don't have a character that we really want to root for, because they are all so ignorant they should be happy with the life they've got. And the humor falls flat because it is cliched and leans on old sterotypes. It takes alot of talent to write comedies about the South, and it takes alot of nerve to write it when you aren't from the South. A least the author has nerve."
2,"Blah, blah, blah","I received an ARC of this book out of the blue, so what the heck, I read it. Other than the quotes at the beginning of each chapter (which I enjoyed), this book is nothing special. The characters are all sweet but very much stereotypes with no real depth or individuality. Overall reading this book affected me similarly to receiving novacaine at the dentist--dull and numbing."
2,Mediocre at best,"The book is a quick read and does have a few entertaining moments, but not enough to make up for the book's shortcomings. The characters are superficial and don't really come to life. I agree with the two other reviewers who said the southernism are exaggerated. I was so annoyed that people in other regions of the country would read this and laugh because they think that is how we are that I could barely finish the book. Are the five star reviews written by family and firends??? There is alot of plot action, but it is cutesy and so easily wrapped up that we don't care. I was unconvinced by the writing and weak story line. With the characters being so superficial, I can't imagine how the author plans to get more books out of this."
5,Terrific Southern and Summer Read!,"I received Bet Your Bottom Dollar as an ARC a few weeks ago and I absolutely LOVED it. In three days, I have read over 200 pages which is a record for me with a new house and a baby on the way! The characters are just terrific and I love the sayings at the beginnings of each chapter, especially the bumper stickers and the church ones.Timothy is a fantastic character and I love how he finally came around to tell Elizabeth how he feels after a little prodding! It does remind me of a bit of Fried Green Tomatoes (the comparison I had read somewhere) but also reminds me of Big Stone Gap books (by Adriana Trigiani)--I love those as well!I even wrote to the author and I am really pleased to know she already has 2 more books like these in the pipeline. She seemed quite appreciative that people were reading her books and I can't wait till the sequel comes out!Lorraine"
2,"Pleasant story about nice people in the South, but not recommended.","Based on other reviewers, I was hoping for romantic comedy, but got neither. I didn't laugh or chuckle. I wasn't surprised or delighted. The relationship that developed did not draw me in enough emotionally to be able to categorize this as a romance novel. Some of the plot points concerned family secrets, which were somewhat predictable. The characters were not interesting enough.Story brief: Smart, nice and humble girl Elizabeth helps solve problems for people in the small town of Cayboo Creek. A wealthy woman in nearby Augusta, Georgia, asks Elizabeth to be a friend to her grandson, Timothy, a Buddhist oddball who recently moved back to town after his father's death. Sexual language: none. Number of sex scenes: none. Setting: current day Cayboo Creek, S. Carolina. Copyright: 2005. Genre: human relationships fiction."
1,A true feel good book!,This group of 'down home' folks will be sure to warm your heart and keep you laughing. Don't be surprised if you can't put the book down and can't wait for the next book (hopefully) to come out!
3,"A short, fun read","To all those indignant about the over-done Southern characterizations in this book, you need to relax. This is not Faulkner or Flannery O'Connor. It's a fun, light beach read, and i knew that going into it, so i enjoyed reading it. Don't have high expectations of this book and you'll enjoy the humor and the plot.Elizabeth is a fine character, and I look forward to seeing her develop more in the next book (this is the first in a series, apparently). The banter and dialogue is written well, and if there are some generalizations about poor Southerners, at least the author doesn't resort to dialect. I did get tired of Elizabeth's father and stepmother, they seemed way too one-dimensional and just annoying.This is not a deep, involving novel. Instead it's a light, fluffy, ""lower class girl makes good"" tale, so take it as such. I'm looking forward to the next one for some light reading."
2,I'll never get the time back that I spent reading this book.,"I would've rated this book one star except that I THINK the author has some potential for improvement.I agree with the assessment of many who have written reviews here in that the characters are one-dimensional, the plot was plodding, and the description of Southern life seemed over-the-top.I also think it is presumptuous for the author to assume she is going to have enough of a following from her very first book to call it the first of a series. I for one have no intention of revisiting ""Cayboo Creek"" again."
4,excellent product,"This is the 2nd. 100 pack I have purchased, and I love the convenience and the value. It amazes me how often I need to ""case up"" a cd or a dvd, and how fast I go through these things!"
4,Works well,"The product was reasonably priced and does the job. It came promptly. I think I prefer the more expensive version where you can put a label on the edge, but that's a matter of taste."
3,Slimline Crystal Case,"These are quite flimsy. They do work for your CD's or DVD's but they do not close very well and have a ""cheap"" feel to them. I would recommend against these is you are getting into the case often."
4,Good Value and Saves on Mailing Postage (Less Protective Packaging Needed),"The heavier backing on these jewel cases make these more suitable for normal shipper handling and USPS mailing (in 20 yearsI have only had on case arrive broken but the disc survived). Also, the less brittle black disc bed means that bulk orders of 100 to a case arrive with fewer cracks are other such damage from rough-shipping practices (unlike the cheap brittle clear slimline cases). The manufacturer for this product is a reputable and square-dealing outfit in my experience. Too, I've been a CD-DVD duplicator for two decade and have played a lot of games with blank media vendors and jewel case vendors, so believe me when I say this is a good product for mailing disc in light packaging (that save on postage costs even!)."
1,Not expecting much but still disappointed . . .,"I bought these for my four-year old son thinking that the low magnification (4x) and large exit pupil (7.5 mm) would make it easier for him to spot things, focus in, etc. Boy was I wrong. These things are virtually worthless--I'd send them back but don't want to waste money on shipping. The field of view is miniscule which makes looking through these binocs akin to looking through a couple of drinking straws--there are a lot of blurry, obscure things on the periphery and not much shows up in the center. (...)Frankly, I'm shocked that a quality company like Meade puts its name on a product like this."
4,Great binoculars for a basic viewing,"PROS-Great for bringing to a sporting event or theatre event.-Can be worn around the neck-Comes with a simple cleaner napkinCONS-May not satisify hardcore sight seers-Not intented for long-range viewing-Vision width is relatively small and therefore can be tiring to view through the binoculars for more then a minute.Bottom LineThis is a great pair of binoculars to bring to any place you think their might be interesting sights. However, some users may get tired using the binoculars for extended periods of times. There are better binoculars."
