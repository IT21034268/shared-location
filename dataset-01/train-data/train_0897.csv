2,-,"Every time I brought the mud(the larger size) elsewhere it would include sponge as a gift, but I didnot recieve it here. The mud is good though."
5,seems good,"I Just used it once last night, it seems to be good! It is a big bottle. I am not sure if I should keep on using other lotion and cream after using this facial mud."
2,Not really sure about this one,I bought it from Costco. It was a good price. But I don't know what it suppose to do for your skin.My skin feel the same after use and it itches during usage. Anyone else?
5,love it!!,really nice product! i have been keeping using the product every week!!!my skin is really clean after used it.love it!!!would recommand it to everyone!!!
4,Quality facial product,"I am fan of face masques because they make my tired face feel refreshed and rejuvenated feeling and this product is one of the best I have tried so far. I have tried various other brands before, but some take a long time to dry, others become itchy as they dry, but Borhese is comfortable to wear and the consistency makes application and clean up easy. Mine came with an applicator sponge, but I feel that I would waste too much and just use my fingers to apply it. Like other reviewers I have noticed some skin sensativity after use, but applying a nice moisturizer with shea butter usually takes care of the problem quickly. This item comes in a very attractive box and so would also make a nice gift that is easy to wrap. I like the glass jar much better than other brands that come in a tube because it is easier to use and you need only take how much you need at a time preventing waste."
3,"Good Product, but not for me","Borghese mud mask is good deep cleansing product. but work just okay with my skin.I have combination skin type, oily in T zone and dry in U zone. I feel little bit dry after used the mask.So, I guess this product might good for oily skin people."
4,great product,"have been using this mask for 20+ years at least 2x per month, and works wonders for my complection. It used to cost $50.00 at department stores."
2,hmmmmm,dunno why but my feels itch everytime I use this product. just purchased from costco to give it a try but.. eh.. I don't think this product is helping at all.
4,An education,"A well written and researched book.Packed with facts and astonishing information on Germany's, ahead of their time aircraft, and the beurocracy that surrounded them. This book certainly proves that necessity is the mother of invention. What would have happened had the German efforts come to fruition? We can perhaps only ever have an incling on how close they were to success. Heartily recomended!"
2,Inconsistent,"I ordered 3 of these, pink, yellow and white at a good price, and the material was great. My disappointment is in the inconsistency of the neck. Only 1 of the 3 fit right around my neck, the other two gapped and looked very bad. A turtleneck is to fit comforately snug around ones neck. I even washed and put in the dryer to see if that would make a difference, it did not. If I cannot return the 2, they will not be a bargan, but end up being a very expensive turtleneck."
1,turtlneck,"it wasnt the color it was suppose to be ,the color was way to light it looked more like off white than yellow"
3,Not what I thought,"I was really hoping the author would give ideas on how to raise our daughters to be His girl. Instead it was proof after proof that the media/magazines etc put out the wrong message. I am already sold on that! I struggle with Christian moms who still knowing all this info can't say no to their daughters. I want help on what to say/do? I am now reading ""5 conversations to have with your daughter"" by Vicki Courtney and hope this book will offer the advice I am seeking from a Christian mother."
1,Your Girl: Raising a Godly Daughter in an Ungodly World,I was very disappointed in this book. Too much scripture and not enough advice.
5,Great Book...,Great book with great insight into trying to raise your child to live a Christian life in a every becoming non Christian world.
5,Hop! Plop!,"I am a child and family therapist as well as a mother of 3 year old twins and a 5 year old. I am a Mom first so when I first read this book I was so impressed with the concepts being taught behind the story of two friends whom appear to be from opposite worlds. As a professional who works with small children I can see myself using this book within play therapy to help teach problem solving, tolerance of personal and physical differences, how to make those differences be a positive not a negative and the benefits of compromise within relationships whether it be friends (as it was in the book) or family. It has wonderful lessons carefully woven throughout the delightful text and captivating illustrations. A must have for any pre-schooler. It is a daily request in our household."
5,Kid pleaser,"My daughter is only 2, but she's addicted to books and can't get enough. My wife and I choose them carefully to keep her engaged. When we read her Hop! Plop! for the first time, she stared at it wide-eyed until it was done, then shouted, ""Again!"" Pretty high praise. Now, it's minimum 3 times a day - she asks for it by name as a special treat - which it is."
5,Hop! Plop!,"What a fun book! Kids will learn about problem solving and working together (without even knowing it). The onomatopoeias (if that's how you spell and pluralize it) and the pictures make the book amusing and enjoyable. After reading it, my 4 years old and 2 year old (and I) were sliding down our own elephant trunks.I highly recommend it."
3,AAA,"I did not like the design much, nor did I enjoy the fact the the actual size was at least 1/2 a notch less than it was marked. The latter is my own fault, I should have read previous customer reviews prior to ordering."
5,Finally!,Finally a book that explains Bayesian stats in social science terms. Why should we care? How do we use this stuff? What does it do that couldn't be done otherwise? The examples are great because they use actual data that can be downloaded and run with supplied code. The theory is carefully explained and doesn't assume that readers have had years of math-stat. I particularly liked the introduction to MCMC tools.
2,disappointing,"This book is turgid, filled with minor & major errors, and generally useless--a real disappointment from Chapman & Hall/CRC which usually maintains high standards. I'm reading Gelman et al.'s Bayesian Data Analysis which is much superior."
2,"Quality varies, one might be good, and another bad...don't gamble with this one","I have purchased 2 of these chargers. The first one I bought worked perfectly for almost a year before I noticed it wasn't holding a charge longer than 5 minutes of camera 'on' time. I was so impressed with it's $25 quality that I decided to purchase another. They are the exact same battery, but the 2nd one that I purchased was a different color (it is green/black, not blue/black as pictured and what the 1st one I purchased looked like). Not sure if the color really matters, but in my case it did because this one lasted about 3 charges before it completely quit. The first battery I bought works better now than this new one does. I am very disappointed because I have always been very fond of Energizer. Don't gamble you will get a good one...purchase another brand."
4,"Basic History of Western Art, A (7th Edition)","It came within a reasonable time limit. The quality is good, I almost thought it was brand new. Worth the wait."
4,Fire it up,"Arrived in about a week, it was not the one pictured with the handles, but thats fine. Using it in my medium grill dome as a roasting rack."
2,You Get What You Pay For,"If your objective is to only have ""You Really Got Me"" on CD, buy this disc. But for a little better retrospective of the Kinks' early years, buy the Greatest Hits package on Rhino, which covers the years 1964-1966."
5,Very good production even though...,"Verdi - Don Carlo / von Karajan, Carreras, Baltsa, Furlanetto, d'Amico, Cappuccilli, Salminen, SalzburgA friend of mine who bought this DVD told me that the direction and acting were very good, but the sound and quality of the DVD were not. I agree with the first assessment but not completely with the second, it is true that the DVD is not HD production and of course the differences are noticed when an old production(before 2000)is compared with the new ones (after 2000).Although the scenery and color were good.I wasn't surprised with the acting-singing of Jose Carreras, Ferruccio Furlanetto, and Agnes Baltza,I know them from other performances, but the rest of the cast that I didn't know were also very good in particular Piero Capuccilli who played Rodrigo,Marchese di Posa.Karajan as a director and the orquestra were great, but it is also not a surprise.I can give 5 stars to this DVD."
3,fontaine ne boirai pas Ã  ton eau,"In my opinion the Fontainebleau scene (which is often omitted in many productions)impoverishes the whole opera. The story and the musical themes are all determined in that primal scene. That said, the opera is quite good. Furlanetto may not have had his infant wife's heart, but he sure steals mine in his solitary lamentation."
2,Miserably bad recording,"Whatever virtues this performance may have, I'll never be aware of them: the quality of the recording is so poor that I couldn't make it past the first scene."
3,okay but quality not really there...,didn't fit well on my sons bike. the microphone portion falls out of the holder alot. I took it off. wouldn't buy again
2,ALMOST JUNK!,"I BOUGHT ONE OF THESE ABOUT 7 YEARS AGO FOR MY WHEELCHAIR AND IT HAS WORKED GREAT UNTIL IT ACCIDENTALLY GOT BROKEN. WHEN I RE-ORDERED, WHAT CAME WAS JUNK! IT DIDN'T WORK RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX. THE COMPANY WAS VERY NICE AND REPLACED IT IMMEDIATELY. UNFORTUNATELY THAT ALSO WAS JUNK! IT WORKED FOR ABOUT 2 WEEKS THEN FELL APART-LITERALLY!!. SAD TO SAY BUT AS FAR AS I CAN SEARCH, THIS IS THE ONLY COMPANY THAT MAKES THESE TYPES OF HORNS, AND THEY ATTACH PERFECTLY TO MY WHEELCHAIR. I LIKE THEM BECAUSE OF THE DIFFERENT SOUNDS AND THEY ARE VERY LOUD TO GET PEOPLE OUT OF MY WAY. I ORDERED ANOTHER OUT OF NECESSITY AND AM PRAYING TO GOD I GET A DECENT ONE THIS TIME. IT WOULD BE WONDERFUL IF COMPANIES STILL TOOK THE TIME TO MANUFACTURE THINGS AS THEY DID YEARS AGO...TO LAST!"
5,Really COOL!,"Better then I expected. Siren sounds were very good. Functioned extremely well.Just the right amount of ""volume""... not too loud, yet very ""hearable"".You will not be disappointed with this product."
1,junk,i got 3 of these for my boys and only one worked well. One did not work at all. they are poorly put together made frm thin cheap plastic. For the price i expected more. DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!
1,Awful,Fell apart very quickly and the back snapped off the first time we tried to use it. The sound was distorted and sounded like the speaker was blown. As cheap as cheap can be. Overall: Horrible.
1,just not happy,"First the siren came and it was purple.Then inside one wire was dislocatedand stop working. Dad tape it back together. The siren part works great, but the mic was in and out"
1,Box has a cancer warning on it!!!!!,"Ok I was excited to buy two of these for our son and nephew for Easter but upon receiving them the box says ""Chemical is known to cause cancer in the state of California."" Not taking the chance of having my kid play with this thing so I am returning it. Not sure what the heck it means to me, but sounds like a red flag so a word of caution to fellow buyers."
1,Piece of Junk!,This thing is a piece of junk. It lasted for about 4 months then no amount of relocation did any good. False alarms like crazy! DO NOT BUY THIS THING!
1,Junk,This piece of junk gives false alarms all day long. Sometimes every few minutes like right now. We are out in the country and the monitor is 200 feet from the road and still it fires off all day long.
1,Do Not Buy!,"Wind and apparently, temperature changes, cause false alarms. Very annoying at night. Batteries have very short lifespan in cold weather which results in more alarms due to low battery state. Would not even give this system away because of the erratic behavior. Will try to recycle what I can. Come on, GE, where is your pride?"
1,"Yes, junk -- it's unanimous","Worked okay until the about the first change of batteries--four months or so. Wish I had sought out reviews before purchasing (Lowes, $59.00). I thought perhaps I was just unlucky until I found reviews (like these). It's all sad but true: Piece of junk. Constant false alarms, no matter how I position the sending or receiving unit. Beep-beep-beep-Beeeeeep! Now what the heck did I do with that receipt...?"
4,Works like a charm so far,"After reading all the negative reviews I was certain I was just throwing my money away, but it seem to be working flawlessly so far. I installed it 6' from the driveway, 350 feet away from my mom's house and she hasn't had a single false alert yet. It's been installed for about 3 weeks now. She couldn't be happier with it. And believe me I'd know if she wasn't. ;)"
1,Stay Away!,I went through 4 replacements before I finally returned the last for a refund. While each worked okay for various lengths of time (1 week through a couple of months) every one finally failed with constant false alarms. Don't waste your money.
5,Silence Dogood Funny and Timely Even Today,"I have not entirely finished this book, but what I have read so far has been fascinating and very well done. ""Silence Dogood"" was funny, thought provoking and timely even for today. Ben Franklin was a very intelligent and largely self-educated individual. Couldn't wait to order the volume with his autobiography and Poor Richard's Almanack."
5,As We Fall Is Awesome,Homemade is one of the greatest bands ever and i think that everyone needs this CD...NOW!
5,These women actually do rock,"I bought this tape for Sky Cries Mary and was excited to find that the other women on the compilation can wail. It is rare to find such a collection of women's voices in one place that are so utterly different from one to the next. The textures and tones are fabulous. The song writing for the most part is also very fun and well done. Only one ""song"" I could do without."
5,Very funny! Loads of laugh's.,"A very funny movie. A bit on the ""R"" side.If you like to laugh, you will like this movie!"
5,Quite hilarious,"This is a great comedy. The movie shows the story of a human couple, as told by an alien narrator who obviously has no idea what he's talking about. He tries to explain typical human courtship rituals from an outsider's perspective, speculating on the significance of each partner's actions exactly as a nature show narrator speculates on why animals do what they do. It's a light-hearted look at love, sure to make you laugh."
4,Very fun classic games,"This tin of classic card games was a fun trip down memory lane for me and four fun new games for my children. The cards are nice quality and should last for years. The only disappointment I had was the Mille Bournes cards had been changed to new graphics and I prefer the old classic look. If it was truly a classic card game, it should include the classic look, but maybe that's just a nostalgic wish."
5,The Rise and Fall,This book takes a very detailed and personal point of view starting with the author's decision to leave his telecom company and start a new one with several of his colleagues. You are taken through the entire progression of his company from basic foundations through to the IPO and subsequent collapse. It's a great story and discusses a lot of issues any entrepreneur needs to think about.
3,a bit confused,"I bought this series mostly due to to the fact that I had already read her World Gate series and liked it. However, this series left me a bit flat. Not sure why, maybe making to many comparisons between the two series. But a good read anyway."
4,Kitano wins the race,"I use this textbook with grad students in seminaries for designing interethnic ministries, largely African-American and Euro-American students. Kitano's exposition of principles and cases of racism provides an excellent backdrop for dealing with current situations in new churches in various societal settings, together with other textbooks."
2,Not like the first...,didn't expect it to be cheesy uptempo beats.didn't expect it to be cheesy uptempo beats.didn't expect it to be cheesy uptempo beats. (there - 12 words or more)
2,"Built cheap, baught cheap","There is a reason these wiper arms are cheap. They came out of the package with the paint already worn, they faded in 2 months and now they are showing some surface rust. Highly recommend you spend the money for a better product."
1,let's protect children from ignorance,"it is wonderful to want to protect children. but what the author is trying to protect them from is his own ignorance and fear. he obviously does not know enough about the earth religions to know and understand that there IS nothing to fear from them. although, anyone who has been brainwashed to believe teachings from one ancient, mythological source as ""the one true way"" would think that teachings from any other ancient source would be bad and wrong. this is his problem."
1,Rubbish,"Phew. Rubbish at its purest. I am a Wiccan and proud of it. This book aims to undermine our beautiful religion, and I strongly feel that a child - ANY child - should conciously choose their own faith. It is their right, and parents should do nothing to stay in their way. Christian, Buddhist, Muslim, Wiccan - let your child choose."
1,Seriously?,"I really don't know why I write a review for this pathetic narrow-minded thing. Just a TAD of logic..... you're learning about Wicca from a Fundamentalist Christian. Learn about Wicca from books that were written by people who are WICCAN. Then you can decide whether you need to ""protect your teens"" from this ""horrible witchcraft fad"". I'm just saying, if you're thinking about buying this, why protect your teens from expanding their spiritual nature, and learning about a positive nature based spirituality?I, personally, think that it is negative to read any book that downgrades ANY religion. I mean, what is the POINT? Half of the things you read will be biased lies. i'm not just saying this for this book, but for any book like this, even one like, ""Why Christianity is horrible and narrow minded and stupid"" (no I do not believe that, fyi)Blessed Be )O(Elyssa"
1,Funny huh?,"I wonder how the Christian community would feel if a Pagan wrote, ""Protecting Your Teen from Today's Christianity""?"
1,and I'm being generous with 1 star!,"""Protecting"" teens from Wicca? Give me a break. Wicca is an Earth based religion (yes, a true religion in America) and teaches to look for the good in everything and to never use spells for bad or malicy. True, there are variations of Witchcraft that aren't quite that happy-go-lucky and nice but they are the minority and are usually only ""practiced"" by uneducated kids that are just trying to get a rise out of society and their parents. Honestly, I think parents should be protecting their teens from ignorant witch hunting bible thumpers, not witches."
1,Helmets and armour!,"If you're looking for a book about the organisations, tactics or strategies of the Romans from Caesar to Trajan then don't bother with this book. This book is for those who want extremely detailed information about helmets and armour, and to a lesser extant swords and shields, for apart from that there is nothing. Also given how long ago this book was published, some of the work is outdated. A most disappointing book indeed."
3,I WANT MY OLD BOOTS BACK !!!,"When i first looked at the list of artists on the cd i thought that i was in for a real treat , how ever not one artist on the cd came close to the original.They might have if they were covering any one elses work. only Ian can do his songs , if any one else tries they ommit the accent , his warm voice and delivery that Ian had.Consequently the poetry , wit and sarcasam are lost to a muddle of noise.Dont take my word , by your own boots and panties"
4,"Good art, great writing.","Although fuller and more detailed watercolors are easy to find elsewhere, the art is good enough here to keep both toddlers and parents interested. The paintings are well composed, with emphasis on each item being named. It's also nice that everything is realistic (not idealized, not ""politically corrected""). The little verses are all good - no bad rhythms, no forced rhymes. Note that only capital letters are depicted, no lowercase. Overall it's very good, and earnestly written. My 2-year-old really likes it. He also likes Cowboy Dreams by Kathi Appelt."
1,still wondering,"I am a professional nanny & was truly excited to have found this book as a Christmas gift for my little charge, however I never received it! I am still wondering whatever happened to the book & why I couldn't get a refund!"
3,don't jump at the 242 in the title,"first off, if you found this searching for Front 242 DVDs - move on, nothing to see here... this is not related to the seminal EBM band from Belgium. however, if you like interesting video manipulations then this DVD might be in your future. while some of the segments are rather long and not terribly interesting, it does manage to keep things moving at a decent pace. this is a great video to play on a big screen in a dance club or venue, as it has a lot of good video ""atmosphere"". some of the really dark, black&white segments with monkeys are my favorites."
5,Love the shoe,"This is my second pair. They're light weight, breathe well, plenty of stability, plenty of room in th toe box. I like them better than the 4 pair of NB 765's I owned before them."
5,Saucony Grid Omni 5 Moderate Running Shoe,I purchased last years model as I've been very happy with this shoe over the years. The company took the order and payment and emailed be back due to a inventory mistake so they sent me the 2007 model. The Omni 5 does not disappoint. I used it first to run the Mt. Rainier to Pacific run with my team over 24 hrs back a few years ago. It is a good trainer and good for longer distance mileage. I prefer this to 2 other top line Asics shoes I've also run in over the last 15 yrs. It is good for my 50 yr old knees and back.
4,saucony running shoes,the shoes are a good fit for men with a narrow heel and need good support on the arch. great running shoes.
2,Product Was Never Delivered,"After many calls and emails with EastBay, they were not able to successfully deliver shoes to me after 4 weeks. I cancelled the order and made a local purchase. The shoes likely would have been fine - EastBay's ability to deliver the shoes to me was non-existent. This is the first time I have had any online purchase delivery issues with many purchases over the years from Amazon, Ebay and other online retailers. Quite disappointing."
4,Just When I Was About to Write Him Off...,"It looked like Gary Numan was floundering through the late 80's and early 90's, and I figured, well, he had a good career. Then came this album, which I was reluctant to buy. But finally everything comes together - his dark lyrics, the guitar work and menacing music. Maybe it's his wife. Recommended for fans of dark music."
2,not a good value,"the recipient said it was small and not well made, was going to return but it was a big hassle so she kept it anyway."
3,Dissatisfied,"Flopsie is stitched done his back. This looks very ""unnatural"" and i was disappointed to see it. We recently had one of our dogs spayed. When my grandson saw the stitching on Flopsie, he asked it he (Flopsie) had an operation too."
1,the coloring peels off!,"Yea, they're super-cute, but don't get the colored ones!We followed the directions that we hadn't noticed until we opened the box at home: hand wash only! If we'd seen that we surely would have gotten the clear versions of the same glasses. After about 5 or so hand washes the coloring starts to peel at the edges leaving clear glass showing.Don't get them! Waste of money to get the colored ones; get the clear ones instead!"
1,"Cheers glasses, Sooo disappointing!","I purchased both the Cheers Old Fashioned and the Hiball glasses, and have had them for less than one month. They have only been hand washed yet they are losing their color. I'm so disappointed, I had expected better of Mikasa."
1,no heart,"Unfortunately the production is too smooth and too less heartfelt. The originals of Kool & The Gang are WAY better. One would have wished that such great song material gives a great album with groove and fun, but in fact it's pretty boring....and the more I hear of Ashanti (Cherish), the more I get the impression that she can't sing...."
3,"Sorry, Disky, but this album title was already taken","""There's a Kind of Hush"" marked the end of the glory days, such as they were, for Herman's Hermits since this was their final Gold LP, their final Gold single, and their final Top Ten hit, ""Dandy."" The only thing is that this 2001 import from Disky is not the original 1967 album of this title. That one had ""East-West,"" ""No Milk Today"" and ""Saturday's Child,"" which was also recorded by the Monkees, who basically replaced Herman's Hermits in the pop music galaxy. ""Jezebel"" is the best of the songs that remain. So this one has to lose a star for being an example of bait and switch as far as I am concerned. Besides, you can pick up any one of a half-dozen Herman's Hermits hit collections and get the two best songs off of this ""album."""
3,"Its ok, but I got a bad tube.",Story:I bought this tube for testing in my JCM800 and my Valvestate VS65R.Good: Its a tube that fits perfectly in my VS65R.Bad: Honestly I got a bad tube. It doesn't fit in my JCM800 2203 so I put it in my VS65R just for shits and giggles. I removed my existing Russian made GrooveTube and a big difference... unfortunately not good. See below.Ugly: Slightly larger than JJs or GrooveTubes so didn't fit in my JCM800 2203 no big deal. Tube fits fine in my VS65R but dull and lifeless. My volume has decreased about 70% with this tube in place. I had a Russian GrooveTube and it was really clean great tone and LOUD.Overall: I was not satisfied with my Electro-Harmonix tube and probably wouldn't buy anymore. I more than likely got a bad tube but that is the luck of the draw.
4,Armchair travel,"A 47 minute tour of the Yucatan, Belize, and Guatamala, for anyone planning to travel there or just interested in the area. This video does not give alot of detail on any one destination, or much information on accomadations above the roughing it level. It does take the time to get in closer on some of the out of the way places, and is entertaining without being too heavy. Also, one of the few resources I have found that gives information on how Semmana Santa, the week before Easter and very big in Spain, is celebrated in this area so heavily influenced by Spanish customs."
1,Read it if you hate Islam already,"This book is for those who hate Islam already, and only want to strengthen their convictions. The source material for the ""research"" is extremist literature and other Islam-hating books.For those who wish to get true scholarly information on Islam from an unbiased source, I recommend ""Islam: an Introduction"" by Annemarie Schimmel. She spent more years at Harvard researching Islam and Muslims than many of us have lived."
1,Rubbish,"All the reviewers here keep talking about scholarship, and unbiased information etc.This book is far from any of these. It is shabby, inaccurate (and at many places incorrect) and gross misrepresentation.If you want to read real books about Islam by people who are truly objective, then read those by John Esposito. I do not agree with Dr Espositos conclusions myself sometimes, but I respect his opinions because they are well researched and objective."
1,Devil can cite scripture for his purpose - Shakespeare,"This book is a very devotional work, written with a zeal of missionary. It appears that this work of John Ankerberg is very subjective in order to appeal to the emotions of his ""audience"". If we try to judge the book based on the current scientific standards, this book falls short of that. Serious writers on a subject should not allow their sentiments and personal biases to creep into their writings, especially if they are writing about a faith which they themselves do not believe in. There is no place for such things as ""intellectual dishonesty"" in the scientific world. In addition, this book is filled with ""out of context"" information about Islam. It only reminds its readers what Shakespeare said in ""The Merchant of Venice"":""The devil can cite scripture for his purpose."""
1,Out of context.,"These writers are quoting out of context. Readers should beware. Allow me to give an example from the bible of how things can be manipulated to fit a certain agenda.Deuteronomy 13:13-1613. Certain men, the children of Belial, are gone out from among you, and have withdrawn the inhabitants of their city, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which ye have not known;14. Then shalt thou enquire, and make search, and ask diligently: and, behold, if it be truth, and the thing certain, that such abomination is wrought among you;15. Thou shalt surely smite the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword, destroying it utterly, and all that is therein, and the cattle thereof, with the edge of the sword.16. And thou shalt gather all the spoil of it into the midst of the street thereof, and shalt burn with fire the city, and all the spoil thereof every whit, for the Lord thy God: and it shall be an heap for ever; it shall not be built again."
1,Disney perfume set,I ahve used the Minnie perfume before and really liked it but these hardly have any scent at all! Would not recommend wasting money on this product
3,wondering why,"having listened to serendipity street, chantal sounds good but i am curious as to why she needs back up vocalists, other than that i may buy it in the future oldnavyjazz"
4,Great Production,"This shows Khayree's gifts to the fullest. It lays out some tracks with that hard gangsta sound, and then switches it up with some soulful beats. It's mix of Rap as well as R & B make it a great album to listen to. It's got some uplifting songs as well as those ghetto tracks that make you feel the rapper while nodding your head. A must in any rap fans collection."
3,Disturbing,"I'd like to start this review off by saying that ""Fitcher's Brides"" was extremely well written. Mr. Frost definitely has a way with words and the scripture passages included were on the dot. However, I found the story to be extremely morbid and disturbing. Even now I have a hard time pushing the gory descriptions from my mind. Having never read either ""Bluebeard"" or ""The Fitcher Bird"" I cannot say as to whether or not ""Fitcher's Brides"" is a good retelling. But, if you enjoy reading about the devil posing as a most holy reverend and preaching that he knows the date of Judgment Day and killing his wives for succumbing to Eve's curiosity and in the end good somewhat triumphing over evil..then this is the book for you."
1,ARRRG,I've been waiting for MONTHS and now they say it's cancelled? I wanted this game and now I'm not getting it... I cannot find enough outlet to vent my fury...
4,Murder Over New York,"My Dad first saw Charlie Chan movies when he was a little kid watching the late late movie(which was frequently a Chan movie). He remembers none of the movies, except this one. Just that says alot. ""Murder Over New York"" is a great movie, and a good mystery. That plane scene towards the end is one of the most suspenseful scenes ever made in a Chan picture. Number two son Jimmy is on hand as usual, and Sidney Toler does his usual excellent job as Chan. Also, Shemp Howard of Three Stooges fame makes a surprise appearance at one point. ""Murder Over New York"" may not be critically acclaimed, but it is viewer acclaimed."
5,GREAT JOB,Thak's you for the outstanding job in getting this tape to me. It's like new. I will enjoy it for manny yaers. ART
4,A Strong Supporting Cast,Sidney Toler plays Charlie and Sen Yung has the role of Jimmie Chan in this movie about the great detective solving a homicide which happened on board an airliner. It's another 20th Century-Fox film with Harry Lachman as director and a strong supporting cast.
4,great for christains and all those that 100% prolife,This is an encyclical that focuses especially on abotrion and euthanasia from a biblical perspective. i find it to be intereting.
3,too big,"The info sheet did not say how big this light was. The diameter is larger than any of the other indoor flood lights we have bought. As a result, they barely fit the recessed light cans and stick out a bit too."
1,"DIM! DON""T BUY!",These are the dimmest 65W bulbs imaginable. I feel conned! Plus they have wide neck and didn't fit my standard bulb sockets properly at all. I usually get GE bulbs and bought these without thinking about the brand - I would NEVER buy Feit bulbs again!
4,"Dated, but still a gold mine.","10-Point Rating: (8.75)One of the claims of the analytical school of western philosophy is that math is reducible to logic, specifically the logic of groups, classes, or sets. In this vein, I can think of no better introduction than Russell's Principles of Mathematics. Although many of the ideas he proposes are intellectually outdated, Russell's method is rigorous and his presentation is lucid. While this book is not for everyone, no serious student of mathematical foundations should be without it. The chapters on zero and the concept of continuity are especially insightful."
1,Horrible edition,"When an editor simply republish something out of copyright protection, the only thing he has to do is to copy the pages, all the pages. If he just do that the client will be happy. That editor was incapable of doing that simple thing. Some pages from Bertrand Russell's book are *missing*. This is simply infuriating and absolutely inexcusable. To add insult to injury, the font is so degraded as to make the reading difficult. A double rip-off."
4,Tha Principles of Mathematics and ForgottenBooks,"Dear reader,The Principles of Mathematics is a classic of the literature of mathematical logic that should be read by those who nurture an interest in mathematics. The Forgotten Books Collection is readable and accessible.Luiz Roberto RosaItatiba - SP - Brazil"
5,Insight,"Only when you love math can you appreciate Bertrand Russell's insights on math. He has a particular way of thinking and writing it down in a way that makes his ideas come to life. This book is slow reading and void of much symbolism. It is very retorical, but it is overrided by the exquisite syntax. For those students, professionals, and aficionados of Pure Mathematics this is the way to master the proofs and definitions in a whole new light, even though Bertrand's book go back to the beggining of the 20th Century, it is a world of wisdom that won't fail you if you have a true desire to better your understanding of Math in its most needed depth."
2,Bad copy of nice work,"This book is hard to read. I will not buy any book like this.It looks like speculation: so interesting work by Russell, and and so bad printing."
4,good album,"I have to say I enjoyed this album even though my main music preferance is Reggaeton, there's a couple of tracks on here that if you didn't know any better you swear dr. dre produced them, that's how good the production is on this disc, I never been a big fan of mexican rap but this album is real good and worth a listen even if you not a big fan of mexican rap. there's a lot more than just one hit on this cd that's for sure."
1,another one,"well its another vato loco rap group,,now with banda beats.well banda is mexican regional music whos roots come from europe.well only some songs in this cd has,well the hell the only banda sound is the tuba...so just call it rap with tuba...wheres the trumpet, clarinets, i guess if your a mexican and wanna impress the ladies with your car system well this is it.the only reason they're making noise is cause their label is univision( a spanish tv station).well univision doesn't really have good music"
3,Can't see it in the dark.,"Size, style, features, etc., all are fine EXCEPT I can't see it in the dark. It needs phosphorescent hands, which it does have. If I could see it, I'd give it 5-stars."
1,do not buy this clock,"The ""fully lit dial"" does not illuminate the hands. The hands are painted to look like they glow in the dark, but they do not. As a result you will not be able to read the time during the night unless you pick up the clock, get it close to your face, and press the ""light"" button several times, tilting the face back and forth to try to make out the time. You are now fully awake."
3,This is not a Timex clock,"I just bought this clock. The listing says Quartz Analog Clock by Timex, but it is not by Timex. The clock face says ""Advance"" and the manufacturer is some small company you never heard of. I'm going to keep the clock --- it seems to work, it has the features I want --- but it has a cheap feel to it that I would not expect from a Timex clock."
3,Good (not great) for the Price,"This is a nice clock. The problem is that the hands are not lighted, so it isn't great for a bedside choice. It is quiet, and works well enough."
1,CD not working,"The CD attached to this book is not working. Actually, I can not open the e-book because it is encrypted with a strange key. I tried everything, searched the internet for solution and advice but nothing. I am not happy."
5,"Good item, fast delivery","It is as good as a brand new one! I ordered it on Monday afternoon, and it arrived at my apartment at 10:00 AM on Wednesday. Fast shipping!"
2,You need to look up the definition of eponymous before you use it.,"Eponymous doesn't describe this album, the band, the title, anything related to this album. Why the other reviewer decided to use that word, twice for that matter, is beyond logic. In any case though, this album sucks. It sounds like radio pop, this band completely sold out. And the lead singer, while he might be a pompous, egotistical maniac, is no where close to Lennon or Bono. Give me a break. Either the previous reviewer couldn't be honest with the audience, or he doens't know what he's talking about. If you want a rock album, stay away from this one."
5,Mucho Corazon,"Disco bellissimo,registrato davvero in modo spettacolare,esalterÃ  il vostro impianto,la voce di Martirio Ã¨ o meglio non Ã¨ assimilabile a quella di un essere umano,nÃ¨ maschio nÃ¨ femmina,Ã¨ una bellissima fusione di entrambe le parti,quasi un angelo.Da ascoltare e riascoltare piÃ¹ e piÃ¹ volte,Ã¨ una esperienza da vivere."
3,Steven Jackson Ram Jersey,"The Jersey is ok for the price. There is no stitching on the jersey, all the numbers are ironed on. Will see how it holds up in the Laundry?"
5,Just right.,"As a Docent at the Skirball Museum I find this book most imformative. It enables one to accurately tell the stories of our people and their life in the USA. One item which is missing is the story of the first Jew to come to the Colonies, Jaochim Gans of Prague, sent to assay the colony of Virginia in 1585. The first Jew to come to what is now the USA. Almost 80 years before the Sephardim from Brazil! ( American Jewish History - Jewish Historical Society June 1998."
4,almost perfect,"A fun and motivational book with great advice. Mark Jenkins' personal story is inspiring and the text is easy to read and understand. However, there is a glaring error in the section on how to calcualte your percent body fat.First, the equation for women doesn't work because of a typo - multiply your body weight by 0.732, NOT .0732 as the text says. Second, the resulting number is your lean body mass and not your percent body fat, as the example in the book states. There is no additional info on how to use lean muscle mass number to calculate your percent body fat. This is just lousy fact checking - the rest of the book is great and as long as you move the decimal point, you'll get a usable number.You can also use this easy online calculator, just plug in your measurements:http://www.am-i-fat.com/body_fat_percentage.htmlGood luck!"
3,Great how-to book!,"This book is great if you're looking for beneficial exercises you can do in the comfort of your home with minimal equipment. I had never used an exercise ball , so I was pleasantly surprised with the fun and intensity this added to my workouts. I have yet to see what the program does long term, but I have to say overall the book is excellent for exercise instruction and even motivational purposes. The only beef I have is that the nutritional segment is really not even a blip on the radar. I guess I was hoping for more in-depth information than just youarewhatyoueat and one sample menu . Other than that, I'm glad I bought the book!"
2,Disappointed with life of lamp,"I have had the Panasonic PT40LC12 40"" 16:9 Widescreen Projection LCD Display for 26 months now. I am currently waiting on Circuit City to replace the 2nd lamp in the unit. After the first lamp one went out within 12 months, I bought another extended warranty after the original 24 month warranty had expired. It wasn't a month later that the 2nd lamp has now gone out.It looks as though they are going to require replacing every year, which will be very expensive to maintain. Even though the unit has a great picture, I have found the maintenance problems to not be worth the purchase. Also, it has taken Circuit City over 1 week since first calling them and I still haven't got the unit repaired.I would not buy one of these again and especially from Circuit City."
1,Costs too much to fix and you have to fix it often.,"Replaced lamps multiple times. They die often if you have any hours on the TV. A few months after the last bulb replacement, something went completely wrong and won't turn on. The power LED just blinks which isn't even a code in the manual. Will never buy another Panasonic TV."
5,LOVE THIS tv,"I had previously owned an RCA F38310 HDTV which was nothing but trouble. I have had this set for almost 6 months now - bought it sight unseen from circuit city and have been thrilled with it. Works great with digital cable, DVD, PSX2 and terrestial HD signals(need an HD reciever) and High Def DirecTv - standard DirecTv was not so great (looked washed out) but I am dropping my subscription - I only used it for High def channels and I just got HD Cable which is fantastic (Discovery HD Theatre is awsome)!the minor con -Speakers are not great but I'll bet if you are looking at this TV you already have or will get a quality surround sound system.The bottom line with this set is the picture, this set is on par with entry level Plasma sets and well exceeds any standard rear projection tvs.Absolutely no problems so far but if I have learned anything from my RCA HDTV purchase,always get a good warranty with in home service."
4,gift,This was purchased as a gift for my mother who requested it. I'm assuming she liked as she asked for more in the series. Not sure what more to say.
5,Very Good,The House of Winslow series is one of the best out . The Gentle Rebel is about a young man named Nathan and his fight for freedom. It is also about a young girl named Julie who has more then a few problems of her own. They are brought together by God. In this book they both learn to love and trust him with their hearts. I loved this book and cant wait to read the next one in the series.
1,Died after 3 months!,"I received this for Christmas and at first it was great except that I would accidentally turn it off everytime I was drying my hair because of the placement of the on/off switch.Last week, it started smelling like something was burning and I cleaned the filter. Today the motor would hardly turn on and it was trashed.It is also heavy and my arms/hands would tire before my hair was dry."
3,sound didn't line up with his mouth!,"I don't know if its just ""my"" DVD of this concert but Mr. Ball's words did not line up with his mouth, for most every song during the video! This became very distracting and made the entire experience not worthwhile. His singing was top notch however. His stage presence was not that professional during many of the songs. He seemed ""forced"". His awkward attempts at dancing were not memorable. He should stick to singing the powerful ballads...and if the words lined up with his mouth, I would have rated this DVD a 5 star product."
2,Terrible Transfer,"I was glad to see that I was not the first to see this, the video and audio is way out of sync. Making a PAL format video into NTSC which is our format in the USA is very difficult. The software that HIPO people used was very crude at best. I have had better results at home. If I was not a huge fan of Mr. Ball I would return the product. My rating does not reflect the performance but the product that this company produced. As for the concert it is great and Mr. Ball is very good. I am a big fan of his, but this product will do nothing to enhance his image in the USA. IMHO this company should pull the product and refund customers."
5,DVD Audio,"To get the sounds to line up with his mouth, you have to go into the Audio options and choose the one that isn'st chosen, and then they should line up.It's like that on all of them."
2,Michael Ball's performance at Royal Albert Hall,I purchases the DVD because I had heard the last song in a WETA program some time ago. I had tuned in as the program ended. I was so impressed that I wanted to hear the entire program- hence my purchase from Amazon. Unfortunately the sound track was so poor that I had to continually adjust the volume. I suspect the problem was in the reproduction of the DVDs.Winford W. Barrow
5,Michael Ball at His BEST............,"Purchased this DVD and have to tell you, it was the BEST purchased I ever made....Being such a huge fan of Michael Ball and his talent, I was not disappointed at all... This DVD is entertaining from beginning to the end....some of my favorites include: Something so strong, Oh! what a circus, We have all the time in the world/Millennium, let the river run, Help yourself....Well worth the money I paid for it....If your a Michael Ball fan or if you simply want to hear someone with a great voice and lots of talent, this DVD is the one.........five stars all the way !!!!............."
5,Addictive viewing,"If you are (or are not) a Michael Ball fan, this video is an incredible example of his talents. It has it all. From the serious to the comic side, Michael displays a unique mixture. His vocal range is phenomenal. If you have either of his first videos, he has matured and improves each time I see him. His acting ability shines with each serious song. His appeal to the ladies is understandable. This video has songs selected to appeal to every type of viewer. The Blues Brothers medley is a ""fun to watch sequence."" His Gethsemene and Empty Chairs at Empty Tables are emotion wringers. I have viewed this video so many times I fear I shall have to buy a second one."
4,But where's the rest?,"Yes, it's a great recording, a great concert by a great singer (with a few silly song selections). He's got the warmest, richest voice of any male singer in his genre today. But I first purchased this on video a couple of years ago from the UK, which has a short documentary on the creation of the tour. I was disppointed to see that it was not included as a bonus feature with this release."
2,Disappointment,The DVD has the picture out of sync. with the audio. A real annoyance when the camera is close enough to see lips.
5,The gentlest of comedies,"If you want to find out about middle-class life in England, forget Notting Hill, Bridget Jones, Four Weddings and WATCH THIS! Perhaps more appealing to the over thirty crowd, it's comedy is, nonetheless, definitely universal. This series was made for British crowds and not constucted around ideas of what Americans think Britain is like and so gives a more accurate impression of English life. We don't all live in London or that non-specific natural area always referred to as ""the country."" We don't all drive around in Mini Coopers and we are capable of producing narratives not based on ""gritty Northern life"" (The Full Monty, Billy Elliot) ""hilarious upper-class rom-coms,"" or London based ganster films a la Lock, Stock... and Snatch. It's not dramatic or edgey, but it does have some skilled actors with well written and intelligent scripts. BUY IT, WATCH AND LOVE IT!"
5,Immensely enjoyable,This series just like previous series 1-4 is extremely enjoyable.I would reccomend this DVD to anyone who loves Brit-comedy.
3,"Great collection, bad Kindle version","This is a great collection, I know that since I have the dead tree version. However, I expected the Kindle version to have much higher resolution images. It's barely readable on an iPad."
2,hot air,"Nothing really informative. This book it seems is a collection of sighting data. The sightings are strung together in a neverending number of paragraphs. No information, only data.Check out Schnoebelen's book Space Invaders. Much more informative."
2,"Boring, poorly organized","I'm the kind of guy who just wants the facts, not a bunch of talking. I'd rather read first-hand sources than what this guy regurgitates.If you're looking for the most readable overview of UFOs, then get ""The UFO Book"" by Jerome Clark, or ""Above Top Secret"" by Timothy Good."
4,"A Encylopedic Compendium of ""Blue Book"" Failure","The best service that Dolan provides in his well researched volume (I) is that he identifies a pattern for how several agencies (governmental and contracted) insult our intelligence by sending out layers of information, disinformation, clarified and refurbished information and more disinformation. Dolan proves one thing for sure. The Government has succeeded in their plea of innocence by confusion on the matter until proven guilty.Dolan only claims to submit evidence in the case of long-standing cover-up. However, Dolan's compilation of case study after case study tells us why the jury is still out. You will not find a flying saucer on the White house lawn. You will not find X-file-like drama (for the most part). You will find a sober examination of facts in evidence, suggesting traces that many more volumes of information in extant cannot be accessed through the freedom of information act.Well, at least not for now, anyway!"
5,Exciting and Thought Provoking,"All the history you need to know about the UFO Phenomenon without any speculation or craziness. Factual and Objective, Eerily Realistic, An Eye Opening read which gives insight into the our everyday existence and provokes the question - Why?Basically all the great UFO sitings and the governments response(s) from 1941-1973. There's also a little bit on what else the military was up to, as it corresponds to how they keep their secrets, and from the evidence they keep many.Also Highly Reccomended is ""The High Strangeness: Densities, Dimensions and the Process of Alien Abduction"" and ""The Secret History of the World"". Available from [...]"
4,Clear as day,An exhaustive and detailed history based on verified testimony and released documents. Rock solid. A very conservative historical treatment which renders the ultimate conclusion as obvious.
3,"A good book, but a few too many rave reviews","Maybe it's because I got it on Kindle, or maybe it's because I haven't read many other UFO books, but while the book does a great job of showing the dichotomy between the public and behind-the-scenes treatment of UFOs by the Air Force / Intelligence agencies, I feel that the actual UFO reports are a bit too much of the anecdotal summary type, and not enough ""just the facts, Ma'am"".So, while the conclusion for cover-up and secrecy is pretty well argued, it's far less of a given that 'for sure we're being visited by extraterrestrials'.But a good book nonetheless. Don't let me dissuade you from purchasing it."
4,Get this one for MUSIQUE!,"My UK CD single includes the following tracks: 1. Da Funk (radio edit) 2. Da Funk (original version) and 3. Musique. I really like DP's album ""Homework,"" but it disappointed me that one of their best tracks, i.e., Musique, is not on it. Actually, you can hear it in the background to ""Wdpk 83.7 fm."" Check it out... it's an awesome dark and driving beat."
2,Shouldn't have let me know the real price,"This item cost $110, and as soon as it arrived, I knew I overpaid for it. If I'd gotten it at Walmart for $25, I would have said ""wow, what a deal!"" It's very basic, not particularly high quality, and it's wobbly. To add insult to injury, it shipped directly from Amazon.com's 3rd-party supplier, and an invoice was inadvertently (I hope) left in the box showing that Amazon only paid $50 for it. Then, without even repackaging it, without even seeing it, with no added value whatsoever, they charged me $110! Nice little 100% profit."
3,"Punch, kick, repeat....","Being a Yank, I'm fascinated by English football culture. We follow our teams over here, but the whole hoolie scene is nearly out of the realm of imagination here in the States. So, as a football supporter here, I try to learn as much as I can about the fans in England. That said, I was a little disappointed in Blades Business Crew. While it is a amazingly detailed account of years of clashes with opposing firms, it doesn't yield much insight into why a ""normal"" person would do this. Nor does Cowens reveal much about himself other than his love of Pringle and of being regarded as a top boy. Though you can't expect too much socialogical analysis from a guy who isn't in that business. If you want to read about the day in and day out scuffling of a firm, this is as good as any. If you are looking for an explanation, or simply an attempt to grasp why they do it, I'd suggest Buford's ""Among the Thugs"" or the book about John Barnes,""Out of His Skin""."
4,Great for hidden components,"We were putting components behind wooden doors so the RF to IR conversion worked great. It is an older model and did not have codes for newer components. The thought of using ""learning mode"" was scary at first but was trivial after doing it once. I was able to custimize labels on LCD screen to names meaniful for us and program keys in a way that worked best for us. If component is not known to the device and you do not have a remote for thr device you are out of luck. We were able to put RF receiver inside cabinet and have it bounce IR inside to all components without the need of individual emitters that are provided."
4,Easy to program,"It is so nice to just have one remote to control audio and video instead of having 4!!! The best part it was so easy to program. The only thing I would change about this remote is the ""select"" button. It should be on its own in the center. Instead it is in the center but the right,left, up and down arrows and very close together and if you have large fingers (as most men do) it is hard to press the ""select"" button without having to press one of the arrows. Other than that, we are very happy with this product."
5,A Great Product,"This remote truly is amazing. It was very simple to program and it was even easier to setup the RF receiver and blasters. In fact, the main receiver was so powerful that I didn't even need to setup the blasters for some devices that seemed like they would be out of the receiver's range. And, I still have leftover blasters. The only complaint I had was the price. It seems like a lot to pay almost $250 for a remote control. However, these kind of remotes are really only needed in home theatres which tend to run a lot more the $250 :) So, if you really have a need for a programmable universal remote control, $250 shouldn't be unreasonable for something that works as well as this."
5,There is no one else like Randy Stonehill!!,"~ classic Stonehill - great music, great lyrics & a heart pouring out that reaches out & grabs the attention of any who will listen. Thank you Randy! God bless!"
5,Traditional Greek Cookery,"A friend of mine had brought some of these recipes to work for us to try and we fell in love with the food so much we bought a copy for ourselves .They are all fabulous and tasty,you will not regret buying this book.The seller was spot on with the description of condition and posted swiftly.All round a great experience,unlike another popular ""selling site""."
1,Looks high quality but it's really bad...,"I know it is hard to think that there are real differences between the different kinds of 6ft coax cables, but this one is really, really bad. I replaced my ""made in the back of the truck"" cable left by the installer with this one, turned on the TV and... what the heck, the picture quality is really bad - much worse than the installer-provided thing. Analyzing it further, this cable does not have a solid copper core, just two strands of hair-thin stranded copper wire. Unlike your regular RG6, this cable is really maleable and bends way too easy for a cable that should carry lots of insulation. Get something else."
1,Deceptive Product,"The PXT1102 Coaxial Cable is a great looking cable for build quality but falls very short on performance.I have a Sony KDL52Z5100 LCD which is a very high end tv it includes an excellent internal tuner, the reason i mention this is because i do not use a cable box therefor i utilize the tv to decode my cable tv. All i have in line with my tv is surge protector/battery backup unit the rest is direct to cable provider. Well i introduced the PXT1102 into the system and my HD channels were no longer detected, Picture quality went down, pretty much a failure. Simply put the cable does not have the bandwidth to support hd tv. Do not buy this outdated cable if you intend to pass Digital channels through it, it will not function. Use an RG 6 quad shield cable for your tv not this cable."
5,Great Book,This is a really neat book. As an adult I enjoyed it and as a future educator I cannot wait to teach this book.
3,So-so,"This album was quite a disappointment for me to be frank. There are several good tracks on this album like ""Jibaro en Nueva York"" which is a humorous tale of a jibaro that goes to NY only to forget or deny his roots. ""Abanacue"" is a sold track along with ""Sigo Pensando En Ti"" but the album lacks a truly ""great"" song like ""Boranda"" or ""Fuego en el 23"". There's a tribute to Tonito Ledee that is very heartfelt. Other than this I wouldn't bother buying this one really. They have done better."
4,THANK YOU KITCHENAID!!!!!,"This skillet is well worth the price. Like most other people I do not care for the rivets in the skillet, but it cost a lot less and works just as well as other brands!"
1,Paintball without the paint?????,"I bought these thinking they would be great for my son's new airsoft guns. My son and I tried these in all three spring operated airsoft guns we have. NONE of the paintballs would break, infact they were so soft and rubber like that the paintballs often jamed when even loading one at a time. The airsoft guns we have range from 230fps to 265fps. I also have one that is 310fps, which is above the limit on the bottle (says not to use at more than 285fps). I fired them from all distances at a brick wall, even at point blank range these pieces of junk didn't break, they bounced. All I can say is if you want paintballs these are NOT the ones to buy. I wasted $60 on 6mm paintballs that don't break and I can't even use as ammo just to get rid of them because they don't load. Don't buy these...."
4,Jreed,They work just fine. I used them with a gun with 260 fps and they worked but at close range. I used with another gun with a little over 300 fps and they worked fine. It was hard to see the dark color on dark materials (as expected) but no issues.
5,A Great New Read!,"This new edition (published in 2009) of Paul Dickson's classic baseball dictonary is 4.2 pounds of pure joy. Paul worked for more than a decade to track down every baseball term in existence -- and the origin thereof -- and he has put together a book that is both a solid reference book and a wonderful read. Dickson's Baseball Dictionary will be within reaching distance when the Orioles' season starts, and I intend to delve into it whenever the game lags -- and probably during bases-loaded situations as well. The first two editions were superb in their own right; the third edition takes baseball scholarship to a new and exciting level.Joseph C. GouldenWashington, DC"
1,Kindle edition review: unusable,"Unfortunately, this wonderful book is virtually unusable on the Kindle. There is no useful table of contents, and neither is there an index of any sort. Buy the paper copy instead."
3,not velour :(,"the one I was shipped was not velour. It's more like the fabric used in crafts, I wish I could describe it in a better way but that's what it reminded me of, tough and just blah. I didn't return it because it would be such a hassle and i figures it would get the job done-- its big enough and red with no writing on it."
1,Looks nice but...,I was very happy with the way that the bag looked when I removed it from the package. Unfortunately the entire bottom seam ripped and packages fell out onto the ground before Santa was even able to get in the door! Terribly disappointed with this product.
1,Bad,Bag looked awesome from the start. Looked okay when I took it out. Was big enough for what I bought it for but as soon as I put two things in it the bottom of the bag seam started to tear. It is hardly put together at all. :( Just seamed it up myself.
1,Can't hold much,We used this for toys and when we started putting toys in each bag the entire bottom of the bag fell apart. Maybe it could be used for clothes or something that didn't have boxes?
5,"Rubie, you rock!","I was quite pleased with the quality of the cloth and size of the bag. It arrived in time to be useful for our Holiday Concert presentation. The only concern I may have is cleaning. We have not done that so I am not sure how the bag will hold up to a dry cleaning process. Until then, I would recommend to any group if you are going to have a Santa each year, invest in owning your own suit rather than renting."
1,Weak stitching,The bottom of the bag ripped open the first time I used it. Stitching must be very weak and it was useless.
4,Good book,This was well organized and provided some additional insight into the concept of intuition.
3,Interesting to some.,I really didnt get anything out of this book.It was an interesting read.Some people will benefit like the majority of the other reviewers but there are a few who dont.
1,Very Impractical,"Laura teaches people to hallucinate and pretend that the hallucinations have meaning. It really hasn't done much for Demi's career. Pretending your hallucinations have meaning could lead to delusions, psychosis, or worse. Laura gives no advice about what to do when the hallucinations become overwhelming or interrupt your daily routine. Better read the ""Stormy Search for the Self"", ""Spiritual Emergency"" by Stan and Christina Grof or ""A Path With Heart"" by Jack Kornfield for information about the potential negative side effects to Laura's teachings."
3,A bit disappointed,"I bought this book a couple of years ago. Since I am already very intuitive, I thought it would be interesting. I tried my best to do the exercises she asks for reader to do, but the people in the book had far more colorful images and analysis of their thoughts than I did! The exercise were hard for me to do - how do you know whether you are picking up clues for yourself or for someone that you know? Or even images from TV or movies that you've seen? I felt frustrated that I did not understand what was expected of me in the exercises and could not relate the disjointed images that I received to anything relevant in my life."
3,Not a How To,"This is not a how to book, for that I'd recommed other books such asHow To Do Psychic Readings Through Touch,Psychic Protection: Beginnings (Beginnings (Jackson, Tenn.).),Psychic Power: Young Person's School of Magic and Mystery (Young Person's School of Magic and Mystery, Vol. 2)and others.This book is more for the beginners beginner and just knowing/understanding what intuition is."
3,Short guide for a short game,"The guide is small and covers the main story of this game well though it did leave me feeling a bit to be diesired in depth (but so did the game itself). Decent pictures and writing, its just very short."
2,Temple of Broken Dialog Options,"Don't get me wrong - I loved Troika, and I play lots of D&D; games, so I'm pretty surprised to be giving such a low rating. The game is very ambitious, but the flexibility of choice isn't matched by the programming of the game.The two most glaring problems are the dialog options and the turn-based combat. The dialog options don't follow a set structure (that is, the ""exit dialog"" conversation might be any one of the options; typically it would be the last). As for the combat, there is no way to see melee or ranged dice rolls, so it is difficult to tell what is happening in combat.Even the most hardcore D&D;/Gary Gygax fan will find this a bit slow moving and boring, except when he is forced to reload over and over."
5,Bursting With Energy,"These guys worked hard! They were an extremely impressive live act. Heck, they put so much energy into things that the silly lip-synch videos they cut (all included here) are reasonably entertaining.The live footage is extremely compelling. I can't imagine anyone who has at least a casual interest in The Jam not enjoying this. Paul Weller cut an extremely impressive figure during the group's prime years and the band sprayed as much energy across a stage as anyone ever has. Of all the segments here, the most incredible is the Swedish TV appearance. It consists of a tight ""Absolute Beginners"", a tight ""Tales from the Riverbank"" (including horns), a brief interview with a snotty Paul Weller, and then an astounding ""Funeral Pyre"" which has to be one of the more intense performances ever given."
5,GOTTA LOVE IT,IF YOU LIKE THE JAM THAN THIS DVD IS GREAT THERE WAS SO MANY VIDEOS IVE NEVER SEEN GREAT BUY
4,Petroglyphs,I have been very interested in petroglyphs since the early 1980's and this book contained information that I had not found in my current collection. Lovely drawings and commentary.
2,Not well written,"I don't wish to offend the authors of this book, who I am sure are experts in this field. However, I found this book to be unnecessarily difficult to read.The the book presents inherently complex material, which testifies to the proficiency of the authors. However, it was often not clear what point the authors were trying to make, especially regarding graphs which lacked clear explanations. Often I had to to re-read an entry several times before I understood what the authors were trying to express.I am sure the book contains a wealth of valuable information (which is why I ordered it), but I personally was unwilling to invest the time and energy necessary to fathom the authors intent.I am a systems engineer for an international telecom company."
1,Had to return it,The coolant passages from the plastic intake to the aluminum piece did not line up. The coolant flow would have been severely restricted. Had to return it.
4,Works but not a perfect match,It fit pretty well but when my husband was putting it on we made a discovery its not a perfect match although it was supposed to be. Now I don't know if this is a flaw in this or just by it being an after market part. He was able to get it on and stays well but the last couple holes were a struggle to screw in properly and it makes it more difficult when you are putting in spark plugs and the coil packs if you have those on your vehicle.
3,"A Fun, Quick Read","I remember reading this from my mom's bookshelves a long time ago, and when I saw it at the library, I picked it up for a fun, quick read. Written in the early 80s, it's fun to see how different (and how much the same) life is/was for mothers. Some of it is universal, and other sections are very much 30 years ago. But the parts that she writes on parenting (and being married) are so funny, I found myself laughing out loud at parts, and getting misty at others. Recommended."
5,Still funny several decades later...,"Erma Bombeck was, hands down, the funniest humorist of her time. Even today, her work is still some of the best ever written.This book is a combination of a collection of her column writings, mixed in with some new (at the time) observings. Her reflection of husbands, kids, friends, and her own sanity (or lack thereof) will have you rolling on the floor with laughter (or, at least, giggling fairly loudly).A great book to add to your collection."
3,"If life is a bowl of cherries, this must be the pits",Lovely to catch up with one of Erma Bombeck's books. Loved her when I lived in America and it is sad she had to check out so early. She always brings a smile to my face and the afternoon flies by when I have my nose in one of her books.
3,Dated but still good,"I thought that the book was a little behind in the times and not incredibly comparable to modern life, even though she does concentrate on issues that have plagued families forever. It's tamer and more subdued than a lot of the humor today which made it both endearing and slightly boring. I would recommend Dave Barry or Robert Fulghum who are more current to anyone who enjoyed this book."
5,Outstanding!!!,"I'm a huge fan of the traditional ""tortured, melancholoy, dark & brooding"" Jann Arden but this is equally as wonderful as her old stuff. Of course, she could sing the phone book and I would love that too! She has one of those voices that truly touches you down deep in the soul.This album has a lot of great interpretations of some classic tunes...and Jann does a great job of breaking through the traditional format to put her own thoughts and feelings behind the words and lyrics we already know by heart.Kudos to you Jann! Nice job!! May the thoughts and prayers of your fans heal your heart as you have healed ours time and time again with your voice. I will keep you in my prayers, always."
5,Old School Salsa!,"This 1978 release by Roberto Roena was way ahead of its time and still sound fresh and exciting. This CD feature the great Juan Antonio ""Papo"" Pepin on conga drums and Roberto on the Bongo drum. Percussionist who are not aware of these two great players should listen up. If you want to hear some great arrangements and sophisticated percussion riffs, this is the CD for you."
3,Should have more practice pages,"I bought this for my 4 year-old daughter. The school she will be attending teaches this style of writing and I want her to be prepared. I feel that for the price of this workbook there needs to be more space for the children to practice. I have had to make copies of all the pages so she actually has enough space to write her letters more that a handful of times. For the money spent, they should give more room to actually write. It is a pretty skimpy book. There are only 28 pages. A better book to buy is called Modern Manuscript by Suzanne Lowe Wilke and Renee Cummings. It is not EXACTLY the same as D'Nealian, but close enough and there is WAY more room for practice!"
2,"Another nice idea, but still not well implemented.","I bought this book for my 5 year-old, who is in Kindergarten and working every day to practice her letters. The structure of the book is fine, but the overall size of the letters is much too large. Children at this stage are by now writing with pencils, and the size of these letters forces them back to crayons. This might work for younger children who are unused to pencils, but I honestly don't think a 3 year old needs to worry about forming D'Nealian letters properly. Had the letters been smaller this would have been fine. I felt the same way about Book 1 in this series as well."
2,Like wading through molases!,"I just could not wade through all the initial detail. I'm usually a patient reader, and I've enjoyed other works by Drury, but I couldn't get through chapter 1."
2,way over priced,"these lights have made a good name, but now are way over priced and they are not really built that well, I have five of them and three are broken within,, they are worth about $2.95 and not a penny more.."
2,good product!,"i needed a super bright led mag,its a good price if you need a basic led.quality product,thankx...the star box is broken on my side. 3STARS!!!!!"
3,ok,"I ordered 8 of these flashlights, which amazon listed as in stock, way before christmas. This seller was only able to ship one to me before christmas, i had to give a lot of people late christmas gifts because of this. DON'T LIST ITEMS THAT ARE NOT IN STOCK!!!!"
4,Great Light,I needed a light with a strong beam and this one is great.It is well made and should last a long time.
5,Best flashight on the market in my opinion,I have owned many maglites over the years and they are still the best quality flashlights available and are still made in the US. Pay up and get the best and you won't be tossing it away in a few years like other flashlights. The technology and design results in a very bright beam and the durability is unmatched. The only reason I ever have to purchase new ones is due to losing or misplacing them or leaving batteries in way too long resulting in leakage damage.
5,WOW!,"Not only is it the best LED Flashlight that I'ver ever owned, it IS the best flashlight I've ever owned!"
5,"Great Product, especially for the price",I bought this product to use at my work and its just great. Very durable and bright. I own other MagLites with the tradition kypton bulbs (Which work decent for general purposes)but this LED one takes the gold. Good on battery life and doesnt dim much when batteries are low. Overall I love this product and the price of $25 is a steal. I recommend this flashlight to anyone.
5,WOW,"I have had Mag-Lite in my home for many years for the fact that there is no better product on the market. I purchased this new model as an upgrade. While the old model gave good light and good service, there was one weak point, the light bulb. The bulb seemed to fail at the worst possible moment. With new LED technology, I expect to rarely if ever to have this problem again."
5,A light in the Dark,"My parents like the house dark, or rather they like saving money on electricity. My room has black walls & ceiling... In the middle of the night this is my best friend. I can find stuff from behind the bed, around the house, etch... It's also powerful. I've used it while fishing & it lights up a ""beam"" in the sky. It's a little to strong for night crawler hunting though. For this I usually put some tape over the light to decrease the output some."
3,Decent flashlight for price,"When compared to the price of other products such as Surefire, Streamlight etc. is stands well. The LED gives a decent beam (a nice white one). The bpdy is pretty sturdy and seems to be able to withstand some physical abuse. One of the major problems I seem to be having is the dark circle at the center when your adjust the head to give a wider beam. Doing so gives a big enough (and irritating) black hole at the middle of the light. When the head is turned so that the light is more focused, it disappears. I noticed another reviewer stated this so I guess this is an abnormality. I can't say about other brands with this feature because I have never used another brand; however, I'm just informing you potential buyers of something I see as a flaw in the design.I can't say about operating hours as I just got the product. I will when I am fully able to test the total operation time on standard D cell batteries."
5,WOW!! Seriously bright!!,"I can't get over the progress that LED flashlights have made in the last few years. They started out as dim and diffuse, and THIS is GREAT! The maglite is as bright or brighter than the conventional bulb, and is just as able to produce a very concentrated spot-beam. It is probably capable of 1/8 mile or farther! I'm very impressed."
5,So far so good. Feels sturdy and shines bright.,I keep this flashlight ready for action. It shines very bright and it is well constructed. The beam is very powerful.
2,It does not look Gray,"Very bummed out on this purchase. My husband wanted a LED maglite for xmas. It looks nothing like the photo. The flashlight looks purple. It functions great with a bright light, but he keeps making fun of me that i bought him a ""purple"" flashlight. Dont choose this color."
5,Im blind,These flashlights were purchased as emergency lights for my home. Put one in every closet on ea floor. These lights loaded with Duracell 10 yr shelf life batteriesoutperform my hundred dollar Stinger by a wide margin. They are cost effective and extremely bright. Very pleased. Highly recomend.
2,Works great until you drop it by mistake!,"I agree that these flashlights work great for what they are, however, I have already blown 2 LED modules by dropping the flashlights by accident, once myself, and once by my 2 year old. The LEDs pop out of their housing rendering them uselsss. At that point all you can do is pull out the spare filiment bulb provided with the flashlight and use it. The replacement LED's run almost 25 dollars. Not a good deal if you ask me. Buyer beware......"
4,Nice flashllight,"Nice and bright light. Had an incandescent bulb two D cell flashlight, but found it somewhat dim during an actual power outage and wanted something brighter and with longer battery life. I have a Mag-Lite AA LED flashlight (recommended, have since bought a second one) and decided to get a 2 D-cell LED Mag-Lite. The flashlight is bright with an adjustable beam, battery life is good, and the switch is either toggle (on/off) or momentary (on while pressed). Recommend this flashlight, the fact that is is made in the USA is a bonus to a good product."
1,Never buying a Mag -Lite again,"I had four mag lites. Two large, two mini. They all did the same thing. The tolerances are so fine, that WHEN the battery swells just a little, you cannot get the battery out. Unless you send it to Mag Light and pay them $25.00 plus shipping to get the batteries out, you can toss the light in the garbage. NOTHING will get the batteries out, NOTHING. I was using top line batteries. Ridiculous design, batteries always swell over time due to the chemical reaction. Get one, and sometime down the road, it will do the same thing. Battery warranties cover leakage, not MINOR swelling, so that won't help.You are warned.My opinion, waste of money. Fancy, good looking, and well made junk, due to the battery tube tolerances. Nice to look at, feels good, worthless after a year or so."
5,I own 5 of these...,"For $23 you won't make a mistake. I own 5 of these flashlights and I have had them for a few years and have not changed my battery since I bought them. I use them regularly to walk down the banks of the pond I fish at, it is very reliable and it gets the job done."
5,LOVE it,"I've absolutely loved this thing in the couple years I've owned it. Its size and weight make it a great bedside flashlight as it can double as a weapon (in the event you wake up to an uninvited person in your home).Have only run the LED bulb in it so far but love it. Creates a very bright beam which reaches out to quite some distance. Taken it camping a few times and was glad to have it along.Overall an amazing investment. Odd to say that about a flashlight... but I truly do love this thing. It sits by me while I sleep, rides with me while I'm traveling through the mountains at night, and has trekked countless miles in my hiking/camping pack.If you're after a large, 3-D cell flashlight then buy this."
3,Solid flashlight,"This flashlight works as expected. The construction appears sturdy. The 2-D Cell batteries will last a longer time, so I primarily use this as a backup flashlight. Regarding the light intensity, I've been more impressed with the Dorcey light, which is brighter for a similar (slightly lower) price point."
3,Just ok,"As usual, a well built flashlight from Maglite. The problem with this one is battery life, which is rated for around 9.5 hrs. Much happier with the 3-D cell Maglite LED which is of the same excellent quality but has much longer battery life (around 72 hrs)."
2,Merry christmas,"This was a christmas present for my friend, it was exactly what he needed. I wish I had the LED but it's not."
4,High Quality Product.,"Very nice product, very high quality, the only thing why I don't give it 5 star is because it is a bit bulky and heavy but other than that it is very nice flashlight."
5,this 3D maglite lives up to it's professional reputation,for those who need a well balanced midsized flashlight that's not too small and light or too big and heavy this 3D maglite fits the bill nicely. and with a focus head easily that goes from spot towide angle is nice to have along with high quality steel and superb durabilty all from a highly reputable flashlight manufacture maglite all at a affordable price makes this product a greatbang for the buck that could well last a lifetime since it also comes with a led that'll last at least 50000 hours. this is a flashlight that you can't go wrong with.
5,High Quality Flashlight,"When you buy a Mag-Lite you get a high quality flashlight and a heavy duty weapon. Just kidding about the weapon part, but if you did need something heavy in your home to hit an intruder with this, I'm sure this would cause substantial damage. Anyways, the LED light last forever so you'll always have a reliable flashlight around."
5,Always wanted one,"As a dude, I've always wanted one of these heavy duty flashlights. I was not disappointed. I accidentally dropped it right off the bat and I think it hurt the floor. Very sturdy and the light is unbelievable. All I had on hand were some no-name dollar store batteries and it's still unbelievably bright. I didn't know you can adjust the beam by twisting the top near the bulb. Great flashlight."
5,LED technology is great!,This is a great product from a great company. Unit is very bright and well made. I am sure that it will give me years of service.
5,Heavy Duty!,"This is one, durable, heavy duty flashlight - expect it to last a good long while! VERY bright, and the best part is, its heavy enough to use as a weapon if you need to. Great flashlight."
3,Black dead spot,Use it to walk the dog. It's bright but big black spot in the wide setting. Beam is not useful for my purpose. It must be a optics thing. I'd rather have no black spot and no beam. Also it is very cold in cold days as no plastic cover.Wouldn't buy it if I read reviews more carefully.
4,A very good flashlight...made even better...very bright LED,"I don't know how they make an LED flashlight (single LED) so bright, and with a beam that can reach out and touch someone...but Maglight did it. The focus-able beam pattern is great and throws a sharp, white-light light beam way out there.My other LED flashlights I have from Harbor Fright....they last a good while for batt time...but you can't see anything at night farther than 6 feet away...not true with this LED Maglight....huge improvement.The prior reviews of this maglight spoke of a spare light bulb in the battery end cap,,,but not one in the 2 I purchased....and I hear they are $6 each.FYI..happy flashlighter here in TX"
5,Love This Flashlight!,"I bought this and another Maglite after getting frustrated by all the junk flashlights we have lying around the house. Well these flashlights got a workout when Hurricane Irene came through here and left us without power for 51 hours. This Maglite is extremely bright and if you stand it on end it will light up a small room, you could actually see to do tasks without having to hold onto it. Pay attention to the size dimensions, I did not and was surprised at how long it was, much longer than the junk flashlights I usually buy. Extremely happy with this product."
5,Mag Lite,This is not my first mag lite. They are always top of the line. The price just made it most attractive.
4,Works great. Sturdy and great quality.,I've always loved the mag light brand. After they converted it to LED I had to have one. The light output isn't that spectacular however it gets the job done and it's sturdy and high quality. Highly recommend and it's a must have around the house.
2,MAGLITE ST 3DO16 (Update),"Very poor grounding system; does not work ""first time, every time"", requires some adjustments to get light to come on and then it may go off while in use. Not the reliable old Maglite; don't bet your life on this one. By former law enforcement officer.March 31, 2010 - After some adjustments and some ""Wearing in"" I love the light ! I now believe it's even better than the older bulb models, and yes, I am now ""betting my life"" on it when things go boom."
5,Very bright light,The first 3D led maglite that I bought it. Very bright light and long distance I like it.And bought it the new 3D more and also 2D led too.
5,Excellent Product!,This was a gift for my father and he absolutely loves it! It is bright and the batteries seem to hold up quite well. He has no complaints about it and says that it works better than his non-LED Mag-Lite. We have purchased several more since this original purchase.
4,"Good, but...",Flashlight is very good for the price. And perhaps I shouldn't be complaining about this based on that. But I wish the batteries didn't rattle around inside.That would be the only improvement I would suggest.
2,"big, heavy, drains batteries","I have the newer LED version as well as the classic incandescent version of this light. I leave the incandescent light standing with the tail cap off, because even though I rarely used the light, I would often find the batteries drained when I needed to use it. I had so far not had that problem with the LED light, until last night. No other light I have ever owned drains batteries like a Mag-Lite. We probably have 6 others in service right now around the house, and only the two Mag-Lite lights give us problems. If you want a big heavy club for hitting people with, great. But if you want to see them in the dark I hope you have a backup light from a different brand on you. Sorry, never again. I'm moving over to the smaller, brighter, and better Fenix lights."
1,poor quality,"What a piece of junk. I gave this product as a gift to my father-in-law. He used it regularly while checking his cattle. He started having problems with the switch that required him to hold the switch a certain way if we wanted it to work. Then the switch failed completely. When I contacted Maglite, they gave me the mailing address to the facility, and while I wasn't pleased to pay the $8 shipping, I did it anyway. Well, several days later I received an empty container back from the postal service indicating that one of their facilities had received an open and empty package.I'm finished with Maglite and will have to think twice about using the USPS for packages."
3,"Good construction, so so LED, so so light quality","Got this at Costco as a combo pack together with the 2-AA one.Pros: Very good construction quality, typical of a Mag Lite.Cons: I wish they have used a better LED like Cree or Luxeon. Even though rated at 3w, the light output is rather on the weak side. My 3-AAA 3w Dorcy oushone it, and the 120-lumens, 6w, 6-AAA beat it to a pulp. At the narrowest spot setting, the beam is almost as bright as the 3w Dorcy, but illuminated a much smaller area. Flooded it to a wider area to match the Dorcy's, its brightness became quite lower than the 3w Dorcy."
2,Always loved mag in the past,"I always liked mag in the past but with their LED mag I had issues . After one month of use the flashlight kept flickering . It was never dropped and always kept in a dry safe place . So I returned it and got another . The same issue it started to flicker on and off after a month of use . Other name brand led lights I own work great. The older none LED mag I own works great but the lights not as strong as the LED mag when it worked. I wanted this flashlight to work, the first month of use was wonderful and BRIGHT. But at $25 I expect years of use not a month."
4,Gray... with a purple hue,The one I received is gray with a purplish hue. It has nothing to do with functionality but it was unexpected.
2,"Good build, but not bright, beam lacking focus","Picked up one of these Maglite LED 2D Cell lights on Black Friday. Trying it out, I'm disappointed. The beam isn't as bright as a normal 2D flashlight. At around 15 feet, there's a large dead spot at the center of the light. Adjusting the focus didn't change this. Back this goes to the store, as other brands such as Surefire, Fenix, and Streamlight do better."
5,Nice product !,The 3 D batteries make it heavy but I like it that way. Very good light up to great distances. Highly recommended !
4,better then old,"this one is better then the older one that can be converted to an led , the light is crisp and brighter"
2,Ordered the 2-D cell and they sent me the 3-D cell,"Flashlight works fine, however it is not what I ordered. I wanted the 2D cell LED and they sent me the 3-D cell unit - it was also the wrong color."
5,Adult brine shrimp net.,"This product is really designed for adult brine shrimp, not newly hatched brine shrimp. Other than that, an excellent product, which I would recommend to anyone."
4,A Weird Listen for Ministry fans,"I first got into Ministry around the ""Psalm:69"" album. So I was more used to the Industrial-thrash metal Ministry. Couple of years ago I saw the ""Twitch"" album at a cd store and picked it up. I was quite confused, but eventually I really liked it. So I've been curious about this record for a while and eventually got the mp3 album.It was better than I expected. It has this new wave sound to it, but the songs are actually really well written and hearing Al Jorganson sing love songs with a fake british accent is awesome. Al's clean singing voice is really good, the songs are put together well, and the whole cd is good. There is one or two cringers in here but all and all it's a good cd. if you like ""Twitch"" or even ""The Land of Rape and Honey"" you might enjoy this.It's interesting even though this cd doesn't sound anything like later Ministry, you can hear parts of what Ministry would become in it's embryonic state."
2,A must-have for Ministry completists--Otherwise avoid!,"I'm amazed by the reviews that suggest this is Ministry's strongest album and that it's all been downhill from here. Al Jourgensen, the brains behind the group, was forced against his wishes to turn out this syrupy goop, when he was ready to get started with music like that on the seminal _Twitch_ album.This isn't such a bad album, but it is so totally different from the group that we know and love today that it is going to come as a shock to those who pick this up for the first time.Ignore those reviews which suggest you avoid the rest of the Ministry catalog--these guys are only gearing up for what has become an increasingly amazing onslaught of mind-bending music!"
1,I cant believe people are giving this 5 stars,"I acidently bought this album on a ministry kick in the early 90's. ALthough its been over ten years since ive listened to it, i distinctly remember its terribleness.If you like 80's music buy Ministry's ""twitch"" or even the ""twelve inch singles"" instead of this. Everything about this album is fake and watered down imatation 80's synth-pop. If you like that sort of thing, then i guess you should get this album, but ill never listen to it again.... ever."
4,Ministry Before Going Thru One Of Most Radical Style Changes in Music History,"I am a fan of Heavy Metal AND Dance/Synth Pop, So I can appreciate BOTH Ministry Styles - the Pop Music of This and the Industrial Metal that came thereafter.What amazes me, however, is the level of musical change this band truly went through from this CD compared to every album that was released after. It sounds like two different bands!Can anyone think of any other musical artist who had this drastic of a change? I can only think of Michael Bolton , but even that wasn't as drastic."
4,Ain't Got Time for What Metalheads Feel!,"This is one of my favorite new wave albums. It features music in the likes of Duran Duran, Simple Minds, and Human League, but with a gothic twist, which fits my mood perfectly. Sure, there are a few too many love betrayal songs and there a couple of bad tracks in my opinion (""Here We Go"" and ""What He Say"") but don't let that discourage you. It's still is a good album with ""Say Your Sorry"", ""She's Got a Cause"", and ""Revenge"" standing out as the best. Revenge to most people is definitely the greatest in the whole album and some of the most quality new wave songs you will ever find in the 80s. Sure, it's another tale of a cheated lover, but a great one at that.I don't know about Mr. Jorgenson today, but this album rules. A must buy for 80s new wave fans."
4,A New/Dark Wave Fan,"This is such a great album. It incorporates different jazzy and percussive and synth bass elements to the synth pop fare. Kinda breaky. I admit the lyrics are a bit thin at times but the vocals sound quite good to make up for it. Twitch, 81-84 12"" and this offering were (in that order) always my favorite Ministry entries though so to hear the notion that Al isn't too fond of it anymore is a bit disappointing. Why cause some of the 'hardcore' fans can't mosh to it and might not understand it's cool to mix it up occaisonally? C'mon Al and I thought you were an r-teest."
2,a dirty abomination of the ministry name,"no matter what else has been written, i'm sorry; as an example of what al jourgensen has proven as his metier, this is a dragging fleshwound of a record fit largely for that cardboard box of records you no longer feel proud of owning that you stow in the basement. as a fleshless danceable bouncy weightless 80's pop record, it's no worse than the Human League or Bananarama, but given the fact that the Ministry name's still hung upon it like some ribbon of diseased liver, it's a sham. don't ponder buying this unless you find it for under $3 (like i did) or unless you're committed to hearing every note St. Al ever spat onto tape. even then, it's a bit of a shock. although it works well for sticking in the car radio and asking your hipster friends who they think this is. when they say ""duran duran"", that's your cue to eject the tape and show them who it really is. buy it from a cutout bin, or don't buy it at all."
1,Yuk,No wonder Al Jourgenson has disavowed this rubbish. Sounds like WHAM crossed with Depeche Mode. Best song is the first track I'm Not a Effigy. Thankfully a better sound would be forthcoming. Better to steal this than buy.
1,Bad bad bad very very bad,"Bought tihsd album onlyto hear what it was like, i had heard it was bad, but i had no idea how badtihs is a definitly no buy"
1,Horrible!,Half a star given for the lack of anything in the cd and half astar taken because he made money off of me. Stick with the nineties Ministry!
4,Al... before drugs,"Ok, so it's not a Ministry album. No distorted walls of guitars, no screaming, no industrial-metal here. This one does have plenty of catchy new wave pop songs complete with Al's pre-distortion faux british accent.Basically, if your introduction to Ministry was Psalm 69, you won't like this. One thing this album does do, though, is show a Ministry fan where Al came from. Just like Twitch is the bridge between this album and Land of Rape & Honey, this album shows you how Al got started. Shards of this album can be heard all the way through LoR&H.; with every album Al shed a piece of his new wave poppy side and eventually began creating songs like ""Burning Inside."" Ever wonder why Al sings with an slight accent in LoR&H;? Well, it all started here."
4,I'm a fan of new wave AND industrial Ministry,"I see alot of ""if you like industrial than you won't like this"" well I actually like both sounds that Ministry had and has created. I love bands such as Siouxsie and the Banshees, Depeche Mode etc...but also love KMFDM, NIN, Skinny Puppy to harder stuff like Slayer, Sepultura, Pantera etc. You will enjoy With Sympathy if you have a open mind. enough said. I agree that ""Revenge"" is THE track on this album. If you catch on VH1 Classic on the program 120 min or The Alternative occassionally they will play the video for ""Revenge"". What a difference to say the video for ""Just one Fix"", but I love variaty in my music."
3,Don't knock a good thing...,"OK, so this is not a prime example of lyrical fortitude or musical genius, but I doubt that is the point. From beginning to end every song is pure, unapologetic, sweet synth-pop. In my humble opinion, it beats the legendary Yaz at their own game. Too bad Ministry chose to change the formula later in its career to a harsh, almost mindless sound. The mystery is what could have so radically (and perhaps demonically) affected Al Jourgensen (Ministry's founder) later on? Be careful when buying a Ministry album: It can be either synth-pop or the extreme opposite (too horrifying to mention)."
4,The best was yet to come,"I bought this as a record a very long time ago & it is excellent. I have continued to be a true fan of Ministry, following them through the years. This is a great example of music of that era. I would recommend every fan buy this, just to see how ministry's music has evolved through the years."
5,I wanted to tell her,"This is one of the better new wave albums that came out of the eighties, I never liked Ministry but this album stands out as one of the best. Tracks like I wanted to tell her, and Effigy are just wonderful. And it seems as if the dj crowd agress because a Ministry vs Soft Cell record was just released. SO do yourself a favor and take a listen to some of the better dance tracks I've ever come across."
4,Great insight into women's efforts during WWII,"I like books of this era, particularly Coming Home by Rosamund Pilcher so picked up Land Girls with great expectations. I was not let down. This novel is a thoughtful character study of how three extremely diverse young women react to the difficulties of farming, isolation, and each other during the frightening days of World War II. I enjoyed that the story is bookended by scenes from the future. This offers greater insight into the girls. Truly a book that will absorb you!"
3,So much potential,"I enjoyed this somewhat simplistic novel, but wish it had dealt a little bit more with the war. If anything, the war merely provided a backdrop for this gentle drama, which came dangerously close to becoming a romance several times, what with all the romantic entanglements in which the young women found themselves involved.Huth's novel is peopled with endearing and memorable characters, but the actual plot left me hungry for something more. Greater depth? Richer detail? A more complicated dilemma? I think I expected to learn more about the Second World War and its effects on the rural communities in England; what I came away was more of a gentle beach read, if you will. Not exactly ""fluff"" but definitely not ""literary"" quality."
2,"Well written, but too shallow","The descriptions of farm work in this book were clear and entertaining. I am assuming they are accurate, although I have no way of knowing. English countryside descriptions reminded me of Thomas Hardy, which is a compliment to the author.However, the plot and characters were stereotypes. The long-suffering wife, the over-sexed lower class girl, the unattractive scholarly girl and the lovelorn dreamy girl, not to mention the hardworking farmer and his brooding, handsome son, are all the stuff of romance novels. I never felt close to the girls, believed in their friendship or really cared what happened to them. I got really tired of and repelled by the over-sexed girl's exploits, and the others' whining.So why did I finish the book? Well, I bought it instead of taking it out of the library, my usual book venue. There was some tension about which girl would get her man. But the ending!! Who could believe that? Ridiculous."
1,Search Engine Optimization with WebPosition Gold review,I purchased this book Search Engine Optimization with WebPosition Gold which included a demo software disk.I found little up to date search engine optimization techniques from cover to cover.The book focuses only on their software program. So I decided to install the software. The software would not allow you to try it without purchasing. I tried emailing to this company without any results; they only encouraged the purchase of their product.Bottom line - this book does not offer any education or real information concerning website and internet optimization. I found a little more useful information in SE optimization for Dummies.I would have rated this book '0 star' but you can only choose from 1-5 ...
1,Google discourages WP Gold.,"I didn't believe this either. But in their guidelines for webmasters, they specifically discourage WP Gold and programs like it, which submit automated queries. They single out WP Gold by name."
2,Looking for more,I like and dislike WPG 2. I liked the Reporter and the Page Critic I think these are the best tools on WPG 2. But I disliked the Page Generator and the Upload Manager they didn't seem to be of much use for me. After becoming computer and e-commerce literate I was aware of all the different things one can add or do to one's site. After the 30 days were up for my trial period I decided not to get WPG 2. I thought the price for the Professional Edition was too much. I found something better. SBI! Check out traffic.sitesell.com/all-in-1.html and you'll see what I mean! Although others successfully use WPG 2 I was looking for something more and I FOUND IT!
5,"by far,my favorite christmas cd","Twenty years ago,I happened to be in a gift shop on the Jersey shore.When I walked into the shop, I was surrounded by this beautiful harp music.Being a music teacher myself I quickly bought a copy of the tape.(CD's were not even available then) Two years ago in a local bookstore,Ihappened to come upon the C.D,and it is almost as worn out as the tape.Since that time I have been searching for anything else of Kim's,but to no avail,until someone suggested I try Amazon."
5,Celtic Christmas by Kim Robertson,AWSOME! I've first heard this harp music by Kim Robertson when I bought a tape over 15 years ago. I listened to it over and over while I was seriously ill in hosp and it was a life saver for my peace and tranquility. I still have the tape but have ordered the CD to play on my Bose which I play often especially during the Chirstmas season.
1,Didn't Work,"I bought a Life-Like train set through Amazon & then ordered this switch. I guess the ""Power-Loc"" designation means it won't work on my track whcih uses rail joiners. I didn't know that. I just knew it was made by the same outfit that made my train set. I am a newbie where model trains are concerned & am learning the hard way. I can't return this because I opened the package. Guess I'll visit my local hobby shop. Being 75, it's easier to order things online if possible. Gonna have to be more careful! I enjoy my train even though I don't have enough space in my apt to have much of a layout. It fits nicely on my table top."
2,"Money, money, money","Ace released this compilation in the wake of the KISS reunion tour and album from 1996, PSYCHO CIRCUS. Just it, to make a few more bucks for himself."
1,"Heroine: Bratty, Bitchy, had a Sadist for a Lover *grimace*","An avid reader, I have ALWAYS finished books, no matter how bad they are, but I didn't finish this one. You can guess just how bad this book is then. Things that really made me mad were:-Ariel is not a virgin; she has a lover who doesn't love her and who she doesn't love. The guy is an S&M kind of guy and it sickened me to read about their ""relationship."" She is also bitchy and bratty and is totally under the control of her murderous, conniving, SOB brothers. (see below)-Hawkesmoor (the hero) is not only scarred from battle, he is strangely naive in his dealings with Ariel's murderous brothers. Come on!-Ariel's brothers. Perfect SOB chauvinists who would murder in cold blood. They brought up Ariel (ewww). They just totally dampened the story that I thought I'd drown in frustration and tears of anger.Save your money. I wished I'd saved mine."
4,i couldn't put it down,"okay, it's like this. this book is REAL. not fluffy, no bimbo stuff here. this book is absolutely realistic. i was reading it the other day, and i couldn't put it down until i finished it!! Touching story. Intriguing. so, why the 8/10 rating? i don't like the ending. i mean, jane feather should've made it a little bit longer to SOLVE the mystery in 'SILVER ROSE'."
3,It was quite nice until the ending was reached,I really enjoyed the book until I started getting nearer to the ending.I didn't like it when no one found out about the secret. I also didn't like the way Ariel and Simon didn't say they loved eachother. It should have continued.
4,Good book,It's a good book and a great trilogy. I would recomend this to anyone who enjoys romance with a little mystery.
1,Definitely not recommended...,"Echoing many other readers, this book definitely lacked many things. I found it boring at times and skipped several pages. Ariel is selfish, stubborn, and very annoying to read about. There was nothing satisfying about this book at all. This book did not provoke any strong emotions and lacked sense at times. This was my first time reading a Jane Feather book and I am definitely not going to read anymore."
1,The Silver Rose,"Awful book even for a romance. Not entertaining, and most of the characters in the book are frustating, including the heroine. A waste of time."
3,The perfect guide for the wealthy restorer,"This book covers all the fundamentals of auto restoration, basing its ""how to"" principles on the complete strip-down of a '57 Chevy. Most of the techniques used are applicable to any vehicle restoration. Unfortunately, the author found it necessary to use the book as a political forum (he's quite clear on his views against environmentalism) and the book almost reads as a 192 page advertisement for one particular company I won't mention. Also, much of the equipment the author refers to is WAY out of the price range of the average restorer. Overall, the book is good for ideas, but I think it's a bit pricey for an advertiser-subsidized publication."
3,In Convertendo only last 30Min,"The ""In Convertendo"" grand motets (5 stars) only last 30Min the rest of the DVD are simply interviews and promotions of other Rameau DVDs. Not a very good deal."
5,"Way to go, Gourd Girls","Gourd Girls came in the mail from a friend who told me that because it was self-published it is hard to find in mainstream bookstores. It is a lovely book in every way, and I'm delighted to see it is now available on Amazon. The writing style is straightforward and engaging. There's a nice mix of narrative about becoming entrepreneurs, creative and spiritual growth, and dealing with the uncomfortable-ness of an alternative lifestyle in a rural mountain area. There's also a good bit of hilarity and an infectious appreciation of what ""foolishness"" can do to lighten our burdens. I think you will like this book as much as I did."
3,Be Ready to Concentrate,"There are two reasons this didn't get four stars. First, with a primary text and two commentators there's a lot of repetition. Second, it's a little dry. The Dalai Lama has since become a much better writer. This book is not for beginners or people looking for the sensational. It is a serious discussion of tantra that demands concentration. Hopkin's supplements contain a nice summary of the doctrine of emptiness, as well as some very handy diagrams of the relationships among Buddhist schools on the issue and even a diagramatic outline of the primary source text. All of this is beneficial for a reader who already has some familiarity with the topic."
1,Dated,"Dated, in the sense that it ardently espouses leftover feminist theory from the early 1970s. Good historical overview of 1970s feminist law, otherwise, for whatever that might be worth (that is, for the class paper you have been assigned to write)."
4,Pyramid,"Hi!I wanted to value this item by using one span from one to ten and to estimate this product with appraisal eight,but you did it already.I don't know what to say further about it.I have five CDs of Alan parsons Project and this one is exactly in the middle due the musical quality.Thanks!"
5,Dear to all Alan Parsons fans,"It is one of the most beloved albums for Alan Parsons fans.I was very much surprised when I recently walked through the outskirts of Valencia, Spain and suddenly saw the Pyramid sign: a bodega here is called Pyramid. The owner must be a real Alan Parsons fan; right next to the Pyramid sign was the Horus logo of Eye In The Sky...But not only for fans: one of the best albums of The Alan Parsons Project, beyond any doubt."
5,ALAN GOES EGYPTIAN,"The third APP offering continued to demonstrate the orchestral genius of Alan Parsons in his thematic albums. PYRAMID focuses on Egyptian mythology involving the cycles of life and death, the quest for immortality. One of the Project's shortest albums, PYRAMID is nonetheless a notable addition to the Parsons catalogue.What makes Parsons music so much fun is his ability to layer the songs thematic elements with imaginative flourishes to keep them interesting. Andrew Powell's brilliant arrangements make both the instrumentals and vocal tracks extraordinary. From the opening VOYAGER to the heartfelt SHADOW OF A LONELY MAN, PYRAMID is a marvelous journey back to the symphonic rock Parsons did so well."
3,Pyramid,"It has 2 decent songs to check out ""What Goes Up..."" & ""Pyramania"". Overall the CD was good, I liked it."
4,Treasure Island meets Blood Meridian,"Brutal, chilling, sinister, wicked; Mac Orlan's tale of a lad among pirates pleases and disquiets. The woodcuts complement the story perfectly. Why isn't Mac Orlan translated into English more often? Like the dark side? Check this out!"
5,excellent movie,"this movie was excellent from start to finish. the movie actually had a moral behind it which some movies dont have, they think because they put rappers in it, it will make people want to see it and then they are disappointed that they wasted their money because the acting isnt any good. this is NOT one of those movies."
5,Virtuoso is right.,"THIS RECORDING IS A MUST FOR THOSE WHO ENJOY TO SIT BACK, RELAX, SIP A GLASS OF WINE, AND TRAVEL TO FARAWAY PLACES WITHOUT THE NOISE, AGRAVATIONS AND IMPOSITIONS OF MODERN LIFE. IN ADDITION TO THAT, THIS RECORDING WILL NEVER GROW OLD ON YOU.JUST LIKE WINE, IT GETS BETTER."
2,Fur Mice,"Did not like them at all. No good quality, so the price was much to high for this type of cat toy."
1,Instrumental,I didn't realize this was only instrumental music with no lyrics. There was no sample music and I didn't see anything telling me that it had no lyrics so I was disappointed when it arrived.
3,Too Short,Beautiful picture quality but there wasnt enough material on these discs to warrant full purchase price. One only had less than 45 minutes of highlights. Good thing this was on a half price sale when i purchased it.
2,Not what I expected,"This DVD set way okay, but short length for the price paid. It also says it has moments from his last show, but does not. I was disappointed overall."
5,"Oh, Johnny!",Everyone loves Johnny Carson. He was the greatest. Have you ever seen the egg trick done with Dom Delouise? It is awesome. Everyone should see it. Enjoy.
2,"Good, but not Great",This collection consists of 2 CDS.There are only two episodes (shows) on each CDof about 30 min ea.So the entire package consists of about 2 hours of material.Some of the audio/video quality is faily low grade.There does'nt seem to be any Re-mastering sone to clean upthe original material
3,Enjoyed it--don't tell anybody.,"Okay, I'm not sure why these attractive women put on their most stylish outfits and highest heels to go stalking around the woods and rocky shoreline, but thank you. Set somewhere remote in Britain, this is long on atmospherics and low on story, with a decent dose of nudity, thanks again. There's some alien probing and a creepy guy in a suit more out of Dawn of the Dead than Men in Black, plus a black slime that seems to mark the victims of extraterrestrial interference. All very entertaining to watch, if not understand. A few borrowed pieces from 2001: A Space Odyssey help, and I enjoyed the surrealistic black and white footage. The black man, (who's the man in black), heralds the coming doom which involves a black, tar-like slime covering the women's bodies. What that means is anybody's guess, but it seems to work for the film. Better acting than most exploitation films sets this one apart. (Don't stop at the end credits--there's more.)"
2,Better in another movie,"The premise of the story is interesting. The acting is stiff and uninspired. The story is better told and performed in the movie ""Were the World Mine>"""
3,good,"I like to listen to this when i'm in the mood for some harder edged 80's pop-metal. 1983-84 was the best period for this type of music, and this has some good songs on it from the era."
5,Long Live The 80's Rock!!,Krokus/Blitz: without a dought is the best album Krokus ever made.It's a rock n'roll master piece..If you never heard them before I would have to say they have the AC/DC sound going for them....It's classic 80's rock at it's best!! If your a big fan of the 80's rock era you have to give Krokus a try..you won't be disapointed!!
4,Good,"Although this album is not quite as good as ""One Vice At A Time"" and ""Headhunter"" it still is very good. The song ""Out Of Control"" is the best song on this album. It has some of the best guitar riffs ever. (BTW, Krokus is from Switzerland, not Canada. There was a band called ""Crowcus"" from Canada, though)"
4,Yea...,"I would give this CD 5 stars if I hadn't yet heard their second release ""REDLIGHT."" I've had this album ever since it came out and it still gets repeated play time on my stereo. The coolest thing about this CD is the 30's-gangster- lounge room-smokey pool joint feel it has. The rhythym section of the band in combination with the melodious brass section, Vic's throaty yankee vocals and funky organ puts you in a mood to sit back and just say ""yea.."" While the best songs on this album are ""Runaway"" ""Sarah"" ""Pedephilia"" and the beautiful ""Our Day Will Come"" the 3 insturmentals speak for themselves with their groove spot sound and overall mastery. Though I feel that ""REDLIGHT"" is their best album, ""Better Late than Never"" is only a few short steps behind. No doubt about it, the Slackers are the best ska band around today, and in general, the coolest, suavest, slickest band ever."
3,Short and not sweet enough.,"I'll rate this DVD 3 stars. 1st for Crystal Knight, 2nd for Tera Patrick, 3rd for the show itself. But don't think that I think it's a great DVD cause it's not. It's good for all the above reasons, but it's only 53 minutes long and it really doesn't show the ""best"" of the show. Now anyone who has ever watched the show knows that one episode is an hour and half long, which is over 30 minutes longer than this DVD. Playboy tv aired a different ""BEST OF 411"" and it was about 10 times better. It also, in my opinion, showed a better overview of the guests that had been on in the past year. This DVD is for really really die-hard fans of the show who don't have cable/satellite access and can't watch it on TV. Otherwise save your money and watch it on Wednesday nights."
3,3 Stars for the Music..5 Stars for the Album Title,"I love all types of dance music, and I felt like owning a new breakbeat mix. This CD seemed like right down my alley. Plus, who wouldn't want an album called ""Land of The Monkey Snake""? This is a pretty good mix. I like the hard breaks and the buzzing bass throughout. The flaw in this album is the repetitivness. He will mix a great song followed by an annoying one and then another great song and so on.... If you are big breakbeat fan, then I'd give this one a listen to. If you arn't a huge fan of this style of music, then you probably won't like it."
4,Manilow's LIVE album is a good compilation of past hits,"Though Barry Manilow included cheesy songs in this album, overall, the album displays the range of pop hits that he had in the past."
5,i have always loved this album,"no matter what anybody says--this is has alwayss been my favorite Manilow album and i truly belivev have many of Barry's recordings in vinyl-cassette--cds, but i never have been able to find LIVE until i found amazon. the most memorable from LIVE are: Why Don't We Live Together(aka dew drop inn)and of course his commercial jingles, which i love hear, but excluding that, he also had an HBO special on at that period of time that included many of songs the LIVE albumm and i will always treasure that and i am thankful i finally found it on CD."
3,They butchered this album on CD,"I too, loved this 2 album set. They butchered this album when they put it on CD. LIVE means that, live. They took out all the bantering Barry did with the audience, his talk of his jingles, everything. That effects the whole character of the album, plus they took off 'Beautiful Music'. What where they thinking? It was a number one seller as a two album set, why wouldn't we love it on 2 cd's? Can we get this re released in its total form? I'd buy it in an instant."
3,"This isn't the whole, original ""Live""?",I absolutely love this album! I read the Amazon reviews and was shocked that the original two record LP album was not transferred in it's entirety to a CD(s).This is Manilow in the blush of fame. All the songs and bits are good. There is so much heart and enthusiasm in this performance. It's a 'must have' for us long time Manilow fans. New fans should have it for the lively and sincere performance.Some...most of the songs move the spirit to another place. That place may be awash in memories -- or be making new ones.
4,Almost Perfect,"Let me start off by saying this is a GREAT album, I was so excited to see they finally released it on CD. However, Arista in its infinite wisdom has decided that the entire album wasnt suitable or something and decided to ""slightly"" edit it for time concerns or money or something. Yes I am probablly very picky, but being a long time fan I was looking for the entire album as my record album has seen better days having played it so often. I sincerely hope that the many fans will tell Arista that they want the ""whole"" album as it was, not as some exec decided it should be, just another CD which it is NOT. Hopefully they will listen and rerelease it with the ""other"" material put back in."
3,Did you think we wouldn't notice?,"People at the record company or whatever you call yourselves today, I grew up in the 70s. I owned the original Barry Manilow Live TWO record set. The head execs who thought we wouldn't notice that half the concert is missing were very much mistaken.I will never buy this CD because I know that some of the best music was cut. Why not turn this into a two disk set and let the fans enjoy the entire concert. The orchestrations are missing, that was some of the best parts.When you release the FULL version of the concert, I will buy it. I want my children to know what good music is. This hip-hop rap garbage is ruining our society and I want my children to know what quality music is all about.Thank you for your time.Sincerely,Kate, Chicago"
1,The size of earings is not same!!!!!,"I buy a gift to my girl friend, but she finds that the size of earings is not the same, one is bigger than the other one. I am so angry about this, this is for valentina`s day"
3,"A little disappointed, but ok!","I bought them for my grandma's birthday. I received them in 3days. However, I noticed a pretty big black speck in one of the diamond stud. The other one is beautiful and sparkly. I was a little disappointed, but I know my grandma wouldn't mind it too much..."
1,Not Clear,"14k White Gold, Round, Diamond Stud Earrings (1/4 cttw, I-J Color, I1-I-2 Clarity)I was reluctant to purchase these earings after reading other reviews,but bought them anyway for a 31st anniversary gift for my wife.Although she wanted to be grateful,I could tell she was disappointed.We are not experts on diamonds, but these were dull and had no sparkle at all.I had purchased a similar pair a while back from Wal-Mart (she lost one)and they had better stones and nicer crowns.Shop before you buy these earings."
2,I sent them back.,"Having read the other reviews I expected something small, but decent. The particular pair I received had two defects: 1. one of the back clasps was bent so that it could not provide the correct tension on the post for reliable wear and 2. one of the stones had a very large, visible black inclusion near the top. It was visible to my naked eye (I don't have a jeweler's loupe) even though it was partially hidden behind one of the mounts. Maybe I just got a bad pair, but given those two problems and the small size of the stones, I sent them back and did not try again."
1,Buyer be ware!!,"I ordered these earrings when they were on sale for $99.00 because I thought they were an excellent deal. After they arrived and I put them on, my fiance noticed (from 6 feet away) that one of the studs had a large black spot right in the middle. I will be sending them back tomorrow."
2,tiny,"much smaller than appear... it may have been a lack of attention payed to the cttw, but it may also have been that the total weight was the two together and not each one separately."
1,Too small earings,"UPSET!! ......Was an unpleasant surprise when I opened the box and see it. because in the photo the earrings look of a perfect size but they are minimal, too small like for a newborn'http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F4BZMS/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title"
3,Too small,"These are extremely small, bought them as a xmas gift for my bf, he does not seem to mind them so................ But if they were for me, I would not have been satisfied."
2,better off getting fakes,"It's not that I'd expect a whole lot from a $99 dollar pair of diamond studs. But honestly, these are sooooo small about 2mm or less each that you can't tell it's diamond at all. They kind of look like metal posts. There's no room for it to even sparkle. After buying these, I went to Macy's and picked up a fake pair of studs that were bigger and they look a lot more like real diamonds than these. You'd do better to save up and get bigger diamonds or just buy the fakes!"
2,Quality Varies Widely!!!,"I ordered these as a gift. Purchased a similar pair for myself, recently and was pleased with quality, but this pair had problems. Had to reorder TWICE (thank you Amazon!), but FINALLY got an acceptable pair, just in time. I disagree with the I1-I2 rating these have. I have purchased diamonds before and knew these were not ""top quality"", but the ones I received seemed far below any I1-I2 rated diamonds I've bought in the past. It seemed to always be a problem with one earring. Perhaps, Amazon could make sure these were better matched, as a pair. Also, these had noticeable scratches and divots on the face or table, which is the most visible part on a solitaire diamond. $100 is a lot of money for lesser quality diamonds. Setting and backs were fine. In the end, all is well; but I'm not sure I would order these again."
3,looks pretty...,I think the earrings look good. They were smaller than I anticipated. I don't buy jewelry a lot. A close up picture next to something of known size would have helped me visualize how big the earrings were. For $99 it's a deal for me!
3,Returned based on quality of product,"I had decided to order this set of diamond stud earrings as a gift for my girlfriend in spite of reading a few reviews with negative comments. I knew that they would be small, which was okay because I thought they would be nice for everyday use, and my problem was not with the size but the quality of the diamonds. One earring had a small black spot along the outer edge of its diamond and the other earring had two large and easily visible white cloudy areas inside of its diamond. These defects were visible to the naked eye and I decided it was not worth the risk of any disappointment as a gift and so I returned them. I would not recommend the earrings as a gift but perhaps they are okay for personal use. They were quite sparkly despite their interior flaws."
4,cute earings,"I bought these earings as a gift for my sister and she loved them.I had paid $99 for the pair which is a great price, but I do wish they were a bit bigger. That is why I gave them 4 stars. Other than that they are great."
2,Poor performance.,"This printer was free with a purchase of a PC, and that's the only reason I did not give it a ONE star rating!The paper feeds incorrectly and jams the machine. This happens with every print job. You have to hand feed the sheets to keep them from ripping. Also, the default print settings can not be changed from the factory settings. You have to set up a print profile and check it every time.I would not recommend this product."
3,Ink hard to find,"I have had no problems with my z25 printer. It feeds just fine and does not rip up the paper. I have my settings saved as far as the way it prints. The only thing I have problems with is the warning box that keeps appering up on my screen at odd times to let me know I'm low on color ink, and the fact that Ink is hard to find for this printer. If anyone can help me here I would be greatful."
2,Brand new printer - no black ink & no USB Cable,I can't believe that a brand new printer does not come with BLACK ink. I called the customer service. They said you had to buy it separately. A very bad impersion to start. Think before you make an order.
1,"Jams, smears, crawls at 6 min. per page. What's not to like?","This is my second Lexmark. I would never buy another. I only bought this second one because it was being sold at a fundraiser for my sister-in-law's chorus. It was brand new. First thing is that Consumer Reports wrote that the Lexmark ink is the most expensive of all the printer mfgrs.I'm printing a Christmas newsletter on it. Gripe 1: The side with 6 pictures takes six minutes to print. Gripe 2: The black ink was half used after 40 pages! (This poor speed and ink performance is nowhere close to the specs Lexmark provides.) Gripe 3: The worse thing is that just like with my old Lexmark, the feed mechanism grabs unevenly, and the paper gets jammed. Or it doesn't grab at all. Gripe 4: After a major jam, it smeared ink on the backs of the next 10 pages, wasting lots of expensive paper and ink before I noticed it.I have to babysit this thing. I hate it!"
1,Poor Performer,This is one of the worst printers you can buy. It runs out of ink very fast and cartridges cost more than the printer at about $30 per pop for a black one. The paper always gets fed in too fast and becomes slanted and jams. It is horrendous. Spend more for a high-quality HP printer . It is definately worth more than working with this peice of junk!!
1,Immediate Problems,"The printer feeds paper inconsistently; the print is always crooked because of the uneven feed. You can not print any text with the lower quality of print because the text is garbled. I will return this printer, but unfortunately will be stuck with the ink cartridge that had to be purchased seperately....."
1,Lexmark just play tricks,"A printer doesn't use standard printer cable, and doesn't come with the who-knows-what non-standard USB cable. Just go get any other printer."
1,"problems, poor design, don't even take it for free!!","I got this printer as a free with purchase promo. The ink was virtually non-existent. When I want to print, I have to guide each sheet into the printer. Save yourself the shipping and handleing and move onto another product."
1,disposable,"The price is good, but what they don't tell you when you buy this printer is that you will need 1 of the 2 ink cartridges in about a month with just casual use. Oh yea, uh, the 2 cartridges are 50 bucks.Don't waste your time or money unless you're using it as a disposable printer."
1,It's a mistake!,"I never care to write any review before, but I have to write something this time for people who are thinking to buy this printer. The price may sound good, but it's tricky. It doesn't come with a black ink catridge. It's noisy, and you have to be very careful about the paper jam, too. I would rather to get an old HP deskjet. It works much better."
2,"Average product, loses thread very easily","I bought this comforter about 10 months ago and it seems like a product with a life span of around 6 - 8 months. Beyond that, it starts losing thread and you will find threads just all over the place.My experience with this satin comforter makes me conclude that it is better to use satin sheets for external shine and beauty and instead use cotton comforters. The threads coming off is definitely a big issue."
3,Luxury Satin Queen Comforter - Is ok beginners comforter,This comforter is very smooth and looks very elegant on a bed with satin sheets. It is very soft and however if you have a rough feet it will give you the irritating sense of your rough feet scraping with the smooth sheet. I am wearing a sock now and thoroughly enjoying this new comforter. A definite Yes!!
5,Good stuff!,"My wife used Euphoria for a long time. I'm a fan of more of a sweet, fruity type smell, so I bought this for her for Christmas without having smelt it. We both really like it! Of course, that is, we really like it on HER! LOL!"
4,"MUCH better than Lopez' ""Live""","If you've smelled ""Live"" by Jennifer Lopez, don't turn your nose up at ""Live Luxe"" before testing it. It is a much better fragrance. It's bold and citrusy and not to sweet and stuffy like ""Live."" Good scent for when you're feeling (or want to feel) confident/sassy."
2,It's suffocating and i'm disappointed,Absolutely not my type of fragrance. i was absolutely fooled by the other reviews. If frustratingly sweet is your fragrance then go right ahead and make the purchase. The odor of this perfume leaves me gasping for air. Look it's quite above par for its price and Jlo didn't just put her name on it....she probably had input in the fragrance oils. But live is just too much for my senses...i would give it to my mom since she likes it so much...But i don't want to ever smell this again...so she won't be keeping it either. I'll have to find a stranger...cause the return policy on Amazon for fragrances seems to be more than i need. i should of spend my cash and order something better.
4,GREAT BUY!,"SHIPPING WAS QUICK. I LOVE THIS SCENT & WHO NEEDS THE BOX, WHEN YOUR JUST GOING TO THROW IT AWAY ANYWAY. GREAT PRICE! WILL BE LOOKING FOR OTHER GREAT BUYS LIKE THIS 1 ON FRAGRANCES."
2,Very Fruity,"This has a very sharp fruit scent like grapefruit to it. I don't care for it although at first I liked it but now I hate it! The dry down is what irks me, way too tangy. I loooooovvvvve the Live perfume but then something was tweeked to make this awful stuff! I put my small bottle away and it will stay there in the closet forvever!"
3,Better than I expected...,"Well, I was pleasantly surprised when I actually enjoyed this scent, as, I've detested most of J. Lo's scents. Live Luxe is the first follow-up to Live. It is a fruity floral, created by perfumer Claudette Belnavis. The notes include pear, peach, melon, apple, muguet, amethyst freesia, honeysuckle, diamond musk, amber, vanilla and sandalwood.Personally, I find Live Luxe zesty, light and clean. It smells very feminine and carefree. When I wear Live Luxe it actually relaxes me. Live Luxe isn't the usual fragrance that I'm drawn to, but I like this one (not love). Live Luxe is also good for layering with CSP's Vanille Canelle. The Vanille Canelle gives it a stronger base with a bit more depth.I wouldn't repurchase this as, it's not in the fragrance family that I'm drawn to, but it's worth a try!"
1,Save Your Money!,"This perfume smells AWFUL. Period. There is no way to even sugarcoat it; it's discusting. Purchased it online without knowing what it smelled like. Do not waste your money on this product. It doesn't smell floral or fresh, just gross."
1,sucks!,"like two weeks to deliver and they send me a ""NAUTICA"" instead of what i order...never got responce from seller..dont waste your time and money here!"
3,Interesting movie,"Enjoyed this movie very much, especially since it was a truestory, Some parts were hard to believe, but very interesting."
2,"Well done, but out of date","It's an interesting tale about the F.B.I. spy, Robert Hanssen; nevertheless, overtaken by events.A young F.B.I. employee was planted in Hanssen's office and gathered evidence against him for about a year prior to his arrest. But this was not allowed to be discussed when MASTER SPY was produced, accounting for a puzzling ambiguity as to the central character's motivation.That's my only objection. Otherwise, entertaining."
3,Good music...bad sound quality.,"I love this group, have since the late 70's, but after listening to the quality of it, I think I will search for the Essential Alan Parsons c.d. and hope it's remastered."
5,Awesome,"The product was just was described. Item shipped and recived in less time then stated. Very happy, would do business with again."
5,One of my all-time favorites of anyone!,"I bought this as a tape long ago. I played it over and over and LOVED it! The tape has long worn out, and I replaced it with the CD. I cannot think of any song on the album that I only ""like."" I LOVE them all!"
5,My Unit in Vietnam,"I was in Charlie Company 2nd/28th from March 1968 to March 1969. The writers started interviewing GI's who were in country from April 1969 on. I've had the book since shortly after it was published but had never read it. I'm not into reading so I ordered the tapes to listen to on a recent cross country flight. I felt that after 42 years it was time to read the book. It brought back memories and flash backs as well. I even remember guys like Harris, Selig, Skeels, Capt. Rogers, Abbott, Goings and Bowers. For someone who is not into reading these are the perfect solution. Also for anyone who wants a fairly accurate description of how it was for us Grunts in Nam buy this book."
4,"Classy, Safe and Not Overbearing","Paris Hilton Just Me for Men cologne got a safe yet classy scent that is good for everyday use. The strong, main scent upon spraying doesnt last long on you(a couple of hours at most), though a modest good base of jasmine-like smell stays throughout.Its pretty good, and I get decent compliments from mortals and goddesses alike.Its good for everyday use as I said, or even for formal occassions. But if youre looking for the rugged, manly type of cologne, I suggest Michael Jordan cologne or Dirty English by Juicy Couture."
2,smells good,It took so long to get here over 2 weeks. And it's not pink it's black don't know why they show a pink bottle. Mine when it got here was in a black box and black bottle.
5,gracias llego en el tiempo estimado,excelente producto me llego en el tiempo estimado es un producto de calidad me encanto y recomiendo al vendedor son completamente originales
3,Hubby liked it,"Got it 2nd time , coz husband liked it 1st time i bought for him :)Lets see how it turns out this time."
5,Great Perfume,If you have in your office many girls is very ideal used this to take the calmed and agree with you in everything
1,solucion de un problema,"buenas noches, necesito hablar con ustedes, yo realice la compra del siguiente perfume y no me llego, la compre junto 3 perfumes mas que usted mismo vende, y me llegaron esos 3 y este no me llego, necesito saber el motivo, y necesito que me devuelva el dinero o que me enviÃ© el perfume el cual le compre, yo soy de Venezuela, y enviÃ³ las compras con la empresa libertyexpress , y ellos me dicen que a su oficinas de miami solo les llegaron esos 3 perfumes necesito este perfume por favor.good night, need to talk to you, I make the purchase the next perfume and I get the next 3 perfume buy rather than sell yourself, and I got those 3 and it does not get me, I need to know the reason, and I need my money back or send me which perfume you buy, I'm from Venezuela, and sent the company purchases libertyexpress, and they tell me that his Miami office reached them only those 3 need this perfume perfumes please ."
3,Nice story,"However, I miss all the marketing aspects that boosted the company to where it is now.Nice book if you want to know the real story of Subway's beginnings."
4,Quick and very helpful,"I saw a review for this book somewhere online, and immediately thought that my boyfriend would love it since he's thinking about starting his own business. He's currently serving a prison sentence in Texas, and I wanted to get this for him as a little gift. I let the seller know that it was going to a correctional institution, and they were extremely willing to help make sure it got to him in a timely manner without any issues. The communication was prompt and professional and I felt good about working with them. My boyfriend got the book with no problem which made me really happy and he's enjoying it very much. I would definitely buy from this seller again."
4,Very Inspirational & Motivational,"This books goes to show you that with hard work & perseverance anyone can be successful. You also find out that ""Success"" means different things to different people.Some of the stories are repetitive, but that just goes to support the idea that anyone can do it, in any industry."
2,316 pages?!?,"I can't believe the same basic story was retold countless times over 316 pages. If you want to save a little time and money I will condense it for you: ""x"" wants to start a business but had little money or experience but through hard work and perseverance ""x"" overcame his/her obstacles and now heads a very successful business.Fifteen ""Key Lessons"" paralleled with Fred DeLuca's Subway experiences and then reinforced by a truly amazing story of how ""x"" also learned this chapters ""Key Lesson"".The stories are interesting at first but become tired in a short period of time. Perhaps it would be more palatable if it were not read in one sitting.The sandwiches are great - the book a little lacking."
5,Not one boring page!,"This book would be an inspiration to just about anyone, whether starting up a new business or not. It was beautifully written but most impressive was that there were no boring parts. Often a book will have some good sections and much dead area. ""Start Small Finish Big"" is just jam packed with one interesting story after another of people who struggled and overcame obstacles in order to create their businesses. The fifteen key lessons are great and wonderful examples are given of each, both by the business owners Fred DeLuca chose and by Fred himself. Great job!!!"
4,cerrone x-xex,"Based on its traditional disco sound, a aggiornato Cerone adapted to changing times, more modern and relaxed. For cerrone's lovers, a record more than pleasant.Con base en su tradicional sonido disco, un aggiornado cerone adaptado a los cambios de tiempos, mas moderno y relajado. Para amantes de cerrone, un record mas que agradable."
2,left out best part,"I bought the DVD because of the brawl in the crowd that caused the last match to be stopped. The fights where Ok, but I was waiting on the end of the main event. When a few cups where thrown in the ring they stopped playing coverage and put on the screen why the match was stopped. If I buy a DVD about Ultimate Fighting why would I not want to see 200 people fighting in the crowd?"
1,the Italian cooking encyclopedia,"Ilove this cook book, I have it myself, I purchased this one as a gift, the book is out of print, I was dissapointed when it arrived with a cracked cover, the book was discribed as used but in excellent condition, needless to say I can't give it as a gift, now I have 2....I don't think I would buy a used book from amazon again."
1,Don't buy PNY -- unethical company,"I bought a PNY graphics card that recently died. The card has a lifetime replacement warranty, so I thought ""no problem, I'm covered."" Sounds simple. HOW WRONG I WAS. I bought the card in December 2002, so the thing is not yet 3 years old. It turns out that PNY considers the life of a video card to be 1 year (or so, they're not very specific) and refuses to service my card under the lifetime replacement warranty.I don't know about all you, but I consider my computer equipment to have a lifetime of more than 1 year, and even 4-5 years as I pass my old machine on to the kids.Bottom line: PNY doesn't have the ethics of a company I'm willing to deal with. I'd look somewhere else if I were you."
5,OUT OF PRINT,"Argile Stox was released from his publishing contract with PublishAmerica on April 20, 2006. His book, Computer-End Program, ISBN 1-4137-2496-5 is now OUT OF PRINT."
4,Good Puzzle for the Price,"My first Puzz 3D experience... pretty cool! Good price for the puzzle, a little challenging but didn't take too long. 3D is ""a whole new dimension"" in puzzle building if you haven't tried it. The puzzle is better than my humor!!"
5,Perfect song for a perfect finale,"I would've placed a comment earlier, but I've been too busy trying to locate this EVERYWHERE! I logged onto HBO.COM to find out who this was and the remix name. The next morning I wasted no time and found it listed on Amazon.com -with ONE left. Naturally, while placing the order, it had (apparently) sold. I've searched everywhere with little luck, and I'm a bit aprehensive to send money overseas on just a 'promise' of this album. AMAZON if you know what's good for you, your buyers should already be tracking this down. Beautiful voice and excellent remix -I had no idea she had so many other offerings. I've spoken with some friends who were also impressed with the song and equally clueless; they were surprised to hear she was from Alabama (they, unlike me, are native to AL)! PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE restock this item, and I guarantee you'll have difficulty keeping them instock."
5,My Favorite Passover Book,"I began reading this book every year at Passover to my daughter when she was age 2. I haven't read the book in a few years and I had to call my daughter to borrow the book, she is 31 now. We both shared memories and tears as we re-called Passover's past and the heartfelt meaning in the story. You are never too old to believe the Elijah will come one year to your house at Passover."
1,WASTE OF MONEY,"FOR ME, THIS PURCHASE WAS A WASTE OF MONEY, WAS NOT FUNNY AND VERY BORING., I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS."
4,memories,"I had been looking for routine from Tommy Davidson that I had remembered from years ago. I was so happy to find out that it was on this dvd because I was just ordering Robert Townsend for nostalgic purposes. Robin Harris also debuts his ""be be kids "" routine. 4 stars because the stand ups r funny, the skits are not."
5,Poignant True Story by Journalist Gravely Injured in Iraq,"Michael Weisskopf's true story about his coverage of Iraq during which he comes under fire and loses his hand draws the reader into his life and keeps him there till the last page. The grisly facts and the heroic military men he meets throughout his journey not only shed light on the sad truths of war, but place the reader directly into Michael's shoes. A great read for anyone wanting to know what really happens to soldiers in a contemporary war."
5,Stories of Recovery,"Michael Weisskopf is a well known journalist for TIME magazine. During a trip to Iraq as an embedded journalist with an Army unit, the HMMWV he was riding in had a grenade thrown into it. Weisskopf apparently went to pick the grenade up before it detonated, but was too late, losing his right hand in the explosion.Weisskopf uses this tragedy to document his and a several soldiers with amputations in their roads to recovery at Walter Reed Army Medical Center's Ward 57, the amputee ward. Weisskopf does a good job of capturing the many aspects of recovery that he and the soldiers go through.This short book captures very well the processes of recovering from combat wounds, dealing with the traumas both to yourself and those around you, including fellow soldiers who did not survive their accidents.I highly recommend this book."
3,Cantus comes thru with strong performance,"Being a vocal coach and choir director, I'm always excited when an all-male, classical trained ensemble makes it big on the national scene. This is a very good album. My only criticism is the collective vibrato of their tone on Franz Biebl's AVE MARIA and some of the other pieces. The Biebl is one of my favorite works and sounds better if done with more of a straight tone. In fact, many of the pieces on this album and volume two would sound more pleasing if CANTUS would eliminate or at least minimize their vibrato. At times, it reminds one of a taped recording that isn't playing at exactly the right speed."
4,Cantus Christmas selection,This is a very nice album to put on in the background. Especially if you like the unusual. Very calming acapella music done with interesting arrangements and classical vocals.
4,trashy gay cinema with a bite,"I am a huge fan of trashy cinema. Sordid Lives is probably my favorite gay movie. Beverly Kills is right up there with that. The two boys are adorable and in fact, all of the guys in the movie are gorgeous and either wear absolutely nothing or next to nothing throughout the whole movie which is a plus. Unlike most low-budget gay romantic comedies this doesn't take itself so seriously, is quite witty, and leaves you feeling great. If you are easily offended or don't have an absurd sense of humor then you should probably look elsewhere as this one is scathing and out there. I saw this at a film festival in Arizona and loved it but with the DVD I was able to listen to the director's commentary. It is enlightening and made me appreciate this movie even more. The musical numbers in the gay theater are absolutely hysterical."
2,It has a musty smell,"I think I received an old product. It has a musty smell. I have tried to wear put it it on, but the smell bothers me."
5,Some of the Historia ! ! ! ! !,"Nuestra Historia is the title of this album from Banda El Recodo la Madre de las Bandas, this group got this name because is one of the first to star this kind of music, straight from Sinaloa Tierra Caliente, they carry on the heat of it's music, very traditional, in this cd Banda el Recodo put together some of the best tracks Que Solo estoy sin ti, Pena tras pena, Cada vez te extrano mas, Y llegaste tu, Hasta cuando, Moviendo la cadera, Que bonita and many more some to dance some to drink to and some to feel like a Narco if you like Narcocorridos this cd is pack with all this diffrent styles, a good place to star if this is your first time listening to this beatiful music style."
2,Did not fit well.,"This product was cute, but did not fit the phone well. The snaps were very hard to get clicked together. We got it on the phone, but one side refused to click. It lasted about 2 months until it broke."
1,Good actors can't help this movie,"I've enjoyed Bill Pullman and especially Lena Olin in many other films. However, the screenplay and directing of Ignition is very poor. There was no Ignition. There are many superfluous elements that should have left on the Editor's Table. The dialog and action were never succinct. They were hard put to come to a conclusion. The actors were never prompted to perform to their capabilities. All in all I couldn't wait for the movies to finish. Nothing worked well."
2,"Cartoonish, a bit of fun","Much worse than you might expect given such a sterling cast (Olin and Pullman.) Plenty of cheesy stuff with Pullman over the top as tough-guy type trying to protect ""bitchy"" federal judge from all sorts of bad guys."
5,Surprise! It was good.,"Picked up this DVD mainly because I was looking for something starring Bill Pullman. Very, very good. Kept me interested from start to finish. Do yourself a fav and pick one up. Nuff said..."
5,FIVE STAR TOP SHELF SERVICE,"Before the King of Cool there was Peter Gunn. Private Investigator with a blonde girl friend torch singer who had a permanent gig at Mothers. Tough in a calm, cool way he solved crimes,listend to jazz and His girlfriend's great voice. These two episodes are typical of the series and, of course, feature cool,smooth jazz by Henry Mancini."
2,didn't work; way overpriced,"This is way overpriced in my opinion. It didn't really last too long, and it didn't help. I stopped using it. At $28, you'd think it would work better. A big waste of money."
1,28 bucks really??? RIPOFF!,First of all you have to be a window licker on the short bus to buy this product or just filthy rich. I tried this at a friend's house and then compared the ingredients to Neutrogena's post shave balm and many of the ingredients were the same. Don't waste your money on this overpriced product when there are cheaper products available that do just as good a job. Neutragena post shave lotion feels just as good if not better and you can find it for under 10 bucks!!
4,Makes a difference,Gave this to my husband for Christmas and he says he can definitely feel a difference after using only once. He has very thick hair and suffers from ingrown hairs all the time. He says that his face feels smoother and hasn't had and problems since using it. He also loves the smell.
5,shaving relief,"A great product to use after shaving. Doesn't dry your skin out like other products that contain alcohol. I really appreciated the fact that you spray the product on, since rubbing in aftershave or moisturizer immediately after shaving makes my skin irritated. Just spray it on and that's it. Works really well with the Advanced Shave Formula too."
4,annonymous,"i first heard hiroshima a couple of years ago and not knowing what they actually sounded like partly because the guitarist or the singers weren't with the band at the time, i decided to buy one of their cds for the peaceful japanese music they played on the show. i finally listened to the cd tonight and was pleasantly surprised by the jazz fusion sound and the quality of the music. i don't think very many people know the band as well as they should maybe because of their name not really recognized as the name of a band that would play good jazz fusion. also, i've yet to hear them played on any radio station. if you like jazz then this cd tinged with a japanese music edge is a good way to start listening to this particular band. the singers are very good and you'll get some singing and some music without the singers. hiroshima deserves critical as well as american recognition."
4,"Great to listen to, better in live performance.","I am a bit biased regarding Hiroshima, since their leader, Dan Kuramoto, is my cousin. Relationships aside, Hiroshima's music, both old and new, is refreshing to listen to, but their concerts are much better. Their recent performance @ the opening of the L.A. Japanese-American Museum has resulted in new fans, according to the attendees that I spoke with. ""East"" CD is a better CD."
4,Hiroshima,Easy to listen to. Spend a Saturday morning doing light chores while listening to this CD.
3,"TRACK LISTING FOR ""ALL ALONE""","Track listing for Sinatra's ""All Alone"" album, released in 1962:1) ""All Alone""2) ""The Girl Next Door""3) ""Are You Lonesome Tonight?""4) ""Charmaine""5) ""What'll I Do?""6) ""When I Lost You""7) ""Oh, How I Miss You Tonight""8) ""Indiscreet""9) ""Remember""10) ""Together""11) ""The Song Is Ended""**NOTE: The Jimmy Van Heusen/Sammy Cahn song, ""Come Waltz With Me,"" was recorded at the same session, but was left off the album. Sinatra felt that the song just didn't fit."
5,If even for one song,"This is obviously an underrated masterpiece but I am writing this review for the sake of one performance on this record - Sinatra's version of ""What'll I do?"" Sinatra has recorded dozens of masterpieces but there is something about his performance of this song - the saddest reflection of love lost ever written - that brings me to tears every time I hear it. Sinatra himself said he could only sing it a few times - it was just too hard. ""When I'm alone, with only dreams of you, that won't come true, what'll I do?"" That sums up the feeling everyone has had at the end of a relationship. It is awful. Truly awful and if you listen to it you know you are in the presence of someone who has been there too."
5,all alone,shame on you Nancy what were you thinking i have moved my lp to tape and now cd piease release on cd it was your fathers 50th birthday album pure gold cdalton
4,A Long-Awaited but Flawed Release,"I've been a huge Jobriath fan for years, owning both his collectable Elektra LPs, and while it's fantastic to finally see a CD release for this material (there was never even a second printing of the LPs, and both have been unavailable for years), I do have a few quibbles as to the song selection. While a lot of his great songs are here, a few of my favorites, off his second, and in my opinion better album are missing. This is inevitable when condensing two albums into one, but since is the only taste the public can have of Jobriath, I find it a shame that so many tracks will go permanantly AWOL. In any case, a tragically overlooked artist, a real original who's well worth hearing. If you're a glam rock fan you've gotta have it, as well as anyone interested in gay pop stars."
1,dissapointed,"As the parent of a child with Down syndrome, I was disappointed with some of the ""wording"" in this book. When I explained this to a friend, she asked if the author is from England. Yes, the author is from England. Apparently they are not as ""politically correct"" as we try to be.I bought this book for my 5 year old nephew in the hope that he will have a better understanding as to why his cousin has some ""differences"". I can not give this book to him, or anyone else for that matter. I feel that book places too many labels and places more focus on ""why they look so different""."
2,DVD-Audio only marginally better than my aluminum Mobile Fid,Yep...I bought this DVD-Audio and was expecting something great. What I got was no LFE and scant use of my surrounds (mostly ambient concert-like reverb). One spot of praise is the lack of tape hiss. Too bad about the rest of it...this recording could really sing (moreso than the 2 channel version already does) if remastered correctly.
5,THE PERFECT CD,"THIS IS THE PERFECT PROGRESSIVE ROCK DISC.ITS OUTSTANDING IN EVERY WAY INCLUDING WELL WRITTEN,ARRANGED MUSIC BY PARSONS,WOOLFSON AND POWELL.TREMENDOUS SOUND QUALITY DUE TO THE EXCELLENT PROFESSIONALISM AND ENGINEERING AS WELL AS THE PRODUCTION OF ALAN PARSONS.GREAT SOFT ROCK RHYTHM SECTION WITH VARIOUS INSTRUMENTATION PLAYED BY VERY TALENTED MUSICIANS BACKED BY ORCHESTRA AND CHOIR.THERE'S A GOOD VARIETY OF FINE VOCALISTS IN THE BAND AND WELL WRITTEN LYRICS WITH AN IMPORTANT MESSAGE.THIS CONCEPT ALBUM RELEASED IN 1977 HAD A PROPHETIC MESSAGE ABOUT THE RISE OF THE MACHINE AND THE DECLINE OF MAN.35 YEARS LATER,THERE MAY BE SOME TRUTH TO THIS SINCE WE'VE BECOME A TECHNOLOGICAL SOCIETY RELYING SO MUCH ON COMPUTERS,CELL PHONES,THE INTERNET AND HAVING TO DEAL WITH THE PRIVACY ISSUES THAT COME ALONG WITH IT.THE ALAN PARSONS PROJECT'S 'I ROBOT' DISC IS A GEM AND A TRUE MASTERPIECE DONE BY A BUNCH OF VERY SMART GUYS.GO FOR IT.ENJOY. DAN"
1,Buy the Audio CD and save your dough,"This is one of my favorite albums and after the re-engineering work on Fleetwood Mac's Rumours and The Eagles' Hotel California and ELP's Brain Salad Surgery I was prepared for something special by one of the premiere producers of all time.Boy was I dissapointed. This disk (we're talking about the DVD-Audio) is nothing more than a 24 bit transfer of the master tape. Not DTS, not Dolby Digital, nuthin'! I listened to the CD and this disk on the same equipment and could tell way too little difference to warrant the expense. Save your dough.And shame on you A. P. Get off your duff and remix this for 5.1 or stay out of the DVD-Audio market. This is very deceptive. At the very least make sure the sound quality is so much better that the price is justified."
2,Not DVD Audio,"I ordered this disc, believing the description. This is a 24/96 disc. There is one high resolution STEREO version of the album on this disc. True DVD Audio usualy contains high resolution surround as well as stereo. There are usualy Dolby & DTS versions too. I was disapointed with this disc. Having said that, the stereo high resolution tracks on this disc are first rate."
2,THIS IS NOT A DVD-AUDIO DISC!!!!!!!,"As a huge fan of the new DVD-Audio format I was really looking forward to hearing this disc. As it turns out this is not a DVD-Audio disc but is instead, an audio only dvd or DAD disc. While it is a nice clean mix with utilization of center and surround speakers (sometimes) it does not make use of the sub at all. The sound is in no way comparable to a DVD-Audio disc. I do not think [this]is worth the minor improvements to the sound."
4,"GOOD, BUT....",...The ingenuity and rock timeliness of Parsons comes through with pristine studio clarity and definition. Electronic music has a good companion in the electro mediums of CD and DVD.
5,Tunes from the 70's and 80's when I was in school,Great music. Converted my old obsolete vinyl Albums to CD with this purchase and then downloaded into my MP3 player. Listen to all the oldies driving to and from work. It brings me back to College days listening to the tunes I grew up on.
2,what if the world really was ran by robts??,"I was at my cousan's house and we were listenening to these old tapes that were in a shobox. It was really funny. This is nothing like the music or today. This is the music you hear in groshery stores. We also listened to pink floyd the wall, dark side of the moon, and the first cut. These were a little better becuase they sound all angry and loud and how they hate school."
5,Top 5 rock album of ALL TIME!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is the Project's best album and it's one of the best albums you will ever hear. Drag yourself away from Britney, clones, light rock pablum, white rap, three chord ""indie"" gunk and listen to some of the most complex and yet VERY accesible pieces of music ever done. Rush and buy it now, you won't be dissapointed. It holds up better than virtually any album from the latter half of the 70s. At the same time, it rocks. THIS is what made FM radio great! If you buy no other Project work, get this."
4,Quick Response,Product came quickly with no damage. Not bad for being a used product. I would shop with this provider again.
5,This CD is better than I had remembered back in the 1970's & 1980's.,Of the three Alan Parsons CD's I received a month ago this one is really better than I had remembered. This CD is great.
1,This is NOT a DVD-Audio Disc,"I purchased this disc thinking that it was a DVD-Audio disc. My first clue was the non DVD-Audio case that the cd comes in. The second clue was the blue light that failed to come on indicating a DVD-Audio track. This disc is a DAD (Digital Audio Disc). It is mastered at a higher rate than regular cd but contains no multi-channel information. It still must be played on a DVD video player through the 5.1 channel inputs. For the price, this disc should be a lot more."
3,Meh,"Buy it if you're a prog-rock fan, but it is wat to boring with quite a few bad songs. There are, although, a couple good ones: tracks 3, 4, and 5."
1,Very Poor - No Surround,Very dissapointing. This is a stereo only version. Save the money and time it takes to get it and buy the CD .. it's much better.
1,NOT DTS or 5.1!!!!!,"Waste of money. If you already have the audio CD don't bother with this one. If you want an Alan Parsons Project album to listen to, go buy the group's DTS ""On Air"" album. I am sure all you audiophiles out there will agree that the DTS version of ""On Air"" is money well spent."
1,i robat,save your money. this is Not a DVD-audio or DVD-video it is a DAD what ever that is. my first generation cd sounds better.this is a poor excuse for a multi-channel disc.
1,not worth it,"As a British expat living in the U.S. of A. I was curious about the author's experiences in Iraq given that both my native and adopted countries started the current debacle.I don't know what the other reviewers from the UK saw in this book (""riveting prose?"") but I was quite disappointed. Poorly constructed narrative that wandered this way and that often as not without reaching any point at all. Insights that were so obvious I didn't feel they merited the term. The author may be a good journalist but this book was poorly conceived and executed. Apparently this is his second book. I won't be reading his first."
1,Don't get it,"I went to hear Matthew McAllester speak a couple of months ago in Chicago and I was impressed with his articulateness and was really interested in reading about his personal story. That personal story was barely present in this book and what was there was a jumbled mess. A weird stream of consciousness that will confuse you even if you're well-versed on recent Iraqi history. Did McAllester write this book, or did he just give his assembled notes to some editorial assistant who tried to write a story around them? I wanted to know more about his relationships with the other journalists, with his girlfriend, with his family. The attempt at political analysis is so clearly off-base I can't believe that even the author believes it. I don't get the disparity between the moving talk I heard and the boring mess that this book is. And I recommend that others don't get it at all. Total waste of time and money."
2,a mixed bag,this book was a way mixed bag but not meriting some of the praise or the criticism given on this sight. this author does emotions superbly; analysis not so well. perhaps he should have decided earlier what which he wanted this book to be about.
1,a wasted opportunity,"I was looking forward immensely to this book, having read much of the author's travails in the press. i was disappointed then to find he had much to tell of his own hopes and fears and far too few of the iraqi people's. the title of the book promises an inside into the trauma of a people imprisoned for decades and then released. we learn too little of their release, their ""blinding in the sunlight."" this book promises much but reads like a rush job. a more thoughtful exploration might have served better to reflect the suffering of the ordinary people and what must have been and still must be an epic battle to free themselves of the warped psychology of saddam's era. i hope another account, yet to be written, will serve as a better testament to history and human spirit, not just an author's ago."
2,Was expecting more insight and intelligence,I think that if you are looking for someone to justify the Iraq campaign now that the WMDs are known to not exist this is the book for you. In describing the life Iraqis led under Saddam's rule the author tries to convey that Iraq's future is more promising now than it would have been if Saddam were still in power. I did not find the author's reasoning to be convincing but maybe that is because this book was not well edited. I am not sure if Mr. McAllester really understands what is going on in Iraq or if the jumbled and at times contradictory analysis is due to poor editing. I think I would have preferred if he had concentrated on presenting his own rather incredible story about being a prisoner for eight days in Abu Ghraib prison in Baghdad. As it is this book is neither fish nor fowl and I did not find it to be satisfying reading.
1,Of interst only to the author's friends and family,"Journalists often give political analyses of situations they have reported on, and all too often reach facile and laughably naive conclusions. Such is the case with this book. The author might have given us an interesting read if he had stuck to what he is qualified to comment on: himself and his experiences as a journalist. Whether out of false modesty or an inflated sense of his grasp of the situation in Iraq, he chose to weave his personal story around the much larger, vastly more complicated, and more important story of what is happening to the Iraqi people. His conclusions about whether the Iraq invasion was warranted are unsupported, and blatantly self-serving. It can't be a coincidence that a young man who received a large advance to write a book about his experiences during the invasion of Iraq sees the campaign as necessary and ultimately for the best. It certainly was for him!"
4,Danny Kaye was always incredible,"The only reason I did not give this five stars is that the material after the duet with Louis Armstrong gets repetitious. It was not on the original videotape but was added for the DVD. However all the original selections, which is the majority of the DVD, are classic and outstanding, with guest appearances by Lucille Ball, Louis Armstrong, Harry Belafonte, Sid Caesar and others. One great moment is Danny Kaye with himself in a barely noticeable split screen doing William Tell and his father in a skit done to the William Tell Overture. Kaye was one of the few television hosts who played to show off his guests rather than himself, and as a result the material is always classic for both.Added to the above are the two selections from The Court Jester: ""the Italian Court,"" and ""The Vessel with the Pestle."" So much fun, so many memories, such an incredible talent. Many might like the last skits, because Danny Kaye is.....Danny Kaye! I really do highly recommend this DVD."
2,Not So Funny,"This can't be the best. Mostly, this is a series of mediocre sketches that go on way too long with no pay-off. Worth having, however, for the Louis Armstrong-Danny Kaye duet of ""When the Saints Go Marching In"" - the exact arrangement they performed in ""The Five Pennies."" The rest of it, however, is forgettable and hardly worth the price. Buy ""The Five Pennies"" instead."
1,non absorbent,This towel does not absorb water...even after washing. Was trying something new after years of using microfiber...lesson learned!
4,Decent hair towel,"I like this hair towel. It's made of a soft, microfiber fabric. I have thick hair and it is pretty absorbent. You can wrap it turban-style or just towel dry your hair in the towel to reduce total blow drying time. I would recommend it."
4,It's ok,"It's not long enough. It doesn't dry as well as other towels that I've tried. That's it. It's very difficult to find a better option, though, so this will need to do for now."
2,Not as good as a T-shirt :(,"The fibers of this towel don't agree with my skin or my hair. When I use it on my hair, it is more frizzy etc. I made my own ""towel"" out of t-shirt material, and it works a lot better than this. If you have straight hair, I think this towel would work well, but curly hair is a different story :)"
1,Waste of money,I like using a plain white men's t-shirt much better. $13 for a 7 pack of t shirts instead of $10 for this horrible towel.
5,Good Product,"I can't say I've had a lot of experience with this kind of product. I have 3A/B curly hair. It's winter, and my hair has been dry. Have been using this instead of a regular towel and it's seemed to make a big difference in how my hair turns out. The towel leaves a lot of the moisture in your hair so the products you use work better. Again, I haven't had experience with other towels of this type, but I imagine that they are all similar. I did have a good experience with this product, and would recommend to others."
3,not what I expected,"I was hoping that this towel would reduce the amount of time required to air dry my hair. I don't use a blow dryer and I hate going out in the winter with wet hair. I was disappointed to find that this towel did not really seem to soak up water any more quickly than a regular bath towel. I'll keep it and continue to use it to wrap my hair in, but it was not the miracle solution I was hoping for."
4,Super soft and absorbent!,"Purchased this micro-fiber towel based on a recommendation from a Yahoo group that I belong to. I have baby locks and needed a towel that is not only absorbent, but wouldn't leave lint in my locks. I've found the towel!!! I simply wrap this towel around my wet locks...and within 15 - 20 minutes all water is absorbed. I love the towel...and the best thing about (it's PINK)!!!"
5,Dry your hair fast without bulky towels!,"I've tried different ones, but this is so much better, and nicer looking if you end up having to leave it on your head (as a turban) than trying to use the wraps that have you twist your hair up with the towel and use a loop and button. My friends and I have ""one of those"" and all of our heads are too big, I guess!"".. or they make them for very small heads!! This one is perfect! Please come out with a VARIETY OF COLORS! Want to buy more!!!"
5,Great towel!,"This and the Aquis hair turban are the first microfiber towels I've tried. I'm very impressed! This 19 x 39 inch towel is way way way more than enough for toweling off after a shower. Plus it dries out very quickly hanging it over the towel bar. True, it's not a towel you can really wrap yourself up in, but it sure will save on space in the washer and dryer! I will definitely be buying more Aquis towels."
4,works well,"This is soft and big enough. I didn't know what to expect, but when I really try to get the water from my hair it works well. It takes less time to dry. My hair is short, but I think it would work much better for long hair because you can wring it dry."
4,Better than my old t-shirt,"Not sure what the previous reviewers meant by the so-called ""bad smell"", but my towel smelled like, well, a towel! It absorbs way more than my old t-shirt that I was using and although these towels aren't large perse, it does do the job of at least absorbing a lot of water. Being a curly girl, this towel is just what I needed. So okay, yeah you can get a ""sham-wow"" towel for about the same price at your local Wal-Mart or CVS, but why? Why use something that's not meant for your hair? I'm just a bit biased. I like the towel and for me it has reduced my diffuser time down. I say, try for yourslf and see!"
2,Smells badly!!,"I ordered the pink towel and I wholeheartedly agree with a previous reviewer about how bad the towel smells when you open the package. It's truly unbearable. I even tried airing out the towel by leaving it on the couch for a day. Didn't work. I might try washing it with loads of detergent, but my boyfriend has a point when he asks if I really want to wrap my head with a towel drenched in chemicals. I might try to return it."
1,Didn't reduce my blowdrying time,"I bought this because it was advertised as reducing blowdrying time. Turns out to be one of those ""if it sounds too good to be true then it probably is"" products. I have shoulder-length hair that is naturally wavy and takes about 15 minutes to blowdry straight after using a regular towel. I used the Mimi's towel and the blowdrying time was (drumroll, please...)15 minutes! So it didn't work for me. On the positive side, it is very lightweight, so I could see how it would be useful if you typically make a turban out of your towel and walk around with it on your head. In that case, it would be much lighter and more comfortable than a regular towel."
1,terrible chemical smell,I just received this Mimi's Diva Dryer by Aquis Microfiber Hair Towel. I opened the container and the towel and container have a VERY strong chemical smell. It is really terrible (you can smell it from feet away!) and nothing I would wrap around my wet hair let alone put near my mouth and nose.The manufacturer should be notified.
2,"Too small, not that absorbent","Not that much more absorbent than my regular terry cloth towels. I also wish it was bigger - not great for someone with long hair. One nice feature, there's a loop on the towel so i can hang it on a hook in the bathroom to dry after using it."
5,history of the number 2 and 3 guys,ned kelly was the jesse james of australia. this is the story of the two guys who worked in his gang--one who betrayed them all.
2,blue windowpane cottom sweater,I purchased two of these after seeing them in a local department store. My son is a North Carolina Fan and the blue was perfect. I was very disappointed. After washing it in cold water....the XXL became a L.....both sweater shrank! VERY DISAPPOINTED! IN THE PURCHASE...WILL NOT BUY CLOTHES FROM YOU AGAIN...BOBBI JO JOHNSON BARNESVILLE OHIO
2,Files missing from CD-ROM,"I bought this book when I was a beginner and read it rather quickly. Today I started work on a telnet client and remembered the book describing the use of telnet URLConnection. Cool, so I loaded the CD-ROM and to my disappointment no protocol handlers (the telnet handler or one for the other example) were included at all. I e-mailed their support person but after a few exchanges it became clear he didn't have a clue."
3,"Good for intermediate JAVA programmer, bad for any other....","I found this a good reference on networking, I/O, RMI, and some threading.... but then again, I had some previous knowledge on each of those topics. Non-the-less, if you would like more information on those topics, I recommend it. Besides those topics, this book doesn't tell you anything useful. Just scratches a surface on Swing...Remember that if you're a beginner or an advanced JAVA programmer, then this book will be completely useless. Trust me! For the amount of money, there're lots of better books around. In fact, you'll find the Official JAVA tutorial on java.sun.com much much better.... and it's free."
1,"Not ""updated for 1.2 as the promo claims""",Authors and editors spent very little time updating is book to Java 2. Its too bad Sybex places such little value on the quality of their books. Sybex is no O'Reilly. Really wish I had not wasted my money on this book.
1,Confusing book,I was reading this book for reference on ChangeListener (page 729). The examples given does not even IMPLEMENT the ChangeListener interface. What a strange way to programing. This is entirely different from LeMay's TY 21 day examples. I am really confused. I am not buying another book by the same authors.
3,"Love the tea, hate the false advertising...","I've always loved this tea, even though it is rather expensive. I purchased it from Amazon because I've never been let down before. Mistake. The tea came in the same box shown in the advertisement, clearly stating ""25 muslin tea bags"". My box had a STICKER over it, which said ""20 muslin tea bags"". I figure if I'm already spending that kind of money on tea, I shouldn't get stuck with a 20% decrease in the product."
2,.99 look,"I bought this item for my younger child. He loves to play with his older brother's professional musician drumsticks. I thought this set will be ideal, but as soon as I opened the package, I was shocked.I have .99c store close to our home and this toy looked like I just got it from that store.I hope I will refund my money."
1,The Fight,"Live and Let Live! Why do so many people fight and criticise other peoples religions or say their religion is better, or the true one? at the end of the day, we will never know if god exists, or what religion is the true one, the only thing we can do, is believe and follow our own faith truthfuly! and hating others for their religion will never lead you to any spritual enlightanment!"
1,worst sounding book EVER,"I read about both of his books and will safely say this guy has his head so far up his butt its back out his own mouth it puts a BIG target on our already strenuous relationship, and its people like him that started the burning times"
1,A terribly biased look at a beautiful earth based religion,"Obviously the author didn't do any direct research into Wicca, or he would have found out right away that true witches do not do dark magic, as they believe in the law of threefold, and that everything one does comes right back to the person doing it. Kind of like what Jesus said about DO UNTO OTHERS. This is clearly a biased right wing Christian author who wants to turn people away from a spiritual tradition that is far less violent than modern Christianity, and that is taking people away from traditional religions in droves because it is a beautiful, earth based tradition that honors women, children and all living things - something Christianity DOES NOT."
1,No research - just pure speculation,"I read this at Barnes & Noble (no purchase necessary). As an agnostic, my interest in ancient and current religions and belief trends never leaves me without something to read. Having researched Wicca and Neo-paganism myself - extensively along with other religions, I can honestly say without a doubt that this man did absolutely NO RESEARCH whatsoever on Wicca. None. Christians and Muslims alike are very quick to cry foul when their religious beliefs are doubted or questioned yet in turn are the first to belittle beliefs different from their own. My advice to anyone christian or otherwise, before you spout off at the mouth - do extensive research on your subject before professing knowledge on it. That does mean reading more than 4 or 5 books on the subject. WHAT A CONCEPT!!!!"
1,Four Words...,Focus on the Family. That should tell you what kind of review this is. It's written by someone who has an obvious anti-Wiccan agenda. What Russo writes about has nothing to do with true witchcraft.
3,Egyptian locket,This is a Christmas gift to coordinate with a hieroglyphic pendant.It's very different and I hope the recipient likes it. It's the perfect gift for this person who's into Egyptian objects
3,One of the worst Dead albums ever.,"Although the first 6 songs or so are pretty good, the rest of the disc is just terrible and features some of the worst songs the Dead ever recorded. However, 2 of the Dead's best songs ever, Shakedown Street and Fire on the Mountain appear on this disc. They are the only real reason anyone would want to get this disc."
2,A low point from a great band,"Anyone who is familiar with the Grateful Dead knows that the real deal is live material. That being said, the Dead did release some great studio titles (Workingman's, American Beauty, Mars Hotel). This, however, is not one of them. In fact, I would say this is the nadir of 1970s era Dead, a period generally acknowledged as their most prolific and accomplished. While some of the material is strong (""Shakedown"", ""Fire""), most of the rest is just plain awful. The execution is competent, but annoyingly garnished with a ""disco"" sheen that is enough to make you either laugh or cringe. Do NOT play this disc to the uninitiated-- they may never get any further!"
2,not essential,"Some tracks only available on this album, but that is hardly sufficent to actually buy it, unless you're a completis"
3,"OK Studio Album, Some of the best tunes at live shows","Although it is a pretty weak studio album, Shakedown Street has quite a few songs that are awesome live. For anyone who loves the dead, it is pretty cool to hear them with this kind of groovy, funky disco sound. Especially Shakedown Street. Jerry sounds grate."
4,Grateful Feat or is it Little Dead,"As a newly appointed 'Deadhead' I have to say that this album was a pleasant suprise. As you can tell from the reviews this is not one of the Dead's most likable albums. Maybe it's the purists that are still praising the material from the 60's and early 70's needlessly maligning this album, but for what ever reason just give it a chance.This album was produced by Lowell George of Little Feat, and his presence is certainly noted here. It has that funky Little Feat feel to it. If your a fan of island/funk/reggae/rock this is the album for you, even if you don't expect it to come from the Grateful dead...."
4,Posing..... and more,"This book contains many very fine pictures. Thers's sufficient variation not only to start with, but to look at time and time again after you progress in this rewarding field of work. Bill has made it a feast for the eyes, you want to turn the page to see the next and next... but you should read also, the text explains, in nice to read language, that although we're on the subject of ""Posing"", it's the combination of surroundings, light, camera angle and (yes !) pose that makes the picture that stands apart. So here's a book that offers more than it says on the cover ! Look, read, learn and enjoy !"
5,Everything you need to know,"I find that this book is interesting for a photographer's mind, tells you clearly how to pose a variety of people, and is in depth enough to keep me coming back for review. I am so happy I ordered this book! Any beginning photographer should buy this and study up!"
5,Posing,"Great book, well written, clear and concise. I learned more from the first 3 chapters than 7 weeks of an instructor lead class I recently took on Portrait Photography."
5,excellent book with usefull information and examples,I'm a beginning/amateur photographer and knew close to nothing about photographing good portraits. After reading this book I'm much more confident and thanks to all the info and examples in the book I have a very good idea on how to make people stand/sit to be able to take a flattering photograph of them.Really worth the money.
4,"Great book for beginning models, and the beginning model photographer","Ok, the title of this review says it all. If you are getting into modeling and/or model photography, this book is great. Provides good information on corrective posing, how to effectively pose just about any body type, and more.Models and photographers who have been doing this for a long time, however, will not really find this book useful."
1,A bunch of photos with a slap-dash attempt at essay,"I received this book today from Amazon and will be returning it tomorrow.The author has assembled some stunning pertraits and surrounded them with a trite attempt at an essay explaining pow to pose people for portraits.Mr. Hurter doesn't carry it off. The portraits are often beautiful, but there is no explanation of how they were acheived. The captions are often ridiculous and read like a museum curator's strained attempt at reading meaning into a canvas of paint drippings.The narrative is ofen just plain silly as when Hurter speaks of image stablization lenses that have very limited application to portraiture. Statements such as ""Most photographers agree that a pleasant, happy expression is considered more desirable than a big smile"" aren't worth paying money for.In sum, the serious student of photographic portraiture will find nothing of value in this book.Jerry"
2,Not very useful,"This book did not meet my expectations. The text and pictures seemed to belong to different books. Hurter writes how a person should not be posed, but most of the images in the book break those rules! I wanted to see pictures that illustrate the text. I would recommendPosing for Portrait Photography: A Head-to-Toe Guideby Jeff Smith instead. The pictures aren't quite as lovely and artistic as the ones in this book, but Smith shows you what he means."
4,Portrait Photographer's Guide to Posing,"This book had wonderful photos and helpful text.However, while the photos were all really great, they tended to be breaking the rules that were being described in the text. As a professional or serious amature photographer one might understand how to follow the rules. However, as a beginning photographer I would really like to see photos that follow the rules being described."
4,Timeless Social Theme,"The only way I can best describe Vulture Culture is that it is user or listener friendly. While not as daring as their 1979 Eve release (with regards to racy lyrics about women and more of a rock sound), it still does not disappoint ! The title track itself carries a somewhat faint resemblance or undertone of intrumentation a la Roxy Music (Avalon, Flesh & Blood). The only track that falters is Hawkeye; it is a sheer 1980's commercial/pop intrumental that could have been used for a sports-shoe product commercial. The catchy title and social concept for this album is perfect; Especially for these times about our existence and where we're going in life on this dog eat dog world of day to day living, commuting, working, etc.,etc...."
4,Days are Numbers is a ballad par none,"I must say that ""Days Are Numbers"" is an incredible ballad. The harmonies (like when they hit 'Some-day' in this song, are just drop dead gorgeous. The lead is soft and perfect, the lyrics hauntingly true to my own life, and this is one of the most played slow songs of my iTunes these days. Call it perfect pop, but it's just a smooth beautiful song in my opinion. Tell me true, if a great friend asked you to slow dance to this song, in a darkened hall with lights above, wouldn't you just go on and on ?"
5,great music for the car,I love this CD and it is on my itunes for the car. Super lyrics and very nice vocals make this one of my favorites.
2,The Item Was Delivered Promptly & Correctly,"I appreciated the quick delivery, however the sound quality is not the best (the volume fades in and out). Regardless, it is still a good item at a good price. I bought 3 CD's and 1 was great, the other 2, not so good and this was one of the 2."
5,THE COVER PHOTO PERSUADED ME TO LISTEN !!!,"This 1983 LP from the ""tell it like it is"" queen of soul Millie Jackson is a often forgotten set from her. She she shines on EVER track. The highlights are the sultry title track,the heartfelt ""Walking in the Rain"" and the naughty firey slow jam ""Slow Tounge"". The cover photo is very attractive and it drew me to listen to this CD and it is very entertanting.I enjoyed every song on this CD. This is one of the most underrated CD's in Millie Jackson's catalogue. Anyone who has "" FEELIN' BITCHY"" or ""FOR MEN ONLY"" among other in their posession,I firmly recommend this album to you as well as ""A MOMENT'S PLEASURE"",""GET IT OUT CHA SYSTEAM"", and her new CD ""NOT FOR CHURCH FOLK"". If you don't have these CD's if you are a r&b /soul lover you don't know what you are missing! SIGNED 17 YEAR OLD MUSIC FAN."
1,Bad,"I have not received the CD. I don't know why, but i hope to receive it before christmas. It was supposed to bea gift."
4,Good Mississppi Gulf Coast Mystery,"Martin Hegwod has written a good Mississippi Gulf Coast Mystery...he just may write a great one next. I was very impressed with this second novel. He is getting better each book.Mr. Hegwood does a fine job of depicting Mississippi Gulf Coast life and culture. Even his physical descriptions of the water routes are accurate. Only a native would be able to describe this in such detail. An earlier review said the book had a Big Easy ambiance, however, this book is Biloxi through and through. Harriet Klausner (#1 reviewer) obviously has never set foot on the Gulf Coast (probably not New Orleans either) or she would have never compared it to Atlantic City. The very idea is inane."
5,Exceptional Presenter is a Great Primer,"The Exceptional Presenter is a great primer for someone who is inexperienced at making presentations. That having been said, it is also a great review tool for those who make presentations on a regular basis and there are bits and pieces for even the experienced presenter. I purchased for my entire training dept."
2,Very used not new as listed,The item was listed as new with a comment that one page was torn. In reality numerous pages were written on and it was very much used.
5,Raise your batting average,"Not only is Koegel's book the perfect ""how-to"" manual for public speakers, Koegel's simple (yet seldom followed) guidelines have been very effective for the sales professionals within my organization. A company may have a great product or service, but they will lose sales unless they can effectively communicate their value proposition. Make every presentation, including marketing presentation count - Koegel's techniques have raised the ""batting average"" of my firm's sales team. This book is a must read for public speakers, managers AND sales professionals."
2,Lightweight,"The author's credentials are impressive. But his advice is familiar and light on details, although he tries to make up for it with interesting stories.His credentials? He's an advertising pitchman who has met Steve Jobs in a boardroom and has horror, and success, stories to tell about pitches with a number of major brands. His street cred is impressive.But his advice is lightweight. Much of this you've heard before. The stuff that's new - his inside secrets - he presents casually and without much detail. For instance, how do you structure a presentation as a story? He uses a careless example that barely looks like a story, then is quickly onto his next point. Very disappointing.The overall impression I have is that this book is not intended to share any of his secrets, but merely to be a 188 page brochure for his consulting services. Are there a few useful nuggets? Yes, there are. Are his stories entertaining? Absolutely. But he keeps his best secrets to himself."
3,Sound advice for improving your presentations ...,"Pro's* Compact, succinct and easy to read* Very practical* Stresses the importance of PRACTICE to get better* Many useful forms that can help you self-assess your speaking strengths and weaknesses* Good perspective on seeing everyday exchanges with others as ""mini-presentations"" in themselvesCon's* Not much here that has not been said before* Title may over-sell the book a bitIf your job or personal role involves public speaking, time invested in reading this book will be well-spent."
2,Beginners only,I found the book to be valuable for a beginner but not for the more advanced speaker/presenter. Good points were made but I found little new information that I haven't already encountered in other books.
4,The Exceptional Presenter,"Excellent, easy read identifying the relevant points that a presenter or would be presenter should master and practice. Time well spent."
5,"""A Must Read""",Many of the short stories leave you with wanting to read more!The poetry is easy to read for a novice and to ponder.
5,"Excellent quality, great music","The CD was in fine shape, I's say mint condition. Love Amy & Leslie, they are local to me. Wish I could find copies of their earlier cassettes (never released to CD, and Alcazar Records is OOB now). This album retains the charm of the earlier music, while polishing it up and smoothing out the rough edges. But, I liked the rough edges...thus looking for the other albums, Earthsong & Flying on the Wings of Heaven.If you like harmonious duets, these women are fabulous! Now that they have broken up, their separate careers are worth looking for as well, and they each have gone on to make other albums both solo and with other artists. They occasionally perform as Amy & Leslie, though, for which I am glad. This album is great!"
5,"""COMIC RELIEF ""","WHAT CAN I ADD TOO THIS MARVELOUS SHOW THAT RAN FOR 9 SEASONS PRIME TIME?I HAVE ENJOYED THIS COMEDY RELIEF AS IT RELATES SO CLOSELY TO THE REAL THING,THE AMERICAN DREAM.IT CAME AT ADECENT PRICE FROM AMAZON.COM AND QUICK SERVICE."
5,Love them!,Love this show and wanted to have the collection so I could watch them whenever I want - great value.
2,Mediocre .... at best.,"As an avid APP fan, I was rather disappointed with the quality of this album. The lyrics fit very well in the theme of the album but the music sounds extremely amateurish. I know at the time that AP had a contract with Arista records to release three albums in a short period of time...and that there was another album ""Sicilian Defense"" that was so bad that Arista kept it in their vaults and vowed never to release it...and true to their word, that's exactly what they did. Eve was one of those three quick albums, Pyramid and Turn of a Friendly Card,which were fabulous albums, were the other two. Eve was rushed, the musicianship very amateurish and overall the album left this APP fan very unimpressed.Lucifer was a great instrumental....but outside of that and If I Could Change Your Mind, the music here is not of great quality. If I were to introduce someone to APP, I would not play this album...in fact, this would be the LAST album I would allow them to hear."
4,"Eh,it's Okay","I like this CD,But it scares me alot when I listen to Lucifer:I kinda think there's a Ghost at my back.The Rest is cool."
2,Needlessly misogynistic and without pop appeal,"If you're a man on the rebound after a disastrous love affair, this album might be for you. For anyone else though -- not so much. Because I'm an APP fan I have the album, but I can't really recommend it.*The misogyny in this album is unsubtle and juvenile, starting with the album cover itself. ""Lie Down With Dogs"" is probably the nadir of Alan Parson's career. It's the ""Sicilian Defense"" that made it out of MCI's vault.The album is only partially redeemed by ""Winding Me Up"" and ""You Won't Be There."" It's too bad everything else has to drag those songs down.* I could even recommend ""Keats"" and ""Freudiana"" and the soundtrack from ""LadyHawke"" before this dreck."
2,Jutting wedge,"Why did I go on an Alan Parsons spree? Aside from the cohesively agreeable I Robot and occasional inspired tracks, these time-stamped packaged deals can play like unworthy emulations of brighter influences."
4,Almost reached 5 stars,"I have always been an APP fan since I was 15. When I was a teen, this album seemed boring. The only songs I liked back then were "" Damned if I Do"" and ""Winding me Up"". I'm 33 now, and my perception of this album has turned 180 degrees. First of all it's the only album APP made that has female lead vocals, as far as I know. Second, The songs are full of meaning and emotion that as a teen I couldn't see. Most of the songs are well orchestrated and pleasing. Yes I am male, and this album wouldn't be allowed on store shelfs from feminists today; but the honost emotions and experiences of the writers appear to come out in the songs. For 5 star APP works try ""I Robot"" or ""Eye in the Sky"". This album is a noteworthy work to purchase, however."
1,what a rip-off,"this isn't the cd of alan parsons project, i opened it up thinking that i can't wait to hear these songs and rut roe that wasn't even the one that i ordered never even lifted the disc off of the tray to play it and they would'nt even take it back OR even let me due an even exchange it,so i just took my loses and gave it to my local library and didn't even look back as the boston song goes,next tyme i better exame it a little more closely b.4. the rapper comes off..."
4,This one is a sleeper,"This is not an album that attracted a lot of positive attention when it came out, but I bought it anyway because it's APP (one of the few groups I ever bought without previewing). While the first few times through you may not be too impressed, try listening to it at least 5-10 times and it will really grow on you. While the album has obvious weaknesses, it has a lot to offer -- different things to different people, and the earlier ""APP sound"" comes through. I like ""Winding me up"" and other tracks quite a bit -- vocals and instrumentals alike.Give it a try and decide how amused/outraged/entertained you are."
5,Great album!,"I had never listened to this older APP album when I was young, but am glad that I did now. It has some really creative stuff on it and I listen to it a lot."
3,"""You're scratchin' an itch....""","Frankly, I wish Parsons and Woolfson had done some other kind of concept album. After the first three I heard this one in '79 and was disappointed. A lot of the songs sound good and I got to where I liked them. ""You won't be there"" is a good one and ""If I could change your mind"". Was this album their rebuttal in the face of rejection or what? Anyway, I finally realized that this album was just ""different"" than the first three and it gradually ""grew"" on me. However, I hardly ever listen to this CD now. I was getting into Parsons ""other place and time"" kind of sound. When I heard this everything crashed back to harsh reality. Actually I would give this album a higher rating but somehow it seemed out of order. There are good songs on this album though, don't pass it up if you're a Parsons/Woolfson fan. Its got ""Vulture Culture"" beat bad, that's for sure."
2,More I hate you and you hate me more,"An album necessary if you are a completist, but the album draws too strongly on the negative aspects of relationships. The theme tires."
4,"Fast tire, looks good on my cruisers.","I like the classic tread pattern and minimal contact patch with the pavement. The profile is much like my other ""knobbies"" were, so they look good in the fenders. The whitewall version is also cool. There is no audible buzz or hum and rolling resistance is a bit less. Satisfied."
5,A Special Tribute to Sir Andrew Davis,"This 2000 version of Last Night at the Proms pays a special tribute to Sir Andrew Davis, who held the role of conductor of the BBC Symphony & Orchestra from 1988 to 2000.As a frequent visitor to Great Britain, I have watched the BBC broadcast of previous years of the Last Night of the Proms, and found myself very much a part of the celebrations of British Heritage!Watching the 2000 version on this DVD was no exception, it is wonderful having the option of playing the individual tracks such as Land of Hope and Glory, Rule Britannia and Jerusalem! Another option the DVD allows is to watch the full program with or without some limited commentary.Enjoy!!"
5,A delight...,"What's not to like about the record of the final Proms concert of the 2000 season? (if you've never heard of the Proms, or want to know a bit of the background of the series, take a peek here:[...] )In addition to the festive atmosphere normal to this annual event, conductor Sir Andrew Davis was standing down from the BBC Symphony to take up a post in the US...which only boosted the spirits of the audience as they said a fond farewell. If you've never actually seen a Proms broadcast (much less attended any of the concerts), this disc is a wonderful introduction to this grand annual ritual. Highly recommended for any collection."
5,"Tabaran - Not Drowning, Waving","the BEST work by an extremely under-rated Ozzie 'world' band of late 80's-early 90's. Tabaran captures NDW's amazing Australian landscape sounds with Papuan/Melanesian influences. INCREDIBLE disc & timeless...even Peter Gaberiel likes 'em!'Do yourself a favour'SSBrisbane, Oz"
5,"A wonderfully, quirky . . .",". . . addition to the VeggieTales family.Nope -- this one is not a Bible story or a classic tale humorously re-told. It's just fun! With Mr. Lunt (the ""techo-gourd of the future"") running a random song generator (Pa Grape singing about Biblical Dwarves or Archibald Asparagus singing about Military Intelligence) and two silly robots attempting vaudeville -- this VeggieTales video is not what you would expect.But my family sure has gotten a kick out of it -- from the babies, up to the teens (and, frankly, the adults).All KINDS of fun!Highly Recommended!"
2,Not as good as some of the others.,I was a bit disappointed with this episode. It is just several music videos with Bob and Larry as M.C.'s presenting the videos. Kids may like it though.
1,Disappointing,"This was awful. My baby boy loves Veggie Tales! When I turned this on, he paid rapt attention...until two minutes in when Larry was still doing his ""chicken head"" antics. Kid was bored! The concept was o-kay...but it was so bizarre. No storyline to follow. The songs were okay but the silly songs with Larry from other episodes are much better. It's tough for a small child to grasp the concept and, even though I get it, I still didn't think it was funny. Kinda lame. A rare miss for Veggie Tales. I'm going to take it back and exchange it for a better DVD."
5,"Quirky, odd..but cute","Bob ""Wow, the future sure is white""Larry ""Yeah, the future has been white since the 70's""The above dialoge is the funniest joke on the whole video. Ok, it sounds cuter when the veggies do it.By far this is not the best of Veggie Tales nor is it the norm. Nonetheless, it really does not deserve some of the bad reviews. No, it is not a Bible story, it is a hodge podge of story lines & songs (most with cute lyrics that most younger kids will enjoy or like me relive your childhood). But that is the point. Our daily lives are a hodge podge most days. Things go rarely as we plan, but at the end of the day, God still loves us.Veggie fans will want this in their library. If you are new to the Veggie Tales world, try some other videos first; Snoodle's Tale, Minnesota Cuke, Lord of the Beans, etc."
1,Love VeggieTales...Hate this One,"This was definitely the worst VeggieTales movie I've ever seen (and I've seen most of them). It wasn't like any of the other episodes/movies which would have been okay if it was enjoyable, but it was just plain weird. I couldn't watch it with my daughter as it jumped around a lot. I probably only got 1/2 way through it, but if this one had the usual VeggieTales lesson, it must have not come up until the end because everything I saw was random, disjointed, and not really funny. I never understand why people who have a great idea and a good format feel like they have to change it."
2,"Sigh, I could make a video more entertaining","I love VeggieTales; so I was shocked when I saw this one. Somewhat boring & very chaotic, I'd have taken it back if I could. OK, little kids will look at the TV for a while when anything is on, and esp something this ""busy"". However, I really think I could make a funnier home video. I like ALL the other VeggieTales including the Larry Boy cartoons! This one was just junk. :("
4,This One Is Fun!,"This is a pretty fun video! I absolutley LOVED,""Hole in the Bottom of the Sea""!( I liked that there was a pic of Jonah) The jokes were definetley not as funny--thats why i'm giving it 4 stars ( I was hoping for an appearence by Khalil). ""My Day"" was SO CUTE! I don't know why people are so mad because it's different- like another reveiwer said, they can't do da same thing every time! the shorts were funny--I liked da opera singer better. About it being different, I noticed that happened with ""Esther"". People got all sore because it wasn't ""normal"" And I don't think that's FAIR!"
2,"VT ""Concept"" Video?","They must have come up against a creative wall to put this one out. Although my 5 y.o. likes to watch it occasionally, it usually sits on the shelf. There's not really a story or plot, it's supposed to be the future of entertainment - randomly selected by computers. The jokes aren't funny, although they're not really supposed to be, there are a few cute songs, but there's no message, no plot, no point really."
2,Pretty darn weird,"This is the strangest VeggieTales episode out there. There is virtually nothing that could be considered a plot, the concept is bizarre, and the whole thing comes across as being plain ol' weird. It seems like this was an excuse to showcase songs, and that the whole ""animation"" and ""storyline"" parts were afterthoughts. That this video is ""autotainment"" can't really be argued with, but I would really take issue with the ""wonderful"" part...thank goodness most VeggieTales episodes are nothing like this one."
1,Not that great....,I love most of the Veggie Tales.....but I did not like this one very much at all. It didn't keep my granddaughters attention either. This was not one of their best efforts...I was disappointed.
5,Why so overlooked??,"This is one of my favorite Bill Staines albums! Every song getsstuck in my head. Don't be turned off by the drab cover work sounbecoming of most Folk Legacy LP's. Not a bad song on the list.If you like Bill and other folkies like Lightfoot ect., buy thisand be happy!"
5,The Twins' shine on their breakthrough U.S. album,"Compared to previous works, the Thompson Twins' ""Into the Gap"" shows a musical maturity that was not displayed in the past... and they were rewarded with their first (and only) U.S. Top 10 album.Alannah Currie's lyrics move from delightfully dippy to heart-warming romanticism, especially on tracks like ""Hold Me Now"" (their biggest U.S. hit) and ""Storm on The Sea"". The Twins have also been able to concoct the bounciest hooks & melodies, textured with layers of keyboards -- like the Arabian chant-induced magic carpet ride of ""The Gap"", the upbeat & positive harmonica-ridden spin of ""You Take Me Up"", the sacrifices and punishment of an abused wife in ""Sister of Mercy"", and the emotional co-dependence of ""Doctor! Doctor!"".Definitely one of the best all-original albums in the Twins' catalog... and one of the only not out-of-print. Check it out, you'll understand why..."
5,Also try this...,"This revue is mistakenly applied to ""Into The Gap"" when it should be a review of ""Quick Steps and Side Kicks"".An 80's defining album! This is core-80's. This is 80's-101. This album IS the 80's for me.If you like this album, definately you should also check out ""ABC"" and especially, their album ""The Lexicon of Love."" It contains their hit ""The Look of Love"" which you will recognize right away if you are a Twins fan."
2,Dated And Uncool,The Thompson Twins made mediocre synth pop in a time when that was really cooool. Now they just sound dated. Valuable for nostalgia only.
4,FINALLY!,"It's about time the Thonpson Twind join the frey and re-release all the old albums with b-sides and such, been a long time overdue! It's so wonderful to hear all these old tunes and some that ive never heard before!"
3,Fall Into The Gap,"Into The Gap was the Thompson Twins third album released in the US (fifth overall) and their most popular. It peaked at number 10 and produced their most popular hit ""Hold Me Now"" which peaked at number 3 in mid 1984. The song has a memorable bass line and a fun, sing along chorus. ""Doctor, Doctor"" barely missed the top ten peaking at number 11 and was more of a ""harder"" song with a popping synth riff and clicking maracas. ""You Take Me Up"" has deep south hymnal vibe and is a forgotten gem from the band."
5,Today is the First Day of the Rest of your Life!,"What a wonderful inspiring book that lifts up and encourages those who feel like it might be too late to make a difference or to change their life. Marden assures us that it is never too late and gives wise instructions and guidelines on how to reverse their destiny, let go of the past, and begin anew. A True Treasure!"
1,BOOOOOOOORING..........,This book was so boring. I couldn't even understand what it was saying. They found a stupid cat. They wanted to keep it and that is wierd!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,security on a budget,"The swivel is designed so that it cannot rotate, making it easier than most key holders to attach/detach keys with one hand. With a little practice, it can be done quickly, one handed, without looking. The swivel is plastic, so not sure how it will hold up, but so far so good. Strap may be a little larger than some key holders from the hardware store, but it fits well and looks good on a duty belt or most fairly good sized mens belts. I would buy again without hesitation."
2,This Cat's one stellar track,"Maybe it's how it evokes vivid memories of my own coming of age in 1976 but Stewarts ""Year of the Cat"" (the song not the record) is worth the price of the disk. It's always mezermized me, from the opening piano intro to the nylon and elctric guitar solos split in half by that high-proud sax, then and now whenever I hear it. It is quite simply, one of the most hauntingly, effortlessly flowing and perfect pieces of music I've ever heard. Track nine surly is his master opus and his finest year."
2,"2 great songs, 2 mediocre ones and a bunch of filler","Al Stewart can write great songs and he can write really bad ones. Just what the heck is this Lord Grenville? A song about a loser English nobleman. I didn't know whether to give this album 2 or 3 stars, but decided on 2 because this is such a bad way to start out a CD. The two great songs are the two hits (which is unusual. Radio stations typically make hits out of the weaker material). There are two songs that have a nice social commentary (Midas Shadow and Broadway Hotel) but don't have the music to back them up. One Stage Before is an OK song, but the remainder are pointless stories with sappy melodies. For rabid Al Stewart fans, this is probably his best album. For everyone else, there are other Al Stewart albums that have a higher per centage of great songs and a lower per centage of filler."
4,Let It Purr....,"This was one of the first cassettes in my collection back in the 70's, and receiving the CD for Christmas was one of the best presents I could have gotten. It's a funny thing: there's nothing groundbreaking in the music or production, and yet it gets in your psyche, curls up in a corner that becomes its own, and becomes part of yourself you wondered how you ever lived without -- which is how cat owners often describe their pets. Another incredible mastering job by Rhino. Also: I used to think of this as Al's ""Spanish"" album, not because of the song styles, but because he manages to use the word ""Spanish"" in the first three songs on the disc, even though they're all very different from one another. Who else could pull that off?"
4,Only 4 stars because the EMI version is better,"This is one of Alan Parsons' best producing jobs, and that's saying a lot. The wonderful sound combined with solid folk rock songwriting and very talented bandmembers make this one of the best recordings of the 70s, PERIOD. MFSL, the audiophile label, chose this as their 9th release.The EMI version currently available has better sound plus 3 bonus cuts. The bonus cuts aren't terribly important unless you're a fan, but the sound makes a big difference."
5,One of the Best,"The CD came as discribed, in a new lift lock case, the booklet is in great shape, and the CD looked, and play wonderful. I have been to Rockaway, and it great to know they still stock the rarities."
5,"Read It, Draw It, Solve It","I have purchased another read It, Draw It, Solve It before for 1 and 2 grade. It can be used in a workstation or as homework or morning work. I use it for my second grade children that are above level or on level. It provides problem solving and higher level thinking."
3,Read it workbook review,"I was excited when I bought the book, but was a bit disappointed when it arrived. It doesn't seem to be challenging enough for what I want to teach in math. It might work as a filler when having a substitute. It's well written but not challenging enough."
4,Craftsmanship...,"...that's what's missing in so much mass-market pop music these days.Well here's an antidote. This album is rich with superb craftsmanship - elegant harmonies, real instruments (acoustic guitars, fiddles, accordions), lovely songs that whilst recently written have a timeless quality.Oh, and let's not forget the return of a great voice. After a long silence (literally) Linda Thompson has returned and she has lost nothing as a singer and reveals herself here as a fine composer."
3,Unbiased review - TOO EXPENSIVE,"I've used this product for a couple of months and it does a good job, butnothing stellar. It is better than anything you would find at Walmart orthe supermarket (i.e. Gillete, Colgage, etc) but not too different from a some shaving cream formulas from Kiehls or Art of Shaving. Believe me, i've tried a bunch of shaving creams and gels and this product TOO EXPENSIVE.A better bet would be Kiehls shaving formulas which work well to improve my razor bumps and last a lot longer.I give it 3 stars because of price and also because 1/2 the reviews to date 5/10/08, have come from the South Florida area. Mens Science is also based in South Florida. Coincidence - perhaps, but I'm always a skeptic of a small number of reviews.Herbman"
1,I just found this sad,"I've always loved the Smothers Brothers - they were so gifted, so funny. But like so many show business people, they fooled themselves into thinking they were more important, more informed, and had greater insight into life than everyone else.What is it about a singer or comedian or actor that makes them think they have a firmer grasp of politics or foreign policy than those who have spent their lives studying and working in the field?This show just highlights that sort of egotistical celebrity folly - they sacrificed their sweet funny comedy act so that their political opinions could be heard - and all it accomplished was to make sure we didn't get to hear their funny comedy OR their political opinions!Why don't more entertainers just listen to Laura Ingrahm when she says -""Shut Up and Sing!"" ?I quit watching the TV show when they got political and this program reminds me why I did."
4,Not bad. but.....,"This gives a good overview of the story of the Smothers Bros. late 1960s show and why and how it got cancelled. Those who are familiar with the basic story behind this may learn of some new things, such as the fact that LBJ himself watched and disliked the show (you' figure he had other things to worry about like Vietnam and Civil Rights) and of the Smothers successful lawsuit against CBS.There are a few clips of the skits and on-air sermonizing that got the show in hot water, but very few. Joan Baez's speaking on her imprisoned husband, the hippy commentator's drug references, Harry Belafonte singing ""Carnival"" to footage of the 1968 Chicago riots (it's never clear if that footage actually aired), and Pete Seeger singing ""Waist Deep in the Big Muddy and the Big Fool Says to Push On"" and a snippet of David Steinberg's biblical parodies are about it. The other stuff is just talked about.More clips would help, as well as an extra of an actual episode."
3,History Lesson,I wished there would be DVDs with highlights from their shows to enjoy their talents.The censorship struggles are interessted but who wants to see it more than once.
1,thumbs down,"Smothered - The Great Smothers Brothers Censorship Wars [VHS]Boring,no good clips of shows. My parents loved the show, and I gave this to them as a gift. They threw it away!"
1,Smothers Brothers Censored,"I was very disappointed in this DVD, it was mostly documentary and not enough of the Smothers Brothers performances."
1,Still have not received the item!!!!!!,The products that were purchased ( Dec.12) for Christmas presents have not been received. There lies the review.
3,No bonus features,"Sellers page and dvd case stated dvd contained bonus feature there were none. Just the main movie, which was good just would have been nice to have the bonus features that were missing."
5,Wiggles Safari,"What a fun movie to watch for my 2yr. old and myself. Great music and with Steve Erwin, it's funny too. Good educational tool with Austraila's wildlife animals.Wiggles foreverJ and A"
4,Fun,"The Wiggle's and Steve Irwin, what more could you ask for? My son didn't like it at three but now that he's a little closer to four he gets into learning about the animals. Definately better for the four to five year old set."
3,"Wiggles fans will love this, but...","There's no doubting the appeal of the Wiggles. Five wholesome young men, some catchy pop tunes and dancing easy enough for kids to join in. But there's something missing. Perhaps it's the charmless supporting cast of characters (do we really need another synthetic dinosaur on children's TV?) or the fairly clueless lyrics of their songs or just the plain hammy acting. Don't get me wrong. This video will appeal to the 2-5 age group. But if you want to expose your children to good music, crafted lyrics, witty professionalism and something with educational value, look again at Sesame Street."
1,Wiggly Safari,"Not Up to Wiggle Standards.First of all, it seems to myself and 3 year old that the Wiggles were tired and did not feel like dancing or using their usually creative interpretations to their music. The too energentic teenagers were sooooo annoying (nobody can be that happy)they just seemed not be part of the Wiggles. Steve Irwin was the only breath of fresh air in this obviously 1 day to film Video. I really hope the next video that The Wiggles will be in top form (dancing, singing, having young children in the video)."
2,Wiggles are great - just not in this video,"I seldom write reviews (although I often read them), but I wanted to warn other parents out there before they purchase this video. My 19 month old son adores the Wiggles and adores animals so I thought this would be a great video. However, the songs are not very good and the coreography is terrible. The worst part is the editing. The video makes rapid cuts during the songs - never staying on the same image for more than 5-10 seconds - making you feel a little queasy watching it. Unlike other videos, kids can't copy the moves and dance along since the rapid cuts prevent them from following the coreography. I also think it is overstimulating for a young child to watch."
2,wiggly Safari,I didn't really enjoy this DVD. My son was near as entertained by this movie as other Wiggles movies. The animals were nice but not enough focus was on the animals to make this DVD different and interesting.
2,Suitable for Older Kids?,"With great anticipation, we popped the new video in, and in less than 5-minutes, my 20-month old son wandered off. This new video is probably aimed at an older audience. The music is slower with less of a beat, and there's not much dancing at all. If you have a younger child, I suggest buying Wiggly, Wiggly World, Hoop-De-Doo, or Wiggle *Play* Time."
5,Another wiggly crowd pleaser in this house,"My 16 mos old son loves this one as much as he loves Toot toot, wiggle time, and Yummy yummy. This one is edited differently and is set in The Australian zoo with Steve Irwin. My son doesnt dance as much this one but just giggles and bops along. It is an entertaining dvd that can get my little one to pay attention throughout entire video"
5,A BIG WIGGLY SAFARI ADVENTURE.,"The Wiggles & their friends join Steve Irwin, his wife Terri and their daughter, Bindi for lots of exciting animal adventures at the Australia Zoo. Captain Feathersword learns how to speak cockatoo from ""The Croccodile Hunter"", Wags the Dog does the ""Dingo Tango"", and Dorothy dances the butterfly ballet with young girls in ""Butterflies Flit"". The Wiggles: Wiggly Safari was my first Wiggles DVD that was first ever made in (2002)."
2,wiggly safari,"It was not as engaging as the others. I figured since it had real animals, Steve Irwin and live-action scenes, it would be really good too. But the whole DVD doesn't have that special quality that say Yummy Yummy has or Wiggly Time or Big Red Car have."
2,"Boy, were we disappointed!","My daughter and I are both huge Wiggles fans, but I found this tape to be not up to their usual standard, and she found it rather boring (she's 22 months old). Not even getting into the *10 minutes* of commercials in the beginning of the tape, none of their ""hits"" were on the tape. The music wasn't up to their usual standard. The whole thing took place in the Australian Zoo, which was sort of cool, but just didn't do it for us. Different is always a risk, but I don't think this worked for them. The only reason I gave it two stars is because we still love the Wiggles! I hope their next release is more like their traditional releases, though."
1,Awful!,This DVD is boring and annoying. It won't catch the attention of my child and the songs get on my last nerve. Even the performers seem bored to me.
2,Yuck!,"My kids like it cause they like Steve Irwin but I don't really. Really cheesy... too cutsy.. really a piece of publicity for Irwin's Australia Zoo.... This video doesn't have the quality ofsongs, script, etc. of the other recent Wiggles Video.. it is like going back to the days of ""Dance Party"". Worst part if the koola interview with Jeff-- it is Terri who is really too cutsy.. Also way too much of Bindi (Irwin's daughter)... I give it too stars because my boys really like Irwin but I personally would send it back"
2,Not their best movie,"My son LOVES The Wiggles, but HATED this movie. It did not keep his attention at all."
1,Huge dissapointment!,"My daughter loves the Wiggles. But this video was far to advanced for my 22 month old. She can't follow a single move and I know it dissapoints her. Though she may like some of the songs and seeing the animals between the songs, the moves are beyond her. And there is at least one part where she comes running to me in fear. I think the was a poor thought out show and I'm sorry I purchased it."
5,Wiggles' Fans Will L-O-V-E Love It!,"My son 4-1/2 and daughter 2 love this one. With the addition of Steve Irwin ""The Croc Hunter"", they cannot get enough. They were already Wiggles' fans but this one really has them dancing."
3,"Not a favorite, and our two year old LOVES the Wiggles","Our two year old LOVES the Wiggles tv shows & would listen to his ""Yummy Yummy"" CD ALL DAY, EVERY DAY if we let him, but this DVD does not hold his attention in the same way. I also find it significantly less tolerable for me to sit through (truth be told, these weird Australians have grown on me).It is, however, 1000 times better than the 'Yummy Yummy' DVD (2002)(not to be confused with the audio cd of same title)."
3,Not quite as popular as the other Wiggles videos...,"My 9 month old daughter has sat spellbound by the Wiggles since she was about 10 weeks old. If we ever needed her to sit in one place for an hour, forget about teething pain or other boo-boos, all we've ever had to do was pop on a Wiggles DVD and all is forgotten...except with this particular DVD.I don't know if she's a bit baffled with the Crocodile Hunter popping up every 2 seconds (I can tell she's thinking, ""Who IS this guy?!""). Or perhaps she doesn't like it as much because all of the songs and skits take place outdoors and there aren't any brightly colored studio sets.She watches it, but she's not as interested in this one as her other Wiggles DVDs. ""Woo-Hoo Wiggly Grimlins"" and ""Top of the Tots"" are by far her favorites."
4,Great kids video,"My three-year-old and my almost-five-year-old really enjoy this video. They love learning about animals and they love the Wiggles. The songs are great, and they have really learned a lot about different animals in Austrailia. Great purchase."
2,Not very fun,"Unless your kid is a crocodile hunter fan, skip this DVD. There is too much ""plot"", and the songs are lame. My 2yr old asked for ""other wiggy"" DVD, so even she was bored."
4,The Wiggles and Travelin Tyke,"What a phenom the Wiggles have become! Both my children watch the Wiggles before and after school and they just can't get enough of them. Captain feathersword and wags the dog are my favorite, but this show just proves that money does not make a good show.... creativity makes a good show! ...[website]"
4,"Good, but could be better...","Our family loves the wiggles, but this is not one of their better ones. Not really what we expected, we thought there would be more animals, more of Steve Irwin and the Wiggles with the animals. The songs are new but not their best."
2,"Not good, the only poor wiggles performance","I should have listened to the negative reviews on this one; I have many of the other wiggles series and my kids can't get enough of them for years. BUT the wiggly safari was such a failure - my boys watched it once and were so bored and don't want to see it again. The wiggly safari is poorly made, poor graphics, boring songs, nothing interesting about it. I'm sorry to say it was a waste of my money."
2,A bit too hyper!,"We started with the Yummy-Yummy video by the Wiggles and our 16-month son loves it, as do we! It is great because the songs are great--simple lyrics and choreography that make it very interactive for all of us. Wiggly Safari is the second video we've purchased. In general, it is much more complicated and too active for all of us. It has been thoroughly ""Hollywoodized"": many more camera angles, more complicated and faster choreography, young child dancers replaced by Mickey-Mouse club 20-yr olds, etc... Our son became frightened by some of the overly hyper scenes. My biggest gripe is the frequent scene changes during songs (often a new frame every 1-3 seconds!!)--it makes me dizzy and surely can't be good for kids. There are a few songs that are more calm, and our son does enjoy many of the animals, but we intend to store this one away until he's quite a bit older, in hopes that he won't end up with ADD."
2,Maybe for older wiggles fans?,"My son was an offical wiggles addict and we watched Toot Toot until the tape wore out, however, he never got into this video. My thought is that it was over his head. It was not the same as the other video, it jumped around a lot and there was not as much singing and dancing as the other videos. I am going to pull it back out now that he is a bit older. I would just be cautious with this video, it didn't go over well with my son, but worth a try again!"
5,The Wiggles and The Croc Hunter together? GREAT!!,Who ever thought to put these two great Aussie phenomenomes together needs to be patted on the back and be put on a pedestal! Great video defenitly recommend it!!
1,Poor execution,"Great concept, but too much of that Irwin guy who is a bit agressive and loud, and too much technical intervention with the editing. My son (3 yrs) likes the Wiggles, but this one just overloads him and he wanders off to get a book. This DVD is going in the next yard sale."
3,The Second best Wiggles video so far BUT......,"The best Wiggles video we own is the Hoop-de-do Party.This one is the second best.The Wiggles team up w/ Steve Irwin aka The Crocodile Hunter to spotlight animals native to Australia. Unfortunatley, they spend more time on themselves and the dancers rather than the animals. During the song about the emus, not ONE REAL EMU was shown. Nor were any owls shown during that song - they showed concert footage. There were no kangaroos, and only a few crocodiles (When Steve Irwin is introduced at the beginning, he says to Murray, ""My crocodiles would love a good seranade""...OK so where are the crocodiles, mate?)I wish the creative team would spotlight The Wiggles less (yes I know its their video)and the animals more. It would have been a great intro to Austrailian wildlife turns out only to be so-so.On the other hand, this video has more life than most Wiggle videos. It happens to be my daughter's favorite..and i have to admit mine too.So Wiggle on..."
4,Not too bad,"My son loves the Wiggles and watches them every day on Disney. So I bought him this DVD. Being that he had never heard the songs before he wasnt too impressed. It took a few weeks for him to like it. Over all - if your child loves the Wiggles and you as a parent are looking for a good, wholesome, educational movie for your child - the Wiggles are the way to go. I have watched one too many comedies that have hidden violence and adult undertones that my son does not understand YET - but I DO!! I have watched many an hour of their shows and the Wiggles are great!"
4,Grows on you,"We bought this video when it first came out & our son wouldn't watch more than 2 minutes of it before insisting it be taken out. Now that he's older (almost 2), he wants to watch this one multiple times per day! It doesn't have as much singing & dancing as the earlier videos, but it's his new favorite. When he picks it out now, we're saying ""not again."" My suggestion is: Don't rule out this video if your child doesn't love it at first, give it time & it'll grow on you."
3,The Wiggles Have Done Better,"My children are BIG Wiggles fans and I have enjoyed them as a kids show. I am not usually critical of the Wiggles, but I feel like the songs are NOT all that great. I usually love their songs and sing them with my 2 and 3 year old daughters regularly. We own quite a few of their DVDs. The filming is very choppy and doesn't let the kids focus too much on the fun wildlife in the Australian Bush. My kids are fine with it, but I was unimpressed--and I am usually impressed with all things Wiggles. If you don't own any Wiggles DVDs, DO NOT start with this one. ""Yummy Yummy"" and ""Toot Toot"" have much better kids songs with fun actions. It was fun watching Steve Erwin with his wife and daughter on the show--he has a lot of charisma. The Wiggles are the same fun guys as always--I just felt the songs and filming were pretty poor."
4,A Fine Entry in the Wiggly World,"With a 2 year old daughter to chase around, the Wiggles have become a mainstay in my home. They are a perfect distraction for my daughter when I have work that has to be done. What makes this video so good is that it introduces American children to some of Australia's unique wildlife. The Wiggles sing simple songs about koalas, dophins, cuckaburros(forgive the spelling), and even a song about snakes that warns ""look, but you better not touch."" (Crocodile Hunter)Steve Irwin's energy is a perfect addition to the fray. He explains simple things about the animals without going into too much detail for young minds. Of course, it's the songs that really hold my daughter's attention. Although she can't speak very well right now, she does manage to get a lot of the words to the songs right. Most of the songs are very good, although a couple of them seem to drag a little bit compared to others. Overall, this is a good video, and I highly recommend it."
5,EUREKA!! El Supremo!!,"This is the hardest book i've ever tackled and the finest introduction to Early Greek thought that i have ever seen! The Late Werner Jaeger also produced a great gift to students of the Ancients with his superb 3 volumes entitled Paideia: The Ideals of Greek Culture [Paideia is Greek for Culture, Education, Civilization] but this seemingly small volume even surpasses his Magnum Opus in brilliance!..."
5,Smell of the Tree - Awesome,"You will not be disappointed. I use it ""YEAR AROUND"" in my office -- people are always asking me about the wonderful smell as soon as they walk in the door."
2,so so,I thought the scent was very weak. Maybe strong enough in a very small office or room but not for a living room.
3,Immature,"But a nice easy fun read.There's little new here .. except for the premise that things are backward. Once that concept is understood there is nothing original left.Anti-hero becomes super-hero, miraculously escapes all sorts of impossible situations, gets beautiful princess ,, single-handedly diverts a war .. discovers the history of the world, quite unexpectedly at the end .. etc."
4,Parallel multiple worlds,"The text had a mess of irritating typos, but the adventure was clear and crisp, the description and characterizations were good.The idea of different parallel universes with possibly different physical laws works. This sort of adventure could be made into an alternate universe""zievatronics"" series. The political blindsiding in the physics world in the first part is a reality and probably worse since the cold war ended.Bush's reinvention of war for the Military -Industrial complex hasn't improved the politics. In the future, as nice as the USA is to live in, there may be a brain drain to Europe where they fund new research?Civilization may really be a matter of ""practice""?"
3,"Immature, but amusing","This is certainly not Brin's best novel, and he clearly still had a lot to learn in his craft when he wrote it. However, it is based on an interesting concept and is entertaining enough to keep the reader amused."
3,Escapist fun,A Connecticut Yankee in king Arthur's court meets John Carter from mars. Fun read I would have liked to spend more time in this world.
2,The book could use practice...,"This book was written, clearly, before David Brin had ""practiced"" his writing skills to full effect. Characters are very flat, especailly the clicheed and obvious antagonist. The premise is interesting and the first 25 pages strong, and while some concepts are addressed with a flair that would come to be known as distinctly David Brin, it is painfully obvious in this attempt that he was more scientist than author at this point in his career. In fact, it makes an interesting study to see how far someone can go, how great someone can improve if they just... you guessed it... practice."
1,I really hated this book,"Apparently lots of people like this book judging from the other reviews below, but I found it incredibly shallow and tedious. It had a premise with a little bit of promise, but the juvenile characterization really put me off. The characters seemed like cardboard cutouts of fantasy archetypes to me. In addition, I often felt like most twelve-year-olds could have seen right through the shallow notions of good and evil Brin works with.Other people who enjoy lighthearted fantasy works may indeed enjoy this. I've enjoyed other fun works of fantasy like The Princess Bride, though I tend to prefer fantasy writers that are more serious, like Tolkein and Stephen R. Donaldson. I haven't read any of Brin's other works, so I don't know whether I have a problem with all of Brin's work, or just with this book in particular. In any case, you may agree more with the other reviewers and love this book, but I wanted to provide an alternate perspective."
2,"Has Potential, But Didn't Quite Work for Me","The book has a cool premise, but the execution is shallow at best, boring at worst. A little more character development and a little less trying (and failing) to mimic Star Wars' dialogue would have been an improvement."
4,Brin had fun writing this one...,"If you are a physicist (like this reader), you will be rolling on the floor laughing. If not, you will simply find the book very, very funny. Brin sneaks in everything, from parodies of Star Wars to bad Latin puns. So it falls in the standard hero-goes-to-strange-country-and-makes-good, complete with Helpful Sidekick and Beautiful Damsel. So what? Brin obviously had great fun writing this one. I had fun reading it. Hope you do too."
2,Rediculous Scientific Premise = Rediculous Sci-fi Story,"I read the book long ago, about 8 years ago, I think, but one thing I do remeber is that the story revolves around the premise that the more you use an object, the more suitable it becomes for use. In other words, you can turn a zipper into a tree saw, with a little ""practice."" Does that sound like it makes sence? I thought not, and neither does the book, it sucks. You will see other reviews appollogizing for the fact that this is an early David Brin book, and is not as well written or developed as his other books, yet the book gets for or five stars from these reviewers. I say the book should be judged for what it is, David Brin or not. A crappy sci-fi story with a weak premise and cardboard characters."
2,A book without a cover,"Exactly that is what I got ordering this book. The service in itself was quick enough. However, I think it is not done to rob a book from its cover! Without that, the book loses some of its appeal, besides the tearing off of the cover being an act of vandalism.With the cover attached, the rating would have been the full five stars."
4,"TIME TO RE-MASTER, GUYS.","Westbound has a great catalog. Who knows what else is in there. This is a real decent one, although not the best, but since Westbound is rather scare you have to have it. However, some of these tracks have now been reissued on other Westbound compilations in better quality. This disc is from the early 90s and has a bit of a shrill sound, while Westbound has been getting really great sound these days, like on Wsetbound Northern Soul. Time to re-master."
5,Agenda for Planning and Action,Future Prospect has served us as an irreplaceable map to chart our ebusiness visions and strategies and to drive our company to be number one.
5,Breakthrough Value,"Penetrating through the swirling mist of high-tech business scenarios with vision and simplicity, Future Prospect offers the vital tools to configure your business for tomorrow's prospects. It offers executives and analysts with a roadmap and agenda they need to advance their carriers."
5,Great product when you know what you are doing.,"I've used this bar to flat-tow my Jeep literally thousands of miles without problems and love it. Works great for any vehicle/truck with solid bumpers or tow-points. Simple design, quick hookup and disconnect in seconds and very safe. Not sure why you would use this to tow a car with plastic bumpers though; if you wouldn't mount a tow-hook on your bumper this is not the correct tow bar for you."
1,"this product is BS, waste of money",bullsh product. should take them off the shelves. you can read the previous review on this product and i second it:). it wasted my time and money!!!
5,Excellent performance in superlative sound/picture,"Dmitry Hvorostovsky is amazing throughout, at the start of the performance I wondered how Jose Cura with his less than perfect tenor voice had managed to continue performing on the opera stage but by the end I knew --the guy delivers when it counts!! A committed performance, dramatically perfect. I have seen this opera numerous times and have the Pavarotti version on DVD with the excellent Azucena but the end of the opera did not touch me dramatically like this one did. the soprano also gave a very good, involved performance. Combine the quality of the performance with the sound and picture quality, and I'm in opera heaven!Highly recommended-get it on blu-ray!"
3,CURA ..CANTA SOLO IL VERISMO,"QUESTA EDIZIONE DEL TROVATORE MI HA INCURIOSITO PER GLI ELOGI LETTI.IO NON HO MAI ASCOLTATO CURA PRIMA DI QUESTO TROVATORE.PENSO CHE CANTA QUEST'OPERA COME NEGLI ANNI CINQUANTA DA TENORE VERISTA E SCENDENDO DI MEZZO TONO ""DI QUELLA PIRA"" NON DO MA SI.SE UN TENORE NON HA IL DO NON CANTI IL TROVATORE..OPPURE LO CANTI CON RICCARDO MUTI.BENISSIMO IL BARITONOBENE IL MEZZOSOPRANOMALE IL SOPRANO (ANCHE LEI SENZA ""DO"") E SFIATATA"
1,Verdi El Trovatore will not play.,I hate it because I can not see it. Will not play on any of our 3 TV'sWe have HD 1080 with Blue Ray. Paid $42.48.Would like to exchange for a compatible one. Unfortunately did not keep the box and return slip.Advise procedure.Gloria Nassergloria.n@travelstore.com
5,Verdi-Il Trovatore-DVD,"One of my favorite Verdi operas, well played out by the chosen cast with related staging. The voices of Hovorostovsky and Villarroel are superb. This was a most enjoyablle classical production."
3,Wrong movie,"I think the reviewer is referring to the 2006 ""The Good Shepherd"" which starred Robert De Niro and Matt Damon. This one stars Christian Slater."
4,Fun Read,Great book with some basic stuff and neat ideas too. Great for a young person or Adult getting into or back into archery.
5,Wolf tales,Good job by Ms. Tara K Harper continuing the saga of our favorite family...Dion and her children. Easy read pulls you into the story very quickly.
3,Nice album with some real gems,"The inclusion of ""Life's Been Good to Me"" and ""A Man Alone"" would, by themselves, make this album worthy of purchase. I probably could do without the spoken pieces, although they're not bad.I would probably rank this album 6th among Sinatra's Reprise albums, behind ""September of My Years"" (at #1), ""Sinatra and Strings,"" ""The Concert Sinatra,"" ""Sinatra Sings Great Songs From Great Britain,"" and ""Sinatra-Basie.""It's a travesty that the only ""greatest hits"" compilations that contain the aforementioned ""Love's Been Good to Me"" are also imports."
3,My favorite Alan Parsons Project lyric...?,"From the title track: ""...and those who came, at first, to scoff remain behind to pray."" It somehow strikes a cord with my ""conspiracy theory"" dominated view of the world at large. For once you step through that door and BELIEVE that things are not as they seem, there is no turning back."
2,Sterile streets,"2 1/2Falling back on the coasting success of uninvigorating pop, the album offers little incentive beyond title track for particular purchase."
4,great cd broken case,the cd is great but this is another case broken when it arrived with little protection for the cd.
3,"Prime Time's Prime, the others lacking something","Track 1 ""Prime Time"" is the undoubted best with Woolfson and the melodic keys and beat much like earlier Parson's songs. The others are just okay. Don't answer Me is a Pop song and I don't care for it. Buy the ""Definitive Collection"" instead of this albumn."
2,Just O.K.,A couple of good songs was about it. It sounded a tad fay like the other one. The first song was good.
4,"A considerable shift to the right, but still great!","First off, if this wasn't an APP album it'd get a definite 5, but since APP's previous stuff is THAT GOOD I gave it a 4. This album is a reassuring preview of what's to come from the Project, so fans of the old albums needn't be afraid. ""Prime Time"" is in the same vein as ""Eye In The Sky"", and ""Let Me Go Home"" is at the same high par as all other Lenny Zakatek tracks. ""Don't Answer Me"" quite easily has to the best track on the album. ""Pipeline"" is the only instrumental but it is very good. The album's only weak spots are perhaps ""Since The Last Good-bye"" and ""Dancing On A Highwire"". It has been suggested that if you consider Ammonia Avenue as NH3 AVE and move the N to the back you get an approximation of the word HEAVEN. Keep that in mind as you listen to the final track of the album."
2,Moving smartly along ...,"Well, let's put it this way ...I bought this when the vinyl was first released. Went with all the other APP albums I had. My 700 or so vinyl discs have since been entrusted to an old friend.I've since purchased *almost* all the APP CDs that I once had on vinyl. Not this one.For me, Pyramid was the pinnacle -- 5 stars. Love the rest of the first four, as well as Stereotomy and Gaudi -- 4 stars. I'd give 3 stars to Vulture Culture and Eye in the Sky. But this one and Eve just didn't do it for me.On a tangentially related note ... if you haven't heard Godley & Creme's Goodbye Blue Sky, try to find yourself a copy. A rollicking good time."
4,"""I had a premonition....""","""Prime Time"", ""Dancing on a Highwire"", ""Since the Last Goodbye"" and ""You Don't Believe"" are my favorites. ""Pipeline"" is a beautiful instrumental although admittedly, a bit repetitious. This was the last Parsons/Woolfson album I really liked a lot. Stereotomy sounds good though. But look at what came after: ""Vulture Culture"" (hardly a groundbreaking record) and ""Gaudi"", which is good, but seems way off course from where it all began. Songs on this album may be more radio friendly than the concept albums of the beginning and that may be the direction Parsons and Woolfson decided they needed to go, after all, you can't make beautiful music without money. ""You Don't Believe"" is another good song on this album."
4,A solid album--more pop oriented than their others,"I liked Ammonia Avenue from 1984, especially Don't Answer Me. But my favorite song on here is Prime Time, and it deserved more airplay and attention than Answer got in summer 1984. I heard it in Conyers, Georgia during a road trip in summer '84 and loved it. Don't Answer Me is such wonderful acoustic guitar playing--sometimes the Beach Boys' 1988 Kokomo borrows from that song. I'd have to say that Ammonia was their most pop oriented album, as Alan Parsons and his band load this album with lots of pop hooks that's a far cry from their '70s progressive rock period. It was just as strong enough to compete with Lionel Richie, Cyndi Lauper, Tina Turner, Huey Lewis and the News and other artists that dominated the charts of '84. The rest of the album is just as strong and musically deep. I didn't think that they would top 1980's Eye in the Sky but they sure did with this one. This is just as much a classic as their other albums."
3,"Some Good, Some Not","There sure are some great songs. ""Since the Last Good-bye"" ""Don't Answer Me"" may be even the best of their career. But I have to say there too are some not-so-needed songs, maybe because there are no definite concept on this one. So when I try to listen trough the whole album, I found it not easy, although, it may worth money only for those two."
5,"Not as well known, but best-in-class for iPod 5G","I have worked out with one of these for several years and is only now starting to need replacement.Here are the reasons I recommend this over other (more popular) iPod armbands:- Has a cutout on the bottom for the dock connector (extremely convenient for syncing)- No risk of it falling out (fits snugly)- Has a cutout for the iPod wheel- No chafing/irritation (and I've used it on the elliptical, treadmill, weights)My only criticism is that other armbands do have a place to wrap the excess length of a headphone cord, which I would like, but that's not enough for me to deduct even one star. I have worked out almost daily with this wrapped around my arm, and recommend it HIGHLY over all the better-known alternatives!"
5,"Fits great, but better for newer generations iPods","The pouch fits fine for my iPod classic, but it's just a tad too small. It's better for the newer generation iPods. It is secure though, and keeps the iPod in, even in the most rigorous activities. Also, the belt clip cannot be removed and was digging into my arm while wearing. I had to use pliers and a screwdriver to remove it, but now it feels comfortable on my arm."
4,Baywatch Hawaiian Wedding ...,"I really liked this movie, because I'm a fan of Baywatch.But there could have been a lot more added into the movie, like more Lifeguarding scenes, more action, more Baywatch characters from the different seasons, less predictability, etc.My two favourite characters from Baywatch are Stacy Kamano & Michael Bergin, who played Kekoa & J.D. on Baywatch ... they make such a great couple on the show.There could have been more romance between the different couples as well. The movie lacked in the romance department quite a bit ...Overall, it was a good movie.Recommended for Baywatch fans only."
3,Baywatch Is Back,"We get to see some of our favorites back such as, eddie,(no Shonnie though) Mitch ,caroline,Lonnie,JD,Cord,Leigh,Kakoa,Jason,Hoby,Summer, and CJ. The plot not hte best old adversary got to save every one. Also they had to put everyone in a couple I mean come on they are all gorgeaus peaple but still they work together before and nothing happened so why now huh? It other than that was a good movie though"
5,The Greatest...,If you like Baywatch this is the movie for you. This movie brings together cast and characters from previous seasons. This movie stands alone as the greatest of the Baywatch movies. I strongly recommend for the serious fan or if you enjoy action movies.
5,Baywatch Hawaiian Style!,"This Baywatch movie takes place in none other than Hawaii. It has the returns of the most popular stars including Mitch, CJ, JD, Caroline, Taylor, Summer, Lani, Hobie, Kekoa, Jason, Cort, Neely, Leigh, Eddy, and ""Allison"" (Stephanie look a like). The movie also has a returning guest star Cary Hiro-Yuki Tagawa as the villan Sato. It is a good TV movie and has great scenes of the Hawaiian Islands. As for the acting, you can judge that for yourself."
3,As expected,"this is a shirt. The shirt is standard-issue security guard. Tough construction. I have worn it only as a halloween costume, but hung on to it because it'll probably last me 20 years."
2,watch out,"I love the results that I get with this iron on my flat, straight, hard-to-curl hair. I cannot get results like that with any other product or tool. However, the tool is faulty. In six months it started sticking together when closed. And finally it wouldn't open at all. This is the second Vidal Sasson prodcut that I have purchased that has been a piece of junk."
1,Faulty product,"I loved this iron, until it stopped heating, only after 1 month of use. Don't purchase it. Invest in a quality product instead."
4,Love the waves,"After trying out my waver I love the type of looks it created, Depending on the amount of time or product I use I can creat anything from a messy day to day to look or something a little fancier. Overall great product :)"
5,Modern Talking is very popular on Cyber Radio,"Modern Talking's 98 remix of ""You're My Heart"" was in cyber-radio.com's top 10 for 1998. Cheri Cheri Lady is now in their top 20. They have been a very big artist for us"
2,BY THE NUMBERS,my apologies to those that actually like this kind of music but this kind of music is the exact reasondrum machines were created.
1,Arrived broken,Received a defective device that does not even work. Needle doesn't even budge when leads are touched in the ohm function. Waste of time...
1,I'd rather not review it.,"Very inaccurate AC voltage indication. The item is inexpensive... not worth returning or fussing about. It can be used to test flashlight batteries. I will be happy to enter a neutral review, but I can't honestly say the unit is fully useful."
1,Not What I needed,This is an analog meter. It needs to be calibrated. Maybe the one I got was defective. I could not get the calibration screw to move the needle. Sent it back. Probably should have spent more money for a decent one. ;(
4,Good basic meter,"While it doesn't compare to my digital Fluke, analog meters do have some advantages over cheap digital meters:- Can measure fluctuations and transients. Analog meters can also measure low frequency fluctuations, to a certain extent.- No batteries required. Batteries are needed for the resistance meter but the voltmeter and ammeter will work without batteries.- Good for quick readings. The analog needle reacts quickly, making it suitable for fast probing of multiple points. High, medium and low readings are easily seen with a glance at the needle.- Good for tuning electronic circuits to a specified value (example: setting a trim or variable resistor) as the needle's speed and relative position provides useful feedback.Rubberized case is also a nice feature."
2,"Pocket-size analog multimeter, YG188","This multimeter does not have the most important selection (110V and 220V) in the ACV selector dial. Testing a 110V outlet, If I set the ACV dial to 50, It will go over and if I set the ACV dial to 500 it will point to a little over 50. It can not give accurate or actual voltage. Another thing is that it show in the picture that the color of the back cover is yellow. Red was shipped to me. Would it be nice if you provide a color selection in the order page? My tools are color coded and I want yellow. That is one of the reason I chose this product because it is yellow."
3,Loose Test Wire Malfunction needed Repair...,This YG188 Multimeter was not properly wired when received and would function then not function on different occasions. I am referring to the wired-in test leads which were soldered in-to the circuit board badly and so were a short circuit.Rather than having to pay for shipping to return to the vendor i took the unit apart to find and re-solder the fault.It works fine now for the testing ive used it for.Still and all i should not have had to repair a brand-newly purchased unit.May you have better luck with this product.
2,You get what you pay for,"My husband has too many hats and finding a suitable storage spot was next to impossible. Stuffing them all in a tote or box was out of the question and we don't have any organization stores close to us. I was thrilled to find this product online and thought it was the perfect solution to our hat problem. After reading the other buyer reviews I didn't expect much out of this product but I ordered it anyway. All the other reviews were correct that the hats DO NOT fit in the clear sleeves properly so we hung the organizer on a door that isn't used much in our closet. As long as the hat organizer isn't moved around much, they do stay in the sleeves. I'm dissappointed with it but what can you expect for $8 anymore?"
3,"Great Idea, but mine seem defective","Great Idea... worked great for most hats, but some of the pockets, the seems were crooked and hats didnt fit. If they were straight, it's be perfect"
3,not bad,Hat organizer isn't bad. It does what it says but because the pockets for the bill of the hats are not that deep the hats lean forward and nearly fall out.
3,Middle row is smaller than side rows,I got this for my boyfriends fitted hats and they don't fit the middle row. Otherwise it works. Slightly disappointed.
4,use for my kid,"this hat organizer works better with small hats, is a little biger for my door, it touch the knob so i had to fix that. my son love it."
2,Does fit large billed hats,"If you own any motorcross or supercross hats, do not buy this as they will not fit. Also if you own any hats from DC Shoes, these will not fit as well."
5,hat storage,"this ball cap hanger is great.holds 24 ball caps nicely,so they dont get bent out of shape.it looks good hanging on door,with hats displayed .GREAT PRODUCT<GREAT SELLER,FAST SHIPPING"
2,Doesn't hold the hats!,"I should have listened to the other reviewers--this organizer is not a good hat holder! Maybe if you only had 24 regular sized ball-caps, it would hold them just fine. The hats I have are different sized and do not all have regular sized brims. And the ones that don't have brims at all I was hoping to just be able to tuck into a pocket--but even these fell out! I love over-the-door organizers and thought this would be a great solution for hat storage--and it wasn't. I don't know what would be, as folding up hats to fit in a shoe organizer doesn't sound like a great idea either. I took the organizer to work thinking I could use it to store office supplies, etc, but the door hangers only work for standard doors--not the nice big wooden doors at the office. So it sits in storage. I can't find a use for it and I don't know anyone with 24 ball caps to see if they can!"
5,REally does the job!,"For $8.00 this was a great investment. It came ready to hang & now my son's caps have a place to go rather than the floor or into the closet toss pile. It is clear plastic which makes it easy to see the logos. I do not know what the other reviewer expected for under $8.00 but I say ""buy it!"""
2,lame hat holder,"I did not like this product at all the pockets are shallow and every time I open the door it's attached to the hats fall out! I went to IKEA and bought a deep pocket organizer for half the price, it holds several hats in each pocket and they can't fall out."
1,Disliked,It was not made to hold caps securely. The pockets were not deep enough. After putting the bill of the cap in the pocket the body of the hat would flop over. Especially when you would move the door.
3,Hat rack,"It save space and I always know were my many hats are, but my hats fall out of some of the slots"
1,Hats fall out,I was disappointed. It does not hold newsboy type caps and the baseball style fall out unless you put them two of them in together and push them in hard. The slots are not deep enough.
2,Disappointing,"The organizer was very easy to remove from the packaging and took a mere 30 seconds to assemble. Although it is a nice design, only one out of all of my hats fit inside the pockets. Needless to say, I will be requesting a refund for this product."
1,never received item or contacted by seller,"I only gave it one star so it would go through. Otherwise, no stars...see above!"
2,"This series,","Jane Feathers' The Emerald Swan, gives just cause why stories should not come in sets of 2, 3, for more books as a rule. They lose their luster! The first books in this series was enjoyable but it lost it for me after that. The last books were boring and predictable. What's with all the romance novels being sold into so many books on the same story line anyway? I hate that. When I read a story and buy a book I want an ending and I want it to end with each book, thank you very much! I will not be reading any more romance type series books ever again. Yes, I am that annoyed!"
2,"Bad phone, good features","This phone would be excellent only if you could actually talk using the phone. The features of windows 5.0 are excellent but the phone has very poor reception. Its not the carrier, its the phone because other phones with the same carrier worked fine. Cingular does not know how to make good phones. They should stick to wireless services."
2,Bad joystick and poor reception practically make phone useless,"My title says it all. I think that the design of the phone is great. Like other reviewers have mentioned, I did not want a full-blown PDA. I want a small phone that also has ""smart"" features. However, the reception is horrible. I can't use the phone from work or from several other places in my small town. The free phone I received when signing up with Cingular gets full reception everywhere. The other problem is that the joystick barely works. I have to try several times every time I try to access any function. Thus the smart features are also a BIG pain to use because of the frustration of the joystick."
3,Could be better as a cellphone,Pros:1. Small size.2. WinCE 5.0 based so flexible to install third-party software.3. Can be easily unlocked and taken SIM cards from other carriers.4. Screen is ok but not as good as my Dell X51V which is VGA and 640x480.Cons:1. No auto-keyboard lock which is annoying.2. Alarm clock lacks fundamental functionalities and cannot be used if the unit is turned off.3. Battery could be longer.4. Joystick should be more easy to operate.
5,2125 is primarily a cell phone,"`Cingular 2125' is for them who primarily need a cell phone, a most impressive built smart phone I have ever seen. It does not weigh down my pocket like other PDA. It is missing QWERTY keyboard and I like that. Because I can do pretty much anything with just the main buttons and joystick. That's how space is saved. OS is Windows Mobile 5, does not come with Pocket Office (i.e. no Pocket Word, EXCEL etc.) but you can always add those or similar applications.I like because of its size, display resolution (QVGA), and style. I play my favorite music while it is hooked up with my laptop being charged. Sound volume is sufficiently OK and I do not need to use headphone provided. For PDA and faster keyboard activities I have the choice to buy infrared or Bluetooth keyboard. I can subscribe internet and surf. With faster EDGE data it can also acts as Bluetooth modem for my laptop. It also has camera that just serves my purpose. Why ask for anything more from a smart phone!"
1,More hornblowing and trumpeting.,"Want to taste jingoism? Read this book. Want to know how a biased book reads? Buy it. ""God Save the Queen,"" but not Paddy Griffith!Griffith, take my advice and take a course in objectivity and professionalism from J. Elting and G. Nafziger before you grind out your next book."
5,Helpful and instructive,"Niche Strategies offers a refreshing and insightful way to understand and build a competitive retail marketplace in the downtown by creating a critical area of unique products and services, the identity of a downtown can be enhanced benefiting everyone."
1,Forbidden...,"It should be forbidden to produce such a bad movie. I still can't figure out what was worse. The acting, the dialogues, the editing, the scenario, the BB guns, computer animated muzzle flash... I think I'll go with the acting.Its actually so bad it reminds me of a Kosovar movie I found at my local grocery store called Amerika UCK about UCK rebels saving the day. Honestly I wouldn't know which is worse. I mean Amerika UCK is home made filmed with a handy cam and gun fight sounds were done with one of those keychain gadgets.... and it has nothing to envy.Worst of all was that I was dumb enough to buy this.... good con."
1,"Inacurate, inarticulate and a total misrepresentation of the military.","All I can say is simply terrible, the movie is supposed to take place during the first gulf war in 1992, however all of the soldiers present are wearing a uniform that came out in the last 5 years which incidentally looks nothing like the old camoflauge utilities actually worn during the period.Screen shots are laughably and obviously staged, like the ship scenes. Apparantly if you show some grey hunks of metal in the same frame as your actor its the same as being aboard a ship. Weapons are completely rediculous. No recoil, obvious fakes. Not even like prop fakes, kmart fakes. The budget for this ""movie"" probably couldn't buy me groceries for a week.If there ever was a do not buy movie, this is it. Stay far far away."
1,Possibly the worst military movie ever made,"Horrible continuity , made by someone who knew nothing about the first Gulf War, naval insignias , weapons capabilities, and absolutely nothing about Navy S.E.A.L.s or how they are trained."
4,"A fun, old-fashioned cozy.","In this, the second book in the series (the first was MISS ZUKAS AND THE LIBRARY MURDERS), Helma the librarian is trying to organize her mostly Lithuanian classmates into having a 20th-year high school reunion, with little or no help from her best friend Ruth, the artist. Once again, Dereske gives us a fast-paced thriller that's hard to put down. She develops the characters introduced in the first book and adds a touch of romance, scandal, threats, anonymous letters, fog, and, of course, murder. MISS ZUKAS AND THE ISLAND MURDERS is a fun, old-fashioned cozy set on an island where murders and threats abound."
4,"Very ""Ten Little Indians""","When I started my first Miss Zukas book, I wasn't sure I'd like it. Now I'm hooked. Island Murders is my 3rd foray with Miss Zukas and she just keeps getting more enjoyable. I think her anal retentiveness is hysterical, and can't wait for Sherrif Gallant (no pun there!) to shake her up a bit.In Island Murders, Helma and her high school classmates are trapped on an island at a 20 year reunion from hell! People keep dropping dead! Once again, it's up to calm, cool, level headed librarian Helma to solve the mystery...with the help of her effervescent friend Ruth of course!"

4,Funny and Action,"This movie has a mix of comedy, adventure and love. A couple of robbers and a lot of funny troubles and emotion. I liked this movie too much."
3,an OK Weir Album,"Seriously, I bought this CD for one song "" Bombs Away."" Could not buy this song on itunes. But overall, not a bad CD of tunes."
5,Great Weir album,"Bob, though not the face of the Dead, was the heart that gave the Dead it's unique sound. This album is not a reflection of the Dead, but showcases the special flavor that Weir added to Jerry's genius, where 2 identities blend effortlessly. Dead fans may not like Weir alone, but many Dead Heads don't appreciate the Pizza Tapes either."
2,Bobby w/o The Dead?,"Sorry guys but I had to bring down the ridiculous 5 stars here. While this album doesn't hurt my ears, I can actually stand playing it unlike many cd's out there...it is FAR from great...song wise, performance, production-you name it. It is a VERY mediocre album which has all the stereotypical characteristics of a singer-songwriter album circa mid-70's. Too self-indulgent (for the musician that is-not us), too long (each song), and doesnt stand the test of time. I LOVE some of Bobby stuff witha and without the Dead...and he was a GREAT uniquely melodic rythym guitarist--humbled me (was exceptional) live with only a bass player (very difficult folks...Jerry likely would not have pulled that off as well) to my delight...but I vote NO on this album--especially if you dont have almost EVERY Dead release, or if it costs more than $.01! His latter year proselyzations (Jerry's axes being held hostage and explaining the ""reasoning"" of dolphins) don't garner sympathy for my review either."
2,Another Iacocca Wannabe,Do not buy this book is you are interested in learning about the interesting cars and trucks the author helped design.If you need another dose of management advice from a business executive who was successful in a narrow field and thinks he has a book full of brilliant insights to share - this is the book for you.
3,Read the first and last paragraphs of every chapter.,"If you read the first and last paragraphs in every chapter of _The Creative Priority_, you will get the gist of the book. If you read every word in the book, you will get ready for bed.There are some great ideas in this book, but the chapter titles probably have more impact than anything else. I recommend that every reader interested in creative business scan the book at Barnes and Noble (sorry, Amazon). This is a book you can get good ideas from while you're spending a few leisurely moments at a comfortable book store, but unless you're interested in Nissan I wouldn't recommend purchasing the book.For myself, I am interested in Nissan, so I was willing to wade through the prose."
4,Cagney Makes the Film,"City for Conquest is an ambitious film about New York City, based on a novel written in the late 30s. James Cagney is the quintessential New Yorker here, playing his characterization to the hilt, and to great affect.Ann Sheridan is his ""goil,"" who learns the meaning of love too late, but just in time. Though a decent hoofer (and a great cryer), Sheridan is saddled by her dance partner in the film, Anthony Quinn, who couldn't dance a lick. Thus, dance shots were at a distance or closeups of ""stand-in"" feet. Otherwise, Quinn was great as a greaseball ""villain.""Cagney's portrayal of a (for the most part) blind man (near the end) is very well actualized. Could have done without the ""Old Timer"" narrator/character, played by Frank Craven, who annoyed more than informed, but he had his purpose. Cagney does his own fight scenes.Extras include an interesting commentary, cartoons, and trailers"
2,Too Depressing a Movie,"I watched this movie last year with my brother, who forced me to watch what I knew would be a soft and sad one, and the only reason I am giving it a 2 is because Denzel Washington is in it. This movie was way too sad. I don't like movies like this one, and can't stand them because it is just too sad and depressing. The terrible abuse and bad things that happened to this boy was just too much to take-and when you watch the scene when he is in military confinement talking to Denzel's character about why he can't be intimate with women and the very next scene showing the CAUSE of it then you will see exactly what I am talking about. Just too depressing, sickening, stomach-turning, and agonizing the things that happened to him. I can only enjoy movies with action, DRAMA, suspense, and a lot of happiness to it."
1,Boring And Stupid,This movie is boring and stupid. It broke my heart when that man got shot in a corner store. I don`t wanna see this boring and stupid movie again. Period!
3,Three Stars,"U can't go wrong with Denzel in any movie. I thought this was a good story, not necessarily super dramatic or grandly entertaining but a good movie if you can relate to the story of I guy overcoming past stuff and getting a new life for himself..."
4,Great Movie,I really enjoyed the movie. The writer's did a great job with the script and the acting was great. I would highly recommed this movie to others.
5,Denzel & me.,"My oldest boy Bobby bought me thjis movie. we call him Bubby but he's a nice boy anyway.I wanted this dvd for ages and was very glad to get it, its all about this boy Antowne Fisher. He's in the military andyou can tell right away that this poor boy has been thru a lotta stuff. Poor kid. he starts working with that dreamy Denzel and i think id go see a doctor if it was Denzel to! Denzel really helps this boy Antwone and the ending is all sad but gave me a hopeful kinda feeling to.This movie is GOOD y'all! if you watch it your gonna cry and cray!"
5,A POWERFUL STORY.......POWERFUL PERFORMANCES,"FIRST OF ALL, BRAVADO DIRECTING/ACTING FROM DENZEL WASHINGTON-FIRST TIME DIRECTOR BRINGS IT ON! NEWCOMER DEREK LUKE IS SPECTACULAR IN EVERY SCENE...WHY WAS HE NOT NOMINATED FOR AN ACADEMY AWARD?...OH WELL, THIS GUY HAS THE ACTING SKILLS OF A VETERAN...AN EMOTIONAL AND MOVING TRUE STORY - BUT AT TIMES, IT CAN BE LIGHT HEARTED WITH A COMEDIC TOUCH-TOTAL ENTERTAINMENT-THIS ONE SHOULD BE IN EVERYONE'S MOVIE COLLECTION....ORDER IT TODAY."
4,A Well Done Drama,"This is an entertaining and very well done drama.Films of this type are usually not my favorites. This one is an exception. It features an unknown actor (to me at least) named Derek Luke in the title role. Denzel Washington appears as Navy psychiatrist Dr. Jerome Davenport. Although Denzel is the big name, he is not the star of this picture.Fisher is a very angry and troubled young man. He is a Navy seamen who cannot control his temper. Due to this issue, he is sent to Davenport. Fisher has no interest in talking or exploring his issues at all. Davenport continues to engage him. I won't go any further regarding the plot to avoid spoiling it.Although there is not a lot of action, the human and mentoring relationships are prominent. It is a story of one finding himself, positive change, and a life enhanced.This show is well worth watching."
5,GREAT!!!,This is one of Denzel's best movies. He is one of the BEST if not the BEST actors in the business. The Blu Ray presentation is great especially the scenes on the water. A must have for all movie collectors!
1,BLU-RAY REVIEW on Panasonic BD-10,"This is not a review about the movie even though I didn't care much for the main character. This is a warning to those who may own the first Panasonic BD-10 player. This movie did not play in my player. I returned the movie and got another and it didn't play either. I notified Fox but have yet to hear a response as of this writing. The movie gets stuck in the ""reading"" disc mode after you select play on the menu. I do have the latest update for the player."
1,Never Received the Item,"I never received the item. The seller has not yet responded to my e-mail requesting a decision. This is the first time this has happened to me and my disappointment is not with Amazon, but the seller for the unprofessional and lazy business practices.I needed the DVD for a class project and had to make other arrangements (plan B). So some time was wasted and I was inconvenienced by the lack of responsiveness of the seller."
2,over emotional,Too sentimental. Too long. And trying too hard to get an oscar.There are some good things in here but the movie never comes together like it should.
4,Heart felt with true valued accomplishment...,"One of Denzel Washingtons' finer rolls; This is a tale of a young mans journey from an unpleasant childhood to adulthood.Denzel Washington performance as a Naval psychiatrist that gets involved in the unstabled life of a troubled Navy Seaman,played by Derek Luke, who is forced to endure his young life amidst misery and torment but as they further intertwine togetherthey realize they're both in need of each others benevolence.I found this tale to be truthful and heart braking at times containing a joy-est ending that surely held my attention throughout.If your into Melodramas then I would suggest you watch this one. Hope this review helps you on your decision, Thanks..."
5,Great drama,"If it doesn't give a minute knot in your throat, then your one tough cookie. Great performance by the actor playing fish. About Denzel, what else would you expect?!"
5,The Dark Virus RETURNS,"Ras Al Guhl plans to unless a deadly virus upon the world...and only Batman, Robin, Catwoman, and Nightwing can stop him! Awesome artwork and plot line."
5,Love Sabrina Silver,I love Sabrina Silver. All the rings I've purchased there have been high quality. I actually bought this one for me because I like big funky rings and I wear it all the time!
4,From the prosecutors viewpoint,"A good case selection, in-depth, interesting and well written. It put the author on my list of books to read."
4,Justice versus the Law,"This memoir by a prosecutor concentrates on one murder trial in his long career. It is gripping. My lasting impression, however, is that oft quoted accusation ""the law is an ass"". The judge ruled incriminating evidence as invalid on a technicality. How the prosecutor struggled to overcome this handicap gives the trial extra fascination."
4,Hard to put down,"This book was hard to put down. I don't usually like books written in the first person, but this one was a definite exception. Flynn, a prosecuting attorney, weaves an amazing story. He tells things in the order in which he discovered them. I completely agree with the cover of the book - ""An aspicious debut...reads like a thriller.""Flynn is given a case of a murdered mother and daughter. And it's not just a murder, these two women were butchered. Gruesome details, a man hunt, amazing testimonies, and edge of your seat excitement is what this book is all about. If you are squeamish, you might not want to read this book. However, if you enjoy a good thriller, you won't want to miss it!"
3,Good intro to managing databases but short on details,"This is an overall solid book, covering all aspects of running a MySQL database, from the impact of various flavors of hardware to architecting database clusters. However, I was expecting more details and insight about configuring and scaling MySQL. What are some of the finer points of implementing database clustering or federation? How does indexing and caching work in MySQL? How much will data fragmentation impact performance? In the end, even though the title suggests it covers advanced topics, I didn't learn much new from this book."
2,It could have been better,I'm Certified MySQL Associate and preparing for the next exams (Developer and Admin)... and I must say I didn't liked the book.It offered nothing new for me... so if you're at a high level in MySQL it will not help you that much.I saw some slides by Jeremy that were by far more informative and compact than the whole book.To keep it short the complete title should have been: High Performance MySQL for MySQL beginners.
2,Lacking substance and will not benefit the pro DBA,"Hi thereComing from an Oracle and SQL Server world, not alot changes really between the enterprise class DBMSs, many of the same best practice principals apply. Unfortunatly, this book falls WELL short of the mark.The book only glances over tuning, with no thorough look into the startup parameters for example. Indexing, stats collection etc is also very poor and there are no discussions on internals (to save us all from reading the code!).The replication chapter was OK, but I would seriosly suggest that the modelled replication model for load balancing is a really bad idea and a maintenance/cost nightmare.For a prod dba from Oracle or SQL, you will be very disappointed."
4,Easy Reading but lacking some things,"This is a book for someone that knows MySQL and wants to give a leap forward, the book is an easy read, you start read and in an afternoon you finish it (it is not a boring book).Despite all the explanation between the different engines, master/slaves, optimized queries, there is no answers about the topic of binary versus compiled install. The author has 2 or 3 pages about it but it doesnt say absolutely nothing"
4,La Vie en Yves,"Yves was a human contradiction.Famously French, he was actually born in Italy. Good in European films, less good in those made in Hollywood.A good music-hall singer,discovered by Edith Piaf (who put him in her shows -- and her bed). Sometimes less good: there's an occasional whiff of fromage on some songs. But Yves gets away with this because he's so utterly charming otherwise.He was a womanizer and a devoted husband. He conducted multiple affairs -- Marilyn Monroe was the one most of us pretended to be scandalized by -- while remaining happily married to the sensual, sultry Simone Signoret until the day she died.The point is, these contradictions ultimately work for the music.The overall effect is unique. A little odd. Occasionally cheesy. But charming and seductive -- all the more so if you have some decent Bordeaux in the house.A little like Yves himself was, I suspect."
3,Needs remastering,"The music on this album is huge. However, the original 2-record vinyl release would blow you away. This one (the CD release) has been dumbed down to fit on one CD. And hey! It almost fit! You can almost hear the MBA's talking on this one: ""Speed it up, cut a little off the top and bottom of the songs, who needs audio resolution anyway, these guys are all stoned."" In short, it ranks as one of the worst-sounding CD's I own. But the music is so good it deserves a remastering. I'd buy another copy if it were."
4,Brokedown Palace,"One of my current favorite versions of Brokedown Palace - lovely short, tasty, solo + soulful Jerry vocal and delicious band harmonies. Like this version of Samson and Delilah. Rockstar Bobby! Nice tight Franklin's Tower, too..."
5,Get the Bonus Tracks! version,"Though the original release for a pittance used is obviously worth it for a CLASSIC dead album, the re-issue has an additional cd of prev. unreleased songs (Shakedown, NFA, Let It Grow, etc) that rock, and make this one of the better GD products. We are all so familiar with the versions on Dead Set that other releases may be more exciting at least at first, but this is a can't miss Classic. LOSER vocals/giutar solo!! BROKEDOWN vocals/solo!! chilliy bumps man!"
5,"I've always loved this ""album""",Who wouldn't love this great quality soundboard recording? The set-list has long been one my favorites. It was nice to be able to get it used and not at the expensive import price elsewhere.
3,A Different Sort of Argument,"You would think a book like this would be a very dry read, but you would be wrong. The way it challenges ideas that so many of us (both Christian and Jew) hold to be fundamental truths kept me turning pages for hours on end. I also liked the way the author was both even-handed and logical in dealing with the roots of anti-Semitism. While not glossing over the ancient and more modern traditions of Christian anti-Semitism, Blech rightly points to the inherent ""separateness"" of Jewish communities around the world as playing a part. Though he misses some finer points in his arguments (for example, there were no ""civic celebrations"" in the ancient pagan world in which Jews - or Christians, for that matter - could participate while being true to their religion), this is a good read, especially for those with a working knowledge of both books of the Bible."
2,The bible is for jews only!,"The Old Testament is only a partially-true historical document, created by and for jews only. The New Testament doesn't have the cachet for trustworthiness. Religion is strictly the effect of mental conditioning so when reading this book, which may try to make sense without actually mentioning the reasons religions exist, keep in mind (pun intended) that the contradictions found in the bible are really meaningless as there is no jewish god, and Jesusianity (erroneously called christianity) has no historical evidence to support it."
1,The Ã­tem never arrived,"Hi, the Ã­tem never arrrived and Amazon send me a Mail talking about return the item... But I never recive the Ã­tem."
2,"This isn't ""Eye in the Sky""!!!","This isn't the real ""Eye in the Sky"" album! It's a ... ""Best of"" without any real graphics or liner notes. (I haven't opened it, since it's going back, so I could be wrong, but I doubt it. There is a picture of AP himself, sitting on a chair, on the cover.)What this CD says that it has on it is:- Eye in the Sky- Time- Damned If I Do- Standing On Higher Ground- Mammagamma- Psychobabble- Games People Play- Stereotonomy (That's how they spelled it - i gess that they don't have a profreeder)- Sirius- Snake Eyes..."
5,Track Listing,Side 11-Sirius Instr2-Eye in the Sky3-Children of the Moon4-Gemini5-Silence and ISide 21-You're Gonna Get Your Fingers Burned2-Psychobabble3-Mammagamma Instr4-Step by Step5-Old and Wise
4,Entering the pop era,"After several progressively influenced concept albums, the APP returned strongly with ""Eye In The Sky"". It was a welcome return to form after the synth-heavy, boring ""Eve"", even though Eye is more pop than anything else they had recorded at this point. Eye really points to the future sound APP would go for on subsequent releases. The material is very good, and the final song ""Old And Wise"" should send chills down the spine of anyone with a pulse.The remastered version adds quite a lot of brilliance and air to the recording when compared to the original Arista release."
4,If I tried to write a million words a day,"What else more can I say about this album that hasn't already been said? I find it truly innovative in terms of songwriting and stereophonics. I reccomend listening to it on headphones: the stereo's quite exquisite. Elmer Gantry sings his @$$ off on ""Psychobabble""."
5,FAntastic,Alan Parson's at his finest ! This is a classic album by one of the best producers and arrangers in the music business
5,Arguably APP's best,"This album is probably APP's most commercially successful album, and it deserves it. The title song went top 10 in 1982, as you may recall, and is still popular on theme radio stations. The other reviewer discussed APP's complexity in this album. He is absolutely correct. Complicated instrumentals drive Mammagamma and are an exceptionally brilliant part of Silence and I. Lyrics are outstanding as usual; not your usual ""She loves you, yeah yeah yeah"" fare. APP challenges the listener in all their almbums, and never moreso than here. These songs will become a standard part of your listening. I have probably listened to this album more than any other (perhaps 200-250 times)."
4,Siriusly,"What an awesome beginning to an album. If only the rest of it compared to the opening song, ""Sirius"". There are still many good songs here. ""Psychobabble"" is one and all are listenable. ""Eye in the Sky"" practically got played to death. I have to say that I don't think this album compares to Parsons first three but it is difficult to come out with one masterpiece after another. Portions of this album compare to Parsons great early works. It is definitely good music, even though many of the songs are on the ""soft"" side. For first time Parsons listeners I wouldn't recommend it although I think for some it would be a good place to start and probably was for many because of this album's incredibly dramatic introduction."
3,"not quite what I had expected, but satisfactory","its okay, but I was hoping for something more like Turn of A Friendly Card or Tales of Poe... However the service and package were great"
2,Finger in the Eye,"I love the early Alan Parsons Project albums, so I bought ""Eye in the Sky"" based upon others' reviews stating that it was the best or most popular of all Parsons' releases. In my opinion it had one good song but overall the album/cd had no heart. I have no desire to listen to it again. If I keep it, I feel that it will be like my copy of ""Try Anything Once"" which I've listened to maybe five times in as many years of possession."
1,"Folding the item in shipping, creates a break in the pad","Got this item, the folding crease breaks as soon as you use it, sent it back, got another one, same problem, very expensive for a product that breaks so easily..."
4,A modern art form,"In the country then known as Zaire, and now as the Congo, Strother spent some time studying the Central Pende ethnic group. Specifically, she analysed the role that masks played in their society. The book has many photos of intricately designed masks. Pretty!But the book is more than just nice pictures. Strother has conducted a serious anthropological study of what the masks represent and their history. Essentially, she shows that the construction and symbology are not some age old ritual. Rather, a virtue of her study is that she places the Pende masquerade as an active, modern art form. As legitimate as any contemporary art movement in a developed country. Too often, African art is only studied in retrospective mode. Strother shows otherwise."
2,not up to the standard i would expect from lonely planet...,"I wasn't impressed with this video. The host really got on my nerves. I definitely see the point of getting off the beaten path - it's what I want to do whenever I travel. But the itinerary he pursued in Japan was just RANDON! Most Americans would not choose to go to Okinawa for quite a few good reasons... The content of the video was a little bizarre - the host talked to a bunch of western bar hostesses in Tokyo, sang horrible karaoke in front of a bunch of Japanese women, and then got on his soapbox about animal rights... And the horrible filler of the host on the ski slopes... Not really what I needed to see - this video was basically a waste of my time.I was hoping for a more thoughtful look at Japan and I did not find that with this video. The Lonely Travel Japan and Hiking in Japan books are really informative though..."
1,"Lonely Planet-come on, you can do better than this.",I love Lonely Planet video-my middle school students love them. But this edition was a massive disappointmet. Only the Okinawa part was worth watching. Pass on this one.
1,Just horrible..,"I came across this tape at a local bookshop in the travel section, I was happy to finally find a video about Japan, unfortunately I realized too late that it was a big waste of money, they should change the title to ""I hate Japan"" instead, I was so disappointed by how the filming was taken, how the host was just shown the bad side of Japan, it wasn't really helpful at all, I haven't been to Japan before but I know more than he does!It's really not worth watching or purchasing."
1,Offensive,"The smirking British host goes out of his way to present only the silliest, most bizarre aspects of Japanese life and culture. He and the producers obviously had an agenda of casting this dignified, rich culture in as poor a light as possible. Given the antics of the royal family in the UK, I'm amazed that this bloke has the chutzpa to belittle any another culture."
3,MIYAKO NO SHIMA IS AN ISLAND TOO BETWEEN TAIWAN AND OKINAWA,THE YEARS WERE 1952 1953 1954and there were many people on the ground in korea and there were not enough aircraft carriers so Miyako island was one and in the local lingo wakaran meant what one would do if there was a big shell hole in the middle of the road
1,Too good to be true,They should say that the CD songs are only half and not full. I should have read the reviews never the less. Very dissapointed.
3,Ok buy at a decent price,"I was rather disappointed with the cd and the with length of the tracks, but it isn't all that bad. The songs do not abruptly end but they are mixed in to the following song. If you are into mixes then it is perfect for you. It gives you a taste of something like 30 of some of the best songs by Los Cadetes....Las canciones de este cd no estan completas y estan mezcladas con las otras canciones. Cuando una cancion se acaba derepente sigue la proxima cancion. Es un buen cd con 30 canciones pero a la otra buscare un cd con las canciones completas."
1,He Should Ask for Readers' Forgiveness,"The best comparison I can think of is this collection of poetry is a Big Mac, when you really wanted something more satisfying like a steak. Poem after poem seems caught up in self-aware, self-indulgent ""look at me I'm a poet!"" and ideas never taken to their full extent. None of these poems are overly memorable. Some seem just shallow attempts to offend as many people as possible, recycling themes that have been used over and over again, but often done better by other poets. Perhaps he is an excellent reader in person, but the poems should have some power when read on their own, which these fail to do."
5,Pathos & pathology . . . Confessions of a neurotic genius.,"McDaniel is maturing as a poet. In this collection he is revealing without lapsing into self absorption. The work is spare, thoroughly accessible, I never scratched my head trying to find the root of some obscure metaphor. He lays himself open in plain, effective language and, as usual, nails his subjects. Buy it, read it, hate him for writing so damn well."
5,An Amazing Artist,"Jeffrey McDaniels paints incredible pictures inside my brain as I read through his poetry. ""The Forgiveness Parade"" is one book that I always keep by my side and can read over and over again. I'll be picking up his newest as soon as I have money!"
4,Not Free SF Reader,"A strange alien artifact is found on the moon. It is fascinating, and very, very lethal. It has been going through men's lives at a frightening rate, so a new technology to use facsimiles of people has been created, so they can go in, explore a little, die, and do it again.One problem with this is those doing the exploring are very likely to go crazy.A search is on for a man who can deal with the psychological stress of the project.It also looks at their lives off this experiment and how they deal with that in the meantime."
4,"An excellent, honest book","This book keeps getting beaten up for not being science or pure sociology, and reviewers keep missing what is excellent about it--the intersection of the writer's own reflections, aspirations and ideas with the violent, dull, and endless world of incarcerated young men. Padnos's honesty about his own motives and feelings give this book a rare freshness. In his attempts to connect the books he loves to the real and brutal world of these men, he illuminates much about the struggles of growth, the uneven progress of our ambitions, and the enduring power of stories to shape all of our lives."
4,Floorfilla is Da MAN!,"Floorfilla's Anthem #2 is definately a great song to play in the club. If your a club DJ, this is the song for you. I listen to no other type of music except club, and techno and I can tell you, Floorfilla is good quality techno."
5,Like techno? You'll LOVE Floorfilla!,"Until a few months ago, I'd never even heard of Floorfilla, but when I found out about their music, I could't stop playing it! In the halls of our school, I have a tendency to play Floorfilla and other artists over my ""portable"" speakers, and it turns entire hallways into raves! Techno culture in our school has literally taken off ever since I discovered this group, and this is coming from a small-town AMERICAN, where techno was very much the minority. Even the AV guys play this after band concerts, which is about the coolest thing to ever hear! Buy this, and all their other singles! You WON'T be disappointed!"
1,Building Healthy Minds: The Six Experiences That Create Inte,"Very disappointing. Whilst I agree with the underlying concepts, the book is repetitive and arduous. New chapters, with interesting headings, merely repeat what was said in previous ones. The contents page tells the story and time spent on reading the detail reveals little new information.Whilst not disputing the author's experience, as a mother, my intuition will stand me in better stead than the instructions of a strange man. I recommend that other disappointed readers purchase Jean Liedloff's ""The Continuum Concept"". More concise, thought-provoking and stimulating."
4,very nice watch the glow is the best you can find,"I have a number of good watches, and the material they use for the glow in this one is the best. The watch looks good and well made, the band is sturdy, it is not as easy to remove as my Citizen diver, I think the Citizen band is smoother. Over all this looks to be an above average watch that looks good and will give good service the band is sturdy the lach on the band is stiff and not as easy to remove.I do over all like this watch..."
3,Your Executive Image,"Your Executive Image promises to be an exciting new addition to the literature on ""self packaging."" It is divided into three parts--body language, wardrobe, and etiquette. In writing her comments, I found that Seitz uses standard references such as Color Me Beautiful or Emily Post. In short, no new material was introduced in Your Executive Image. Seitz simply put together three disparate topics, summarized the topics, and published her synopsis."
1,WATCH OUT,"If you can manage to get it on, this may be a good slipper. I am a 9 1/2D and ordered a 10D. On arrival, I found it nearly impossible to insert my foot through the undersized opening so I advised Amazon and they provided me with a shipping label for returning the slippers. I shipped them with that label about 6 weeks ago. Amazon has now advised me the it has not been received and they are billing me for it. This seller did not acknowledge receiving the return and I am stuck with trying to resolve the issue with Amazon."
5,Awesome gift for a Nancy fan!,"Ordinary notebooks are just so boring! If you're one of those ladies who always must be jotting down bits of this or that (perhaps to solve a case?) then this ultra-cool Nancy Drew Notepad is for you.This study item is awesomely pretty, as only original classic cover art can be. If The Haunted Showboat was/is one of your favorites, by all means treat yourself today! At this price, they are bound to go fast.This would be a great gift for any age group."
2,New Age documentary,"The photography is good. Some of the architectural explanations--the sheer mysteries of Chartres--were fascinating. But much of the rest is inane babble, featuring discussions of reaching silence, finding the self, and arriving at the center of the labyrinth. New Age thought receives more attention than Catholic Christianity and the Middle Ages. We even get a lecture on the similarities between the architecture and Hinduism! In short, this film was worth neither the time nor the money."
2,Very disappointing,"I thought this would be an art history product with primary focus on the architecture, stained glass and statuary. Instead, much of the disc is devoted to discussion of the spirituality of the cathedral, how it makes one feel. A fair amount of the 1-hour DVD is spent on showing a speaker's head and shoulders rather than showning the building.The ""editorial review"" shown on this site actually is the blurb from the back of the box."
5,I second what Matt wrote,"I just want to add my five star vote. The reviewer ""Matt"" has said it well enough."
4,Good example of pre-date creativity,"Mixing epochs and people-major characters are being performed by the same actors, did they?-it is still, ninety years on since appearing, a powerful testimony to a human endless creative imaginary correlated with technical means available to date in particular social environments.Looking outdated technically, it is a good work to remake."
3,Old movie,This is an old movie - fairly interesting but probably not one to watch often. We ordered it to get ideas of costumes of the era.
3,An historical landmark,"D. W. Griffith's films are badly dated now. Birth of a Nation is historically important, but violently racist. Intolerance isn't overtly racist, but just as simple-minded. On the other hand, no one, in the history of film, has ever been as ambitious. No one else has taken four different stories, from four different historical periods, and combined them in one grand epic - like four tributaries flowing into one great river. For students of film only."
1,Intolerance is intolerable to watch!,"Perhaps highly innovative in its time, this film is hopelessly dated and, at three hours in length, difficult to sit through. The first couple of hours seem to drag as the film jumps between four separate and convoluted story lines; though the last hour with its actions sequences and rapid pacing isn't too bad. Another problem that I have with the film is that it is overly preachy; Griffith practically clubs you over the head with his Victorian ideological message."
3,The Brownlow/Gill Thames Silents' version with the Carl Davis score on (HBO) VHS...,"...from the 90's is worth hunting down as you have never really seen this movie without a full orchestral score. Honestly, it'll transform your opinion of this film, making it more intimate and epic, sort of like Morricone's score for the 1913 Richard III. All the Thames Silents are superior presentations. This is my favorite film of all-time, but only this version."
3,Intolerance,I did not have any problem with this item. I would buy from Amazon.com again. It was an Alpha Video and in the past about 75% of Alpha Video's have one or both problems in the video production and in the audio. I just received an order containing two Alpha videos and I will be returning both because the video quality is very poor and the audio is not much better.
5,Intolerance,"Stung by accusations of racism after the debut of his ""Birth of a Nation,"" Griffith decided to assuage his detractors and at the same time top his previous masterpiece with this lavish meditation on cruelty and persecution. With colossal stages, a vast universe of extras, and some of the most jaw-dropping images ever recorded on film (check out the fall of Babylon sequence!), ""Intolerance"" is a masterpiece of epic melodrama and set-piece grandeur. Among the cast, Harron (as the contemporary hero), Lillian Gish (as the symbolic Woman Who Rocks the Cradle), Mae Marsh (as the ""Dear One"" in the modern tale), and Constance Talmadge (as the Girl From the Mountains) are especially striking. And the brilliantly innovative parallel climax of all four stories is a feat of ahead-of-its-time editing technique that may still take your breath away."
2,Ponderous: a kind of writing,"Being a fan of the philosophy Honderich does, I admit to being dissapointed at the sort of re-telling his life has recieved. The clarity and knowledge that exist in his professional work are translated here...to the most tedious degree. One senses a Continental cloud descending as one attempts to remember the last page read. He was dating who? His colleague said what? The nerve...and the boredom. After reading the life of Ayer retold by another, I wonder if Ted should have waited for posthumous recollection. He seems to be leading the same life as his mentor, minus the dash. Proceed immediately to the last chapter and philosophical summary to retain your interest.Honderich maintains an excellent web site, devoted to issues of determinism and the ravaging of his critics. I suggest you visit there instead of these pages...it's free."
5,Quiet as a mouse,"I just replace the rear brake pads on my 2002 odyssey and these work great so far. They feel solid under braking and there is absolutely no sound no even when breaking them in. There was zero break in time, my first test brake was quiet and strong. I cannot comment much on how these compare to OEM rear pads because the majority of the braking is done by the front brakes in cars, but I plan on using these from here on out. Once I replace the front pads on any of my cars I will leave another review."
2,'The World We Knew' is not really worth knowing as a CD,"This album has too few really good , worthwhile , emotionally affecting performances - those things are the reasons many people listen to Frank .The tracks I return to are the title track and ""You Are There "" for the melodies , ""Drinking Again"" for the arrangement , atmosphere and delivery , as well as ""This Town"" which is tough and punchy . As for the rest , it is really disappointing .I suggest you find a friend who has this CD and somehow make up your own compilation . Some songs you will not need to hear again .There's something weird about hearing a bad album from a person who recorded their fair share of masterpieces .I hope this review helps you to make the right decision for you as a listener ."
5,truly undescovered sinatra,"this record is a gem! ranks right up there with the Three cd set Sinatra the Columbia years which is sensational. the title track is wonnderful, the duet with his daughter Nancy Something Stupid is a delight, don't sleep on the subway station is a hoot. yet the mecedes benz goes to you are there it's simply a lovely song! if this record ever comes back on print I would get it ina heartbeat it's just that good!"
3,Just the three of them,"The sweet has always been one of my favourite groups. My favourite era is the one between 75 and 80. This one dates from 79.It is their first without Brian and one can only deplore it.Although they do an acceptably nice job on singing here, it is hard to replace such a talented vocalist.The best songs are eye games, mother earth and Hold me (which I think is one of the best songs they ever wrote). It's too bad they didn't use the version of mother earth showcased on the platinum rare album which is a whole lot better,true, the cut above... version still gets the job done. Nice lyric also and Scott singing suits it fine. The other songs are rather mediocre. So, people unfamiliar to the sweet should better avoid this one and go for a compilation album. Fans will probably highly enjoy this one,or at least some songs on it."
4,Excellent glasses for most white wines,Designed to enhanced taste of wine.Effect on wine with this glass less noticeable than with the Montrachet (for Oakey Chardonnay) or Pinot Noir glasses.
4,Good CD!!!,Good Disc from a great band. The guitar playing by Jones and Thomasson is awesome. Arguably the best guitar assault in all of Southern Rock. No Henry Paul on the album is a letdown. Overall a good live album to sit out by the pool and listen to with a cold one in your hand!!!
5,Great CD,One of the best live albums of all time. The Outlaws always were a better live band then their cds made them sound like. Much heavier and harder sounding live. Not that Im complaining they are one of my favorite all time bands live or album....
5,Great for my hamster,"This is great bedding for my little robo hamster. He loves burrowing in it, it never smells up my tiny 10x10 living space, and I only go through one bag a semester."
3,It's okay,It didn't last as long as I would have liked. Rather like regular wood chips. This was for two guniea pigs.
5,Hamster prefers it!,I had it before and changed to something else. She was happy to get it back. It is easy on her feet to run around.
3,Need to be gentle,"I bought this to hold my whiteboard up, and sure it does indeed do so. However, if I apply just a little less than baby pressure, the locks that hold the white board up loosen and the whole thing falls. It happens quite a bit, but personally I've learned to be very sensitive with it."
5,I CANT BELIEVE IT,THATS ALL I CAN SAY!!! SUCH AN OBSCURE VIDEO. YOU CANT EVEN FND IT FOR RENTAL ANYMORE. WAY TO GO BLUE UNDERGROUND. I REMEMBER ME AND FRIENDS SEEING THIS IN OUR TEENS AND SCREAMING OUR BRAINS OUT. I JUST HOPE SOUND QUALITY IS DECENT. THE VIDEO I WON SOMEWHERE IS PRACTICALLY INAUDIBLE
4,The Prowler,"The Prowler is a different type of Slasher Genre Horror movie, it actually wasn't boring and the usual,although the getup isn't scary(Soldier's outfit) however the story is unique among the countless slasher films."
3,typical slasher,"i heard this was one of the better slashers, but in reality it doesn't stand out. my big problem was the fact that i knew who the killer was in the first 2 min. of the movie, just listen to the clever dialogue, and also the first half dragged. before i get this i'd get another one first, like sleepaway camp, where you find out the killer is the girl, but she's a BOY!!!!!!!!"
4,Tom Savini is good at them there special effects,"Savini's effects are the highlight of this flick. For once you get to see his stuff without the editors messing it up. Probably what F13 would have been, had it not been so heavily censored.The movie is SLOOOOOW in the middle, but the effects make it a must have for Horror/Savini fans. When the girls throat continues to bleed and bubble underwater in the pool i was hooked. You just don't see that very much. Shocking! Scandalous!"
4,80s Slasher Triumph,"Being a fan of the 80's slasher genre, I thought it was obligatory to see this film.Directed by Joe Zito, this film pleased this horror/suspense fan.The editing was so superbly done that it only adds to the rise of the plot.Tight and choppy, yet, at the same time, maintaining an odd continuity that pleased the thrill-seeker in me.Vicky Dawson played the ""surviving victim"" with such method, that one truly entered the screen and not once did I think: ""Oh no, where'd they get this bimbo?"" Her affect and countenance was on cue and certainly delivered the scares and heightened the suspense.Christopher Goutman never really adds any flavor to the scenes and is cinematically no more than an appendage.This film doens't pretend to be a who-done-it. There is no true effort to deduce who is the prowler. This film takes the viewer on a true rollercoaster ride of fright and relief."
3,Brilliant gore effects,"The Prowler (AKA Rosemary's Killer) is probably around average in the slasher movie categry. It isn't origional but has some pretty impressive qualities that put it above a lot of others. There were only a few death scenes and there was almost no character development. However, the death scenes that DID happen were very good. All of the kills were on-screen and very bloody and, despite having been made in 1981, the gore effects were much more impressive then a lot of the CGI we see in modern films - it looks REAL. The killer himself (or herself) is actually pretty creepy and there's a scene where the killer is under the water when a soon-to-be-victim is trying frantically to swim away which I found very suspenceful.Overall there are both good points and bad points to this movie. I would say that it is worth a watch for fans of the genre because of the amazing gore effects by Tom Savini."
1,Painfully boring,"I bought this film knowing that Tom Savini did the gore effects...well that didnt save this horrorible slasher. First off most of the movie is just people walking around in the dark with no action, talking, or plot going on at all. The murders, while nice and gory are few and far between. The killers outfit and the story on why he is killing is soooo lame I want to laugh and cry at the same time. The ending is pitiful and not surprising at all. I love horror movies, but this one is not worth the time. Get My Bloody Valentine instead."
1,childish waste of money B-movie,"I like slasher-movies very much, and I thought I was in for a treat with this one, since the director is Joseph Zito. He directed Friday the 13th part 4 (in my opninion the best of the series); but this I think is a stupid, boring, predictable, amateur B-movie. Lots of scenes are too dark, sometimes I just can't see a thing, even when I adjust the brightness of my TV and lay my eyes ON the screen, I can't see nothing several times. Bad movie, if you're curious, rent it, but don't waste your money buying it."
2,A Weak Entry in The Slasher Film Era,"This film is a by-the-numbers slasher film from the early 1980's. The characters are very dumb and do all the wrong things and get themselves killed just because it is required by the script. No one in their right mind would do some of the stupid things these characters do. Its all very much a standard slasher film. The killer in this film is a guy dressed in an army outfit so that is a bit different from many of the killers in slasher films. The only thing that helps this film to stand out are the amazing gore effects by the legendary Tom Savini. Some of his best work was done in this film. If you are a gorehound, then this film will be worth viewing once for Savini's gore effects. Otherwise, skip this boring film."
2,"Moves at a glacial pace, but nice FX","This film seriously moves at a glacial pace and is not all that scary. It has some decent acting and the effects are great, but if I had to see the lead characters slowly walk around a dark house with a flashlight one more damn time I was going to scream. Boredom mius threats is NOE suspense. Also, the ending left me a bit cold. Meh. Just over-rated because of a two of the kill scenes, in my opinion."
2,Don't believe it's 150 watt!!,"There is no way this amp is 150 watts! Unless you have a foot peddle for your guitar for distortion or whatever as there is no ""Gain"" control on this amp. Decent sound for an acoustic but not 150 watts worth!"
1,Do not buy it,"I have bought several guitar amps and this one was a piece of work... it has several problems and the one thing i bought it for was the line out and that doesnt work right, it is amplified, making it not a true line out more like a headphone out"
4,Made for one happy brother!,"I ordered this for my brother for Christmas, after it being delivered to the wrong address (Fedex's fault) I decided that the stress of finding it was all I could handle for one day and let him have it early. I like 900 miles away so he opened it on Skype with me he was very impressed with the product. However it didn't come with a cord and his was somewhere else so I haven't heard it yet but I haven't heard from him so I am assuming he's been jamming the last 6 hours. It was more than worth the price and even the shipping hassle! Will highly consider ordering from this company again"
4,Its a pretty cool amp,many people say that this amp dousn't work good I disagree this amp work nice and it is pretty loud and sound great. only thing is is that it sounds more acoustic than electric but still good so if you need an amp under 80 dollars then I say you shoud get this one because thats how much I paid for it.
3,"Some funny, some not","The 2 disks feature several stand-up comedians, some of whome are really funny and others, not. George Carlin, for example, bombed. He was a funny comic in his early years, but not here. I can't imagine why this particular Tonight Show appearance was included. Drew Carrey is another bomb, but then I never thought he was very funny.My favorites in this selection are Rodney Dangerfield, Gallagher, Rita Rudner, and Brett Butler. The rest are so-so."
2,a little disappointed,I have to admit that I was a little disappointed with this item. Most of the comedians that appear in the episodes are not well known and frankly weren't very funny. I can't wholeheartedly recommend this item.
1,BIG POO,I WOULD GIVE YOU MY COPY BUT I COULDN'T BEAR TO GIVE ANYONEA THING THIS BAD. THESE GUYS ARE NOT FUNNY! EVEN CARLINAND DANGERFIELD ARE FLAT. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.
5,Terrific Information and Recipes,"I am Indonesian but grew up in the United States. It has been difficult for me to collect information, history and recipes from my native homeland, but I was so thrilled when I found this book. Sri Own gives history, methods and classic recipes that I remember my mother and family cooking for me as a kid. I wish that more people, Indonesians as well, would value the richness of the food, culture and culinary possiblibites and potential that Indonesian food has to offer."
5,"If only one will do, this is a great pick.","This book is a comprehensive guide to the preparation of Indonesian regional foods, as well as the culture, history, and ingredients that make the food distinctly Indonesian. Sri Owen covers internationally known favorites from every region, as well as local favorites you might know only from your family or your travels there (martabak!). I love the notes with anecdotes, history, and techniques preceding each recipe. And for non-Indos or those not familiar with Southeast Asian ingredients, the glossary of ingredients and techniques provides short descriptions with suggestions for substitutions, as well as scientific, Indonesian, and English names. This book is a much-used reference in my Indonesian cooking."
1,Between Boxwave and Palm's T3 styla,"I've used my T3 with a WIFI adapter for international travel and day to day richness. The T3 stylus differs from that used with other Palm Pilots'. Like the device, it expands. Boxwave's version does even more--it holds a small ballpoint pen tip for that critical written note. After years of MACs and BlackBerries, I've just gone back to the T3. It is a lightweight powerhouse that conveniently does what I need, quickly and with few mistakes. Old fingers still manage to print Graffix, reliably. The battery is long lived.While I'm at it, let me rave about Boxwave. This company has remarkably useful devices which can be used wherever you go. My favorites include charger/adapters which can be used in cars and plugs around the world. Boxwave's designs are smart, prices are reasonable, they take up little space, and hold up well.Good company."
3,Rosa,"The book is well written, but the cast of characters makes it hard to follow at times. the plot is fine aand the ending even better."
1,Rosa,This was sent then returned and the same thing sent again. It was listed under audible but it could not be used in my car because it was formatted for Ipod use.
5,An excellent resource for future flight attendants!,"Having been a part of flight attendant training for some time now, this book is one of the best no-nonsense resources I have read. Although the information is particularly US-based, it is easily adapted to wherever you may want to join an airline as a professional in the air. A must before you think of attending an interview!"
4,A realistic view of the hiring process,I purchased this book with some doubt. Once I read it I realized how different a flight attendant interview is. I felt preapred and was given a job offer after just one interview. I am now close to celebrating my first year on the job with a major carrier.
4,One of the better resources for would-be trolley-dollies.,"Reading at least one such book is essential prior to interviewing with the airlines. The reference guide is very complete although the job description is not detailed enough. Considering your odds of getting hired are roughly 1 in 400, I think this guide is a worthwhile investment."
3,Starts out strong but a rush to the finish,"This book started out strong and the storyline caught my interest so that I read it right to the end to see what happened. Unfortunately, while the characters and plot started out with a lot of depth and detail, as the book progressed into the second half a lot of detail and depth was left out. Implausible ""coincidence"" elements were added to the story it seemed just to make the plot work out the way the author planned and the story line lost all depth. It comes across like the author was struggling for a deadline or just realized that she'd reached the limit of number of pages. A shame because the story that could have been developed would have been worth the extra length and would not have left such a disappointed feeling upon finishing the book."
5,Loved It!,This is probably the best book I have read all year. There were so many twists and turns I had no idea what would happen to Fiona. The size of the book may be large but it is a must read.
5,the tea rose,Excellent book with very interesting characters. I enjoyed following their lives from London to America. Can't wait to read The Winter Rose.
4,a great read,"enjoyed this very much,plenty of change in tempo, engaged right to the last page going to get the next book"
3,"Nice story, but not for me","The Tea Rose had a nice storyline, but it was not for me. I enjoyed the Jack the Ripper subplot and even the highly improbable brother subplot (no spoilers here!), but I couldn't connect with the main characters. I felt that for being historical fiction, Fiona acted like a modern girl (and there is nothing wrong with that), which made the historical setting seem...less historical. I also wasn't taken by the romance. To me, it seemed more like an obsession.It was well written and I enjoyed all the different personalities in this book. I won't be reading this again, but I would recommend it :)"
4,The Tea Rose,"Only 50% of the way through, but really enjoying The Tea Rose. Great twists and turns, and really good character developement"
3,Historical Saga - Sometimes Silly,"I enjoyed the whole sweeping historical saga feel of this book and the writing and research was excellent. But some of the story line was contrived and silly. ""Spoiler!"" the 4th or 5th time Fiona and Joe just miss reuniting through mishap or misunderstanding was so annoying! And the final reconciliation was nonclimactic and sort of unromantic. That said, I did enjoy the story and will give the sequel a chance."
4,Romance,Enjoyed reading about early London. Book takes a twist through misunderstandings but rights itself in end. Would recommend if you like this genre.
5,I NEVER CRY,"I never cry while reading. Well, never, until now. Donnelly had tears in my eyes by page 37. This book is what a novel should be."
3,A bit sappy and unrealistic,"I enjoyed parts of this book for the descriptions of London, New York and the excellent characterizations and dialogue. However, this book just didn't have enough tooth for me...parts of it were sappy and well...unbelievable. The kinda feeling I got was ""yeah, right"". If you want a decent beach read, that makes you feel good,this is it. I would not classify this as a page turner by any means. It is predictable and if Danielle Steel is your cup of ""tea"", you'll enjoy The Tea Rose."
2,Predictable and full of cliches,"Many readers have loved this book, but while I really cared for the protagonist, I found the story very predictable and full of cliches. It just seemed a little too familiar to me--""Young, hardworking girl endures a series of personal tragedies, yet through sheer grit and determination, works her way to the top of the (fill in the blank) trade, despite countless personal and professional obstacles along the way."" I guess this just wasn't my ""cuppa tea."""
3,Predictable beach novel,"The beginning of the book leads off with ""take you there"" descriptions of the slums of Victorian London. But shortly after, the novel descends to typical soap opera stuff. The book is long, over 500 pages, but by page 200, I had predicted 90% of the remainder of the book.Most of the events just happen to coordinate so perfectly that I was rolling my eyes throughout a large part of the book. And some of the assumptions (such as the identity of the bad guy) had me groaning out load.Nevertheless, the descriptions of the New York and London are good escapist fun. If you want to challenge your brain, read something else. If you'd like to escape and you're a fan of Danielle Steel, you'll enjoy this book."
1,Skip it,"The author used every cliche in the book. Characters designed for the movies. I could have written this myself, maybe better."
5,Why isn't this on the Bestseller list??,"Wow!! What a terrific novel! I happened to notice this book while shopping and just picked it up because I needed something to read. Once I started I couldn't put it down. Fiona Finnegan's tale will have you laughing, crying and cheering for the good guys from page one. After 700 pages, I still want more!"
1,DOPEY romance masquerading as historical novel,"Just because a writer places a tale in a particular historical period and cleverly incorporates a few real historical figures into the narrative does NOT QUALIFY IT AS AN HISTORICAL NOVEL! I admit I ""bought"" the tale up until the main character easily found passage to New York City with a total stranger. In terms of the realities of economics, class, and the true immigrant experience in America -- the character and her adventures couldn't be further from the truth and no more than a dopey fairy tale romance with so many unbelievable twists and turns one would have to be incredibly gullible to NOT find it outrageously ridiculous. Did I finish it? Only by quickly skim reading pages because I like to verify my judgment based on an entire book. Plus, I like to be able to show students what BAD story-telling looks like. Just because it's published doesn't make it a good story."
2,Tedious indeed,"After reading several really good Historical Fiction books of late I tried this book and was very disappointed. Another reviewer remarked on it being tedious and I must agree. I did not consider this historical fiction, rather it was a very predictable romance novel. If you like that kind of book then this book should be for you but if you are wanting something with much historical substance then this book is not for you. Serious Historical Fiction readers be warned; avoid this one."
3,A great beginning..but riddled with cliches,"I always love a big juicy read....old London, rags to riches..I am usually all over it, but the Tea Rose ended up feeling like a band-aid peeled off way-to-slow.We meet Fiona, as a young teenager in the 1880's. I could almost see old London in my mind, as the author did such a great job of painting a picture of the working class in this era. We soon follow Fiona to New York and this is where things get a bit tiresome.After 400 pages of ""near-misses"", and ""predictable coincedences"", I became a bit exausted of this book. (Really Ms. Connelly..Fiona invented tea bags and iced tea?)I did enjoy the happy ending..although it almost didnt happen..at least 50 different times."
5,This book is soooooooooo good.....,I enjoyed this book immensely...I recommended it to my book club...I hope they like it.The Winter Rose is the sequel....it is a wonderful read as well.ENJOY!!
4,Pretty good,"I enjoyed this novel very much. But I found the beginning a bit slow and really depressing. It definitely picked up in ""Part 2."" Some parts did drag and I didn't fly through this book like I did others. I was getting very frustrated at the end of the story - the fact that Joe and Fiona kept missing each other by split seconds or that their families were purposely keeping them apart was irritating after the few few times it happened. A couple of big surprises at the end that I wasn't expecting, both shocking. All in all, a very good read but took a while for me to really get involved in the story."
2,Difficult to complete,"I found the book difficult to finish, dragging on and on, with unremarkable writing. The dialogue was boring and tiresome for the most part."
2,tea rose.,its well written my 95 year old mum loved it. for me it did not have enough substance it was predicable no surprises no nail bitting anticapation.
2,Fun read,"After reading all of the rave reviews of this book on amazon (best book I've ever read, etc), I ordered this book. I was expecting at least a ""book club"" level of read from this book. It was a ""Romance Novel"". That's all fine and good if that is the genre you enjoy, but just keep that in mind when deciding to purchase. I enjoyed the read, but it fell short of my expectations in the literary sense - more of a beach read."
2,The Tea Rose,"I expected to read a historical novel about the Irish in New York. What it delivered was a Irish lass who always manages to be saved by a handsome rich man. Then I am to believe what a strong, iron willed female she is - my strong, ironwilled Irish mother didn't raise me to believe in anyone but ME. This novel is dribble."
2,"Extremely Well Written, but Morally Bamkrupt","An incredibly well crafted epic tale filled with extreme heartaches, soaring loves, rags to riches, rising above the saddest of beginnings.... But be warned this book is morally bankrupt -- even in the twists of the ending. The characters have much contempt for God in their lives because of sadness and tragedy, in spite of being ultimately blessed beyond belief. Would give it 5 stars for a moving (and often even inspiring) read, but was forced to deduct heavily for the lack of values."
4,"Well written, and a great story","I loved reading this book. Besides the obvious romance, there is action, mystery, heartache, and heartbreak. This book was very well written. There were a lot of surprises, and the parts that were predictable, just made you want to read more to see how the characters could untangle themselves.The characters were well defined. You felt like you actually knew them and could sympathize with them. I also loved that this was the first book in a trilogy,while this one was my favorite of the three, the other two are worth reading as well."
4,Tea rose,"I like the book, and the ease of purchase; however, I would like it to be on my Kindle and my iPad. Is that possible?"
4,Great Book,"I bought this book since it was listed as a special price and what a surprise. It was a wonderful story! I enjoyed it so much that I bought the sequel book, The Winter Rose. I strongly suggest reading both books."
5,Wonderful book,This book was chosen for a new book club I recently joined. I loved the book - the story captivated me. The author is wonderful and I have even ordered the next book in the trilogy! Hope we hear more from Jennifer Donnelly. She is a treasure to the writing world!
5,FANTASTIC!,"I just finished The Tea Rose and I just inhaled the story! Great characters, wonderful stories intertwined, and I fell in love with Fiona. I am so glad I have The Winter Rose right here beside me to start next! Thank you Ms. Donnelly for a wonderful read!"
5,AN AMAZING HISTORICAL NOVEL,"Could not put this rags to riches novel down and am now a devoted fan of writer Jennifer Donnelly. From Fiona Finnigan's dreams while working in a tea factory to her struggles to fulfill this dream and her never-ending love with Joe Bristow, interrupted by marriages by both, her flee to America and her determination to escape the hardships of their life in Ireland, become successful and then return to her homeland.If you loved A Woman of Substance, Forever Amber, or any books by Penny Vincenzi or Cathy Kelly, you'll marvel over this amazing read. Half way through, I knew I had to order The Winter Rose, a sequel to The Tea Rose and was not disappointed again! Would love to see this become a trilogy!! This book will be passed on to my best friends to read, but returned to my bookshelf, which only holds my favoritesI prefer to send in a rating when a book is one I can't put down and the characters will be felt and remembered....THIS IS A CLASSIC!"
1,This is ATROCIOUS!!!!,"Yuck, this is the worst collection of songs/videos ever released! It's truly piercing to the eyes and ears!! When will be rid of this talentless poser, claiming to be a punk rocker when she in fact is 1000 times more fabricated than Britney Spears!! Throw this load of crap in the garbage and be rid of this atrocity once and for all!!!!!"
4,Sarah's review,My frends have seen this nd they say it's brilliant nd recommend it to anyone. I havent as i dont live in america nd it costs to much.
5,Confirms my experience,I have been a Tibetan Buddhist for 25 years and I have lived through all the upheaval described in this book that caused a parallel upheaval in our local Buddhist centre. I enjoyed this book a great deal because it confirmed everything I knew about the conflict. So I have no real reason to doubt the authenticity of the rest of the book.
3,An elegant attemp to DECEIVE uninformed people,"""The Dance of 17 Lives"" is a very interesting phenomena: crafted in a fine ""journalist-alike style"" pretends to be a fair and balanced overview of the Karmapa Issue, but, reading well and being aware of the real facts, one can find an heavy amount of ""hopefully naive"" inaccuracies, strangely unnatural exclusion of all the main argumentations, legal victories and views from one of the sides of the controversy and a worrisome amount of facts that are proven to have never happened. It's very interesting the fact that the international - KARMAPA-ISSUE dot ORG - website is publishing a full point-by-point serie of detailed responses to Brown's book, I warmly suggest everyone to check them along with the book, it surely is a very interesting way to build up a fair point of view over the Issue :)"
1,kagyu review,"fellow kagyu brothers: please read rogues in robes, by tomek lehnert before buying. karmapachenno."
1,Impossible,"I do think this movie was well written. But if youve ever read the story of O you would know that this senario is impossible. It couldnt have happened. In the end Sir Stephen left her. In this movie he is with her again. Like I said, impossible. I would watch it again if only to understand the complexities of D/s . This film is in french with english subtitles. now they do speak some english in it but I found it very hard to understand what was being said. I wish the whole thing, even the english, would have been subtitled."
2,Quality issues,"Vinyl seems of decent quality and the zipper seems fine as well. However, the stitching that holds one of the rods that give it shape came out on the 2nd use. Quality could definitely be better, but for now it still works."
2,Needs to come with instructions,"You need to place it so the zipper starts in the middle of the top. If you trying to put it on placing the zipper on the side like the picture implies, you will end of tearing it like I did. Once in place, it provides adequate weather protection. The vinyl is somewhat thin, which also contributed to it tearing."
1,"ANOTHER GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR, !!!!","SOMEDAY I WILL LEARN, HA !!! VERY WEAK MATERIAL AND VERY BAD ZIPPER !!! SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BUY SOMETHING BETTER THAN THIS !!! DID NOT LAST 3 WEEKS !!!"
3,18th Emergency,This story is about a boy who loves making little notes onthings. One day he writes a note on a science poster about ealyman. He puts the name of the school bully with an arrow pointing to the neanderthal man. The school bully was right behind him and saw him write it! He runs from the bully throughout the story and... well you can find out for yourself. END
2,"OK, very predictable.","I recently read this book, and it is a good story. The plot is very simple, therefore the author, Betsy Byars, has to ramble on about unneeded information and go on into different boring things. It has an interesting twist with the different emergencies Mouse's friend had made up, but besides that and the always exciting plot of a typical nerd being chased by a huge, dumb bully the book is just okay."
2,Bold but Boring,The 18th Emergency had bold and interesting characters. I liked how the author expressed the characteristic traits through metaphors and simlies. The author also did a nice job relateing the charaters to a real life. The problem with the book was it was to predictable and not as exciting as I hoped it would be.
5,a triumph,"Watch this movie, soak in the lush forests and beautiful landscapes. Follow the life of the greatest germanic hero Siegfried as he surrenders the hort to the poor citizens of Worms and cry when he is betrayed and brutally killed - remember that no good deed goes unpunished.Die Nibelungen, and especially Siegfried, is one of my favorite movies. Some of you may laugh but Lord of the Rings doesn't come close to Fritz Lang's breath taking masterpiece. Truly a story that sparks something wonderful in the dark human soul. You can almost hear the gutteral strains of beerhall songs at oktoberfest and witness the mad nazi propoganda of the 20's and 30's.Do yourself a favour and purchase this movie."
2,Just ok,"This cake came out of the oven smelling and looking great. I let it cool on a cooling rack for 20 minutes before removing it from the pan and it shrunk considerably! The cake had a totally wonky appearance after it shrank, no longer a proper circle and the top was slightly uneven and a large crack formed in the top. I ended up cutting the edges off to make it a true circle and piled on the ganache to even out the top and fill the crack. After that it looked ok, but the cake was very dense (make sure you've got plenty of milk) and lacked a very strong chocolatey flavor. The ganache frosting was good, but that seemed to be the best thing about the cake. I won't buy this again."
1,Very dissapointed,"I made this for Christmas dessert. It smelled wonderful when I made it and baked very well. The ganache was easy to make, but...... it lacked any flavor. The cake and the ganache was very bland and tasteless. Could not eat it. DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. What a disappointment."
4,Pretty good mix,No idea what the previous reviewer was talking about. This was delicious! My 2 kids and husband finished half the cake in 15 minutes. As I was putting the cake together - I had my doubts -- the batter didn't taste that great. But when it was finished and I poured the ganache on top - wow! It was pretty good for a mix.
5,"Great information. Well written, but not an easy read for most.",Great information in this book. It is very well written. Would be very challenging for the young and some intermediate in their faith.
4,Truth Aflame:Theology for the Church in Renewal,"The book is balanced and very easy to understand. I enjoyed reading it. The book has helped me to appreciate systematic theology and has helped me to understand why(Biblical) theology is essential. The pages of the book seem to come loose easily though, I believe that has to do with the binding of the book pages. The publisher might want to find another method of binding the pages together."
3,weak life-expectancy/hard to find replacement,"I loved the idea of this product-it was the best gift that I received, being I sanitize my families toothbrushes every few days,which can be tedious.(of course, you still must take the unit apart and sanitize it at least 1x a week.)Unfortunatley, within a few months,the light stopped working, and being it takes an unusual bulb, I cannot seem to find a replacement.Thanks to other reviews, I am realizing this is not an unusual occurrence, meanwhile, I guess it's back to boiling in tea-tree oil and peroxide."
5,Couldn't know how much I'd love this,"I bought this as a gift and kept it for myself. I enjoy knowing that my husband and I sanitize our brushes daily. No colds,no flu. Awsome."
1,Not very reliable,I purchased my VIOLight the beginning of December and it is already not working properly. It will turn on but does not turn off on its own (which it is supposed to do). As a result of it not turning off the power supply cord gets very hot (fire hazard) and I have to unplug the unit to turn it off.VIOlight Countertop 4 Brush UV Toothbrush Sanitizer
2,"OK product, but not at this price",My wife found this product at a liquidation store for less than $10 around 3yrs ago. She got one for me and one for our adult daughter. Both are still working however one developed a balky switch after a couple of years so that it takes several pushes of the button to activate the device. The two star rating was based on the overall quality at the Amazon price. This is a perfectly acceptable device at $10 but at $50 I would be very disappointed in the build quality. I will leave the debate over efficacy to others.
1,"Mold grew in the ""Sanitizing"" device!","Used this product for a few months and just assumed it was working. Then one night my husband took a close look at his toothbrush and there was mold on the end of it. When we examined the inside of the Sanitizer closely we found that there was a variety of gunk, mold etc inside. If these things can grow right next to the bulb how much do you think it is doing for your toothbrush?"
2,Price and Value,This product is priced by the market and is not not priced by the technology it uses (research and development) or actual components which make it up. Materials and labor cost approx. $5.00 so what constitutes a $50.00 price tag? Is it the value of aesthetics (packaging)or the value of piece of mind (bacteria BE GONE)that sells this product when many other products or practices do the same thing? Perhaps it is the cost of shipping junky little consumables around and around the globe that constitutes $50.00. Either way the mark up on this product is grossly high and other lower cost products should be sought after if this is your preferred method of sterilization (that being an old but effective method of UV light). So if you have expendable income then why not donate it the CEO of a NOT so local manufacturer abroad? You will have a clean mouth and they will have your money.
1,VIOlight = waste your money,Don't buy this crap. I don't think it sanitizes the toothbrush. There is NO FDA registered and or UL approved. The unit itself does NOT LAST LONG too. I don't understand why this crap still sell in here ???
1,Feedback re: AsSeenonTVGuys,"This review is specific to this seller, AsSeenonTVGuys. I've purchased from a number of Amazon merchants without a problem. That wasn't the case with AsSeenonTVGuys. The product was poorly packed and stopped working after a few weeks. I emailed them about an exchange and they directed me to the Violight customer since it's under warranty. There's nothing explicitly wrong with this--I'm sure it's all spelled out in their policies. But is is a far cry from other Amazon marketplace experiences I've had. If you plan to buy from them, make sure you've read their fine print and are comfortable with it *before* you purchase."
1,Think about it a minute. These are absolutely useless products.,"Who would actually think such a gizmo is even useful if it DID do what it claims?(1) Anything that gets on your toothbrush head was ALREADY in your mouth. Unless you think your houseguests are cleaning their shoe soles with your toothbrush while you aren't looking.(2) You are sitting a wet toothbrush head upside down in this gizmo. Which means it is sitting in a puddle of water that is likely to mold/mildew. So you can put mold/mildew INTO your mouth (that was NOT in your mouth before).(3) The puddle of water is likely to (a) rust out the innards of this gizmo and (b) short-circuit the gizmo's electronics.(4) The American Dental Association says these gizmos have no proven beneficial health benefits:[...]Given all that, it seems your money would be better spent betting ""Hard 8"" at the Craps table in Vegas."
1,"UV toothbrush sanitizer only works on surfaces exposed to the light. If you cut the toothbrush head in half, you'll see the ligh","UV toothbrush sanitizer only works on surfaces exposed to the light. If you cut the toothbrush head in half, you'll see the light does not kill anything hiding inside the mechanical head. The toothbrush must be submersed in a Listerene type product."
4,Peace of Mind,This is a great product about $100 cheaper than steam sanitizers. Works as stated and accepts electric toothbrush heads although they can sit a little low. Looks great on the counter.
2,REPLACEMENT BULB EXPENSIVE!,"I think this item is overpriced to begin with, though was ok for awhile. When the bulb suddenly quit working, I went looking for a replacement. No one locally carries these, so I ordered one through Amazon for way too much for a light bulb, and the worst part... IT DIDN'T EVEN WORK, though it was supposedly the ""right one"" and looked like the one that came out of the unit so I don't know if the unit itself just died (I think we had about 2 years when it did) or their replacement bulbs are worthless, but either way, I'm looking for something new!"
3,Good with a little room for improvement,"The toothbrush sanitizer seems to work well, but could stand improving. Thereis no cover (or lid) for the unit, so why bother to sanitize if your toothbrushremains ""open"" to dust, etc? I went to the hardware store and purchased a plasticcover that sits over the toothbrush area, but would definitely recommend that atight-fitting cover be included with the unit."
3,Violight Toothbrush Sanitizer,"I'm not quite sure what I was expecting, however had I paid full price for this item, I would have been annoyed. Luckily, I had a $20 coupon, so $30 seemed more reasonable for what it is worth. I can't scientifically tell you if it works, however at least some sort of sanitizer is better than the nothing we had before."
1,Piece of junk,Bought this item in January and around June I had to start jiggling the power cord to make it work and now it is September and it has stopped working completely.
1,Poor design; waste of $$,"It seemed like a good idea. wish i'd saved my money. Within 2 weeks, the holder had black mold or mildew in it. We live in Dallas - it's certainly not from ambient humidity. it comes apart and the little cup comes out for cleaning, but you can't clean this out. not even a bottlebrush gets into the crevices."
1,BEWARE!!!!!,"I purchased this product 6 months ago. Since then, it has quit working. I think the light is burned out, since there doesn't appear to be anything wrong with the cord. I can't find a place to by a replacement bulb, but....it shouldn't have burned out that fast in the first place. Based on my experience I give this product a big fat ""Goose Egg:!!!"
2,"Bad customer service, poor product","I bought this more than a year ago and I had it replaced once. I tried to get it replaced again, and the customer strongly suggests that you buy a new bulb. I've bought a new bulb twice so far, and they still want you to buy a new bulb even after I've sent them an email to have my unit replaced.However, I ran into another roadblock, because on their website, they advertise a 2 year warranty. When I tried to claim it, customer service told me that the customer was supposed to buy it at the time of purchase. Sounds like false advertising to me.I've exchanged several emails with them, but to no avail.1 star for lasting <12 months, and it looks nice on the counter top.1 star for first time replacement. They sent in a replacement unit right away.After that, they don't care about you, nor do they care to help you.I would rather buy something to keep my toothbrushes up, and boil them once in awhile."
3,Great until on/off button rots/fails: on our 4th (and last) as result,"This is great idea: more than one brush or flosser can be sanitized at same time. However, we've had to replace it about every year due to the deterioration of the on/off power button and connection. You'd think that after creating a good product, the manufacturer would see that it has a decent use life. We've had to replace the whole unit even before the bulb wore out. We may switch to using the battery powered individual type if this one goes too quickly."
1,worked for about 2 weeks,The item worked perfectly for about 2 weeks. I have purchased 3 of these in the past (one was a gift) and I really like them. This one is defective.
2,A junky mess.,"The translucent cap on top began to crack almost immediately, even though it did not take any sort of abuse. In short order it was shattered and crumbling in to many pieces. The violight is also difficult to keep clean, so the crumbling combined with the build-up of toothpaste scum makes it look like a piece of junk. Without the top to hold the brushes, the violight is nearly useless."
3,A good book with interesting photos and drawings.,"This is a good book about WWII at sea. It misses being a great book. I found so many typing mistakes, errors of fact, and mislabled photos that I wondered if anyone did any proof reading before it was printed. I expected more for the price. While good, it is no where near the quality of Jane's Fighting Ships of WWII."
5,Basset hound mystery at Lake Tahoe - Sirius About Murder,"I liked it as much as the first one, Howling Bloody Murder. I enjoy the Lake Tahoe area, bassets and mysteries so what could be better! Hope there's a third one!"
3,a bit revisionist of marine history,begins with wwii works forward. has many of the standard historical errrors of the tet and misses most of the final victories in the late sixties.
5,One of the Great WORLD Films,"They say that European and Asian films are character-driven, while American films are plot-driven. L.A. Confidential has both great character studies and a wonderful plot. Add to this production values that are American films' forte, and you have a world-class masterpiece.One sour grapes note: To those who share my chagrin over L.A. Confidential's loss to the trash called Titanic, take comfort. In 1952, another mediocre spectacle film, Greatest Show on Earth, by a director with powerful backing, DeMille, beat out a future classic called High Noon, directed by a director of lesser ""stature"". James ""I am king of the world!"" Cameron vs Curtis Hanson. The parallels are striking.To me, its loss of the Oscar to Titanic reflects not on L. A. Confidential, but on the Academy. Actors are notoriously stupid. And since the Academy vote is dominated by actors, is it any wonder that the Oscar for Best Picture of 1997 was such a stupid award?"
4,"Great movie, average bluray","This is a great movie, a million times better than Titanic (which won Best Picture that year).But the review is for the blu-ray - solid picture quality, but not as stunning as some others I've seen. Recommended for $10-12, but not more."
4,Here for the voting,"Most people know what a good movie this is so who cares about my opinion.I have been a big Kevin Spacey fan since I first saw him as Mel Profit on ""Wise Guy"" talking to his big toes. That was a character. Kevin Spacey was my initial draw to this film and I like Kim Basinger and it looked like an interesting character for her to play.I enjoyed Russell Crowe and Guy Pearce very much, was surprised to find out they were from Australia and New Zealand and the rest is history."
3,Characters carry the film,"Strong characters carry this film - but perhaps this is not unexpected as the LA stories are for us today pretty typical. A good film that is worth seeing for Crowe's, Spacey's and De Vito's performances."
4,keep up,"this movie jumps around a fair bit.not really with the story,which is a pretty straight forward whodunnit,but with the characters themselves,esp bud white and jack vincennes.good for relaxing with a shootemup but also good for something more indepth if you've a mind.jack v's death scene alone is worth watching this for."
1,If this were the last movie on earth I still wouldnt want it,Judging from most of the other reviews I must be from another planet. I think that this movie has to be on of the WORST I have ever seen. I was bored to tears in the cinema. Kevin Spacey and some other actor playing some other character looked remarkably alike so I kept mixing them up and getting confused. This movie deserves no stars.
1,Another Hollywood Stinkeroo That Garners High Praise,"Why, oh why are people obsessed with promoting movies that depend more on vulgarity and sex than plot? Why do these movies never-the-less garner all sorts of critical acclaim? This seedy study of a creep cop and his slut girl had every cliche in the book, and every cuss word to boot. I think, gee, what would I rather watch? A masterpiece like Lillies of the Field or this LA Confidential garbage? Moral of story: I'll never be a Hollywood critic because I favor movies that lift the human spirit, not that show us what rotten scum we are underneath our veneer of civility. So be it. Please, Amazon, allow us to rate films with no stars."
1,This movie was a big bore.,I didn't like this one at all. I finally got up and ordered a pizza and returned later to see if it had gotten any better. It didn't. Kim bassinger is lifeless. She has been and always will be a lady totally bereft of any acting talent whose put on stage because she's ... and looks good in an evening gown. The whole story is really flat.
1,Read The Book,"I cannot stress enough to avoid this movie like the plague. I used to think it was a masterful piece of cinema. Then I read the book and everything changed. My problems with this movie are the same as any other Ellroy book to movie adaptations - stories and characters are rewritten without any consideration for how it affects the overall piece, casting is done without reading the characters descriptions, and the angst and misery of the main characters is never properly conveyed. Hopefully White Jazz can break the cycle, though I have very little hope."
1,Too Much Violence Against Women,"How much violence against women is too much? Rita Hayworth lookalike Susan Lefferts (Amber Smith) gets murdered. Veronica Lake lookalike Lynn Bracken (Kim Basinger) gets knocked around. A young girl gets raped and you have to watch her emotional pain afterwards as she's lying in a bed, bound and gagged, in silent agony, and a black man in another room is laughing.But all this is forgiven because the cops hate women-beaters and they're out to get the bad guys?"
5,Uniformly great,"Sun Tzu once said that ""strength everywhere is strong nowhere."" That's a good way to describe this movie. It is strong everywhere. You cannot point to casting, or directing, or acting, or writing, or cinematography, and say ""that's not as good as the rest."" It's uniformly great. Guy Pearce was fantastic in a definite breakout performance; Kevin Spacey was dead on and Russell Crowe was completely convincing as the muscle head with he heart of gold. See, there I go -- I can't criticize any of the actors relative to the others, they were all outstanding.Anyhow, buy this movie for your collection and you won't be disappointed. The DVD transfer on my copy was excellent, although I wish it had additional features. It's well worth full price. The movie even has a surprisingly high body count for action fans!"
4,Noir by Sunlight,"LA Confidential is still a fantastic balls to the wall movie that many of its participants will be hard pressed to equal the rest of their careers.This was the first movie I ever saw Russell Crowe or Guy Pearce in. Kevin Spacey as Jack Vincennes is the epitome of 50's cool without a conscience. The adaptation is fantastic, even though having read and loved the book I pine for even more Ellroyesque details.Most of all, taking a classic Noir story and telling it by the natural light of So Cal in the 50s creates a contrast that is intoxicating. Movies like this remind me how much I love movies.The extras are okay, but I would so love a commentary track on this movie."
3,"Good, but not really anything new","We have here a film that sadly, peaks early on. The cruel underbelly of 50's Los Angeles is refreshingly portrayed, but when that's done, the film has no place to go but a stereotypical ""it's-who-we-lease-expect-it-to-be"" revelation. Danny DeVito proves he's earned the right to appear onscreen with an amusing performance as a slimey reporter that manages not to drown us in cliches. Kim Basinger has a certain depth, but not enough to mask her relative unimportance to the plot (we know she's a hooker early on, and who she works for--no real surprises). But the film's best asset is Kevin Spacey, the only character with more than one side to him, and when he exits from the film there's a gaping hole. On to the shoot-out and wrap-up. Besides, is anyone out there suprised that L.A. isn't all it's cracked up to be?"
3,Not as good as I expected.....,"I was told by my friends this movie is even better than Chinatown, but I was disappointed. Not that the movie is bad, but it's just beyond compare to Chinatown. LA Confidential is just like one episode from 'the untoucheables', while Chinatown carries much deeper meanings to Power, Corruption & Evil, not your usual gangster/cops movie. If you have not seen Chinatown, rent or buy one. You won't regret it."
5,LA Confidential DVD,"Very good movie, great cast, believable setting. Obtained movie through Amazon.com, can't praise them enough for their customer service. If I had a business that worked as hard as they do to provide customer enjoyment I would be proud."
5,"If it hadn't been for Titanic, it would've gotten Best Pic","I had just finished Ellroy's novel and wanted to watch the film. I was surprised at how much faster it moved and also how much better it was. The screenwriters did a brilliant adaption of the story. This film should have won all the nominations in 1997, but Titanic couldn't allow it! Anyhow, I highly reccomend this and urge you to put it in your shopping cart right now!!!"
4,Always enjoyable to watch,"I always enjoy watching this movie. Russel Crowe, Kevin Spacey and particularly Guy Pearce do a remarkable job portraying various angles on the LA Police Department. As a ""period piece"" it doesn't give you quite the nostalgic feel as does, say ""Chinatown."" The story could be told just as well if set in today as in the '50's. It's a story of what it takes to get ""justice"" for a night-club shooting that shows there's more to it than what we're first shown. The seemingly separate stories of these three cops slowly come together as they investigate their own individual crimes. And the climatic scene is one of the best of its type that I've seen in quite a while. It's still exciting to watch even after you know the outcome. It is one of the best movies of the late-nineties."
4,Noir For the Nineties Now In Blu-Ray!,I have always been a fan of noir from the early such asThe Maltese Falcon [Blu-ray] andDouble Indemnity (Universal Legacy Series)and the more recentChinatown (Special Collector's Edition)which this film closely resembles in some parts as it also addresses police corruption in California in the 1900s however this film is unique in and of itself. The casting of relative unknowns at the time was daring but it paid off with fine performances from Australians Guy Pierce and Russell Crowe. Kim Basinger fully deserved her Oscar for her work and special mention has to be made for James Cromwell's work too.As for the blu-ray itself while the picture and sound quality aren't reference-grade as far as the best I've ever seen in 1080p they are still very good and together with the excellent special feature documentaries does make this a great way to view a true film classic.Recommended for all fans of great film!
2,Love and hate,"I love this movie but hate the format. Have ordered twice now from sellers which advertised DVD as fullscreen. Both times turned ou to be letterbox, which I hate."
5,Great movie that deserved every accolade!!!,"The acting in this movie is superb, totally professional I couldn't fault ant member of the cast. Fast paced, I was totally caught up and caught up that I forgot that I was watching a movie and became immersed in the brilliantly written script. I found it impossible to single out a particular actor as each member"
5,The Best Movie of the 90's!,"This movie is the reason that I bought my DVD player. This was the best movie of the 90's. I still can't believe that TITANIC beat it.What I get to be the message of this movie is ""perception."" No one is who you think they are. Bud White is not just a thug with a badge. He actually has a brain. Exely is not as straight laced as he first appeared. Jack works for a television show, which is all lies played to be the truth. The idea of perception is best shown in the hookers who are ""cut"" to look like movie stars. They may look real, but they are not.Watch this movie and see how a movie is supposed to be made."
4,A Wonderful Movie!,"Sex, violence, and scandal all rolled up in one great story. A mystery and thriller, this movie is a joy to watch. Guy Pearce is the real star of this film. The only complaint is that there are too many important characters to keep track of and that confuses the story just a little."
5,Top Story of Los Angeles and the 1950s,"I was raised in Los Angeles during the 1950s and this is one of the very few movies that capture the look, feel, and character of the city at that time. The acting is stunning and the DVD transfer is razor sharp. Jerry Goldsmith's superb score terrific and the locations, particularly the ""Formosa Cafe"" and the Bunker Hill area flop houses are particularly authentic. What I have to say about this great film has been said by the many reviews here already. I wanted to add that this gem is brilliantly adapted from the great novel it came from with awesome authenticity. Intricate, brilliant, action-packed and mysterious all at the same time. An easy five stars!!"
2,"Good Cop, Bad Cop, Carnage and Mayhem","Essentially a prime time television cop show, except with period cars and telephones. Lots of shooting and fisticuffs. The fellow who plays the Irish police captain knows how to act (or perhaps he just has better dialogue), and I suppose it's better than most contemporary Hollywood films. I'd give it two and a half stars if I could."
1,Movie that didnt work,"When i got my movie, which i had to wait extra time to get, it wouldn't work....it was coded for another country or region! I live in the us of a and they send me the wrong one anyway! Not happy at all"
1,What was all the hype about?,"Not sure why this film won 2 Oscars and was nominated for 7. I thought the acting was sub-par and the storyline was trite but to each their own, right?"
2,overrated,it was bad enough that Kim Basinger got awards but then Kevin Spacey gets alot of juice as well.now Spacey is talented but this film is overrated from jump.it goes into to many directions without focus.
2,Highly disappointed.,"Having never seen this film at the time of its release, I was very eager to view the DVD based on the rave reviews and spectacular cast. As the plot unwound, I became particularly disappointed in the lack of depth of the characters, the trite dialogue, and the predictability of the story (Guess what, there's a shoot-out at the end). The only element of the film worthy of praise was the performance by Guy Pierce (his character predictably torn between a squeaky-clean image and the corruption and violence around him). The dismal script can summarized in the deadpan voice from another lackluster Kim Bassinger performance, ""Some guys get the world, and others get the ex-hooker and a trip to Arizona."""
2,"Perfectly Okay, No More","A good enough little movie. Perfectly adequate in all ways, except for the utter tedium that sets in whenever Kevin Spacey appears on screen. Strange that this has become acclaimed as some sort of masterpiece. I can't agree. It is merely an amusing little movie that entertains for a couple of hours. Sad that that is enough, in the late 1990s, to confer classic status on a movie."
2,Just couldn't get into it.,I know this movie was very high ratings and I am a minority on this... but the wife and I rented this for the first time through Amazon and just could not get into the movie.
2,Froze during streaming,I was so happy to find this movie to stream because I needed it for a school project. I streamed it and it seemed like every 5 mins the screen froze and I had to restart my computer and find my spot. It took forever to watch and changed the configuration on my tv. I never had that happen when I used Netflix but then again Netflix didn't offer the movie by steaming. Stuck with freezing.
3,G I A N T S!,"The most impressing thing about this movie is that it contains a big number of GIANT actors: Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe, Kim Basinger, Danny Devito and Guy Pearce.The film takes place in the 1940s about the power of individuals in the police, politics and press that was corrupted by scandals, betrayals, and sex!The violance and action are good. And the ending was a SMASH HIT! But the movie was put together in a complicated way that it is full of fast events with many characters that sometime you find hard to catch up with! After you watch the movie, you know it was good but you might need to watch it again to get a better picture and understand it more!"
4,Interesting,"I'd heard stories about the Hollywood police department in the early to mid-1900s, so when this movie came out I wanted to see it. The acting is good and the story line is interesting. Overall, a pretty good movie."
5,A Gripping movie,"This movie is made briliantly. Technically, this movie stands out. The direction is good, Music is Great , editing wonderful and the cast's Acting is superb(though I did not really think Kim Bassinger was worth the Oscar). The DVD quality is one of the very best. This is a serious type of movie and a must see if you do not despise serious movies."
5,A DVD Essential,"This is one DVD title that belongs in everyone's collection. Never mind the naysayers, this was the best picture in the year of that big boat. The acting is sensational--esp. Spacey's and Crowe's In my mind, the image of Bud White hanging the dirty DA out of his office window is a classic. The extras on the DVD are great, and there is nothing like wide screen. Buy this movie and enjoy!!"
5,The bad apples are full of it.,"Ok so I read through all the reviews on this guitar before I ordered it and was amazed at how some people rated it so low, they obviously were expecting a Gibson or or higher order of guitar. Mine so far appears to be fine...its holding tune, the tone is very nice and loud. The body is solidly made and the finish is excellent, Yes it will need better strings as most guitars do and well for you Guitar Geschtoppo Nuts out there as with anyone else its a matter of preference and taste in the brand and style of string you put on you guitar. Also I tested the electronic tuner against electronic tones and it worked exactly as it should have and didnt get effected much by background noise. So for all you beginners out there this is a perfect model to start out on for a darned good price."
1,Not worth the price,I bought this guitar for my dad as a starter guitar and was very disappointed. Very hard to tune....For a few more bucks I could have gotten a different brand. Not worth the extra stuff they added to it...If I could return it I will...Dont buy...
5,Great Guitar,"It is a wonderful instrument, my 11-year-old daughter loves it, she is playing it every single day. I'm glad I got it!"
3,"good, not great","everything is perfect, except the high E string. pressing on the 1st or 2nd fret causes the 3rd fret is being played. i guess something is a little off."
1,Save your money!!,I bought this guitar for my son for Christmas and it is now August and the guitar is coming unglued. He has taken very good care of the guitar. He puts it back in the case and sets it on the stand when not it use. He got it out of the case today to play and was in tears because the glue had come on undone where the strings are attached to the guitar. I would definately save your money and put it toward a more expensive guitar which we now have to go buy.
4,First acoustic,"I had been searching garage sales and ads for my 1st acoustic guitar when I came across this on Amazon. Brand new, with a tuner & bag - All at price I was willing to pay for a beat up something or other. Seems like a ""no-brainer"" to me.!It's packed nicely for shipping, the tuner works well(like it better than the one I was using on my electrics), the guitar sounds terrific & has very nice action.The bag is a little cheesy, but uhm, at this price something's gotta give - I vote the bag, how about you? I'll probably replace the strings, but no reason to hurry, really.The one feature that I should have noticed but overlooked is that with out the cut-out, my fingers will never reach the last 4 frets. I'll worry about that when I'm good enough to justify spending more later. For now, this is a fine guitar for what I needed, something to explore and practice with."
1,Hard to tune and one of the strings broken when I tune,"When I get the package I was so excited, and the guitar is pretty nice. When I was tring to tune the string, one of them is really hard to tune and the 3rd sting was broken when I tune the string!!!!! That is so unusual, buecause I bought guitar before and this sistuation never happend. I hope the seller could contact me ASAP and tell me what should I do right now!"
1,You get what you pay for,Absolute garbage. If you want a product that will be good even when you reach intermediate levels and is still cheap I would recommend an epiphone. Believe me I've played guitar for some time now. A bad instrument can be very discouraging to beginners.
2,Not Worth It,I purchased this guitar to learn how to play . The poor quality made that difficult. Guitar will not tune easily or stay tuned for long.The tuner that comes with it does not work properly. Save yourself the headache and buy better quality.
4,very nice looking guitar,I bought this guitar for my husband because he wanted to learn how to play. It's a very nice looking guitar and the neck on it is the perfect length for people who really don't have long arms. It would have been great if an instructional DVD or video came with it. Overall it's a pretty nice guitar for the price.
4,Great guitar,"Prior to this purchase, I have never bought or played a guitar in my life. I bought this one to teach myself. I am pleased. My friend who lives abroad and who is an accomplished classical guitarist, said it is a very good guitar to play on. He recommends that I care for it during my lessons and keep it for a long time. It is durable."
1,Should not have bought cartridge from Inkers,"Bought the ""refurb"" from Inkers. Mistake. Doesn't work at all. Maybe instead of buying lexmark's &*#(@! cartridge, I'll find a printer whose manufacturer doesn't lock out other toner cartridges (if one exists these days...)."
3,Beware the region chip!!!!,"This is a run of the mill cartridge for a cheap printer with a significant flaw (by design). These come from Lexmark with a chip in them that controls lots of stuff like locking it down when it says there is insufficient toner left (even though your prints are still fine). It should be up to the user to develop streaky prints if they want to or need to. If you are running low on toner, you would often want to complete a print run before running out to get a new cartridge.The second annoying thing is that the chip is encoded for a region (like DVDs). This means that it will not work in Europe if bought in America. I bought one for my mum in the UK and it has caused all kinds of problems. I don't know if refinished cartridges have the same restrictions. It makes me want to avoid all Lexmark printers in the future. No wonder they are cheap; they are trying to screw you on the consumables - razors and razor blades..."
5,Works Great at a Great Price !,"Always glad to get a new cartridge when the old one is going too light. This return program is great, because I don't feel like I am wasting the old cartridge and they make it easy by sending the return package of stuff along with the new cartridge. It was one of the best prices we found!"
2,Not worth the trouble,This product doesn't last as long as the brand-name one. It also arrived with black toner spilled all over the inside of the box.
5,where is my book?,"I never got this book, I keep receiving emails for ""order update"" where I am asked to confirm my order delay.I expect this book to be great, but where is it?"
3,"fun, but could b improved","agree w/ the other reviews written except that this is a fun toy. even though the sound is a bit muffled and the on/off swith is placed in an odd place, kiddos do enjoy playing w/ this toy."
1,DISAPPOINTMENT,"I purchased this product for my 10-month old along with several other musical toys. While I like the concept of a ""guitar""-shaped musical toy combined with a pull-toy, this product compares very poorly with the others I purchased.The primary problem is that the speaker is on the bottom of the toy. This gives very little volume to the music and it also sounds very muffled. In my opinion, the designer didn't give much credit to actually HOW the music sounds.We've played with this toy maybe twice. My frustration with it grows higher every time I pull it out. It was a waste of my money.Stick with Leapfrog products. They're great!"
2,sound is poor,I was convinced the first item I had received was defective and got a replacement only to find the sound was terrible on the new one too. I am very disappointed in the quality of this toy. On the bright side....A+ to Amazon for a speedy exchange. Great customer service :)
5,Impressed!,"My little one loved all the lights and sounds this toy has and now, years later, my new little ones love it as well. This toy also has great durability, my older kids have given 'wagon' rides to the 18 month old around the house and it is still in perfect shape!"
2,Son loves it - I don't,"My son got this for his first birthday from one of his aunt's. He has gotten a good amount of fun out of it. However, as a Mom, I haven't enjoyed this toy. It goes through batteries like crazy. It also rolls much too fast that he's had many falling incidents. Worst of all, I hate the handle. he likes to pull it over and either slams himself in the head with it, or leans on it causing the body to flip and hurt him. I ended up taking this away and hiding it as I found he was injuring himself with this way too much. The fun he has isn't worth it."
2,Overrated,"Watching this depressing movie was almost as bad as going through the Hurricane Sandy. For some unknown reason a young married woman decides on having an affair. The scenes are LONG and drawn out. You watch her driving around town for several minutes on the way to the hotel they go to. Why?There was one funny part of the movie. At one point when the female star is somewhere in Arabia with her lover, she is offered earrings that match the color of her eyes. For 2 hours I had been wondering what color her eyes were. She constantly wears so much black eyeliner her eyes look clownish, or more accurately described as goulish.Unappealing and unattractive actors. Yuk. Waste of time and a waste of a move."
3,Italiain,It was sort of aboring at times and even dull while the blond lady and the married man were out meating to cheat on their significant others.
3,"A grounded, realistic movie exploring the temptations and consequences of infidelity","A film about the temptations and consequences of infidelity which feels much more real and grounded that would be found in a typical Hollywood treatment. As well presented as it is, though, the movie ultimately fails to deliver a story."
1,NOt worth the money,"This was not worth the money made no sense and was a waste of my time, bad bad bad and wish I did not spend the money"
1,Nothing special here except for the price,"This is a very expensive product that is not worth the exorbitant price. I tried it based on the glowing reviews seen below, but it cleaned no better than other, less expensive options. Only then did I realize that the reviews contained here may be scams. The histories of the Florida reviewers below show that they gave five stars to the whole Menscience product line, and little else. This is very suspicious to say the least. In my experience, this product did not lather well, did not have a pleasant scent, and only cleaned o.k. It left no residue, but one would expect that from this clear, liquidy soap. I would not buy it again."
5,good stuff,I bought this for my son and he is very pleased with it. better than other body washes he has tried
2,Overly vague...not quite intended for the absolute beginner,"Being new to oracle databases this book basically highlighted the new features of oracle 9i while attempting to provide a beginners overview of the Oracle database.The book also does not provide a download of the databases used in the code examples. As a true beginner, i would have liked to follow the code examples in the book, and try out SQL commands. This would have provided me a better understanding of what the author was explaining, as well as 'try out' the code examples.However, if you are seekeing OCP certification and have a fundamental understanding of SQL and databases this book may assist you with converting to the Oracle structure. I've read the whole book without any Oracle or database experience, and was able to gain a better grasp of the architecture during OCP training courses.As with all manuals i read there's always useful information contained within them, so i would not completely dismiss this book."
1,Piece of ...,"This book is a nothing but a piece of junk. It covers a lot of basic UNIMPORTANT details. It introduces you to all the different subjects from programming to configuring but doesn't include the information of HOW TO. All talk and no action. A TOTAL WASTE of my time, money and resources. I'm posting this review so in hoping that no one will waste their time and money on this piece of waste. DON'T BUY THIS BOOK!"
1,Don't buy This. Worst book I ever read!!!...,"Don't buy this book!!!It tries to cover everything, but it really covers nothing.The book is not organized in any way. It talks about a lot of things, but it doesn't really explain anything in detail. The book provides little bit of how-tos without ""any"" explanation.Once again, strongly recommend that you don't buy this book."
4,Incredible resource,What a great book from Jimmy Bruno and Mel Bay. Although some of the fingerings seem to be a little odd almost every page of this book is filled with useful information that I will use for years to come.Worth every penny!
2,Fienne's opinion on the,"This is an opinionated retelling of the experience of Captain Robert Scott's attempt to be the first to reach the South Pole. Although Mr. Fiennes has great experience as a Polar explorer in his own right, his claim to be the only author in a position to comment on Scott's decisions, does little to prove he is giving us an objective history of the expedition. Fiennes takes every opportunity to make Scott appear to be a selfless and overly self critical hero, interested primarily in scientific discovery, who was loved by all who are worthy, and has the sole claim to the greatest physical achievement in history. He makes Roald Amundsen out as a selfish, unpleasant, and dangerous man with no friends. Although it is an interesting point of view, it will not satisfy readers who are looking for objective history."
2,"Largely a static reading of the book, with songs.","This is not one of the animated Dr. Seuss episodes (such as The Cat in the Hat, The Lorax, and How the Grinch Stole Christmas) created by the Looney Tunes animators. This video is primarily a reading of the book illustrated mostly with stills from the book (which are either totally static or in some cases, panned to give the impression of animation.)So, if you're buying it for older kids or adults, I would recommend against it--it's not a very memorable experience. But, on the other hand, if you're buying it for a young child, I highly recommend it--my 3 year old daughter loves it!"
3,needs editing,"my son just loves ""there's a wocket in my pocket!"" and ""fox in socks"". he enjoys reading the books and it's a special treat to see the original illustrations animated. this video would be highly recommended except for the first story and title of the video ""the cat in the hat comes back"". i'm not for censorship but i wonder if words like ""kill"" should be part of our pre-schoolers vocabulary? and in our generation of gun problems, should we show our children guns? understandably, this was written in totally different times."
2,The condition of the book is not as it is described.,"The book is categorized as ""good"" condition, but when I received the book, it shocked me. It is far from be good at all. The cover is torn, and the worst of it is that most of the exercises has been marked with ""answers."" Such fact made the book ""useless"" for a student who is going to do the exercises."
4,Super Hero fun,"My son had requested super hero figures for Christmas. These are very durable and have stands to store them on. However, the stands have two pegs and the figures only have a hole in one foot so they are not very stable on the stand. Overall, it is a great product."
1,RIP OFF !!!!,"I was going to buy this, but since two classic shorts aren't included I won't buy this!!!Hey Warner Brothers, how does it feel to lose money being PC???I gave this rating One because they didn't have zero!"
3,Three strikes and Warners is out...,"Strange that when you insert each disc in this collection you're subjected to a P.C. ""the cartoons you are about to see..."" warning, then there's ANOTHER warning at the beginning of the documentary, and Warners STILL manages to omit 2 cartoons!?! Even more strange, the featurette includes clips from these 2 omitted cartoons and places them in historical perspective...And in case you're wondering why the Looney Tunes DVDs get treated better than the MGM cartoons (and why after three volumes of Tom and Jerry they still can't get it right), it's because different divisions inside Warner Bros Home Video handle them. Maybe they can get it together for Tom and Jerry on Blu-Ray...? In the meantime, way to go guys!"
1,WARNER BROTHERS has more problems than the cartoons they are omitting!,"In my own personal dealings with WARNER BROTHERS HOME VIDEO I have found them to have more problems than the subject matter they decide people should not see. They have no idea what they own, how it should be handled and don't even involve the people that originally created these classics. They don't even want to give copies to the people that helped with the DVD sets. The fans here are right, we need to omit WARNER BROTHERS and buying these DVDs until they can get their act together."
3,Semi good,Well the dvds were kinda what i expected.The only problem is i found smudges of finger prints on the back of the discs so my xbox had a little trouble reading it.
1,Disgusted & Insulted,I bought the first spotlight collection around 4 years ago when it first came out. I returned it the very next day for a refund after finding out that the cartoons were CENSORED. I have not bought any spotlight collections since and will continue not to buy them until they release an uncut set.Warner Bros should be ashamed and embarrassed for treating Tom & Jerry this way.
5,GREAT,My niece loves Tom and Jerry and loved getting this for Christmas!! Thanks for a great product and great prices!
1,Warner's Statement,"Here is the statement from Warner Bros as to why the two shorts are not being included on this release:Two shorts, ""Mouse Cleaning"" and ""Casanova Cat,"" will not be included in the third and final ""Tom and Jerry Spotlight Collection"" of theatrical animated shorts from the Hanna-Barbera era at MGM. Although this collection is intended for mature audiences and collectors (not for children), Warner Home Video made the decision to omit these two shorts because, regardless of their historical context and artistic value, the offensiveness of certain scenes containing inappropriate racial stereotypes would diminish the enjoyment of the Collection's 35 other classic cartoons for a large segment of the audience.How's that for corporate PC jibberish."
1,WB WTF happened this time?,"Warner Brothers you do such a great job on the The Looney Tunes Collections (well save for Whoopi Goldberg) and you did a great job on Droopy;why do you continue to screw up the Tom & Jerry discs? The only thing that offends me about these cartoons is your continuous censorship.I want to see the original uncut,unrevoiced cartoons.I realize we live in different times than we did sixty years ago,but they're just cartoons.If certain PC activists,ethnic groups or hell..anybody is offended by these cartoons then they shouldn't buy or watch them.It's funny how we,grown people cannot purchase sixty year old cartoons yet my 15 year old daughter and her friends can go to a theater and see any kind of violence they like with a PG13 rating.Go figure...."
1,"Do not buy, set is heavily censored.","I had every intention of buying this set, but when I read of the 2 cartoons being left off for Political Correctness reasons, I decided then and there that enough is enough. I bought the first 2 sets and got the disk replacements, but won't even consider buying the 3rd until I know that I am getting a complete and uncensored set. I am 45 years old and I will decide for myself what I watch or don't watch. I don't need a nanny at Warner Home Video deciding for me. So, let us put some pressue on WHV and see if we can't keep the sales figures down for this item."
3,What A Joke!,"I am so bloody sick of political correctness. How ironic that this Tom & Jerry set would have a featurette called ""60 Years of Cat and Mouse: The Tale of Tom and Jerry - The History of One of Animation's Greatest Teams, Hanna-Barbera - from Early Days to Censorship Controversies to Award-Winning Glory"" and then omit ""Mouse Cleaning"" and ""Casanova Cat"". If you find something offensive-don't watch it-but quit depriving others who want to see it. They can air an animated show like ""the Boondocks"" or ""Robot Chicken"" and yet still censor Classic Warner brothers & Tom & Jerry cartoons. This world has become a really sad place."
2,Release it all,"Although it would make perfect sense only to write a review of what is released on the disc and what it is not, I would only say that most of these historical DVD packages have taken a lot of care to give fans their due. By not releasing two cartoons, I have avoided buying as I am not a huge fan of the series, and feel like I wasted my money on marginal cartoons (WB cherry picked Vol#1&2 in which I have) that does not complete the series.Please notice the popularity of the Popeye and Disney Treasures on how it should be released."
5,can't get enough,"September, 1988, my boyfriend picked up this CD at a supermarket and played it for me during a long drive through central Nevada. After hearing it twice through, I was hoping he would play it a few times more (but I was a little embarrassed that I couldn't get enough of it). Since then, I've discovered the Kinks' Village Green Preservation Society and a few other albums. Years later, I still feel compelled to reach for this album (I have the record version too) and simply bask in the wonderfulness of it."
5,One of the best from the best!,"When I had the opportunity to meet with Ray Davies a decade ago after the Kinks played the ""House of Blues"" in LA, it was the ""Arthur"" album I chose to bring to have Ray sign. A masterpiece from beginning to end."
4,Kinks Concept Album,"If you are a Kinks completist, then this is a must purchase. Not their best LP but still an important piece to their catalog."
1,...,"... I guess I must be a strange Kinks fan, because I found this CD to be very disappointing. I don't believe there was a single track that I found interesting/entertaining.They've done SO much better..."
5,Incredible Album!,"This album has got at all!Great songs. Great playing. Great lyrics. Interesting story. Good production. Plenty of bonus-tracks.Of course ""Shangrila"" is the oustanding track.But there are no weak songs here.""Some Mother`s Son"" is very moving - could be an anti-war anthem!""Young and Innocent Days"" - beautiful sentimental Davies ballad.Energy in the rockers ""Brainwashed"", ""Victoria"" and ""Nothing to Say""Lots of humour and satire throughout the album.Among the bonus tracks you`ll find some af Dave Davies` best songs from this period, ""This Man He Weeps Tonight"" and ""Mindless Child of Motherhood"" as well as the previously unreleased ""Mr Shoemaker`s Daughter"" from Dave`s aborted 1969 album!This album deserves to be in any record collection."
5,get it now,"without a doubt one of the most underrated albums of all time. i'm positive that Ray Davies wore himself out with this album. these songs are pure brilliance. you'll hear 3 or 4 melodic ideas in almost every song and each one of them are golden sweet.you can hear that they're streching themselves a bit in terms of the instrumentals, but that doesn't detract from the music at all. this is w/o a doubt the height of the Kinks powers."
4,"4-1/2 Stars, But A Question...","Won't go into a long review as the previous four reviewers do a great job in that regard. Most happy with this package, but in comparing this with my previous Castle release, can anyone tell why ""King Kong"" wasn't included here? In checking session dates, it was recorded at the same time as the majority of this album. Looking forward to more Kinks Deluxe packages!"
4,A great read,"This book is such a great read, if your looking for a book to defend your view point against JW this is not that book. How ever this book does convey a wealth of information about the JW or the Watch Tower society system of believe. I know this was written by a former JW the language and the catch phrases. If you are curious about the JW pick this book up it true light. Lol"
3,Not What I Was Looking For,"My mother-in-law is a Jehovah's Witness and I was hoping to find out more about her faith and why it causes disagreements between us. I personally found this book a bit over the top with spiritual debates which, unfortunately, made the reading very tedious. The personal story was excellent and heart-wrenching but it wasn't enough to save the overall book. I tolerated it and skipped over the religious arguments, but unless you're really interested in that, I can't recommend this book to you."
1,Disappointed!!!!,"This DVD only has the first part of the story, with no explanation as to how to get the 2nd part. Extreme disappointment!"
4,"Good, but very sad movie.","I always believed the Ramseys killed their daughter so I wanted to watch the movie to see how it was portrayed. The movie convinced me even more. It was very good, but there is one part that really bothered me....where they brought the little girl out of the basement after she had been murdered and she was stiff as a board. I know that is how it was in real life, but that scene bothered me for days. My daughter was about her age when I watched the movie so I know that is why it tore me up so bad. The actors in the movie did very well and the movie was well written."
3,Great Service. Average,"Hi There,I have received this item in a timely fashion. I can't fault the service at all.The only thing I was concerned about was the quality of the disc. It was very badly scratched.I am afraid to watch this disc in case it causes damage to my DVD player.Overall, always a fantastic service, but the quality of the disc is concerning.Thank you."
2,"Perfect murder, perfect town","I expected a paperback, not a DVD. Was it my mistake? After the dramaticbeginning, most of the rest of the film could not hold my interest."
3,The End Of The Road.,"""Identity Crisis"" is an appropriate title for the last official release by The Sweet. Any subsequent efforts under this name are more or less solo projects that employ the name to keep food on the table. While the album bears all of the hallmarks of The Sweet's sound (metallic guitars, high-pitched backing vocals, tight drumming), lead vocalist Brian Connolly is missing, having left the band in 1979. Other than the title track, nothing on this LP stands out. However, if you love The Sweet, there is no reason you shouldn't add this to your collection."
2,THE WORST ALBUM BY THE SWEET,"For die-hard fans only ! This was their very last original album released only in Germany (not even in the UK !) Arguably their worst album ever recorded and this is not only my personal viewpoint. Banal hard-rock where NOTHING reminds you of what was the original glam-rock by The Sweet. A Repertiore Records (Germany) 1992 release, not digitally remastered, extended booklet, original artwork... This is a waste."
4,Looking forward to Volume 2,"I agree with all the other reviews, this is a really good book. Half way through the book, I found myself looking forward to getting some free time to read another chapter, and it was harder and harder to put down as you get towards the end. There are tons of characters, which I found a difficult time keeping track of, but I concentrated on the main ones, at least the ones I thought were important. Come the last chapter I discovered I was duped, and one that seemed unimportant ends up being a Benedict Arnold. I had to go back and see if I missed the signs (I'm not telling you who).I would adives picking this book up for a good story. I know as soon as volume 2 comes out, I'll be in line to buy it."
4,nearly the best book ive read,"I was reading and it took me forever to put it down. It has everything you can think of for all types of people. Mystery, combat, love, loyality, betrayal. I admit it doesnt get to exiting until the last ten chapters, but the rest of the book fills you in with everything youneed to know for the end. I would concider this book for everyone"
4,The fundamentals of Option Strategy,"Option Strategies is an excellent intermediate treatise on option trading. While it doesn't go deeply into option pricing and implied volatility, its focus on strategy and decision structure serves the reader well. Almost every major position type, from the basic buys and writes to the more complex, such as ratio spreads and butterflies are covered. Each position is dissected in detail, with emphasis on how to deal with adverse and positive price impacts.In the pantheon of trading tomes, Courtney Smith's work should appeal to those looking for a sound foundation in option strategy. It is one place where a trader can look at any idea and figure out which type of play offers the best risk/reward alternatives. A solid non-technical book."
2,"Technically appropriate, emotionally crippled.","My son was born at 28 wks-while this book gave me all the med info-tech support I could have asked for, ultimately it felt 'hands off'. I am a huge advocate of kangaroo care for preemies, if you have a preemie PLEASE find a compassionate medical provider that understands and supports this kind of mother/child care! If you wish to breastfeed DO NOT GIVE UP! PUMP! It's not fun, but it can work. -DON'T SLEEP WITH YOUR CHILD IN YOUR BED?! At 16 mnths my son is just leaving our bed-it's been sweet, it's been HEALTHY. PLEASE read the Sears' 'The Baby Book' for emotional and common sense back-up, not geared specificly towards preemies, this book espouses the kind of HANDS ON parenting our children really need-especially our preemies. My '28-wkr' is healthy, bright and sweet-I credit kangaroo care and 'The Baby Book' for alot of it! I wish you the best."
2,Half the picture,"The emotional realities of life in the NICU are as important as the medical realities. This book doesn't do a good job of recognizing the importance of emotional support, and has tone that is authoritative but not warm or encouraging on an emotional level."
1,Bad Fit,"It almost fit. It looked like it should fit, but it did not fit. I'll have to find a completely different work-around. Oh well, another ten bucks down the drain."
1,"Sadly, it fits but it doesn't work","It fits, but it doesn't work, don't buy this, buy a real HDMI to DVI-D cable if you want to play a video game console con your computor monitor"
5,I Laughed So Hard I Almost Peed My Pants,"Eddie Izard pokes fun at the entire history of Western Civilization in this seemingly stream-of-consciousness soliloquy. He is quite possibly the most hilarious person I have ever heard. If you are not up on history or take offense at people ridiculing religion; Beware - this is not the comedy for you.I have sat here pondering, but there seem to be no good words to describe Eddie Izard. He is a self-proclaimed ""executive transvestite"", which means he is not weird and is into girls. I hate to tell you Eddie, but even if you wore nothing but feed-store clothes, you would be classified as weird by most of my southern-fried relatives and neighbors."
5,"Get the Attends, you'll wet your pants laughing","Hands down, no competition, without a doubt the funniest comedy routine I have ever seen. And to find a man (an executive transvestite) with such great taste in clothes and make-up! It just doesn't get funnier than Eddie Izzard and Dressed to Kill."
5,Got to see him live!,"Eddie Izzard's comedy is refreshingly original, fast-paced, intelligent, thought provoking and hysterically funny. After taping ""Dress to Kill"" on HBO, we thought we were going to wear out the tape (we're waiting for the DVD). Frequently when we watch it, one of us will discover something we had missed - sometimes because we were laughing or simply didn't get it at the time. Once you get on his wavelength, watch out - you too will be impatiently watching for new releases. This past June, unknown to me, Eddie was in Seattle and my husband surprised me with tickets to see his new show, ""Circle"". We laughed ourselves sick during the entire two-hour show and left the theatre physically exhausted, unable to recall very few specifics of the performance because of the jam-packed fast-paced material that was delivered in his true Executive style. ""Circle"" was even funnier than DTK (if that's possible) and we are anxiously waiting it's release on DVD. Cake please."
5,Fantastic!,"I have been waiting YEARS for this to come out!This is the best stand-up routine by him thus far. Eddie's showcases his genius by pontificating and poking fun at everything from religion to history to pop culture.Hilights are:""Do You Have a Flag"" bit wherein he breaks down English colonialism for you sort of The British Empire for Dummies.""Europeans"" where he describes Italians, French, English and so on with such biting wit..it's uncanny.All of his religious bits are as usual, hilarious. When he does God in a James Mason voice, you had better have some oxygen handy.Eddie is seriously underrated, for now, but I am sure once this hits the DVD players of the States he will be very, very well known and not as just another pretty face, in heels, who's a guy."
1,Eddie is tired,If you think a guy dressed in drag pontificating about generic topics is hilarious and entertaining then by all means buy this DVD. I personally thought this was a tired performance that lacked originality or spark. I think Eddie is a strange person and does not compare to the wit or comic energy of Robin Williams.
3,Doesn't seem to be the HBO footage,"I had been looking forward to the release of this DVD. My first exposure to Eddie Izzard was via a low quality VHS recording of HBO's one hour showcase, so I was excited about getting a clean copy for my collection. This edition seems to be of another performance with a whole different technical video crew. The cuts and shots are really strange at times, zooming out all the way from the back of the hall at critical moments of expression. Plus the editing is a not as tight as I remember the special being. There is a lot of Eddie pausing and staring into space for a moment to regain his placement in his act, something I do not recall seeing in the HBO version. He also seemed to have a cold cause he would wipe his nose with his knuckle a lot. These things might sound petty, but the viewing just didn't seem right. I am glad to have a archieval grade copy of his performance but feel a bit slighted on the content."
3,Kinda disappointed,"I love Eddie Izzard, seriously I do. My girlfriend and I have watched his Glorious show to the point that my tape is now fuzzy. That said I was disappointed with this DVD. I saw Dress to Kill first on HBO and I loved it! Where my disappointment comes in is this DVD wasn't his HBO performance. In fact watching it this feels like the last leg of his tour and he was quite bored of it. Eddie is at his best when he's enjoying himself. Here is to hoping the HBO version gets released someday."
5,Eddie Izzard is hilarious,My husband and I are huge fans of his and this is by far our favorite DVD by him. Way to go!Cake or Death??!!
5,Eddie Izzard - Dress to Kill,"How do you describe this guy? Got in late from a business meeing, was flipping channels before I hit the sack and came across a 6 foot plus Brit in drag doing stand up on HBO.....two hours laying I'm still glued, with tears streaming down my cheeks! Unbelievably clever; started this particular bit with the old testament, and worked up to present day. I'm a terribly tough critic, and can honestly say there's not one comedian's routine that I've ever devoted two hours to, but Eddie Izzard is absolutely one of the funniest that I have come across. A must see."
5,You MUST buy this DVD!!!,"My 13 year old son and I watch this DVD every chance we get! It never gets old. Izzard's take on history is unlike any other...if I were a history teacher I'd find some way to get it into my curriculum. At least it would provoke discussion. While there is profanity, it's no worse than what most of us utter during rush hour. In a time of little intelligent humor, this is a jewel."
5,Cake or Death,"My daughter made me watch this recently, and since then I've shown this video to everyone... my friends... my parents (upper 60's), my childrens friends (VERY hip and judgemental), my brother (VERY VERY cynical and critical.) And to this day, I haven't come across anyone who doesn't love it. This is one of the funniest comedy specials I have ever seen.(THE funniest? Maybe so!)Anyway, I'm most definitely a fan.J"
5,The Funniest thing I have ever seen!!,"It was 1999...I, being and insomniac, was up late channel surfing when I came accross Dressed To Kill. I watched it and laughed so hard that I was afraid I was going to wake my sleeping parents.For years I told everyone I could about Eddie Izzard but wished I had a way for them to see it.When it came to DVD I bought it instantly and have since introduced many of my friends and family members to Eddie Izzards hilarious brand of comedy.I have probably seen it 100 times and I laugh almost as hard every time as I did the first time I saw it.Even if you have never seen this show or are not fimalar with Eddie, I would still reccomend buying this DVD!!It is, and will probably remain, the funniest thing I have ever seen!!""So..ummm..Yeah"""
5,"So, you Americans have discovered Eddie ???","Us Brits (even those of us now living in the US) have known about Mr. Izzard for quite some time now. I own most of his tapes, (Dress to Kill, Glorious, Definite Article etc), but the sad fact is that they're not all available in the US !!!I have struggled for years to try and describe him to people who've never seen him, and the closest I've got is by saying that he's like 'The Far Side' in person. Squirrels, pigs, moon monsters, evil ducks, giraffe's who own dogs, the grim reaper with his updated lawnmower, all come alive in his videos. Be prepared for comedy that doesn't run in straight lines, and keep your imagination handy at all times. If you've already lost it (your imagination that is), then don't bother buying, it will be wasted on you !"
5,cake or death?,".Dress to KillEddie Izzard at the top of his form. Friends either find him sensational or don't like his kind of humor. There seems to be no in-between. This DVD is preceded by a regrettable bit of nonsense re San Francisco that might discourage new viewers from getting on to his marvelous stage presentation. His NY presentation of this show, shown on HBO, was better, mostly since it didn't have the terrible introductory material in this DVD. Looking forward to a DVD of his current show, ""Stripped""."
5,I love Eddie,"Dress to KillI've been looking for this DVD forever. I saw this show when it was released on HBO. It won't disapoint! All I can really say is your going to need a flag, a little splashy, splashy. Highly recommend!"
5,"An Incredibly Funny, Clever Man","Thanks to a case of insomnia, I stumbled across Eddie and his ""Dress to Kill"" special on HBO. He is by far the funniest, most clever comedian I've ever seen! I have since bought ""Glorious"" (which I also recommend) as well as a 3 cassette set of his other concerts from amazon.uk. The man is amazing! And, if you're not careful, you just might learn something from his act...(but you'll need to bring your own mouse, table, cat, chair, and monkey!)"
2,Would have been great if I got what I ordered...,"I received a different DVD in the ""Dress to Kill"" case! I was so disappointed that I wasted my money!"
2,lizzard,"This was alittle off the wall, disappointed as I thought it would be fun to watch and have a few laughs.....not so.."
2,"disappointing, a flash in the pan","After ""Glorious"" and ""Unrepeatable"", this comes as a major disappointment. Izzard is capable of so much better than the materal presented here. I got the distinct impression that he was ""dumbing down"" his act for an American audience, i.e., much of this seems downright patronizing. For example, the Englebert Humperdink and Heimlich Manuever material is painfully unfunny right from the start, and it's inclusion seems to be soley for the reason that even Americans will have heard of them.The first 20 minutes has some decent laughs, but then Eddie loses the plot and bumbles along for the remainder of the show.To be fair, all of Eddie's shows tend to be hit-or-miss. On a good night, he's quite literally glorious, on a bad night he's merely diverting."
2,Did not make me laugh enough,"It wasn't what I was expecting. The comedian was wearing a lot of make up (which sort of threw me off) and was a bit hard to understand due to his strong British accent. Some bits provoked a chuckle, but I just had a hard time getting into it."
5,How's it going Dr. Heimlich?,We saw this on HBO when it came out 3-4 years ago now. We STILL go around the house quoting phrases from it. Hilariousness abounds!
5,Simply the best!,"Fast, wildly funny and atonishingly clever -- it doesn't get any better than Eddie Izzard.If one wants to absolutely HOWL in laughter -- buy ""Dressed to Kill"" right this very minute ... click that I-Click thing right now, immediately."
5,"Perfect, fast & quality","I ordered 2 separate movies for Eddy Izzard. I have never used online services to ever purchase anything. I was a bit weary of doing so but was pleasantlt surprised on the efficiency of this seller. He was quick, charged exactly what I agreed, & made my wife's Christmas. We were not able to find these items for the last 4 years in stores,. I did however finf thre ""Glorious"" DVD for double the price. Thank you so much!!!"
5,Eddie Izzard,Eddie Izzard is one of the funniest comedians around today. His humor examines our history and how we are different and yet the same. His is multilingual and incorporates this into his show.
5,Funniest Stand Up I've Ever Seen,It took me 3 days to be able to function. My stomach muscle hurt for days. I literally fell off my couch 3 times the first time I saw this. DO NOT MISS THIS ONE. So funny you'll fall apart.
5,Amazing preformer - great show,I am showing this this all my friends and we all love it. This is a great show. You must see it !
5,EDDIE IS AWESOME!!!,"Robin Williams says he's the funniest man on the planet -- I'm forced to agree!!!!D2K is classic Eddie and nothing is sacred -- including the Bible, chocolate at Easter (it's the color of the Cross???), James Mason, jam, Sean Connery and covered in BEES!!!!!Get past the 'omigod he's dressed like a GIRL' and pay attention to what the man has to say. You'll laugh, you'llthink - you may learn something...All I need now is Definite Article and my collection will be complete!!!! Love him!"
5,I nearly peed myself I laughed so hard,The first time I saw Dress 2 Kill was at my nephew's and as soon as I got home I immediately logged onto Amazon.com and ordered it. Eddie Izzard is one of the funniest people on the planet and this DVD showcases him perfectly. I recommend this DVD to everyone I meet and show it to anyone I can get to hold still long enough to watch it! Fantabulous!!!
4,Like Robin Williams? You'll love this too!,Eddie Izzard displays the same stream of consciousness comedy where jokes come fast and furious and often refer to a bit 10 minutes before.
5,Funny,"This is very funny. The guy has his own perspective and ultimately draws you in until you are laughing so much that you start to believe. Well, NOT, but after 400 hours you might."
5,Did I leave the gas on?,"I've seen all the reviews for this with 5 stars, and I'd just like to add to them. Funniest thing you'll ever see. I guarantee it."
5,LOTS of LAUGHS,"My husband, my in-laws, and I laughed until we couldn't breath!! He is so funny to watch over and over."
5,"Humor, History, and Humanity","Possibly one of the best stand-up routines that I've ever seen. I've been waiting for this HBO special to come out on DVD for a while. This is an amazing show and definately worth the watch. Jon Clese called Eddie Izzard the funniest man in Britain, an endorsement that carries a lot of weight."
3,Off the wall Izzard,"Izzard's brand of humor is not for everyone. His skit on Engelbert Humperdinck is absolutely hilarious. Get past the heels and nails, and see one of England's best."
5,It is my... FAVORITE!!!,I love Eddie Izzard and have gotten all of my friends to love him too. Dress to Kill is hilarious and smart. I have watched this over 10 times and it's still funny.
3,Izzard is Awesome!!,One of my all-time favorite comedy videos. We laugh until our sides hurt. You will love Eddie Izzard's Dress to Kill!!
5,One of the Funniest Acts I've Ever Seen!!,Eddie Izzard has the gift of comedy. His style in this video is very playful. He gets the audience involved in his act and makes their response part of the joke. He has a lot of energy and there's a sort of mischeif in his facial expressions that keeps you watching to see what he'll do next. Eddie Izzard is one of my favorite comedians after viewing this performance.
3,"Very entertaining speaker, but not very funny","I know I am pretty late to the party, so to speak, but oh well. I am a huge fan of stand-up and had seen bits and pieces of Eddie Izzard, but never a full special until this one. I would have to compare him to George Carlin -- watching both comics, you are somewhat amazed and entertained by their speaking ability, but you don't laugh all that often. That said, Carlin of course had (and has) tons of fans, and Izzard does as well. To each his own, and I was indeed somewhat entertained, but as a -comedy- special, I would not rank this very highly."
1,It Works If Your Not Moving,"I tried this product. Now I know why the MSRP is $300 and the selling price is $100. It worked great on the tailgate of my pick-up using my battery charger for a power source. But when I installed it in my truck, one problem occurred. I could not tell the difference between a lawn chair and a work boot. Just a lttile out of focus. Completely useless, I sent it back. It does look cool as an ornament."
1,Ripped OFF,"Bought this 3 months ago, Paid 75.00 to have it installed. Sunlight keeps you from seeing anything and three months later is stops working at all.Now I am out 150.00."
2,Only under certain conditions will this work,"After 2 unanswered emails and over an hour on perma-hold (they never did answer), I am returning this system.Pros: The video image on the display is excellent when it's not too bright.Cons: There is a total lack of support from Pyle* as others have said, the instructions are worthless.* the supplied video cable would only work for a small car, way too short* the clamps that secure this mirror/display over top of the existing mirror don't always hold* any amount of sunlight washes out the display and it all looks like a mirror* the ""mirror"" is so dark, it is not safe to use as a mirror, rear visibility is poor at best* I tried mounting it to the sun visor thinking the sunlight should not be a problem. I was wrong.* there are buttons on the display that do something, but I never figured out what they doUnless someone comes out with a better way to integrate the display into a ""real"" mirror, I will stay away from this type of unit."
1,"pyle 7"" rear vision monitor and camera",I have bought hundreds of things from Amazon and have been very satisfied. This item is the exception. It simply does not work well inbright daylight or at night. The lights never lit for night. It is my 2011 worse buy.
3,Don't Follow the Directions / Poor Video,Connecting the power as shown in the directions lead to a dead battery after being out of town on travel for nine days. I would suggest that the power be applied to a switched connection. If I had it to do over I would NOT get a reflective mirror/screen. In the day time it is hard to see the video due to the glare on the glass.
4,Good product Bad plan,"I gave the box of the product to the technicien and he worked like creasy to make it work in following the plan in the box. Finally, he realised that the plan was bad. Guess who had to pay for the bad plan? The product is perfect."
3,Nice but poor material quality,"on my country the weather is hot, when my car was on the parking lot, the glass detachment"
4,The right price,"The price of this back-up camera sold me on it. I looked at more expensive cameras, but for an 1988 RV no need to go over the top. The camera works just fine, and with the money I saved I had a friend install it so I had no issues with any directions. Not a bad way to go if you want a good quality back-up camera for under 100 bucks!"
2,FUNCTIONAL BUT!,"Functional but not very good in day,reflections from rear window is a problem. I may trya glare reduction screen on the rear glass. Object are closer than they appear, (needobject sensors). Night vision -- My lens has a smear on the inside that distorts asmall portion of my FOV (field of view). Just remember its an aid not an answer."
3,back up view,"I bought the camera and had it installed by the car dealer. When the back up camera is ""turned on"", it shows ""No Signal"" when the car is in drive. The mirror itself while in drive always gives the view of night vision. At night the back up camera is useless. If I have installed it incorrectly I would like to hear from someone. The way it is I can't recommend it at all."
4,PYLE PLCM7200,"The directions are no help. Some people say that the leds on the camera dont workhowever they do, night vision, they dont put off any visable light, but at nightthey work well. Install is straight foward, once you find the back-up light wire.The remote is great, once you leave it in reverse long enough, then put it in driveyou can use the remote to turn the camera back on, even when you are in park or any other gear. One falt, it is hard to see out the back when just using it as a rearview mirror. For the money it works well on my Toyota FJ. (o T0Y0TA O)"
2,just ok but the price is good,The instructions are useless the camera isnt water proof it doesnt have bluetooth as the manual states bluetooth function it doest retain the settings when you turn the power off in order to get the picture on the correct side the writting is backwards other than that i guess it's ok
1,"Works,but have realy bad definition,low picture resolution,don't work at night.","Works,but have realy bad definition,low picture resolution,don't work at night, you can't see nothing,bad product.PYLE PLCM7200 7-Inch TFT Mirror Monitor/Back-Up Night Vision Camera Kit"
2,Pyle PLCM7200 TFT,"You get what you pay for, in daylight you can't see if the sun is bright or at night if it's very dark. Don't buy this product for any price. The company doesn't provide you with any instructions on how to operate the system, it's all by trial and error."
3,Marginal Performance but the price was right,"Am using it on a 29' motorhome, cable is probably a little long and loses definition but it is OK in the daytime, nothing but a blur at night. Comes a long way from acting as a normal mirror when power is off."
4,Awesome mirror,It's looking good more than my expectation. Easy to assembly and pretty cheap. I love this product.
1,no instructions,"The product came with no instructions on how to use it. The website says ""manual coming soon"". Why would you sell something without a manual available? An email to the company was unanswered. I will never buy from that brand again. Amazon handled the return without any problems,thank goodness."
3,It's okay,I had to spend several hundred dollars to have it installed. Sun glare makes it hard to use in daytime
2,Lasted about two months,"Got the camera for a chevy express van. Worked fine for about a two months, then it went dead. No image on the monitor, touchscreen and remote unresponsive.. thought it might be an issue with the power supply, but looks like the monitor just crapped out. The camera itself still works, so I'll probably try to salvage that and use it with another system.Also, it may be worth noting that the monitor is somewhat heavy and it clips to the vehicle's existing rear view mirror. On older vehicles, this can cause the adhesive on the mirror mount to loosen and fall off."
4,rating,looks like all that we wanted just haven't gotten to install it yet. Wish it was wirerless. Looks like a great unit from the instructions and lots of optins.
3,too much reflection in the sunlight,"The product is overall ok, but there is too much reflection in the sunlight, I can't see the camera image - instead i am seeing the interior of my car."
1,poor unit in all aspects..,"Absolutely the worst installation instructions i have ever encountered...and NO operating instructions....after 30 minutes of fumbling around, i finally got a video display....but it was a ""mirror image""...figured out if i turned the unit on/off many many times, a normal display showed...and then would just randomly revert back to a mirror image...wow...the clarity of the display would also fade in and out from a reasonable pic to a very grainy/blurry display....all in all a complete disappointment...am returning it and will look for a different brand.."
3,Works fine but...,The rearview mirror (with the camera off) is not very good during daytime driving and borders on worthless at night... It doesn't seem bright enough?
3,Pyle PLCM 7200 7 inch TFT rear view with night vision,"It does as advertised, wiring instructions a little vague, it has a night light for back up which I don't think is needed on my car.there is a bright glare spot at night which set up and adjustments won't cure. works well with the brake lights on.it's livable, it works, and for the price it's worth the money"
3,Don't buy it unless you know how to wire it.,"First, throw away the 4 page manual. It doesn't tell you anything about what to wire it to. Yes, there are leads for hot, ground, reverse, and camera, and they are marked. Each vehicle is different so you have to know or figure out which wires to splice in to. The LED's don't light up. Camera works fine. An email to Pyle audio yielded no response. Mirror unit has 2 video inputs. I used a Y adapter to feed the camera to both inputs because I got tired of switching inputs to see the camera. Once in a while, the unit does not turn off when shifting out of reverse. For the money, it is okay. It was a lightning deal. Had I paid full price, no way would I have bought it."
1,"Recieved a broken product, no help from Pyle","I recieved this one day after ordering it (Thanks Amazon) I installed it, then go to test it out and the screen doesnt work. I then tested it with a buddies exact setup and found that the screen was junk, I contact Pyle to get a replacement and they want me to send them the product and money to have them ship it back to me. Not to mention it took them 4 days to get back to me....I wll never purchase another Pyle product"
4,nice product,Its ok for the price still a good mirror monitor. the night vision was not as i expected but then again to few things to tell about it. I recommend it as far as I have it
5,rear mirror camera,works as advertised...even comes with extras. you can even send your dvd signal to the mirror. picture is clean and HD quality of all behind you. this will save lives and horrible injuries i am sure. every car should have this for less than $85/kenny
2,Bad customer service from Pyle,PYLE PLCM7200 7-Inch TFT Mirror Monitor with Rear-View Night Vision CameraThe customer service from Pyle is ZERO..The camera that came with the system is faulty..I contacted Pyle via E-mail with no reply..I then contacted Pyle via phone and they told me to send back the camera with me paying shipping both ways..That's nearly $20 in shipping for a camera that cost them $10..I will not be buying from Pyle again..
3,Funny for two days,"It's been funny to watch my two cats learning how to use this thing for two days. Then I didn't use it anymore. Why? For these three reasons:1) Once the cats have learned how to get food out of it, it is super repetitive, the same action over and over again, no surprises, no fun.2) The dry food is not so dry, it is always a bit oily. That food will get in contact with your floor, everywhere.3) It is noisy: being made of hard plastics, it makes a lot of noise on my cement floor.I think I will use it again only when leaving my cats alone for 24 hours, so that they can avoid eating all the stuff I leave them at once."
2,Thin plastic,"I was a bit disappointed in this item. It's thin plastic and although I changed the size of the holes, just doesn't seem to make the cats work for their treats. Maybe a couple less holes would help."
4,One of the Best Cat-Toys EVERY (but atrotiously cheap design),"Challenging review because this is by far (compared to toy mice, roller track ball, things on strings, and other toys) the best, most used, most liked, cat toy (simply because it combines food with toy very ingeniously and effectively) ever. My two polydactyl cats love this thing and freak out when I fill it with a smidgen of food. That makes it 5-stars.But bloody hell, could they have made it any more cheaply and flimsily? When I first got it and opened (separated the two halves) and combined them, I thought a plastic binding clip snapped off (it fortunately had not, however). It probably cost about 0.20 to 0.30 sense to make, no joke). It's flimsy design makes me want to give it 1 to 2 stars. However it has held up, has not broken, still distributes food, and is still the most appealing cat toy out of all other cat toys combined, so 4 stars it is."
1,My cat couldn't figure out how to get food out.,"My poor cat wasn't able to figure out how to get food out of the ball. She would lick at the holes, but she never figured out that she could push the ball and food would come out."
1,Not interested,"My cats were never interested in this ball. I tried a few different treats and it made no difference. Also, the treats did not come out as easily as I assumed."
4,The Cat Loves It,That is the best review I can write. He likes the noise of the treats insidewhen he pushes as it rolls across the floor.
3,Worked ok for a few days,I thought this might make my fat cat get up and move around a bit. She beat the daylights out of this for two days trying to get the treats out. Unfortunately it fell apart about 3 days in. She's a pretty aggressive cat so it might work good for a gentler soul
1,My cats would not play with this,I have older cats so maybe you need to introduce something like this when your cats are young. My cats are 4 and neither really pushed this about or was that interested in trying to get food out of it and believe me my cats are treat oriented. However the holes in this thing are too big or my treats are too small cause even in the smallest hole setting treats were falling out to easily which is maybe why my cats got bored with this thing?
2,It leaves kibble all over the floor.,Its really a mess...maybe for fat cats who would eat every piece but I was just looking to exercise my cat.
3,My cat just stares at it,"Once in awhile she plays with it, but not much interaction. I guess it is just not her thing. I think I was looking for an easy way out of getting my lazy kitty to start moving."
3,Old cat isn't going to deal with this,My cat is too old and finicky to think that any part of this was fun. So for young cats it might be great. I don't know.
1,No interest.,My 2 cats really didn't even want to try this. Only one of 'em even bothered to poke at it.My Mom's cat didn't give it much thought either. So we gave it to her neighbor and her cat didn't like it either. So 4 cats in 3 households give this a paws-down. We've got one more neighbor to try; just hope that their 2 cats might be interested!
3,Puzzle feeder for cats,"I purchased this puzzle feeder ball for my cat and he loves it. I don't have to worry about him being bored at home. He doesn't have to beg for treats, he moves the ball around and voila! Treats appear."
5,Good buy for chubby kitties,My overweight cats have had fun playing with the feeder and I feel better giving them snacks in it because they have to work for the kibble. Good product!
2,my cat never learned how to use this,"if i take away her food and leave her with this ball, she starves. it's been a couple weeks and she still doesn't get it. i have demonstrated how to use this a million times."
4,Nice option for feeding cats,"Nice, simple feeding toy for cats. Easy to use and clean, easy to adjust the difficulty. My cats don't love it - but I just introduced it at the ages of 9 & 7 and I think they just prefer the easy way to eat. It is good activity for them and they can use it without difficulty."
2,Dissapointed,"I purchased this ball based on reviews that said it was great for overweight kitties - basically making them work for their meal. Maybe my cat is different than most but all she did was push it slowly along the floor with her nose to get the food that fell out of the hole. This was definitely not exercise driven. Maybe a kitten would be more apt to play with it to get the food, but my cat is 4 years old."
5,Great for multiple cat households,"In our house we have two male cats, that were fed twice a day. They used to engulf there food without seeming to take a breath. We decided to look into ways of encouraging them to slow down. The first thing we tried was separating them into different rooms. This worked but they still ate quickly. Wishing our cats got more exercise in the winter we decided to give this product a try. It took a few times for the cats to get used to the concept of having to work for their food but we have been able to progressively choose smaller wholes. Instead of taking them 2min to eat their entire meal it has now slowed them down and they actually leave food behind for later. This product has worked great. Having an adjustable piece to change the size of the wholes from SUPER easy to fairly challenging allows the cats plenty of ease in learning how to use it.I would recommenced this for anyone who's cats compete for food or eat to fast. Also for overweight cats ""as ours are""."
5,Slim Cat,I am very happy. The cat is using it! He does not fuss all the time for food and seems more content.
5,Love the SlimCat Ball,"This is a great way to keep a ""busy"" small dog occupied on your way out the door. My shih tzu loves this product--she is a very resourceful and busy, little girl and enjoys working with this ball very much. I would highly recommend to anyone with a small dog that gets bored easily and needs mental stimulation."
5,Yay!,"After reading the reviews, we were hopeful but unsure about the food ball. We have two cats, one of which begged for food all day long. She was also getting chubby. We purchased two food balls (one for each cat) and started using them the day they arrived in the mail. It did take some adjusting for the cats, but we refused to feed them another way and they soon gave in and adjusted to the new routine. It has been five days. The begging is almost nonexistent, and we have noticed that they are eating less. We are thoroughly pleased and would highly recommend this item for begging and chubby cats."
2,Don't buy for older cats.,"This ball doesn't work for my cat in the least bit what so ever. Chanel thinks she's a princess and wouldn't eat out of the ball with her life depended on it. In fact the ball was such a failure, she was eating food off the floor where her food bowl used to be. When she saw that I was taking her food bowl down she went crazy.So for my cat this ball was a total failure. I would also suggest reading the instructions first, because once you break it in half it's almost impossible to put it back together. Always go for unscrewing the lid at the top.All in all, not recomended for old cats. Escpecially spoiled ones."
3,"Product seems good, but Cats didnt take",The product is simple to fill and setup. My cats just didn't seem to take to them. Overall was easy to figure out just have to hope that your pet will want to bat it around.
5,Great distraction,"We have 2 dogs, and feeding time was a problem to keep the kitten from trying to eat the dog's food. Now I give her the ball and this keeps her occupied.I like the ability to adjust the size of the holes. Now all I have to do is keep the dogs away from the kitten's ball!"
1,Awful,"made an utter mess everywhere. and the ex-rommate's cat figured out how to roll it between his paws to get the food out. so getting exercise did not happen, which is what we were going for."
