4,Dia Comp Hoods,"These are the Non Aero type, they are well made and hold up to stretching over the bars and levers."
4,A-OK,"This is the Cane Creek replacement for old Dia-Compe non-aero brake hood covers. The cover looks and fits fine, but the hand rest area is not nearly as soft/thick/cushy as the original product. When I ordered the product, the picture had the Dia-Compe logo/name on the item and I was a bit disappointed the item I received was labelled Cane Creek. The correct picture has since been put in the ad (at least on Niagara's site)."
1,"""Dia-Compe"" that's not.","I was very disappointed to find upon receiving my shipment that the Dia-Compe hoods shown in the title of the item listing, the product photo, and description are in fact ""Cane Creek"" hoods. Nobody wants anything branded ""Cane Creek"" on their classic bike, and it appears the seller knows this so deceivingly misrepresents their hoods.One occasionally expects this sort of dodgy listing behavior on eBay but NOT on Amazon.com.In addition, the hoods are very thin and flimsy and I consider them an inferior product.This is my first poor experience with a vendor sanctioned by Amazon.com, and it's a shame."
2,paul,Deceptive way of selling inferior brake hoods. Cane Creek is NO Dia Compe. Cane Creek USA used to have high quality products. Does Cane Creek even make brake components? Why show a Cane Creek hood and advertise it as Dia Compe. I'd rather have non branded hood than a cane creek branded one
4,Great replacement!,"Fits great on old Weinmann levers. Tight but goes on without too much trouble. Does get slightly in the way of the level, but no big deal."
5,Good stuff,The package was sent quickly and the product was exactly as it was described and it was very decently priced
2,hood,did not fit my shimano 600 brake levers. i had to cut them and then they still didnt come all the way to the handle bar. made for a different brake.
3,Nice Product,"Nice product, but required modifications to fit the Dia Compe brakes on my 70's era Raleigh Grand Prix road bike. I wish they didn't say Cane Creek but I can't complain about the qualtity of the material. In the end, I'll recommend this product to others."
3,Good But Small,"Before ordering this book, notice the listed dimensions. This book is small. Apparently, that is what the series title ""Vignettes"" is supposed to communicate. I didn't put that together until I received this book in the mail. It was quite a surprise.Still, this is a good book, and there aren't many books about Flagg and his artwork out there. The illustrations would have benefitted from being bigger, but they do work. I recommend this book--just be aware that it'll be one of the smallest art books in your collection."
1,not good,I used this product it is not good and not as thy say it is not helps prolong sexual not good
1,absolutely terrible,"complete fail. works for maybe 30 seconds, then wears off. absolutely would not recommend it. Not to mention, it numbs her body parts too."
4,Great music,"My only complaint is that the melody is often imposed on the piano part. Sondheim's music for this play is beautiful and driven by his chords. To make it playable with the melody, they had to remove some of the notes. My suggestion: buy it and let the singer sing the melody."
5,"This is all we have, folks. Enjoy it.","The vocal selections of any Sondheim show tend to be a tease until the full vocal score is published. Sadly, the full score for ""Merrily We Roll Along"" is no longer in print, (and how I wish I could remember to whom I lent my copy as I would get it back,) but we have to settle for the music that is here and let ""Bobby and Jackie and Jack"" and ""Franklin Shephard Inc"" come out of our hands by memory. ""Not a Day Goes By"" is one of the most brilliant pieces of irony ever written and this book gives you both versions. The finale: ""Our Time"" which is a remarkable tribute soing and wonderful for any graduation or special occasion, exists on page in this book without giving away it's secret. Nor will I. Ignorance is bliss. Buy the book. Use it as you will and enjoy it."
3,"Husqvarna 42"" Lawn Mower Mulching Kit",The first think I noticed was these items fit a Husqvarna lawn tractor but are not Husqvarna brand which is what I thought I was buying. The plug that blocks the side discharge fits adequately but needs a bit of pushing and pulling to make it fit tight. Don't know if the brand name would do the same or not since I don't have one. I actually haven't used the blades yet due to my mower being brand new and seem to work fine. These blades look like there is more surface area to cut the grass blades so should work as well or better.
3,"Are the blades ""refurbished""?","Got this product for my Craftsman LT1000 lawn tractor. Both the blades and the mulch plug fit well, but the blades looked ""refurbished"". The blades were chipped, with imperfections, poorly painted with areas that seemed like the paint was used to cover up rust. The blades were not even sharpened so I had to do that myself. They were packaged in the original sealed box, so they must have come in such conditions from the manufacturer. Not a good showing for the manufacturer."
5,Another great Jaguar book by Nigel Thorley!,"This book is superb! Beautiful photographs of many E-Types and in the writing style that author Nigel Thorley is known for make this one of the best,affordable books on the E-Type.If you are an enthusiast,owner,restorer or just a collector of automotive books then you should add this book to your collection.A great quality book and good value.A collectible book not a coffee table book."
4,Fuse Holder,Heavy duty fuse holder but mine did not come with the fuse. Shipping was more then the item so bulk buy would be a good idea to have spears incase you ever need another.
3,recommended component,"As with anything electrical with the potential to short-circuit and cause a fire or electrical problem that could result in a fire, this is a must have!"
3,Great product.,The product is great. It is made very well. Just remember that it does not come with a fuse. You have to supply your own fuse. The picture is misleading .
4,In-line Fuse Holder,"I haven't had occasion to use them all, but the 10 Gage wire was way over sized for the 30 amp fuse I put in it. The 10 gage wire is much larger than the picture leads you to believe. Makes it difficult to be flexable. But, I like the weather cap that covers the fuse."
4,If I was to NITPICK,"This product was as advertised, and of perfectly ACCEPTABLE quality. The only issue I was able to find to complain about was the bonding between the rubber fuse holder, and the rubber insulation on the wire itself was not fully vulcanized. That having been said, even in a salt-water marine application, I expect I will have to wait a very, very long time for this area to fail!"
2,Buy It Locally.,Rubber cap will not go Completely Down over fuse and the fuse is ALL the way down. So it is NOT water tight. I sealed it with RTV. Also cable is all one piece which is no big deal to cut. But picture shows it already cut with bare ends.Auto parts store carries them too.And prices are cheap.
4,Good Fuse Holder,"Fuse Holder arrived quickly and feels sturdy, holds my 15 amp fuses tightly. Cap snaps to the body nicely. Wire came as a single line attached on each side, simply cut the wire to the length you need for both ends."
5,It is what it is,"This is exactly what I was looking for; 10 gauge copper wire in a protected fuse holder. For those who may not be familiar with wire gauge, this is a 10, not 12 gauge wire. 10 gauge is heavier wire, capable of handling more amperage, not as flexible as 12 gauge, but appropriate for it's intended use."
3,In-Line ACT Fuse Holder,Fuse Holder did not come with a fuse. It does not come with an installed fuse. Those are easy to get at any hardward store.
4,Works fine,"No problems. Don't know . Don't know what to say besides that. Oh using crimp connectors worked fine, once I found I was supposed to crimp on each end, not in the middle."
4,Does what is needed,"This fuse holder comes with the wire uncut and looped in a circle. When cut, a smaller than advertised wire guage was revealed. Unless the wrong one was sent, it is actually 12 awg wire with extra thick insulation. It is however very fine strand copper which is good for current flow. Even though the guage is not accurate, it was not expensive and still does what I needed."
5,Great Product,Better than I expected. Quality fuseholder with 30A fuse at a great price even with shipping. Delivery was quick.
2,Cheap Junk,I ordered the same fuse holder back in April and received good quality products and the fuse holder even came with a 40 amp fuse. I reordered 2 more but his time the fuse holder is very poor quality and no fuses included. I can live without the fuses but the holder is junk. Not worth the bother to return.
2,Laurel & Hardy steal the show in this crazy hodgepodge,"M-G-M applied the all-star format of ""Grand Hotel"" to this jumbled musical-comedy feature, so we have vignettes with comedy stars instead of dramatic stars. The parts are definitely greater than the whole, with outstanding contributions by Laurel & Hardy (who don't show up until the last 20 minutes or so), Lupe Velez, Jimmy Durante (as a would-be movie Tarzan), Charles Butterworth (as a droll tycoon), and George Givot (as a dialect-challenged lover). Don't look for a plot, and you'll enjoy this crazy-quilt of a movie."
3,A hodgepodge as only MGM could do it!,"HOLLYWOOD PARTY is one of those films that started out as a really great idea: a musical starring all of MGM's comedy stars. The production was troubled almost from day one, so the end result is somewhat less than great. But it's still passable entertainment that's too short to become tedious. The Rodgers and Hart score is lively, but not very memorable. Incredibly, Rodgers and Hart submitted ""Blue Moon"" for use in HOLLYWOOD PARTY, and it was rejected! But there are some pearly moments: an animated sequence supplied by Walt Disney is one, a funny scene with Ted Healy and His Stooges, (you know them better as The Three Stooges) is another. Best of all, are two scenes featuring Laurel and Hardy. Despite the brevity of their appearance, Stan and Ollie get top billing in the credits. Not one of the film's numerous directors receives any credit!"
2,"A Dull ""Party"" With Few Highlights","Every MGM director worked on this ill-conceived musical-comedy hodgepodge, but no one wanted to take credit - or blame - for the final product. Therefore, it's not surprising that ""Hollywood Party"" (1934) emerges as a rather dull affair. Among the few highlights are Laurel and Hardy's classic egg-breaking routine with Lupe Velez, a guest appearance by Mickey Mouse, and Walt Disney's Technicolor cartoon ""The Hot Choc-late Soldiers."" The rest is VERY heavy going."
4,Love chocolate,I ordered the 5 lb hershey for my girlfriends birthday. Her jaw dropped when she saw it.It lasted almost a month even though she shared it with friends and co-workers.
4,"Massive Choc!!! RocksNjaX, FL","Bought this as a gift to my big family. They love it but I wish it has the label ""the world's largest chocolate"" but I guess this was the old version label that's why its kinda lesser cost. But its okay, the taste that matters. Good Buy!!! Thanks Amazon (as always)"
5,AWESOME!!,GREAT PRODUCT!!! CHRISTMAS PRESENT FOR MY DAUGHTER! SHE MENTIONED SHE WANTED A 'BIG' HERSHEY BAR!!! THIS IS THE BIGGEST!!! HIGHEST QUALITY BY HERSHEY!
4,5lbs of fun,My 83 year old chocoholic Father in law loves this. He could just about lift it up. Great birthday present.
5,An excellent analysis of international trade in textiles.,"This superbly written book is rich in theoretical as well as empirical models of quotas and licenses in international trade. It provides very useful and clear insights for policymakers in trade issues, and should be a MUST for international trade researchers in textiles and apparels. I highly recommend it!"
5,True to its name & Unforgettable,"This is 3 DVDs in one. The places it takes you, most likely you've already known. But what's unforgettable is that it unfolds the most amazing events about that place right in front of you - the things that made these places truely spetacular. It is about lives, cultures or the true forces and beauty of nature. Each splendidly displayed and then moved on to others. It makes you hungry for more."
2,Much better DVDs out there,It was dissappointing. There are much better DVDs out there. It just gives a taste of selected few places. A bit shallow.
4,It doesn't glow blue,It fits the iPod perfectly and it is easy to slip it on (but not so easy to take it off). The screen protect sticks onto the iPod so that it makes it does not slide around. The only thing that I am a bit disappointed about is that it does not glow blue like the picture. It is the usual green color that shows with anything that glows in the dark. I think it is a bit over priced but it is better than others that I have seen.
4,Ready for More!,"I turned my 16-year-old grandniece on to the Skolian world this summer...she loved it! As do I. However, I do wonder when Asaro's publisher is going to collect all those miscellaneous short stores in the series into one volume -- I'd like to read them to help complete the big story. In the meantime, I am awaiting the next novel in the series."
5,FANGtastic,"Love the B/W upgrade, with a colorized version. RAY HARRYHAUSEN COLLECTION, FROM AMAZON WITH A GREAT PRICE. My favorite has to be EARTH V.S. THE FLYING SAUCERS"
3,Over and Over,"No, by ""Over and Over"" I'm not referring to the redundant extras. I'm indicating my displeasure that this set contains a film that any Harryhausen fan already owns on BD, 20 Million Miles to Earth. This is a five star set, but I will not buy it. Hopefully the individual titles will be released at some point (soon I hope)!"
4,I'm hooked,These look great on my jeep and will be very useful out on the trails. The bolts could have been larger to provide a more secure mount but the ones provided should be sufficient.
4,good,"this set is pretty small and better for younger kids who have trouble building the bigger Lego sets. it took me about 5 minutes to complete the construction. it is pretty good but not all that interesting in my opinion. if you like the bigger more adventurous sets, go for Temple of Mount Everest, Scorpion Palace, or Elephant Caravan.this set comes with 1 Lego figure, a crocodile, and some weapons and other accessories, such as a boat, a skeletion head, a tribal hat, and jewels. this is a good starter set though. i recommend this set to ages 4 and up because some pieces could present as choking hazards."
5,Excellent Brendel/Mozart,"This Sonatas is superb played by Brendel and is so far on my list of ""best Mozart discs from 2001-2002"" :-) but this disc also give you lifelong enjoy and I hope your life be long so you can listen to this superb disc many times.Highly recommended."
2,"Might be useful for insomnia, but not much else","Why anyone would release this snoozer of a fight to home video is a mystery to me. Why anyone would buy it is an even bigger one. Camacho ran like a thief the entire fight, and Mancini was too slow to catch him. Dull, dull, dull."
4,The Undercard!,"The main event is a disappointment with it going just like you'd expect with Mancini trying to chase down Camacho and never quite catching him. However! On the undercard is one of the best fights you'll ever see. In a bout to decide who would go face Paez for the title, Jeff Franklin an Lupe ""Little Guns"" Guiterrez fought an incredible 12 round SD that should go in your top ten. They fought inside, outside, up and down for both fighters, neither ever giving up though it seemed at times both were done. It was so clean the referee was practically a spectator. Imagine fighters working at a high level on the inside without tying up and drawing in the referee every 20 seconds. If you can pick this up for cheap it's worth it just for this fight!"
5,Awesome completion to the trilogy,"This book is my favorite of the three featuring Nathan Blaylock, son of Wyatt Earp. This guy writes 'em like they used to. Better than L'Amour!"
1,BAD---BAD---BAD,"I may have read a worse book but I can't remember when. I really liked the first two books in this series. I think I gave one a five start rateingand the other a four. But, this one is so bad. Nathan Blaylock, Jim Riley and Doc Hennison are together again but the action is scarse. There is page after page of thought and talk. Memories of Wyatt's earlier days, all severalages of more thought. The last 12 pages of the book are good, the rest is a waste. I know Parry can do better than this as the first two were so good. No mas---no mas."
2,too depressing,"If you like folk music than this is for you. The songs are too depressing for me, and did nothing for my 2 year old or husband. The only exception is the banana boat song and the lion sleeps tonight, which I'm not sure why they included in this compilation since it breaks up the more mellow flow the other songs. This is not fit for a ""sunny picnic"" as suggested in the intro. However, the musicians and vocalists are outstanding, as well as the artwork on the cd. I recieved this as a gift and was disapointed that there were only a few songs that I really liked."
1,pseudo intellectual tour de force or someone on hashish,"When I started the book I thought it rather interesting and it reminded me of Naipaul's Mr.Biswis's House....but the story quickly became loose and unbelievable and then just plain crazy.I have half a notion that Narayan plucks words out of the air ""Chevrolet"" ""corn fields"" and puts them in places where they jolt and don't belong. Coffee is used constantly...The story takes a completely unbelievable and insane turn when the movie studio part of it starts.This guy is no Naipaul that is for sure, it is amazing he is popular. If I had not read he wrote the books in English I would have put off this bad writing and story to the translation.I cannot believe this author is famous. Maybe other works are better??"
4,Great selection,"Fire and Ice is very nicely executed by Sarah Chang, and it's great to hear some of the unusual pieces (Sarasate) alongside better known pieces like Meditation, etc. Overall more fire than ice, I think - and a second copy will provide a gift for a fussy lady who loves violin!"
5,Just Plain Awsome!,I recently saw a video of Sarah Chang playing Carmen when she was only 10 or so. She has continued to amaze me with her amazing talent and I was thrilled to listen to the selections on this cd. I definitely would recommend this cd to anyone who loves a variety of slow and just amazing selections of music.
3,watery scrub,"I was expecting something a bit grittier to exfoliate my face with, this was more watery than i expected, it does leave my face feeling clean though."
3,It's ok....,"I agree with the review about the 'watery' consistency (It's almost on the runny side). It's a bit strong on the 'tingly' feeling so wouldn't want to use it to take off eye makeup, but it does leave your face smooth and clean feeling. I too was looking for more of a scrub with this but I still like Noxzema products in general."
5,A great specialized book for the new Vampire,"This book is an ideal resource for storytellers and players looking to play a ""road game"" of Requiem. It's got a lot of detail on why specific covenants would send their members on the road, the roles that various clans play in road coteries, specifics on concerns that vampires would face on the road, devotions, Cruac rituals, Theban sorcery, a sample of road antagonists or allies (including the oft-mentioned Unholy!) and a sample setting, Route 666.All in all, a great book, though honestly a bit heavily priced for such a thin book."
2,Poor excuse for a book...,"This book reads more like a prototype to what White Wolf was aiming to do with Midnight Roads. And to be honest, if you want a book detailing taking your game on the road, get that one instead of Nomads.About the only draw is the new Powers and Devotions.Otherwise the rest of the book is a waste and a hardcover module SAS for the ST who saw that the Chicago setting book was coming and decided to move their game from New Orleans to there.For me, the only saving grace to this book is having bought it used. Otherwise I'd complain about it being over priced with so few pages."
5,Outstanding!!!,This is one of the best books I've ever read. Tom lays out the truth of God's Word so accurately and elementary. This book on the doctrines of grace (commonly called Calvinism) should be in the library of ever Bible believing Christian.
4,Easy-to-read,"This book is very beginnerish, but is good as a reference for the more experienced artist. It covers a little bit of everything for you and is inspiring. I am glad I own this book. In fact, the spine on it is almost worn out from using it so much."
5,Review of Collections,"Finally, someone who sees! Shirley Luthman has an extraordinary insight into the heart and soul of mankind. This book sheds light on the path each of us travels towards true self-discovery. We could not put it down and never will."
1,A terrible learning tool,"The adult singers on this CD are not native speakers of French, and have very heavy American accents. As noted in other reviews, the songs aren't translated literally - in the case of ""twinkle twinkle little star,"" the English translation bears very little resemblance to what the French says. The children singers are very difficult to hear; I think they're native speakers, but the non-native adults sing loudly over them so your child doesn't get any benefit from them.If you wan to learn bad French, this is the CD for you."
2,Not something I would buy,"We borrowed this CD from the library and it was just ok. The songs were familiar, but it moved so fast that my kids just made up french sounding words and didn't learn a thing. It would be great for kids who have learned some french already, but I wouldn't recomend it as a learning tool."
1,Unpleasant songs and accents,"The singers do not have native French accents and the songs are annoying. How does a round version of ""Row, Row, Row Your Boat"" in english teach anyone French?"
4,Not that bad,"This cd covers some of the basics like the alphabet, numbers to 10, days of the week and some basic phrases in addition to songs. It is useful as a learning tool, especially if you find it cheap. We use it in the car."
1,Bad accent and can't hear what they are singing,I bought the audio version without lyrics and that was the worst purchase I have in amazon audible. The Teach Me Spanish is good and misled me to buy the French one too.
2,Don't torture your ears!,"I checked this out from my local library, along with Teach Me French and Teach Me Even More French. I liked this one the best of the three, yet I feel it still only merits two stars. I thought the organizational layout of the booklet was good-- it was based on the calendar year and events typical of each month. However, the singing is horrendous! I cannot stand to listen to it, which effectively makes this CD worthless as a learning tool, for if I can't stand to listen to it, I don't expect my children to listen to it. The singer has such a high pitched, nails on the chalkboard voice that she reminds me of contestants on American Idol who only audition so that they can get on TV. There are MUCH better French music CDs available. If you still think you're interested in this one, I urge you to check it out from a library first to see if you really, really want to buy it."
5,One of the best Groups of the early 70s,"they were only together as a group for about 5 years, but they made some great music!!!!!"
4,Mediating Postion of Christian theology of religions,"Braaten answers Knitter's book ""No Other Name?"" by chaning the ""?"" to the ""!.""He contends here against the prevailing univeralism, pluralism, etc. that the Christrocentric trinitarian confession is correct and viable. In essence all religions may have ""god"" but not ""Christ."" We only can know the real God in the incarnational-sacramental event of Jesus the Christ.The other religions expose only the law to us. However, he leaves out discussion on some of the more troubling issues, e.g. why does God choose only to reveal Himself in Christ and His gospel?While I would take issue with much of Braaten's confession, this is well worth the time and effort and reading and comparing with Knitter's et al."
4,Good so far,"I purchased this as a replacement battery for my HP Pavillion DV6000 laptop; which is currently my backup laptop. So far I have not had any problems with it since installing it. As far as battery life, it seems to be about the same as the old one; despite being a 12 cell vs a 6 cell.The truth of the matter is that it works and I can use the Pavillion DV6000 as my travel laptop while leaving my new HP laptop at home. I will make an update if and when something was to develop.Update 9/5/11OK so far the battery seems to be working out pretty good. Granted it does not last as long as I would like but it has my laptop working and that is all that matters to me. The 12 cell causes the laptop to be raised in the back a bit and tilted slightly; which is fine with me since the slight elevation allows air to flow under the laptop.No issues so far with it"
1,battery has a defect,"just only 10 months with very short use, this battery does not work. not accept charge and is totally dead!! it is incredible that other customers write about the same thing and the product goes on sale!! I do not know the reason but is so strange that the defect exist in many items purchased."
2,Lasted 9 months,"Started using this battery in December 2009 and initially the battery was great...almost 4 hours of use before recharging needed. After 4 months it dropped to 2 hours of use before charging. Then it dropped to less than 1 hour. In August it stopped charging to full capacity, only to 36%, although it still says ""plugged in, charging"". It is September and I need a new battery...after less than 9 full months of use. Given the cost I expected better quality."
1,bad product,This product worked less than 3 months with very light usage. I would not purchase again.
1,Arrived DOA and replacement didn't last over 1 year,This sucks. First one arrived Dead on Arrival and the second one worked but died little under a year later. DO NOT RECOMMEND
3,"Started out great, but went downhill too fast.","I bought this in Oct of 09. In Dec of 10, I have 0 battery life left. It started out w/ a good 5 hrs of life and then decreased rapidly.By oct of 2010 I only had maybe 30 mins of battery life. I let the charge run down before recharging. I expected to get at least 18-24 mos before it started going down. Also I paid 80$ for it and now they are asking 105 to replace it. Ridiculous for something that doesn't even do what it's supposed to for very long. Frustrated and feeling very put out with HP batteries."
3,"Long Lasting, but the Cost","HP EV089AA 12 Cell Lithium Ion Battery for HP Pavilion DV6000 DV2000Since my previous battery had become ineffective in holding a charge, I decided to purchase the battery through Amazon.com. HP's catalogue costs were fine. It's the shipping cost that penny pinchers like me in Hawaiiare concerned with.I tryed out the battery and found that my machine was responding quicker and working better. The only other thing I was troubled with was the bulkiness of the battery. It fit in the slot but would not remain there if you moved around. That would make going to WIFI places a little difficult with your laptop.Again penny pinchers like me are concerned about the cost so I looked back at the Amazon catalogue a week after purchasing it and it had gone down about ten dollars.Economically the battery does all right even if it does not travel well."
2,Battery,The battery heats up a bit when I'm using my laptop and charging at the same time. I have to unplug it often so it will cool down.
4,Nice Battery!,"This battery lived up to what I expected that is most sure! Yes it is the size of two original batteries stacked on top of each other but I kinda like that since now it is elevated and is nicer to type on and gives the fan more room so it seems as it has been staying cooler than before. that is a plus! Shipping seemed to take forever, but it seems like if you pick the slowest method it always takes around a month to get to you. oh well, I love it and that is what matters. Lasts at least 3.5 to 4 hours. depends on how much i use it..."
2,Not the best battery life,"This battery is advertised as a 6 hour battery but on my HP Pavilion, this battery provides about 2 hours of computer life, even when I'm just running Excel. It is larger and does cause the laptop to be slightly raised in the back but I didn't find that to be problematic, just wish the battery life was a bit longer, as advertised."
1,Battery sucks,"HP EV089AA lasted less than a year. Very poor performance, just like the original battery (a 6 cell) that came with the laptop. Hopefully, Dr.Battery LHP200-GS will work better."
4,Of Questionable Origins,"First, let's consider the negative. This battery came wrapped in a plastic bag (as a new one would) but had no other packaging. I cannot be sure if it's new, remanufactured, used, sat on, played with, sung to, or otherwise. Additionally, the battery capacity is closer to that of the standard battery's claims -- four hours on a full charge.Now, let's look at the positive. This battery is made available at a reasonable price point. It's clearly labeled as an original HP battery and appears to be in physically new condition. While the capacity falls pretty significantly short of the full claim, it does work better than the factory provided battery's 2 1/2 typical performance.In the end, if you're not so concerned about your battery possibly being serenaded before being shipped to you and the original packaging isn't a big issue, this isn't a bad buy. I'd actually consider purchasing another one for price and acceptable performance alone."
3,Okay,Bulkier than expected. Left my laptop uneven with the battery tilting it. Does last a lot longer than my old one though so I can't complain.
1,Short Life,"Followed all directions in effort to maximize the battery life, however within 100 charges the useable hours between charges become very short.Don't buy this battery."
1,I won't rate it.,"I received this replacement battery for my HP Pavillion laptop. The battery just came in a bubble envelope...no box, etc. I attached it to my laptop and it would never charge the laptop. I had a battery store check it out and it is not putting out a charge. I need to return it. I contacted the company for a return label and they have sent me three emails wanting specific information about my laptop. I don't feel this is necessary because I gave it to them when I ordered the battery. This company is just stalling on letting me return it. I don't think that you (Amazon) should represent a company like this. I have ordered alot of things from you in the past and have always been very happy. This is ridiculous. I am NOT going to answer their substandard, stalling emails. I have bought a new battery and moved on as I needed my laptop. Please make this good for me. I just want to return it. Thanks so much for your help."
3,It works fine.,"Got this battery for my laptop. It doesn't last as long as I'd like, about 2 hours when not in constant use. But it's better than the 15-30 min. I got with my old one."
2,Be sure to check how well it holds a charge in 90 days,"After 100 days, mine is no longer holding much of a charge. Now I'm wondering if it was used...buyer beware. Be sure to test your battery products within the 90 day warranty period."
5,Love this Battery!,"This battery was well worth the price. I get about 4-5 hours of charge (constant use)- compared with only 2 for the 6cell I had previously. The slightly raised back was odd at first, but now I find the it is much easier to type and the extra space under the laptop helps to keep it cool. I would recommend purchasing this battery over the 6 cell. It is well worth it and I wish I would have done so earlier."
4,"Yep, works like it should",It works and has continued to work for well over a year which is better than the factory model did. No complaints here.
5,Battery life bliss,"After living with the standard battery for a long time, I bought this battery and jumped from 15 minutes of batter life to 4.5 hours at least. Very cool! As mentioned before this battery tilts the laptop upwards which provides for better ventilation. Double cool!"
4,hp battery,"It works well, I just did not expect it to bulge out. It is double the thickness so it sits higher in the back now. My son jokes that the laptop will now have better airflow. Don't know if this will help or hurt. I am happy that I have a battery that holds its charge for a decent period of time."
4,Great Product for a Great Price,I had mistakenly purchased what I thought was a replacement battery from a different site and it was a piece of crap...so I went to Amazon (my fave online shopping) and found the battery I needed but also the one I wanted!! It came in the usual quick time that only Amazon delivers and I was ecstatic that it was true HP brand and makes me feel better about hooking it up to my computer. And the fact that the price was cheaper than the HP site...that was just perfection!!
5,Good service - good battery,"I needed to replace the Lithium battery from my HP laptop. This battery was priced right, the vendor shipped it really fast, it works, I'm satisfied! Good deal all around!"
4,laptop battery review,Some reviewers stated they were able to experience nearly 5 hours of battery life. The most I have been able to get is 3 hours. The avg is more like 2.5 hours. K.
3,"Good for cooling, too!","I use this battery with dv2000. The laptop gets very hot sometimes and this battery helps air circulate underneath it. Battery life is excellent - minimum was 4 hours - since I had this battery a month ago. It's relatively heavy, though."
3,"Works, but not a perfect fit","While this battery works, it does not fit flushly into the battery slot of my HP notebook (something I should have figured out before purchasing). This causes the laptop to tilt towards you due to being elevated in the back. This is an annoyance for me."
4,Good Investment,I'm very happy with this battery since with my old one it wouldn't hold a charge for over a minute. This one has a very long battery life and I really don't mind how far it sticks out. It makes it easier to type for me while at my desk.
1,STAY AWAY,I bought this battery and it does not work. THEY DO NOT EXCEPT BATTERIES ON THEIR RETURNS LIST. STAY AWAY
5,Excellent Book on understanding the Song of Songs,This book is excellent and brings the reader into a more thorough and in depth understanding about the heart and the love of God. God's desire is to have intimacy with us.Often the Song of Solomon ( a book of the Bible) is looked at as just poetic imagery.This author shows that it is more than that. He desires for us to understand it's purpose.I feel that the author has mined the meaning and has put it out there for us to reflect on and to gain further understanding of this book of the Bible.
5,Jazz is Great in the Classroom,"Presentation Jazz provides readers with a unique visual approach to organizing sales presentations. Undergraduate and graduate students love it! I am using it in all of my sales classes.Michael Gamble, Ph.D. New York Institute of Technology, New York City."
5,Strange Discrepancy,"I read this book and thoroughly enjoyed it. Upon reading the reviews of others, I noticed a dichotomy. People either REALLY liked it or thought it was too simple. I also noticed that the reviews of the ones advocating its futility were by far SHORTER than the reviews by the ""happy campers."" While my judgement is, by far, not scientific, I am led to believe that those that thought of it as a simplistic work...simply missed the point. This book is very philosophical while still practical. Chaffee is well informed and ""preaches"" the virtues of a world where people who want to be informed, live as such. I'll keep my review short and ask you not to read this book like a novel, but, as Chaffee suggests, read it over an extended period of time allowing for the concepts to come to fruition."
3,A Solid Effort!,"John Chaffee encourages you to reach your full potential as a critical thinker and a creative thinker. He outlines ways you can improve your thinking and decision-making processes. It covers basic background information about the psychology of thought and encourages you to develop a rewarding, well-considered set of beliefs. The author discusses and evaluates stumbling blocks to critical thought, and then offers suggestions and activities for overcoming them. Though it is probably familiar to good communicators and occasionally repetitive, this material provides food for thought especially for those who are new to critical thinking. We [...] recommend this book to those who enjoy self-help books, and who want basic assistance in improving their thinking and communicating skills."
2,Reads like it was written for a 12 year old,"If you've never been to college, this book may be for you. However, if you are fairly well educated, this book will most likely do nothing but bore you, and you are well advised to avoid it as probably you have avoided the ranks of other shallow self-help books. There are many other books on this topic that are far better: simply do a search with the phrase 'Critical Thinking'."
2,I use this book everyday !!,"In fact, its near perfect thickness of 1.25"" (hardcover) is perfect for balancing uneven patio furniture."
5,Listen to Win (at home and in the workplace),"Listen to Win is a foundational book for your library. It offers a wealth of detailed information that will take a lifetime to apply. It is not a workbook, but it provides material that is transferable into the workplace on a day-by-day, hour-by-hour basis. It is very useful as a tool to improve your own listening skills and those of your subordinates. Currently it is out of print and not easy to find, but it is well worth the effort."
1,Please don't waste your money,"I was very disappointed with the pork cracklin's. They were completely inedible, so hard they couldn't be broken much less chewed. I have eaten bags of this product from other companies so I assumed these would be comparable. Unfortunately I was wrong. I attempted to contact the vendor, leaving several messages. We still have the box with the product and would be happy to return it to the vendor for a refund. I have shopped with Amazon for years and this has been my first unsatisfactory review."
4,Better than treo?? it depends on who uses it,"Good purchase, good buying for the price, but...CONS: pocket Win always is slower and you need to be closing apps to keep enough memory, BATERY! you have to keep charging everyday.PROS: good resolution, excelent idea the expandable keyboard, functionality super, nice apps online like CONTACTS PRO, EPOCRATES (for medics), SKYSCAPE software. Cool you can personalize sound callers, and put photo on it (Ctacts pro soft), good reception, no compatibility troubles using it with Latin America companie`s SIM.Always recomendable, it depends on you if consider better or not than treo.Have fun and try it!!"
4,Worth the money!,"For a smart phone, it is worth the money. It might be bulkier and heavier than you might want, but considering the price, I am happy with it."
2,sometimes it works sometimes doesn't,"Everything is good. The only bad thing which is more important than anything else, that this phone is unstable. Sometimes it doesn't recieve calls, has some problems with conection with personal computer and so on.I am about to sell it back."
4,Bulky but nice,It is nice phone but it is bulky and outdate. If you want camera opt for another phone.
1,Don't buy this demon possessed phone,"So, this phone is straight out of the excorcist. About 3 weeks after I bought it, I was at work and the phone randomly started dialing numbers. I turned it off and then back on, but the phone just started doing the same thing. It stopped after about 15-20 minutes but hass happened twice since then. Also, while it has a lot of cool features, you can barely hear the ring itself and the battery has to be charged EVERY night. I definitely would not buy this again."
1,piece of junk,This phone takes some time to figure out things. But still after I read all the manual there are problems I can't resolve. Contacted technical support several times with one answer upgrade the software although the software is the latest version. I can't press options once I call any number. Like if it says press 4 to to do something once pressed it says invalid entry. i switch to my old phone and it works fine so it is not the srvice it is the phone itself. I can't use any phone cards any options useless so far. Still trying to solve my problem.
3,Voq partial disappointment,"Ok phone, but there are some snags. It doesn't support MP3 files for ringtones and the ones with the phone are almost inaudible. The software didn't load on my laptop, so I can't sync any files. It's only a pity that Sierra Wireless doesn't provide any more support for this item. Getting a spare battery or other accessories is virtually impossible.Otherwise though, it sends and receives calls fine."
3,Difficult with T-Mobile service.,"I love the phone and all its features but am having trouble getting help from T-Mobile setting up the web functionality. This phone, it seems cannot acess the WAP services that is commonly known as T-Zones ($4.99 extra per month) rather you have to access the internet via a GPRS connection ($19.99 a month extra.) I would have never bought this phone had I known this incompatibality with T-Mobile. Let me know if anyone has any other remedy to avoid the GPRS $19.99 fee."
5,THIS IS AN AWESOME PHONE!,I have have over 50 different phones in the last 5 years. I am addicted to technology. This phone surpases every expectation I have had. I absolutely love it.
1,The calendar synchronization does not work.,The phone I got is defective. The calendar synchronization does not work between pc and cellphone. It always reset the clock on the phone. The phone is difficult to use.
4,How to be an artist,"I watched this film at the Guild Theater in Portland, Oregon. It retraces the events surrounding the mysterious death of artist Ray Johnson, with interviews of close friends and contemporaries, like Christo. Johnson was a performance and collage artist in the era of Lichtenstein and Warhol. In the tradition of Basqiat and art house documentaries, this film gives you an impression of the man behind the artist. (...)"
5,SPECTACULAR,"BOTH DOLLS ARE SIMPLY WONDERFUL! Gifts purchased them for my niece and I was delighted, they are cute IS REAL. HOW ARE ALSO PERFECT collectibles and are safe for handling. Was pleased with the purchase!!!!!!!!"
2,TWO AND A HALF STARS AT BEST,started out interesting... but after about 30 pgs or so the facts were pouring in so fast it was hard to keep track of what was going on. paragrapsh were wholly unrelated and there was no coherent picture developing just a jumble of facts with a ton of pictures (at least the pictures were beautiful to look at).i would have preferred to read something lengthier that gives a more wholistic and easier to follow story line.
5,Very Informative,"This has been a great introduction to a subject I've always been fascinated with, but have been intimidated by until now. A worthwhile read!"
2,This is a Picture Book!,"Okay, I got this book after reading and finishing a more concise history of the world power island European country. However, after flipping throughout the pages, I noticed that 60% of the book are pictures!Good - Gives a nice history of England. It basically covers the Prehistory, the Roman, Anglo-Saxon, Danish, and Norman invasions, feudalism, the Plague, the colonial era, War with Scotland, Spain, America, and France, and then the monarchy and England's half of the German invasions in World War I and II. Gives the reader a sense of people and places.Bad - As mentioned earlier, 60% of the book are pictures. And the pictures are not even in color, they're in black and white, which I don't mind, but they're not of the best quality. The book basically devotes a sentence or two to every event, which is concise, but I was expecting something more.Oh well, if you want a concise book, here it is.RATING: 2 stars **"
2,There's that crazy Wayne again,"OK, Bruce Wayne is obsessed. There is no other explanation for his relentless, cold-hearted pursuit of justice as the Batman. But he isn't insane.Darwyn Cooke, in ""Ego,"" gives us a Bruce Wayne who is still new in his role as vigilante. He is insecure, which is a side of Wayne rarely seen anywhere in his long history. And he is haunted by a giant shadowy Batman caricature, visually reminiscent of Oogie Boogie from ""The Nightmare Before Christmas."" Wayne has long conversations and arguments with his brooding alter ego, evidence that Batman is a separate personality rather than a mask. I'll admit, it's a take on the hero I don't like.Although the Batman entity is grotesque, the remainder of the art is fine. I enjoyed various insights into young Bruce's relationship with his parents and adult Bruce's relationships with his peers, but the psychobabble that otherwise dominated the book left me tired.by Tom Knapp, Rambles.NET editor"
4,if you like puzzles,builds slowly but at a satisfying rate. I thoroughly enjoyed an will watch more. Who is Albert Campion? I intend to find out
4,Fun to watch,"Campy and fun, sometimes serious. I enjoyed the old fashioned English manners and pretty countrysides. Cars and accents are very vintage."
2,Not so good,"Rather stay with Poirot it is really a much better production. Acting was good, but rest was really not up to same standard as Poirot,"
2,The Good & The Bad,If you love British TV and a good mystery and good story line ~ Get the Campion series. However this provider ASTRO VIDEO leaves something to be desired. One DVD in the set was visibly damaged in this Christmas present and although we have written to customer service on 3 occasions ~ we still have no response or resolution! I gues you have to take the good with the bad ~ so we have one mystery that has not been solved ~ how to get the bad DVD replaced.
2,Second rate,"This is an odd series. In the first film, Campion is a mysterious benefactor and crime fighter who seems to come out of nowhere when needed and uses different names. The Scarlet Pimpernel or something close to it. Thereafter, however, the stories are conventional, Campion has only one name, has roots within the British class system, and he lives in a town where everyone knows him. Discs two, three, and four are conventional mysteries. And they are not well done. Disc four, Death of a Ghost, is the worst. I thought I was watching high school actors at times. And the character of Campion, who seems feckless and gets beaten up, makes little sense. Peter Davison made a wonderful Trisan in ""All Creatures."" But his transformation into a detective does not come off. I discovered this earlier by watching ""The Last Detective."" He's strictly a light comedy man.In short, save your money. This isn't even worth your time."
1,Poor/Impossible recording quality,The first disc in the set was recorded so poorly I can not view it on my DVD. How do I replace one disc in a set?Deeply disappointing
1,Avoid this brand... read the fine print!,"I received this hitch and it bolted on very easily and appeared to be a very well made hitch. Well what I didn't know prior to ordering this hitch is that Curt requires you to use a supplemental towing strap in order to use this hitch with a hitch mounted bike rack. That is a deal breaker for me. 1) I bought this specifically to avoid mounting straps onto the paint of my car, 2) This is the ONLY major brand that requires this so it leads me to believe that they are not as durable as other brands since they require you use additional straps just to maintain your warranty.Sorry Curt, I'm not falling for it."
1,Deceptive track listing,Watch Out -- this CD only contains 14 unidentified tracks; not the 18 plus 5 identified by Amazon.
3,A book that had a confusing plot summary,"I believe that English teachers should make a list of books that teenagers could understand without having to rely on cheat sources. My advice to you would be to choose books that you can understand easily without driving yourself crazy while writting your critical analysis. Death of a Salesman is not one of those books that can be easily understood, in my opinion."
4,Hard to follow,"The only problem with this play is that it is hard to follow all of the flashbacks. Other than that it is very good, with many hilarious scenes."
2,Not Appropriate for Schools,"I studied this play for an independent study in 12th grade. I liked the play, but I don't believe that the topic is appropriate for influential students to be learning about. It teaches us that instead of trying to resolve our troubles, we should just give up, and leave our loved ones in the lurch."
2,i was disappointed,"I really loved the CD. However, this book was not good. I expected a lot more. The songs were simplified. The song I really wanted to play, Posession, was not the piano version on the CD. I think that it is not a good book to buy if one is a serious piano player."
3,Not very impressive,"I love Sarah McLachlan, but was disappointed in these arrangements. On quite a number of songs, the baseline consists of an endless succession of plodding, single-tone eighth notes, and nowhere do they ever write more than a single base note at a time; i.e., no base chords. There is also very little right hand movement beyond the melody line - no embellishments, and in many places there's nothing going on at all. Although the chords seem to be accurate, these arrangements are simplistic, lackluster, and boring. I've noticed that most of the time, piano arrangements of songs written and played on guitar tend to be less interesting, but Sarah plays piano as well as guitar, so I expected better.Yes, it's possible to pull out the recordings and write your own arrangement, but then, I bought the music so I wouldn't have to do that!"
5,Excellent Value for Money,"The Yamaha YRB-302B Bass Recorder is just the ticket for the two ensembles I play with. Both are beginner to intermediate ensembles that do SATB. Without the Yamaha option we'd need to be SAT. Acquiring a wooden bass recorder would have been prohibitively expensive, but with the Yamaha option we were able to get a bass player up and running.Another good thing about using the Yamaha for starter groups is that they take less maintenance than their wooden counterparts while delivering acceptable tone for a beginner groups. For an intermediate to advanced group I'd go with a Kung Superio model which delivers unbelievably rich tone in it's lower register - but it'll cost more than most beginner groups can afford.Let the Yamaha carry you through the first few years, get established and only then spend the big bucks on a wooden model."
4,"A little long winded, but worth it if you're a Berserker nut","I love Berserker stories, but I felt this novel sort of dragged through the human sub plots. There's a heck ofa suprise in the last fifty pages or so that made it worth reading, but when I re-read it I skimmed through a lot of it.Sorry, Fred.."
4,Worth the investment,"A captivating read for Berserker fans, with plenty of cool stuff revealed, especially at the end. [NO SPOILERS INCLUDED HERE!] However, I noticed redundancies cropping up occasionally in the narrative, which irritated me slightly. Additionally, the pace of the narrative wasn't up to Saberhagen's usually ""cracking good"" standards. Are Fred's writing abilities slipping only slightly with age?This story would make an excellent adaption to TV or film, but would probably work best as a story arc in part of an ongoing series, since the tale is best appreciated in the overall context of the Berserker saga (as is Saberhagen's short story ""The Sign of the Wolf"").The novel is a little draggy, and I was disappointed that Saberhagen killed off one of the supporting characters before he had a chance to really develop, but certainly not as hard to wade through as its immediate sequel, ""Berserker Fury"" (1997). Definitely worth the effort."
2,Rather lacking ...,"I must disagree with the other reviewers - While I DO like the berserker saga, simple fandom-appeal is no excuse for shoddy quality. The book IS too long, in many parts repeats itself ( you often get the same train of thought in three or four slightly different variations ), the plot confusing ( not complex, confusing ) and the characters come across as stilted. Still, it had enough nice ideas for me to finish it."
3,A long drawn out story,"Fred was paid by the word. The concepts put forth in this novel are smothered by this lengthy and almost boring style. The same dialogue is repeated over and over and over. I thought it must be a misprint, a broken press, what a lack of style, a Hemingway stuck in first gear. I thought the reader (me) would die before the Berserker. ."
3,"Great idea, good concepts, too disjointed.","The overall story was intriguing, especially the behavior of the ""Big Berserker"" ship. However there were too many inconsistencies in character actions and personalities, including characters that made the same mistakes over and over without seeming to learn anything from them, and many threads are left incomplete. The motive for Dirac's son's disappearance, for example, is left completely unresolved.I would read it again, but be prepared when you are done to go ""but wait, what about XXXX?"""
3,Fair Far-Future SciFi,"I've been meaning to start reading a Berserker Series story for some time, and was trying to determine the best place to start, and I ended up choosing BERSERKER KILL (1993).The book has a number of good space combat sequences, but bogs down at times with monotonous contemplations about the moral and ethical implications of raising human zygotes into adult humans for the sole purpose of implanting the memories of exiting adult humans... indeed the author must have grown tired of these contemplations, as the book suddenly changes tack halfway thru, and in Part 2 we find ourselves suddenly 300 years further into the future - and at least we get back into a more action-oriented mode.This story is now available as the third part of the omnibus BERSERKER DEATH, which is probably a better way to choose to start reading the Berserker Series."
3,Her second album,"Another reissue on Reunion/Uni. Replaced by RCA's edition in 1993. Released in 1979 for Christian outlets by Myrrh/Word Records. She was finishing high school and starting college between sessions on her sophomore effort. The title track was penned by her future first husband Gary Chapman, also an artist in his own right. I have the CBA edition on CD."
1,Toot the 70's.,"A failing actress slides into insanity on a Mexican movie set, the coke addled screenwriter arrives to lend assistance. The director, directors father, actress understudy, PR man, Mexican writer, all clearly 2 dimensional stock characters . This book is poor by every specification; characters drawn with such wide strokes that they are cartoons, speaking in running clichés. Characters from the movie ""Against all Odds"", setting from the movie ""10"". Throw in some errant Shakespearian quotations and a reference to an old Ernest Borgnine movie and you have what critics call ""richly literate"". By page 140 you are convinced that the book is a common stinker; but maybe Stone can pull it off in the last third.Don't waste your time. Its a failure in all aspects.Don't put this book on the shelf, put it under your dog dish.P.S. typo on page 207."
1,Turbie Twists are not the same,"I am very disappointed in the new turbie twists. I bought these for my wife, and the material is not as sturdy as the original, and they are not as long. They cannot keep her hair twisted up. Bring the original back please!"
3,it's so so,"It twists and holds in your hair well, but it's not very absorbant. I squeeze out all the water, and put the towel in my hair for like 15 minutes. When I remove it, my hair still seems quite wet.It's a pretty thick towel, so I cannot twist the towel very tightly, so maybe that's why it does not remove much moisture??Also - if your hair is semi-long (like mid back length), it will be too long to fit into the towel. I had another hair-towel prior to buying these, by Scunci, and it was MUCH better. I coudn't find that one again, so I got the Turbie Twist. It's an ok substitute."
5,Turbie Twists for the pool!,"I bought this item for my daughter to use at the pool and she loves the colors and the ease of use. She's only 7 so it's easy for her to use and not too much towel for her hair. But as an adult, I find it's still plenty of towel for my head, too.I received this item practically overnight. I ordered in the late evening and one day passed, then the next day I received it. It took less than 2 days from placing the order to having the product. I'm extremely happy with this seller."
2,Turbie twist shipped ripped product,"Received the product within specified ship date timeline. However, three of six items were ripped. Did not notice until ready to use product.Company needs to better inspect the product.No refund or exchange has been requested yet."
3,Comfortable but doesn't dry well,"i love how much more comfortable this is than a real (large, bulky) towel on my head, but it doesn't do much to absorb moisture. My hair definitely takes longer to dry after using this than it does after wrapping my head in a regular towel."
4,Great reference,"Not only is this a fantastic coffee table book, but it is a great reference for artists and photographer to reference styles in light, pose and wardrobe of some very vintage and influential moments in glamour and celebrity photography."
1,Buyer Beware,"I had to return this disc. I have never had a problem with anything I have bought from Amazon ever. The disc I was sent clearly has nothing on it. It looks just like a disc that doesn't burn right on your computer. It is completely blank. Shame on the seller for selling these to people. I might have believed this was a mistake, but then I saw several other reviews that complained about the disc not working. This seller is selling a product that is defective and has prior knowledge of it, yet they continue to sell it here. I am extremely disappointed as I was looking forward to this purchase.I will make it known to Amazon. This is ridiculous."
5,History!!,"I bought most of these magazines and I thought I would never read them again, memories flashed!! I recomend this product and this seller!!"
2,Poor image quality.,"I really wanted to enjoy this collection. I loved MAD magazine growing up. But the image quality of these scanned magazines is pretty poor. I haven't read through all 50+ years, but those issues I have looked through have been just barely legible. I expected better in this day and age of cheap, high-quality, digital reproduction."
1,Crappy Quality,"The Declaration of Independence looks pristine to these old fish-wrap pages.I half expected to find coffee cup rings and dried food that had fell from the mouth of the long ago reader of that particular issue.Shame on Mad Magazine for putting out such a low quality product,but they are the masters of squeezing out the last drop of blood from their loyal fans."
1,Huh ? Me Worry ?,"What the heck ?I have purchased this twice and both discs are blank..Alfred E. Neuman,are you involved ?I want this so badly,has anyone else experienced this ??"
4,Weaned on Mad magazine,"What a great trip down memory lane. MAD Magazine was the source of all that was funny in my young life. My parents considered it a bit subversive, which made it all the more delicious and enjoyable. Great source of creative visuals and satire, I adored and was probably politically molded and shaped by the MAD bunch of Idiots... and for that I owe them an incredible debt of gratitude.My only caveat, is the interface doesn't offer a handy search to locate what my fading memories barely retain from my childhood enjoyment. However, sifting through the complete catalog, issue by issue, does unearth gems completely forgotten. The web is also a handy resource for such directories, so not much complaining here, just lots and lots of laughter."
1,Mad about MAD - a missed opportunity,"I'll keep this brief. The other reviewers that have complained about the low-resolution of the scans are 100% correct. Make that 110% correct. The PDFs are of such low quality they are barely readable onscreen. This is a sad, sad disappointment. I can't recommend this collection to anyone, and I really, really wanted to like it. It's a grand idea, very poorly implemented."
4,Absolutely Nostalgic!,"This magazine started the same year I did. So the expectations for this products were high. PDF is the right format for this kind of project. You'll need a dual layer DVD ROM - it's a little over 7Gb in size. I'm very happy with the product and I should know, since I grew up on this (ig)noble publication! Congratulations to ""the usual gang of idiots."""
5,30Something Dollars and Some Change? Cheap!,"For those of us who'd grown up with Mad Magazine, the kind who ran to the variety story on the corner looking for every new issue (sometimes paying, sometimes not) and grabbed those special edition paperbacks off the racks (again, sometimes paying...), ABSOLUTELY MAD MAGAZINE: 50+ YEARS is something we all should have sitting on our shelves.The 2 DVD-ROM set spans the years 1952-2006, including issues 1-460, along with the XL and Super Special editions as well. As a bonus this collection contains video clips of interviews with the magazine's writers and the Spy vs. Spy animated shorts from the early days of the late-night comedy series Mad TV.The downside to this DVD-ROM set is minimal. Unfortunately, there are resolution problems with some the pages, especially with Sergio Aragones' Mad Marginals. Otherwise, this is an exceptionally comprehensive collection which will provide a longtime Mad Magazine fan with much nostalgia and enjoyment."
3,"Excellent Product, Terrible Packaging","This product is a comprehensive digital presentation of Mad magazine. It made a perfect gift for my father, who had all his original copies destroyed by his unruly children once we discovered them (30 year old magazines with ""fold-ins"" don't hold up well in the hands of eight year olds).The packaging is terrible, however. The item arrived damaged but I do not see any way it could not have been, based on the design (all paper, double thick in all the wrong parts, ready to be smashed into an accordian-like thing in the mail). The DVD was inserted into the packaging but had come loose. It needed to be cleaned before being played due to scratches.If there is a second edition, I would look to the recent digital re-prints of Rolling Stone and Playboy for better packaging ideas.Still, the DVD itself was well worth the price."
5,Recommended by a man of cloth.,"I remember scraping together pennies and nickles from my paper route to buy the magazine with the homely character on the cover ($.50, Cheap! (where's the cent symbol on this keyboard?!?)). It always had me laughing. It is here that I leaned the meaning of the word satire.I was also astonished when, during a parent meeting, one of my Catholic High School teachers actually RECOMMENDED that we read MAD magazine (I think he was trying to stear us away from National Lampoon). Whatever, this magazine is still enjoyable, and I have passed the tradition down to my teenage son.I now must sift through the actual advertisements, and I do miss Don Martin's unique views of the world. But the new MAD still entertains.How can you go wrong with 50 years of MADness for only $50 (Still Cheap!)."
1,Need An Updated Version For Windows 7 & 8,"As much as I have been a loyal devotee of MAD Magazine since the 1970s, I cannot recommend the purchase of this DVD-ROM, since it is incompatible with newer versions of Windows, such as the current Windows 7 and the soon-to-be released Windows 8, due this Christmas. Time Warner needs to get with the times and offer an updated version of this package so that all fans can enjoy MAD Magazine's brand of brilliant humor instead of being left out in the cold, uttering ""What--They Worry?""."
2,A Second Generation Disappoinment,"Before there was a National Lampoon, there was Mad Magazine. Us Baby Boomers grew up with it. It was our first taste of satire and critical thinking. And Mad Magazine has not outlived it's usefulness as did the National Lampoon. Mad still satires today as good as it did yesterday, although most of the original cartoonists and editors have died.Years ago, Broderbund came out with a 7 CD ROM package of all the Mad Magazines printed. It had a superior user interface which quickly located every article and cartoon in the collection. It even had every fold in and sticker collection. And it had the infamous MAD songs included.This DVD collection is a poor substitute. It claims also to have all the stickers- I've yet to find them in the collection. Compared to the Broderbund collection this version is boring and a pain to search.This is a case where so called improved technology made a disaster of one of the funniest magazines in existance."
4,Just got it today,"I just recieved this lovely item in the mail today and I see just a few things wrong with it. The magazines are all in pdf format so for me it's a little difficult to navigate...but I'll get the hang of it eventually. It's a great magazine and a great buy for the money if you LOVE mad and have to have ALL the issues through 2005, but I would suggest if you already have the older version of mad on cd-rom then stick with that until you are through and then switch to this one to read the rest. I love the fact that when you put the disc in it actually seperates the magazines into decades for you and it also seperates the special issues from the regular issues. PDF format is ok for some people, but I liked the way the other version handled just fine."
3,At Least It's All There,"Poorly scanned, though. And not enough resolution to enjoy reading on a computer. Nor to print well. But at least it's all there on one DVD."
4,"Its is over 50 years of MAD Magazine, 'nuff said","It is 50 years of MAD, a must own for any fan. Its like having every issue, plus you can search for things. Brings back many good memories."
2,Terrible scan quality,"It's great to have all these Mad magazine issues on a single disc, but the scanning quality STINKS. I compared some original paper issues from 1978 to their scanned versions, and the difference is huge. The scanned text is blurry, and the pictures just lose their appealing qualities. Whatever scan resolution Git-Corp used, it wasn't good enough.I own several other Git-Corp DVD-ROMs (for Marvel comics) and love them. This Mad DVD is a dud."
4,What I expected,"I downloaded this onto my iPad for a few workplace chuckles at Lunchtime when I am away from wifi. Downloading from DVD to iPad via iTunes was Not an easy process. I really hate iTunes for that. I enjoy the wacky Movie Satires, and all the oddball cartoons. 50 bucks is a bit steep, but where else are you going to get all the past issues of this unusual satire magazine?"
2,Unusable,"Tint is good quality, is marked properly, but I can't use it since the tint was creased when it was packaged. I ended up buying local tint and using this as an expensive template."
4,"Cruising, Romance and Mystery: what more do you need?","I love cruising and reading mysteries about cruising. On recommendations from other cruise enthusiasts' I downloaded Dressed to Keel to my Kindle. I couldn't be more delighted with this book and Candy Calvert's writing.The background and setting is fun and entertaining. I thoroughly enjoyed Ms. Calvert's descriptions of cruising and the ports of calls. The characters are interesting, totally believable and witty. The story itself was well written and easy to follow. Ms. Calvert has the ability to combine romance, mystery and action very well.If you're looking for a fun, lighthearted mystery, download this today. I personally can't wait to read the next book in the series on my Kindle."
2,Sort of Boring.,"I really had a hard time getting into this book. I didnt appreciate alll the nursing lingo - kind of like the author showing off her expertise? It was distracting. I also thought that the story was slow and while the ending had a nice twist, there really wasnt enough suspense. I will not read another in this series."
3,"If you love to go on Cruises, You will enjoy this book!","I have all 3 of Candy Calvert's Books and did enjoy her first Book ""Dressed to Keel"". As a person who has done many cruises, I enjoyed the fast read of this book. I do however, have to give it 3 stars because the story could have really been told in about 4 chapters! The book was enjoyable to read and because I like cruising I read it in 2 days!"
5,Fun Summer Read,"This is a great mix of humor, romance and mystery!I found myself laughing out loud at some of the predicaments Darcy and Marie get themselves into. These two characters are relatable, lovable and hilarious you'll find yourself rooting for them to find the thief!"
5,Rollicking Romantic Mystery,"From prow to stern--I mean, beginning to end--this is one hilarious, madcap adventure at sea. Calvert combines her medical and cruise knowledge with a distinct flair for story-crafting."
5,Dynamite Summer Read!!!!,Candy Calvert has written the perfect book for vacation reading. I enjoyed her characters--I felt I knew them when I finished. The plot moved along nicely with funny twists and turns. I even giggled out loud!! Definitely a fun read!!!
5,Fun at sea,"Ms. Calvert has created realistic characters with quirks and lovable attributes and then made the reader care about them. Laugh out loud funny at times and donwright scary at others. I loved the atmosphere of a cruise ship because I've never enjoyed one, but the details made me feel like I was there."
4,"Light, and airy","Great book to read on vacation, easy read and made me feel like I was on the cruise ship with them."
5,Exciting book!,"Great little book! Enjoyed being able to finish it quickly as I am not a huge novel reader. Kept me interested all the way through. Great author, loved the nurse input as I too am a nurse. Kudos to Candy!"
5,Best cover for the older iPod's.,"I have the older iPod shown here, I would probably never put one of those new ones in a case, because I think they are beautiful. However, I love the fact that my iPod is now black, this comes with a cover for the screen, that protects it, and if the cover gets lint on it, just simply wipe it off with a damp cloth. I use the iTrip with mine, and after breaking the case in, I have no problem with it coming loose. This is the best investment you can make for the older iPod's."
1,Never Recieved Product,Terrible. Wholesaler club should be put out of business. My order was never sent out. I waited about a month before i realized it wasn't coming...
3,Good but..,"I just put my 30gig Ipod photo into this case and it is pretty much what you'd expect. The 30gig just fits (size A). The cover for the screen is a very clear, hard piece of plastic you insert. It is definitely attracting some lint etc. and not an improvement on the look of the ipod (I got the carbon color). Also, the belt clip is very flimsy and completely plastic. The instructions state that it is not meant for ""vigorous activities or exercise."" I feel safe that his case will protect my ipod and it makes the ipod very grippy. Not perfect, but probably the best out there in terms of size, style and protection. Should be about half the current price. If you want something to run with, get an armband."
4,Pwned,"I'll keep this short and sweet. This case is everything you could want it to be. It provides a good grip, the screen guard stays perfectly in place and looks great, it gives good access to everything on the iPod you could want access to... the ONLY downside to this that keeps it from being a 5 star rating for me is the fact that it is a bit of a pain to remove/put on. While I don't particularly CARE about this, it does mean that because the case gives the iPod a little more size, it won't fit comfortably into most close-fit docking devices that you can buy for the iPod, plus the little flip cover over the port on the bottom of the iPod can get in the way of even those port devices it CAN fit into. There are ways around this, such as getting an iTrip for your car rather than a docking-style device, etc. Overall, I'm VERY happy with this case, and despite the little downsides I won't be trading it out for anything."
2,bordering on inadequate,"I got mine yesterday. First of all, the look is very cheap, the black color is spotchy and gray in some spots. Second, this has NO screen protection. I knew the click-wheel would be exposed, but there is no reason not to have a screen cover. And third, it's not a molded fit, as someone wrote in an earlier review. In fact, the fit is quite loose and given the openings for the screen and clickwheel, there is full potential for stuff like dust or crumbs to get inside. I have a 4th generation 20Gb Ipod with color screen (U2 edition), so presumably this is the model that the iskin was specifically designed for. Considering the price, it is a total rip off, I wouldn't recomend this product."
3,OK,"This soft collar was more than I expeted,but is ok for mild cervical pain.I would like more firm for a better inmovilization."
3,KINDA SORTA OK,"IM A BIG MAN, 6 FT 4 , 285. ,I HAVE A 22 INCH NECK. IT WAS REAL TIGHT, AND I GOT THE XLARGE. I GOT IT TO SEE IF IT WOULD HELP KEEP MY NECK STRAIGHT AND CHIN UP AND HELP WITH SNORING. I COULD NOT USE IT CAUSE IT WAS TOO TIGHT ON MY THROAT. IT ALSO SEEMED A BIT SOFT TO PROVIDE ANY REAL SUPPORT."
4,Neck Support,This item helped to give me support while I was healing from ruptured cervical discs. I did not have injections or surgery. I went natural with stretching and light exercise. It was very painful in the beginning. I would wear this collar while driving or sleeping. It made those activities tolerable.
4,works,I am post op cervical laminectomy and this brace helps the discomfort from tired neck syndrome after a surgery like this. I shopped around and the price is right
1,Soft piece of crap,"It's basically wrapped soft foam and gives no support of your neck what so ever. Try something else, this doesn't do a thing other than make your neck sweat."
2,soft cervical collar,This soft foam cervical collar lacks the appropriate support. I did not have any relief by wearing it. My chiropractor suggested wearing a cervical collar for the long hours that I spend on the computer. I ended up buying another collar for the same price from his office.
2,Not sure about this one,"I read the reviews and expected more from this item. I've used it here and there but not daily because I didn't really see the difference. It wasn't too expensive, but for the price I expected this item to at least help a little. The size was fine, but the fabric covering the foam is cheap and is starting to run. The foam is too soft. I would have liked the foam to be a bit more densed so that maybe it could make a difference. I'm wearing it right now because I am testing it to see if it will help my neck problems at all or not when I am using the computer.I will update later."
5,Gentle Support,I have cervical stenosis and have a lot of neck pain and radiating pain and numbness into my arms. This is just the right support to keep my head and neck in proper alignment for use while sitting at the computer.
3,50-50,"does not support your neck very well. specially your back of neck, where it is more susceptible for neck problem. It should have been more firm"
2,Too soft,"This product is too soft to be of any help. It does not give me any support, so it is useless."
2,Disappointed...,"I was intrigued by the synopsis of this book but after reading it all I felt was disappointment.The story follows a divorced mother who has recently ""lost"" her oldest daughter. The plot weaves around her anguish, which was really the only selling point in this novel, and the unraveling mystery. Unfortunately it isn't much of a mystery, certainly not one worth solving. The father's cavalier attitude throughout the book helped me to figure out the ending about mid way through.Don't waste money on this one."
1,Disappointed!!!,"Joy Fielding was one of my favorite authors. Until I read this last book. I was not thrilled with Whispers and Lies, but looked forward to Lost. It appears that her talent has run out. Two books in a row that failed to capture my attention; I skimmed the last 100 pages of Lost. Character development is poor; these people are not even likeable. It will be a long time, if ever, before I'm picking up a Joy Fielding book again. It was good while it lasted."
3,"Yes, it's stupid","Yes, this book is really stupid, pretty poorly-written, has a terrible plot, and moronic characters, but somehow I stayed up way too late to finish it. So it must have had something going for it, even if I can't put my finger on what that something is..."
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"This is one of the worst novels I've read in a long time. It somehow manages to be worse than ""Whispers & Lies"" by this same author, which initially seemed impossible. The plot is asinine and the characters are odious and the book is purely a waste of time."
1,Lousy Story,"Too bad this has not even reached the level of mediocrity. A bad book and reading it was a big mistake. The plot is asinine, the characters comtemptable and how anybody could actually enjoy this book is a mystery to me."
2,lost,"The book is about a mother trying to find her adult daughter who has unexplainedly disappeared. I never understood why the mother was so upset so soon over the absence of her adult daughter given that the girl was prone to selfish self centered acts. Yes, they had a troubled past but come on, this was so ""over the top."" Secondly, this was a pretty lame romance. The whole story could have been told in 150 pages or less. I forced myself to finish it because I hate to waste money but after the first 200 pages I skimmed the rest."
1,This book is so lousy I have to write a review,"It's just....hahaha! I have never read anything THIS STUPID. But I somehow finished it? And, by the end, I have to write this review."
2,Disappointing,"I look forward to anything by Joy Fielding, and was disappointed in this effort. The plot was transparent and contrived, the characters overly-selfish, and Cindy, the primary character, was over-reactive and immature. The sub-plot between Cindy and her younger daughter Heather, was never fleshed out, though it had potential to be very emotional and moving.The ending was predictable and unsatisfying..."
1,Lost,421 pages of repetitive nonsensical drivel. Character's unworthy of caring about & the author bangs you over the head with the same thing continuously. Very boring. I have 2 other books by this author & am considering not even opening them. I'll watch TV if I want to be bored.
2,She's Lost? What a break!!,"I'm just to page 78 and I am already tired of this book. When is Julia expected to grow up? She's 21 for pete's sake. Cindy get's an award for the most ditsy mom.Agonizing over a 21 year old that stayed out all night without calling and allowing her 18 year old daughter to live at home with her boyfriend.When I was 21 I had been married for 3 years had 2 children by choice and stayed married to my husband faithfully until he died. I know this is not your average story these days, but is everyone as dysfunctional as Ms Fielding portrays?Only my time is invested in books as I use the library exclusively or receive books from friends."
2,Disappointed as well,"I always enjoy Joy Fielding's books for a light read. I didn't care for this one, though. As a couple other reviewers already said; after reading about halfway through the book it wasn't hard to figure out what the ending would be. There was a lot of useless info; I felt like there were a lot of pages but not a lot actually happened. Basically it was hashing and rehashing of the relationship between an overly worried mother and an overly self-centered daughter. If you like Joy Fielding, stick with her other books. I'm glad I only got it from the library, but I was so disappointed in it that I had to do a review of it here. I'm not surprised that so many others have the same opinion."
3,AVERAGE FIELDING BOOK,"We are all dysfunctional in our own way so don't judge this too harshly. The back and forth between mother and teenage daughter is painful, but anyone who has raised teen girls can attest that it can get brutal at times. This is a page turner because you care what happens, but not much does, so the book becomes just an average read. Borrow from the library or from a friend and don't purchase--not good enough to keep and re-read in a few years."
1,Lost,"I have read just about all Joy Fielding's books and enjoyed them all. However,I was looking forward to reading this book but it let me down. The ending I thought was terrible.Pam"
1,A complete waste of time,"I've never written a review of book on Amazon, but this novel was so awful that I felt duty bound, as an avid reader, to warn my fellow readers to stay away. I have read some novels that I have been less than thrilled with, but this takes the cake. It is almost laughable how horrible this book was, by far the worst book I have ever read."
2,Predictable and Trite,"I have read and enjoyed many of Fieldings previous novels. Not so, LOST. Although I cared about the main character Cindy, her remaining daughter and family, I couldn't have cared less if the missing daughter was found or not. The missing daughter seemed spoiled and - well mean. I expected a mystery, I guess, with the mother tracking down the clues, and although she did do some investigation on her own, she mostly waited for her daughter to come home. In the course of the story she meets the perfect man (of course) who helps her though everything. Please."
2,Weak ending!,"I thought the book was good but with all of the build up, I wanted a spectacular ending and it just wasn't. It was a total let down for me and I wished I didn't bother to read. I think it had the potential, it just didn't follow through at all."
1,THE ENDING RUINED THE WHOLE BOOK,"NO SPOILERS - This book was pretty decent throughout... it had me guessing what could've happened to Cindy's daughter, Julia ... Did their neighbor kidnap her? Did the Hollywood producer kill her? Did her ex-boyfriend have her tied up and tortured? Did her sister's creepy boyfriend have her bound and gagged somewhere?I admit, it hooked me..... I just had to know more, I was furiously reading trying to find out what happened to Julia, where was she??? In my mind, I couldn't wait to give this book 5 stars!! Then BAM! That horrible ending! I felt so manipulated, cheated and angry I just wanted to sling that book across the room. I was so angry at the author for all that build-up and suspense, buidling up our emotions like that only to cheat us out of a realistic ending. The ending totally negated everything good about this book. I would NOT recommend this to anyone! Do NOT waste your time."
1,Mom is a hopeless twit,"I kept waiting for the mom, Cindy, to stop being a hysterical, hopeless twit, or at least to start being a good mom. Didn't happen. The ending was so obvious from the first time dad came on the scene, I thought I must be wrong. I wasn't and the whole thing was resolved in a totally unrealistic way. There were moments that, I guess, kept me going but I was angry with myself at the end for wasting my time with this book."
1,Don't read on Kindle,"I've loved these books since I was a kid for their ability to capture a (rather idealized) vision of a time and place, but the KIndle edition is so terrible that I can't believe they're allowed to charge money for it. It not only doesn't have the pictures (whatever), but it's missing a lot of punctuation, including ALL the apostrophes, and suffers from random breaks in the lines. soitsall fineif youd like to know about Maryfredsnew horse. Hell cost her a lot of money, butshellfigure it out.I was so excited about my new Kindle but not if books are going to be sold that are input so carelessly."
5,Almost all you need to understand the healthcare debate,"This is a very easy to read book, but contains a wealth of subtle thinking about what's really going on with healthcare. The debate about healthcare is complicated. The underlying economic issues are perhaps less complicated. In fact, there is a little bit of ""Emperor has no clothes"" aspect of this book in revealing what is really going on. There is a lot of wishful and magical thinking going on in the healthcare debate and you shouldn't read this book if you want to hang on to your illusions about healthcare. Of all the stuff being written on healthcare today, I predict this book will hold up very well and look prescient in ten years."
4,Crisis of ABundance,It's not as easy of a read as I expected but I believe that it is inciteful and accurate.
4,Reading it on the Kindle,"I'm reading this book on the Kindle (and writing this review from the Kindle, also). The content is well-presented and mostly understandable to a noneconomist. The author presents various econommic considerations to deal with the issues with good examples. The only drawback with reading the book on the Kindle is that the publisher did not hyperlink the notes and references from within the body, making it difficult to move around from text to reference and back."
4,Music is great - sound quality: weak,"This review is for the original 1990 CD release - not the remaster. I recently purchased this used, being one of my favorite solo Beatle records from the 80's - the songwriting & Jeff Lynne production are really a great fit but if you want this album now, you really need to get the 2004 remaster because this 1990 version is very light on the low frequencies. I can't imagine how such poor mastering was allowed to be released."
4,Just Float Along,"What a fine album this one is. One of Harrison's best. ""Cloud Nine"", ""This Is Love"" and ""When We Was Fab"" are some of George's best work. ""Got My Mind Set On You"" is a really strong song but it got a little over-played at the time. The best of the second tier is ""That's What It Takes"". You better believe this CD is a buy."
3,Lynnesc Harrison,Nice album which sometimes sounds a bit too much like ELO. The album contains a number of great songs and a large number of nice ones. The latter would have sounded better if the influence of Jeff Lynne had been curtailed some more. All in all it is a nice album but certainly not George's best.
2,ONE Great Harrison Song!,"I've listened to this CD almost 10 times & I'm NOT hearing the Five Star review level the vast majority of reviewers have given Cloud Nine. ""Got My Mind Set On You"", is a Five star ""Beatles"" level song & production. Its so good it makes you wonder whether the rest of these tunes were from another recording session. Loaned this CD to another George/Beatles fan & he was also NOT impressed beyond the one song. Felt it was too much like a 1980's ELO record. SORRY!"
5,One of his best albums!,"It's really ashame that this album is out of print, lucky for me I got it used a while a back. This album has one of Harrisons most well known solo song ""Got My Mind Set On You"" though it's good but it's not the best song on this album, that honor goes to Someplace Else and Just For Today. The two songs just mentioned sound as if they could of been on Georges first true solo album All Things Must Pass. All the songs are strong on this one. That's What It Takes is also a favorite of mine. Overall all the songs are pretty great on this album and it should be re-realese along with most of George's solo work."
5,George's Best Work,"It seems to me that the chief complaint about this album is the production. That, however, is the least of my concerns. I prefer to listen to the music itself, and pay close attention to the lyrics. The song ""Just For Today,"" for instance, speaks to me. It is a song that I can relate to. George seems to bring that quality out in a lot of his work.And the rest of the album is wonderful too. ""Fish on the Sand,"" ""Devil's Radio"" and ""When We Was Fab"" are excellently rocked out. It just kicks, plain and simple.This album is one of the few that I can listen to, beginning to end, without skipping a single song. This is George's masterpiece. I'm sure I'll take heat for this but I like it better than ""All Things Must Pass."" I am not in to religious music that much; I like good, old-fashioned rock and roll. And on this album, George delivers just that, with flying colors.This album is a joy to listen to. If you listen to it, you too will be on cloud 9."
3,3.5 Stars - More of the George I Know,"There are a handful of good songs here, but most of it is what I would deem typical George. Hey, I love George and the Beatles, but he was appropriately relegated to 1 or 2 tracks per album, because his songs generally don't measure up. Yes, there are many great exceptions to my generalization, but this album isn't one of them. The song ""When We Was Fab"" is an exception. I always get kind of choked up on that one, but apart from that track and ""Got My Mind Set On You"" the rest of the album is decidedly 3 Star stuff. Hey, if you can pick it up for cheap then I would. I did."
5,Love My Tape!,"I received my like-new cassette in perfect condition and in a very timely manner. Great job, perfect transaction!"
5,Excellent product,"As I would expect from Hagen, a good product, fresh and quickly delivered. This was a very good price also, compared to other baby bird food on the market."
1,Ridiculous,I've been using video tapes daily for 8 or 9 years; I've lost weight and inches. With Amy Bento I lost patience. She usually tells you what to do after she starts doing it leaving you flat-footed which may be preferable to her not telling you about weight shifts or directional changes. Do not use this tape if you have a slightly sore knee or if you don't want one. What a waste of time and money.
2,Bad cueing,I am an advanced exercise person who also has music training. I feel I can follow most anyone. Amy cues you after the fact and I found this difficult to follow. There's no building up to any moves - it's just full out do it and try to keep up. I get too frustrated with this video to even want to bother with it. That's bad.
1,Four Left Feet,"Wow, I doubt I will ever play this DVD again. I got it yesterday and played it for the first time today. Turned it off after 5 minutes. Husband was laughing pretty hard. Not everyone knows how to do a ""sashay... grapevine..., 360 turn, etc."". I couldn't follow it. Moves too intricate; requires a lot of coordination. Sadly I don't have it."
4,"Pretty good, a little hard to follow","I read previous reviews on how she is quite hard to follow. I am pretty coordinated so I decided to give it a shot. Very high intesity, good workout. You do have to do the steps a couple of times before getting the hang of it. Her voice can get a little annoying, she changes it into this deep creepy voice sometimes. Gets a little on the nerves, but good solid workout."
1,Sq Footage required,"All I can say about this workout, is that you'll need an airplane hanger to use it.Good Luck!!"
5,Amazing!!! My new exercise love...,"I quit my membership to the gym because I was getting ""stuck in a rut."" I read some helpful positive reviews on Amazon.com about Amy Bento. I was doing pilates, yoga and ""Buns of Steel"" DVD's, but I needed some fresh cardio! I bought Hi-Lo Xtreme and Kickboxing Xtreme. I absolutely love Amy Bento. She is inspiring and upbeat. If you are in a hurry you can select different ""NRG mixes."" The shorter one is about 33 minutes long. On my days off, I will do the whole DVD. This is definitely an advanced workout and I like how she doesn't break down the combos too much. If you fumble, you can just bounce around get yourself back on track. There are a lot of traveling moves in this DVD, but you can do them in place. Also, sometimes, I do not feel like jumping, so I will do the modified versions. This DVD is a must for any fitness library!"
5,The best Tuning Keys you can get,"These tuners, often private labeled are the best tuers money can buy - as far as I'm concerned. They stay in tune and adjust smoothly and easily and with the precision needed for harmonic tunings. There is no better. Expensive yes, but no better available."
5,Fusion heaven,"The first thing that struck me about this book was the beautiful edition - the illustrations really set the tone for the eclectic recipes they accompany. The recipes themselves obviously draw on a wide and varied background in cooking (and travel?)- bringing together ingredients and techniques from various European, Asian and American styles of cooking. I loved the Goat Cheese Napoleons, the Cucumber Wheels with Crabmeat and Sushi Rice, and scored major brownie points with my husband with the Cardamom Pears. Although this is not a beginners cookbook, the instructions are very clear and precise and I would encourage anyone with a sense of adventure as far as good food is concerned to dive into these recipes."
5,The proof is in the eating,"The proof of a cookbook is not in its illustrations, layout, or prose; it is in the eating. I've had the Duck Breasts with Apples and Cider Sauce (p.33) and the Grilled Chicken Breasts with Tomatillos (p.35). Both were delicious. This lady knows cooking."
1,Fail during installation,Ceramic tips came loose during initial installation.Not my idea of a rough service component.How hard can it be to manufacture these correctly?
3,"Does the job, cheap, not very long lasting","I use these bulbs in a pair of 1000W stands. They do the job well, fairly inexpensive but it seems like every time I set up the lamps I'm changing a bulb. Good reason to buy the large, more cost-effective 6 packs."
5,"A Species Odyssey, simply amazing","On the base of the last theories and scientific deductions, of which those of Yves Coppens (anthropologist, he is one of the co-discoverers of Lucy), film's co-author, and the use of the best technologies as regards 3D animations, 'A Species Odyssey' recalls, with care, the formidable evolution of the human race, from its animal origins to the man such as we know it today. This documentary of quality transports us million years ago, thanks to meticulous work of hundreds of people, one is touched by the images and the adventures of our ancestors. Simply amazing!!"
5,Great knives!,"My wife & I decided on these and they work fine. Stay sharp, good finish & they look good!"
3,Not in the same class as Oxo's 8 inch professional chef's knife,"Oxo's 8-inch professional chef's knife has won countless contests - surprising reviewers who were skeptical that a $20 knife could perform better than $75 and $150 German competitors. And I'm a believer.So I was very disappointed by Oxo's 6-inch professional chef's knife. The grip is terrific. The blade shape is excellent, and the blade is capable of being very sharp. But there's just not enough metal in the blade. Simply put: it doesn't work as well as you'd expect if you've used the larger version - which is my favorite knife.If you want to be astonished, buy Oxo's larger model. You'll be dazzled. But if you're looking for something smaller, this knife isn't it."
4,This knife is good but there are better for this price,"This is a good knife but you can find something better for this price. Victorinox is better IMO.It doesn't come sharp enough from factory and is made in China. Again, it is a good product but you can find something better if you look and research. German brands are better, IMO."
3,Good value - but it's still a cheap knife,"I'd agree with most other reviews - the handle is nice and the blade chops food. But it does feel like a $15 knife - don't expect a Sabatier for this price. The metal feels too light for me (weight does help chopping veg), and there's a roughness to the blade's edge that doesn't feel 'high quality' to me.So it's OK, but I'll probably spend a bit more on a different brand when this gets blunt."
4,Chop-o-holic,"This is a nice all purpose kitchen knife that is the perfect size. It's big enough to get the job done, but not bulky or awkward at all. I'm not much of a chef, but on the occasions I do cook anything that requires a fair amount of chopping, this is the knife I reach for first."
3,A little disappointed......,"The cookbook is really nice regarding the recipes. However, the picture that was on the ad did not show that the binding between the front cover and the back of the book was split in half. It, of course, doesn't affect the recipes but I was very disappointed when I noticed the 'defect' in the book."
4,"Slight slip from the last 3 albums, but still worth a listen","Herbie's last HEADHUNTERS-era disc that is still a fairly rewarding one for those open to his mid-'70's fusion of jazz with progressive funk/r&b. As with the previous few discs, Hancock and Maupin in particular get ample solo space, with Herbie still trying to integrate his talent for improvisation with his vision for genre-hopping. The music is a bit lighter in texture than the prior three albums in this style, and the repetitive semi-vocal track DOIN' IT hints at the rapid musical decline to come. Nonetheless, check this CD out if you are into HH's 1973-1976 period."
2,Herbie loses his edge,"While ""Head Hunters"" sounds very innovative for 1973, by the time of 1976's ""Secrets"", Hancock has slipped into mainstream disco pop. ""Doin' It"" is a plodding, repetitive dance tune with cheesy background vocals. The remake of his own ""Canteloupe Island"" lacks the creativity of his re-made ""Watermelon Man"", sounding a lot like TV background music. ""People Music"" saves this record from a one-star rating, it seems it would be much more at home on ""Mr. Hands"" than this collection of forgettable music.Unless you're a Herbie completist, pass on this one."
1,Do not buy this,"I thought I would buy this knock-off item and save a few bucks. The item is really cheap looking and did not work at all. I would recommend the real Nikon Remote instead of this. Also note that there are numerous buttons on this device but only one of them is for the Nikon, the rest are for other cameras."
2,"Worked for awhile, broken when received","Bought this quite awhile ago, and I didn't notice at first, but the battery tray is stuck in and I am unable to change the battery. I'm not being dainty about it either, I can pull with everything I've got and the battery tray will not come out.Even before the battery died the remote had an awful range and only worked intermitently.The product feels cheap and gets scuffed up easily.I would not buy this again, and I will be buying an official one next."
5,Much better then I reasonably expected. Excellent overall,"Good product. I was worried to buy non-brand product for D80, but decided to give it a shot as I have also a Canon S60, which is old and I would never buy remote for it otherwise.I got the unit with looks differently then current picture. It has no words at all, only little subscripts N,C, KM (apparently standing for Nikon, Canon and Konika Minolta.The only one button sub-marked N works perfect for Nikon D80 and one of several marked with C works for Canon. Zoom for Canon doesn't work and I do not care.Great combo and even looks not as cheap as it could.Range wise:I tried it with both my cameras and it perfectly worked at 10+ft range. Of course I have no way to compare with other remotes, but Canon was more readily responsive, Nikon had to be on the right side of a sensor. Nikon has a large lens which might screen out infrared signal though.I would attribute range and receptiveness to to the camera, not to the remote."
3,opteka rc-7 wireless remote for d40x nikon,this item says it is for a nikon d40x slr. I still have not figured out how it works. Perhaps it is me. I definitely need help with this.
3,Wireless Remote,"I have no idea if this even works because it arrived with no battery ""juice"". According to the instructions that were sent with it, all that a user needs to do is remove the tag between the battery -- however, there was no tag and consequently, it doesn't work. I will buy a new battery to see if it works but if it doesn't -- I won't be buying from this company again."
2,Wireless Remote,"I guess it probably works, but the instructions suck. I bought it to use with a Nikon D40. Threw it in the trash because I couldn't fighure it out."
5,Great Memories!,"Who knew this game was still for sale. I used to play this game often with cities I had created using SimCity 2000. It was a great flying sim, it was fun, and it was funny, as many of Maxis's games were.I remember it having a few minor bugs but there were work around for each of them."
4,Not too bad,"I purchased ""Skil 94100-05 Pruning Reciprocating Saw Blades"" specifically to use in pruning a flowering pear and a couple live oak trees. Since none of the branches have a diameter greater than 5 inches I thought they would work. Turns out I was right, they were able to walk through the limbs fairly well IF I supplied pressure to the branch to widen the kerf as I cut. The teeth need to be offset from each other to widen the cut as you go. Otherwise, the blade gets really hot, smokes and I would imagine hurts any tempering the blade may have started with. They get the job done, but they could be improved."
4,Does the job... but easily warped,"it may be by design, but these blades are thin. I say they may be thin by design so they can slide through the ""green"" limbs and branches you are cutting with ease. And they do, like a hot knife through butter. With the big teeth and thin blade they make easy work of anything up to 3"" in diameter... haven't tried taking down the big pine in the back, but i'll let you know how that goes.-Only issue stems from what makes these blades great, they are thin. Being thin they are pretty easy to warp and bend while you are chewing through the branches. However, this is very easy to fix with the back claw of a hammer."
3,"Skil ""pruning"" blades...","These blades don't work any better or cut any faster than any reciprocating blades for wood cutting, which is exactly what these are. They are not special pruning blades, as the description suggests. They are much more flexible than my old blade, which I don't consider to be a benefit."
5,Skil - The Ugly,"Hey, how good can something that means work be! Really, these blades do the job trimming trees and cutting landscape timbers. Have been using them for many many years. They are long lasting."
5,Ideal for pruning,I was a bit apprehensive as they were so inexpensive. However I've now almost completed pruning the trees throughout our property. They cut more cleanly than a chain saw yet still get through branches up to four inches thick without undue effort. I'm surprised the blades last so well as I'm still on the first blade after all of this work. If you are thinking about a chainsaw then I'd recommend you consider instead a reciprocating saw with these or similar pruning blades unless you are going for really heavy work. The other great advantage is that the saw is really quiet to operate so it won't unduly annoy your neighbors.
5,Fantastic Blade,These blades are Awesome. Just watch your fingers cause they are real sharp. Great for demo work. I will purchase more.
1,Amazon Rip-off,I ordered what Amazon listed as a 5-set of blades and only received one blade. I told the Amazon rep on the phone and did he offer to make it right? NO he did not. He just said he'd look into changing the ad. Amazon should have made sure I got 5 blades regardless if it waqs a mistaken ad. Just be careful what you order from Amazon... You definitely can get ripped-off!James Hollingsworth
4,Magical stuff,"The author has a wonderful command of old Scots and he brings the past alive with this story . The conflict between the Church and the old Pagan ways of rural Scotland is very much to the fore of the novel .The language and the description are excellent and the momentum carries you along . Some aspects of the Warlocks powers and his ability to use them are not always obvious to the reader, but then it would appear that they are not always obvious to the Warlock either! On a cold winter's evening with a roaring fire and a bottle of single malt , what better way to pass the time."
2,"Wonderful subject, a disappointing read","There's something about the rich, mythical history of Scotland that lures me back to books like this. Perhaps it's a tug towards the ancestral home.The warlock surfaces early and as he grows he learns more about harnessing his mystical powers. Human and spiritual experiences and relationships are interwoven such that at times you're not sure what's what. The descriptions of his encounters with creatures from the woods are vivid and the results are often surprising and unexpected.As the warlock loses direction in his life, so does the book and the last 100 pages seem forced - without the magic of early chapters. Perhaps this is a reflection of an ultimately fruitless life?"
4,What I look for in movies.,"The movie drags excessively in a couple of parts, but most of the pace is appropriate. The confused depictions of reality authentically mirror a child's perspective. The backstory is exposed by degrees, slowly and convincingly, which makes the viewer a participant. A definite recommendation."
1,Bootlegged NTSC TV shot with a blurred lens,I agree with the other reviewers about the awful quality of this DVD. They didn't mention the high noise floor and bathroom resonance of the sound track.
5,Absolute cinematic classic,"For anyone who is looking for this film, this is the definitive DVD version as far as i know. I believe this is the official Spainish DVD. The qulity is excellent, no faults. You do need a multi-regional DVD player if you're in the US or not in Region 2.This film should be better known because it's a classic and a masterpiece. It should be shown in Cinema classes, or at least Spanish cinema. Anyone who enjoyed Ana Torrent in ""Spirit of the Beehive"" will definetely enjoy her in this performance, she does not look much older, but a little. She does more things, feels more emotions and has a much more developed character - IMO. This movie is deep, and shot in a very creative style. The script is perfect. Anyway, this film is incredible. Very highly recommended."
1,available elsewhere as a licensed DVD,"A Region 2/PAL DVD with removable English subtitles, and excellent picture quality, is available from many sellers in Europe under the Spanish title ""Cría Cuervos"". DVDGO is one such seller, find them via your favorite search engine. Don't settle for a terrible quality bootleg."
1,WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT!!,"I had long looked forward to seeing this superb Spanish movie on DVD. ""Cria"" {1976} is a masterpiece in the political movie genre, a telling critique of the baleful effects of Franco's Fascist regime on Spanish society as seen through the eyes of a little girl. Ana Torrent, at only age 9, delivers one of the best performances by a child actor I have ever seen.But who is responsible for this cheap, amaterish DVD production? It is much worse than the 1988 VHS edition, with washed-out and grainy textures and with the subtitles virtually unreadable.It is a disaster. Carlos Saura-the writer-director, Ana Torrent and the other excellent makers and performers of this great movie deserve so much better.Maybe Criterion will sometime give this great movie the care and attention it deserves, like they did recently for the great 1952 French film ""Forbidden Games"".Blaine in Seattle."
1,Another gullible consumer,"I too was duped by this incredibly poor quality, obviously bootlegged copy of Cria! I was excited by the possiblity of a DVD version of this wonderful film, but it certainly was too good to be true, thanks to ""Miracle Pictures"" whoever they are. I really wish I had taken the time to read the reviews before purchasing. I won't make that mistake twice.I am shocked that Amazon should still be selling such an item, with complaints dating back as far as 2004. PLEASE TAKE IT OFF YOUR CATALOGUE. Someone should do something to prevent this trade in such garbage.PS. I had to give this 1 star, but really I give it a big 0."
3,Yet another variation,This time Allan Quatermain (Patrick Swayze) and Elizabeth Maitland (Alison Doody) go after her father Dr. Sam Maitland (John Standing). He is held prisoner by nasty natives and they want his key to King Solomon's mine. They are accompanied by a not so mysterious native Umbopa (Sidede Onyulo). On the way they are encumbered be some bad guys with their own agendas.I will not go into detail but those loyal to the book and/or familiar with the Stewart Granger version may be disappointed. Thos uneducated may enjoy it to the end.Very few videos can match or best a book. And this one does not. Yet it does top most of the others attempts as a variation on the story. Being long enough it could have been the book. But it is someone else's idea of what we want to see. This is well worth watching as its own variation on the story they added a few twists turns and characters. They are probably trying to as an Indiana Jones feel. Alison Doody was in the Indiana Jones movie.
4,Well worth the watch!,"This movie is not like the book, but it is still very interesting. Patrick Swayze does a wonderful job as Allan. The rest of the cast do a good job as well, but Swayze really makes the movie. Beautiful scenery, and it has some funny parts. The movie is kind of long, almost 3 hours. Over all it is a great family movie."
3,Enjoyable,"Enjoy treasure hunting romance films. While not the quality of National Treasure, this film is enjoyable..especially if you like Patrick Swayze."
4,More than pleased,Another movie ordered as a gift. Recipient said it has more to it than the copy indicated and he is tickled pink with it. Way to go!
2,a little disappointed,The DVD was scratched quit badly and skipped a lot through about a 30 minute section. Did manage to get through it so it worked out okay.
1,Worst picture ever??,"This picture should never have been made. At least I should never have bought it! An Indian Jones ""look-a-like"", but without any nerve."
5,Best movie adaptation!,"This movie was an unexpected pleasure and really fun to watch!Swayze does a great job as Quartermaine & Alison Doody is wonderful as the female lead. There are never annoying moments of disgusted ""They'd never do that"", or ridiculous temple-of-doom type comedy lines. The screenplay and plot were terrific, the adventure was compelling, and the entire movie was heartwarming. Villains were even well-wrought. Scenery was breathtaking.Well done, highly recommended, and perfect for family viewing on a Sunday afternoon or early Saturday evening."
3,Adaptation of a film rather than the book,"I read with interest the opinion of some reviewers that this version of King Solomon's Mines varies greatly from the book. It does indeed! However, it is a pretty good remake of the other film attempts to retell the story. The Stewart Granger version of the 1950s was very dramatic, while Richard Chamberlain's later attempt was a purely fun romp. I think that this new version with Patrick Swayze is a fine cross between the two--enough Indiana Jones to induce smiles, and enough drama to keep the characters interesting. It's worth the view."
4,"Flawed, But Worth a View","An entertaining adventure, except for the opening scene with the elephant being shot. As an animal lover I found this scene disturbing. The only minor complaint I have about the movie was with the actress who portrayed Elizabeth. Although a talented actress, I feel that her look was too contemporary for the setting of the movie. Her eyebrows were too thin and her bleached blonde hair too artificial for the time period. In fact in one of the last scenes when she and Patrick Swayze's character were lying on the ground kissing, you can see her obvious very dark grown-out roots. For a Hallmark movie which typically pays extraordinary attention to detail, I'm surprised this obvious point was overlooked. All in all it's a good adventure movie and I recommend it."
2,Emiliano Zapata,"There are over 70 movies on amazon about Zapata. This one is very rustic, difficult to hear and the picture quality is poor. It's always difficult to focus on the movie when there are audio/visual issues."
2,Like a plastic pie tray,"Well this was a disappointment. It does hold my exercise ball, but I can't sit on the ball and use it like a chair on this without it scooting away. It's just a cheap basic piece of plastic. I should have gotten something sturdier. With shipping, I received it and thought, 20 bucks for that?!?!?"
4,goood camera,works better from a tripod. battery length definitely shorter than expected. Very good quality pics but too many blurry pictures from the least movement of the picture taker.
5,Simple to Use Even A Child Could Figure Out How,"I am not a professional photographer and never will be. My life is very active and I needed a camera that is simple to use. If you are looking for a camera that will take beautiful pictures and not have to read the whole manual before to do it, this is the camera for you! The menu is very easy to use and it is a great point and shoot camera if you don't want to mess with changing everything. This camera has been used sometimes daily because I also list on Ebay. The 4.0 megapixels really give it that extra boost in quality pic taking. I also have the Kodak DC3400 and this was an upgrade. Both cameras are great!"
3,"Nice Camera,affordable price...charger problems..","Great camera when it comes to photos or price but the international charger does not work up to expectation. It like a conventional charger does not completely charge the battery, rather it switches off just after 10 minutes or so and you gotta manually start it up again (for another 10 minutes...) . The manual mentions that slowly this 10 min thing will increase....but what the hell!!The transfer software does not work when you have anything less than 90% charged battery... so either carry loads of DuraCells or be patient and do the 10 minute drill....(Though i didn't mind getting the travel case along with the camera at this price !)OVerall Satisfactory"
1,Unhappy with Kodak,"I have a different model Kodak camera, however they all use the same EasyShare software. Running Windows XP, I could not get the software to work properly. After several hours on the phone with Kodak tech support, they couldn't get it working either. They said they are aware of the problem. It is now several weeks later and they still don't have a fix. They don't really seem to care either.It might not be a bad idea to consider other brands, instead of Kodak. Since, if the software won't work properly, then what good is the camera?"
1,Disappointing,"I picked this book up thinking that it would be in the vain of McKillip's other works. What I discovered was a confusing, un-engaging, and overly ""literary"" novel about a psychologically and emotionally disturbed girl with two distinct internal personae. If you're looking for more of the enchanting fantasy/sci-fi writing that I love from McKillip, this book is NOT for you. If you like early 20th century existentialist literature, you'll probably love it."
5,Wonderful!!!!,"This Pavarotti set; The Pavarotti Edition; is a wonderful collection of Arias and songs that cover Luciano's great career. Pavarotti is THE Voice of the 20th Century and this set does him justice. It includes 10 CDs with over 750 minutes of music; Includes Music from All of His roles; has a beautiful 76 page full color booklet; Has a wonderful write up; and includes a bonus CD of Pavarotti's fist album, a 45, from 1964, which has never been released on CD before this set. Every Song is hear, This SET is a must have for every Pavarotti Fan."
3,OK,Shirt fits as advertised and will work out just fine. Must have an undershirt with it as it is very thin. It is also a very light ivory
5,must read,"This is a great book for anyone in the arts, entertainment or communication that struggles with if they should or how they can integrate their faith with their work."
4,Changed Perspective,"""The Rock 'n Roll Rebellion"" changed my perspective on Contemporary Christian Music (CCM). Not all CCM is good quality, yet paradoxically groups that actually strive to influence through excellence often find themselves preaching to the choir because their CDs have been relegated to dusty Christian bookstores. However, as the CD selection currently available at Tower Records in downtown Tokyo demonstrates, ""pop music culture is becoming more...open to songs with strong spiritual messages"". It is time for people of faith with musical talent to take advantage of this trend and be heard by a larger audience because of their quality sound and thought-provoking lyrics. Joseph's book presents a challenge that is well-grounded in research and the personal experiences of those who have grappled with this issue; it is a must-read for all who aren't afraid of a changed perspective."
3,Piggy backing off Charlie peacocks much better work,"The entire premis, thesis of this book is much better and more broadly addressed by Charlie Peacock in his definitive work by the same publishing house, At The Cross Roads. If you can only get one of these books, get Charlie's."
5,EXCELLENT! COULD NOT PUT THE BOOK DOWN!,"I will definitely buy any book written by Patricia Cabot. This sequel to her first book is marvelous. I love Jeremy and Maggie. Childhood sweethearts. It was so romantic. I remember reading in the first book how Maggie was the bane of Jeremy's existence. How he couldn't retaliate against her because she was a ""girl"". Now he is taller than her and stronger. I read this book twice. Oh to have someone like Jeremy. He is so funny. He just wouldn't let Maggie go. The way he assumed she would say yes when he first asked her to marry him and she laughed in his face. I love it. I can't wait until Patricia comes out with another book!!! I hope it's another sequel because I so love seeing Pegeen and Edward again. And Pegeen and Edward are still romantic. Pegeen is pregnant again with her seventh child indicating Edward still cannot keep his hands off her as in the first book. I hope if she writes a sequel we will still see Jeremy and Maggie as well as Edward and Pegeen."
3,Silly fun stuff,"This book is silly fun. That's it really. Two immature people circling each other, both crazy about each other but just couldn't say the three words for no particular reason. It's fun, breezy to read, and there are many laugh-out-loud scenes.If only there is more substance to the fun. *sigh*"
2,PASS ON THIS BOOK,"This book was passable. I thought the two characters were very immature and did not merit their own story. They were playing at being in love and I did not find it entertaining. I have read Cabot's other 2 books and highly recommend those, but save your money and pass on this one."
1,hated it....,"Simply put-the story opens on the ""hero"" letting his Uncle know he's been kicked out of Oxford, for killing another student in a duel. This is after he'd already been kicked out of Eton and Harrow as well. He procedes to blame the Uncle-""because you've made me take the title of Duke"". UGH-what a spoiled jerk.If you like your characters with a bit or moral fortitude then I suggest you skip this-no stars."
2,NOT A KEEPER...,"I really enjoyed Cabot's first book-Where Roses Grow Wild. My enjoyment led me to buying An Improper Proposal and this one. I really did not enjoy this book as much as I did the other two. The characters in this book seemed pretty young and the plot was kind of slow. I liked the idea that the hero was so much in love with the heroine and for such a long period, but I didn't understand why she was such an idiot for playing games and getting engaged to someone else. That pretty much is the plot. I guess this wasn't a terrible book, but it is not one that I am planning to keep or read over. It was already difficult enough to finish this book the first time around."
4,4.5 stars...,"Description from the back of book:Sweet, gentle schoolteacher Natalie Brock's life changed forever when handsome rancher Mack Killian branded her with his masterful kisses and gave her a tantalizing taste of true passion. Ever since that first sensual awakening, Natalie knew Mack was the only man for her. Trouble was, the rough-edged loner had sworn off marriage - especially to an innocent rose like her - and told her so on more than one occasion. But Natalie wasn't giving up. For Mack had taught her the best was worth fighting for ... and Natalie would not settle for anything less than all his love!* This was my first Diana Palmer book & I really enjoyed it. This book will hook you right from the start. It gave me many laughs & a few tears along the way. I did find some of the phrase & expressions to be very repetitive. She used some of the sayings over & over again. That's my only real complaint. I would certainly recommend this book."
5,great new version of an old favorite.,"My old version of this cookback that I'd had for decades finally fell apart. I ordered this one expecting 'the same' but found nice updates in photos, the narrative, some new recipes, etc."
1,Riddled with errors,"I love reading this book but the recipes needed more testing before publication. The nachos sauce calls for a horrendous amount of sugar (an ingredient typo?). GAdo-gado is bland, bland bland. My friends and I marvel that this book has become so popular, because so many of the recipes are so bad."
4,"Easy, Delicious, Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone","As a vegetarian and a fan of healthy cooking, this cookbook is a staple in my kitchen.The recipes are delicious and easy to follow. They include clear, step-by-step instructions that make it almost impossible to fail. I truly appreciate that the recipes don't require a lot of exotic, difficult ingredients. This would be a great gift for a new vegetarian or anyone who appreciates good vegetarian dishes.My only issue with this book is the binding, as it is difficult to lay it flat on the counter while cooking. I would prefer a spiral binding."
1,Vastly Overrated Book,I am amazed that this book has survived so long in print. It must be the food philosophy that Katzen promotes that is the attraction. Recipes aren't at all good. Check out the food-related websites if you think mine is a minority opinion. There are far far better ways to prepare this sort of food.
2,Cheesy,"I've never been a fan of Katzen's cookbooks. The original recipes were drenched in cheese, cream and butter. ""Ethnic"" recipes (except, perhaps, for those drawing on her own heritage) tended to be bland and inauthentic. Although the newer edition promises to correct these faults, I don't find that the food is substantially different. Bleah."
2,Not exactly heart healthy,"This cookbook was recommended by my sister, whom I trust when it comes to healthy eating.I got the cookbook and noticed immediately it has NO nutrional analysis of the recipes.I am a heart patient, focused on reducing my cholesterol and sodium.In order to get nutrional analysis of each recipe, I picked 4 that looked good and entered them into my Master Cookbook program. I was stunned by the amounts of cholesterol and sodium in these recipes.As a result, I will be returning the cookbook. ""Vegetarian"" recipes like these are not necessarily healthy, although many of them are low in calories, this is not the entire health picture."
2,Moosewood cook book,I think it is a vegetarian cook book and I eat meat. Probably won't use too much. May use it as a gift to someone.
5,Lots of wonderful recipes,"So far, we have enjoyed this cookbook. It's rare to find a book with so many recipes that look yummy (and that taste good too). The recipes that we have tried so far have all been good."
3,Mixed results,"I'm not a vegetarian, but I do try to limit the amount of meat I eat, so I was delighted to recieve this cookbook as a gift. I've had limited success with it, though. Generally, I find the recipes to be rather labor-intensive and not good enough to be worth the effort. If you are a strict vegetarian, I think you'd find the effort more worthwhile, since you're limited in the ingredients you can use in your cooking.Favorite recipe: tostadas. Her refried bean recipe is the best I've had.Worst: Apricot-almond bread. It sounded wonderful, but I have a hard time believing she tested this recipe. She says to bake it for 90 minutes. I took it out of the oven after 75 minutes and it was so overbaked that it nearly tasted like charcoal (and it's not because my oven was too hot--I have an oven thermometer). A sad waste of my dried apricots and almonds."
5,One of My Very Favorite Cookbooks,"This is a GREAT cookbook. I love the ""handwritten"" feel of the book itself, the author's commentary, and the delicious, but ""different"" recipes. This book is great inspiration for not only using the recipes as presented, but also adding your own touches to customize what you are given.One reviewer commented that this cookbook would not be great for someone of ""unrefined"" tastes [a meat and potatoes type perhaps]. I have the back them up on that - my husband is a meat and potatoes guy and I haven't made even one single recipe from this book that he would eat. However, for those who are more adventurous, you'll adore the treats in this book!"
2,Didn't live up to the hype,"Perhaps I was not the intended audience for this cookbook. I am a non-vegetarian who wants to start eating less meat but has no plans to go vegetarian. I also love to cook, but lately my job has greatly reduced the amount of time I have to partake in that.I've made a few recipes from the book so far. I have found them to take a considerable amount of time to prepare and cook, and the finished products weren't as tasty as I would have liked."
4,Great resource,"I love this book - the one I have is the re-print of the book that has the original handwritten recipes and doodles surrounding the pages. Classic, good tasting food that is easy to make."
5,A classic that I use 25 years later,"I have the original 1977 hardback edition of the Moosewood Cookbook. The binding is falling apart, the cover is stained with decades of past ingredients, and the book now opens 'automatically' to the most-used recipes. The ratatouille is perhaps the most-used recipe, and it never fails to win praise from guests. I also have come to rely on the book for basic recipes such as pesto. The stews and soups are always hearty. Although part of the magic of this cookbook, as a book, was the hand-printed recipes with the artistic flourishes around the recipe titles, I nevertheless find myself wishing that this and other Katzen books would be put out in Kindle editions. I already use my iPad quite a bit for recipes, it would be a great convenience to add the Moosewood Cookbook to the other sources."
5,taking vegetables to new places,"Mollie's book is a terrific source for cooks who want to turn up the volume on their vegetable recipes. The book is chock full of great ideas for new twists on old vegetables. Mollie is an artist by background, and her plates really show her artistic and culinary talents. Consider that she uses vegetables to make purees and then uses the purees for painting the plate. Her creativity and use of a wide variety of vegetables make the book all the more appealing to cooks who may be stuck for what to pair with their proteins.I have met Mollie and heard her speak: she is an energetic, engaging person who makes you want to come along for the ride with her to Moosewood.Her ideas will get even the most seriously vegetable-challenged turn into vegetable-enthusiasts!"
5,Yum,"This book made my decision to become a vegetarian easy. I was a little hesitant at first to eat some of the food in here when I saw it prepared, but that only lasted until my first bite. I now love vegeatables! This is by far my favorite cookbook. The recipes are easy to prepare and are delicious. Yum."
3,Expectations,"The recipes are great and the steps easy to follow. Slightly disappointed though as I had seen and tasted food the original book's recipes and was so impressed I purchased this one. only I didn't expect so many changes to recipes etc. So now I am borrowing my friends book so that I can make notes of the original recipes alongside the newer versions of the same dish, as I did prefer the older version. Subtle changes to spices, ingredients but makes a difference. Overall though a good book and a great intro to vegetarian cooking!"
3,Not the original version,"I was looking to replace my original copy that I got in the early 80's in Australia. Somewhere along the way I lost it. This one I thought looks like the original but is not. I was looking for a an apple pancake recipe and of course, its not in this one. Otherwise, its OK."
1,Not the wonderful old version - everything is changed for the worst.,"I loved the original Moosewood cookbook. I had borrowed it from a friend and cooked with it often. When I bought the new version, I was quite surprised at the changes in the recipes. The recipes had lowered the fat and upped the sugar content. That's good you might say - well I didn't know too many fat vegetarians in the 70's. Good fats from eggs butter and cream - satisfy your hunger plus give you good nutrition. Sorry to say these revised recipes are just not as good as the old ones. I am very disappointed in this version. Plus the new photos take out the charm of the book.I do recommend buying the original version used if you can find it."
3,"Leaner cuisine than the original, but not as tasty . . .","This cookbook might be a good introduction to vegetarian cooking, but I prefer the ""old"" version of this cookbook, although that one was a bit heavy on more fattening ingredients (cheeses, for example). The ""Moosewood Restaurant Cooks at Home"" might be a better choice for someone who doesn't already have a Moosewood Cookbook, or who is looking for a beginner vegetarian cookbook. Still, it's worth having on your cookbook shelf if you don't have the original version, and already have started your veg cookbook collection with other cookbooks."
2,Never Again,"First off, I've never ever review any of my purchases on Amazon until this one, that's how mad I am. This device came without the keys for the drawer. Contacted customer support person at the company several times about it, and received nothing back from them. NOTHING! I would never buy anything from this company. In fact, I will use it, and then return it just because I'm mad about how this company handles their customers. Poor customer service and poor assembly. If you buy this, you're on your own."
3,Not so great for one reason.,"The book in itself was great. My son loved it, but the battery didn't even last a week and a replacement battery is too expensive. I recommend this book for people who can afford to replace the battery every week. The pictures and music were great and we had fun until it crashed."
1,Nonsense,"From claiming that no Queen of England had a drop of English blood and failing to identify Mathilda (Edith) of Scotland as the daughter of Margaret of England, grand-daughter of Edmund II Ironside to saying that Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick and Kingmaker was his father's younger son and married twice proves a lack of research that is damning and makes this book absolutely worthless."
1,Read with caution!,"While I applaud the idea of this book, the research behind it is terribly faulty. Aside from the mistakes already mentioned, she claims that Isabelle of Angouleme, John's queen, was betrothed to an incorrect individual and blames her for the loss of John's French lands, which has not been believed for at least a century. Read with caution, and double check any information!"
4,A look into the personal lives of the English Monarchs,This book tells the story of all the women to marry onto the English throne. Where the came from. How the came to be Queen Concorts of England. And how there lives influenced England.
4,The SACD version is better,"Despite what ""Musicman"" says in his review, it is definitely worth it for all music lovers get the SACD version of this disc....Not only do you get more music, but the sound of ALL of the music is considerably improved, even if you haven't gotten around to acquiring a SACD-capable CD player yet. For now, this SACD version plays wonderfully on all machines, and when you eventually get around to buying one which can reproduce the full potential of SACD recordings, you won't have to worry about buying yet another version of this recording, because you've already got it right here.As a general rule, buy hybrid SACD recordings when they're available, and then you can be confident you've got the ""best"" for the foreseeable future. Don't get suckered into having to upgrade again later!"
5,Love this!,"Great Queen poster! I like it even better in person than in the picture. It's great because you can see the cover of all the Queen singles. And, of course, I love the middle photo of Freddie Mercury.The poster is ideal for doors, but works great on the wall too (I first put on the wall, then decided on the door). Also, it's not a thin or flimsy poster, so you won't have to get it laminated and it will not get damaged easily the way other posters do.Anyway, I really recommend this! If you like the picture, you'll like the poster. Wonderful product for Queen fans!"
5,Will there ever be a new edition of this title?,Will there ever be a new edition of this title? It's been ten years. Any info. would be much appreciated.
5,THIS BOOK HAS ALL THE INFO ON ALL DISNEY ANIMATED CHARACHTER,"IF YOUR A DISNEY FAN, YOU HAVE TO HAVE THIS BOOK. PACKED WITH EVERYTHING YOU WANT TO KNOW ABOUT DISNEY'S ANIMATED CHARACHTERS."
4,really liked it,"This has almost everything you need to pass a trig class. Its cheap, and its a great study guide to keep by your desk. Couple it with a TI-89 calculator and you have a win win combination."
2,Won't be used,These are laminated in hopes of keeping the precious info preserved. And it is jam packed with info BUT.... you won't use them. You'll rely on your notes and the text. Its a great idea but not useful enough to warrant purchasing. Even for studying it is a waste because tests are specific to subjects and this is just a fly over of ALL Trig.
4,Bodysong,I like soundtrack music. It has ups and downs. If you like Tangerine Dream you'll like Bodysong. Amazon has it listed as Collin Greenwoods album and it is his brother Johnny that put it together.
3,Sloppily intricate experimental movie soundtrack,"3 1/2Compellingly produced score for this relatively obscure birth/death doc of sorts will have little trouble finding its way into intense Radiohead fans catalogues, not only because Jonny Greenwood is basically the unsung songwriting hero of the band who here is able to let loose and create a kind of unhinged Kid A, but also because we are witness to some of his convincingly arranged classical and jazz flirtations."
4,highly recommended,"Johnny Greenwood's soundtrack to Bodysong is terrific. It should be said, however, that if you are buying it expecting Radiohead songs (as others on this site have said), you're barking up the wrong tree. Songs contain singing by definition. I hear now from listening to this record how much a large portion of Kid A/Amnesiac was Johnny Greenwood's creation. I can hear elements of RH's ""Pyramid Song"", ""National Anthem"", ""Dollars and Cents"", ""Hunting Bears"", and ""Trans-Atlantic Drawl"" specifically. There is a haunting and eerie beauty to this record and I've listened to it exclusively on repeat since I've bought it. Perhaps seeing the film along with it would make the music more enjoyable, but it stands up on its own quite well. This is noisy, mysterious, sad, hypnotic, and challenging music. Being a lover of experimentation i embrace it and I believe any true fan of Radiohead's sonic experiments will appreciate it immediately."
4,Some great music!,"I bought this disc so I could have the track ""Convergence"" after hearing it used so effectively in ""There Will Be Blood."" I was quite surprised at the whole disc; it will be very enjoyable to anyone who has an appreciate for instrumental music."
3,It's O.K.,"It's O.K. It does the job and easy to mount. Hoewever, it's a bit flimsy and not worth the heavy shipping fee."
3,Ok but not great.... fun album though,"(Edit: I reviewed this before listening to the bonus CD but amazon wont let me raise the stars, but I give it a 4/5)Like the sticker on the cover said, this is music for fans of bands like dragonforce or 3 inches of blood, that don't take themselves seriously. With that in mind it's a reasonably good album, in true power metal fashion. The lyrics are corny, they sing about how metal they are in most of the songs. But the guitar work and singing is pretty good. My favorite songs are Fire! Battle! In Metal!; Let me out; Kingdom at War, and Higher on Fire. If you see it for cheap pick it up, but don't expect to be blown away."
1,Misleading advertising by Amazon,"I purchased this book because of my interest in the the commodity business. I expected a current history of Cargill, not an ancient history. Everything has changed in the commodity markets in the last decade and I was very disappointed that Amazon would (I believe falsely) aggressively promote this book at a $25 price. I will be more careful in my future purchases. I realize that I could have returned it, but could not be bothered. It did glance through the book and did learn a few things I did not know about Cargill, such as its dominance in malted barley."
3,Hard to Understand,"This documentary looks like it would be really cool, and I am sure it is. But the narrator's voice is overpowered by the background music. Although I am not fluent in Spanish, I have taken many university classes taught only in Spanish and can easily follow spoken (textbook) Spanish. But, as I just said, the background music overpowers the narrator's voice. And on top of that, the narrator has a deep voice, which itself is hard to understand. But if you are fluent in Spanish and can understand many types/accents of Spanish then you will probably do fine. Every now and then I put the DVD in, turn up the volume, and hope that I can finally hear what the narrator is saying."
3,Frye Gwen,"Very comfy, color lighter than expected, little too 70s looking and busy with bow and folds."
5,"Great book about your IT career, not just the outsourcing threat","I think this book suffers from a poorly chosen title. It makes it seem much more of a niche book than it is.""Take Charge of Your Career"" would have been a better title. This book is for those of us who really want to be in this sector and are looking for what the right moves are. It is too easy to end up working in an IT job that you floated into rather than worked towards or deliberately chose.The last line of the book says it best:""Satisfaction, like our career choices, is something that should be sought after and *decided* upon *with intention*."
4,Helpful and very timely book,I am glad to run into this book. I like its comprehensible and friendly tone. It is like a wand. I believe it helped me greatly to reconsider many things I have been thinking about and reevaluate my priorities. I would frankly recommend the book to read thru and get back to its chapters on regular basis.
2,generic repetitive advice,I regret the time spent reading this book.Only somebody with a very high opinion of himself could try to share such commonplace and generic ideas.You would do better by spending your time reading on of the following books which actually provide concrete advice on becoming better at our craft:-The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master by Andrew Hunt and David Thomas-Code Complete: A Practical Handbook of Software Construction by Steve McConnell-Practices of an Agile Developer: Working in the Real World by Venkat Subramaniam and Andy Hunt
5,A vital survey of how an employed computer person's active job can vanish overseas tomorrow,"Any working in the computer industry knows outsourcing overseas is a big trend - and My Job Went To India (And All I Got Was This Lousy Book): 52 Ways To Save Your Job is a vital survey of how an employed computer person's active job can vanish overseas tomorrow. The company changes, technology changes, economy changes - and ways a computer professional can add value to his job has also changed. If you haven't adapted - My Job Went To India is for you: it's about making choices in skills levels which add value to a job which can't easily be duplicated for less, overseas - and it talks about both skills and marketing services. A top-rated pick, My Job Went To India is recommended beyond the computer industry for any observing the outsourcing trend in corporate American businesses."
2,"Unimpressive, general career advice.","This book has a bunch of generic advice along the lines of keep up with things and don't put all your eggs in one basket. Not exactly a revelation here.If you read the relevant blogs, web sites and talk to people in the industry you don't need this book."
3,"Vigorous, But Far Away","For me this Bruggen disc of Haydn symphonies is very frustrating. While the performances, as noted above, are quite vigorous and fresh, the exceptionally quiet live recording makes me feel like I'm listening from the nosebleed seats. Whatever advantage is gained by using original instruments is mostly lost on my ears, even on headphones, in the resonant distance. It's no exaggeration to say I have mono recordings from the 50's with more presence and immediacy than these 80's digital productions."
4,fullmetal alchemist,"this dvd includes episode 20-24, you can also watch fullmetal alchemist on adult swim monday-wednesday at 12:30 am. and new episode on saturday at 12.00am. this dvd is awsome!"
3,"Danish, German or Chinese?","Mine are made in Denmark, increments ENGRAVED into the triangle, cm on the long edge.All I can find now is made in China, increments printed, inferior quality, 1:80,000 scale on long edge.What a shame, I would happily pay double for another Danish pair."
3,"Duplicate of another drama, Mary Stayed Out All Night","This series is very good, but the subtitles get weird and more Chinese than Korean in the translation to English. The names suddenly which were Korean become Chinese. This happens at the most crucial part in the story and stays that way for the last 3rd of the series. Big bummer. Also, I bought both series thinking they were different. Now I am out the money. Very disappointed in this. Buyer beward. I don't know how to check in the future, but between a contact at Ya Entertainment, and a good contact at RollingDonut2, maybe I will get help in future purchases.Marry Me Mary and Mary Stayed Out All Night - same drama - two titles, two different boxes."
3,Good look at the history of sci-fi,I find reading older stories so interesting - seeing how a great like Wells thought the future of exploration would turn out is so fun.
4,Good sci-fi reading,"If you like science fiction you should download this copy of ""The First Men in the Moon"". While knowing what we know now about the moon makes parts of the story seem preposterous, I found it easy to suspend my disbelief for this story. Considering this was written before we could see the surface of the moon, I found it very inventive. The moon plants and other things they find are explained with reasoning and it is entertaining to follow. The main characters are entertaining, and the narrator character isn't the easiest character to like, but it is supposed to be this way. He's trying to tell the story so it puts him in the best light but I thought it made the story more entertaining. Overall a classic sci-fi story, if you call yourself a sci-fi fan you need to read H.G. Wells' ""The First Men in the Moon""."
5,One of my favorites.,I love HG Wells. He is one of my favorite classic science fiction writers. Good book as are all of his!
1,Great story...terrible edition,The edition published was full of typos and did no justice to a great H.G.Wells story.I'd like my money back so I can buy from a competent publisher.
1,Culturally Sensitive Masterpiece,"The pairing of European orchestral music, especially the climactic superimposition of the choral singers on the tourist images of Cambodia, creates a stunning impression that the director is making a heavy-handed political statement or is out-of-touch and does not look at the world other than via cliches."
1,"Warning, Regional code!",Did not realize this film came from the US with RegionI coding. Not possible to play on any exquipment in Europe.To me a total waste. Have not found an european version yet.
1,50 minutes !!!! what a rip,All i can say is too short for a woman that has been recording for soo long
4,A MOVING STORY,"This film was very touching and moving to me as it followed the life experiences of a young boy who left the only place he called home to be introduced to a world unknown on the other side of the planet. Many of us have been through experiences such as these at one point in time in our lives. I loved how the producers were able to make you place yourself in Hector's shoes, the star of the movie and feel many of the frustrations he learned to overcome.To me, Santa Mesa was about making the best of what you have in life and where you are in life to grasp who you really are in this great, big world."
5,very informative,"This book is filled with pre-conception to postpartum chapters. There are a ton of pictures, but a few are dark. There are a lot of drawings and charts. The authors organized this book very well and included a lot of critical thinking problems and the chapter summaries are some of the best I've read. (Usually the chapter summaries in my textbooks are pretty vague.) I love this book, and learned a lot from it. It's very helpful, even for non-nurse mothers who want to read about their pregnancies and deliveries from a more professional standpoint. (Labor drugs are explained in great detail.) Great book!"
3,Good Movie - but the books better,"When i watched this movie... i wondered how anyone that hadn't read the book managed to follow... i felt like there were BIG GAPS in the story... however, my husband... who was watching with me... said he understood it just fine...while the movie didn't have the flair of the book... the actresses did a fine job... i was especially impressed with natalie portman's portrayal of novalee nation... she nailed the role...watch the movie...but read the book too (it's bettER!)"
4,Gump to crap... crap to Gump,"Natalie POrtman and Ashley Judd. both great. this movie reminded me of Forrest Gump... with the way it was told, the surreal nature of the movie, and the lovable and interesting characters. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll down right drool. This movie is fantastic... the characters everything was just great. but the main problem with the movie is the directing.... it's really bad.... the director does horrible editing from one scene to another. he nearly literally puts in a pointless scene with something dramatic and so on.... the director really sucks and nearly ruined the whole movie for me because it started off good and then half way it went back and forth from crap to gump, from gump to crap.....but it's still worth the watch, and possibly worth the purchase."
3,Where the Heart Is. . . Themes and ratings,"I believe that PG-13 is an appropriate rating for the movie ""Where the Heart Is."" There were situations, adult language, and sexual overtones which would or might be inappropriate for younger kids, yet rated R would be too strong a rating since the ""F"" word was not used. I also feel that 13-17 year olds would be interested in the themes and content of the film. That age group would also not be offended by the occasional use of profane language.Parents of pre-teens may not want or think their children are ready for seeing a teen pregnancy and think their kids don*t need to see this to look up to her in any way. There are also abuse situations which came about to Novelee*s friend Lexi and two of her children which may also be inappropriate for those under 13.Over all the movie seemed very real to life, but it*s not something I*d willingly go to see."
4,Where The Heart Is,"Natalie Portman and Ashley Judd shine in Where The Heart Is, a heartwarming story about finding your place in the world. Portman plays Novalee Nation, a soon-to-be mother that is forced to fend for herself when she is abandoned at an Oklahoma Wal-Mart by her deadbeat boyfriend Willy Jack, who flees the scene and is later arrested. Back at the Wal-Mart, Novalee gives birth with the help of Forney, the local librarian, who breaks through the pane glass at Wal-Mart to deliver the child. You then watch as Novalee and her daughter Americus grow and the budding love developing between Forney and Novalee. Tragedies occur when Americus is kidnapped, and again when Novalee's surrogate mother, 'Sister' Husband is killed in a tornado. Learn that home is where you make it, as Novalee ends up where she least expects, but seemingly where she was meant to be all along."
5,Where the Heart Is (DVD),"Order was recieved within a few days (4) I was shocked and happy. Although, this DVD was used, it is in perfect condition. Thanks for the excellent service!!"
3,Where the heart is,"The DVD cover says that there's a spanish subtitle and the true is that there is no spanish subtitle. In the overall, the product had good quality."
3,Where the heart is,Now we know the rest of the story. The book is somewhat didifferent than the movie.
2,Predictability almost saved by strong acting.,"Ah, I love the smell of white trash in the morning...smells like Hollywood contrivance.""Where the Heart Is"" seems to be ambivalent: it's either a commercial for Walmart, or a poster film for the sterilization of uneducated southern women.The film's few strong moments are overshadowed by a plethora of disasters both natural and script-related. (I exaggerate not when I say that I predicted the line ""There's nothing better than you Novalee"" verbatim, a good half hour before the film's conclusion.)The only shining moments come from the lead roles Portman and Judd, both of whom don't receive the roles their talents deserve."
5,I Love this Movie!!!,"This is a nice story with a lot of angles.I was watching tv late one night and saw Sally Field as Iwas flipping through the channels. Her range playing mothers is incredible. In the early 80s, she played the rugged individualist widow in the very excellent ""Places in the Heart."" She also played the assertive and supportive mother in ""Forrest Guamp."" In this movie, she showed she has a spectrum of roles. It was a nice contrast.There isa sort of Cinderella aspect to this movie also that puts it in the same class as ""Fried Green Tomatoes."""
4,Really good movie,"This film had it all, humor, sadness, romance, joy, friendships, southern accents, etc. Since everyone did a good job describing the film, I'll just offer my opinions.It was a surprise, and I really liked it. Natalie Portman, Ashley Judd and Stockard Channing, all gave wonderful performances,and this is a quiet, down home flick that should be enjoyed slowly. No rushing through. :)"
4,"Pack your stuff, head for Oklahoma!","This gem of a movie was almost overlooked until I went searching for James Frain films. Makes you want to pack your stuff, head off to this community in Oklahoma and get a job at Wal Mart! Delightful, heart touching portrayals by Natalie, Ashley, and Stockard. Besides being struck by James Frain's loss of British accent, I was transfixed by his performance. Quite a wonderful fresh actor. Can't give it ""5"" stars, you'll see why in the movie, it deserves much more."
1,Butchered Lesbian Flick,"This movie is just awful. Rather than acting out dramatic scenes, the directors insert tacky cartoons. Repetitive and a waste of time. Glad it was free."
1,The Book Is Better... By A Longshot,"It's not that I didn't enjoy this film, but after finishing the book, I'd have to say that people who've seen the movie and haven't read the book have lucked out. I've never read such a heart-warming story that really makes you think about life and how much there is to appreciate. But, after I read the book I was curious as to how the movie measured up, and I'm sorry to say that the movie didn't. The book has so much more going for it and really explains what goes on, not to mention, things that seem almost and completely different from the movie. For an example, in the book there's a tragedy involving the local library, and the movie, well, nothing remotely compared to that happened. The movie ended differently than I had expected, because there were key points left out that were in the book and not in the movie.So please, read the book! You will not be disappointed. It's wonderful."
1,WHERE THE HEART IS,I DO NOT LIKE THE MESSAGE THIS SEND TO THE PUBLIC. IT THROWS THE IDEA THAT BED HOPING IS OKEY AND MAKES IT ACT LIKE FATHER'S DO NOT MATTER. THE ONE STAR IS THERE ONLY BECAUSE THAT IS THE LOWEST ONE TO CHOICE FROM
5,A Must-See!,"""Where the Heart Is"" is not only heart-warming, but adds humor to the mix as well. Natalie Portman does an excellent job portraying a pregnant and confused teen named Novalee Nation over a span of 5+ years. You'll cry for her and laugh with her. As an added bonus, Ashley Judd plays an eccentric friend of Novalee's. Ashley Judd provides the funniest moments of the movie. This movie is the kind of movie that brings a warmness to the heart. I recommend it to everyone I know and I would definately recommend it to everyone who reads this review."
4,Where the Heart is,"I have watched part of it, but I have not had the chance to watch it completely. However, what I have watched of it, I have enjoyed it."
5,Down home country,It was a change to get use to becuase I have seen the movie pleanty of times before reading the book but I really enjoyed this book.
5,One for the library!,"This is a family favorite that we've had in our dvd collection for years. Our daughter married a year and a half ago & moved 3 hrs. away. She recently mentioned that she had not seen it in a while, & wanted to have ""Where the Heart Is"" for her movie collection... so we bought her one for Christmas!"
4,Walmart baby momma,I love movies that unexpectedly reveal incredible character and ability to love and survive.Everyone has gold in them yet there are some destined to find it because their hearts are gold as well.I like it when people are able to pull themselves up by their bootstraps and don't try to use others in their effort to survive but are willing to accept it when they need it and are willing to do their part to make their dreams come true.I also like it when other people are givers just out of human love and haven't lost faith in others.Keep a box of Kleenex nearby.
5,the best movie for a long time!!,"this movie is the best movie! it teaches tremendous life lessons for young girls to learn such as waiting untill you are married to have a baby, to not go for just any man but to pick the right one for you, and perserverance. this is a great movie that i think many teenagers would love. Natilie Portman and Ashley Judd are the best!!"
5,"Home is truly ""Where the Heart Is""","""Where the Heart Is"" is definately a sensational movie that I recommend very highly. Natalie Portman does an outstanding performance and is truly one of the most sophisticated young actresses that I have ever seen. She is definately wise beyond her years. Ashley Judd also does a wonderful job in this drama as Americus' (Natalie) best friend. They are there for each other every step of the way. I have to say, they have one of the closest relationships in a movie that I have ever seen! Even though Natalie plays a young mother in this movie she definately makes her character sophisticated. She knows how to handle herself and her family, and will do anything for them. I support this movie all the way! I hope each and every one of the people that buys this movie enjoys it as much as I did! Heck, I've seen it twice at the theatre and I'm most definately going to order it!"
2,Made-for-tv film?,"I was surprised that so many high-caliber actresses (Portman, Channing, Field, Judd) would appear in such a mediocre, amateurish production. This film dragged on with its predictable made-for-tv-movie plot and editing. I am truly mystified that it received so many 4-star ratings here."
4,Great movie,This was a great movie to curl up in bed on a cold night and watch and relax..I'd seen it before yrs ago on tv but enjoyed it more by watching it like this on Amazon..just got so much more out of it being able to pause or rewind at my convenience..sure i will come back to Amazon time n time again for for movies.
4,Very Sweet Movie,"I had read some negative reviews on this movie but I decided to give it a chance anyhow and I'm glad I did. Natalie Portman makes any movie great and Ashley Judd as well. At times it does seem like a Lifetime movie but that's where Portman's performance makes you forget that. All in all, it's a really sweet movie worth watching. Oh, by the way, it's a chick flick!"
5,Great Movie!,"This movie really is inspiring, love how sweet and hardworking the mother was. Anything is possible with a loving mother."
4,Good whole hearted movie,This movie made me laugh and cry when I saw it in the movies. Natalie Portman is a terrific young actress. Even though the whole plot isn't to probable the movie was a great movie...I had to buy it after seeing it in the movie theater.
4,Sweet story,"I really liked this movie. I wasn't a Natalie Portman fan before, but I am now. She was wonderful in the role of southern girl Novalee Nation. ""Where The Heart Is"" reminded me of ""Forrest Gump"" because it tells the story of a person's life journey, the interesting people they meet, and how good fortune can come to good people. Of course, this movie only shows us 5 years of Novalee's life, but it's still a treat. I only had two complaints. One, the movie seemed very long. Two, the storyline involving the boyfriend (the movie would cut back and forth between the two storylines) was yawn-worthy at best and seemed kind of pointless . . . until the end of the movie, when everything came together. This movie has a GREAT soundtrack, though, if you love country music, you might be interested. Also, it's an OK movie for older kids (10+). Watch it with your family!"
4,An nice film about growing up and life.,"The plot:An young pregant teenager(Well played by Natalie Portman) is left behind by her bum boyfriend(Kevin Dillon) in the shopping mall-Wal Mart. Then she decide to hide in wal-wart at nights, because she`s a poor young woman and her mother(Uncredited Sally Field) left her alone. Then she had her baby in that wal-mart and she become famous for her 15 minutes of fame for it. Then she becomes friends with her aunt(Stockard Channing) and an new friend Lexie Coon(Ashley Judd). Over the years, Navolee(Portman) is learning about life, taking care of her daughter and being love by another, she meets.DVD`s picture quality is impressive with the anamorphic Widescreen(1.85:1) format and the sound quality is fine for Dolby Digital 5.1 Sorround Sound. Grade:B+."
5,Great Movie,I was not planning to watch the entire movie tonight but when you cannot stop. I loved it !Natalie Portman performance was awesome.It's a must watch.
5,See it,"If you don't think you like the type of movie you think this is see it anyway. I expected this movie to be a waste of time with a bit of eye candy thrown in but I was captivated from start to finish and even watched it a second time the same day. Sorry this is not one of those reviews where they tell you everything that happens in a movie you're about to see - you deserve all the pleasant surprises. See this film, preferably with someone you'd like to see smile."
3,Religious based detective,"I got this book because my daughter is a designer and I thought it would be fun reading. Unfortunately, I hadn't read anything about the book or author, so I wasn't prepared for the story to be more about the character finding her faith again than solving the crime. It just wasn't what I was looking for."
2,Not as good as hoped.,"I don't like to read reviews too much on books because sometimes it gives too much away. So I didn't read any on this book, I just thought I'd try it since the kindle version was free. Well, there truly was too much talk of religion...not exactly something you'd think of reading about in a murder mystery. The actual mystery part itself wasn't so bad. The main character was well written. And no, you definitely don't suspect who the actual killer is until the end. But I still wasn't thrilled with the end. It didn't really go into much explanation oh how the murder actually took place and that was disappointing. I only kept reading it to find out who did it."
3,A good story,"This was a good story, readable, and an interesting plot. I don't agree with the other reviewers about too much religion, I thought it was not at all too much -and gave the story depth. I had a little trouble with believability of characters and scenarios, at times. Sometimes I thought, ""that doesn't match that person's personality..."" but maybe I am too picky. Definitely worth reading, a good book to enjoy."
5,Loved the fact I didn't have it all figured out...,"This book was an enjoyable read! I thoroughly enjoyed the characters, the elegantly woven plot and the fact that I didn't have it all figured out within the first couple of chapters! What fun is it to read a book when you already know the ending?!? Definitely time well spent!"
4,Pretty Good....,"I liked this book and would definitely read more by this author in the future. The ""but"" is that in the case of this book in particular (haven't read anything else by author so far) the main character is not a totally believable/likeable/relatable person. In addition, the ""antagonist"" seems to have been thrown in there simply because one was needed and the whole relationship between the two makes no sense whatsoever. But, again, I would definitely give her another try. On the whole, I would say the book was....... Pretty Good."
3,An Ok Read,"Haley is ready to do a big design job, but murder is in her way. Her mentor Marge is murdered and all fingers point to Haley. This has a lot of religion in it, but not in a terrible pushy way. Haley must find out who the real murderer is and clear her name. But along the way she has to face a lot of pain from her past."
1,Not enough story line,Too much religion seemed to be used as a filler story should be able to stand on its own had potential
3,Good but could be awesome,"Great plot and characters but in desperate need of a good editor. At times it seems the author is trying to hard to be witty and she goes overboard with the metaphors and verbose adjectives. She also seems to think mentioning Starbucks on every other page makes the story more culturally relevant but it just gets annoying. Still, even though I had to push through the muddle at times, I enjoyed the story and its interesting twists."
4,Great book,"Easy to read, cute story, fun characters in the book. Would encourage others to read this book. Enjoyed the book"
4,enjoyed,This is a light read with enjoyable characters and a nice message. I enjoyed how the main character uses martial arts to deal with her frustrations.
5,Encouraging and mysterious,"This series of books is well written and keeps your attention. You feel for the characters, even the bad ones. It also makes you review your actions and thoughts."
2,"Fluffy, but informative...","While I didn't see the ending coming -- always a good thing -- I was not impressed with this book. There were so many implausible moments and leaps of faith (pun nut intended) as a reader that I literally couldn't wait for it to end. This book seemed more as a vehicle for the author to let us know what she knows about martial arts and decorating rather than her ability to create a story or develop characters. I also got the feeling that she was coming to her page allotment and had to end the story as fast as possible. It's a shame. The premise was good... maybe it just needs some balance. Still, I wasn't drawn to Haley -- she's rather unlikable as written -- so I won't go looking for the next installment. Just doesn't do it for me."
3,The price is right,"This is a light read, somewhat entertaining, but way too religious for my taste. The protagonist also spends SOOOO much time in self-pity and downward spiraling that it becomes a little annoying. It was OK for a free book. I wouldn't pay for future releases though."
1,Poorly written,"I picked this book up because I was interested in design. However I couldn't finish it. It was predictable and pedestrian. As to the faith part, Father Brown mysteries are so much better - literate, profound and thrilling."
2,Religion everywhere!,"Nice try at writing a thriller which is why I give the book two stars. Even though the plot could be better, it's still interesting to find out who did it. What annoyed me a lot though is the religion that is thrown in, sometimes page after page. It doesn't start right away, so if you want to finish the book you have to stick with the religious aspects of it. Had I known this I wouldn't have downloaded the book. Why don't you mention it in the general description so people can make an informed choice?"
1,Repetitive -- Vehicle for Christian Message,"The dialogue is repetitive and predictable. Books seems to be a vehicle for Christian message, in a more heavy handed way than the better entries in this genre."
5,good!,"Better than I thought it would be...you never know what your getting with free kindle books. Typical chic murder mystery. Good writing, development of story, etc. Enjoyable read! I see the point of free kindle books....and with this one it had me looking up the rest of the series. THANKS!"
4,"Design on a Crime (Deadly Décor Mysteries, Book 1)","Really enjoyed this mystery, it moved right along with no catches, no foul language or romance novel romances. Look forward to reading Book 2."
4,Design on a Crime,Good quick read. Just a fun book. Great to read if you are traveling you can finish in a short time
3,"Sounds a little airy and cheap, but great for a toddler.","Bought this for 2 year old to introduce him to musical instruments. He already bashed it on the floor and it hasn't broken so that's a plus. It's the same size I remember from 5th grade music class, but maybe not the same tonal quality. A little airy and doesn't hit the pitches perfectly. Then again, I might just be a sub par recorder player. It's a fine beginning instrument for my kid, though."
2,It's okay for toy but it's off tune,It's okay for my kids as a toy but it's off tune.You can't really expect to play music with this.
4,Good for music lessons,My son is taking lessons on ocarina and recorder. His favorite color is green so we ordered him this recorder as a birthday present. He is pleased with the more consistent tone than his original recorder.
2,YOU DO NOT GET 3!,"I was sadly mistakes when I only received one recorder in the mail. The way it is advertised makes you think that you get three, not true! and you can't choose your color. Other than that, it's a decent recorder."
5,Great musical instrument for beginners,"I bought the recorder for my grandson's 10th birthday. He'd just finished a very brief exposure to the instrument and reading music in his 4th grade class and really enjoyed it. He was thrilled with the gift and has spent many hours teaching himself new songs to play on it! I could not be happier with the quality of this item, especially for the price!"
5,Used for Thrush,"I took this product along with others to help combat a case of thrush. I can't say for sure that this was what did the trick, but it definitely didn't hurt anything. So, if you are dealing with the same, order this and take it three times a day!"
4,Grapefruit Seed Extract Capsules,"I bought these for my daughter to take daily, since she works with children and always seem to have a cold. These really seem to help, wouldn't want to stop taking them to find out, but until November went through the school year without so much as the sniffles."
2,Pass on this one,"This is one of those psuedo-religious books that trys to take self-help, weak-mindedness and God's will and then throw it all together in a brew.I give it to the author that he is very straight forward and actually goes deep into the problems that plague men. But I didn't find it interesting and I wouldn't recommend it unless I had a really weak-minded friend."
1,HDMI and/or DVI A/B Switch with Audio,"Junk! The Switch did not work with my two HDMI inputs (Samsung Blu-Ray Player and Comcast HD DVR Cable Box). Only one of the inputs would feed through the box. And then on top of that, neither Amazon nor Presentation Concepts Corporation replied to my e-mails about a return. So, I basically threw away the $54.95. This experience left a bad taste in my mouth with both companies. I will never deal with Presentation Concepts Corporation again; piss poor customer service. I will deal with Amazon again because this is the only bad transaction I have had so far. I will give them the benefit of the doubt."
4,Works pretty well,Just make sure you push the button in all the way and do it fast or you'll leak signal from one hdmi transmitting device to another.
1,"Product Great, Seller Horrible","Received product in damaged condition. Seller has failed to respond to claim, even after documentation sent andclaims filed with UPS, seller and Amazon. Would not recommend seller, especially if you have problems."
4,Dittoheads & nabobs of negativism both will appreciate this!,"I'm a hardcore conservative, my wife a reluctant liberal (she's still hanging on for dear life, though, bless her heart), and we both loved this book. It shows the character of the people who consider patriotism and freedom important enough to back up w/ real sacrifices. I wish this were required reading for everyone."
3,Great for the price.,Glasses are great for the price but you're definitely getting what you pay for. Biggest complaint is they fog up very easily and you can't see well at all until they're cleared.
5,Nice,"This product was comfy, works well, doesn't look super dorky, and enhances color effectively without blinding you. And for the price, you can't beat it."
4,Light duty safety glasses,"These goggles are very lightweight, but actually work for me because I use them to protect my eyes while playing table tennis. I use them for tennis, too, but doubt that they would protect me as well as heavier-duty ones, if I were to be hit in the eye with a tennis ball. Also, I had to glue little nose pads on them, for comfort."
4,excellent,The feel a bit flimsy and cheap at first..But they are VERY comfortable and protect around the entire eye.
4,very comfortable but...,these safety glasses are very very comfortable and clear but they scratch way way too easily. they got a very noticeable cut it them the first time i wore them and i honestly dont know how. i never dropped them or got hit by anything. i even used a microfiber sunglass cleaning cloth to wipe the sweat and oil off of it. other than that i feel they offer great protection and visibility!
2,Not the best...,"Great price, fast shipping...but the glasses fog for me when I'm wearing an OR mask...and after about 3 hours wearing them I had a headache. Oh well."
2,Best Teri Copely Flick,"Best Teri Copely flick, but girl on cover of box is not teri copely, strange."
4,oxo utility knife,"This is a pretty good knife, but inferior to the prof. chef's version, that I really wanted and got later."
2,"Idea is great - Workouts Bad, Choppy, inconsistent","I was so excited to get this set of videos-they were shipped and arrived quickly - that much was great; Mr Shanahan's idea's are good - however, the actual workout sequences' are terrible - choppy, he'll do 3 reps on one side, then switch sides and do 6. Most of the workouts are cut/paste sections from the other workouts - no real rhyme or reason. As I watched, I kept thinking that the DVD was either skipping, or reversing."
3,good potential if not all clipped together,"While I really like working out with the Kettle Bell I have never seen an instructor use such shotty editing methods to make up a work-out series. Every work-out is a compilation of clips, not a single one is completed by the instructor and that to me is lazy and money oriented. I have work-out series where certain exercises are repeated but the instructor and cast are actually doing the work-outs and the instructor gives different directions and insight into the work out process while doing the exercises. This guy just clipped a bunch of stuff together so he never actually completes a single work-out, verbiage is repeated over and over, and he sells it as a work-out system. Real work out pros like Gilad, Tae Bo, Shuan T, and Jillian Michaels would never use such a lazy, cheap way to make a work-out series. I'd never buy anything by this instructor again."
4,Results as Advertised,"I've been using this program for two weeks. I was skeptical initially because most exercise programs with multiple videos only contain one routine per disc and give you the same routine week after week. This system is different. There are progressions as you gain more strength and endurance. I'll update again after week four.Results experienced to date: increased endurance, lost 3 lbs, attitude about working out totally changed--so excited."
4,Good,"The color are Good, and is ver y adjustable. It feels comfortable. The price are according TO the product described"
1,Comes Loose.,"I bought a large Hamilton collar like this one for a large dog (120#). Chasing a squirrel in the park and coming to an abrupt halt at the end of the lead, the steel ring on the collar can be jerked up to put pressure on the release tabs and voila! loose dog! Not something you want to happen around traffic or with people who are afraid of dogs."
3,Gloryland,"This CD is titled ""Gloryland"". I was interested in hearing what that sound like. It did not give me the option of hearing that song. I was going to buy it, but I don't know if it is the same Gloryland that I am thinking about. If the album is named after one of the songs, I think it should be at the top available for listing to the sample."
1,"Great Idea, Poor Execution and Quality",The unit I purchased had problems with the audio fading in an out with DVD player which was both distracting and annoying. The picture for the DVD was nonetheless excellent. The failure of the unit to up convert VCR output to the HDMI out cable was also a disappointment. I must echo the other comments that this design was ill conceived and the unit appears to lack sufficient quality control. My problems occurred right out of the box. Too bad because I generally have had a very good experience with Samsung products.
2,Worst DVD and worst service from Samsung,"I bought this DVD player a little over a year ago and it has been fine for what I use it for...just watching movies. Recently, the screen has split into 2 parts therefore it splits the movie in half. When I called technical I was told to send it in for an $80.00 repair plus shipping, of course. That's almost what I paid for it. They said there was nothing I could do to repair it myself and of course it's not under warranty. I am very disenchanted with Samsung products and service and probably will never buy another of their products."
3,Need a STB,I'm sure this would have been a good unit...however it wasn't clear that you needed a set top box to connect to the unit to record stuff...oh well..
4,Great DVD Quality,"Love the DVD player, don't use the recorder since my cable box doesn't have the RCA outputs. Still it was worth it for the DVD player. By the way, I'm watching on a 720p 30"" LCD."
4,Good value for the product,Hithis was much easier to setup than the last DVD/VCR combo that I had. The DVD quality is decent - not spectacular but well worth it for what i use the DVD player for - watching DVD's - mostly kids stuff.Good luck
4,Not a clear understanding,"The DVD player works well and seems of excellent quality. Pllaying DVDj's andd VCR's are bouth very good. However I did not understand that I would not be able to record programs on the VCR because of it not having a tuner and my not having a cable box, or whatever. It might be helpful to have more information for those of us who are technologically challenged. I kept it because for the most part is it serving its purpose."
2,Poor Performace,"I purchased this unit to go along with a Samsung 46 inch 1080 LCD, for several reasons. 1 was to get the best performace Samsung recommened it for upconverting dvds, but the most important reason was that they claimed that the remote was completely compatable for the tv and dvd/vcr, totally not true the dvd player remote works with nothing on the tv except for volume, and the tv remote barely works with the most basic dvd functions. Keep in mind that both units were purchased at the same time and were created by Samsung. The worst part is that the dvd player skips and the movie freezes approxmately every 15 to 30 seconds on alot of movies, yet these movies work fine on all other dvd players."
4,DVD V9700 review,I bought this product due to the DIVX playback. It has worked well without any problems. Picture quality great with DIVX playback and without the upconversion. The quality of TV makes or break the picture.
1,"Great idea, but no cigar!","The dvd player with HDMI connection worked great! The VHS had to be connected through its' own portal, it's signal cannot channel through the HDMI connection. The best VHS result I got was flashes of picture. I returned the unit last week, hoping for a complete refund. This unit does not have a tuner, so you cannot record VHS unless you have cable or satellite. This information is provided in the manual, but not on the Amazon site. Too bad!"
5,"A Very interesting book, worth reading.","Because my husband is a Homeopath, I came across this book and couldn't put it down. It really shows the different constitutional types, in the thinking and feeling processes. It's farely easy to find your own through reading the book, and shows how much of how we act in in our typing. I really enjoyed this information, and shared it with friends who also found great value in it. In the book ""The Complete Guide to Homeopathy"", there is a good test for quickly finding out your consitutional type also. Its a good combination book to go with this book. Thanks :-)"
5,Riveting!,"When I first bought this book (on recommendation from my classical homeopath), I couldn't stop reading it! It gave me a wonderful perspective on the various remedies, as well as a new view of my own constitutional remedy. It was also very interesting to speculate on my family and friends' constitutional remedies based on what I read here. Further, I especially enjoyed reading the numerous amusing anecdotes from the author's own practice.My only quibble is that the author frequently divides the remedies into male/female manifestations, and the descriptions of the gender less often represented by the remedy can be terse (as a Tuberculinum woman, I was naturally hoping for more info on my type :).Highly recommended!"
4,the essences,"After being trained in Greece by the master himself, Bailey has expanded on Vithoulkas's essences, giving a thematic overview of the mentality of each type-a useful project considering the mass of particuliars the practioner must know. It does not, as the title suggests, relate these mental states to the entirety of a person's being. Perhaps the closest comparison would be to Coulter and many of his descriptions differ from hers in a useful way, particulary with syphilinum. I guess this will have to do until Vit...'s publication of his entire materia medica vivus."
1,"I took the remedies in this book, I still have autism","I bought this book and followed the remedies as constructed in this book. However, I am still autistic. I guess it must be the mercury in my blood. It turns out that the active ingredient in the treatment he gives, mercury, is diluted to the point in which it no longer can exist. Time for me to get chelation therapy...except that has also been disproven."
5,Life changing book,"If I'd acquired this knowledge of personalities in my 20 my whole life would have been different. I would not have wasted my time and life and health on unavailable men like Tuberculinum, I would have made better choices regarding my own path and would not have judged myself so harshly for being who I am.This stuff should be taught in high schools, regardless of effectiveness, or not, of homeopathy.So much better than astrological profiling, way more accurate.Brilliant writing, concise and clear."
4,An insightful book.,"This book highlights the way persons needing the remedies think and act and helps a lot in looking for traits, asking confirmatory questions or to differentiate between similar remedies. Although well written, I have stopped short of a five-star rating as only 35 remedies have been covered."
2,Freckles Duvet Polyester Insert,"The product looks decent when you take it out of the wrapping..however when it is put into the duvet cover and someone sleeps under it, the thin polyester contents bulk up and there is no stitching in block form or whatever to keep it in place, I would not recommend it at all."
4,Could be better if it had more (and closer spaced) teeth,"This knife does a decent enough job of cutting sandwiches, meat, fruit and even vegetable. My only issue is I'm used to similar knives with more teeth, which in turn makes them easier to navigate around bruised areas (of fruit or vegetables) and similar cuttings tasks. It's a decent kitchen knife, but more teeth would make it a really great kitchen knife.Being an Oxo, the grip is very comfortable."
3,OXO tomator knife,"So-so. Fine for tomatoes and other soft things. The large handle might be helpful for folks with arthritis, etc. The same knife is available at ACE hardware for under $9. Buy it there, instead."
2,You Can Get a Better Knife for Less $$....,Cuts tomatoes and veggies well. Handle is nice but blade seems kinda flimsy. Go buy a cheap-o knife at the store and save some dough
1,never buy a toy from this buyer again,"this toy is nothing like it was described in the ad and is not even good enough to be considered a toy, it is a piece of junk, and didnt have all the parts it needed to put it together, i am so disappointed thati would never buuy anthing from this buyer again."
2,Great pen.... when it actually works,I thought this would be a great pen after looking at the reviews online. It constantly stops writing and the ink dries up!! You have to shake it or open the pen up and squeeze the ink cartridge to get the ink flowing again. Even with a brand new cartridge the ink still stops all the time. Waste of money!
2,Frightening portrayal of the future,"The first time I read this book was for a social studies project in ninth grade. At the time, I found it disconcerting for its view that religion and traditional values are futile, and that humanity will eventually become God-like in its ability to surmount nature. Looking back now from the perspective of another ten years of education - I can see that this book is a late 20th century manifestation of the deterministic narrative of perpetual progress through reason alone that was perfected by Hegel, Toynbee and Marx in the last century. History has shown that human progress is not always inevitable, and that both traditional values and religion are resilient in the face of change. Jefferson believed we would all be Unitarians by the second American century. Evangelicalism is on the rise in America in the early 21st century. All in all, this book is interesting but frightening - if only for what it says about the ""progressive"" movement's grand design for humanity."
4,Great nostalgic illustrations,My kids ages 3 to 6 liked this book very much.They like this read to them and they like to read it over and over. They are always looking for new things in the detail of the illustrations. We also have Camping spree with Mr. Magee which is equally good.
2,Nice Book but,"Nice book for children but the print is Way too small. There is plenty of room to make the print a little larger.The first thing my 7 yr old Daughter said was ""the words are too small"".I'd give this book 5 stars if not for that."
5,A Magnificiant and Clever Author!,I purchased this book because I loved his book The Circus Ship. I was not disappointed! Each book by this author has been a delight. The illustrations and poetic storytelling are outstanding. Books by this author are real keepers. I would purchase every book I could find by this author.
4,Dee and Magee stuck in a tree,It's really funny you should read it. The pictures are good. We love Dee the dog. We liked it better than Learning to ski with Mr. Magee.
5,Winx Club!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I starting watching Winx Club back in 2004, when i was 14, and i totally fell in love with the show. i then starting it on cartoon network on mondays-sundays. then, when i turned 15 in 2005, it then only came on channel 75, fox tv, they took it off cartoon network when the last episode was over and they started all over and the next day it didn't come back on cartoon network. I record every single Winx Club episode on channel 75 every saturday morning 9:00-10:00. the second one ends at 10:30.every saturday i wake up at 8:00am.Winx Club Is The Best Tv Show Ever!!!!!Winx Club Rules!!!!Come Join The Club!We Are The Winx!!!!Chelseaage 15p.s.I HAVE THE 2 WINX THEMES MEMORIZED!!!!!WHICH MEANS I CAN REMEBER THE WORDS!!!"
3,"Get the OATMEAL Chocolate Chip, not these.","Get the OATMEAL chocolate chip, the trail mix, or the oatmeal raisin versions-- they're all delicious (esp. the oatmeal chocolate chip!) When Whole Foods was out of the oatmeal chocolate chip I made the mistake of buying these. They're ok, but nothing amazing. The Oatmeal Chocolate Chip ones are a definite 5 stars though! Better than the Trader Joes copy cat cookies!"
4,Feels good,"I like this vibrator for the most part. I think it's just the right size although you need to ""warm up"" a little before inserting it. It is quiet and solid yet flexible. It would be more fun if you had someone to use it on you, for you. The knob part at the end is good for lots of things!"
1,You get what you pay for!,This product really sucks. It is uncomfortable and does nothing for me! It went in the trash.. UGH!
1,severely unhappy,"the only good thing i can say about this product was that it arrived before the estimated arrival date. i had been anxious for it to arrive, wanting to try something different, yet i can't bring myself to even try. the color is fine but how anyone could get past the putrid smell and sticky feel is beyond me. i thought maybe it needs to be washed and aired out. nope - that didn't help at all. and sadly to say i had ordered another similar to this one and it is just as bad. trust me, don't waste your time or money on ordering these. lesson learned for me? check them out in a store before trying to buy online."
4,Nice Toy,This one is fairly nice. It bends more than most toys of its kind do. I have no regrets purchasing this item.
5,"Simple, practical, & cheap!","All I can say about this clipboard is that it is simple, practical, and cheap! I didn't realize the clipboard had ruler measurements on both the left and right sides, but was pleasantly surprised that it did. This makes the clipboard even more useful and multi-functional. I can't complain since I pretty much got what I expected."
4,plastic clipboards,"I thought I would be able to select my color, but I couldn't. I got all clear ones though, so that was ok."
4,gave good back ground information on Gil Elvgren,"I am a begining collector of pin ups and I would recomend this book to people who are just starting out. It gives good basic background information on Elvgren as well as some of his best work. If you like drawn pin ups of the 30's, 40's and 50's. This book is for you."
1,Way Way....too sweet..............,"I like rasbery syrup on ice cream and saw this product on line.It 's way way too sweeet ,,full of cane sugar...i woud not reccomend this or any other of their products."
2,not as good as others from the series,"This book is well written but doesn't have enough good quality pictures and is too brief in some important topics.It's one of those books you can feel the author is really trying to teach you something and not just write some stuff. But it doesn't have enough pictures / schemes and a lot of the CT and MR images are old, poor quality and sometimes not representative. The book is one of the shortest of the requisites series and sometimes doesn't cover enough aspects of some particular topics. There's not a word about specific collateral vessels in portal hypertension.I have had a great experience with the Mayo Clinic Gastrointestinal Imaging Review book which I would recommend instead."
1,waste of time & money,"despite abundant imagesi found this book inaccurate, badly written and confusingi do not recommend it at all"
2,Gastrointestinal Imaging: The Requisites 3rd edition,I am a practicing radiologist and instructor. This text is poorly written and poorly organized.
3,good as intro but not in-depth enough,"i think this book would serve as a good intro, but there is not enough detail regarding specific imaging characteristics of common things -- I am less interested in knowing about phytobezoars (though they are fun for the whole family!) than about MRI appearance of FNH. i need more meat. well, i'm off to lunch."
4,exactly what i ordered fast shipping,i recieved this cable within one week after ordering with standard shipping. the cable is more precise than the auto parts store version. more robust than the origional. im not sure if it will last forever because i just needed this part to sell a 94 geo tracker so this is as far as the review will go.
1,The worse text book ever,"I am currently using this textbook for my undergraduate course. The whole class complains on how the books gives one definition for one thing and then turn around and provide a totally diffent definition. We all find it really difficult to concentrate reading this book, when there is no color or any outlines to go by."
1,Copy cat,"Badly return overly verbose book.Has copied too many things from too many other books and has failed to acknowledge the sources.No author index, no complete reference listing.There better books for DSS. chota phree stuff."
3,decision support systems & intelligent systems,"There is a need for such a book as its subject elements are eclectic in nature. Some integration effort exist in this edition but is far from being completed. By trying to be up-to date the book takes a form of a poor encyclopedia. It would have been much better to reduce the explosion of concepts to concetrate on few that are generic with well developped examples and illustrations. So at the end the student will say ""yes I understand"". The conclusion today is by most of my students ""too [much money] """
2,Wrong Book with Right Intesion,"The author has lost the track. He should have concentrated inone area than mixing up all topics. The presentation isreally bad for readers to understand. As most of the reader mentioned, there is a need for a good book in this area, but this is not the right one."
3,Rambling book,"This book could get away with about 2/3 the volume of content still be interesting. There really does not seem to be any structure to the way a chapter flows. Its easy to skim, but difficult to read.Good case studies;The connection with the web is a little over-emphasized and sometimes unclear. I'd prefer a dense read, with some concise messages.This is a good course text, not a favorite though."
1,throw it into the trash,"Used it for school, found it dry, boring, ugly. I got frustrated every time I picked up the book. Really want to throw it into the trash if not for the resell value."
5,Fascinating Alternate History,"Sometime in 1969, a CIA analyst writes a paper stating that the race to the Moon, recently won by Apollo 11, has been a strain on the Soviet economy and military. President Nixon, casting around for a way to pressure Moscow into negotiating arms control treaties, decides to expand the space race. What follows is one half satire one half adventure. It ends with a privately funded, commercial space ship on a mission to rescue the Apollo 23 astronauts who are trapped on the Moon."
1,Just What I Expected,"I decided to pick this book up after reading a few of Whittington's social commentary posts online...wow. Really should have kept my money.Not only were his social insights anything but insightful, his writing was a much worse case.The characters: laughable. The dialogue: much more so. The writing style: reminiscent of 8th grade creative writing class. There was just nothing redeeming in this book whatsoever."
1,Worst ever,Don't waste your money. This book is nearly impossible to read. It's as if the writer is fumbling with a newly learned language. The plot is sketchy at best and the 'political intrigue' is boring and laughably unbelievable.
1,They will print anything these days!,"I'll be short and sweet. Years ago, you would go through scrutiny before getting published. Thank goodness the book was in the stack of already read paperbacks at work. We do a reading exchange. If I had purchased this, I would have been mad at myself. What a waste of my time when I could have read something else."
2,"disappointing, particularly for the price...","I decided to pay for the more expensive unit of all availiable, in hopes that it would be a better quality. I use filtered water, and after just a few weeks of use, have noticed the aluminum pitting in the lower half or base of unit. In addition to the pitting, when I use a towel to wipe it dry, a grey gel substance comes off on my towel. I'm actually planning on returning the unit. So disappointing."
4,Great for one cup of coffee...,"This Moka pot makes an excellent cup of coffee. I forgot that this is actually an espresso maker, so the size I ordered was too small for coffee. I'm keeping it, though, since it works really well. The key is to keep the heat low (takes about 10 minutes to boil). It's really simple and it doesn't leak. I highly recommend this product. In addition, it is much better looking and easier to store away than a traditional electric coffee pot."
2,FUN FOR A WHILE !,"WANTED TO TRY IT............DID.................THE COFFEE IS TOO EXPENSIVE........CAN'T USE ORDINARY COFFEE...........HAS TO BE VERY VERY FINE GRIND. OH WELL, THE LOCAL THRIFT STORE WILL FIND A NEW OWNER !"
1,WHY BERGIN'S BASICS SHOULD BE IN YOUR HOME...,"Don't pass by this book.It tells it all.How we can be so much better and more successfull in our lives if we want.How we can really set a goal and go for it.By thinking strongly about ourselves and knowing that we can do anything,if we put our mind and soul into it.Have faith and beleive in yourselve.I myself have read this book 2 times.Its hard to put down.It is just wonderful.I have had the pleasure of talking to Dr.Bergin's on the internet.A very frienly respectful person...I do belevie once you get this book you will not put it down.Its wonderful and i think everyone should have a copy."
3,mediocre,The version of The Planets here is acceptable but not more. The coupling is one of the least desirable I have seen. The fantasia on Greensleaves reminds me of elevator music and the theme of thomas tallis is more interesting but outlasts its welcome. I usually like Vaughn Williams but not in this particular case. I would get my version of Holst's orchestral masterwork elsewhere. I'm just glad I borrowed this from the local library and so can still look elswhere myself.
2,dont' waste your money,"There is probably only one good song on this album. Don't waste your time or money on this garbage, it is a bunch of swag."
5,Night Light Bulbs,"I bought this as a replacement for my flea trap. They work very well, and keep the trap area nice and warm (perfect to attract fleas). Great buy!"
5,Can use as replacement Kenmore refrigerator dispenser light,"I have a Kenmore refrigerator with an in-door water/ice dispenser. I noticed the light bulb in the dispenser had burned out so I searched around and found these bulbs. They work just fine as replacements. Since it is a pack of 4 bulbs I assume I won't have to worry about re-ordering for several years.(Technically the Kenmore manual specifies a 6-Watt 120V bulb but at 7-Watts these were close enough. I searched Amazon for quite a while and couldn't find a 6-Watt bulb. Also, my refrigerator model is 596.51679100 in case you are curious.)"
3,nite lite,"they are good , give off a nice glow not much you can say about nite lites............hope they last haven't had them that long......."
1,unclear Misleading,"I ordered the other product along with this bulbs. Both products had the same mark in the pictures, ""4 pack""/""3 pack"".and The other product came 3 packs as the mark indicated, and this product came only one pack.Even The big title says 4 pack, Not 4 bulbs.Yes, I did read thoroughly before I ordered this bulbs. it stated 4 bulbs per pack. Nothing says this's 1 pack.Intentionally misleading.Both products were sold by amazon, It's very disappointing."
4,Worthy farewell to a great band,"This recording from Magnum's farewell tour is a worthy end to a fine career.Highlights would have to be Les Morts Dansant and The Last Dance.Even if you have Magnum's earlier live album 'The Spirit', this is still a worthwhile addition to your collection."
5,solid and easy to mount,I needed more places to stash my stuff and my Rack seemed like the perfect place. Bought three of these and they did the trick.Comes with two keys and really nice mounting hardware
2,Not Great,"We've had this mower for about 3 years. It stalls if the grass is a bit too long, or if it is at all wet. It generally holds a charge okay, but we can't mow both our front and back lawn on one charge. The bolts that hold the handle together have broken and now the handle is not rigid enough to push the mower comfortably. Guess we'll have to replace them all and see what happens. In general, it is not great quality and is pretty gutless."
3,Use on Small Yards Only,"My yard was approximately 15x30 and this was an ideal mower to take care of the weekly mow. The only downfall I have to this item is the need to mow weekly, as high grass and this mower do not get along so well. Do not expect to mow a 1/2 acre with this mower without having some regrets. Works great for small city lots."
2,Bully 16-Inch Cordless,"I originally gave this item a good review. It was light and easy to use. I liked the smaller size which made storage in my garage easier. And it seemed to do the job for my small yard. My favorable opinon changed for two reasons: First it proved to be underpowered for longer or wet grass. Even mowing once a week, I ended up mowing some areas twice because it had trouble cutting the grass. But the bigger concern was the battery gradually lost its ability to hold a charge the first summer I owned it. It takes about 40 minutes or so to mow my small yard. Halfway through the summer I couldn't mow my entire yard with one charge. But the end of the summer I would have to recharge my mower twice to in order to mow my lawn. A battery that does not last even one summer makes this not a good buy."
3,Cordless Mower,"Great mower for small enclosed areas, 5 stars. Not a bunch of stuff forcefully flying out like my 6.5 HP gas mower, its quite to use, and for level areas anyone that can walk can use this mower. For larger lawns it was slow due to it's size, 3 stars. For overgrown thick lawn grass, it takes much effort to keep it from bogging down. 1 star. Overall 3 stars. It was able to cut down many 18"" tall weeds along the lawn OK. It just didn't like the thick lawn stuff. Run time was good, 40 minutes more or less. I have also tried the BD CMM1000 and newer CMM1200, but I am still looking for a cordless mower that works like the better gas mowers. I will be testing a new imported cordless mower next to see how that holds up. I would like to market a really good cordless mower but I am still looking."
4,Bully mower great for small lawns,"I recently purchased this mower to replace a B&D; corded mower. While the 16"" blade requires more passes than the 19"" did, the lack of cord hassles makes the pushing much easier. And the Bully costs much less than the B&D; cordless. Seems well built and durable.My only regret is the fact that this mower does not mulch. But is is the perfect option for my 15 minute lawn!"
1,Dont't buy this cordless mower,"Stick to the old fashioned mowers. We fully charged the battery and attempted to start the mower. But it would not work. At first the relay switch would trip and turn the engine off after only a few seconds. Then the engine would not even start. Then sparks would fly from the black lead where you plug the charger. Now the plug won't even go into the mower. The grass is not very long, the grass is not wet, the key is fully inserted, the battery is fully charged. In short, the thing should work but it does not. The idea of a cordless mower sounds great, but don't fall for it. I emailed OMyGarden but I find I have no recourse, which is a problem when you buy online and not from a neighborhood store."
2,The jury is still out...,"I've only had my Bully lawn mower for a week now, and am still trying decide whether or not it was a wise purchase. I've already had several plastic bits & pieces fall off after only cutting my grass one and half times, and have had to scour the lawn trying to find them. The most recent piece that fell off held the handle together, which made for an awkward cutting of the grass. I am REALLY hoping Bully is telling the truth about how the battery builds up power after multiple chargings, as right now I am barely able to get my small front yard cut before the battery dies. I also think it doesn't have the power to cut some of the thicker grass in my back yard. I probably wouldn't recommend it, at least not so far, which bums me out as I really liked the idea of not using GAS to power a lawn mower..."
5,Give it some time...,"Even though I did read the info saying it would take the battery some time to come to a full charge I was initially diappointed with the power of this little mower. I have a good sized yard and planned on mowing half at a time. It still seemed lower than my expectation of the power described but perhaps that is because I had a Black & Decker cordless electric for 6 years. The cost to have it repaired was more than the Bully so I decided to give it a try. I cannot believe this is the same Bully mower I was using a month ago! It will do my whole yard if I do not allow the grass to get too high. I do not know why it took so long for the battery to fully charge but it is now the mower I had hoped for, so lightweight compared to the B&D and convenient to use. Just give it some time before you make a final judgment."
4,Good on PA terraced yard,Our lot has 4 different terrace levels that grow grass. My gas mower is just too heavy to get from one space to another so I have used a weed eater for where I couldnt get the old mower. I ordered this bully mower due to its light weight. I works good as my gas mower ever worked and goes wherever I want it to. The lower part of the handle is a good lifting point. Seems well built and hasnt run out of power yet. Cutting height is hard to adjust but I did it once and dont think I ever have to adjust it again. I looked at the Black and Decker but it is heavy and costs $200 more. Good buy.
2,Cheap is as cheap does...,This thing is cheap... That is the only plus.It is small so it takes that much more passes to cut the lawn.There is no grass catcher! I guess living in Los Angeles I got spoiled because no one else ever mentioned this. WOW... People actually rake after mowing now-a-days? Sheesh!The wheel axles and just about everything else associated with this lawn mower do not seem very sturdy.It might be sold by an American company but it has the look and feel of a cheap import.
1,Funny thing.....,"Maddie Hatter states that the mower arrived in 2 days from order. If you look at OMyGarden Shipping Rates they state the following:Continental US Street ETA 3 - 7 daysThey do not have expedited shipping. So unless Maddie lives just nextdoor of OMyGarden headquarters, this 5 star review seems to me made up by someone keen to the company.I accept that I might be wrong.... but it makes you think."
1,Still waiting for replacement.......,"I've had this ""useless"" mower for over 6 weeks now....it worked for 20 mins hasnt worked since..... I have been told mine was a re-call, and they would send a replacement part.....now I'm just getting the run around...no parts to send !!!!"
1,gutless,"nice and light but just bogs down with the slightest resistance. Haven't noticed that the battery has improved after many uses, in fact seems to be holding its charge for shorter and shorter. My lawn isn't huge or particularly thick. Kind of bummed that i have to by a back up battery just to finish one small section of grass. In my opinion, they need to look at some different battery types (ie: lithium ion) and perhaps boost the voltage as well. I would happily try some kind of retrofit if and when they offer it, but I think I will be in the market for a more powerful mower and chalk this up to a losing bet..."
3,Dead battery,The mower worked well for the first season but I belive the battery did not survive the winter it wont take a full charge.
4,Good deal,"The valve seems to be very good quality. It is heavy and solid, and was easy to install. Although it works for threaded or copper pipe, I used adapters to connect it to my old 1/2 inch copper pipes. The only thing I don't like is the shower head, so I didn't use it. It might be O.K., but it looks cheap, and I had a better one lying around. Overall a good deal for the price."
5,the monster squad,the monster squad I watched this movie when I was about 6-7 I loved this movie.I watched It over and over again you have to get this movie for your kids.
5,One of my favorite movies EVER,"my god, I grew up loving this movie, this is one of my favorite movies. Finally coming to DVD, used to rent it on VHS all the time."
5,CLASSICS,"If you love the Goonies, then you'll love The Monster Squad, I'd like to thank Lionsgate for bringing it out in DVD, I shared this movie with my son when it first released and he has never forgotten it, when I told him it would be released on DVD he was excited because he can't wait to share it with his son. The action is great, the villians are great actors, but the Monster Squad makes the movie, believe me if you haven't seen it this will be a great investment for your children down the road, or for your grandchildren, I kept my vhs version, & I play it at all my nieces, nephews,godchildren & grandchildrens birthday parties and they always turn out to be the best part of the parties!"
4,Wolfman's Got Nards!!!,I rembered this movie when my son and I were looking for movies at the video store and found Goonies. Loved it back then...still good for me but for him it was great just like it was for me back then.
5,BEST CHILDHOOD MOVIE,"This has to be one of the best movies I ever saw when I was young, although today I dont remember much of it I know that I loved it...I have been trying to find this movie on tape or dvd for a few years and i cannot find it anywhere. If anyone knows where I can find it either online or in store (in montreal) please let me know!!!"
5,Great old movie,"My daughters loved this movie when they were young, so I ordered it in blu-ray for my grand children's enjoyment. Again great prices and its blu-ray."
5,ULTIMATE NOSTALGIA,"If there was one movie to complete my movie collection it would be ""The Monster Squad."" If there were any reasons why anybody buy this movie is because it activates every emotion possible from excitement, disappointment, revenge, such as Horace was saved by the ""cool teen in the leather jacket,"" to an Creature fromthe Black Lagoon was killed by Horace and confronted the school bullies. Tears to my eyes when Frankenstein was pulled into the Black Hole say bye to Phoebe. It would be a great tradgedy if this film was not released in DVD, it is a time in the 80's when movies were made with the special EFX it was made with. This something my kids(who are now adults) would like to share with their kids. Hope these comments will have the big Movie companies can release, they have released other D movies, it would not hurt to release this cute movie.SincerelyMom from Texas"
2,"Back on Blu, empty on extras","It's a big risk to mix action and comedy, because if you get the balance wrong, the element left in the minority feels out of place and ruins the rest. Mix in kids and horror, and you could possibly end up with a muddled mess. In Dekker and Black's hands though, this recipe paid off in a classic adventure film that may not have been a hit when first released, but, like many cult films, it's grown on people and been rediscovered on videotape and cable. Unfortunately, the best chance to relish the film came and went in 2009 with the out-of-print Lionsgate release, but it's nice to still have the option to pick up the film for those who missed out. The thing is, as of this writing, you can still pick up the previous Blu-Ray used for the same price or less, which makes it very hard to give this one anything more than a 2 star rating."
5,great little monster movie,"This is one great little monster movie I have watched over and over again. Like some of the other reviews, I don't understand why this is not on dvd. I have the vhs copy and not wanting to lose the visuals, I transferred it to dvd. The storyline is well done and these kids make this movie, especially the little girl. When she walks out behind the bush holding Frankensteins hand and the other kids run off, I laughed out loud. As the others said, the special effects are nothing like they are now, but I have no complaints about them. The movie was great, the acting fantastic, and the whole concept just great. So hurry it up and bring it out on dvd. I,ll defintiely buy a copy."
3,I expected better,"When everyone kept talking about The Monster Squad and how good it was I wanted to see it for myself. I expected it to be a masterpiece having all the old Universal monsters in one movie and it was directed by Fred Dekker(Night of the Creeps), but it totally failed.The plot was alright, but most kids won't be able to understand it. The movie also gets kind of boring, because the scenes focusing on the kids really weren't that interesting and jokes were not funny.Anyways I would only recommend this to a fan of the Universal monster movies and fans of Fred Dekker, this defintly not better than his first movie ""Night of the Creeps"""
5,Monster Squad,I had been looking for this movie everywhere for the last 5 yrs and I am so glad to have it now!!! I love this movie. It's a one of a kind. I especially like the sound effects and also the interviews with the now actors. Everyone should see this movie if they like spooky/horror movies. A+++++++++++++ all the way!!
5,WOW!,Amazing movie! I love this movie! Kind of a low budget movie but the costumes are great and the story is pretty awesome also. A MUST SEE for anyone who loves the classic monsters.
5,FOR THE LOVE OF GOD HURRY UP!!!!,"When in the Holy Handgernade of Antiok are they going to put this out on DVD? I mean, we have Goonies, Willy Wonka (Watch for Tim B.'s version Summer of '05), and many other classics from many or our early years, but why not this one yet? And might I add that thanks to this movie, the word 'Nards' still remains in my vocabulary. ^_^"
5,Bring it Back!,My mother taped this movie when it was on T.V. and my boys (3 and 5) love it. My problem is I taped over it and now I have two very upset children. Please re-release this movie and get me out of the dog house. Laurie
5,join the squad!,"I love this movie! Perfect for Hallowe'en viewing and a great lark.Reghr is wonderful.Noonan - can I keep him? The kids are out of this world...how sad to hear horace died..The grown ups provide a safe arena and the kids save the world.Terific print, great sound and sensible price.What more could I say?"
5,Review of Monster Squad,Great movie. I had watched it in the 80's when it was out on VHS. My kids were younger than. They still love it as adults.It is a classic that is well done!
5,Awesome,"I bought this movie because I like it a lot, but my 7 yr old daughter and her friends just love it. This is a treat to get without all the gore one gets from other scary children movie."
4,Finally on DVD!!!,I had been waiting for this movie to be released on DVD for a long time. This was a great movie from my childhood and realized when I watched it as an adult that it still has the same appeal. It is the movie Goonies with monsters basically. Hopefully my son enjoys this film as much as I did when I was a kid.
4,Fun movie,My son age 18 has asked for this movie for x-mas i remember him laughing and watching this movie over and over. My husband and I enjoyed it also.
4,Monster memories!,"This is one of those magical films from my childhood which was watched, watched and watched again. We even learned the words of the monster squad theme song. Everyone remembers this movie but no-one can get a copy. Tragedy!"
5,Your twenty something will love it!,"I taped this movie onto a VHS tape from HBo when my oldest was 7 years old. She watched it so many times that she wore out the tape! Now that she is a mom, I am getting it for her to share with her 6 year old.It's a scary movie that a six year old can watch and not have nightmares for a month. Don't pass this one up."
5,Monster Squad 20th Anniversary Two Disc Special Edition,"My 14 year old grandson has been wanting this movie for a very long time. It is everything he remembered. The movie is full of adventure, edge-of-your-seat suspense, a little mystery, and fast-paced. No time to be bored."
2,Not Up To The Goonies,"If you really like The Goonies, you'll find this only a fair movie. It consists of poor attempts at slapstick, unsuccessful suspense, and unnecessary foul language and humor about virginity, all delivered by some B-grade acting. It is not really appropriate for young children, and anyone else should find it unsatisfying. (I can't account for any rave reviews.)"
1,No wonder it took 20 years to come out on DVD.,I bought it after hearing the buzz on film geek sites. The references to The Goonies are ridiculous. This movie is a waste of time and space. Got it for my kids who watched it once and have not asked again.Waited for it to get decent and it never surpassed below average.What amazes me is how you can find the 5 kids in hollywood that can't carry a picture and assemble them all in one movie.
1,What? this isn't no classic,"Who in the hell said this was a classic, it was a dud when it was released and it's a dud now."
4,good fun,"A very enjoyable film.My kids love it.Some PG-13 themes but all in all clean fun.Dracula teamed with updates of universal monsters Wolfman,the Creature,the Mummy,and Frankenstein run head to head with some precosious and resourceful kids who manage to outwit Dracula and his goons with the help of their new ally Frankenstein."
5,Coolest movie of my life,"This is probably the movie that I've seen the most times in my life. It's so great, and where can I get Shawn's shirt that says: Stephen King Rules? When The Wolfman is attacking him and Shawn is yelling Kick him in the nards!, it doesn't get much better than that. I love this movie, and everyone should see it and it should DEFINITELY be rereleased. Anyone else agree?"
5,Don't go Frankie!!! (It only took him 20 years to come back),"Yes, Pheobe, Frankie is back! And so is Gillman, The Count, The Wolfman, and the Mummy in the closet. Like others posted reviews here, I have so many fond memories as an adolescent boy watching this movie over and over (more so than Lost Boys). I have been waiting a long time for this to be released on DVD and am really excited that it's a 2-disc set! Now, I can show my friends the movie I've been bragging about for all these years, and can have a clear copy, rather than borrowing the bootlegged VHS tape off of my father. 3 thumbs up for Lionsgate!!!!!"
5,Great nostalgic value,Loved this movie as a kid and just re-watched it after receiving it as a christmas gift. So many great memories.
5,Monster Squad,I loved this movie when it came out and glad they made a DVD of it. My children loved it also. Really enjoyed the interviews with the cast now and what they are doing.
3,Not a concert DVD but a decent documentary,"This DVD is better left as a video documentary of the people who fuel that great Chieftains sound. It is not a concert DVD and songs are heard in snatches rather than in whole. There are interesting interviews with the members of the band as well as artists who collaborated on The Black Veil album, especially Sting. This does prove in a pleasant fashion that musicians who lead quiet lives, who do not engage in substance abuse, egotism, vulgarity or vandalism, can be fascinating and worth attending to. The discussion is intelligent and not the least bit sentimental or melodramatic like VH1's Behind the Music series. In the end, though, little use is put to the DVD technology and it is frustrating not to hear the songs in their entirety. I have to wonder if that was the plan all along or if copyright and permissions issues defeated a more musical approach."
1,"Disappointing, Worse than bad",.After reading the reviews I thought maybe everyone was being a little harsh. I listened to a used copy in a record store and understood why the reviews were harsh. No wonder the used copy was where it was.This DVD isn't even worth reviewing.
2,"Long on History, short on ""How To"" knowledge","The book had a long review of the historical and artistical developments related to the pinhole camera. I was hoping that it would have more information on building a camera and solving many of the problems that pinhole photographers struggle with, such as changing the film. I wanted more ideas or different plans for building your own camera, not just pictures of cameras that others had built. There is a nice chapter on zone plates."
5,The 'bible' of pinhole photography,"If you only buy one book on pinhole photography, this is the one to get. It provides the background, the basics of how to do it, and plenty of examples of the diversity and richness of expression within this area of photography."
3,"Comfortable, but very wide",These shoes are comfortable for casual use. (They do not have any arch support so might not be the best for a lot of walking.) They are definitely wider than standard width shoes.
3,Freestyle Forever,I bought this some time ago and the cd is great because of the different artists and the popular songs.
5,Beautiful tones!,This recorder has lovely deep tones and is a joy to hear! We use them for midevil and baroque music for a truly authentic sound.
5,Beautiful Tone!,"This instrument has a very nice tone. Unquestionably, reaching for middle-C is tough and will take some serious getting used to. The feel of the instrument is, nonetheless, great. It's solid, though it's made from some sort of plastic.=>PW"
4,A Quality Instrument,"I did not purchase this from Amazon, I purchased this one from my local music store. After purchasing the YRA-302B and The YRS-302B from Amazon, I couldn't resist the YRT-304B. Of the three, this is the easiest to play and has the best tone.I wear L/XL gloves and the dreaded stretch of the Tenor Recorder is no problem. Don't be afraid to purchase this recorder, it is easy to play.If Amazon delivers this recorder in the same time frame as the others I ordered, you will not only be satisfied with the recorder, but also the delivery time.Yamaha produces quality recorders."
1,Unusable,"I am a professional musician. This item is not even minimally useable. The low notes below E will barely sound. The instrument is out of tune. Yamaha has agreed to evaluate the instrument. Results pending. Update: Yamaha has looked over this recorder and assessed that it functions as designed. The warranty service personnel were exemplary with excellent service and personal contact. Unfortunately, the low D and C remain problematic. I recommend that purchasers evaluate this recorder upon receipt so that return is possible if you find it problematic."
2,Just ok,"This is a very amateurish recorder, not even suitable for kids. Sounds weak and cheap. Other Yamaha recorders I use play much better. Stay away from this tenor."
5,Santoku,"This product does all it claims. I have arthritis in my hands and usually find it difficult to chop veggies, etc. This knife makes chopping quick and easy. With a gentle rocking motion of the blade, preparing a salad is no longer a ""big deal."""
5,As good as the larger version,"We have the larger Oxo Sentoku Knife and were very impressed with it, so we purchased the smaller model here too. It is every bit as good as the larger one, but in a more compact knife. The blade will require sharpening after a while, but it comes shipped very sharp and ready to cut. Great for cutting stuff that generally sticks to the blade. Excellent product at a great price!"
5,Perfect little knife!,"I love this knife! It is my first choice now when cooking! It's perfect for fruit, and taco night! Definitely a great purchase and the handle is GREAT on this one!"
4,A very good knife for the money,"While it could easily be a lot sharper the handle is just great and the price is just about perfect. This is my first Oxo knife, but it sure won't be my last. My favorite knife is a 7"" Shun Santoku, but you have to look at value for the money and that's where this knife has very few peers."
3,Fun but nothing special,My son saw these at a toy store and wanted them for his 4th birthday. They were inexpensive enough that I ordered them. He thinks they are cool but doesn't play with them all that much. You can't really see through them well as they have the eyeballs painted on the end. They don't seem to magnify like real binoculors so I'm not sure what the point is but I don't watch Spongebob. Maybe there is something in one of the episodes about him having binocs that intrigues my son.
4,Binoculars,This was for my 3 year old grandson. They are a little hard to see out of. I think he was to young for this toy.
4,Ki84 Fans Need this Book,"Well written with excellent historical text and clear era photographs. Some detail pictures, like the cockpit and control surfaces, are lacking as most photos are of the aircraft exterior."
5,Another in Happy Baby Series,Songs:Happy BabyGood Morning SunshineMorning Has BrokenFive Little PiggiesI Sing For YouLittle SnailHere Comes The SunFlag in the WindHello! Here I AmHippity Hoppity RiderBrother JohnBaby's Good Morning
2,Thumbs down to relaibility but thumbs UP to picure quality,The DV input broke. Send for repair got it fixed but broke again while buring DVDs. I get screen freez after few minutes of recording.Samsung is sending brand new uunit model DVD-R160. Will have to see how it works.
2,Quick Kelly Slater,"Review in short: I was looking for a surfing movie having loved Step into Liquid and Riding Giants. This wasn't that type of movie at all. Like others said, if you like Kelly Slater, you may find this interesting. I was not impressed with the length or content based on the price I spent. I would have rather borrowed this from a friend then buy it; now it's just going to collect dust.Two stars because I like Kelly Slater.Wanna borrow it?"
2,Thunder ridge and Monster Trucks,Got this for my son to play because he likes Monster Trucks so much. But It's honestly one of the worst DS games I've seen both in creativity and graphics.
4,Good game,I bought this game for my three year old Grandson and he really loves it. It was a great deal for the price.
4,ATV Combo,"I am not sure how this prodct i, we just got it for a christmas present, but it seems like it will be fun."
1,BAD game,"I bought this for my 6 year old son, this is by far the worst game he's ever played on DS. I thought i was getting a good deal with 2 games, turns out, ya get what ya pay for. It's crap! I wouldn't even give this game a star but it wouldnt let me post it without giving it at least one."
3,Good to know what you're up against,"The only thing this book really has going for it is explaining what the AHPAT will be like when you go in the day of the test. I used this book to prepare and found the overview of sciences close to worthless. You can't expect a 300 page book to review biology, chemistry, o-chem, and math in great detail, but the attempt half-hearted. They threw together some science information, and even left out some pictures/diagrams. Final word: Don't expect to have the science content to refrence in this book, but DO learn how the APHAT is structured."
3,inappropriate title,This is one of the few books teaching readers how to get into transcendental meditation. Most TM experts claim that TM cannot be learnt from a book or tape. It is a good book with all kinds of meditations and solid cases. However it doesn't deal exclusively with TM. The subject of 'Mantras' a distinctive feature of TM is not mentioned at all. This book is very much an inspirational book like those by Norman Vincent Peale or Joseph Murphy. But is is quite well written and worth reading
3,Started me in Chi Gong,"I have a bunch of other books about this form of exercise but this book is the first one that got me started. All of the other's are a better book but they want to give you the complete history of their form, or of Tai Chi, instruct you in breathing and standing and you are damn lucky if you find a posture before the mid point of the book.Not this book--you dive right in and she tells you later about the postures--I like that."
2,Stale,"well it's is about chi gung - and it is informative for the simple beginner. but the illustrations/pictures are not very good done. worth having as a part of the library, if you really have to. but otherwise not worth buying."
2,Don't need it,I have done two handfulls of stereo installations and always needed an installation kit. I assumed I needed one for my 04 forester X so I went ahead and ordered it. Found out aftermarket standard car stereos fit perfectly in the OEM stereo housing. SKIP on this product but DO purchase the wiring harness!
3,Soothe the screaming baby in the car!,"A friend sent me this cassette a few weeks after the birth of my daughter. She said it worked wonders on her baby for car rides, so it got popped in my tape deck the next time baby tweaked out on a drive. RELIEF!Do you really want to play this album as background music during your next dinner party? -- probably not, but the simple arrangements soothe baby and don't jangle parental nerves like so many other children's musical selections can. If you're looking for some peace and quiet on your next drive with junior, this is worth a shot!"
4,Interesting story,"I liked the plot a lot, which deserved a four star. But I did not quite care for the heroine, Mattie. While I thought she was portrayed as a innocent-orphan-turned-into-a-genteel duchess, her character was too weak and indecisive for my liking. Although she did grow into a more matured woman, but it was not until the last three pages of the book. I found I was getting frustrated with her forever ""fear of been ridiculed by the society"", and sincerely admired this ""quite-a-catch"" hero's patience and love for her, it was more than I thought of her--three stars there. But all in all, this was a decent book, I liked Ms. Wynn's other books better."
4,very good karaoke,"As I have found with almost all Party Tyme Karaoke products, this is a collection very good covers using real instruments. I'm only giving this 4 stars because I reserve 5 stars for original artist recordings which although rare, are available for some artists/songs."
5,Lovely scent,"I was very pleased with the scent. It is very lovely, long-lasting, addictive, and a little seductive. This is an excellent price and I will be buying again."
4,Cool and easy to raise.,I've had sea monkeys around five or six times during my life. I just recently bought some more and they are very easy to raise. It's fun to watch them grow from little tiny specs to big two inch long creatures. I would suggest this to anyone young or old!
3,SDL primer,"This book doesn't go very deep into game nor linux system programming. it's SDL primer and some mix of other libraries. It is good for you as a introduction to linux multimedia. SDL today is little bit different. Fe: there's nothing about SDL_Net. SDL is multiplatform and the author could pay more attention on this, it's shame."
3,It takes a lot of work to read this,"While it may be premature to review this book (I am still struggling through it)I can't help myself. The descriptions seem more a game of words than travel writing and I become distracted by the long, complex sentence structures. I have frequently lost track of what she is describing and had to return to the beginning of the sentence. While reading this book do not be tempted to let your mind wander a bit or you will become hopelessly lost! Some captioning would be nice for the illustrations. They are lovely but the reader is not entirely sure what(s)he is looking at. As yet, I have been unable to formulate a firm picture in my mind of places she is describing, except perhaps the chapter on the cats - it was marvelous! I may read this again at some time in the future; right now I just want to finish it and get on into something that isn't quite so much work!!"
1,not a novel,"this book is deceiving...i admit, some will find it interesting, but clark jumps around with no transitions. it is more of a journal, or a collection of essays. she does describe in detail a number of things in rome, yet if you are looking for a novel or a piece of literature which is cohesive this is not the book for you."
1,NOT USER FRIENDLY!,"I am using this textbook for my Math for Business and Economics class and it is terrible. This book is not written taking into consideration the audience ""Business Majors"". Concepts are better explained in the Chapter review than under the sections they are being presented. There is only 1 example for each new concept and definitions are written using one or two definitions of new concepts within it. If this book is intended to take the student from the abstract concept to the real world it sure doesn't do this. I understood the material better in my Intermediate Algebra class than I do now."
1,Lacking in going from abstract to application,"This review is for the 11th edition of the book. I am using this for a business math course and overall the book is lacking. Many of the examples presented in the chapters are simplistic and have no relation to the difficulty of the application examples. It's unfortunate that the solutions manual while containing the solutions to the examples does not go into more detail in how to solve these type of problems. While it appears the authors goal is to go from abstract to application, he misses the mark. I find myself consulting external resources for almost every chapter. Not recommended."
3,Math Book,"the description said it was never used but there was writing in it, edges of the pages ripped and the book wasn't shipped until the day after the deadline for me to receive it."
1,"Finite Mathematics for Business Economics, Life Sciences and Social Sciences (10th Edition)","They sent me the wrong book. I ordered the Finite Mathematics for Business Economics, Life Sciences and Social Sciences (10th Edition)by Raymond A. Barnett and received the solution manual. I feel very disapointed with this purchase."
2,Difficult to understand thoughts,I am taking a mathematics class using this book. The book is difficult to use as a reference or learning tool if you have not math oriented. The only reason why I am able to complete the problems is because I have a good instructor.
1,Not user friendly,"I am currently using this book for my college course. Examplesare not clear, and many steps missed. Per our instructor alot of the answers in the back are inaccurate. I do not recommend this book for students whom are not well versed in algebra"
3,"Finite Mathematics for Business, Economics, Life Sciences and Socail Sciences 11 edition","I found the book to be in very good condition, didn't hinder my use in the slightest bit. Good price compaired to what it was listed at other locations. Will be checking again, when I need another book for school or for personal reading."
5,Book purchase,The book was in excellent condition! Shipment was very quick. A great transaction and definitely would buy from again.
2,"Positive message, yet it contradicts itself.","Here we get to see Sean Young, as usual, with Patrick Bergin, give a bad performance. In this film Young plays a Georgia DA who tries to track sex maniac Bergin. The film promotes a good message, and what it's trying to say is that women are not mindless sex objects to be manipulated by men. However, this message got lost in the final edit of the film. Instead, it comes off as looking like a back alley soft-core flick, with endless scenes of female nudity and S&M poses, and spankings. Trust me, save your money and don't waste your time with this one."
3,The unrated version,"This was the review I wrote on ""Full Body Massage"": ""An unreal plot with senseless flashbacks, but Mimi Rogers' bod rules -- no question about it, so don't bother about her acting (or lack thereof)"". Well pretty much the same thing applies here. Only Sean Young is younger and slimmer. So make sure you got the unrated version."
3,not dvd,"Would have been a great movie had it came in DVD, VHS is so out dated, I use to think it was the best ever."
3,A dissenting voice,"Aldrich's thesis is that a Christian's life style will predispose the non-Christian to listen to this or her words and then, hopefully, they can be persuaded to accept Christ. This method of evangelism is different than confrontational evangelism where the Christian confronts another with the demands of the gospelStudies have shown that Life Style Evangelism just doesn't work. Thomas Rainer's book, Effective Evangelistic Churches, demonstrated that few of these churches use Aldrich's methodology. Why? Because it is too easy to be nice- in order for people to come to know Christ they must be confronted with the gospel. Rainer demonstrates it is not necessary to spend months, if not years, building relationship with people before we share the gospel. Nevertheless, it is not without value and would be a valuable addition to your library."
4,A bare-knuckled guide on how to keep your tenants in line.,"While Andy's prose may torture some, and his ethics offendothers, those who have actually been in the real estatebusiness will appreciate his hard-won practical advice.This is the kind of book my friend Ed, king of the smallbusiness seminars would love!"
4,Cant really ethically,"recommend as practical advice. Not sure because of the legalities. But read this for the humor! I couldnt put it down! Funny as can be. Could you use this advice? Oh yeah, if you dont mind a lawsuit or two, but the authors writing style make this a must read. Anyone who has ever owned rental real estate can appreciate this one. I want to read his ""Revenge"" on Landlord book if its as funny as this one."
3,Ruthless Rental Supervisor Reveals All,"If laughter is the best medicine then the rusty irony of Care and Feeding of Tenants will cure all.As someone who has rented or lived homeless since adulthood I laugh heartily while reading this comical landlord book.Remember : NATURE is the real landlord, the real property owner."
2,Candlesticks,they are much flimseyer than I expected - any slight movement tips them over so there will be no lit candles on these puppies - also I live in southern California where there are constant quakes and they have gone over even with movement I cannot feel - really disappointed
3,One Candleholder came dented,I was pretty dissapointed when I opened up my package and noticed that the base of one of the candleholders was dented.
3,"They hold candles, what else do you want?",They hold the candles so they pass the engineering test. What you see is what you get. There is little else to say; either you liek the design or you don't.
2,Spanish candleholder,"I love the appearance of the candleholders but in my opinion, these items are a fire hazard. I put a candle on and the holder toppled over. I tried the other holder and it happened as well. I wouldn't recommend this product."
4,Mom loves them!,"Mom likes them, seem to be great quality. Only problem is that they are heavy, so it may be expensive to ship. Still, much cheaper, even with shipping, than you will find them at your local store."
3,not sure why this is for long hair,"I did not notice any difference on the packaging to say ""long hair"" Hoping this one works as was described."
4,My new tool,"I am starting a diet and exercise, and this is my tool so as not to damage my hair since I will only be swimming because of my bad knees. I am happy with this cap...my hair only gets slightly moist but not wet at all. Thank you."
2,Don't keep hair dry,I thought it will keep my hair dry - but it didn't. The only pro is that it fits my waist length hair without hurting my head. But the water seeps in and makes my hair wet.
1,speedo swim cap,"This product is not made for long hair. I have shoulder length hair and I couldn't get it on my head at all! It was so thin and cheap feeling and once I got it on, I had to rip it off right away. It killed my head.... Not for me. Waste of money......"
3,"Comfortable, but does not keep hair dry","This cap is comfortable and it does not pull my hair, however, my hair gets fairly wet."
3,Swim cap's average,"The swim cap definitely works well with long hair. It doesn't keep you completely dry, but I have never come across a cap that has. It's not better than any other swim cap I've tried. It's not bad, but it's not superior."
4,Pretty good swim cap,"It's been years since I wore a swim cap, but I'm pleased with this one. The edges of my hair get wet, but not the bulk of it, which I put up in a ponytail and then cover with the cap. Doesn't pull my hair."
3,"Hair all fits, but doesn't stay dry","If you're looking for a cap that will hold pretty long hair, this might be the one for you. I found it spacious enough for mine (lots of below-shoulder hair), but it does NOT keep the water out. My hair wasn't as soaked as if I hadn't worn anything, but it was fairly wet, not just damp. I'd like to find one for long hair that has the ribs on the inside edges, which seem to keep out water better (like windshield wiper blades), but haven't found any in a cap that's large enough for my volume of hair."
5,Speedo swim cap,"I have very long and thick dreadlocks and could never find a swimcap that fits; this one is perfect. Covers all of my hair, isn't tight or uncomfortable and keeps the water out"
1,No different than the average cap,"I've been on the lookout for a good cap that offered better coverage for my medium length, thick hair. This really isn't it. It works as well as the average size, which is to say that it keeps about 75% of my hair dry. I'm not sure what qualifies this cap as ""long hair"" specific. Feels like it's on snugly, but doesn't do the job. I'm using it until I find something better."
5,Tight at First,Cap came as described. My hair is not very long and even for me the cap felt very tight the first few times that I put it on. After several uses I no longer have this problem. The cap now fits snugly without being too tight.
3,"It very, very, very tight on my head.","It does what it is supposed to do but it is very, very tight on my head. It hurts my head and I have to constently adjust it to get some relief. I find that it is difficult to get on. I hope that other people like this swimming cap and don't have any difficulty with it. Good luck!"
1,I hate it,"It was not a long hair cap and it is tight and uncomfortable.I have no intention to use it, I was just to disgusted to take the time and effort to return the items"
4,does the job,"it is big and tight and keeps her long hair dry.you have to be careful not to puncture it, but all good caps are like that"
3,It fits,This is a really easy to wear cap. My hair is long and i have no problem putting it on. I was hoping that it would keep my hair dry but it doesn. maybe im doing something wrong...
2,a head tournicate,"I have very long hair, so I thought this would be good. This cap gives me a headache rather quickly. My old cheap cap fit better and had more room for my hair, (but it disintegrated). This cap would definitely keep the water out, but it is just too tight and does not give extra room for extra hair."
5,bathing cap,My grandaughter is on a swim team and she got good use of the cap. She still has the cap
3,Sort of Fits...,"I bought this cap about a month ago. My hair is thick and down to my waist, and I have a pretty large head. If I braid my hair and/or put it in a bun at the base of my head, this cap fits. I could be wrong, but it's my understanding that no cap is really designed to keep all water out. This cap let's some water in but it's much better than swimming without a cap at all. My only complaint about this cap is that after 5-10 laps or so, about 50% of the time the cap will slowly start to slide up off my forehead. I wash my face and cap before every use, so I have no idea why this would happen. So, I'm constantly having to stop and take it off, dry my forehead and cap, put it back on, and continue swimming, which is annoying. The cap is smooth on the inside, so perhaps it would be improved with grooves or texture to keep it from possibly slipping. I'll give this 3 stars because it does fit, it's comfortable, it doesn't snag my hair, and it's still better than nothing."
2,Fits perfectly but leaks,"I can't figure out why this cap leaks. It fits PERFECTLY yet my hair is nearly soaked after half an hour of swimming laps. PROS: no snagging, long thick hair fits in cap, quality material, fits great CONS: leaks"
4,Speedo Silicone for Long Hair a Must,"After declaring a new start from my sedentary lifestyle, I realize that returning to the gym for swims will be more agreeable than running on a treadmill. I have long hair and anyone knows that chlorine wrecks havoc on it after a considerable time exposed to this element. Plus, I just want to run out from the gym when I'm done.Overall, the cap is able to hold my hair securely and no major leakage seeping inside the cap. I felt like an alien but hey, working out in a public pool you want to make sure your hair is secured. I recommend this product to anyone with hair that reaches to mid-back or longer. Just make sure to tie it into a ponytail and wrap it into a bun and you can add powder (I prefer not to b/c I don't want to look like Marie Antoinette) and happy swimming."
4,Sturdy Swimcap,"Though the cap does not keep my hair completely dry, it works better than any other cap I've ever used. Twisting my very long, thick hair into a high bun, then pulling on the cap, my ears are still covered and just my hairline (all around) gets wet; the bulk of my hair stays dry. This is after swimming any stroke for a 45 minute work out. I haven't tried diving to the bottom of the pool, yet. The silicone material seems thicker than any other silicon cap I've owned and should last a long time. Fair price, too."
4,Swim Cap does the tric,"This very basic swim cap does the trick. It keeps out water, while not falling off or pulling on your hair."
3,Bought for my granddaughter swim class,"Didn't keep,her hair dry enough in swim class. Time to shower and shampoo before the bell rings isn't possible for her....it didn't keep her hair dry, but it did keep her hair from turning green from the chlorine and her hair dye color..."
2,Why even wear the cap?,"I needed a cap to keep my hair dry while I lap swim, and to also fit my long hair. I bought two of these, one in white and one in black. I have worn the black three times and each time when I take the cap off my hair is as wet as if I had never worn the cap. What is the point of the cap if it doesn't keep your hair dry? All my hair does fit into the cap, comfortably. Many of the cheaper silicone caps keep my hair perfectly dry but break after 2-3 uses because they can't take the amount of hair I have. I would really like to find a good cap, still on the lookout, comment if you can recommend a good one."
5,Great!! Great!! Great!!,"I've had a few caps recently that claimed to be for long hair. They did not work well and wicked up water something terrible. I found this cap to be extremely easy to get on and get my hair in and as long as you know how to get your cap on, you will not end up with wet hair as other reviewers have stated.My hair is very long, and I have a larger head to begin with. This cap is easy for me to get on and off. Since my hair is below my lower back I gather it up first and twist it into a bun low on my head. Then I use a single small hair tie top secure it. I pull open the cap grab the bun area first and pull around and over. Then simply adjust it a little.Works super great! Does not tear or pull my hair! Awesome thank you speedo!!"
5,long hair swim cap,my daughter has waist-long very thick hair and is still using the cap for her second season works great
1,I guess this is for kids,"'Too small' is my first word.My head is kinda big, plus long hair. I tried really hard to put this cap on and there is no way I could put it. The rim kept rolling itself and the cap slip off my head."
3,Does not fit long hair,"When Speedo was describing this as a cap for long hair, I wonder what length they had in mind. This does not fit long hair. Infact I have shoulder lenght hair and its hard to fit that as well. The cap is good and sturdy but does not do what it's described to do."
3,Easy to use but does not keep hair dry,"My hair might not be long enough to fill it up (shoulder length--I put it in a ponytail first), but I swam with it and ended up with a big pocket of air/water on the top. With readjustment, the pocket went away but my hair was likely still getting wet. But it's fine for the most part--I'll keep wearing it but will experiment with regular caps as well."
4,good quality,It's pretty elastic. It does hold a lot of hair in my case. My swim glasses got a little slippery laying over it though.
2,Hair gets wet with this cap,"This swim cap covers my hair but doesn't keep out the water. I wish I had known this *before* I bought it. There has to be a better option for long-haired swimmers. I have *very* thick, chest-length hair. I have highlights that would turn green pretty quickly if I kept using this. I even tried putting a shower cap on under it to see if that might help, but it didn't work."
2,Won't stay put,Advertised for longer hair and it does cover my head but it slips up with movement. Constantly pulling on it. Maybe it will stretch with use but I decided to order another latex cap to give that a try.
3,Good quality but doesn't keep my hair dry,"This is a good quality cap that is very durable and keeps my hair up, however, when I'm done with my swim, my hair is usually a bit wet anyways. So if you want your hair to stay really dry, this isn't the cap for you."
2,wet hair,"The cap is big enough to hold my long hair but it doesn't keep it dry, my hair is as wet af if I wore no cap at all.It also like to ride up over the ears."
3,"Nice, but didn't really do the trick for my purpose","I read other reviews before I purchased the swim cap, and hoped it would keep my hair mostly dry. It got too wet for my liking. I used it once and set it aside. If you don't mind having wet hair, it's just fine."
2,Not large enough for my long hair,"Cannot find a swim cap that holds my hair. This is not it. Tried this on and it popped off my head! Gave it to a friend with equally long hair, but not as thick, and she likes it. She uses it for competitive swimming.If you have long and thick hair, this is not going to work. If you have long, thin hair, it might."
4,Cap covers long hair well,"This cap covers my hair well. Like other caps though, it wears out from the chlorine. In my opinion, it runs a little large."
3,Doesn't keep hair dry,"Didn't keep my hair dry at all, but did keep it out of my face. Hard to put on, but aren't they all? Since I don't do competition, I prefer a Lycra cap. Less painful and less likely to go flying when you try to put it on."
1,not the best quality,"i was fooled by the good reviews posted on this website, i had 2 silicone swimcaps and they both broke after i used them once or twice. finally i got the latex one from another company, it's much better and i don't get my hair wet at all"
1,This Item was not received,I am very disappointed because I never received the Speedo Silicone Long Hair Swim Cap (silver). It was not left of my door step and I have no Idea where it went.
3,"is okay, does the job","It kept my air dry which is the main thing. But it was pretty tight on my head and I have a pretty small head. Also, I have long hair, (not think) and I dont see how the ""extra space"" is really needed. It just had a lot of extra room that was bumpy and makes me look kinda like a cone head. I think a regular one would do just fine for my long hair."
2,Won't keep your hair dry,This swim cap is not going to keep your hair dry so if you're buying it with the intent of avoiding damage to your hair--think again.
5,Swim,I like this rating because long hair is rare anyway and I think the highest rating explains the safety it takes to swim and take care of hair in chlorine.
1,Disappointed,I bought it to protect my daughter's hair from the water/chlorine. It fit great but her hair still got wet!
3,swimming cap review,"This swim cap may have worked well, but my daughter (who it was bought for) never really put it on right, and then after wearing it 6 or 7 times, tried to see how much water it would hold, and it broke. Not sure it I would try it again..."
5,Finally found a good swim cap,Excellent product. It was difficult to find a swim cap. Thank you Amazon for offering one.
1,Didn't Fit Really Long Hair,I bought this for my wife; who is a casual swimmer. Her hair goes to about her mid-back and this cap was much too small for her. We were both disappointed. I guess by long hair they mean shoulder length hair.
2,TOO SMALL!,"I read the reviews on this cap and decided to give it a try. I have very thick hair and apparently my head is too big! While there might have been enough room for hair, having this cap on was like having a vice on your head. I could not stand it for more than 30 seconds. I know I am not petite, but there are plenty of people with different size heads. I went to return it, but Amazon said ""hey you are a good customer, this one is on us!"" Apparently they are going to credit me. I am still on the hunt for a proper swim cap that will fit my head.Sorry Speedo,this was an epic fail for me."
3,Works pretty good,"I have long (below shoulder length), thick hair. I swim all summer in my home pool and bought this to prevent damage to my hair. It works pretty good. Although I usually need assistance getting it on and it is pretty tight, it does keep my hair mostly dry -- although the ends still get wet."
2,Cap holds hair in side it well,"I bought this cap to keep my long bleached blonde hair from getting wet or turning green. My hair still gets wet, but has not turned green. An instructor recommended to put conditioner on my hair before putting on the cap to keep it from turning green. I have not needed to do that yet. It holds my long hair inside the cap well."
3,Speedo Cap,When i read about the product i thought this would be a good cap to protect my hair. my hair's length is long like below the waist line and it's thick too. the best part about it is that when you adjust your hair to fit into the cap it fits well. but the only problem i had with this cap was that when i dive into the water i think the water would seep in the back part of the cap and make it wet. It didn't wet my whole hair but just the back part of it. this cap fits well too. It doesn't like constict your head and stop the blood flow to your brain.
3,Not big enough,"Material is great, but the cap could be a bit bigger. One size fits all often means some will be fit too tight."
3,Cool but not functional for me,"I tried this shoulder rest out and chose the Kun Bravo instead. While the adjustments feature on the Voce is innovative for the violin, the Bravo was a better physical fit for me over the Voce. I did not notice any significant difference in sound properties between the two shoulder rests."
3,Not ergonomic for me,"I give this device two stars not because its bad, but because if you have wide shoulders and short neck, as I do, it won't fit you. This shoulder rest works good for people with middle to long necks, otherwise try regular Kun shoulder rest."
4,Almost Flawless,"I love using this on my acoustic electric, it actually makes it louder. The difference is definitely noticeable when amplified. Also if the shoulder rest is not snug, it won't produce a more resonant sound on your violin. I mention this because the difference is vast when playing amplified. It's very light weight and compliments my carbon fiber weave chin rest quite well.However in terms of ergonomics it took me a good 2 weeks to fine tune adjustments to make it actually comfortable. Fortunately this particular shoulder rest is versatile in adjustments.Anyone who is using an under-bridge pickup such asThe Realist Acoustic Violin Transducer 1/4 inch plug(which I use), this shoulder rest will counter the dampened effect of the bridge resting on the pickup to a certain extent.I highly recommend to any acoustic electric players. You will notice the difference. And even if you are just playing acoustic it's great."
4,Crazy Jerry plays it 'straight'.,"Well, you either love or hate Mr. Lewis! His attempt to play a straight role, even one originated by his idol Al Jolson, was a daring attempt to be serious, if only for a less-than-an hour TV production. The supporting cast (including Molly Picon, Alan Reed)is very strong and Jerry obviously relishes the role.Had the piece ran for another half-hour it possibly would have had more impact and be less abrupt. The picture and sound quality are very acceptable, considering the source, though why we need a b/w version too, other than to pad-out the playing time, I don't know.It is still a 'must' for us Jerry fanatics!"
2,Disappointing,This movie was not what we expected and it ended too abruptly. It was more a group of Jerry Lewis show segments patched together than a movie.
5,Found Hard to find Information on Weights of NA Birds,This out-of-print booklet is really helpful to anyone caring for birds because it tells you what they should weigh and divides wts by sex. It tells you whether the birds were weighed in the south (will be lighter in wt) or in the north. I was glad to find this publication. Thanks!
2,"Put some clothes on, people!","We bought this as a fun activity for us to enjoy as a married couple, but, just as a warning, it is filled with pictures of naked people--even some full frontal nudity. I recognize this won't bother some people like it did us, but, we wanted to make sure people were aware before they bought it. If we had known, we wouldn't have bought it. If you want to learn massage but don't want to see naked people, I recommend Susan Mumford's bookThe New Complete Guide to Massage. It has minimal nudity and none of it is frontal."
2,A bit over the top,I thought it would be great to have a set of cards to give massage instruction but I thought most of the cards were too intrested in the sexual side of massage rather than the healing benefits. I sent it back.
5,Great toy. Definitely for young children 3& under.,"Very nice counting & color set. I think my little man out grew this but i still you use it in different ways to challenge him. Will be great for the baby in a few months. But I have to add that my 6yo likes them, loves sorting."
4,Informative and Understandable,"A very informative book that covers many aspects of heart disease including causes and prevention. Vocabulary is appropriate for the target audience. The inclusion of a glossary, index, and web links enhance the effectiveness of this book. The only drawback is the lack of a pronounciation guide for the technical term used in the book. Other than that this is an excellent choice for anyone who needs or wants more information on this topic."
3,Outdated,"The edition that I mistakenly ordered was published in 1995 and is outdated with regard to diagnostics and treatments of heart disease. My fourth grader used this as reference for our homeschool unit study on the human heart. The information presented is easy to understand and serves the purpose of learning the basic principles of heart disease. The beginning of the book introduces Dennis Dutremble and his experience having a heart attack. The rest of the book discusses the anatomy of the heart, how it works, types and causes of heart disease, diagnosis, and treatment of the disease. It is written in a format that 4th through 6th graders can easily grasp, but as a nurse myself, the book is better intended as an informational reference for newly diagnosed patients. Decent book for the basics, but make sure you pay attention to the publishing date and order the edition that is most current."
4,THIS ALBUM IS PHAT MANY FREESTYLE CLASSICS,THIS CD IS WORTH BUYING IT HAS THE BEST FREESTYLE SONG EVER DREAMBOY/DREAMGIRL BY THA HOTTIE MY FAVORITE CYNTHIA ALSO FEATURES THE GREATEST MALE VOCALE JOHNNY O .P.S.

2,Disappointed!,"My 3-year old son was delighted to get the jumpster for Christmas, but the excitement didn't last very long. He used it twice, and a seam blew out completely. No patch kit could repair it. Contacted the manufacturer, and still haven't heard a response from them yet."
1,Not long lasting & is not safe,"This only lasted a few times days for us. There were so many leaks, it wasn't worth patching. The bouncy tipped over quite a few times. Luckily no one was hurt. What a waste of money."
2,fun but does not last,"My 2 1/2 year old and 4 year old received this for Christmas (this was our second attempt). They loved and and although we adheared to the weight limit within 4 days we had 3 holes in it. The first hole was one whole section on the side (so they kept on playing) but the second hole, both in a seam, was in the top section so it would not stay up. The last hole was in the base of the unit so we had to throw it away. The first one we bought last year I had inadvertantly created a hole in it so we thought we would try again. We will not be buying another one. If you get it at a great price and want it for a weekend (child's party) it is good but not something that stands up to daily use."
3,Jumpster,"My kids enjoy the jumpster very much, but it deflates on one side quite frequently---there are no holes or scratches, just does not seem to hold up--we just inflate it every week or two."
2,Disappointed,"I gave this to my grandson for Christmas. He only got to use it twice but loved it. The problem is that the material is not very durable. They set it up inside but it soon got punctures and can't be used because it leaks. I would not buy from this manufacturer again. I guess we got what we paid for. We're going to buy another one, but from Little Tykes this time. Hopefully we'll have better luck."
3,the girls do it for me,saw them live in london feb 07 if that had been captured here I would have given 5/5 seems that Kashmir as it always did and will captures the true magic of the zep
3,very simple text,"I needed some books about kites for a lesson... this is a very simple story, good for young children."
3,barebones,"I didn't like what I saw when I found this map in the bookstore. This map is very basic, containing 5 maps of lower manhattan up to 8th st. Each map is basically a colorful barebones street grid with not much else. There is a separate nyc subway mini map, and an index of major landmarks listed. The pros of this map is that it is laminated on heavy cardstock, and it folds up quickly. You can do better by printing your own map of Manhattan with what you want on it rather than staring at a barebones map with almost nothing on it. It is recommended you go with Berndtson & Berndtson manhattan map. It is similar, laminated, but containg much more info."
2,Not a keeper,"I would check this out from a library, but it isn't one to buy. It has a lot of neat recipes, but not as many activities for room mothers as I expected. This is more creative cooking ideas than anything else. Not what I was looking for. I returned it."
2,Chapulin Unjustice!!!,"Everybody talk about the greatness of El Chapulin Colorado, and i couldnt agree more on that.But this DVD is almoust a rip off!Somebody writed on his review ""Image and sound totally re-mastered"". WHAT!?The image quality nor the sound quality are remastered.Shame on the peolple behind this.I am so disapointed. :("
5,EL MEJOR VOLUMEN DEL CHAPULIN COLORADO!!!!!,"Los episodios son:* La bruja Maratuja* El pirata del asteroide.* Al robot le falta un tornillo.* Cabeza atorada.* El actor debutante/La pobrecita doncellita.* Una bomba para el Tio Moncho.Yo diria que los mejores episodios son La Bruja Maratuja, El pirata del asteroide, La pobrecita doncellita y Una bomba para el Tio Moncho. Todos los episodios son graciosos pero me gustó mucho La pobrecita doncellita porque es el único episodio que tiene MUCHA ACCION!!!!!!!!P.S: La razon de que este volumen es el mejor del Chapulin Colorado es porque Maria Antonieta actua en dos episodios los cuales la ponen BIEN BUENA de cuerpo y belleza en estos episodios!!!!!!!!Adios."
3,Movie Fun,"This is a fun game for the kids that requires the inexpensive dance pad that has all of the same buttons as a hand-held controller. It is a great way to teach coordination and get the kids to exercise during wet or cold weather. It is the same few songs over and over which is great for even small children, but gets on my nerves as an adult, so cordless headphones come in really handy after the first few plays."
2,Disappointing,"Unfortunately, I agree with the previous reviewers. This book is more about ""Mexico Mike"" than Mexico. All writer's have biases, but his obscure the facts. It sounds like he has money invested in the resort at El Paraiso. It also sounds like he is a recovering alcoholic. There is some good information in this book, but nothing that can't be found in other, better books. (People's Guide to Mexico, for instance)"
5,Live better south of the border in Mexico,"This is a very helpful book. Practical info, while slightly out of date, one can figure out what you need to."
1,"Lousy book, more about the author than Mexico","The author has a lot of axes to grind and uses a book about Mexico as an excuse to grind them. He hates life in the USA, (""harsh winters, the crime and constant living in fear or merely of the constant sameness that deadens our souls... a seige mentality that affects so many of us... get away from boring neighbors who are afraid to take any chances in life."") That's his blanket condemnation of all life in the USA, so I'm not quite trusting in his impression of Mexico. He hates his dad, tells you at length about what a jerk he was, which by this point was telling me that this wasn't really a book about Mexico. But if you want to know the rules of drinking in Mexico (he reassures you that the racist idea that ""it is a shooting offense to refuse a drink offered by a Mexican"" is false.. whew, what a relief!) or where to go when you want to stop drinking, this is the book..."
3,"Good book, not right time","Please, if you are moving to Mexico just to take advantage of cheaper costs...Reality might hit you in the face. Also, there is still a lot of prejudices against Americans. The book does a good job in describing the conditions of living and the infrastructure, but don't get too excited about actually living there and building a sustainable investment. The way the laws are set up do not favor foreigners. The best advice: stay in America"
3,Live Better South of the Border,"Usefull information about living and traveling in Mexico,entertaining and informative"
1,This book stinks,"If anyone was thinking of moving to mexico, unless you were homeless, this book is dispicable. What a downer."
4,An excellent overview book-- exactly as intended,"This book isn't intended to cover the entire country of Mexico in-depth, in great detail. It's an overview! And it does a fine job of that. I find myself wondering why it seems to turn off so many people just because the author gives details about English-speaking AA or gay-friendliness? This is good to know, even if you're not gay or an AA member, as it's an indirect indicator of how tolerant the city is of transplants. If just reading this info turns you off, how will you deal with the differences in culture that come with living in Mexico? This is a great overview book, but naturally you will need more info to make your decision to move or not."
4,This entertaining read contained insight and perspective.,"Not only was it informative, the book was an enjoyable and easy read. Devoid of the usual ""data overload"" of its genre. Written devoutly from the male perspective. Woman may not find Mr. Nelson as engaging as male readers. That theory may explain the hostile review included in this review section."
2,50 pages of good...forget the rest,The first 50 pages were informational and well written. After that it became only a list of towns with scant information. HEAVY emphasis on AA and ALANON throughout the book. Rather assumes every visitor to Mexico is in need of an AA meeting in every town.
2,Where's the mystery?,"I agree with another reviewer that the title should have indicated crime stories rather than mysteries. There was never any mystery about who had done it. Also, the vast majority of the stories seemed aimed at a male audience. I got pretty tired of descriptions of fights and near fights and thugs and guns.If I remember correctly, only one story seemed aimed at a female audience and was also the only one read by a female."
3,Pick and Choose,"This anthology of ""Mystery"" stories is a puzzling mix of genuine mysteries and several other stories that belong to other genres, as other reviewers have pointed out. Many of them would be better categorized as short dramas or action thrillers. A good chunk of the stories also are unnecessarily lewd in a way that serves no useful purpose in the story. I did, however, enjoy several of the stories, and found some to be rather humorous. Not all the ones I enjoyed fit my understanding of mystery, for example, the ""Championship of Nowhere"" and the ""Mule Rustlers"" were good non-mystery fiction. Basically this collection is not what you might expect or hope for, but it does have several redeeming stories."
2,Another dud,"What is Mr. Penzler thinking? This is the second year in a row that he has chosen inferior mystery fiction as the ""best"". Although this book is a slight improvement over last year's, which isn't saying much, as a mystery fan and reader, I expect more. And what's most troubling is that I know there are far better stories out there. This anthology, like last year's stinker, is tedious and baffling. I'm beginning to wonder if Mr. Penzler has some ulterior motives in his selection process. Whatever his motivation, it certainly isn't selecting the ""best"" that mystery fiction has to offer.Don't let editors get away with selecting just anything as the best. Please, punish Mr. Penzler for his editorial crimes and skip this book."
1,This Is By Far The Worst Headphones I Ever Bought!,"I had these since Monday and today is Saturday. These headphones already cracked and its not from rough handling, it's from just being in my pocket. I am very upset with my order and I am pretty sure you would be too. It is badly made and it's super uncomfortable. I feel like it's trying to stretch my ear when I use it. Also my right headphone will not work as loud as my left. There is something definitely wrong with these. I hate them."
1,Terrible product,"Not worth the money. The chord is too short, making it impossible to use with your Ipod if your taller than 5'8''."
2,Yet another book that doesn't get it!,"Let me start by saying that I enjoy reading cookbooks as much as I enjoy using them, and from the first read, I am not very impressed. I really wanted a vegetarian grilling book, what I got was a book that calls for chicken stock in at least one recipe, tells me what kind of meat I could throw in to the mix and tells me that I won't even miss the meat. While there may be pros and cons to the cheese question, how can anyone justify chicken broth in a vegetarian cook book?"
2,"Funny, but use of 'N' word offensive","Inspector Lestrade, along with his Sergeant George George must track down a killer who bludgens his victims all over England and Wales, selects only bad people, and is described in a number of ways. Sherlock Holmes and Watson get in the way with Watson being every bit the incompetent Doyle made him out, but with Holmes being cruel in his own supposed intelligence.This is a very funny book. Full of puns, cockney-accented discussions of the meaning of the dialectic and the coming revolution, police incompetence, and British bungling, it will make you laugh out loud. The final sequence, involving a number of police in black-face and frequent use of the 'N' word was intended to be funny. I found it offensive and dropped my rating as a result."
2,NSA 2832 starter,"The quality of this product is questionable . The starter has a very high pitch when in use , did not disengage completely."
5,A Great Compass for my Geometry Students,"After making due with the compasses available from our local office supply stores, I finally bit the bullet, spent a few dollars and got the real deal. I'm in my second year of teaching geometry and absolutely love this thing! While it hasn't taken all the pain out of geometry, the constructions are quicker, easier, neater, and more accurate."
3,Another book for the Hemingway collection,I have many books on Hemingway and find him an interesting individual. My two latest addition are this cookbook and one of his cocktails he enjoyed. I do think this is an unusual book as is the one on cocktails. Not everyone would enjoy this read if they were not a Hemingway fan.
5,Delicious and informative!,"I admit to being an avid--some say rabid--Hemingway fan. I ordered the book with no expectations other than to have another Hemingway collectable. I was pleasantly thrilled to find anecdotes, history of Hem, as well as really good and fun recipes. I have an annual Hemingway party on July 21 and cooked the trout for 20 last year. It was wonderful! Highly recommend for both the food and the text. Really really great!"
5,Goob book,The book is useful for those who begin studying CFD methods in heat transfer and fluid flows. It has been a standard for several years.
5,"Great book, very helpful",I read this book years ago and loved it! A very helpful book...will make you laugh as well.
3,"Scholarly and definitive, but tedious","MRS. ASTOR'S NEW YORK deservedly will become the definitive work regarding the City of New York and, specifically, its upper class, during that period of the 19th Century known as the ""Gilded Age.""As such, this book is as much about the evolution of the modern city as it is about the robber barons who shaped the era. The research is impeccable and almost ponderously thorough.The title, however, is somewhat misleading, as the volume is does not focus on Mrs. Astor individually but, rather, on what she meant to her contemporaries in terms of being a symbol and an inspiration as to how one should live.Eric Homberger is an excellent writer. Yet the mass of information he presents, albeit significant, is too tedious to make for an entertaining read. As a work of historical record, however, MRS. ASTOR'S NEW YORK is invaluable."
1,Very Disappointing & Frustrating,"I've been reading about the Gilded Age and turned to this book with great expectations that have been dashed. How could the editor have let the book go through as it is? Yes, it's a beautiful package and well-enough written (though hardly an Edith Wharton novel as one reviewer said, as quoted on the back cover). The book's title is completely deceptive. A good third of the book is not about the Gilded Age at all, but goes back to the 1800-1850 period and sometimes in tedious detail. It does not help me at all to know the customs involved in women making calls upon other women in 1800 when those customs had changed by the late 19th century. While one can make a case that the roots of the Gilded Age need to be exposed, you don't have to go that far back and into that much detail. The First Four Hundred, which this author sneers at in a footnote, is far more focused and helpful, and a much better source of information, though this book's opening chapter was fascinating."
5,"Das Dental Labor, a must read for dental technicians","A great magazine to keep you updated on the European world of dental technology. wonderful photography and interesting articles. Only downside, it's quite expensive. I give it 5 stars!"
2,2005 published book that lacks depth,"This book was published in 2005. Consequently it suffers from lack of first hand sources. It is mainly a rehash of other works, written in a Reader's Digest ""Drama in Real Life"" way, that detracts from the historical significance.Very poorly written and I do not recommend it. I recommend the other accounts of this battle published in the 1950's whose authors could talk extensively with the principal players in the battle."
1,Very disappointing,"A painful reading experience, unless perhaps you've been there or a relative of yours has been there. But I doubt it. The author is constantly adding uninteresting and really boring details that drive your attention from the bigger picture - one that I've found difficult to grasp. The style is incredibly light for a History book. Very disappointing."
2,Important Battle Story Marred by Poor Writing,"This book is sadly deficient in writing quality, a fact that is perhaps more apparent to me right now because I've just finished reading two other World War II histories, both superbly written: ""Shattered Sword: The Untold Story of the Battle of Midway,"" and ""Flags of Our Fathers,"" about the six Marines who raised the flag at Iwo Jima. While the factual material here is worthwhile, you'll have to wade through considerable cliched verbiage to get to it. I'm gritting my teeth and doing it so far, but it's not an enjoyable effort. You might want to try a different book on this subject."
2,Historical play by play,"While the author provides us with some interesting new information about this action, it is presented like a sports announcer's play by play. If you like sound bites, you will love this book. Some might appreciate the frequent use of naval slang; but the constant reference to the graduation class of every naval officer mentioned, no matter how briefly, is annoying and distracting."
1,I could not finish this book.,"It read like an accident report. It had too many details of which pilot did what, with what, to whom. There were many phrases that were not explained enough for the less informed reader. I was looking more for the theory of the battle, rather than how many bullets plane A shot into plane B before it crashed. I made it two-thirds of the way through the book and gave up."
3,difficult to read,"i agree with all the 1-2 star reviews: this is not a well-written book, and the jingoism makes me cringe, sort of like watching borat. 3 stars, because it is oddly engaging, and indeed rich in facts."
2,History? Or Traffic Report?,Amazon presented an interesting juxtaposition by offering this book and Shattered Sword together. The latter is serious history. Clash of the Carriers seems to be lightweight vignettes in comparison. Tillman is obviously not a historian. His trying to count each kill by each American pilot doesn't count as history. Maybe as traffic or weather reporting.
2,Decent story ruined by author's biases.,"This is an adequate description of the famous battle; especially interesting is the story of the aftermath - all the pilots trying to get back to their ships. The author's obvious status as a Navy groupie, however, leads him to make silly and undocumented statements that detract mightily from his book. Two examples of throwaway lines will suffice - ""Harry Truman was the most anti-navy president of the twentieth century"", thus maligning a president who tried to end rivalries and bring some order to our defense establishment by making it sound as if he was ""against"" the navy. The second example refers to the Tailhook ""withhunt"", as if there were not legitimate reasons to discipline those yahoos. The index is totally inadequate (the words Truman and tailhook are not to be found). There must be better histories of the Marianas battle available."
2,Macho man,"This book was written by Barret Tillman with a short forward by Coonts. Tillman has a writing style that makes him seem like he's trying to be a macho literary. He uses phrases like ""on the morrow"" in an attempt to add drama but it ends up sounding lame. The way he puts things seem to trivialize the sacrifices on both sides. He wrote that some Japanese pilots were spared the trouble of a return flight. Oooh... clever!If you can get past Tillman's style, it's a good story but it has been better told within other books. If I remember correctly, both Clash of Titans and Clash of Wings cover this action pretty thoroughly and without the lame writing style and title stealing."
2,Planes have two wings for balance,"This book covers all the basics of a little-known but important battle, but it fails to take the reader beyond the facts and provide a useful interpretation. This is a two-dimensional nuts and bolts popular history for those fascinated by WWII aircraft. The prose is over-wrought and unashamedly politically partisan, which may be OK for an American audience, but undoubtedly will only serve to confuse foreign readers. This is especially apparent in Stephen Coonts foreward, which verges on jingoism. In many ways this book informs us more about the world view of 21st century American warhawks than about World War II. In sum, Tillman's politically partisan approach forgets a fundamental fact of aviation: carrier aircraft have two wings for balance, not just a right wing."
4,A great collection,"The album's tracks follow a chronological listing of the bands songs. The booklet is huge and contains lyrics translated in Japanese, as well as the original. It also has a timeline that goes until the end of 98."
4,"Great!NOt the best, but still excellent!","These are excellent speakers, they sound great!better than my old standard high quality black harmon/kardon with out bass speaker system sounded!These are great speakers, without a doubt.Love em.Never dissed them.And is great quality for any apllication on your computer.I reccomend then for anyone who has a computer or stereo or electronic that will fit with these speakers.*:)"
3,INSPIRED?,I have had this system for over 5 yrs. The sound is very good. Not sure how long they were supposed to last though. The fuse blowed and I have replaced it 4 times to no avail. Guess that I will have to say goodbye to this one and look for a new set. :(
3,"Interesting, but only useful if you have a Ph.D. or JD","Certainly this book gives some pertinent advice for linguists hoping to make some side money as expert witnesses, but it's a very niche market. I bought this as I was finishing up my bachelor's in linguistics to sort of figure out a way to make use of my degree. Ultimately this book wound up giving me the inspiration to go to law school. Whether that was a good choice... is still debatable."
5,"Safe, Works Well, Great Price",We live on a farm and have 8 cats. I've used Hartz Ultra Guard Reflecting Flea & Tick Collars on our cats for many years. They work well for the heavily wooded area we live in and zero of my cats have ever had any kind of bad reaction to the collars. And they are reasonably priced and last 7 months through the whole flea and tick season.
1,Do Not Buy Any Product from HARTZ Comapny!!!!!!!,"I recently bought this collar for my cat, and he almost died because of it. Whatever is in that collar is so strong that it hurt my cat's nervous system. About 2 hours after I placed the collar around his neck he started to foam at his mouth and shake uncontrollably. It looked like an epileptic attack. The vet confirmed that the seizures were caused by the chemicals in the collar and that he's not sure if my cat is going to make it.........Please if you care about your pets, don't let them suffer and don't buy anything from this company.Check this company's reviews!!!! They're not good."
1,Gave my cat a seizure.,"I bought this product from a local pet store. We were having flea issues and thought this might help, since our cat likes to go outside. About 3 hours after we put the collar on her, she lied down on the couch and didn't get back up for almost 20 hours. She became very aggressive and hostile toward our kittens (which she has never done)and would not allow anyone to touch her (which she is normally very cuddly). Finally, she had a seizure and we called the vet. He informed us that we needed to take the collar off (which we did) and within 5 minutes she was up and running around. I will never put a flea collar on her again. I spoke to a friend about the situation, and she had the same experience with her dogs with this brand!"
2,"Over the top, politically.","I liked Sonny the Bolo. Sonny might have been the most human character in the book, beside his drunken mechanic. Most of the other characters were over the top, whether because they were forced to be by the unbelievable chains of political events, or because they were the architects of those unbelievable events.If you like to see political premise carried to an extreme that is unlikely in any human society you'll enjoy this. My suspended disbelief was actually expelled halfway through and I found myself skipping over the more political bits.The politics were just too much to be believed or stomached."
2,Low on Hellbores...high on political intrigue,"This was one of the weaker novels I have read...and I have read everything written in the Bolo series. The 1st and last quarter of the book has good battle scenes and descriptions. The rest was character development, personal interactions between characters, and the political turmoil created on the planet. I skipped many pages just to get through the novel. If you are a diehard Bolo fan, than add this novel to your collection. For the casual reader who bought this book because of the authors' reputations..I would skip it. This collaboration just didn't gel."
3,Way too Looooooong,"I've enjoyed Ringo's other books, but Evans is new to me. I doubt I'll read another of hers after this. It seemed that the editor on this piece was just way too shy, or had little support from management. What this novel needed was a heck of a lot of cutting. It didn't help that many quotation marks were missing from ends and beginnings of paragraphs. Perhaps the editor was imaginary? On to the story. The basic story was good - I liked Sonny, and all of the human folks. Where it all went wrong was in the political BS. Perhaps I'm a Pollyanna, but the bad guys just seemed too unbelievable to be true. Surely they couldn't possibly be THAT stupid?! In the end, this book preached to me even more than a Terry Goodkind novel, which frankly, I thought impossible. Message to the authors: If we can wade through this schlock, you're already preaching to the choir. Any dissident wouldn't have been able to finish."
5,An allegory for today,"The authors have captured the zeitgeist of our current Federal Administration and its supporters of Occupy Wall Street. It is as if, years ahead of the 2012 elections they wrote a book that so mirrors current events as to be a little scary. They trace every politically correct decision to its inevitable bad result as one facet of society after another is corrupted or destroyed.If your are looking for a Bolo fluff shoot-em-up this is not your book but if you are interested in seeing how Keith Laumer would write about today's events this is your book. It is definitely in the tradition of his Retief series or his classic ""Earth Blood"". It is an interesting read well worth the effort."
3,Meh.,"A few things were good with the book. The epiphany at the end was very interesting. Sonny was a pretty decent Bolo character, the only other character that was any good was the Bolo Tech who was introduced towards the middle of the book. Then there were some really good battle scenes scattered throughout the book.Otherwise the characters operated at extremes. The mother was a tough sacrificing women who forged a planetary guerilla movement. The daughter goes from being a brainwashed brat from the pits of hell to a noble, tough and strong young woman. The Father is the stereotypical noble soldier who has seen far to much war and bloodshed. The evil government follows this same principle as being way over the top. The list goes on.If you can ignore the worst points about this book in can be ok."
1,Not able to use it as described.,This is obviously for a different heart rate monitor than the one I have. I spent a couple of hours trying to figure it out before just buying a new one.
5,Great replacement,"I needed a new strap, and this is even better than the original. Fits great, good value. I would recommend this to anyone"
5,Great product,"Very good product, I needed something fast and it was there. Works very well outstanding product. Will buy same to product if it needs to be replaced."
3,"Just the strap, not the monitor","While the title does describe the product fairly accurately, the picture is misleading and the product listing does not explicitly say that this is for the strap and the strap only. The section including the monitor is not included."
1,not worth buying,Probably the worst phrasebook available. Do not waste your money or time on this book.
3,"I like it, but something's a little off...","I love the Greyboy Allstars and follow the individual musicians as they have come into their own. Robert Walter is finding a niche, and it's a pretty nice one, but this disc isn't quite there yet. It doesn't have the drive of Soulive or the unbridled funk of Stanton Moore, I would recommend those before this disk. It's a little restrained to me."
1,Are you kidding me? $99 for this toy???,"I am just shocked that a ""company"" is trying to sell this Fisherprice toy for $99.00! Amazon should better monitor this type of pricing on products that surely are worth a lot less! Crazy!"
5,Great toy!,"My 2.5 year old twin boys love this toy! I chose it as they are starting to engage in imaginative play, 'cooking' in their kitchen, playing with puppets, etc. They know what the grocery store is, and can relate to the concept of selecting items and bringing them to the register.What surprised me is how engaged they have become with this toy. They love pressing the buttons, repeating the words and sounds and arranging the food on the shelves. For the first week they had it, it was the first toy they played with in the morning and the last one. Weeks later they still play with it every day!"
4,"good knife, needs sharpening, great for price point","I ordered this and the 6"" chef as as well as 5 other brands, I thought I might try them and buy the set. They are Good, solid, cast or forged, not likely stamped as the tang/shoulder/blade are one piece around 1/2"" thick at its thickest part. the rubber handle may someday cause a food/water trap if washed in the dishwasher though hasn't yet, it is slightly stretchy. I've been using the dishwasher with electrasol all in 1 gel packs, no rust or stains using the heated dry cycle. this and the chef needed a touch up on the sharpener to get them to a fine edge, but it didn't take much and made a world of difference, the edge they come with is OK, but thats probably as much to do with shipping as not. I would say for the money your spending, it'd be hard to beat. I have big hands and the grips are comfortable. my wifes hands are medium and she liked them as well."
4,Great Knife,"I purchased this knife to go along with the 4in Santoku and I am very pleased with both knives. I use the 6 1/2 in knife for cutting meats and larger type vegatables/fruits such as watermelon or cantalope and in all cases it is like cutting through warm butter. I have had to sharpen this knife a couple of times, but then I have to be really careful because it is so sharp. The grip makes it easy to use and overall - I am a happy camper!"
5,Love my Oxo Good Grip knife,"The Oxo Good Grip Santoku Knife is great and completes my set of these knives. Consumer Reports was ""right on"" when they recommended Oxo Good Grip knives. Why pay an arm and a leg for a more expensive brand when these work so well!"
4,A great foray into the world of santoku knives,"This was the first santoku that I have ever used, and it has been a wonderful experience thus far. The grip is nice and wide, fitting my fairly large hands easily. The heft of the knife leaves a bit to be desired, though this may be alleviated if I had purchased a longer blade. The metal itself feels sturdy in my fingertips and is slightly flexible on the x-axis, though only with a fair amount of pressure applied. The blade itself is well honed and cut through meats with ease. The spine of the knife has a bit of a bite on either edge, but you are able to apply pressure with your palm without hurting yourself. The blade won't generate enough force to cut through anything terribly thick in a single stroke, but with constant and firm pressure, even the toughest meats will be cleft in twain. I can't give a 5, as this does feel like a beginner's knife (and rightfully so), though for the price it is a must have. Oxo has satisfied me once again."
4,Excellent knife,"Learn how to slice or cut its really fast with this knife, Good Grip, Balance. I brougth this for my wife (Chef Student) and she love it. Is the best quality for such low price."
4,Nice and sharp!,"A very nice knife, easy to handle and clean. Good balance and sharp!Only gave it four stars because we never had an expensive santoku knife to compare it to. It definitely does the job. Would have been nice if it came with a sheeth for storage."
3,Not High Quality,"I have used this knife for three+ years and I was surprised at the good reviews it got online. The handle of mine is completely disintegrating. The rubber is sticky and if you rub it with your thumb pieces will peel off. Several small chunks have popped off as well. Food also sticks to the blade as I'm chopping and I have to repeatedly wipe them off before I continue chopping. It's sharp enough if I sharpen it regularly, but not razor sharp like I would prefer."
4,Larger Santoku Knife,"Bought this knife because I was looking for a larger Santoku to chop through larger, harder vegetables. I have four of the small ones I use daily for most of my chopping. But, I needed a larger one and the large chef's knife I have is slightly awkward as I have small hands. This is a perfect size for a larger utility knife and it is a great price for the knife. I was looking for something to use everyday without spending a fortune on a knife and this one works well for what I use it for. Good value for the price."
2,Disappointed,"I was very disappointed that this knife was not sharp enough to easily cut through a tomato when it arrived. It's performance improved after I sharpened it, but it quickly became dull again after a couple of uses. I would not recommend this knife to anyone."
2,"Arrived Dull, Won't Hone","I don't use this knife. It wouldn't cut butter, as the cliche goes, when it arrived and my sharpening tool doesn't help. I have 30 year old knives from the grocery store sharper than this."
3,A Little Disappointed,"I've been using this knife for over 6 months now. I don't have any gripes about how the knife feels in my fairly large hand but I'm a little disappointed in its performance. One of the selling points of a santoku knife is that food is not supposed to stick to the blade while slicing. Unfortunately, that has not been my experience using this knife. I don't know if the scallops need to be shaped differently (longer? wider? deeper?) or if I'm just expecting too much from the knife. I do have to say food releases a bit more easily than with my western-style chef's knife. The blade was quite sharp when it arrived and has been easy to maintain with a steel. In spite of my disappointment with the food release, I usually reach for the santoku over the chef's knife since that one is badly in need of professional sharpening. All-in-all, I'm not sorry I bought the knife but I'm not as thrilled as I expected to be."
1,Nothing like the original,"This book was scanned and then OCR-ed from the original out-of-copyright version. However, no one thought to look at the finished product and the formatting is horrible and there are no Hebrew characters, just gobbledygook where Hebrew is supposed to be in the original. Do yourself a favor and search for an online version of the original manuscript and use that instead of this lazy copy."
2,huh !!!!,"this little book is ok , pics are nice but if you are a true Barbara Steele collecter, then there are perhaps 2 pics i have never seen, other wise , i've seen them all a hundred times over...well it's your money that;s all i can say...truth be told....;]"
4,ONLY PHOTO BOOK OF BARBARA STEELE FILMS,"RARE AND OUT OF PRINT soft cover 38 page booklet is the only picture book of Horror Scream Queen Barbara Steele's work. Lots of rare pictures (every page)in color and black and white. Includes pictures from her non-horror work as well. Wish they had printed a larger hard cover version, but this is the next best thing. Still has lots of great pics! Barbara Steele is one of a kind! Best work--PIT AND THE PENDULUM, BLACK SUNDAY, PIRANHA and CASTLE OF BLOOD."
1,Best Senator Money can buy,"What an entrepreneur! Get elected to the US Senate, marry an ambitious woman and put her in the business of lobbying congress and government agencies. She gets the dough and her husband delivers. Is this legal?"
2,Scratch His Green Cover and You'll Find Red,"In this book, left-swinger Tom Hayden proves he'll do ANYTHINGto attack the concept of private property. Not that attackingexisting religion (for not being environmentally aware enough) or having the effrontery to propose the ten commandments be modified along lines that suit him better (ah, child of the 60's...) represent anything that far out for Hayden. It is an interesting intellectual exercise, all the same --- just as long as the reader remains aware that in the end any verbal utterance by Tom Hayden is sophistry."
4,An Excellent Insight on the Sherpas of Nepal,"A very informative and readable book. The author provides a thoughtful and moving account of the Sherpas and how their community is being transformed by the forces of modernization. The book is well-researched, thorough, and balanced. The author's personal accounts and anecdotes that cover a quarter of a century, complemented by excellent photographs, are particular strengths. Excellent reading for anyone with an interest in the Sherpas of Nepal."
2,Dry reading but what shoud you expect?,"I purchased this for research I am doing for a project on Nepal. It is rare i find truly engaging books during my research. This book did not engage or hold my interest, but it did provide some good information to a point.If you are able to filter out his obvious distaste for external influences on this culture, you will find the book informative. The portions that were interesting involved his personal stories with the local population and with Sir Edmund Hillary. I understand it is difficult to make ethnographies interesting, however this was like eating sand."
5,Nice intro to Discworld,"This was my introduction to the Discworld series. An entertaining little book, Mort is an endearing character that I became quickly invested in. DEATH was very amusing to read about as well. I love that Pratchett writes with a wink and a nod to all the absurdity that happens. Yes this or that situation is absurd, but its amusing in its absurdity!I plan on continuing on with the Death series. Reaping Man being next on my list"
4,Amusing Story of Death,"Mort is a pretty ordinary awkward teen. A liability on his family's farm, he is sent to seek an apprenticeship elsewhere. Just when Mort thinks he is completely unwanted by anyone, he receives an offer--by Death.Working for Death actually isn't too bad. Mort simply has to be there when someone's time has run out, to sever their ties to life. In his off time, Mort lives at Death's home with his daughter and his servant.Death decides that Mort is ready to try the job on his own, while Death spends awhile exploring his own humanity. But when Mort is sent to kill someone he really doesn't want dead, he takes action--an action that has ramifications for his world.This was a very amusing story, with great characters. It managed to get across some of the important features of Discworld without being overwhelming or confusing. I enjoyed reading this book."
4,"Death: ""I could murder a curry.""","While Mort is at an Apprenices' fair, where teenage boys are picked up by tradesmen to be apprenices, he is the only boy who is not chosen. However, when midnight chimes, Death comes and asks the boy to be his apprenrice...Although Death has featured in discworld novels before, this is the first one wher he is one of the main characters and he is very much developed here.Death decides to take a vacantion and ""live"" by visiting cities such as Ankh-Morpork while Mort is left to do his job of visting people when they die. However, Mort falls in love with one of his ""clients"" - a beautiful princess - and instead of collecting her, he saves her from ebing murdered, thus starting an increasingly-serious chain of events because he has changed the way the world was ment to be by allowing her to live.This book was very funny and amusing and full of the usual wonderful discworld characters."
5,Wonderful and witty!,"Terry Pratchett has outdone himself this time! Death is my favorite anthropomorfic personification and in this book Terry writes Him like he should be: Logical, Literal and A Laugh Riot! You read, captivated, as Mort grows in to the role of Death's assistant, and ultimately becomes him. A wonderful book and a must-read!"
4,this is good - and the rest get even better,"The first Pratchett book I read. Have read all since that day many years ago and eagerly anticipate the new books. The book contains the quote of the decade - 'What's a curry?' - 'You ever eaten a red hot ice cube, that's a curry!'Having read all that Terry has written I recommend to all to read them - especially 'Moving Pictures', the Witches books and The Guards books (Wyrd Sisters, Witches Abroad, Lords and ladis and Masquerade (Witches)) (Guards Guards, Men at Arms, Feet of Clay and Jingo (Guards)).Also if you know England and have seen the Omen then read Good Omens - I shall say now more other than read and enjoy!"
1,THE BOOK BEATS ITSELF TO DEATH! zero,Strata & The Colour of Magic were beautifully funny and I highly recommend them. BUT everything after those first two in the discworld series is trash. Too stupid. Like monte python. Slap stick. Not funny at all.IT'S LIKE THE BOOKS BEAT THEMSELVES TO DEATH! I am quitting the discworld series and going on to try some of his other works.
3,Anthropomorphic Personofications,"I love Death and all of his quirks. The story grew a bit tedious toward the end, but Mort and his escapades were delightful."
4,Very Fun and Witty,"This is my first Terry Pratchett book - and frankly, after reading this book, I'm not sure why I didn't start earlier. But first - ""Mort"" tells about Mort, a young boy living in the Discworld who is looking for an apprentice position. Fortunately (or not), Death - yes, the grim reaper - is looking for an apprentice and Mort seems like a very good candidate. Mort takes on the offer and starts a rather bizarre existence.. especially since he falls in love with one of his ""Clients"" and refuses to let her die, thus, challenging the destiny and gods of the Discworld.As a stranger to discworld I was a bit afraid that I will not understand many of the puns and ideas of this book, but it is *completely* self contained. I did feel there were some references that I wasn't familiar with, but nothing which ruined the fun in the least. Very highly recommended, reading it was a nonstop pleasure."
3,"Not his best, but still pretty funny","What I remember about Indiana: laying on my grandparents' rug in the den late at night spread out reading Mort. It's not Terry Pratchett's best, in fact, it's one of his early ones before he got into the swing of things, but it had a good ending, which is why all of us read. Exciting, funny in parts, but not the hard hitting satirical edge that I love about Pratchett."
5,A WITTY COMEDY,MORT IS A WITTY AND FUNNY NOVEL BY A GOOD AUTHOR ME AND MY FREIND CALVIN HUSSEY RECOMEND IT.
5,Only the sequeal is funnier,The only other discworld book that is funnier than this one is the sequeal Soul Music. If you buy this one the next one you should buy or just read is Soul Music
3,sheep shag compared to color of magic,Im kinda getting turned off by thisI think he's stuck on using the dungeon dimensions as end for everythingcolor of magic had far higher number of cool ideas
4,Needs a better latch.,The only reason this item didn't get 5 stars was because the latch the is used to open it feels cheap and feels like it may break soon.
4,Great album,"Cherie Call is solid in her craft and performance. the songs in this album are very real and good. These songs made me feel how god protects us and the way He helps us to see the big picture, the ocean in us that we never knew existed."
4,"Very helpful, but badly edited","The systems are very good.You will of course need to tune them, but I am generally very impressed.The prose is also very good, and I have much better insight about how to design systems like this.The only downside is that the code fragments in the book1) are not available for download on the web, which is just silly in this day and age;2) are very poorly edited; they contain syntax errors and obvious bugs.So poor technical editing, but great content."
2,Disappointed,"I acquired this book because the authors had previously written a very good one, ""The ultimate trading guide"". I am very dissatisfied. There is nothing here that you can not learn by reading the Trade Station manual. I was expecting to learn some of the fine points of the software, the use of DLL's, or the interphasing to other software. Unfortunately, I did not learn a thing. There are also some strategy examples which are slight modifications of the ones appearing in their previous book, and some interviews with system developers, that are unfortunately about 2 years old. What can you learn from the answer to questions like ""What do you think the hot markets and stocks are this year?"", when the answers are two years old?In summary, overpriced and almost useless."
2,Fails to live up to expectations or its price,"The information about TradeStation is easily replaced with the manuals available from the company. The trading systems included have some interesting features, but the design and analysis is far inferior to what you'll find in, say, Conway & Behle's ""Professional Stock Trading: System Design and Automation"". And the editing of the text is very sloppy. This would be a decent value were it a $30 paperback, but as a premium priced book it dissapoints. There are much better ways to spend this much money on books about stock trading."
3,Dated but some useful information,"I'd call this book a beginner/intermediate level Tradestation guide. It starts with the very basics of EasyLanguage and then moves into some simple trading systems. If you get the Easylanguage beginners guides from Tradestation, you wouldn't need the first third of the book. I was looking for some coding ideas as well as some debugging ideas. I did get both from the book. The middle of the book is the good stuff and had some trading systems and debugging methods, but not $60 worth. The book appeared to be packed with all kinds of useful information but there is a lot of useless fluff, the last third of the book had lots of Reserved Words and reference stuff that isn't necessary to include. There was even interviews with system developers. I thought this was about building trading systems?? As was mentioned in previous reviews, try to find the book used. Also, the book was published in 2003. The code in the book is about 4 years old and is still usable but dated."
3,Seems to work,"This is not a review from me on the whole book from Pruitt & Hill, just a quick note. I backtested the first two systems on a collection of large cap stocks and ETF's and they seemed to be working pretty good. Nothing amazing though, no 1000% returns or something like that, but still pretty decent results. Especially King Keltner did pretty good in my backtests. I also tried to apply them on a number of mutual funds (with limited data) and I was happy with the results."
3,me enviaron el guante que no era,"Buenas tardes tengo una queja ya que pedi un guante para la mano izquierda y me vino para la mano derecha cuales son los parametros a seguir para la devolucion del guante y su posible cambio, gracias!"
3,Unnecessary Violence,"I enjoyed reading this book, and as a rule I enjoy Jill Barnett - but this wasn't her best book. The plotline is nice and the main story is good - but she spends too much time in the beginning in the head of the villain. I think the villain in this book is completely unnecessary. She didn't need to add him at all. True there is the nice side romance that comes from the villain but it really has nothing to do with the main characters and their story. It seems like is was just added there at the end so that Kit can play hero. Also the violence within the story serves no purpose. I think that the story would have been nicer if there was a little more interaction between Kit and Hattie - especially at the beginning. But otherwise it was an OK read."
4,Even good comes from a large fire...,"Hallie Fredriksen's father was lost at sea, she was shocked to discover that he had named Kit Howland to be her guardian. This was a man who she had always thought was hansome but who she had poured hot soup over during their last meeting.Hallie is left to care for her brothers and sisters when her father goes to see. This time it has been a long trip and everyone is starting to get antsy about his return. When one of her sisters breaks the branches off an apple tree in their neighbors yard and he demands payment she goes to the bank only to end up having to deal with Kit.Kit is very surprised to see she has grown up and doesn't even recognize her at first. He is drawn to her though he still fights the demons of his late wife.There is fires, loss and gain in this story. I liked it and recommend it to anyone who likes period romances from the American West Coast."
3,Not a Great Read,"I was recommended this author, to read and will try a few more before I completely lose interest in this author as I believe this was one of her earlier novels and I feel she might need more time to develop her stories a bit more.I didn't find the characters to be very well fleshed out. I was pretty much bored with the story. There was no real zest or zing to keep me interested.I would not really recommend this book."
2,Would not recommend,This book was dirty and I feel like the conflict was terrible. I expected more after reading Carried Away. I strongly suggest if you have a gift card then buy this book but not with your own money.
1,NOT WORTH THE TIME,"This book entices you with a potentially interesting plot and potentially interesting set of characters, but its clear after a few chapters that this won't turn out to be much of a mystery, and that there really won't be much logic to anyone's actions. I don't know exactly what the author had in mind when he thought up this, but its clear he had plenty of help from all the TV shows of the 60's and 70's. I could swear that some of the characters and scenes were borrow ed straight from them!"
1,LEAVES YOU WITH A BIG EMPTY FEELING,"This book is so poorly written and developed that you really don't end up with much when its over. The mystery is quite weak, and judging from the comments of other readers, it is very predictable and unsuspenseful. The characters are very unrealistic and are unable to emerse the reader into their emotions and actions. The American lady, in particular, comes across as someone with deep-rooted problems and how she and the Chinese lawman could hit it off is totally unreal. The symbolism of the mystery to that of the theatre escapes me and was quite muddled to me. The motives behind the entire plot are absolutely ridiculous and impossible to accept. So, you're left with a strong feeling as you read through the book that everyone--the characters, the villain, the author--is just going through the motions to arrive at an ending."
1,"THIS WAS ONE THAT I DIDN""T ENJOY","The author lacked the strength and forcefullness to pull this off corredtly. The descriptions of life in Shanghai were dull and weak stereotypes of what you'd expect. The characters were predictable and exactly what you'd expect. In fact, the problem with the whole book is that the author really didn't come up with a creative approach and instead, took heavily from TV shows of the 60's. I dont think this book is worth reading for those reasons."
1,TOO WEAK OF A BOOK ON TOO MANY FRONTS,"Not a particularly good mystery. Not a very accurate or plausible police procedural novel. Not a very good exploration into modern day China. Not a good character study. In the end, this book fails to capture much attention and the characters are forgettable."
1,Rather weak and predictable,"I found the mystery really not much of a good mystery at all, and the mood and style of the book was never completely developed. It seemed to me that the author didn't take the time to really labor at making the locale and setting right to the reader. The love interest was totally preposterous, although, the authors' predictable style was so blatant, you could see this was coming for miles. When it did occur, it was by no means interesting or even facinating--just another boring event to get over with so we could move to the end of the book. Why did he write this way???"
1,WHAT A BORE!,"Not enough originality to this one. Boring plot and characters. I thought the novel read like a 60's TV show, and I sure didn't like all the profanity."
1,ONE OF THE WORSE ONES I HAVE READ,Ugh! I finished this book with a completely frustrated feeling over how incomplete the book was...the plot was juvenile and the writing was boring and predictable. Shock scenes for no apparent reason. Leave this one alone.
1,DID ANYONE GET THIS?,I read the book and was astonished at the weak premise and poor ending. The book was a tease--it promised so much and ended up with nothing. I can't see why some like the gritty style in describing Shanghai or in describing modern China for that matter--nothing really unique there. The lawman Fong seemed to be interesting at first but the abrupt changes at the end were unworthy and deceiving. Definitely not my cup of tea...
1,"VERY PREDICTABLE, BELOW AVERAGE MYSTERY","Its hard to find anything really noteworthy in this book. As a mystery, it is pretty lame since the killer and solution seem obvious by the second chapter. As a charcter thriller, its terrible; the Chinese lawman and American widow is borrowed from countless dime novels and the romantic aspects are ridiculous and a bit insulting. I found the acting analogies too obvious and again, very predictable. I'd skip this one if I were you..."
1,POOR CHARACTERS AND IMPLAUSIBLE PLOT MAKE THIS A DULL READ,"I was disappointed with the overall character development. Way too much profanity (and unnecessary at that) and the author didn't create credible characters at all. Most seemed stilted, or worse, a copy out of a old B-movie. The ending was a sham and I felt cheated. So many holes in the plot that it simply wasn't worth the time. I understand that the author is planning a second novel using the same Fong character and I hope that it is a better attempt because the overall characters and setting are intriguing."
1,NOT EVEN A GOOD IMITATION OF A THRILLER,"This book leaves you so unsatisfied, you're bound to be wondering what drove the author (and the publisher) to present it in its present form. Too many abrupt and painful shifts in style from the killer's perspective, to the widow, to third person that you really don't appreciate anything in the plot. The whole premise was utterly preposterous and unacceptable. The characters seemed like cardboard imitations of the real thing. And the suspense was non-existent by the end of the fourth chapter--you could predict how things would end up."
1,NOT MUCH OF A MYSTERY AND POORLY DONE AT THAT,"This should have been an interesting mystery. This should have had enough interesting characters and locale to keep the reader riveted. Instead, after a couple of chapters I found it very boring and predictable. No excuse for the gore and profanity. Real people don't act like that (let alone Chinese police) and the author's attempts to describe Shanghai read like a poor National Geographic. I wish the author could get a tighter reign on his imagination and find a way to get the mystery across. By the way, the ""love"" angle was utterly ridiculous."
1,NOT WORTH THE TIME TO READ THIS BOOK,Below average plot and unreal characters. I was disappointed with the entire book and felt that the author really needs to sit back and think more carefully before he writes again. What could he have been thinking about? I would sure appreciate his toning down the profanity in the next book.
1,RIDICULOUS MURDER MYSTERY,"This book reads like a first draft. I wish the author or at least the publisher had taken more time to have key elements better developed. The main characters had the potential to be interesting but instead, the author never developed them enough, and instead left them 2 dimensional. Very weak plot and the tie to a wider ""global"" angle made me think that the author never took the time to really think this one out. So much potential ... but the book really misses the mark."
1,Really weakly written with an unreasonable plot,"The novel isn't much of a mystery. Not really very suspenseful. The characters are treated very artifically so that its virtually impossible to understand or accept their actions. The global conspiracy elements are so weak, no one would accept them, even for a fictional book. The author's style is very plodding and predictable. To top off everything else, the love issue is wholly ridiculous and unacceptable."
1,Very Poor Book,"This book was so poor and defiicient in so many areas. I don't mind a dark book every now and then, but the author simply wasn't disciplined enough to make up his mind on what kind of book he wanted to write. The plot wasn't slow, but the plodding writing style made it seem that way. The characters were so artificial, it seemed like everyone, including the killer, were just going through the motions until the climax. The climax was a horrible disappointment considering all the effort taken to lead up to it."
1,UNABLE TO HOLD YOUR ATTENTION,"Totally unoriginal plot and theme--I've seen this before on countless TV shows from the 70's. I think the author was not able to succeed on any level--plot and characters were boring and the action was so very predictable. I was unable to feel anything after reading this, other than the irritation of having been taken in by over-enthusiastic comments from the publisher. This is a book that is easily forgotten within seconds after finishing."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS JUNK!!!,"I bought two of these locks. Within seconds one broke after the other. The weak link in the design, the lock housing is plastic. The plastic lock holds the metal pieces together. This lock should never be sold. I am disappointed in Amazon and Bully. The locks I received do not look like the one above. It is cheap. The model number matches LH-004, no where does the word ""pilot"" appear on the package. This lock does NOT fit a Ford F150 92' well enough to say it is compatible. This lock is the worst piece of junk I've have yet to buy over the internet. It should be pulled from the market."
1,Precaution,"I recently bought the flea collar for my pet, before i did my research, and i discovered that people should be incredibly concerned about the use of flea collars on companion animals, particularly those containing propuxor and tetrachlorvinphos in their active ingredients. These are both considered neurotoxins to mammals and known to be carcinogentic. These collars and their active ingredient chemicals pose risk of damaging the brain and nervous system of humans, especially toddlers, as well as the pets that they are used on. I am very dissapointed that a product like this is allowed to be sold in stores. I would suggest to do your research before buying this product."
3,Repetitive and convoluted,"There are some practical gems, but the author repeats his ideas and uses examples that are both banal and confusing."
3,Strategy,easy to read and easy to understand.general introduction in Strategy.Very good for a first read on the subject.
3,Good Introduction to game theory..,"Although this is a good introduction to game theory, I have to say that half of the book was interesting, the rest was a difficult reading (maybe it was just me but I couldn't focus in some chapters). The good thing about the book is that it change your way on dealing with situations and decisions, always rethinking on the steps to follow."
5,GOOD STARTUP,"For anyone who has taken up strategy classes from their college days, i can assure u this is a must read. i only gone through 3 chapters and i can tell u it will have a profound effect on oneself. The beauty of this book is the way its looking at the subject of strategy via storytelling and not steps or a process/method. Its a must have for anyone to see expales unfold themselves. Great read for those who just even curious about the concept of strategy"
5,Excellent,"If you want to become a successful manager, this is a good starting point. For those who want to understand the things that happen in their communities, a must."
3,Interesting read,"I had to read this book as part of a strategy course i recently took. The book is an interesting read, some of the examples are quite interesting and make it easy to understand the concepts. Its mostly about game theory. The reading is easy."
1,is this book for real?,"This book & the whole devotion to game theory, imho, is by academics; for academics; & has almost no relvevance in the business world. I'd like to see one Fortune 500 company; or one successful company anywhere, that has a ""game theory-centered"" approach to running their business. People such as Rudy Giuliani; Dale Carnegie; Jack Welch; Donald Trump; these are folks who show how to succeed in business. Game theory is merely knowing the competitive landscape. It's hardly worth writing books on."
5,Pretty Good,"It is hard to find one book that provides a full survey on the various stategic approaches, but this one does a fine job of presenting the approaches it addresses. It is written in a manner that allows those with limited understanding of business to grasp the concepts. I would have liked to have seen a broader coverage."
5,the bridging gap,This is an excellent text on the basic neuosciences and the clinical correlations in pharmacological understanding of the psychiatric disorders.The book raises the fundamental issue of diagnosis which is currently still an uphill task even for an experienced clinician because of the inherent limitations in the understanding of the factors leading on to the current presentation of the disorder.The neuroscientific understanding of the various conditions and drugs used and developed thereof is the hallmark of this standard text. It is essential for any clinician who wants to excel in the practice of pharmacological treatment of psychiatric disorders.
5,Basic Sanskrit for Yoga Practicioner,Ever wonder what your Yoga teacher said in Sankrit for a particular pose? This a great reference.
2,Wonderful book; however missing the CDs,The book is wonderful and I will use it as a reference constantly; however I was disappointed that I did not receive the CDs as promised. I haven't heard anything back from Amazon.
5,language of yoga,"this is a necessity for anyone studying,practicing, and/or teaching yoga. This book has opened a whole new world for me in that it is a strong teaching tool for sanskrit, chanting and asanas."
4,Little light but sturdy and very organized way to keep multiple controllers,"We bought 4 of these. They flip open and hold the XBOX controllers, rather than having to find them every time.These or plasticky but not flimsy. The controllers sit on there but not snugly (held by gravity)."
3,"Nice product, in totally wireless world","Simple, useful accessory product for a pair of Xbox 360 wireless controllers, especially if you have wireless headsets to with them. However, when using ""wired"" (and controller connected) headsets, the cradles are not really of any use. They should have been designed to hold the controller either way, not only without Xbox Live headset connected. Also, for at least one more star, a choice between traditional soft-white vs. black (Elite) color schemes, would make this a better product for both types of currently available Xbox 360 consoles."
2,Nice to have,"This cradles are nice to have, with it you don't have to start loking where are the controls you have it in a specific place and nice showing"
4,Wake up call,"This review is a wake-up call to those who have written above and hopefully to aspiring readers of the novel.First, the novel is in no way what I would call well written. It is an amateur telling with flat, stereotyped characters. It could use some additional editting.It is extremely fast-paced...things that most writers would take whole chapters describing, Katherine does with a line, but I actually enjoy that...STUFF HAPPENS in this novel.However, it is still a good read--not because of the writing, but because of the insight and tie-ins of new-agey, Art-Bell kind of stuff, like...remote viewing, the antichrist, even a dragon (rawr)!Some potential tag lines...A Catholic version of ""Left Behind,"" with an awareness that the Vatican has always been a place of contention between the forces of light and darkness.A good page-turner with some potentially accurate social/spiritual insight.A wake-up call for troubled times."
5,I only take in the evening,My integrative medicine MD friend recommended I take this product for anxiety and trouble sleeping. I take one tablet every evening around 7pm and find it relaxes me before bed.
5,Keeps me balanced,"My ob/gyn recommended this when I told her I had been taking gotu kola, and I feel it's beneficial for maintaining my energy and generally helping me feel ""at myself"" (as my grandmother would say) as I journey through midlife issues. It's a tonic type of herb that helps to round everything out. Not sure how else to describe it, but I think it has helped me. As far as I can tell, this is a good quality product."
4,Price is WOW,"The price will make you say WOW. But if you cannot find any scrapple where you are then I suppose it's worth the price. I love Habbersette scrapple, if you can afford this for 8 pounds then give it a go. Just be sure you look around greatly first because you can find it at stores for $10 for 5 pounds!"
1,What a rip,You can goto their website and get 6 pounds for 25 dollars. Also you can get rapa at thier website just google it.
4,39.99?,"Forty dollars for a 2-CD set of music that's been available for years on the low-cost CAM label seems excessive, insane really. God knows it's great music -- spectacular for a sunny morning -- but who's getting all this money???"
5,Best Cookie Ever - Vegan or Otherwise,I have been vegan for about two years. i love desserts and suffice it to say the selection of vegan offerings leaves much to be desired. These cookies are moist and chewy and not too sweet. Not too salty either as I have come across that. Not too oily. Vegan cookies can be too sweet and either too dry or too oily. There is a delicious coconut undertaste - the chocolate fools you into thinking it is milk. I like chocolate but most vegan chocolate is very dark or has a nasty rice dream aftertaste. If I were not vegan I would eat these - no crave these. My Whole Foods cannot keep this line in stock. Crazed sweet toothed vegans periodically raid the store and buy it out. Then we are back to boring fig newtons and dark chocolate bars (mmmmmm). Anyway - try it. I plan to buy from amazon now since I cant go too many weeks without a fix.. cheers
3,Is this worth your money?,"This is just what you would expect - lots of pretty pictures and some more pretty pictures, nothing more. In the mood for splurging on pretty models?? This is the book for you, otherwise..."
2,Terrible workmanship,"Purchased the Uncle Mike's swivels thinking they would be great since I like other Uncle Mike's products. The package arrived in a bubble wrap mailer after almost 2 weeks. When I took the swivels out of the factory packaging, I noticed that one of the swivels was bent at the swinging point of the swivel so that it made the swivel look cock-eyed when on the gun. The other swivel had a loose plastic cover on the turning/locking screw and made it difficult to cinch down. I think Uncle Mike's better start letting some people in the USA start making their stuff again because this was terrible workmanship. I will probably start buying only Blackhawk products again. The only reason I gave it 2 stars was because they did fit on an old shotgun and OpticSale.com did refund my money."
2,OpticSale is the worst vendor on Amazon,"Do NOT buy anything from this vendor. They do not stand behind their products. I ordered a set of Uncle Mike's swivel loops that rusted in less than 3 months. The gun was never exposed t water/rain. I contacted the vendor but they refused to send me a replacemnt pair of swivels. I quess $10 would bankrupt them. Never again will I buy from these clowns.Uncle Mike's Quick Detachable Super Swivel with Tri-Lock (Blued, 1-1/4-Inch Loops)"
4,Exactly as expected.,The swivels are exactly what I expected. The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because the locking mechanism is tightened with a thumbscrew which I wish I could lock.
5,Uncle Mikes is great,I have always liked Uncle Mike's products and this one is a winner. I put this on my 243 in minutes and it does the job. Great sling swivel.
4,It IS sold as a pair,"It doesn't say anywhere that they're sold in a pack of 2, but they are. Look very well made, I suspect the'lll last a long time."
4,Good quality,"Installed these in minutes, did not really need the directions.Quality seems good. No problems,sling attached easily, I would buy these again."
3,Needs more description,Nothing wrong w/the product. I ordered it for an application that it did not fit. Would work fine on a simple peg-hole on a hunting rifle.
5,Safe and Effective,This is the second VCR I ordered with her exercises. I like the way she presents the material and her no nonsense attitude. One of my big complaints in the past about exercise videos has been that the presenter has you do things that are paintful and even dangerous for your health. For years I would not do anything but Jane Fonda because she was the only one that had safe exercise programs. I am pleased to report that Ms. Austin's program is also safe and effective.
3,Denise Austin gets you in shape,"Denise has some good, basic routines for you, but you'll have to do them much longer than the few seconds she devotes to each exercise. Some of the movements are so slow and lax that I doubt your flab will be intimidated!"
5,Excellent program,I really like being able to select my own workout every day. This way I can shake things up without several videos being tossed around.
2,Denise-As good as ever,"I purchased this workout because I had used Denise's videos in the past (WAAAAY past-we're talking the 1980's..) but had gotten very lazy in the meantime.I started using them again,but wanted something more recent.This fits the bill for people like me,and for beginners,as well as those who are more advanced.It can be totally customized to each user's level,for example-LOW on cardio,but MEDIUM or HIGH for each segment on arms,abs and thighs.It also incorporates a bit of yoga,and the stretching segment is WONDERFUL.Denise,as always,inspires you with her encouraging and positive message,""YOU ARE WORTH IT!!!"" I have lost 12 pounds and two clothes sizes...Yeah,it's worth it!"
3,"Good, but Denise Austin treats me as though I'm a two-year-old.","On the plus side, the workouts are good and challenging. On the down side, I feel as though I'm sitting in a pre-school class. She talks to me as though I'm two years old. The girls in the background look as though they're from the ""Stepford Wives."" It just seems too well choreographed. This is not my first choice."
2,BORING,"I did not like this workout, despite the rave reviews. I never did a Denise Austin workout before and decided to try this based on what I had read. As soon as I turned it on and heard Denise talking, I could understand what everyone meant. She may be sweet but I found her voice and what she was saying completely unmotivating. Even worse was the fact that I was bored stiff. I felt like when I worked out at Living Well Lady back in the late 80's. I couldn't even finish the segment. I had to turn it off midway. Instead, I'd recommend the Kathy Smith Matrix- Body Sculpt. I ordered both at the same time and absolutely love that one!"
3,Good but the cardio is lacking,"The cardio workouts are not particularly great, but I like the other workouts. I like that you can pick higher or lower intensities, or if you want to work a particularly muscle group, you could do low, medium, and high and get a really good workout. I get bored easily, so I have several DVD's and different pieces of exercise equipment, and I do keep this in my rotation, but not for cardio. You seem to need a huge room to really follow along with the cardio, and I don't have it, so maybe that is part of it. I feel like I am constantly running out of space. She does have some good low-impact moves, though, if you need that. I was hoping to get some good cardio out of it, so that's why I am just saying 3 stars."
4,Good workout,"I really enjoy this dvd. I love that you can customize the workout for your time/needs. I love the low intensity option for the cardio segment since I have touchy knees and ankles. The only thing is if i'm feeling good in the knees and ankles I go for the high intensity and that it's more challenging, which I like, but I definitely could not do it on a daily basis with past knee surgery and many ankle injuries in volleyball.Oh well, however I VERY MUCH ENJOY HER UPPER, LOWER, and AB WORKOUTS! The low, medium, and high intensity for all 3 are great! You can really feel your muscles get worked! Its great also because its broken down so well you don't need to rush to buy a new DVD when you plateau if you stick to all low, then to all medium when you plateau at low and then to high when you plateau at medium, or mix and match! Whatever you please. Try it for yourself, you will enjoy! Great for me and my needs in my little apartment."
1,Missing part?,"I have yet to use this DVD as it just arrived in the mail today, but it promises ""an accompanying booklet with diet pointers and recipes;"" when I opened the DVD box, there was no booklet inside. This DVD was also not wrapped in plastic, which makes me wonder if said booklet was removed at some point. Very disappointed that I didn't receive the entire product I paid for....."
1,VERY BASIC!!,"I was really excited about being able to customize my workout and that is why I thought this DVD would be a good one for me. I found it to be very boring and also very basic. The abs were pretty good, but that is it. I like to be challenged and this did not at all. The advanced is not advanced. It is much more of a basic, simple, no sweat workout. I recommend Sharon Mann 123 the works if you are looking for a customized workout that will be good for all levels."
2,do not like it one little bit,"Let me start by saying that i have only done 3 of the available workouts, but I was not pleased. I found the cardio extremely boring, and the medium intensity upper body workout completely lacking in the ""Workout"" department. I have only been exercising since the beginning of the year (less than two months) and the medium intensity upper body didn't leave my muscles feeling anything at all. I have been doing a variety of other vidoes that I do enjoy. I also feel that her moves and techniques are stuck in the 80's. Not that they necessarily are less effective, but they bore me to tears. Maybe her style is for older people who are new to excersing. (I am 30) I do not recommend this at all. I am throwing mine away."
3,Personal Trainer,"I like it, but I don't love it. All of the exercises seem to be the about the same routine for lite, intermediate, and advanced. I didn't see a real difference between the sets."
3,"Her voice is irritating and distracting, exercises were ok","I read in another review that her voice is really annoying. I have to confirm that it is true. She whispers throughout the video -- really weird and distracting to me. There is an option to hear music only (instead of music and Denise). I only did the low intensity workout, so I can't comment on the med/high intensity workouts. The low intensity was ok. The exercises seem effective. I would have liked more commentary on breathing and form as we are doing the exercises."
2,okay for beginners,"I have several of Denis Austin's DVD's and have always been a fan of hers. However, I found this DVD to be very old fashioned. I used to teach aerobics 12 years ago and she was using alot of the same moves I used back then. I do like how you can personalize your workout, but this is not a DVD that I will use very often."
2,A Real Letdown,"I bought this based on all the great reviews and was very disappointed. I have a couple of other Denise Austin videos, but this is my first with aerobics. She should stick with Pilates. The movements did not have a natural flow at all and I got the feeling while I was trying to follow along that she forgot the script and was thinking up moves along the way. I would call the aerobics beginner, except for the difficulty in trying to figure out what Denise is doing.The toning is better, but still beginner, not intermediate, even at the most advanced level.The ab workout was quite good and was a decent challenge, but her rhythm is off. I also really liked her stretch at the end.The progammability of the DVD was awesome, but it's not enough to redeem the lousy aerobics."
4,Denisa Austin Excellent!,This is a great Dvd by Denise Austin. Very easy to follow. Create yur own workout to fit into our own time schedule. Very motivating! Great variety of choices for your own customized workout!
5,L-O-V-E it!,"I ordered this DVD with high expectations after reading all the reviews! I've got to tell you... it met all of them. You can choose an all Low level, Moderate level or high intensity workout (which includes abs and full body stretch) or you can truly customize your workout. The DVD lets you preset what level you want for every specific workout before you even start so that there aren't any interruptions between the chapters. I almost hate to admit it but... I choose the Low intensity workout starting out. I was sweating more than what I thought I would. I even still found some of the Abs and thigh exercises challenging!! I think that Denise is EXTREMEMLY motivational and can really help you keep up your momentum. I know many times I would remember to tighten my Abs while exercising with her catch phrase, ""Zip up those Abs!!""*I would recommend this to everyone at any fitness level because this is a workout that than ""grow"" with up as you become more fit! 5 stars from me!"
5,Perfect For People Who Are Over 75 lbs. Overweight,If you are anxious or apprehensive about exercising - then this DVD is for you!This is a perfect DVD for those of us who have more than 50 lbs. to loose. The segments are only 10 minutes long - not at all overwhelming. You can add as many 10 minute segments to your workout as you want.You do not need ANY equipment - not even shoes! I did this workout on the first time in my PJ's - without even a brassiere!The exercises are the same as I did when I was in the Army - basic stuff that even the most uncoordinated - like me - can easily do.This is a great DVD to build your self-confidence.
4,I loved this except the legs section,I really love Denise and have been using her workouts on and off for years but this dvd and a lot of her others lack a solid leg routine.Even the challenging routine on this was not really that great.Everything else was great.Loves the way the dvd was set up.I use everything but the legs.For a solid leg routine The Firm is the answer.
3,Like all but the aerobics portion,"Maybe I'm just lame, and I've never done the aerobics thing before, but she changes the routine too quickly. Just as I get into the groove with one thing, she's got another move. It's too frantic, even the low impact version. Other than that, I like the other workouts on the tape, especially the lower body and the stretches.The aerobics routines she does on the daily tv show seem a little more attainable."
3,"Good workout, but...","I really feel like I get a good workout with this DVD. I enjoy the customizable cardio/strength combinations, and my abs feel nice and sore afterward. But Denise Austin is kind of a twit! Seriously, she can't count at all. She often says ""two more"" [reps], and there will actually be either more or less than two. She jumps into new moves and reps without warning and if you haven't done the workout a million times (as I have) you won't be able to keep up. The pacing is also a bit terrible. I always thought the standard number of reps should be 8, or at least an even number, but she switches around and does odd numbers of reps - like 11. That said, this DVD is one of the reasons I lost weight several years ago, and I'm determined it will help me lose weight again."
5,GREAT!,"Love the high intensity routine (and the low intensity one too, but I do the high one when I want a more heart-pumping workout). The breakdown of the toning components is fantastic, and I totally love the legs + abs toning segment (and ok, the upper body / arms segment too!). Very good instructions, and I have always appreciated Denise Austin's enthusiasm and sincerity and passion in her work. Her personality and/or style of instruction have never annoyed or bothered me once.If there's only one exercise DVD to own (in terms of workout + range + value for $)...it'd be this one."
3,Not so good,Denise is generally annoying. The hardest/advanced options are very very non challenging. If you are a beginner then it might be a good option.
5,Great DVD,"This is probably my favorite Denise DVD. It is super easy to set up a workout that I want. If I don't have a lot of time I just do strentgh training,which has three levels:easy,mod.,or hard. Each lasts 10 minutes. It also has two 20 minute workouts easy and hard and a kickbutt 10 minute ab workout. The dvd allows you to program whatever workouts you'd like. I started seeing results as far as toned up muscles in two weeks."
5,Fantastic workout to develop!!,I have had this DVD for over a year and am still loving it! It allows you to move at your own pace by adding weights or moving up the ladder of intensity. I love how you can pick your workout from the menu so if you only have time for arms and legs that's all you do! I'm also 20 weeks pregnant and was able to move back down to the low intensity aerobic to help maintain muscle tone but still get my heartrate up. I highly recommend this for beginners and those that exercise regulary!
4,Not bad,"This is a decent workout dvd. I have grown to get over Denise's perky personality and focus in on her strengths.This dvd works perfectly for me because each segment is fairly short so that by the time I've finished with one, I feel motivated and encouraged to do another segment. I actually prefer the intermediate lower body workout rather than the advanced. I put on three pound ankle weights, do the beginner lower body segment and then the intermediate segment. After that I move on to upper body, abs and then stretch. a pretty good workout."
4,Great Workouts on this DVD!,"I've been working out with Denise Austin for at least 10 years. I have several of her videos and DVD's. I also used to do her ""Daily Workouts"" on Lifetime. That being said. I took about 2 years off of exersise to battle cancer and when I was healthy again I wanted to lose the steriod wait I gained. Who'd I turn to? Denise!I know some people don't like the way she talks, but I like that. If she were dead silent it would be boring. This DVD is great because 5 months ago I started off at the lowest level. And I struggled. Now, I'm doing the higher level of cardio and I'm still only on the middle difficulty of the arms and legs!The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I wish it had a low level ab workout. I cannot get through the ab workout and I sometimes feel that I didn't accomplish anythng. But this is a great DVD especially for those trying to get back into shape!"
3,Denise is Cueless!!,"Every time try to follow Denise, she fails to prepare the viewer with what is going on next. In this program, following the exercisers is challenging with the abrupt body changes and pivots. Liked the toning segments, but again not much time to get ready to follow as the moves come fast with no warning. Did not feel got a good workout. Her eyes widen with wild energy, lots of talk, but hey can't you cue and instruct??"
2,Not Impressed...What's All the Hype???,"I bought this DVD based on other reviewer's comments and it's 5 star rating. This DVD may be good for beginners but if you have been working out don't bother!!! The routines are boring, monotonous, and very uninspiring. Also, the routines are not long enough to actually have any effect. I have other DVDs that are set up like this in which you can choose which routines to do and even those, in 10 or even 8 minute intervals, give me more of a workout than this. The only good thing about this DVD is that you can shut out Denise's voice and just follow with the music. Save your money."
2,"Please, Denise, give it a rest","I was used to Leslie Sansone, so Denise Austin's method of diving right into exercises (with very, very few reps) without any warning was rather alarming, as were her unnaturally white teeth. Add that to the excessively bouncy movements (which I'd always been taught were dangerous) and a cardio section I wouldn't wish on my worst enemy, and I realized the only parts of the DVD I thought might be useful were the abs and upper body. I returned this one after viewing different bits of it, realizing that I'd never follow through."
1,workout dvd,The compact disc had perfect video but no audio. Would have cost more to send back then I paid for it so settled for no sound.
2,Not for me!,"I really thought this would be a great dvd and I tried hard to like it, but I just can't.I don't like Denise Austin - I find her way to cheerful and I don't think she looks or sounds anything like someone enjoying her workout. I even think she looks a little insane. There's something about her eyes. No, she's just not for me.Although I really like one segment on it and that's the upper body workout with weights. It's a great segment and that's the one part of this dvd I've ever used (with the sound turned off)."
3,eh..,This DVD is ok. I wouldn't really recommend it though. The exercizes are very basic and repetitive. I only watched it once.
2,This is a joke.,"Those 3 to 5 minutes routines are jokes. There is no way we can get ""fit"" in that time. There is no such a miracle. Definitely, this DVD does not worth the money. It might work for someone that has never worked out in their life. Maybe it is good just to start. The 20 minutes aerobics is not that bad if you don't have anything else to warm up with."
3,alice deejay,i think it is good it is realy good for teenageres it is like cher's belive i love it if you don't that your problum.
1,Not the Correct Item,"Beware of ordering from Amazon partner vendors. You might be better off going to them directly. When I ordered the power adapter, it was not clear in the Amazon listing which was the correct model number for the digital recorder I also purchased. When I discovered the mismatch upon receiving the merchandise, I had to return the adapter to the 3rd party vendor, and I was not refunded the full purchase amount. :("
2,boring/doesn't always work,"My 3 1/2 year old daughter just received this as a gift. Like the other reviewers, the dragon often pops up on the first try or not at all. My daughter didn't find the game very exciting, and I don't blame her. There doesn't seem to be any educational value, either. I think if your child needs help with fine motor skills (putting the flags in), it could be useful. Maybe it would be better for a 2-3 year old than a 3-4 year old."
1,worst vendor ever,i received this product and it did not work from the start. icontacted the vendor by phone and e mail. i did hear back from them despite various attempts. i am basically out the money and have a broken toy
4,Great sound quality!,"In places, this CD rocks harder than most of their popular material. The variations on some of the songs are fun to listen to. The guitars crunch better and the vocals are great. In summary... this CD captures the heavy in Strypers heavy metal.I don't see Motley Crue or Poison around...You can't stop the TRUE rock!"
3,Completes your Stryper Collection,"Good but not great work from material you have already heard. They were much harder and more raw when they were Roxx Regime, but this one certainly worth a good listen. You will enjoy hearing different versions of some old songs. Definitely buy if you are a Stryper fan!"
4,Information age philosophy in a nontraditional format.,"I liked this book. The text is presented in an alternative fashion that really makes you think. Marshall McLuhan portrays his philosophy that the written language and industrial technology lead to a non-tribal life style, and a less feeling society, and that the new information age (television and computers) are leading society back to a tribal, verbal, more feeling society. In Counterblast, McLuhan uses an unorthodox style of text, text as an artform, versus text that is read left to right, to make his point. This book may have been written in the sixties, but a lot of what he has to say is still pertinent to today's information society. I do not agree with all his views on Television. In that some of the things he saw as benefits, thirty years later I see them as blights. It does make me wonder though, if thirty years from now the things I currently veiw as benefits of the PC, will still be viewed as benefits."
4,It Wasn't Meant to be the Book,"This is review is for the Redwall Movie, animated for American audiences. Anytime a book is adapted into a movie there's bound to be changes, and this is no exception. I challenge you to try and adapt a full-length book into a cartoon series or movie and keep it within the time and budget restrictions. For those who are die-hard Redwall readers, the movie or the series might be a bit of a disappointment. I have a personal rule - never expect the movie to be exactly like the book. With this said, our family enjoyed it very much, and I believe that this was intended for a younger audience - those that don't or can't read the Redwall series for themselves. If you want straight-up Redwall, stick to the books. If you want an enjoyable cartoon with a heroic and noble storyline for your young children (ages 5 and up), then get this."
1,don't buy this film!,"redwall ""the movie"" is nothing but a chopped up version of season one of the series. save yourself a couple of bucks and get season one instead. i was shocked that they tried to pass this off as a unique story even in the previews for season 1 they attempt to sell you on ""the movie"". it's the exact same story except with 2 hours of footage chopped out! you can't take 13 episodes of a series, squash it into 90 mins and still retain development standards and then on top of it have the gaul to charge more for this butchering! i'll calm down now but please grab season one instead and get the nearly 5 hours of story the first season deserves."
5,Useful for teaching,Good companion to the book because young men can privately contemplate their own struggles as they work through this book alone without feeling like they are forced to share intimate details with others.
2,inappropriate,"Regarding the book itself not the workbook. We were looking for a book to help young men keep their thoughts in check. This had way too much specific information in it telling about other mens impure thoughts. Gives them way too many ideas, fodder for a more difficult battle in my opinion. This is still adult material not good for teens. I was very disappointed."
2,hmmmm,the normal book was good but i think this book it better if you are in a group and everyone has the book and the workbook...
3,Buyer Beware!,"I bought this because of rave reviews, but 75% is lip-synced junk or at best live singing over backing tracks. If you're an obssesive fan of CSNY and Sly & Family Stone like I am, then you have to buy this for their real live songs. That adds up to a great 10 or 15 minutes. The Rascals, Janis and a few others are live and decent, but wait till you can get this for $5 bucks, not $20. James Brown without his band! It's a crime against humanity. Most of this you will watch once at most.I mean Smith? They walked right out of the Billy Jack movie.Do you want to see David Steinberg and Lily Tomlin before they were famous, or funny? Some day Sly and CSNY will put out decent DVD's of all their live performances. C'mon Neil!"
1,You got to be kidding me!!!!,$76 for a CD that isn't even a faithful reproduction of the original album? Unbelieveable. You guys should be ashamed of yourselves....
4,Wondrous,Great voice.Haunting lyrics.Lovely melodies.Suzy K. has the talent and intellect to take us to new places....and leave us smiling.Great album!
4,Great for the price,"I am a Chef Instructor at a training facility. I use these knives as a graduation present for my students. They have a good weight, shape and an ergonomic handle. OXO is a fantastic company. I SWEAR by their tongs! They rock. I have never been dissapointed by this line for the value and price. If you want to keep your knives sharp, NEVER put them in the dishwasher. Hand wash only!"
5,Great knife if you take care of it,"This is a great knife - good balance, good feel in the hand (the grip is excellent). It is an outstanding value for the price.But, like all good knives, you MUST take care of it to maintain sharpness. Clean and dry it (by hand) immediately after each use. Don't even THINK about putting it in the dishwasher. It is preferable to use it on a softer cutting surface (like wood).Take care of this knife and it will take care of you. It will hold a sharp edge without frequent sharpening."
4,"Excellent for the money, a little lightweight","I got this for my wife to use after she kept stealing my Wüsthofs and not cleaning them. :D It's much more pleasant to use than the crappy, stamped garbage knives she used before. Easy to sharpen, nice to use. My only complaint is it's a bit light and thin compared to the Wüsthofs. But for the money it's a peach."
5,Awesome!,"The knife is used in a Chef Kitchen and have been very pleased with it! The delivery was on time...communication Thur Amazon was excellent.....I'm 100% pleased with product, delivery and customer service!"
4,Cheap Phrasebook with a HUGE Catch,"funny, embarrassing, and dirty. This book is all laughs and a little but of education. Ignore the English romanization is it is the worst I've ever seen. However, the translations and Korean is spot on. If you want to learn some great insults, cuss words, and the worst ways to compliment a women, pick up this book. I can't help but look at it from time to time to see how might I make my buddies crack a smile. It truly is a unique book and certainly the only one of its kind (other than the ""sequel"" book of course)Having said all that, it does contain some dirty language that must be handled with care especially in the presence of Korean people. I'll save you the story but just know that some of the words and phrases here can get you into big trouble if not used properly.[...]"
4,Good collection of phrases,"I was generous in giving this book 4 stars, but I did so because the book actually has some useful phrases to learn. In that sense, it's one of the best phrase books I've seen. But I'll repeat the gripe that many have: the author's version of the romanization is just plain incorrect in many cases. The author did include the Hangul (native script) and the official romanization of Korean. But be warned that without experience with the language, this book alone will not make you able to be understood by Koreans.So bottom line is: the book is great, but if you use the author's idea of the pronunciation you'll often be speaking nothing more than gibberish. Learn to read Hangul, and you'll find this book extremely helpful."
4,making out in korean,This book is very interesting.It has many subjects to address and I really like the subject on making love.I love the Lover's Language.Saranghae.
5,Excellent product,"Yes, the aromas are enchanting and fun, but the product is really good. I didn't believe you could really use these for shampoo, but you can and your hair will be soft and fluffy and lovely!"
3,Can't believe this is R.A.W.,"I have been a big R.A.W fan for a while, and I was really excited when I found out he mixed this cd. It looks really cheesy on the cover, but I had to give it a try. After listening several times I must say that I am disapointed. This cd is just way too mediocre. If you have ever heard R.A.W. before then you know that he spins hard beats, with some hip hop and some and a lot of trickery mixed in. None of those element are on this cd. The only reason I gave it 3 stars is because of who it is. If you really want to hear his good stuff then order some of the mix cd's he sells online."
4,"So Far, Working Like a Charm","My face has lately been breaking out worse than ever, and I knew I needed to try something else besides my daily face wash. I ended up buying this and giving it a chance. Surprisingly, it's healing all of my acne.Little bumps aren't really going away, but the few that were close to or were white heads are gone. On top of that, one scab is healing quicker than it should've. This is definitely helping and I'll keep using it.But just be aware of something - .5oz is a darn small jar. It came in a huge box for the size (about 6 inches by 8 by 4) and in another box that was the packaging for the actual jar. The jar itself is barely an inch tall. Don't be surprised. It works well for the money but it was definitely a shocker."
5,Wow,"This is just one of many, many products I've tried to clear up my skin. For the last 6 months I've tried everything possible & nothing has worked.Finally I came across this stuff & within the first 3 days my acne started shrinking & now it is still red, yet not bumps anymore, just spots that are getting smaller each day.Finally something that works without drying out my skin or burning. I wear this under sunscreen & makeup in the day & under moisturizer at night.Jar is small, yet worth every penny. It only takes a little for spot treatment."
2,pHaze 33,"I would not recommend this product, esp. if you have sensitive skin. It did not help my mild acne. The smell was too strong, I guess it is the sulfur. It left my skin red for hours wherever I applied it. I could not put it on during the day."
2,a nice book at a steep price,"I liked this book and want to give a higher star rating, but I can't justify it. For the steep price, this book is overall just mediocre. The story is intriguing, it does a very good job of drawing upon the Dracula stereotypes and showing how the new Requiem Dracula differs from ""common knowledge."" The artwork is at times stunningly brilliant, and on other pages downright hideous to look at. I finished reading the book in just a little more than an hour, which was disappointing. The only real information you might get about the Ordo Dracul, or Dracula himself, from this book will probably be repeated in the Ordo Dracul sourcebook for the Vampire the Requiem RPG. Overall, this book will probably be worth the money to a collector, but I would hesitate recommending it to anyone unless its at least 40% cheaper."
5,"Short, Sweet, To The Point","A very useful book for those of us who would rather save money and start our plants from seeds. Gives easy to read instructions on how to save, store, and grow seeds and how to care for them after they've sprouted."
3,Basic Gardening Info,"This book is a quick and easy read. I have been gardening for a few months and was hoping to learn something new. I was entertained, but I didn't learn anything. I've read several gardening books, but wanted specific information on saving seeds to start from scratch. She touches on saving tomato and cucumber seeds as well as some flower seeds. She discusses hardening off as well as various pests and diseases, but goes into little depth. It was enjoyable, but don't expect to learn anything unless you are a novice (read a person who has never picked up a shovel or touched a seed)."
2,Misleading title,"The reason why I purchased this book was because I wanted to learn more about the Chinese Dim Sum (those we can have in the Chinese restaurant, served in the steaming cart). However, the recipes inside are just different kinds of Asian appetizers and some of them are repetitive. In addition, almost all of the recipes require you to deep fry your food instead of steaming (majority of the authentic Dim Sum are steamed food)."
4,Take your blood pressure medication,"This book by new author Nancy Steedle, brings the reader into the world of our heroine, which has slowly tilted from the normal into the bizarre. You also see into the mind of a killer, and witness the series of murders with an awful understanding of what makes that killer tick. The high blood pressure ending is one you should plan to read at one sitting. A great first effort, I hope Nancy treats us to many more featuring the same crime stopper team."
5,Captivating to the end...,"A truly great mystery, with twists and turns to captivate the avid mystery lover. Steedle writes with such flow and presents the picture well for a mystery that keeps unfolding and wanting you to read more. I give this book a big thumbs up... I look forward to the next one in this series."
3,Good Amature film,"AUDIO- 4/5, GOOD AUDIO JUST DIDN'T MATCH THE MOUTHS OF THAT ACTORS PERFECTLY.VIDEO QUALITY- 4/5 SOME GREAT SHOTS WERE TAKEN, THE HD ISN'T BLUE-RAY BUT IT LOOKS DECENTLY PROFESSIONAL.STORY- 3/5 I CANNOT TIE IN THE BEGINNING AND THEN END THIS MAY CHANGE IF SOMEONE CAN EXPLAIN IT BETTER.ACTORS-2/5 THERE ALL AMATEUR ACTORS AND DID A DECENT JOB BUT THE HOLY PRIEST WAS WAY OVER THE TOP AND UNBELIEVABLE WITH THE OVER POWERING VOICE AND CORNY DIALECT IT TOOK FROM THE REALISM.KILLS- 3/4 SOME LOOKED COOL! TIM BUNCH'S DEATH WAS VERY CREATIVE AND HAVE A TRUE MOVIE FEEL WHICH I THOUGH WAS AWESOME! OTHERS WERE OVER THE TOP AND THE BLOOD LOOKED LIKED MAPLE SYRUP.OVERALL- WAS A GOOD OVERALL MOVIE FOR A LOCAL FAN OF HAUNTED HOUSES! IF NOT LOCAL AND LIKED TO SEE HOME TRADEMARKS SUCH AS DOWNTOWN BUFFALO AND THE GARDEN VILLAGE PLAZA I'D LET THIS ONE GO. BUT IF YOUR IN THE MOOD FOR A LOCAL HORROR SHOW IT'S NOT TOO BAD!"
4,Good for a younger child.,"Yes, the game is repetitive, but aren't most? Anyway, I think this game is being unfairly judged. I bought it for my 4-5 year old and she enjoyed it. Perhaps it would be boring for an older kid, though. Anyway, For the price, I can't really complain."
1,Princess Natasha....,This is the dumbest game ever. I got it for my 5 year old and she couldn't even play for more than 10 minutes. Don't waste your time or money. At least we got it for cheap...
1,natasha: studen/ secret agent sucks,Worst vidio game ever I couldn't even bring myself to play past the rist level. Unless your buying for a young child don't get it
5,Black Angus Ribeye Steaks,"Wow, these were the very best steaks we have ever had and would reccomend buying any of their meats! They are good people too and answer any questions!"
1,Will you get it,This company has spiked up 30% in negative ratings in the last 30 days. The feedback is consistent that people have been waiting over 30 days and have not received the product yet. I am in the same boat and as I am already out the money I am concerned about whether or not they are even in business. They have not responded to customer emails in weeks. Look elseware.
5,Work great!,"At first I was skeptical about getting these fractional weights.After training a while, a 5 pound jump became too much.I used these weights to get past the ""plateau"".As whimpy as adding these weights to the bar may look, I am making great progress as opposed to the people who regularly lift the same amount of weight every time they go to the gym, thus never making progress."
3,Whose House?,"At times intriguing, at times annoying, but ultimately satisfying, this play wavers between farce and serious drama and then leaves one guessing."
1,My ferrets didn't like these at all!,"I have three ferrets, all of which hated these vitamin treats. I actually ended up throwing them away, because my ferrets would never eat them. These treats are hard, which my ferrets don't like. I would recommend getting the 8 in 1 vitamins in paste form instead, my ferrets love that!"
2,"Bought for my daughter, don't fit well","Bought these for my daughter while she is learning to swim, she is 5. She likes them, but I don't. Specifically, the strap at the back keeps sliding down and getting tangled in her hair. I have adjusted the strap many times and cannot get it to stay on her head for more than 5 minutes. So, I am just teaching her to not use them."
2,Strap broke at first swim meet.,My 8 year old daughter liked these but the strap broke at here first swim meet. Defective product! And since we bought these a long time ago to be ready for swim season there is no return option.
3,can't use them anymore,My kid forgot this in the van for a day and the seal wrinkled up and did not seal anymore.
1,Too big!,"After reading the previous reviews, I was very excited about this purchase. However, apparently these goggles are not all created equal. My son is 4 and by no means has a small head, but these goggles are just way too big for him. We can only get one side to get a seal on it at a time and then the other side basically goes part way around his head and so water comes into the other side and I am sure it is probably somewhat blinding to have part of the frame almost in the way of his other eye. Actually, my son had recently begged me to get him a pair at the dollar store and they are total junk. However, my son says he prefers the $1 pair over these. These are just too big and uncomfortable for him."
5,Kept the water out of my daughter's eyes,These are super goggles and fit perfectly on my 5 year old. Kept the water out and she loves them. They are comfortable and easy to adjust.
3,Great swimming goggles while they last!,"These goggles work well but as with all goggles we have bought fall apart, break, or loose suction after a few uses. I have not found a good goggle product yet and we go through about 20 pairs a summer."
3,Maybe not using right?,These still leak and fog on the kiddies. I haven't found any that doesn't yet.
1,Snapped in half - buyer beware!,"6 weeks after purchase, used once a week, for half an hour each time, these kid's speedo goggles snapped in half at the nose bridge. We live in Portland OR, so dry weather is not to blame. The product is inferior and should not have broken. Went to return it but the window had passed."
3,They fit well but...,You can find the same product at Walmart for half the price. My daughter loves them but they are just too expensive on-line.
4,"Very good, no leaking and falling anymore","Indeed a very good product. No more leaking or fuzzy but I gave it 4 points since as the other reviews said the marks around the eyes are very strong compared to other goggle. The marks do fade out after several hours. The other point deduction is the ease of adjusting the length of the band. It is at the sides and hard to adjust. I do like the double bands at the back. Better than single band, hold the thing at position much better.Be aware of the non-adjustable band between eyes. It is kind of too wide for a normal face size of a 4.5 yrs old. Should be good for 5+."
2,Way Too Big For A Toddler!,"These really should only be advertised for ages 5 and up. They are waaay to big for my daughter, so now the search continues."
3,Too Big For A 3 Year Old,"My 3 year old took swim classes this summer so bought these for her. They are really big on her so she gets water in them all the time. Guess I am just going yo save it until she gets older.Other than that, they look pretty cute and am sure will be useful at some point."
4,The bridge is too wide for 5 yr kid,"The goggle looks good, but the bridge is too wide for my daughter. Will have to wait for a couple of years to use this one. Buying another one with adjustable bridge piece."
5,"Good comfortable fit for 3 year old, 6 year old and 7 year old","I ordered three sets of these goggles from Amazon a few weeks ago. They are very easy to adjust, and the UV protection is very effective in direct sunlight. My six year old son and seven year old daughter have always complained that their previous goggles were uncomfortable around the nose or that they let water in. So far they have used these new Speedos twice and they seem much happier (no water leaks, and no complaints about discomfort). For my three year old girl these are her first goggles; I put them on her and she proceeded to play although they were not even on. I am very pleased with this purchase and recommend these goggles to parents of young children."
2,You will find this credible...<handwave>,"2 1/2JMT to me represents mistakes one may make in haste to pursue credible hip-hop through ""underground"" suggestions. Besides for initially deep and alluring, though ultimately shallow and repetitious conspiracy-based lyrical content, there is nothing more overground than bored bits of boards-n-beats."
5,Psycho-Social,"Alright, lets break it down. Usually this album gets positive feedback, but alot of people listen to Violent by Design first and expect this to sound the same.......thus they are disappointed. This has alot more unique sound than VBD, but the production quality is not as clean. Dont let that throw you off though. PsYchoSocial is just as (if not more) mind bending than any other jedi mind release, (though I dare say visions of ghandi will top them all)with references to government conspiracies throughout. Pick up this CD if you want to see the roots of JMT and get a thoroughly enjoyable listening experience....you wont be disappointed."
5,Original and great album,"this cd is a creative and original one, this is Jedi Mind Tricks first album and it is a classic, some tracks get a little weird such as ""Chinese Water Torture"", but besides that these tracks have that early 90's lyical skill to them plus it has some scientific lyrics, and you guys know how stoupe gets down on the beats, so go and check it out."
2,......what happened to vinnie,"his voice is raw as hell but he needs better lyricism..... all of his lyrics in his new stuff after violent by disign are just average and hes sounding like a amature.. I mean im getting to the point where i think Jus Allah wrote his stuff for him on that album. Hes so lucky that he met stoupe with his sick ass beats... Im so sick of hearing him say in like every song ""ima put [insert a number] shots in your spine, baby (or daddy mommy or cuzin) what ever its getting old...I swear in like every song he says daddy/mommy/cuzzin for 3 lines or more at end....................He needs ""The God"" Jus Allah back at his side. peace"
5,Handbook of Fixed Income Securities,"As a newly minted auditor of a financial institution related to the mortgage industry, I needed a reference book to help me understand the terms and concepts used by our entity's finance and risk management personnel (my degree is in accounting, and my background in auditing was not related to financial institutions). I also needed help understanding the complexities of the financial instruments we are involved with (interest rate swaps, mortgage backed securities,...). This book explains mortgage backed securities, collateralized mortgage obligations, convexity, duration, how to price an interest rate swap at inception and at any point throughout the life of the swap, all without requiring the reader to possess a finance degree. At 1400 pages, it's a bargain. I just wish my version was post credit crisis. It's still relevant as a 2005 edition."
5,This book is an excellent review to the professional.,"As a fixed income analyst for a major corporation, I have used this book to review material that I have not used for some time. This book should become a ""bible"" to all those who are in the financial markets and without a doubt should be a leading source of information to all those pursuing higher education within finance."
4,BOB (Best Of Best),"Although the money and height of this book are so ""High"", however, I also think the content of this book is higher than these ""High"". In Taiwan, we believe that there are gold in the books. This is the book which have gold.Adam Hsu (Taiwan)"
2,Follow up on Amit Gupta's review,"I totally agree with Amit's review. For a practitioner's perspective Bruce Tuckman's ""Fixed Income Securities: Tools for Today's Markets"" is a much better choice than Fabozzi."
1,Kindle TOC Doesn't Work,"If you, like me, want to carry a copy of this standard reference book around in your Kindle, be aware that the table of contents in my version is non-functional. Considering the paper copy is around 1,300 pages long, this makes it difficult to find exact spot you're looking for in the Kindle version.I would wait until McGraw-Hill fixes the electronic edition before purchasing a copy.Has anyone else out there had a problem with their Kindle version TOC?"
5,Michael Goldberg - Alberto Vargas : The Esquire Years Vol. II (Vignettes S.),"The book is only 4 inches x 4 inches. I failed to read the description carefully, However, for a used book it was in excellent condition and a small treasure.Excellent service, product, price and value.I am a happy online shoper at Amazon.com"
4,Human Wildlife,"Wonderful read! Humor stuck in the middle of weird creatures you sort of want to know about. The photomicrographs are very detailed, but the regular photos are poor and out of focus. Quick and fun to read"
2,"Cute, but that's about it","Yeah, it's cute. It's fun to play with, too -- for the first 5 minutes. The calendar on it is completely disfunctional -- it will have no use to you. And, it's not really reliable. Mine broke the second day. Makes a cute add-on for a gift, but not as a functional piece of equipment. Really overpriced."
1,fundamentalist propaganda,"The arguments postulated against christianity in this work are either intellectually superficial or based on negative emotion.Mr Brunner's work would only convince the already convinced.I would recommend reading ""Leaving The Fold"" by Edward T. Babinski for much more challenging arguments."
4,Great for Long Car Rides or Just Hanging At Home,"I was never one of those people who felt the kids watch too much TV. It isn't how much they watch, it is what they watch in my book. As long as it is educational, fun, and didn't drive me crazy I was OK with it. The songs and movies on Scholastic's The Wheels on the Bus Sing-Along Travel Kit were songs I could sing along to also and that makes me even more happy.The kit comes in an easy to carry travel case with a handle that easily fits into any bag or can be carried by the littlest helper.Inside the easy to carry kit is:# 15 musical storybooks on two DVDs# 13-song CD# 24-page activity booklet# Crayons# Travel tips for parentsThis is the perfect addition to a long car ride. Our personal favorites are ""There Was an Old Lady Who Swallowed a Fly, and Dem Bones."
4,My daughter is happy,It Entertains her. She loves books to music. Cute stories. Cute songs. I would recommend it to anyone that enjoys Scholastic stories.
1,NOt what I thought I was getting,"This is weak. I thought it wold be CD's to sing along. Well, it is a DVD and the whole thing just looks and feels cheap."
1,Mostly myths...,"I didn't like this book, because the subtitle: ORIGINS - PHILOSOPHY - PRACTICE is very misleading. I read a lot about the origins of kung-fu, even in chinese. But I'm sure the origins are NOT a blending of the first episode of the series kung fu (with D. Carradine) and the movie ""The 36 chambers of the shaolin monastery""! So I was very dissapointed when I read this book. It's mostly myths and fairy tales Lewis regurgitates, he gives no sources and never tells anything about the philosophy of martial arts. So if you surf the web and collect material, you could probably write the same book. But it's O.K. for a rainy afternoon and some good laughs, if you find something familiar, like the dim mak, known from the movie bloodsport...."
2,Boring...,"To put simply this is the biggest flashback you can get out of the series. While I did think these different armors were neat, it alone was what kept me from breaking this dvd in half. It was all for finishing my collection of a very good series. I don't want to bust the OVA too badly but it is what is. I could look away and just listen to what was being said 3/5s of the time. Did I forget to mention no fighting...flashbacks and emotional pity are all you get. I know the point that they were getting at with denying their armors, but I personally love fighting, it just makes me think that they were just being lazy with what could have been an hour long movie and an epic finale at most. I will keep this for collections sake but other then that, I won't be watching this again, wasted a portion of my life, but I at least saw through it to the end. I'll miss you Ronin Warriors"
5,asking a question,I would like to know the name of those songs on vernessa mitchellgospel greats cd and I would love to receive a copy of this cdcan anyone help me please my all time favorite song she recordedis He can do it and I'm hoping that song is on this cdthank you
1,An REAL Stinker,"Oh yeah, like I really want to hear what Mike Dukakis and George Bush's press secretary have to say about the Red Sox and Yankees. Please. Most of this book is just an updated version of a similar title published years ago, the rest is pretty slap-dash, a quickie book trying to take advantage of recent events. There's nothing new for real fans of either team."
5,"""Beautiful new coffee table book""","A beautiful new coffee table book on the Red Sox-Yankees rivalry is out, written by Harvey Frommer and Frederic J. Frommer."
3,Looks okay from a distance,"From a distance, or from the front, this will appear okay for my border garden. I wanted in for the front yard (small border by my sidewalk garden) but the quality would not be great ""curb appeal"" (I've relocated it to the backyard garden area). The back side of the fence is hollow-like not at all like the front. So if you are putting it where you will be able to easily see the back, it will look cheap. You can also quite easily see where it ""hooks"" together. My main problem was the description said it was 13"" high, which is not entirely true. They measured from the tip of the steak (that goes underground) to the highest point of the arch. It's actually about 9"" at the highest point from the ground. Overall, if you want a LITTLE border to tame back some bushes or flowers this could work good. It will by no means stop a dog or cat (very thin and flimsy) but if untouched it looks okay and spruces up the border."
2,Not a quality product,This is not a quality product. Flimsy and shorter than I expected it to be. It was not even worth the expense of sending back
1,I sent this product back. Was very flimsy and looked cheap.,I thought this would look cute along a narrow paved walkway but fencing was flimsy and looked cheap. I sent this product back and am awaiting refund.
4,Happily back to the action and adventure!!!,"The fact is that ""Deathlands"" is first and foremost and action/adventure series. All the nit-picking comes a very definate second. In this book, they get back to the action big time and, while I suspect that some of the series purists will find things to criticize, it was a real page turner, as opposed to the latest ""Outlands"" offering which read much like a text on physics, with the same level of excitement. I suspect that the purists will rate this as ""So-so"" but the action types will love it and hope for more."
3,Not one of the better ones,"Though I do still love this series. I wish there was a way to know when they come out, because I have lost track of them at this point. I love this series so much that I went back and started collecting them from the beginning and have almost all of them.Too many different writers since the death of the author have lent too many different voices and opinions, and I would like to see the series end at some point because it's formulaic. But I can't stop reading them..."
3,Not as great as the others.,"Starfall isn't a good read as the other 'Deathland' books in the series. I'm finding that since Laurence James aka: James Axler left the series in the hands of ghost writers, the series has lost a good deal in substance. The Encounter on the other hand brought much back into the Deathland fold, but Starfall I felt left many questions as well as an empty feeling when finishing the book."
3,to smallllll,it is wayyyy to small on tv it was alot bigger! thats my shortand simple but it is way to small
3,Good Advice. But Throw the Last Chapters Away.,"Yes, the movie production anecdotes are amusing and they help budding screenwriters realize some of the pitfalls of production. And yes, there's good advice throughout on dealing with celebrity actors, producers, directors and studios. But the last few chapters about the adaptation of the story Davinci didn't work for me. Pretty low stakes."
3,"Interesting ""Inside"" account of Hollywood","Give William Goldman credit for having the nerve to write this expose on screenwriting and moviemaking while still actively working in Hollywood. His unflattering portrait of how movies get made probably angered more than a few of Hollywood's elite. Nevertheless, the book is weakened by his inclusion of THE ENTIRE SCREENPLAY that he wrote for the movie ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,"" all 150 pages of it. He presents a critique of the screenplay as well for the aspiring screenwriter. Nevertheless, as a non-aspiring screenwriter, the screenplay had no value to me. Nevertheless, though a bit dated, Goldman's book is essential for anyone interested in how Hollywood works. It is not, as you might expect, a pretty picture."
4,Letter,"In this incredibly personal account, author shares his thoughts surrounding his mother's death with his grieving father. Paralleling the lenten season and the arrival of Easter, Nouwen takes us through not only his personal grief, but explores the meaning of death and the Christian approach to dying in Christ."
1,Worst Speakers I've ever owned,"at certain volumes mine buzz and crackle. you have to play with the volume to get the crackling to stop (and yes I've tried everything they recommend). on top of that 1 speaker just randomly cuts out. when they work and aren't crackling or buzzing they sound great, but what's the point if when off they hiss at you. they once woke me up in the middle of the night because they decided to buzz so loud. i despise these things..."
5,A great way to get in shape!!,I love this video and the instructor is great! No music to distract you and your breathing and the directions are straight forward and precise...Its nice to see an older woman teaching the class!! You WILL love it!
5,A Remarkable Talent,"The cd ""Tercera Dimension"" has a great style to it. Rock en espanol adds diversity to the musical genre of rock. All the songs including the music have its own unique quality. Julio is a great writer and musician, its a shame that Sony did not give him the recognition he deserved. But I'm glad that he did not give up he switched labels and formed ""Tercera Dimension."" Sony missed out on a remarkable talent.I highly recommend everyone to purchase this cd."
5,so underrated,"i got into spanish language music a couple years ago when i started dating a lot of hispanic guys and they always had mtv en espanol on. i have throughout the years collected a bunch of great spanish language male pop albums, but this has got to be one of my faves. i think it is absolutely amazing and think everyone should give it a shot whether you understand spanish or not, the words and melodies are amazing."
2,I'll be Honest - I haven't read it,"I haven't read this book, just read the magazine and reader reviews, but the idea of a book that tells us to replace honest communication of facts and feelings with vapid pleasantries is sickening. If your friend is pregnant and doesn't want to be, why *shouldn't* you say ""You can still do something about it""?!! Don't tell her it's ""wonderful"" - it's not, and you both know it. If someone asks you ""How are you?"" and you tell them ""terrible"" instead of lying with ""Just fine, thanks,"" then it's their fault for asking! If they weren't prepared for an answer, they should have ignored you - that's what they want to do anyway. I'm 20 years old and maybe too idealistic. Maybe I'll slip into the same rut of self-delusion and public acting that most adults are in. But for now I can say with perfect honesty: Miss Manner's idea of ""communication"" is sickening!"
4,Love this style,"Classic horror such as M.R. James, Lovecraft, Poe, Le Fanu, Machen and others are proof beyond a doubt that you do not need buckets of sex and entrails for a horror story to be successful. The stories contained in the collection are more creepy than horrifying or gruesome. The stories alone are worth five stars. I only took one star away for the formatting because the stories were crammed in pretty close together. But for a free book you can't really do much better."
5,Truly scary stories,"If you don't find ""horror"" fiction frightening, this is for you. These stories scare everyone. This edition also has a very charming cover."
1,Ghost Stories,The book has an Old English feel and never really captured my attention. A Dan Brown book it is not.
2,Disappointing....,"Perhaps my fear is a little too severe for this tape, but I did not find it at all useful. I was looking for a way to mitigate my physical symptoms and the author's suggestions/tips did not help in any way."
3,Hose too short...,"According to the instructions that came with the product, if you bend the hose in such a way as to create a radius of 3 inches or less, than you risk compromising the hose, which could result in failure.Well, if that is the case, I would highly recommend you go out and get more hose, at least 3 to 4 feet more, because that's exactly what I needed to do.It would have been perfect if Hayden provided another set of hose the same length as what was provided in the box. Also, although Amazon says it fits my Acura MDX, the hose was actually smaller than my OEM cooler lines, which made it harder to install.I also recommend that you attach the cooler using the provided ties as the last step, just in case you need to re-position the cooler. Once you lock the ties in, there is no way to get them out."
3,I agree with other reviewers,"First off, if you buy this go out and buy about 4 to 5 more feet of hose. Trust me, you will need to. Otherwise a very easy kit, durable, and easy instructions."
5,Easy cooler,Takes no more than a half hour to install and works GREAT. My tranny used to overheat but now runs and shifts smoothly. I have it installed in series going through the cooler first then the radiator with the cooler installed on the most outside of the engine and AC radiators.
1,Terrible book,"I simply don't get how come this book got so many good reviews. I've actually read Esther Derby's ""Agile Retrospectives"" book (which was good), and so I decided to buy this one.Unfortunately it was plain bad:- boring, too simplistic and style-wise poorly written- very basic. Meetings facilitation, one-on-ones, delegation, portfolio management, check-lists for new employees - is this all what management is about?- not a single word about leadership. The authors lost me almost instantly by writing that ""We don't buy the fact that management is different from leadership"" in the Introduction. It is actually different and what they're describing all the way are just pure management techniques.- a very limited, fake setup describing a mid-level manager that manages a group of managers. How about managing a technical group directly?Wasted money, wasted time."
5,Practical Indeed!,"I am very skeptical of most business improvement books and one size fits all methodologies, but I can tell you that this book absolutely shines as a glint of hope in the sea of business improvement noise. As opposed to trying to force a given technique that will apply to everyone in every business, this book provides some very ""real"" examples that exist in the software development world and some very simple concepts and techniques that can be used. This book is not written like an academic book of problems and solutions, but more of a story based book on a ""real world"" scenario, which truly solidifies the pragmatic name of the publisher. This pragmatic approach makes the book very easy to read, understand, and ultimately use. I think if you use at least one or two of the techniques presented in this book such as One-on-Ones and Big Visual Charts (BVCs) that the book will have more than paid for itself in terms of the time you will have spent reading it and of course the money!"
2,Decent at best,"This book is a ""by example"" style book. It makes up a fake manager in a fake office with fake situations and tries to use that to emphasize its points. This makes it easier to read than a text book, but has the downside of making it both very prescriptive and very limiting. Most of what is recommended will not apply to you unless you fill the same role as the fake manager they follow in the book.That said, the book does recommend some good practices. But over all, I found it to be too focused on special cases and not broad enough for its techniques to be extended and applied in circumstances not specifically addressed in the book."
4,Good book,I am a new manager and this book made me see how many things I'm not doing or what my manager is not doing either. This has caused me to wake up and begin trying to push for some changes in building teams instead of the groups that we are now.
1,Not sure why this book has good reviews,"First, let me say that I have read many books off the Pragmatic Bookshelf. Many of the best books I read during 2006 were published by these guys. With that said, this is by far the worst book I have read in recent memory. It is very simplistic and not very engaging at all. It's like a Fischer Price introduction to management. I did read most of it, but only because I was trapped on an airplane to Norway. Incidently, I left the book on the plane. It wasn't worth the shelf space in my library."
3,Play it or leave it,"This is cute poppy, not too candy sweet music featuring mixes from ""96 and ""97. Hi-NRG has a lot of the fun snappy Italian beats; some of the romantic French dance feel as provided with ""Tout Petit La Planete"" by Paul Bizz and Cindy Ree; and some Blue Ocean trance reminiscent of Robert Miles""s ""Children"". Also, I can""t help liking Restless""s nostalgic remix of ""Horse with No Name"". As much as I enjoy many of the individual tracks, I question the DJ""s heavy hand and lack of direction in the melding of his twelve selections. Manny Lehman is trying to cover an excessive range of genres from pop to remix covers to trance to beat in too little time."
4,nightmare alley,a hip and groovey horror twister with some really funny tales. appeals to the punk/chic audience and has some jolting moments that catch you off guard. scarlet fry has a really sick sense of humor!
2,Kindle version would be great if all of the content was all there,"In the kindle version of the book, I have content missing and no page numbers. This is the first kindle textbook I've rented that had this issue. Hope this issue is fixed for other customers to rent/buy."
4,Hotel Accounting,"Excellant review of Hopsitality accounting and Finances. great book for recapping and also for beginning managers, The book covers all the basics and has a good synopsis of the use of a P&L in keeping control."
4,Pretty Good,"This was the first thing I've heard by Front Line Assembly and I've now learned that it's also their last. What a way to go out though, wow. I was expecting something much more agressi but I was treated to etheral melodies with layers and layers of industrial undertones. Leeb's lyrics aren't all that spectacular but his voice fits the music perfectly, never overshadowing the bleak soundscapes he paints with the music. Think of a tuned down and less angry NIN with even a little Moby thrown in (at least his instrumental tracks) and some dance pop. Definately not as bad as some people have made it out to be, it's a good listen if you're in the mood for something a little unnerving yet horribly catchy. Great choruses. Reccommended."
2,Leeb it alone,"Front Line Assembly has been barely listenable since Rhys Fulber left to pursue his producing career. This album is yet another example of why.If you liked FLAvour of the Week and the FLA releases that followed, then this is more of the same. Leeb's music lacks any real vision, and often is quite boring. I certainly hope rumors are true that this is the last FLA album, because Leeb has already managed to kick the corpse around for too long.I admit, some of the soundscapes are nice, but I've often heard better. Check out the last two releases from Xorcist for some nice soundscapes, or any Download or In Strict Confidence release for some electronic wizardry.If you're new to Front Line Assembly, chek out their albums from the early and mid-nineties -- ""Caustic Grip"" through ""Hard-Wired"" and everything in between are all pretty darn good."
3,"more instrumentals, please","This is a very good album, but would be better with a more experimental range of vocals and lyrics that couldn't make a pitiful goth-geek look like an ivy league professor."
2,dissapointed,"Some good music here....unfortunately it is bogged down by irritating, monotonous and unimaginative lyrics. After track 3, I found myself scanning forward to find a little variation in the songs. I found very little.One good thing though, I have a nice c.d. case to add to my Dave Mckean collection.Bill Leeb just isn't as good without Rhys Fulber."
2,Assembled without due care and attention,"I normally tolerate the levels of cheese in frontline, but I think the Leebster overstepped the line here somewhat, around about the point where he wrote a song about birds taking flight and quiet moments to himself called Everything Must Perish. What?? This pushed it over the critical point for me. There are parts of this album I like - I dig conscience, backlash would be pretty good if they'd thought of some more ideas for it (it has a nice little minor key melody which is unfortunately repeated ad nauseum) and the song Epitaph's not bad, but apart from that it all sounds a bit predictable. I'd recommend a Fulber era album (Caustic grip to Hardwired) over this any day."
1,This cd saved me $1000!,"I saved about $1000 by downloading the mp3s of this album. How did I do that?Well, it's quite easy to explain. Front Line Assembly is no more than a giant batch of stolen drumloops, keyboard presets, a hollywood sound fx sample cd and hillariously bad lyrics and vocals. I saved $1000 because that's probably what I would have to spend to buy all the albums by the artists that originally wrote most of the drumbeats and sounds that you hear in front line assembly's recordings.Bill Leeb should get himself involved in the online pirating of sample cds so he doesn't have to wait until his albums make him money before he can afford the latest ones to make new albums with. Then he'll have cooler sample cds than ""Hearts of Asia 2"" to use for delerium as well : D"
5,EPIC!,"Overall one of the best FLA albums, especially if you are looking for atmospheric almost surreal movie-like soundscape material. Very accessible album, esp to those who have yet to be initiated into the ""audio-experience"" that is FLA. I've used this album to get more than one friend of mind into FLA. It worked wonderfully! Having just bought a mega-awesome pair of studio quality headphones, this album (which I've listened to extensively for years) is suddenly opening up in all new ways. I'm hearing things I've NEVER heard before, and I didn't think the experience could get any richer...but it has. There is layer upon layer of amazing sound crafting in every song. Fantastic!"
3,Not their Greatest Work...,"I've been a fan since about 1996 when hard wired came out. I then pursued the entire back catalogue and have eagerly anticipated every new release. This cd, when compared to the body of their work, reads much more like an anthology of their sound, without however one track that stands out above the rest. There was not one song that had the same ability to hook as ""Circuitry"" or ""Neologic Spasm."" There was not an anthem-type song such as ""Prophecy,"" from Implode--one of the best songs they've EVER produced. Everything is just kind of ""there,"" but never sticking out. Compared to all the rest of their cd's, this one didn't last a week in my cd player. Compared to most industrial cds, it stands out as good, but not great--there was no inspiration in this disc, and I think that any other diehard fans know what I'm talking about when I say that it stands up poorly against the body of their work."
3,Implode: Part 2,"I'm a long time fan going back to ""Gashed Senses"" who also still likes the newer work; I loved ""Implode"". This album however left me flat. It's not that it's bad, it just sounded to me like a compilation of songs that didn't make the first cut for Implode. Get it for your collection if you're a diehard, but otherwise there are better titles in the catalog."
3,"Great sounds, blase singing","This is by no means the FLA I'm accustomed to. To be fair,my first experience with FLA were Caustic Grip, TacticalNeural Implant and Millenium. From these three albums I'vebecome accustomed to great sounding music, movie samples andaggressive singing. However, in Epitaph we are left withjust the great sounding music. All the songs sound as thoughthey are being whispered compared to the rage expressed in several of Millenium and Caustic Grip's offerings. There areno movie samples in this album that I could find.I will continue to listen to Epitaph, but not as oftenas the other three."
4,Oxo Knives Are Great,"I had bought an Oxo 6-inch utility knife and liked it very much. The handle was comfortable, fit my hand and the overall balance of the knife was good. I then decided to replace my ""assorted"" knife collection with all Oxo knives, including the 8-inch slicing knife. It lives up to its name, does a great job slicing, is also well balanced and seems to keep its edge. I just use a few strokes on a sharpening steel to keep it sharp."
3,Not what i expected.....,First time i purchased this has a lot of alcohol 50% with water i normally buy a product that is much thicker then this called cratoxy but is twice the price also. So i take it for heart health will see if it does the job....
4,A much underrated album,"Made after a long hiatus in which other groups like Leftfield and Underworld made up and surpassed the ground which 808 State had made with early albums like 'Ex:el' and 'Gorgeous'.The album is very soft and pleasing sounding, apart from the harsh rhythms and rolling beat of 'Bond' with Soul Coughing's Matt Doughty's aggressive vocals, and also final track 'Banacheq' which is a breakbeat track full of squalls and noise.But on tracks like 'Bird' and 'Black Dartangnon' the saxophone of Graham Massey comes to the fore and has a huge, soothing effect and lends the album a more mature feel, which came as a refreshment in an age which was dominated by lager, lager, lager!"
5,THEY ROCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This is the best music ever.They are so cool. All the songs are great. Everyone should buy this CD.
4,Works great. A couple of issues.,In general this is a very good product although I have a couple of issues. Number one is fit. I had a hard time getting the right side of the grip to lay flat against the frame of the gun. I finally did but I think it should have been easier especially since the directions recommend you remove the grips to clean the gun. The other issue I have is with the placement of the on/off switch. I think it is awkward and prevents me from getting a solid hold on the gun.
5,Great decoration,The lights are bright and the ghost looks great in my window. Easy to put up and the suction cup stays firmly in place. I'm extremely pleased with this purchase and can't wait to use it again next Halloween.
2,Five stars?!? I don't think so....,"All I can say is that I am into chapter five, and still have no idea how to use Photoshop well enough to draw a happy face! This book seems to be going on about endless boring applications for Photoshop and saying very little about how to actually use the program. For instance, its going on about how to share files between Mac's and PC's, and all the potential pit falls (missing file extensions etc) before even getting into actually using Photoshop. Hello?! I just want to know how to use the program first, then worry about that stuff later (for God sakes, I'm never going to be sharing files with a Mac, so get on with it!) If you want to read about RLE Compession Scheme's and BMP Format Performance, but not even know how to draw a circle or use layers, then this is the book for you. If want a book that is going to get you up and running on how to use Photoshop, look elsewhere as I will have to do."
3,Mis-Titled Book,"The author writes in a friendly, likable style, and I think he really knows his stuff, but I'm totally new to Photoshop and, contrary to what is implied by the title and in the Introduction, this is NOT a beginner's book. He does cover some very basic material, and there are a few tutorials included, but sometimes he also gets into some fairly advanced (for beginners) concepts in the same sections, as if he were writing for intermediate-level users. I think this book is really more geared toward Photoshop users who already know all the basics of earlier versions of the program. I'm going to try a genuine tutorial Photoshop 6 book, then maybe come back to the ""Idiot's Guide"" to pick up on the helpful tips the author has to offer.If it were titled ""The Intermediate Idiot's Guide to Adobe Photoshop 6"" I might actually give it four stars or more, because potential purchasers would know that it's not a beginner's book, and not be drawn in to something that somewhat misrepresents itself."
4,Good but....,"This book is very helpful for people who really want to know how Photoshop works, and what all the tools and functions are for in the program. I read this book a year ago when I started using Photoshop for the first time. And it *definitely* helped me to learn my way around Photoshop, however if you're looking to know only about drawing and/or ""painting""/coloring in Photoshop, DO NOT get this book. This book covers all aspects and tools of the program and not just drawing. But, if you are looking to find your way around PS6 and want to feel a little more comfortable with the terminology and tools, this would be a great book to own, and a decent price to own it at."
1,Flushmate III exploding toilets 2nd review,"I sent in a review earlier on the wrong model--but it is a Sloan product. Beware of the exploding toilet--go online and google this--I discovered this problem from Consumer Reports--not from Sloan. I contacted the company and was sent a kit to repair my toilet and it took some effort to install it (wasted time). After I installed the fix, the toilet does not properly remove waste and takes two flushes. They sent me another kit to fix that problem. I have more to do with my life than fix toilets that I spent time and money on in my bathroom! Go with gravity feed--if I could, I would rip this Gerber (flushmate) out of our bathroom."
5,"Heats up fast, great iron.","I have tried and returned several other brand of iron, but this one comes out the best. It's hot and is very well built. The refurbished unit (I bought 2) works seamlessly, so I would recommend buying refurbished on this iron to save money."
3,leaks,I purchased this product based on the previous reviews. The reviews were excellent for the price of the iron. The problem I encountered was that it leaks water from the reservoir section - this is really aggravating when ironing.
3,"Iron is ""Remanufactured"", though Amazon doesn't state it in the listing.","I received this iron today. Iside the Amazon Box, the iron box was pulled apart and torn. Inside, the iron was scratched and there was a ""Remanufactured Warranty Notice"". The listing does not state that the iron is ""Remanufactured"". Shame on Amazon for not being up-front about the condition of an item.I will keep the iron because it would just be more of a hassle to return it. There was already an error made during my purchasing experience and I don't have the patience to find another iron, hope that it is new and hope that the order flows smoothly. Good thing it wasn't bought as a gift.Don't know yet about the quality of the iron. Will update later.Update: Iron works fine. :-)"
3,Some Issues....,"I purchased this iron because of all the raving reviews. It is a nice iron but I seem to have some issues. One issue that really bothers me is that it seems to turn itself off as I am using it and then I have to unplug it and wait for it to heat up again b/c that is the only way it will start over. It also leaks water. I have read the instructions over and over to see what I am doing wrong.... but I am convinced that it is not me... and that it is the iron. Also it seems that it works well on the cotton setting but not nearly as well on the other settings. Also the slider button seems a bit flimsy. But for the price, which was remarkably low, it is a good deal. It can still be used with all these issues... you just need to plan ahead for some delays."
5,Absolutely great..,I should say that when I first thought of buying this ....all I had in mind was how great could an iron be???...this is really great....looks stylish and as said glides easily....ironing is very easy..no need to apply force to move the iron along the garment..just glide it along and u r done.......also the vertical steam feature is wonderful.....woul recommend it to everyone...
3,"It's okay but it didn't refer to what I needed, for 1st amendment censorship.","Book was ok but wanted more description of if cases, espeacially involving first amendment cases about censorship and public forums and rights on college campuses."
3,An entire album of filler material....,"....but Ryan's lesser tracks still beat what most bands crank out as their ""top drawer"" material. ""Tennessee Sucks"" is a great title for a mediocre tune. ""Nuclear"" is pretty great while ""She Wants To Play Hearts"" is pretty boring. A mixed bag, for sure. Fans will dig it. Newcomers would be best off starting with GOLD."
1,"ryan adams ""demolition""","This release is like waking up with a bad whiskeytown hangover, with a toothache and a cardboard box against your ear for a pillow. i've tried repeatedly, and can find nothing redeeming or even vaguely interesting. It gives the ""y'allternative"" genre a black eye."
2,Not that good,"Bottom line is this is an album that should not have been released to the public yet. The recordings are also very bare which would be okay if this was ""Let it Be: Naked"" but it's not even close. So the songs which are already bad, suffer from simplistic intstrumentation. There isn't one song on here that's gonna grab you and hit you in the chest and make you say, ""I'm so glad I got this CD"". Look I love Ryan Adams and I'm a song-writer/singer myself and I think he's one of the best song-writers ever, but these songs are so forgettable. There is nothing to remember about it. So instead of this get Rock n Roll (if you like upbeat rock), Gold (if you like a mix of everything), or Heartbreaker (if you wanna feel what being sad is like through music and lyrics.)"
4,"More Great Tunes from Ryan, but Not Gold","This album contains a bunch of previously unreleased tracks from Ryan Adams, but wasn't intended to be an album release. It shows. There is some good material on here, but it obviously doesn't compare to the stunning ""Gold"" and ""Heartbreakers"" albums of the past. If you're new to Ryan Adams, I would recommend his ""Gold"" album as an introduction."
3,a hit-or-miss foray into different territory,"Despite Ryan Adams' contentions that he's not big into country or folk music, it's definitely what he's best at. Heartbreaker and Gold had this beautiful threadbare denim cowboy undertone, and his Whiskeytown stuff was straight alt-country class. Demolition definitely resembles what it is, a polished collection of demos, on which he tries some new tacks. In some cases, like ""Nuclear,"" it works. In other cases, like ""Starting to Hurt,"" he sounds like a Goo Goo Dolls out-take. The lyrics aren't his best either...if you buy the album, just skip ""She Wants to Play Hearts"" and spare yourself some ugly cliches. That said, it's still Ryan Adams. ""Hallelujah,"" ""Chin Up, Cheer Up"" and ""Tomorrow"" are wonderful, and pretty much worth it if you get the album with Super Saver Shipping. If I could give this 3 and a half stars, I would. But it doesn't deserve a fourth."
4,It's worth it,"There are six very good reasons why you should have this album. They are as follows:1. Nuclear2. Hallelujah3. You will Always Be the Same4. Chin Up, Cheer up5. Tommorrow6. Dear ChicagoThe rest of you can critique to death."
2,Failure of imagination...,"Eagerly anticipated this album only to be disappointed. For someone who has enough recorded material to release several albums (by his own admission), Adams shows little ability to sort it all out and pick his best material for release. In addition, the production values on this album lack imagination. It sounds tired. In a word, this album is, well, boring. Too bad, he has done and hopefully will do so much better."
3,definitely an outtakes album,"a solid outtakes record; by the way, 3 stars is a ""good record"" for all you people who overinflate grades. The rockin' tracks aren't nearly as good as on his other records, but several of the ballads are strong. He does get a little whiney at times, but he sure is a good songwriter"
2,Fans Only,"In 2001, Adams released Gold, a great alt-country record that balanced those two usually paradoxical genres of music and conjured beautiful images of being young and heartbreakingly in love. This year it feels like he's lost a little energy.Although tracks like (Track 2) and ""Cry on Demand"" are great songs, most of the rest of the album seems to be lacking some of the spunk that made Gold sound and feel so wide open and fun. Most of the tracks here suffer from too much mope. Take (Track 7) for instance which sounds like a horrible country B-side from Pablo Honey. Don't even get me started on (Track 13), five minutes of needless guitar dissonance and incoherent mumbling.The album is entitled Demolition, meaning that songs are meant to be taken as demos. I'm not sure what they would have sounded like ""finished"", but chances are that it would have been more enjoyable. For fans only."
1,should have demolished these tracks,"I'm a big Ryan Adams & Whiskeytown fan, owning all of his CD's. While Gold was a bit commercial, the more I listened to it, the more I appreciated it. Demolotion, however, is a major disappointment.There are a few songs where it sounds like Ryan is going back to his roots (which is good), but the writing it absolutely attrocious - especially coming from one of the best modern-day songwriters. It's easy to see why these songs were not previously released.I actually dislike this CD the more I listen to it, and have decided to shelve the sucker away with my group of '80's music that never get played.I hope Adams is spending more time on his writing & less time doing commercials for the GAP."
1,bad,"This is just NOT a good album. Period. I like RA, so don't believe the hype, this is a junk compilation."
4,"for rejected songs, this album is amazing","Ryan Adams has written over 300 songs that haven't been heard, and with this cd he lets us hear 13 of them. This cd feels more like 13 seperate tracks than 1 album, unlike Gold, which is why I only gave it 4 stars. However, all 13 songs are very good. Just to hear the most beautiful song ever, Cry on Demand, is reason enough to buy this cd. The song was obviously written for Winona."
2,Trivialities in Steroids,"This book seems like a Martin Gardner ""Mathematical Games"" column from an old Scientific American magazine, gone totally bonkers. A new kind of Science is Conway's game of ""Life"" turn into a nightmare. The use of ""I"" and ""me"" and ""myself"" (Only Irene is missing here) is so incredible pervasive as to make this book illegible. Perseverant readers will find out that ""A New Kind of Science"" is a collection of trivialities in steroids."
2,Here's the trouble:,"In theory, Wolfram is handing us the cellular automata version of Godel Escher Bach, Fermat's last theorem, complexity, and a Brief History of Time. Only his ego is very much in the way.As with other projects of this magnitude, the author can't help but feel that the opportunities for applying the new method and the new way of thinking will change e v e r y t h i n g. But at the same time he is obsessed with having the last word on the subject. And in order to do that he had to include all thefootnotes and full regalia.Trying to split the middle (between popular science and fulllength articles for scientists) didn't work."
1,An author who thinks he is the BEST,"This book is barely better than a master thesis. It is not revolutionary (despite the fact that the author insists it is original) nor brilliant. It is kind of a extensive research, like a research in a phone book."
1,Disappointing!,"I initially was so very excited to have this book! I informed my spouse that it would probably take me a year to digest it. Unfortunately, a couple of nights of reading revealed it to be a sham. If it wasn't Wolfram writing, Iwould think it was prepared by a fraud who was trying to convince us it was of great foundational worth. It isn't. The poorest scientific reading I have encountered."
2,This book is in need of an editor.,"This book is in need of an editor. The ideas are substantial and significant. However, the writing style is annoying."
1,Plagarism,"The most egregious aspect of A New Kind of Science is its lack of a bibliography, or lip service in the text, to show that Wolfram acknowledges his source material. He not only omits the references, he claims that most of the ideas were his (which they were not). Attributing the origin of previously published material to yourself is a well-known literary misdemenor--it's called plagarism. Wolfrom has insulted his previously sympathetic audience, and he owes the scientific world an apology.Nice graphics, though."
3,A mixed bag,"Not bad, but not all that it is made up to be. For example, the chapter on visual processing is devoid of all the knowledge that we have on the topic. Would have been well advised to have some co-authors."
1,Hubris run wild,"I have thoroughly examined this tome in order to find what new knowledge has resulted from the application of the cellular automata techniques. I have found none. There are no new equations in the area of Relativity or Quantum Theory. There are just endless patterns of black and white squares. One would hope, in view of the author's promotional statements that just one brand new equation - if only a little one, or even a new trivial one, would have resulted from the 10 years of work. Alas, I find none. The author appears to be overwhelmed with the importance of his work and his book. I fail to see why. This book appears to be another example of the well-known law that a book's importance and impact vary inversely with the number of pages and the weight. Not recommended."
