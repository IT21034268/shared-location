3,A little violent,I thought it was a bit much for my 3 year old. A little more violent than I was hoping for.
3,The Incredibles,"This is a decent film. It has a good story line. Superheros and villains, of course the good guys win."
3,More viloence than I rembered,I loved this move when I saw it in the theaters years ago. When I recently showed it to my 4 and 2 year old I was suprised how violent it was. I didn't remember that from my first viewing. I would not recommend this for younger viewers. My kids did not connect with the characters the way they did in other movies like Kung Fu Panda.
5,Greatest Pixar movie ever,"It's a great movie, it is very good animation and even better scripting. The Increibles is well worth the money!"
4,A must see for children 6 and over,"I am 12 and i thought this was an excellent movie. Yes it was a bit dark. But thats why it was rated PG right? The animation was great and yes it was long...but it wasnt boring. I don't know if I would recommend this to very young children and I believe that is the only downside.If you child is 3-6,you might want to view it first..escpecially if they are senistive with getting bad dreams. But over all 4 stars!"
5,kid at heart,my nephew got me to watch this movie about a year ago and i loved it.thanks for the great service.
5,The Incredibles (Two-Disc Collector's Edition),"Once one of the world's top masked crimefighters, Bob Parr--known to all as ""Mr. Incredible""--fought evil and saved lives on a daily basis. But now fifteen years later, Bob and his wife--a famous superhero in her own right--have adopted civilian identities and retreated to the suburbs to live normal lives with their three kids. Now he's a clock-punching insurance claims adjuster fighting boredom and a bulging waistline. Itching to get back into action, Bob gets his chance when a mysterious communication summons him to a remote island for a top-secretassignment. This movie is a class act and a lot of fun to watch."
5,Great Price and Delivery Time,"Shopping at Amazon is a real value. Some of the DVD's prices at the local stores are twice the price you can find on Amazon. Also, the other vendor's Amazon deals with have met or exceeded my needs."
5,classic storytelling,This movie is classic animated storytelling at it's best. It appeals to all ages and I could watch it over and over.
4,Cool Movie!!!!!!!!,"The Incredables is so cool! I liked Dash the best. Violet was cool to and so was Frozone. You've got to see this movie if you haven't seen it already. I'm 10 years old, and my sisters 6 years old and she watches this movie a lot in her spare time."
5,Did you know it was up for a Hugo award?,"This move was PERFECT! I can't say enough so I'll try to say as little as possible. It's smart, funny, deeply emotional, and real. If you haven't seen it please, don't let all the hype make you hate it like it's Harry Potter; there's a reason people were so blown away by it. You can see how much tremendous work and love went into it, from the writing all the way to the end."
4,"It is ""Incredible"" for a Black Biography on Racism","This is the best movie I have ever seen. It reeks of animation goodness. It animated my soul, my love life, and my spirits. Had it not been for the fact I was actually watching an episode of Good Times, I dare say this movie was DYNAMITE."
3,Not So Incredible After All,"I must say that I hardly ever go to the theater to see animated fare. I really don't enjoy sitting with noisy kids, and parents who refuse to keep their children under control. But that has nothing to do with this movie. ""The Incredibles"" deals with superheroes that have been deemed to costly by lawsuits to continue their acts so they are relocated to a hero relocation program. This is cute and really funny in spots. The problem I have is this film is too long. The middle sags with very little action and it gets a little boring. I even noticed the kids were a little bored. However, the ending is spectacular! The fight sequences are fabulous, but still can not make up for that sagging middle. This is not in the same league as ""Finding Nemo,"" Monsters Inc.,"" or ""Toy Story."" A good movie that could have, no should have been better."
3,"more ayn rand, less cinema art please","theres a problem with these pixar movies, from ""toy story"" forward, and its that they get so tied up in technique that they lose touch with their spirit. in the hands of scenarists like those behind ""team america"", the ayn rand inspiration could have been played up. here, it merely serves as plot vehicle. now dont get me wrong; ive enjoyed all the pixar movies. even the screenplays, which i seem to be criticizing negatively, are all professional. but if they want to ever make a great film, they should stop planning out the dvd commentary track while they are creating the story boards."
1,The Super Plagiarists,"I was so disappointed when I saw this movie. Not only it's not funny, and I thought it would be seeing the previews, but what pissed off most is that this is only a very pale copy of the Fantastic Four comic with the addition of Flash for the speedster. As I am a huge comics fan, you can imagine how disappointed I was when I saw this ridiculous movie. Not funny and irrating : do you want more explanation why I only gave 1 star ?"
1,Never again for me!,"I had to watch tthe incredibles with my parents at the movie theatre when it came out, didn't like it at all then. It was just plain dumb! Then months later, I had to watch it again at somebody's party. WHAT A NIGHTMARE! This movie is a real sleeper and it's a shame it was ever made! If there were zero stars as an opiton, I would definitely pick it! When I got home from that party, I was so mortified from having to watch that awful film, that I plugged in ""Funny Farm,"" to help myself forget about it. This movie should go out of print."
1,Incredibly stupid,"The Incredibles is a totally stupid animated film. The story is stupid, the voiceover stupid, the whole thing stupid."
4,The Incredibles,Thumbs up on this one. This movie was a cute movie. Both the children and adults enjoyed it and would watch it again.
4,I like it!,"As actiony as this movie is, my kids won't watch this. They think it's boring. Me, I kinda like watching all the crazy robot scenes, seeing all the superpowers, not to mention hearing Earl Hickey's voice all super high and annoying-boy-like. Not a bad storyline."
5,A brief comment,"The Incredibles is a fully-fleshed out and developed computer animated story that isn't just another summer kiddie flick. The Incredibles family members aren't cookie-cutter cartoon characters but real people who just happen to look like something out of a cartoon. :-) The intelligent and well written script won the writers a best script award and along with the amazing special effects they combine to produce the best animated film in many years. The action scenes are entertaining as well as spectacular, and after a while you hardly remember you're watching an animated film because the plot and characters seem so realistic and true to life. Overall a great effort from Pixar and they'll have to work hard to top this one."
5,a definite keeper,"Try to picture Brian Mulroony married to Mary Tyler Moore as spandex clad superheroes. Can't do it can you?!The animation is excellent but that doesn't come as a real shocker. What does surprise me is that this cartoon actually has a plotline and the characters have personalities that are (at least to some extent) more human than what most real life actors portray.I like saying bad things about movies. It's usually really easy to do too but this is a funny flick that isn't stupid, insulting or boring. There's lots of action, drama, laughs and of course the animation is fabulous... Definitely worth the price of admission!"
5,Mind Blowing!,"This movie was much more than I expected. The action is much better than what gets put out in action movies these days. Also, Pixar does it again by providing us with some of the best characterization in Hollywood today. They understand what really drives a story forward, and they keep you on the edge of your seat the whole time.Basically the story is that the Supers of the golden age of superheros must retire due to the threat of mounting lawsuits. However a threat brings back Mr. Incredible, but is he too out of shape to reclaim his former life as a superhero? Watch it and see. Kids and adults can both enjoy it. In fact, you don't even need to have kids to go see this. There are a lot of jokes for adults as well. This is so good, I'll probably see it a few times in the theater. Check it out."
5,Great Value,"We already had a copy of the movie that our 2 year old watched so much that it wouldn't play anymore. So we wanted to get another copy without spending another 20 bucks. I wasn't expecting alot for approx 7$7, but we were REALLY suprised of how good the condition of the DVD case and DVD were. Our son has watched the movie at least two times per day since it has arrived so hope this one lasts longer than the original. Thanks!"
5,Love this movie!,"This movie is ""incredible"". Loved it from the beginning to the end. Great movie for whole families to watch together."
5,Awesome for the whole family,"This movie is one of the best family movies out there. I'm not a big fan of cartoons myself, but this is an exception to the rule. My three year old son loves it and so does my 35 year old husband. We have watched it probably 10 times since we bought it and I haven't gotten tired of it yet. I can't wait for the sequel."
1,Great family movie,"I love to watch this movie with my grandchildren, they love it and I do too.Buy it you will enjoy it too."
2,Personal Opinion.,"I heard so much good about this movie so I decided to rent this online. We tried, really tried, to wach it - but only made 15 minutes and had to turn it off. Just not my thing - I am sure others love it."
3,reliable seller,"first copy of DVD skipped. i contacted the seller (had to pay for the return), and they sent me a good copy."
4,"Very good, but not Finding Nemo","This is a great movie - once again fantastic effects by Pixar, nice idea for a movie. Nostalgic but fresh concept. However, I do not think it matches up to the most recent Pixar blockbuster for the following:1. A little too adult at times. Kids get a little creeped out by some parts.2. Pacing. Slows down a little too much on parts then speeds along on others.3. Long term repeat watching. The superhero jokes just seem to get old.However, this is a lot better then most of the garbage out there, particularly with all the me-too cartoon CG movies.Worth a watch."
4,a good movie but that's it.,"ok first this movie is TOO hard to watch all the way through.I don't think there could possibly have been a movie to get distracted from!!! but why is everyone talking about it being SO great?? i think ""the fantastic 4"" was a better movie it had stuff happpening all the time, not just talking and talking and talking...and ON and ON. yuck!! if i wanted to watch a movie about people who just keep talking over and over i'd watch a movie like...i don't know but they just made it boring and then you jump really high over the action!! i esspecially don't like the ending!! but go watch ""atlantis the lost empire"" and there's blood in that one because at the end of that one the bad guy get sliced into pieces!!!!"
4,Grandma Approves,"I'm not a big fan of animation and wasn't completely enthusiastic about spending time watching this movie with the grandkids but was finally talked into it by the youngest one. Surprisingly, I found myself actually interested in the darn thing. Since one of my mantras to my kids and grandkids has always been 'family is everything', the INCREDIBLES struck the nail on the head in that department. I found the voices of the characters had so much to do with my enjoyment particularly the mother's. All in all, it's a movie that I enjoyed watching and will probably sit down and watch again."
5,The Incredibles,"It runs great on the new kindle fire HD! The kids can easily use ,watch, and enjoy. We are very happy with this purchase!"
5,Great Movie,"I love this movie. Good clean humor that I enjoyed with my parents and siblings when I was younger, that I now enjoy with my wife, and I can't wait to enjoy someday with my kids."
3,Just goes to show everyone has an opinion,"Well, I was really ready to love this movie. I just didn't. My family was actually bored. After many statements like, ""blah blah blah -- can't they do anything original?"" Folks started leaving the room. One comment was, ""This was highly recommended?"" But look how many folks really did love this movie -- so it must have something, right? What I did think was very well done was the outstanding voice characterizations. Craig Nelson, et al, did a fine job. I especially enjoyed both the art and voice (along with the writing) re Edna Mode. Also, I thought Syndrome was well done. So, yes, there were many good things about this movie (fabric and hair were perfect, too). But it wasn't the great movie I had hoped for. But then, I hated Shreck, so that may need to be taken into consideration. But I did love ""Finding Nemo."""
3,Only slightly 'incredible' for me.,"From seeing all these five star reviews here, I thought this was going to be excellent. I would not say this is the best Pixar film. I wish it would have been just as good as Finding Nemo was. I thought the animation was great, it looks real and the characters are cute..but I was slightly bored during some parts of the movie. This could be better, if I'm going to give my honest opinion. I can't see this as being a movie for kids all ages, either. It didn't strike me as such."
2,cannot beat toy story at all!!!!!!,"ok first i thought the movie was good THE FIRST TIME AND THAT WAS IT!!!pixar really took a nose-dive with this one and it should have been alittle more...i don't FUNNY right? i mean ok everyone else seems to like it but i thought it was boring the only people that i actually liked were syndrome and frozone but syndrome gets blown-up at the end...this is NOT how superheroes were when i was little at all. ok the goodguys and badguys fight ,goodguys win and badguy flies away saying ""i will beat you next time!!! hahaha"" but instead goodguy smashes him with a car!!! so i don't know why they even bothered with this anyway why not just call them the fantastics like they originally planned and forget it? oh yeah...where's the heart in it like toy story? a bug's life? monster's inc.? this movie does not have one the good guys are spoiled jerks the bad guys are sarcastic jerks. they also gave fantastic four a bad name, so why did disney and pixar even bother?"
3,sort of inbetween....,i do not hate it or love it..it's just sort of a movie you sit and watch for thefirst hour then after awhile move on to other thingsi guess if you liked batman begins then you'll likethis too but i sort of do and sort of don't i guess it depends onwhat kind of mood you're in right? so the story is definately 100% from spy kids andfantastic four...so it's a mixture and i liked the iron giant but this definately wasn't the director's best work...
2,State of the Art Animation but very old style of story telling,"Not everything retro is cool. I am glad a friend of mine and warned about this movie. So a young chap wants to be a hero and save the world, but is always shunned away by Mr. Incredible. The child is frustrated and and hence resorts to becoming a villan when he grows up. Haven't we come a long way, in ways of raising children. This should be atleast PG-13."
2,Don't Like It,"I don't like ""The Incredibles"". Wasn't funny or exciting, feels empty. Didn't like the trailer, didn't like the DVD. Feels like it's been done before. Surburban style and setting got me down too. Did like two of the special features on the second disc though, the computer glitch montage and the ""low budget"" Incredibles adventure and its commentary with Samuel L. Jackson as Frozone."
2,zzzzzzzzzzzzzz,"I was going to give it one star,but as i was falling to sleep after watching it i accidently clicked 2 stars and was too tired to change it back.I had to have alot of caffene to keep me awake.Oh man im going to have to finish writing this review before i doze off."
1,who needs a dvd for movie this old ?,"Whoever is buying the bluray version will hardly ever view it in a DVD. Maybe the DVD is more about digital copy but I still just want a single BD disc with this movie in it, priced about $16.Just as some other reviewers have mentioned, I'm so sick of these silly 4 disc set releases, esp for older movies at this price.I don't care for the special features either."
1,"Don't Hate It, but Disappointed","No DVD's in the package once it was opened. Amazon has no more available, so I had to go to Wal Mart and purchase yesterday. An inconvenience and two disappointed little boys on Christmas night."
3,INCREDIBLY OVERRATED!,"I really wanted to love this movie, but I found alotof it to be boring. So many people giving this movie5 stars, is insane! Not enough superheros in it forme, and Frozone was left out of most of the movie.They always do a great job on the animation, but thestory as usual, not so incredible!"
4,Where are the trailers?,"The movie, as you can read in all the thorough reviews, was excellent.I was very disappointed, however, to see that the various theatrical trailers were NOT included as an extra feature on the DVD's. The trailers were excellent--especially the one w/ Mr. Incredible's difficulty putting on his uniform due to his mid-life waist line expansion--and I fully expected to see them in this package.I found most of the extra features to be rather boring.But the movie is excellent...buy it for the movie, not for the extra features."
5,What's the hold up with blu-ray edition of this film,This film was released 6 years ago and no word on a blu ray edition yet. I'm seeing the more cutesy pixar films get upgraded but the incredibles is yet to announce a hi def version. I've seen the Hi def version on NBC every Thanksgiving so I know it already been done. So what's the hold up?
3,Too much explosions and violence!,"The film has too much violence and explosions which are not suitable for children, for that reason I would not recommend it."
4,eh only OK!!!!,"way too overrated a little too much fighting and what happened to having something called an ""origin""!!!! were they just born that way? bacause i thought you have to get bit,electrocuted,burned and everything else to become ""super""."
3,Okay for older kids,Movie was okay; but my two year lost interest after 20 minutes. Story line was a bit above children and there wasn't really anything in it for the adults.
3,the incredibles is tooo long!!!,ok first you HAVE to sit through two-two!! hours??i don't see little kids around 5-or 6 years old sitting through a 2 hour cartoon!!! oh brother it dosen't even get interesting until they do action scenes they should have taken it back shortened it and just cut more than they did and then maybe make it to 1hour or maybe 30minutes!!!it doesn't get interesting until the end then you wonder what happened!! was pixar nuts?
4,Awesome movie,"Movie is an great shape, but i thought it was going to come in the regular dvd box, which it didn't, but for the price it's still a great deal!"
3,The Incredibles,Another great movie for the family. It is about an animated super hero who has to make changes in his life and the struggle to be a good dad and family man. Great movie for everyone to watch.
5,And so much more,"Not only is the original movie as good as it was in the theaters, the additional items are as good as or better!"
3,cars last disney/pixar movie,they won't make sequels anymore except disney. pixar said they will be they're OWN company!!!! also it DOES seem weird that they copied the fantastic four but fantasic four is better infinity.
3,Not my favorite Disney film . . .,"I was disappointed with this one. I know, I know. Not all Disney films can be of the caliber of The Lion King. Still, I expected more from this one. It was cute and fun to watch, but there was absolutely no WOW factor. I know Lilo and Stitch was a lower budget film, but Lilo is far superior to this one. So is Mulan, another ""filler"" film. Of course, everyone has their own preferences, but this is just not up to Disney standards in my opinion. We bought it, and we've watched it once. It will be in the next yard sale pile."
3,Average... from Pixar,"Like other Pixar's DVD, it's good. But this one is little too... general, I think. Actually, I didn't hope a lot about this. It's sooo... average. Nothing so special in this story. It's like some other superheroes, fight crime, win, and... Ok, The End. Why don't they put something more creative? (Ok, The special powers is quite good) I think other Pixar's DVD is much more better than this. I'd rather watch Finding Nemo or Toy Story, or even Fantastic Four is better than this. It's little boring too. (Except for my little brother). Score 7."
5,Incredible,"It's just another great film by Pixar. Starts of a little slow, but it's needed for some character developement. Looks great and has a great soundtrack. PG so I'd bring older kids....adults will love it."
5,Awesome Family Movie!,Absolutely LOVED it! The entire family was able to sit down and we all enjoyed watching it to include the 2 year old who actually sat still long enough to see the movie!TWO THUMBS UP!
1,Consumer,"I didn't know what Region 2 had to do with the product, but where it came from keeps it from playing where I am located. It is useless to me. I think there should be an explanation if something is being sent from an area where it will not work in other areas."
5,Incredible Incredibles!,"I had zero desire to see this movie, but my nine year old talked me into it. I am soooo glad that she did. This is the cutest movie I have seen in a long time. I suffer through all of the children's movies for my children, but this one was different. Witty and fun. Highly recommended for children of all ages."
3,Fantastical and Mythological,"Based on the concept of the Roman/Greek Gods and our version of them in American Superheros, the only positive things I could say about this film is: I appreciate the message of the sanctity of Marriage and family - man, woman, and children - and I liked to see the growth in the characters when coming to terms with their talents and gifts. What I didn't like was the hedonism, which is unfortunately quite prevalent these days, in such an entertaining medium. Very good at suckering one into the mindset without realizing they've gone there. Case in point: if the baby had not become a demon at the end to escape the misguided nemesis, I might not have had as much of a problem with the film. Evil should never be portrayed in innocence to make it appear good. Another sign of our times."
3,ok,"I had to clean to heck out of the disc before we could watch it, but it was ok.The shipment came on time."
3,*yawn* i liked it eh sort of,it's just not great though i thought with all the hype it was going to be good but noooo it's not for me i enjoyed the fantastic four and spy kids more ALOT more than this.this one almost puts me too sleep everytime than there's exsplosions than talking another bad guy is killed talking on and on and on! i can't give it any higher or lower than this ok?
5,The greatest animated movie ever!!!,I loved this movie. Especially how they were even detailed enough to make thier hair and outfits wet when they get out of the water.
4,Koxson,"Not something I could watch over and over, but it was a very good movie. If Spider-Man 2 didn't also come out in 2004. Incredibles would have been the best superhero movie of the year.A job well done!"
2,*yawn* i thought i would have liked it more!!!,"""the incredibles"" is actually kinda boring i thought i would have ACTUALLY LOVED it but i don't. i don't know whether i should anticipate ""cars"" or not the incredibles is just too overhyped i think it deserves 1/3 of it's credit and spongebob deserved 5/5 of ""the incredibles"" credit."
4,Not one Of Pixar's Best,Coming of fthe heels of Finding Nemo one of the highest grossing animated films of all time it is no surprise that it is hard to live up to those standards.Pixar failed with Incredibles its not a bad movie its a very good movie but it could have been much better. Jus compared toi the other Pixar movies its not as good. This is also the movie that has Disney wondering if Pixar is out of ideas and gives them the question should we resign these guys.It is a great family movie and the animation is great as Pixar has done so well. So this movie is still worth a purchase even though it is not one of Pixar's best in my opinion.
4,it's good.,spider-man 2 and the fantastic four are much better though and the way syndrome dies doesn't seem like it could be for a DISNEY movie!!! but he gets hit by a car and flies into a jet turbine!!sorry but i can't take people just saying he dies the way he dies is very bloody but they don't show any blood except a bad guy gets punched and blood flies everywhere!! but syndrome gets it how i described it and then the airplane blows up into pieces!!!
4,"A movie for ""all ages""","I am a 17 year old boy, and i thought this movie was fantastic. The movie is just made incredibly well and needs to be recognized as a movie for ALL AGES. Because, as all teenagers know, when it says that it normally means small kids and parents. However, this has a lot of good stuff to say as far as the societal expectations of a family. Really good stuff."
3,it's OK...not the best one though.,"but i just wanted to say that there's a tiny bit of launguage in it not much but you just have to listen carefully because ""edna mode"" cusses and mrs. incredible does too."
4,No Review,"I do not review for anyone, it is alright for children to review for children. Adults do not bother. I do not want to benotified when someone buy films or books, I'm as seniur citizen at going on 76 so I do not play. Thanks."
3,Kind of boring.........But funny....................,I wasn't nuts about this movie but it was ok.I thought the professor was the funniest.This movie was ok.
2,Horrible Dubbing.,"I agree with Ignacio from Mexico, the dubbing in Spanish was so horrible I left the room and let the kids watch it, as it did just resemble a saturday morning cartoon. They obviously used the same actors that do kids cartoons and didn't hire more professional talent.I've loved the voice acting in Toy Story 1 & 2 and Finding Nemo in Spanish, and the voice acting in Spanish for movies like Shrek has always been outstanding, and equally enjoyable in either English or Spanish."
3,disappointing.,"After all of Pixar's other movies, and after seeing the trailer I was excited to see this movie. I was disappointed.It looked really nice, and it had some interesting ideas and some funny moments, but the story and characters didn't grab you as much as they did in toy story,finding nemo, and Monsters Inc. The plot seemed much to much like a re-hash of the spy kids movies too. Hopefully, Pixar's next outing will be more enjoyable."
2,The Incredibles,"If you saw this, imagine it without the music. It'd lose a lot. We have a cartoon family of superheroes doing what superheroes do. Damn impressive cartoon technology, but so what? They're never going to be as convincing as human actors. So what do we do with this technology? Move it to the fringes where acting isn't so important, like talking animals, science fiction, fantasy, superhero stuff. TERMINATOR II was an awesome use of the technology, but what else is it good for? This movie is good if you're too exhausted to do anything constructive, like thinking, but I doubt any adult will sit through it twice."
5,Some of these people just don't get it,"This movie isn't supposed to be compared to Toy Story or Monsters Inc. or Finding Nemo. It's an entirely different movie. It's a change of pace. Would you like it if Pixar made the same type of movie over and over and over until it gets so sickening everybody starts avoiding every new Pixar film? I wouldn't. I'm glad I was able to SEE what this movie was about. It's a change of pace. It's a different movie. It's an awesome movie. The story, the characters, the writing. Compare this movie to SPIDERMAN or XMEN or SUPERMAN or BATMAN!! ANY ONE OF THOSE YOU CAN COMPARE THIS MOVIE TO!!! Not Toy Story, not Monsters Inc. not A Bugs' Life. This is the best superhero movie ever made. It blends the best aspects of every comic book movie into one full package and perfects each and every one to make a brilliant and exciting superhero movie that I will remember as the best superhero movie ever made, not the worst sequel to Toy Story. Get used to variety. We need it."
5,Just watch it already.,"Brad Bird strikes again and more amazingly, didn't turn this movie into a franchise like plenty of those other animated things like 'Cars', 'Toy Story' and 'Kung-fu Panda'.It is in fact, one of those movies that adults will enjoy as much as the kids. Maybe more so."
5,Keep the songs out and the quality up there... Pixar makes Disney mean something.,"The Incredibles is bursting at the seems with personality and the emotion of the creators. If only a small percentage of the movies with real people seemed to have this much care put into them, we'd be seeing a lot better stuff. I still think of the scene where Dash starts running from Syndrome's henchmen and get a huge smile on my face. I think the movie is going to break apart into a million pieces from its own contageous joy and energy. This movie really is incredible!"
5,The incredibles (2-disc collector's edition),"This dvd is good for showing off to your friends.The colour, the quality of the video looks like High definition, are the goodies of this animated, PC generated dvd. AV magazines highly recommended this dvd, as one of the best dvd of the year. I highly recommend you to buy one when it is running out of stock from Amazon. The price is great!Kwok Lau"
4,"A fun movie, but not a favorite","This movie was enjoyable, but it did not hold my kids attention as other similar movies have. It is amusing and has a lot of action, so its a good movie for long car rides."
5,gift for mom,"I bought this book for my mom. She had brain surgery 3 1/2 years ago. Before her accident she was an avid reader, and loved American History. I bought this book for her, per the letters were short enough that she wouldn't forget what was happening in the ""story"", and I knew if she would be more likey to try reading more. Wow! She loves it, and her friends even read it when they come over. My mom is reading again, it might take her a half hour to read a page, but that does not matter. This book has change my mom, Priceless..."
1,disappointing,"This game is so bad, you can't even get started in it, the instruction manual has no information of any use, and the on screen help is nonexistent.Go for Reel Fishing 3 or earlier reel fishing games such as 2 and the original one if you want to enjoy a fishing game."
4,HARD TO PLAY,"MY SON FOUND THIS GAME A LITTLE HARD TO PLAY.HE LIKES IT OKAY BUT HAS A HARD TIME WITH IT.HE'S 9 AND LOVES FISHING SO HE WANTED THIS GAME BUT DIDN'T EXPECT IT TO BE SO HARD.OVERALL IT'S AN OKAY GAME,MIGHT BE EASIER FOR AN ADULT TO PLAY."
3,Okay...,"Rapala Pro Fishing is a decent game. The fish are realistic, and so are the lures, but the fish are either ridiculously easy to catch, or almost imposssible. I have been trying to catch a 50-pound King Salmon for 2 months and have not been able to. Also Rainbow Trout are very hard.And Catfish? Where? And I cannot believe there are no Northern Pike anywhere except the Danube Delta. Sheesh!If I could, I would give this game a 3 1/2. Just OK."
2,Not for anyone with (any) hand-eye coordination,"I'm an avid catfisherman and got this game for Christmas. It's the second fishing game I've owned (the first being Trophy Bass).Although the graphics are wonderful, the gameplay itself is miserable. Among the deficiencies: no onscreen help for the numerous keyboard keys, no explanation or control over the goofy flipping, unpredictable retrieve speed, no thrill to the catch, no lake map, no trolling... the list goes on.While they spent a lot of time making realistic-looking fish and lures, the game itself is pretty boring. I'll stick to Trophy Bass."
4,Not too shabby,"This is a fairly decent fishing title. My wife and I enjoy it. Some of the fish are pretty easy to catch while others...namely King Salmon...are dang near impossible to get in the boat. Sure we can hook plenty of them but getting them in the boat to win the tournament is another story entirely. I do like the fact that you can actually drive the boat unlike Sega Bass Fishing Duel in which you only use the trolling motor. I mean part of the appeal of fishing games is the ability to drive the boat. So leaving out that ability is frankly unforgiveable. But if you are a fisherman or fisherwoman or at least interested in fishing, then this game is worth a purchase."
5,"graham wayne,pa",This game is the best fishing game ive ever played. You can drive the boat. Stop and fish anywere you want. If you dont buy this game your missing out im telling you the truth.
4,Good Game,I've played this game before and it captures the sport of fishing very well. The only draw back to this game is only having lures to fish with. There are no jigs or other techniques to use for catching fish. Other than that this is a fun game and definatly worth checking out.
1,This Is Not A Book -It's A Pamphlet,I returned this book/pamphlet to Amazon as I felt ripped off. The price was so overpriced for a very small in size and only 100 pages. I read the other reviews before buying and some of them were longer than the book.
1,SUCH A CROOK,I have personally witnessed Shaw's law firm in action. They suck. I saw one instance where they took millions of dollars from my childhood friend and charged hundreds of thousands in legal fees for simply clipping coupons and for instigating problems of an already dysfunctional family.
1,HEARTWRENCHING RAGS TO RICHES STORY:,"I should have given this book five stars. Five for the amount of B.S. it contains. It never ceases to amaze me that in our modern society, the narcissistic people who are politically and socially corrupt, are hailed by themselves as hero's. Shaw confesses to having deceived his family for many years before finally writing his ""legacy"". What would make the reader now suddenly believe an admitted liar? I get the impression Shaw is still a ""Schmuck"" with a fountain pen"". Only these days, he and his law firm steal more with those pens than an army of gangsters with guns."
5,I Rest My Case,"My gosh, what an interesting and inspiring story, and an enjoyable, fast-paced read! I Rest My Case is the Jewish Angela's Ashes, although I enjoyed this more because there's a satisfying sense of closure as Shaw reflects on the challenges and heartbreak of his childhood and finds, by his journeys through life, the power to forgive and love. It's also a commentary on growing up during the Depression, the complexities and struggles of family life, and the sacrifices one must make to realize one's dreams. As Shaw contemplates his final sunset, I feel as he does that he has much to be grateful for, including those who caused him the most pain. Writer Peter Golden artfully paces the story and skillfully lets Shaw tell his story. I couldn't put it down!"
4,Worth reading,I Rest My Case is an excellent story for those of us who travel a great deal and are looking for something to keep our minds active. The story not only maintains your interest but it is difficult to put down even when the plane lands. Stanley Shaw's story is inspirational and demonstrates how great obstacles can be overcome. Well worth reading!
3,Fun and helpful book but...,"This book has a great do-it-yourself spirit. I enjoyed reading it, however, the information is most relavent if you are going to cut men's and children's hair. The book was written in the mid-80's and the women's styles are out-dated (men's styles are about the same) and the amount of material devoted to them is less than for men. Also, for some reason, the author chose female models who had very curly hair so the directions were difficult to see on them. As I bought the book to learn to cut hair on women, the book didn't meet my needs and so I rated it a 3.The author is very passionate about his subject and I appreciate his spirit. I wish in his next revision he would add more information about cutting women's hair and improve the pictures."
3,haircutting,"This book was very informative for the non professional. You will learn a lot about hair patterns and how to best cut it, however the actual styles in the cut-by-cut guide were very dated and unattractive. It helped me to understand hair better but I don't think I will be a better stylist because of it."
3,Lots of Detail for the Do -it-yourselfer,"I agree with many on the dated photos and the complexity of the text. This aside, the instructions will enable you to cut hair well without a bowl! A small investment in the book and reasonable amount of time will pay for many kids cuts several times over."
4,An instructive if a bit dated book,"I decided to learn to cut my own hair and amazon guided me to this book. OK, for me this book was not very useful since cutting your own hair with comb and scissors by looking into the mirror will be one of the most difficult things that you ever attempted. Yet, this book had many useful tips on how to proceed and I am sure if I try my hand on some other willing person's hair I will be able to do a decent job. The illustrations and styling presented in the book are pre-historic and could really use a bit of updating.My experiments with hair cutting my own hair produced such disastrous results that I had to shave my head completely to look sane. Now I am learning to clip my short hair with Remington clipper which also was found on amazon. Here after many disasters I have learned to coordinate my hand motion by looking into the mirror."
5,Recommended for beginners,This is a great book. Very helpful. I'd rather have my wife cut my hair now instead of going to salons or barbershops.
5,Great value,"As I am not a ""dummy,"" nor do I wish to cut the hair of ""dummies,"" I chose to add this book instead of others like it to my home's Y2K reference library. In the event of possible disruption of the current economy of hairstyling and haircutting, I wanted to assure that the hair of my family would be preserved from reaching abomination-before-the-eyes-of-the-Lord length. This book will give my family a definite survival edge, should that day ever come to pass."
4,A true story teller,"This man knows how to tell a story through his music. Just listen to ""Don't Take Kindness for Weakness."" You are pulled right into the train ride, practically sitting across from the woman. The CD also shows an arc of emotion and view point running from the bleakness of ""The Last Stand"" to the hopefulness of ""Crossroads."" This is an album worth owning and careful listening. I look forward to Paul Geng's next release."
5,Excellent for college students!,"I don't usually review products that I purchase from Amazon, but I felt this item needed to be.I bought this for my daughter for her college dorm bed. She absolutely LOVES it!Her first night there she told me her bed was more comfortable than her full sized bed at home.She also had a friend sleep over, and she let them sleep in her bed while she slept in herroom mates, who was gone for the weekend, and they didn't want to get out of it either.He just kept asking her where she got her bed pad because he wanted one for himself.I paid more than I originally wanted for this item, but it has turned out to be such a greatproduct that I am now buying them for every bed in my home as well.Definitely worth the money.This is a great product!!!"
5,You won't regret this.,"This is one of the best mattress toppers around for college students. It made sleeping so much more comfortable, and now I no longer get neck aches in the morning. And it's not too heavy either. It came with a free pillow too, so I didn't need to buy a separate pillow. All in all, worth every cent."
5,Silver Sentinel of the Spaceways!,"This toy is excellent regardless of what others have said about it. It is in fact super-articulated, and extensive play will loosen joints, but not much. It's great for display or play, and truly captures the look and feel of the Silver Surfer himself. Education is, well, give it a break it's an action figure, but it does include a comic book, and including something to read has to count for something in the education department, therefore, 4 stars for education. Overall, it's an awsome figure with very few flaws. Come on, a magnetic surfboard (done up with the same fabulous paint job of the figure), countless poses, and it's really the only good Silver Surfer on the market. Buy, play,display...enjoy"
3,Stay on the Board!,This toy is so cool. It comes with a display and Howard the Duck. I mean c'mon if a toy comes with another toy that's a duck it has to be good right? Wrong. Silver Surfer is very posable but he can never stay still on his board he keeps on tilting until he falls. The toy is fun to play with but he can at least stay on his board.
1,Far too expensive,"This is fine paper, but for the price I'd think it reasonable to expect more than a 40 sheet pad!"
2,Not very good,"Not terribly good, not a very strong flavor. Pretty bland and had the consistency of a soft jello. Inoffensive, but not very tasty. Color was reasonable. Tried spreading it on some bread, definitely wasn't going to be something I came back again to eat. In comparison I've typically purchased the foie gras torchon preparation, which is far more satisfying."
4,Pretty and relaxing and easy on the ears,"This is a very pleasant selection of music; ""Ah blessed Jesu how fortuned this?"" is particularly moving. It's nice and accurately performed without being particularly challenging to the ears; nice background music for falling to sleep to or writing."
2,"Very high quality, but does not fit the Rio500","Despite the fact that ""Customers who bought this item also bought"" Rio500 players, this case simply does not fit the Rio500. When the unit is in the case, it is impossible to access the volume control, and the strap on top prevents connecting the headphones. Too bad, because the leather and construction are obviously of very high quality. I won't hesitate to buy a Rio500-specific case from Diamond if they produce one."
1,About as Funny as a Coronary,"Over a decade ago, Andrew Silverstein was stretching his 15 minutes of fame as far as it could go with his tasteless comedy. He was selling out arenas, doing appearances on MTV and making a then high-profile appearance on Arsenio. Soon thereafter, the mainstream started to wise up and realized he's really just another sham, and he faded into obscurity. Here is the album that made him famous, and it's funny only if you're under 14 and happen to break out in giggles at the sound of the ""f-bomb."" People, I think this is as bad as it gets. I remember buying this CD out of curiosity in college. It was so disgusting I sold it the very next day and took a hot shower because listening to it made me feel so unclean. If you haven't already exposed yourself to the ""work"" of Andrew ""Dice"" Clay, there's no reason to do so now. He's a has-been and should stay that way."
3,THERE OK,"THESE WEE-WEE PADS ARE NOT THE BEST I HAVE EVER PURCHASED, BUT YOU REALLY CAN'T BEAT THE PRICE..."
2,Puppy pads,The puppy pads was a great deal put with shipping and they leak through it wasn't a good deal.Puppy pee on them two or three time it leak on floor so I had to use two at a time.
1,WEE WEE PAD REVIEW,I will NOT be reordering these pads. They are not a good quality and they leak right through the pads.The plastic coated bottom side is very slippery when wet.I will stick to the PET EDGE brand and spend the extra money for sure
1,Not good at all.,"They are very thin and the quality of absorbant side is like cheap toilet paper. Very disappointing. After $20 of shipping & handling fee added, they are not so economical either."
1,Did Not Receive,I am sure it will be a great product once I receive it. I ordered the procduct on APR 2 2007 and as of MAY 12 still have not received it.
1,"Bad Batch, not the normal blues","I have been buying these pads for my Maltese for 3 years now and they were always blue and absorbant and fine and this last batch I bought in September 2008 came all white and open on the ends and lets the stuffing out. Terrible and disapointment that I will call before I order again to be sure they are the blue ones as I suggest customers also do. As I said before, for 3 years I have used these pads from this supplier and never had a problem and got the blue backed ones and now they tried to pawn off a bad batch and probably lost a lot of customers. That is why you see such a wide difference in stars on this product in the reviews. If I were giving a review for the previous blue batch, I would have given it 5 stars. Not the 1 star I gave this bad batch of whitish ones. I think the company should reimburse us for these."
1,Inconsistent Quality Pads. Don't know what you'll get!,"Purchased wee-wee pads 3 times from this company (each time 3 boxes at a time). The first two times were fine. Quality was reasonably similar and acceptable. However, the last 3 boxes that we received were horrible. Not very absorbant at all. Won't buy from them again due to inconsistent products!"
1,THESE ARE NOT PUPPY PADS........,THESE ARE PADS USED ON ELDERLY PEOPLE WHO HAVE TROUBLE GOING TO THE BATHROOM. THIS COMPANY SHOULD BE HONEST AND LET THE PEOPLE WHO ARE CONSIDERING BUYING THEM KNOW THAT THEY ARE NOT PUPPY TRAINING PADS. PUPPY TRAINING PADS HAVE A SPECIAL SCENT ON THEM TO ENCOURAGE THE DOG TO USE IT. DON'T BE FOOLED!!!
1,Don't buy!!!,This product is not good at all. Doesn't protect anything. Doesn't absorb as much as they say.
5,Sold as it is described!,I will return to the seller if the price remains the same or even lower than what it is now. Great deal and great products! Thank you.
3,OK product,"These pads are OK. They are thin however, I haven't noticed that they leak at all. They should be changed as soon as they've been urinated on so that they don't leak through. I used them under my grandmother who wears a diaper and cannot get out of bed and I also put them down for my dogs, a 60lb Golden Retriever and a 30 lb Lab, in case they have to go and can't make it outside. Again, no leaks from any of them."
5,"Much cheaper than the regular dog pads, works pretty much the same !","So glad I somehow got directed to this product. We have 2 dogs and foster 1 that from time to time they would have accidents. The regular dog pads are quite expensive and are always advertised to have 'attractants' on them. I purchased this product for less than half of the price of the regular dog pads at pet stores. When they come, I couldn't tell the difference. In the beginning, I just sprayed the 'scent', but my puppies already know the use of it even without the scent. I don't really like to leave the dirty pad for more than 1-2 days, I don't really reuse it - so not sure the difference on the absorbance capacity. For my use, they both work the same - I can't even tell the difference. No more dog pads for me.... this product saves me tons !"
2,Flimsy,"These pads hold very little. I have had to use as many as three times the amount of pads that I have averaged in the past in a single day. Value: The low price most likely equals the greater usage needed for these pads in comparison to higher priced, less quantity brands.These pads were used for dog house-training of a 12 pound dog."
1,New vendor bad quality,"I have been buying the same disposable underpads for our dog for 2 years and the quality was good until this time. I saw that the pads were coming from a different vendor, they are really poor. I'll be looking for another source next time."
2,Poor Quality disposeable underpads,"I use them for Dog Wee Wee pads,this brand is not as good as others I buy.One wet spot and it spreads all over the pad and has to be replaced.Other pads I tried the dogs can pee several times on one pad before replaceing it."
2,Not for pets,"Not for dogs. The pads are the correct size but compared to most dog pads I've used these dont hold water. I have to use two layers of these pads where one of another brand would be sufficient. Understandably, these werent designed for pets and them directing their water host in one spot. Thats typically where it leaks through. I'm sure these would work for bed wetting, where the liquid is more distributed. Lesson learned, yet again, you get what you pay for."
1,Made in China?,"I have ordered from BP Medical Supplies before and the pads I received were fine and appeared to be from a medical supply house. Today, August 5, 2010, I received an order from them and would you believe the pads are ""MADE IN CHINA"" and as sorry as they can possibly be. There are many, many holes in the pads so how in the world could they keep urine from leaking onto your floors/carpets? They are thin, poorly put together, the absorbent part is so thin you could read through it. Cheap and inferior and certainly not worth buying. I would have rated it a ZERO but that was not available. Buyer beware!"
1,VERY DISAPPOINTED!!! Super Thin and NOT absorbant at all!,We just got a new puppy and got these pads. I am extremely disappointed as they are SUPER THIN!!! These wee wee pads are an absolute joke! I can't believe I wasted money on these! They are tissue paper thin.They don't absorb the smallest little pee from a a small breed puppy! (shih tzu!!).My previous pads he could pee multiple times. With this pad he pees once and it can't even absorb that! It creates a puddle that he steps in walking off the pad and gets the pee scent on my carpet due to it being on his paw.I have to throw them out! I can't imagine what they'd be good for as it doesn't absorb any liquid at all!
4,best for the price,these do not work quite as well as the actual wee wee brand pads. they're not quite as thick. fine for small dogs but i wouldn't recommend if you have a larger breed.
5,Very Good,"These are very good wee wee pads, also you can not beat the price. Also the delivery was very fast."
4,Great!,"Some pads were a little sticky. However, given the great price and good shipment time, I would definitely buy again!"
3,Not exactly what expected,"The piece fits into the dash fine, but the under stereo pocket is only a half inch tall and tapers towards the rear. Which means a standard jewel case sticks out halfway. Unless you want to store a half-used post-it-note then the pocket is useless. Don't be fooled by the picture, it's misleading."
5,Best R&B Band Ever,"A great recording from a great but neglected band. Streetwalkers, for my money, blew away the competition. The Stones sound like bubblegum pop by comparison. RED CARD is a fine recording, ""Run for Cover"" is a classic, and I'm glad it has been re-issued (finally!), but when will we get CD re-issues of DOWNTOWN FLYERS and VICIOUS BUT FAIR and the debut Streetwalkers LP???"
4,A must have for the Fiero enthusiast considering an engine swap or turbo.,"The book documents a father-son build of a very unique Fiero. They first replaced the 2.8V6 engine with a 3.4V6. They then experimented with various turbo configurations, and chip programming. Finally, they ditch the V6 and put in a LS1V8 with nitrous that puts out 508 horsepower. But, the real story is in the author's attention to detail. Wagoner documented every step, and includes many graphs and tables on weights, air-flow, horsepower, part sources and costs. The book also includes dozens of photos and clear wiring diagrams for mating an LS1 engine to the Fiero wiring harness. There are a lot of other tidbits of information on reducing weight and improving handling. (The book does not document the history of Fieros, or model variations) Well worth the $12.95 for the information I learned, and I have already made a few modifications to my Fiero as a result."
4,the best,"Im currently building a 3.4l v6 out of a camaro, let me tell you, this book has alot of information on that engine. when gm introduced the 3.4l it was performance oriented but not much thought when into it. not only does this book cover the 3.4, it also covers the orginal engine in fieros and as well everything there is to know about making your fiero unbeatable! great buy"
3,broke down also.,"Controller broke after one day also, like other reviewer. Not a battery issue. Will see what fisher-price customer service says. My son loves it, but if it won't work then its obviously not worth it."
1,Won't work for long,"This is one of the many GeoTrax engine I've purchased which has stopped working for no reason. They were working fine when I put them all away (with all the batteries removed, so no battery leak caused it). Out of six engines I stored, only one worked six months later when I got them out for my kids to play with again. I searched Mattel's web site for some sort of web based customer service to complain to, but as far as I can tell there is none.Save your money, buy a real train set instead. This is just overpriced chinese-made garbage."
2,Slow..Not sure it will last,"My son and Daughter have 3 trains for their set, don't know why but the other 2 (the one that came with the set and the Grey One) work well. This one on the other hand is about half as slow as them witch has the side effect of the other bumping into this one. At first I thought it was defective and had it exchanged at the store but the new one is just as slow. My advice is buy the Fire engine or another but not this one."
3,Broken after 1 day,"Like others, we gave a GeoTrax train set to my 2 year old for Christmas. It lasted about 24 hours before the locomotive stopped working properly. The product is terrific when it works properly, but it didn't work for us. Fisher Price is sending us a replacement engine and gave us a remedy for our problem, which didn't work. In the mean time, I have about $100 worth of stuff that my kid won't play with because of a faulty engine. I would also recommend rechargable batteries...if you have ""hills"" in your set, it will suck the batteries dry!"
3,material is thin,The material is thinner than the one I bought a few months ago and the color is just so so.
4,Runs very large,"I have ordered several authentic pigment sweatshirts. I love the colors and thickness, especially for our cold Ohio winters. I did not heed one reviewer's recommendation and ordered my normal size. These sweatshirts run VERY large. I ordered the next size down and still have plenty of room. All in all, these are great shirts, great colors, and great value for your money."
2,"Really, really short","Love the feel and thickness of the material. I already own three of the same sweatshirt in other colors, the same size. This one is a little smaller overall and MUCH shorter, only coming down to my belly button. I sent it back."
1,horrendous fit,"really, really, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, too too short.....made by and for small chinese people....this 18 word rule sucks"
2,Sleeves too short,Ordered and returned the 2XL size. The main body of the shirt was fine. The sleeves were 3 or 4 inches shorter than the XXL shirts of the mainstream brands.
1,Major problem,The shirt arrived quickly and is lovely. The problem is that I got a grease stain on it from a piece of food and can not get the stain out by any method. It is now a brand new house cleaning shirt.
3,Love these sweatshirts!,"I came upon this brand of sweatshirts (Authentic Pigment) sometime ago. They are all cotton and wash and dry extremely well. The cut is generous and the length is perfect (no hanging down to your knees like some!) But I have to say that the AP sweatshirts I have purchased in the past have all been made in Thailand, the new ones come from China. The new sweatshirts are not as heavyweight and the arms are about 2 1/2 to 3 "" shorter. I am so glad that I most of mine are the better made ones from Thailand instead of the newer ones. Just wanted to give everyone a heads up. I believe that some of the ""good"" AP shirts are still in stock some places but it is a gamble on who has the ""good"" ones left!!!"
3,Bigger than I expected,"The sweatshirt I bought has a great color to it; unfortunately it runs a bit bigger than I expected. It is too bad they do not offer this in extra small. It looks a bit big on me. I am going to have to cut and modify the length a bit. I could've sent it back, but it is a well-made sweatshirt, I will adapt to it and hope they create a smaller version."
2,color off,"I love the feel of this shirt. But I ordered the poppy color expecting to receive a red sweatshirt. Instead of calling it poppy, I would call what I received tangerine. If you like orange this color would be great. But I wanted red so I am really disappointed."
5,Entertaining sports history paperback,Nice clean purchase of a history of hockey's WHA. This paperbackwas a lot of fun to read. Got the book fairly quickly and enjoyed it.
5,wow what a book,"WOW, I read this book in just two days could not put it down.The stories had to be true because you can`t make this stuff up . Anyone who remembers the WHA or just loves hockey needs to read this book!!!!!!"
4,Good,"I too bought this compressor from Costco and it came with a finish nailer.I have used it extensively and am very happy with it. It isn't commerical quality, but it's perfect for anyone's home workshop/garage. Obviously it won't run tools that require huge volumes of air for extended periods of time. ie. you can't use a die grinder for minutes non-stop, but you can use a die grinder you just might need a little patience now and then.All compressors are loud, this one is no different. It does not run continuously, so get a longer hose and put it further away if it bothers you.The weight is exactly what you'd expect, for a 4g compressor like this. FWIW, I like the convenient handle to lift it with."
1,"If you want to read a book for sex scenes, then this is for you-","And if you want character development, don't bother with this one. The only character that is developed at all is Nick- and Nick could have been developed more. The characters were all lacking and after the non-affair between Nick & Trish ended, the book fizzled out too.By the end I was disappointed that I had taken time out of my life to read this book!"
2,Tacky Tale Told Tediously,"Davitt Siegerson's ""Faithful"" would have been better titled ""Unfaithful"" since that's the premise. We are introduced to the main characters of Nick and Trish who are newly married. The beginning engages as the joys of newlyweds are faithfully portrayed. Then Trish becomes unfaithful. The book devolves from there. The obvious sell here is the lurid sex scenes that pile one on top of the other (...) However, it comes across as extremely barren. All of the characters from Nick & Trish to ex-boyfriend Joe and abused sometime girlfriend Johnny are exceedingly trivial. None of these characters achieves any spiritual level of identification that gives a value level to the tale. Instead, the characters all have the mentality of bunnies, with my apologies to rabbits. Ultimately, Siegerson becomes trivial with this tacky tale told tediously. Taxi!"
1,dull as dirt,"Largely unreadable, I'm afraid. I was hopeful when I began, but Sigerson turns onto a turgid cul de sac: will he? won't she? who cares about these dreary people?If infidelity is your thing, I'd recommend Madame Bovary or Anna Karenina instead."
3,Not good enough for a softporn and film is too dark and slow,"The pacing in this theme is very slow. It seems that every scene was on slow motion with clasical music in the background. There are a vew good sensual scenes but the overall picture quality is too dark and makes you feel like you're in a dim light room. I prefer playboy softcore titles, atleast their music is uplifting. Also, the resell value of this dvd is rather low so dont buy it thinking you can resell it quickly. If you wish to watch a softcore title, find something else. This is a ""C"" average title at its max."
2,it is not all that,there is no sex at all if you like to watch some naked women walking around this movie could be OK
1,Not worth it,"The only way you can get hardcore porn is to buy it off of a porn site. I actually bout this at a dvd store and it wasn't worth it at all. They put pictures of busty women on the front and back cover and not only didn't put them in the video, they didn't put any very busty women in the video. There is only one good girl-on-girl scene out of an hour maybe more I dont remember."
3,I can do too,"is the best song on this soundtrack. the most low tone song that queen latifah has ever done I think. This soundtrack also features the works of Ness, Cubin Link, Santana with his song Olympic festival which I think is really cool, an edited version of the dilated peoples song, tracie spencer, Remy Martin and more besides.The movie too is cool I have heard, can't wait to check it out, it's on video now, has been for a while.bye everybody"
4,Pioneering synth-pop,"More interesting than critics make out, The Pleasure Principle offers a typically alienated world view. At this early stage of his career, Numan was, by his own admission, almost a non-musician and the song structures show this. His double-tracked voice is usually followed by a synth line, and the bass guitar often follows that too. The melodies are strong, but the arrangements are somewhat samey. Numan currently plays several of the songs from this album in his live set, but violently rearranged. Standout tracks: Complex, Films, Tracks and of course Cars."
3,"Get This Album For The Song ""Cars.""","This album for the most part is okay. Of course it contains the cool synth ride ""Cars."" That's a great song that you really can't tire of hearing. ""Airlane"" and ""Films"" are also above average songs with great synth playing. Besides the three songs mentioned, the other tunes sound mostly like filler. Not to say that they're bad, they just aren't standouts. Still a good album for the most part though. Give it a listen."
4,Life-changing,"Here's the deal: my sister played this ALBUM non-stop when it first came out in the '80s. We had just gotten a new kitten who slept in my sister's room. After a while, the kitten could only sleep when listening to Gary Numan. Which was great, because it gave us the time to dance out butts off to this techno-groovin' disc, plus the cat's been alive for nearly 18 years. Now if that ain't the goal of every musician......."
5,Synthesizer Perfection!,"Its very simple. Before this album, there was nothing. Like a universe that explodes from a single sub-atomic particle, this album spawned everything that ""synthesized"" alternative rock has evolved into. You must put this album in perspective with the time it emerged to appreciate the pure elegance of this work. Completely synthesized (sans drums), melodic, dark, cold, androgenous masterpieces - all. Every Depeche Mode, Nine Inch Nails, (pick your favorite synth band and insert it here) owes its inspiration from this recording. Sure there was Brian Eno, David Bowie, OMD, and others - but nothing as fresh as ""Cars"", ""Films"", ""Complex"".....If you like Gary Numan, you must own this album."
3,Henry's Daughter: A Mallawindy Novel 2,Henry's Daughter :A Mallawindy Novel 2 Thought it was a followon from first Novel but was a different story but i thought it was ok
4,Henry's daughter was a great read.,Thoroughly enjoy Joy Dettmans books.Can't put the books down and Henry's Daughter was no exception.Have read nearly all her books and waiting for the next one.
5,very under rated,"when i bought this album i wasnt sure what to expect but it turned out to be one of the freshest albums ive heard in a while and mayabe the best debut album since 2pacs 2pacalypse now or nas illmatic. Dope beats , dope rhymes, good production n great guests such as dmx,redman,method man,e 40,8ball,mjg,wc. with all that i cant understand why so few ppl know who jayo felony is to me he is 1 of the most original rappers around and unbelievebly under rated along wid canibus n xzibit.there is no best song on this album every song is a classic n to me its a classic the only reason its not considered a classic cos ppl dont know who jayo felony is i just cant understand it i hope he bllows up soon and gets the props he deserves.I recommend this album to any rap fan n i gurantee youll be shocked how under rated jayo felony is."
2,Not as good as i thought it would be,"This cd isnt that good, many of the songs are not worth listening. Probably the 2 worthy songs are nitty gritty and justice against yall oppressors which features e-40 & cube"
4,Jayo Misdemeanor,The album is definitely gangsta let's get that straight. Even with some eastcoast and down south guest appearances this still sounds like a straight up westcoast album. When I listen to Jayo I dont think San Diego but Los Angeles instead. But its whatever though. I think the Anita Baker remake is one of the hottest songs on the album as well as the last song on the album with Ice Cube and 40 water. But on side 2 (if you had the tape) there are like 3 songs in a row that is fast foward material. If you want to get some throw back Westcoast music then go get this album.
5,Best Nail Polish,"This color looks the best on nails. If you are looking for a great dark red, this is the color for you."
3,If only the fabric were better,"My little dog LOVES this toy, but I have had to sew it back together too many times. The first thing that comes off is the ""handle"" at the top. Can we make this strong enough for a dog to play with?"
2,Only good for little dogs,Mine lasted exactly 10 min before being destroyed by my dog.I have never seen him love something like that but it didnt hold up.Taree
2,Disappointing,"Pro: It looks pretty good (except for the hole in the diffuser) and isn't hard to install.Cons: It makes a humming noise when its on.I'm still bleeding from my struggle to put the rather fragile plastic diffuser onto the lamp - a 2"" square piece broke off (wear gloves and don't count on keeping the cover in one piece)This takes T8 bulbs, not T12 as the listing specifies. All in all, a major disappointment - I really needed a lamp of this kind in a lot of places, this was a test. Won't be buying another."
1,Booger likes Sailor movies,"Once again, I could not disagree with Booger (aka Adam from Columbus Georgia----see review below) more. This is a snotty, phlegm filled flick that is only good if you enjoy watching sailors in uniform (hence Booger's keen interest). This is a very poor man's Last Detail in a way, without good acting, stars like Nicholson, or much of a plot. Obviously, if you tend to enjoy what Booger enjoys, go for it. I see that Booger (adam) has now deleted his review of this and other favorites of his, after a few sailors ""roughed him up"" a bit and forced ol Booger to ""swab the decks"" so to speak. What a shame....."
1,unwatchable,"I can handle a lot when it it comes to goofy 80s flicks, but this is painfully boring, really bad, with no redeeming quality, unless your in the movie I would avoid this one at all costs."
4,Worked for me,Worked well for my project. I suggest to buy the Fellowes Thermal covers.Only problem I found is the thermal covers are not stocked in local stores.Order online was my only option.
4,"Great, informative, and quite enjoyable reading material.","This book is a great guide to parakeets, for kids who are about 9 to 12. Every thing you need to know on these interesting pets is simplified, and organized into neat paragraphs and sentances. It is just wonderful information, and would be a wise perchase for your child."
1,Marx meets Lord of the Flies,"I was interested in this book as a researcher on moral education and child development. Having just returned this book to the library, I'd have to agree with the first couple of reviewers. The work is essentially an essay dressed up as a study. It is a common pitfall to bash the ""state"" - that is forgiven. However, to suggest that to swing to the other side of the pendulum is a silver bullten is rediculous. Most will agree that purposeful programs of character education reflective of students environmental/contextual lives is what is needed. Any program worth its weight can work within a federally-funded program to implement effective character programs. The two authors (who *are* these guys anway) seem to have an axe to grind politically rather than to present a thoughtful history and contemporary narrative. Readers are best off to explore the literature on moral development/education. JP"
1,This album is complete Garbage.,"Well if you want to hear some really bad music then this album is for you. Corporate Avenger go for that shock appeal by hating God, the government, and cops.. However they don't have any lyrical skills to back up what they hate. These songs have crude and unpolished beats that sound terrible. They are nothing but white people doing a terrible job at trying to rap.Songs like ""The Bible Is Bulls**t"" are nothing more than shock songs with no real meaning other than to [make people mad], they don't really have any knowledge to back up what they say so they sound foolish and end up making Christianity look good. Boy do these guys make atheists like me look bad.If you want some good music with REAL meaning in their lyrics I suggest you stay as far away from this music. If you want some shock music just stick with Marilyn Manson because at least his lyrics are somewhat intelligent compared to CA."
1,new testament,As a born again Christian Corporate Avengers cd stinks. If possible I wouldn`t even give it one star.
2,Buyer Beware,"This is a really cute set and if they were durable, I'd give them 5 stars, but two of the clubs broke after no more than probably 6 uses. They were never thrown or used improperly, either. What a waste of money. I asked my husband if they could be duck-taped back together and he said no, the way they broke makes them irreperable."
3,Great brush tip but very uncomfortable handle,"I really love the brush tip on this toothbrush. It is very soft, large, and does a great job cleaning. However the handle is rather short and uncomfortable to hold. It's a rather big drawback and because of it I'm not sure if I'll continue to use this brush despite the great brush tip."
3,Textbook or Reference for someone on the beginning.,"I didn't buy this book and I'm glad I didn't. I'm not much of a textbook reader and this is definitely it. Contains basic details about things you should know but if you're really into skincare and have read too many books before this one, this is not the book for you. It should be for someone on the Skin Care 101 or someone looking for a reference book. So bad coz I'd really want to like it."
3,Good product - Bad technical support,"I have a scanmaker X6 with scsi. I like the product, but my scansuite does not work properly and there is absolutely no troubleshooting information in the scansuite pdf file. I logged on to the website and found very little technical support there as well. The error message I receive is: ""Unexpected error! Please quit scansuite then relaunch again. File: TW_Manager.cp. I believe it's probably a simple problem, as I can scan just fine through photoshop, but I will probably have to call long distance and possibly being put on hold for a long time to find the answer. I think Microtek could use a lot of improvement in their technical support on the internet."
4,Elegance on the Halifax: The Story of the Ormond Hotel,"I found this to be a very interesting history of the Ormond Hotel. However, it was not only a history of the Hotel, but also a history of the town of Ormond Beach.I was particularly interested in the history of the Santa Lucia Plantation. The log cabin, Talahloka, which is still standing, was my family's home in the early 1950's. A distant relative was also one of the owners of the Ormond Hotel.The pictures were superb and brought back many memories. It was almost a tearful moment to see the pictures of this beautiful structure being torn down. I wish it could have been restored instead of destroyed.This book answered questions that I had about the Hotel and it's history."
5,Best Latin Soundtrack,"This soundtrack brings out many of the Latin styles of music loved by us, the Latino public, as well as those who are not. The colorful sounds of my people's music: Rumba, Salsa, Cha Cha, etc., makes everyone get out of their seat. This cd enhances the movies plot and makes you feel the emotions the actors felt during the scenes. To make a long story short, este cd es un tributo a mi gente latina y es uno de los mejores que he oido!!!"
5,My kindom for Chayanne!,This is the best music ever. I went to see the movie and I was dancing on my seat! Plus the CD has music that i don't remember listening to on the movie. You will dance till you drop and then just want to savor the music from Chayanne and Vanessa's song. A must have! Para los que hablan espanol las canciones son todas muy buenas y le va a encantar.La cancion de Chayanne es para poner a cuarquiera a buscar una fantasia! Anny Hernandez
4,I lOve it@,"I thought that Black Machine Jazz Machine was really cool be it was on SO YOU THINK YOU CAN DANCE, YA WORK IT BLAKE!!!!!!!wE LOVE YA!~~~ YO YOU SHOULD OF WON!!!~~FROM A MEMBER OF DP,ka"
5,Great Music,"I thought this movie was so cute that I just had to buy the music. I'm no expert as far as this type of music goes, but I sure enjoy it. It's Latin and Salsa and makes me want to learn how to speak Spanish so I'll understand it better. It also makes me want to learn how to dance like they do in the movie. I think that's a compliment to their music."
4,Great movie = Great Soundtrack !!!,"Amazing soundtrack !A very good selection of latin dance songs.Too bad that the ""You are my home"" song in instrumental version were not on the soundtrack. (you can hear it in the movie when Chayanne & Vanessa are at the club for the second time) It's a very nice version."
4,Wonderful,This is a wonderful cd. Especially #5 Fiesta Pa'A Los Rumberos. It's great to salsa to! Enjoy. It's not a waste of money!-Jenna
4,Que buena musica!,"Esta cd es muey bueno. Pero, y piensa la mismo de los oltra personas. Los unas muy suave, son mala. Son bueno concions, pero son malas por esta cd de buena musica por bailar. Los oltra mas cds son perfectates por un fiesta or por manajas largos. This cd is great with the exception of the softer songs. I prefer those with the upbeat attitude like the one by Albita. I like her style. I highly recomend that you buy it."
4,Totally danceable!,"I think the soundtrack is better than the movie, which is certainly a switch! The movie I thought was a little less than inspiring -- while still being fun, I'll grant you. But the music was what made that movie more than anything else. Tracks like ""Magalenha"" which makes you want to jump up and dance! Or the incredibly sexy ""You Are My Home"" which inspires the sensual thoughts that all Latin Ballroom Dancing is about! Even if you don't see the movie, the music in this is worth getting, especially if you're all about dance!"
4,Almost perfect ! A 4.5 at least,"All you Latin music fans, like myself, will want to get up and groove when you hear this soundtrack! An awesome combination of modern, pulsing beats and more traditional music. I personally like the modern songs such as Jazz Machine, Jibaro, and Echa Pa'Lante better. Almost every song is enjoyable and fun. You definately won't be wasting your money on this one."
3,"Good function, poor quality band","Overall I have to say I like this watch. Have had it for several years now and I'm hooked on the radio update ""atomic"" timekeeping feature. My main gripe is the black plastic used on the band and case. About a year ago the band snapped. I've read somewhere they tend to get more brittle with age. The design is Casio unique so you cannot use an after market replacement band. And finding the Casio one proved to be VERY difficult. Finally found one and it cost about half as much as the whole watch. Liked the watch, so I bought it. Found it impossible to replace myself so finally had Walmart personnel do it for me. Now, just last night, the band came off. I thought the pin just snapped or came out, but one of the holes for the pin on the actual watch case broke. For affordability and function, I'll probably look at replacing this with the metal band version of the same watch."
1,Good watch - Bad case,"I have 2 of these watches. Like Turton, the band came off and I thought the spring pin broke. Actually, it was the hole on the case where the pin goes. BOTH watches broke in the same place - one after only 3 weeks of intermittent wear. Casio won't replace either of them because their claim is 'normal wear & tear'."
3,average casio w/wiz-bang option,"I would rate this as an average watch from Casio. Keeps great time, however has a very difficult time connecting to the atomic clock. I live approx. 50 miles from Wash DC, so maybe there is a lot of interference. Anyways, when it does connect it's dead on accurate. One other qualm I have albeit it's a small one (pun intended) is that the LCD display is too small and doesn't stay lit very long. Ok..Ok I know that's two qualms. The other functions come in handy for my line of work, so I bought it and I'm happy with my purchase."
3,"some good, some prosaic",The first few songs are standards and faintly boring. They are worth the wait to get at the absolutely superb songs at the end.
3,Linda Ronstadt - Merry Little Christmas,"This seasonal cd is good. It's not what you'd expect from such an artist as Linda Ronstatdt however, it is as good as what it is meant to be for; which is Christmas yuletide. She is much better than this, so don't let this one form your opinion of her. You've got to listen to the real Linda Ronstatdt recordings to do that!"
3,lose the chorus,"The beginning of this disc is very nice...very traditional...on the 2nd half of the CD, one might as well be listening to a generic chorale recording. Linda has too much to offer to let her voice fade into the background. Maybe she should have ended the disc earlier."
3,"Some Of The Tracks You'll Love - Others, Well....,","I find my assessment of this CD ranges somewhere between the reviewer who gave it one star to the one who assigned four. The opening four tracks are, quite simply, some of the nicest renditions of those four classics you will find anywhere.After that, well, as one reviewer accurately states, her marvelous voice becomes swallowed up in chorale arrangements. Also, I don't know about you but I never did particularly like Christmas compilations that offer up obscure selections [tracks 5, 7, 8, 10, 12, 13 in this instance].In lieu of liner notes what you get are the lyrics to each selection, along with names of the composers and details of the backing artists/chorale groups.For the most part we only haul these out once a year for about a month, and in doing so I think most of us like the familiar tunes done by our favourite artists. I was a bit disappointed."
5,Not disappointed!,I had it narrowed down to Linda's and a few other worthy selections for my choice of Christmas music. I was definately not disappointed. She still has a beautiful voice....
4,"Very good effort, but not a classic","I really agonized over this review. Don't get me wrong. Linda is in excellent voice, but there was just something missing here that kept me from giving it 5 stars. The CD is arranged somewhat like an old LP. The first five song are secular and lushly orchestrated. Then on song 6 there is a stark changeover to religious choral music. The music is beautiful and is certainly in keeping with the season. I suppose I'm just disappointed that Linda didn't use this opportunity to give her fans a little more variety. The hallmark of her career has been her versatility and I wish she had displayed more of it on this CD like Linda Eder does on her recently released Christmas CD. That said, it is still a very good CD and an excellent addition to any Christmas music collection."
3,Not my favourite.,"I love Linda Ronstadt, and grew up listening to her music. However, this is not a cd that I often pull out come Christmas time.I can't recommend this from my own tastes."
3,pain but it works,"I usually have to fiddle around with it a for a while before I get the fuel lines to pop off, but it does do what it's made to do."
2,Sucked in by the cover.,"Since this book is all about the photographs let the buyer beware that every photo contained herein was taken at either a British or an Irish racing circuit. If you're looking for photos from Monza, LeMans, Morocco, Germany, Belgium, etc you will not find it here. To say that the photos are decidely amateurish and lacking in quality and originality is an understatement. To be fair, I blame myself for not reading the product review more closely and carefully. Save your money until ""Formula One in Camera 1950-59"" is produced."
2,Overall disappointed,"From a distance, this sword is a nice piece. But when I took a closer look, I saw that the top section on the scabbard was loose and could easily slide off. The green paint was also chipped around this ""broken"" section, as well as completely chipped off in other places. The red jewels are nothing more than plastic (a soft plastic). The blade itself is all right. Not loose at all.For a costume piece, this sword is perfect. But for a collection, I'd say skip this one."
5,cool lion sword,this sword i got for my mom for christmas she loved it so this sword is good for any collection
5,Spartan: Total Warrior,I don't know what is with some of the people who wrote reviews for this game. They over analyze the game is just plain fun
4,awesome game but not compatible with xbox 360,This was one of my favorite games from the origonal xbox. I was really excited to get it and play it again but found that it is not compatible with the xbox360. It was a let down but i should have looked into it before paying the money for it. Just to give warning and help keep others from making the same mistake. This game as of now in october of 2010 it is not compatible with xbox 360. just incase a new update comes out sometime soon to fix it.
3,wrong mellow,"this isn't so much a review as it's a warning. this is not mellow as in the french electro-psychedelic group. the one that did the soundtrack to CQ and worked with Air, etc...this is a different Mellow. it's okay. not exactly what i would have gotten myself...there's no real info here, so i wanted to offer some guidance. amazon is lacking information for both mellows."
2,beware of low expectations,"The authors state that a C average in school is OK as most of us are around average in our abilities. Obviously (statistically) we are. The problem with this is that a C, a 2.0, is not average in school. The average GPA was 2.68 in 1990, rising to 2.94 in 2000, and to 3.0 in 2005. (National Assessment of Educational Progress) Thus if your child is getting all B's, he or she is average and maybe you can relax. A child with C's as typical grades is decidedly not average--all the more so because such a child is probably taking the most basic level of classes. Maybe such a child is doing the best he or she can, in which case fine. But don't be fooled into thinking that a C is average and is OK if your child is not working up to his or her potential. A C means that your child is way below average.I found this attitude of having very low expectations to be all too prevalent in the book."
2,just OK,"I thought this book was just OK. Much of the information was good and I will use it in our home. However, the examples they used in this book were outrageous. Who in this day and age is going to let their kid off to walk home. Also, allowing a child to determine whether they go to school or not is silly."
1,More damaging to relationships than spanking,"All you need to read is the section on spanking, in which the authors brag that children often beg to be spanked instead of subjected to the parenting techniques recommended in this book. The authors seem to regard that as a selling point, that their techniques, just like flogging or waterboarding, are viewed as even worse than spanking by the victims.If you're still considering this book, please imagine a situation in which YOU were begging someone, ""Please don't do that to me! Anything but that! Please hit me instead!"" Would you describe that interaction as part of a loving, respectful relationship?Read Unconditional Parenting by Alfie Kohn for parenting techniques that support loving, respectful relationships."
1,"Good idea, to much Religion","Good idea for a book for parenting, with great examples and ideas. But why so much bible and GOD talk! Makes not sense, really ruins the book in my opinion.Parenting With Love And Logic (Updated and Expanded Edition)"
3,Not as great as the original but a good read,"This book was not as good as ""Parenting with Love and Logic"" but it is still a good read on how to handle teens. However, if I were going to buy only one book - I would buy Parenting with Love and Logic instead."
2,why spanking,"I think many of the techniques in this book are worthwhile. I was shocked, however, to find that the author advocated spanking, qualified it with an age restriction, and added rules to follow - one of which is ""spank only if you can do it in a painful way"". There are many ways of removing a child from a situation to teach them what is unacceptable, or dangerous, behavior. There are usually reasons for the behavior. Often they are just having trouble communicating. As a parent of an almost two year old I couldn't imagine ever hitting my own child. I can't think of anything it would teach him except that hitting is okay."
1,Curious book,"Never mentions the word ""praise"".Oddly tells you merely what other parents do for tantrums. No real grounding in any evidence. Lame. The author is unaware of all the evidence-based parenting techniques that are known to work because of scientific research. Weirdly obsessed with moving the location of the tantrum, maybe because he knows he has no useful advice. Don't move a kid having a tantrum unless you have to. Check out the Kazdin Method book if you have behavior problems deal with.Of course, logic is a field that deals with the form of arguments independent of evidence, so at least the book lives up to it's title!One thing I liked. The author mentioned that teens often make bad choices because they are the first choices they are ever allowed to make. Good idea to let younger kids make choices, have some autonomy."
2,Half Baked Logic,"There are some good ideas in this book about how to be a coach and be consultative with children but there is an equal number of very bad ideas in this book. Some of the ideas suggest that parents will get an outcome that is totally absurd and makes me wonder if the authors truly have kids.This book will appeal to parents that want their kids to feel good about themselves even when those same kids do bad things. However, the country already has a couple generations of children that demonstrate this strategy does not result in responsible adults.Parenting is an active, participatory sport that requires parents to be ON THE FIELD playing their role. Parenting is NOT an armchair discussion from the sidelines."
4,"When you need help, this book gives you hope.","Unfortunately, you have to wade through a lot of self promotion of the concepts in the first half of the book. There is some help there, but you have to wade through tired old stories to get to the gems if you are already familiar with love and logic. The second half of the book ""parenting pearls"" is helpful, but I wish it had more scenarios."
4,Overwhelmed with too much parenting information?,"Parenting doesn't have to be an ongoing and overwhelming struggle. You can raise remarkable children who are capable, confident, responsible, and compassionate. You can have a family that is connected and resilient. Parents are often overwhelmed with too little and then too much information. Parents worry that they are losing control over the influences on their children. They struggle to balance the demands of raising children in today's fast paced, high pressured times. Parents experience conflict over differences in parenting styles and pressure from the advice and expectations of others.This book offers some great information. When you've found that information is often not enough, parent coaching can help."
4,Great book!,"I haven't read the whole book yet, but the pieces that I have read are fabulous! I love that it has short sections so that I can pick it up and read for a few minutes before an interruption. The only draw back for me is that the cover is not as it was advertised in the photo. It's a solid fabric color like back in the day, but I can work with that. Thanks for the help in getting this well written parental aide to me!"
2,Parenting With Love and Logic,"The book contained some good solutions for the problems encountered while raising children. However, some of the solutions are more idealogical rather than realistic. As is usually the case with advice given by other people, some of the advice is good and should be followed and some of the advice is not good and should be ignored. It is up to the parent to determine which of the solutions are practical and which are nonsense. For example, letting children suffer the consequences of making bad decisions without parental intervention will not always work. Letting children go to bed late one night will not cause them to always go to bed on time after that. They will continually stay up late, sleep at odd times and therefore, be constantly tired and grouchy."
4,Very informative,"This book is definitely worth a read, since it gives parents options to consider when faced with the typical challenges of parenting. The basic premise is that good parents teach children to use their minds in order to make decisions, and that by allowing them to do just that with everyday, small issues, they'll be prepared to handle the big decisions later on. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is trying to consciously parent their children!"
5,Good Ideas,This book has some good ideas regarding raising your children. One of the main ideas is to let your child have more responsibility and make more choices when the consequences are minor. They will learn from their mistakes without much harm and become better thinkers and become more responsible.
2,Please remove Christianity from this book.,"I like the ideas behind this book and I try hard to look past the authors trying to force Christianity down the reader's throat, but sometimes it's hard. Citing God and the Garden of Eden as if it's fact and has anything to do with good parenting is offensive to me. Many times I have wanted to put the book away and never pick it up again because I do not share Christian beliefs. In today's world with all of the various religions and beliefs, I feel that the authors of this book are pushing away potential parent readers by focusing so much on a single religion. Each chapter even starts with a quote from the bible. I highly suggest that the christian element is removed from this book in the next version and I'm sure that your messages will reach more readers."
1,Parenting teens,"Being a parent of a teen for the first time, I was looking for some insight. I had heard many good things about this book. As I first started to read it I was greatly disappointed. This book strongly advocates lying to your children and being passive aggressive. If we are trying to teach our children good values and help them be adults of good character this book is unacceptable. I expect the same values in myself that I do in my child. If I had to resort to being maniupulative and lying to raise my child I would be very disappointed in my parenting skills."
2,It was so-so,"I found the book had some ideas that helped, but it was unrealistic in many ways. I am spiritual, but I didn't appreciate the religious opinion it gave."
5,Great!,"I just received it in the mail, and I'm excited to start reading it; probably when I finish out this quarter at school!"
1,Good idea for communication,"This book is another liberal approach to raising teenagers, but it does have some good ideas about communication, i.e., asking questions rather than giving orders. The writers espouse no punishment because the child doesn't get punishment in the ""real world."" The examples of handling situations with teens include, ""What to do when the police call and have your son in jail."" Most teens discussed are in serious trouble and have poor relationships with their parents. The kids are in charge in these households, not the parents. (The parents never read, DARE TO DISCIPLINE!) If you are desiring to improve relationships with adjusted children, this book is not for you, even though the writers have a few good ideas."
4,Good Info and practical,"I have been using the Love and Logic strategies for 5+ years. This book offers solid, practical advice."
4,Common Sense Thinking,I really enjoyed this book. My brother-in-law is a first grade teacher and highly recommended this book to me. I found it very interesting and will definately use a lot of the skills in my parenting. I am trying to change my ways of thinking- It will take some practicing. I was raised totally opposite. I think it is wonderful b/c it teaches children that there are consequences to your actions and it teaches parents to let their children make mistakes.
1,Sick authors,Any author who presents themselves as wanting to help children and then advocates corporal punishment is a sociopath at worst or terribly misguided at best. They should never yield power over someone smaller or weaker than themselves. Maybe the authors need to be physically bullied (ex. spanked) by someone 100+ lbs bigger than them so they can feel what a child feels when some stupid or gullible adult follows their advice. Do unto others as you would have them do unto you. Parents and caregivers- please think long and hard before you hit the children who are depending on you for love and protection. There are much better ways of discipling children. Learn them.
2,I was disappointed.,I wish I would have never purchased this book. I was disappointed in the lack of alternatives to spanking and the suggestion to spank such young children.

5,Big help in short amount of time!,"In July of this year I purchased this book to help me out with some small issues I was having with my 14 year old daughter. I since have found that my 13 year old benefits from some of the ideas and advise listed in this book as well. It is taking me some time to read the whole book because I find myself skipping around to deal with each issue as it comes up in my home. I have since recommended the book to my x husband as I see that it would be useful for both of us to be using the same method when it comes to the need to disciple or not. Some of the ideas have shown me that my 14 year old has so much to learn before she is ready to take on the major decisions in life but we are working through each ""mistake"" as they take place. I have learned so much and can't wait to actually read the ENTIRE book. My children will most likely thank me later! Thank you for making this book available to all of us who are asking for the ""teenage"" manual :)"
5,The best book for parents raising teens,"Whether you have troubled teens, average teens, or great teens, this book provides a plethora of answers for parents with questions about being the best parent they can be. The love and logic program teaches parents how to love their child by taking care of themselves and by allowing their teen to suffer real world consequences. The book is half instruction and half ideas and suggestions for resolving common teen problems such as parties, friends, drugs, sex, backtalking, etc. I'm going to make it part of my permanent library."
1,For More Info,"For anyone who is interested in learning more, Google the author's name: Foster Cline and Rage Reduction Therapy. What I found was sickening."
5,A must have,"This book is a must have for any parent. Really you can just throw away all the other non love and logic parenting books you have. This one does the job that well. There's a reason teachers use Love and Logic in their classrooms - because it works. You can even try this one thing today, before you even buy the book - start giving your child choices (where you are fine with either choice). Would you like to wear the blue shirt or the red shirt? Would you like to wear your coat or carry it? Would you like milk or water with lunch? I promise you will see a difference in your child immediately!! They will feel more in control, they will be happier, and when it's time for something to happen that isn't a choice (time for bed!) they will be more willing to cooperate with you. Try it! Then buy the book, so you know how to handle any situation! You will be a cool, calm, in charge parent who knows how to handle their kids. More importantly, parenting will be what it's supposed to be: FUN!"
1,This book and the author are dangerous,"The American Psychological Association has issued a warning against this book and the author. The author has been banned from practicing and doing his seminars in Colorado and other states are looking into his criminal and civil law suits that are pending against him. In one case, he told a 300 pound woman to sit on her toddler child as he was having a temper tantrum. The woman ended up killing the child. The book is filled with bad advice. Previous versions of the book included how to spank your children. He has been quoted as saying, ""the nerve endings of the brain are in the buttocks - that's how you stimulate it."" I don't know about you, but I don't get to use any of the ideas created by a man like this."
1,bad advice and religious,"This book is useless. I, like another reviewer, elected to recycle my copy, rather than sell it used and risk being responsible for someone actually following the crazy advice in here. The suggestions are unloving, irresponsible and not practical. This is also a Christian book, with a whole chapter about how to get your child to like going to church. The chapter opens by saying that all responsible parents want their child to go to church. This book is weird; don't buy it."
4,Good addition to a parents library,This book has lots of good ideas and ways to implement them. I would recommend reading this book and taking one idea at a time and see if it works for your child. In my teaching career I found many of these principles worked like magic in the classroom. And to be honest I was skeptical!
4,This book has helped me with my three year old.,"Although a lot of the situations and solutions are geared toward older children, I am glad I found this book now. My son is three and already I find myself involved in power struggles with him. This book has given me an effective way to deal with it. The idea of giving kids choices may seem ridiculous, but it really does work. Now I feel I'm on the way to having a better relationship with my child and am preparing him for the future. I recommend the book to anyone with kids."
2,"ok, but not for me","This book came highly recommended to me. I was very excited to get it. I am a preschool teacher and a mom. The whole tone of the book turned me off. Although I come a background the authors approve of, I found the mention of God and specifically Christianity as the best way to teach Love and Logic simply offensive. I tried to get past my discomfort but found I do not live in the same world full of tests for my child. Teachable moments are great but we must teach for the world we share with all kinds of different wonderful people."
1,Don't waste your time and money,"This book was recommended and is used in a class supporting foster parents in my community. I found its recommendations to be punitive; e.g. suggesting spanking which must cause pain, for children under three. The suggestions of things for parents to say to their children are often sarcastic or even snide sounding. The discussion of the fundamentals for younger children is called ""Basic German Shepherd"" and the authors start this ""training"" at 9 months. And for me there is much too much religious content. I was appalled."
4,Great advice,Great suggestions for handling common issues with parenting. I'm the typical helicopter mom and needed to quit crippling my children by protecting them and doing everything for them. After reading this book I feel that I have new skills of communication to help me. I plan to reread it to continue to enforce what I learned.
3,Book supplements courses and seminars,"After reading this book cover to cover twice, I was still left asking ""But what about MY kid? What about when this doesn't work with my kid?"" Search around (try asking at your local public schools) for Love and Logic parenting classes. It is well worth the time spent in discussion with a trained L&L; instructor. You can ask all those specific situational questions the book or the website don't address.As for the other items in the series, I have only heard the Parenting your Toddler with Love and Logic audiotapes. I thought the age-specific advice was very helpful. We listen to the tapes and read the book regularly because we always need brushing up on the technique. There should also be several of these items at your local library. Check it out before you spend the money if you want, but we think it's well worth it."
1,They get one star for spelling their names correctly....,"This book should be renamed, ""God and illogic"". I was raised in a ""christian"" home where routine punishment was getting hit by a ""switch"". If you don't know what that is, you are lucky. This book is not far from that type of southern ""christian"" behavior. I will get my advice elsewhere."
2,there are better options,"There are good ideas here, but in many cases poorly executed (as per the examples in the book.) I whole-heartedly agree with the reviewer who has the ""best critical review"" on why some of these examples ultimately steer children in not the best direction. I feel a better choice with safer long term lessons learned by your child can be found in Connection Parenting by Pam Leo."
4,Parenting with Love and Logic,"Wish I had this book 10 years ago before my youngest children were born...or even before my teenagers were born! Simple, easy to use methods to interact with your children that don't involve yelling (or even raising your voice). The hardest part is getting rid of my old habits in order to incorporate the ones from the book that actually work! This book has been a Godsend!"
5,great book,If you're a parent this is a must have book. It picks up where the first book left off and gives wonderful insight and helpful hints into helping and holding your children accountable. I will I had this years ago it would have been so helpful. I highly recommend this book to all parents.
2,"Too much ""marketing""","Too many sensational stories in here, many of which spend more time condemning other parenting methods and not enough time talking about the methodology itself."
4,Grandparenting tips with Love and Logic,Our grownups children who are now parents were surprised by our updated grandparenting techniques. After their visit I presented each of the parents with the book. They were tickled and able to blend the parenting tips from the book into daily use.
5,Who would of known??,"I have a 13 year old who I admire for her assertive, ambitious, and yet nonchalant behavior. She's a sweetheart, well that all changed when she hit the 7th grade. I instantly lost my train of thought with the newfound obstacles that were coming my way. This book helped me get back on track by remembering the most important concept in all relationships, ""Love."""
4,Informative and helpful,"This book was helpful and informative for us. We always need extra help and good ideas, this book offers both. We have seen a change in our child too, as we offer more choices and love to him."
1,"""CLICK TO LOOK INSIDE!"" CONTAINS MISLEADING AND FALSE INFO!","WHAT HAPPENED TO ""DISCIPLINE 101 (BASIC GERMAN SHEPHERD) -- AGE ELEVEN TO EIGHTEEN MONTHS PAGE 136?"" AND ""DISCIPLINE 201 (REMEDIAL GERMAN SHEPHERD) -- AGE FOUR TO SIX YEARS PAGE 139??"" I BOUGHT THIS BOOK LOOKING FORWARD TO READ THOSE PAGES. WHEN I RECEIVED THIS BOOK, IT'S NOWHERE TO BE FOUND IN THE BOOK! BEFORE PURCHASING, I LOOKED OVER ""CLICK TO LOOK INSIDE"" AND IT'S LISTED UNDER THE TABLE OF CONTENTS! BUT WHEN I RECEIVED THE BOOK, THE TABLE OF CONTENTS IS ABSOLUTELY DIFFERENT! I HAVE NEVER THOUGHT AMAZON WOULD POST SUCH MISLEADING AND FALSE INFO!"
4,Very insightful,"I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. As a new parent any insight into the mind of a child is greatly appreciated. Although I probably will adapt my parenting styles to what fits, because every child is different. All in all a very interesting and insightful book."
4,Great book for parenting,"Love the book. Neat ideas and suggestions for dealing with ""issues"" with kids. Also includes several references to scripture."
1,ha ha ha ha,"I was going to buy this book because it was so highly recommended by Dr. Phil among others. When I checked the reviews at amazon books I decided it would be safer to check it out at my local library and I have to say THANKS FOR THE WARNING. This book was so bad I wanted to throw up. Who would raise their kids like this. Why would you want to make food a control issue and teach your kids animals are disposable. Whats up with the spanking. Why would you beat your own kids! Honestly, it might work but so would hitting them over the head with a 2X4. We are their parents, surely we can do better than that!"
2,2nd and 3rd seasons have these episodes included,"What's included on this DVDFour episodes: Astrobiology, Space Travel, Colonizing Space, Living in SpaceWhich are taken from:Second SeasonEp 7 -AstrobiologyEp 8 -Space TravelEp 13 -Colonizing SpaceThird SeasonEp 7 -Living in SpaceThis is to help anyone who is going to buy or has already bought 2nd and 3rd seasons and is unaware that these are taken from those seasons. Which of course I didn't and was trying to figure out."
5,the purchase an was good idea,this what i always wanted for my collection of DVDs for the Universe I thank you
5,Amazing!,"I love this figure, mainly because og the detail of it. The head sculpt is vey cool making him look really strong. The figure is very big which shows of his power. The articulation on this figure is very good, like all the other marvel legends. The paint on the metal is very nicely done.The base is a part of a sentinals body which is cool, the base is very detail and looks amazing. For that price you cant go wrong!!! Get this figure its 1 off the best."
1,MISSING DUST BOOT,"Make sure you open the package and inspect the part first. The part I got was correct for my model truck, but it was missing the dust/grease boot. It also was different than the part pictured. I was sent one of the tie rods that come pre-lubed and cannot be lubricated. The picture depicts a grease zert type. Did not come with the nuts or cotter pin. I unfortunately had to track down a new boot as I had already removed the old parts and just didn't have the time to return it."
5,Fluted bit,"Very impressed with the ease of cutting the small fluted bit demonstrates when working with hardwoods. I was skeptical due to the 3/32"" size but it preformed beautifully."
5,waynes wood shop,"The 1/16th & 3/16 bits i recieved were of the best quality hardness, and did a supper job."
5,Couldn't put it down,I was glued to this book from beginning to end! Wow! Just what I needed to spice up my own sex life. I have since read more of her books and look forward to the newest. If you like fun and fantasy get ready for action!
1,Wish I could give this 0 stars,"I can't express how disappointed I am in this book. I like spice in my romances, but this one just made me feel dirty. Can I have my money back, please? At least I now know to stick with Beatrice Small's historical fiction."
3,Hit and Miss,"I wanted to like this book as several friends had recommended it but I just really couldn't get into it. I don't necessarily need a HEA, especially in erotica but this wasn't erotica either.Whether it's erotic romance, erotica or whatever, I need to be able to like the main character and Nora was likeable for a while but by the end her change of personality was neither likeable nor believable.The sex was all right, some of it was downright hot, the premise of the story and the idea of the Channel was interesting enough although I liked it in Videodrome better.All in all, I walked away annoyed and not convinced of much, I thought the dialog was stilted in many places and the character development was weak. I have liked some of Small's other works but this one really wasn't one of them."
4,I want that Cable channel,"I loved this book. The cable channel portion was exciting, but I also looked forward to what was happening in her real life. The end was quite a twister. I am more the romance novel type reader, but this book came highly recommended to me and I thoroughly enjoyed it."
2,Disappointed Fan,"I was very disappointed in this book. The characters are not fleshed out very well, and Nora Buckley is a little too perfect, it's hard to believe she had no idea her marriage was in trouble. Also too much kinky sex which doesn't seem real. This book in no way comes up to the excellent standards I've come to expect from Beatrice Small."
2,Hoover Canister,"Good vacuum, but should be better for the price. Mine is falling apart after 1 year's use and hose won't stay inserted into canister without wrapping tape around it and forcing it in. Plastic lid covering tools broke off almost immediately, and foot buttons are poorly marked for on/off and hose retraction. I probably won't buy another Hoover Canister."
3,it was a blast,"I didn't know about this movie, but I happened to catch the movie showing on HBO, and I kind of liked it. I don't know about you, but two pretty guys and bunch of actions are all I expected out of this movie. Cuba and Skeet present themselves here as bunch of goofballs, which was successfully funny. This is not a serious film about a biochemical weapon, but it is simply an action-comedy. I must admit, without the boys, the plot of the movie is a bit too simple, but who needs a plot when there's Cuba and Skeet entertaining us with the perfect silly duet acting."
5,Chill Factor Warms This Reviewer,"Chill Factor is clearly a film you'll have warm feelings for. Cuba Gooding Jr., fresh from his Jerry McGuire role, is great. Richard Todd Aguayo's supporting role is especially notable as well -- his portrayal of Gomez shows Aguayo's versatility and dexterity with this slippery role. This is an action picture that you're sure to enjoy. I sure did!"
4,fun and action,If you look for a great entertainment watch this movie great fun and action. But don't expect something else .
2,A WASTE OF TALENT,"IT'S AMAZING HOW A GREAT ACTOR LIKE CUBA GOODING, JR. COULD WIN A BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR OSCAR FOR ''JERRY MAGUIRE'' AND THEN END UP IN A LOWBROW MOVIE LIKE THIS. A COOK [SKEET ULRICH] AND A THIEF [CUBA GOODING, JR.] MUST STOP A DEADLY CHEMICAL WEAPON FROM BEING USED BY A MADMAN [PETER FIRTH]. THE ACTION IS DECENT AND IT HAS A NICE SENSE OF HUMOR BUT THIS MOVIE JUST GETS TIRING AFTER A WHILE. I WOULDN'T REALLY RECCOMEND THIS TO ACTION FANS. BUT IF YOU LIKE THIS SORT OF ACTION FILM, GIVE IT A TRY."
1,Amazingly Bad.,"This is most likely one of the worst 10 movies I have had the dishonor to see in my lifetime. The plot is not enough to hold a five year olds attention for more than 2 min, and the acting, although the cast is talented, is horrible. There is absolutely no reason to buy or even rent this atrocity."
2,Formulaic and barely funny,"Having grown up with funny thrillers like Tango and Cash or Lethal Weapon, movies like Chill Factor just seem hollow. As stated above, this movie is an obvious ripoff of Speed. Not only is it a ripoff, but the jokes get in the way of the action. The first 20 minutes are attrocious, and in a 90 minute film that can be a bit of a problem. Predictable to the end, this movie just doesn't deserve some of the reviews I have seen for it."
2,don't waste your money,"This film had some decent action scenes, but it was nothing beyond that. The story is a [compilation] of several movies you've already seen, the characters are dry and pointless, and Cuba Gooding Jr never seems to nail down exactly what kind of character he's portraying. I can't watch him act... I never know where he's coming from, and I can't watch him act like virtually the same character in every one of his movies. Skeet plays his part with no heart as well... in fact the entire cast does. I guess it must be hard to do a movie knowing the script is as horrible as this one.Don't waste your money. There are better action films out there with heartfelt acting. This one isn't it."
4,I thaught it was great,"I read the other reviews.I guess I'm the only person that liked Chill Factor.OR the other reviewers just didn't know what the heck they were talking about.Personally i think it's the ""OR"" myself.Also they talk about how bad the acting is?Cuba was perfect.So was Skeet.Plot.Good.The bad dude(Brynner) becomes the skape goat for the U.S. military when a test of a bio weapon(Code named Elvis) go's wrong and kills 8 people.Brynner gets sent to prison for 10 years When he gets out he seeks revenge on the doc that was in charge of the opperation and the U.S. Government as well.One thing leads to another and Cuba and Skeet get a hold of Elvis and have to get it to an army base before the bad guys get it.I think that a little bit more could have been done with the plot myself.Like the bad guys frame Cuba and Skeet for taking Elvis and they have to prove otherwise.That would rock!But thats not the direction they went in.The directing was perfect.SFX was perfect. Casting.Perfect."
2,THE SILLY FACTOR,"Seeing Cuba as the comic relief character was a shock to myself! ANyway, this movie is a good action picture, no brains needed, the actor giving the exactly level of acting the script needs ( be it, almost none ). FUn to watch once and only once"
5,Vehicle Power Adapter,The VC700 EMU Vehicle Power Adapter for my Motorola Ear Bud is great! It works just as good as the original one I purchased from Motorola. I get three for the price of one so I can put one in each of our vehicles.
5,Very cool way to distribute software,"H&R Block 2006 works well like it always has. I've used and liked H&R since the Turbotax activation debacle, to the extent that I can like doing income tax! What is great is the media the software comes on. Install the program and then have a nice flash drive to use elsewhere. Maybe flash drives will be like floppies someday, with piles of used drives in a box, but for now it's a super handy way to store and move a few files. 256 megs makes for a big floppy but a small flash drive. No matter--the price it right."
2,Not at all thorough for small business and schedule c,"I always thought the laborious interviews in turbotax were pretty ridiculous, now I've seen the opposite. Taxcut online seems totally not thorough, such as just asking for total of certain things, and not asking if special circumstances apply, which you don't miss at all until you have one of them. I had almost completely finished my taxes and got to the business use of home. I moved half way through the year. I couldn't find where to add an additional home office listing. ""Nope, can't do it"" said support after an hour long chat session of mostly waiting, ""you'll have to use another product."" So today I start from scratch and pay the $99 ransom that turbotax is charging small business owners. I encourage the competition to get their shizzle together next year.s:o"
1,What about Windows ME and 98? HELP!!,"I just bought this yesterday, and though the product description here on Amazon says it's compatible with Windows 98 and Windows ME, the packaging says ""TaxCut USB Drive is compatible with Windows 2000 and Windows XP."" All our taxes for several years have been done on a Windows ME computer with a USB port. Now what? HELP!!"
1,Shortest game ever!,"It took all of 30min to beat, and completely loose interest in this game. It was not even worth the shipping fee! currently using it as a coaster."
2,Playing the game is like watching half a movie,"This is the first game I played that made me feel I was merely turning the pages of a pre-programmed novel. There is nothing you can do out of order, nothing to build up (skills or inventory), nothing you can skip (maybe a little bit), no side quests, no rewarding fights.What is worse, the story is too abstract, too complex. When the game ended, none of the loose ends were resolved.In short, playing this game is like watching half a movie."
2,alright...,"I think it is pretty good but not great. like someone else said theres not a ton of gameplay and so much talking. I luckily found out you can skip if you press B a lot, good story but can get tiring."
4,A Very Helpful Book,"""Secrets of Power Presentations"" offers practical, down-to-earth advice to help readers enhance their presentations. Written in a friendly tone, it can build confidence and skills. I recommend it to anyone who wants to dramatically improve their public speaking abilities."
5,Fabulous book!,"Tears of the Hawk sets a new standard for paranormal suspense. I was completely drawn into the story of Hawk and Charity. For the few short hours in which I read the book -- didn't put it down once--I truly believed in the world created by Ms. Clark. It takes a very talented author to draw a reader in that way. Be assured, Ms. Clark is a talented author of the highest order."
3,A Bit Over the Top,"While I thoroughly enjoy the Montana Mysteries, Kelly in all of his personas is a little over the top in both his politics and his attitudes. I think too much time is spent by Bowen on revisionist history and not enough time developing a likable character and reasonable plot lines to accompany him. All that aside, once one suspends belief and buys into an alternate universe theory of U.S. history, the book offers some rollicking good times and funny scenarios punctuated by action and gore.Kelly and the Three Toed Horse: A Novel Featuring Yellowstone Kelly, Gentleman and ScoutThe Tumbler (Montana Mysteries Featuring Gabriel Du Pre)"
2,An uneven mix of humor and violence,"The West of Bowen's Yellowstone Kelly is an odd mix of brutal violence and laugh out loud humor. This combination can occasionally work well; some authors have a knack for combining these two things into a fascinating work, but the balance is off here. There are outrageous events to be sure, battling paleontologists, a drunken blowhard of a Buffalo Bill, and of course that staple of western fiction, the Arabian prince and his harem. With this set up there are bound to be a few good laughs, but strewn throughout are also vicious killings that become discordant after awhile, not so much moving the plot along, rather they seem to be there to remind the reader that the West was a brutal place. It just doesn't mesh together well, and for me it was just too much of a bad thing spoiling a decent number of good laughs."
2,big hype,"After all the hype on Oprah and after reading reviews, I was disappointed. It gives a strange sensation and is very uncomfortable to use. It almost gave me a headache. Plus, there was absolutely nothing that came out as my water ran clear. Everyone marveled at how much gunk came out but that was not the case for me. Maybe I just need to wait until I feel congested to use it again."
2,just not remarkable!,"Great short term(about an hour) relief, but not for the long haul and certainly doesn't cure anything. Bottom line, your a ""pot sniffer"" the rest of your life if you have stuffed sinuses. Mike Scotto"
1,"Tinkle, Tinkle Little Pot","This product was delivered in many small pieces. The tinkle, tinkle sound indicated thin, light, cheap material. I have no use for the fragments."
5,Nice spout design,"The way the spout connects to the pot at a low point reduces the angle that you need to hold to pot at as you get towards the end. This also makes the water flow easier to control.Overall, very nice product."
5,Neti Pot really works,"I was leery of this when I first saw it on Oprah, but figured I'd tried almost everything else for my sinus trouble what could it hurt? When I first got it I had a hard time getting my head at the right angle so I didn't swallow the water which since its salty isn't tasty, but once you get the hang of it it works great for me no more prescriptions. I warm it up with some hot water before putting the salt solution in makes it more comfortable to use. I recommend this item."
5,Perfect Little Pot,This is a quality Neti Pot and worth the price. I recommend it to all my friends.Just the right size and easy to use.
4,Cheap and useful.,"I bought this neti pot about 3 years ago at Whole Foods. It's really helpful, but make sure to use distilled water. Chlorine in your nose BURNS. I've also not used it with salt, but may try that. Overall, this is a worthwhile piece of preventive medicine!"
3,Works Fine,"The neti pot itself is fine, if you like neti pots. This was my first experience with them, and I didn't have much benefit from it."
4,It's great,"Fits my nose perfectly and clears out the sinuses. I haven't used other neti pots, so I don't know if this is normal, but on this one if you fill it up (within 1.5 inches of the top), it tends to spill when you're carrying it. Not a huge deal, but slightly annoying."
4,A life saver...,"Thank you Oprah. I really don't like the show nor do I generally watch it, but the one day I happened to turn it on also happened to be the day that they were introducing the neti pot to her screaming fans as well as a time when I was suffering from my first sinus infection, a.k.a., the worst experience of my life. I went out and bought one right away and wouldn't you know that rinsing my sinuses had relieved enough pressure that I was able to function that evening (a serious issue before rinsing)?? I love this thing. Use it all the time and would recommend, and have been recommending, it to anyone. This particular pot only gets 4 stars b/c the tip is actually a little large for my nostrils, and one of them (my fiancee has one too) has already cracked. But hey, it might fit you fine and I just might not be careful enough w/ my ceramics. This is also the only pot I've used so I don't have a fair comparison of the other pots. Happy shopping, and seriously, try one of these things out!"
3,I guess I am a rarity,As soon as the fluid gets up to my sinus cavity I instantly feel a strong pressure in my forehead before it comes out my other nostril. Even weirder is that it goes in and out when I start with my right nostril but it will not reciprocate when using my left nostril. I am also left with mild headaches ?!?
4,Much better than plastic pots,"This is the second netipot I have owned. The first was supposed to be an antimicrobial plastic, but I noticed recurring mold in it. I chose this one because my partner has had the same one for years now without any of the funk problems. I also like the half-circle opening at the top. Now if I overfill it, it doesn't come running down the side of my face from the top. My only complaint is I wish the spout opening was a bit wider, but this jut means I need to take a bit longer."
5,Excellent cleansing - no problems,"I purchased this nasal cleansing pot after suffering from a sinus infection. My doctor actually recommended I get one and use it at least once a week to avoid future sinus infections. I had heard all these horror stories about ""feeling as if you're drowning"" and ""what a mess it makes,"" but I didn't have a single issue my first time (or since for that matter). As long as you read the directions, and tilt your head as they recommend, you will not create a mess. And I've never felt the drowning sensation, but I also pour my water slowly through the nasal passages. I highly recommend this to anyone suffering from sinus issues. I'm able to avoid many of my sinus headaches now by using this as often as I feel necessary (which is normally once or twice a week.)"
4,Breathing easy!,This product is great. It works wonders on clearing my sinuses. I have bought this for other family members and recommended it to friends. It does not include any saline packets but you can make your own solution with one cup lukewarm water and 1/4tsp salt.
5,The nose knows!,"My daughter, the yoga master, has recommended one of these for years. I finally broke down and got one. It is great and easy to use. I have allergies and this really clears the head. Now my husband has ordered one for his daughter."
3,feels like an ocean wave going up your nose,Allergies: this product will clear you up for five minutes then the instant refill. The effects don't last long. Make sure you don't put too much salt in with the water. It hurts. I use this as a last resort because it really isn't pleasant unless you like that ocean up your nose effect.
2,Neti Pot not all That,"I bought this because I have suffered from sinus problems for over 20 yrs and Dr. Oz from Oprah recommended it.It was a slight help, but absolutely not to the point of any substantial relief as the testimonials were on the show."
2,NETI pot,"This Neti Pot seems to work properly. I have never seen it mentioned that nasal irrigation may not work for all people, though. It causes me intense sinus pain, and my doctor validated this, saying that she has heard of that. Just thought it might be something to consider."
2,Not for everyone,"I used this product to hopefully help with my severe allergies and not being able to breathe through my nose at night. I used the neti pot as directed, and it seemed to work great. I was able to breathe through both nostrils, so I was very hopeful. I went to sleep and woke up about 4 hours later with SEVERE congestion. I was not able to pass anything through my nostrils at this point.It was worth a shot, but I don't think this is a ""cure-all"" for everyone :("
4,Breathe Through Your MOUTH,"This is a pretty good product, but remember to take your time, slow down, and breathe through your mouth!! If you don't follow these directions, you will most likely get water in (like when you are in the pool--it hurts) or maybe into your ear canal.It seems to be a good product and I recommend it for anyone to try who has allergies or just plain wants to clean their nose (from a dirty job maybe?)."
3,good but could be better,"I've used this one for awhile with good results. However, I may replace it because I noticed that crevices on the inside of the pot tend to grow mold or mildew. For example, there are indents on the inside of the pot where the handle is attached. This appears to be due to the ceramic manufacturing process. Also, mold tends to appear on the inside of the spout. It is a good idea to sterilize it frequently. Otherwise, it works well."
4,.,"Broke the 1st time I received it but when reported, promptly was sent another at no charge :) good customer service"
5,Use it everyday.,"As a chronic sinus allergy sufferer, I must do a saline rinse every day. I bough this to replace the blue plastic one I was using and couldn't be happier with it."
5,Worth every penny.,"This netti pot works great! I suffer from year round allergies since a kid and have tried everything from allergy shots to prescription rhinocourt sprays to claritin (which seems to work well enough but just too darn expensive to do daily) to ablation at the Ear, Nose and Throat specialists to reduce the inflamed tissue blocking my nasal passages. The netti pot is probably the most effective and cheapest method I've found so far to open blocked nasal passages. It is most effective if you do it 2x daily once in the morning and once again before bed."
4,Neti pot,"The product provides the relief as advertised, but the advertisement on the Amazon web site was for an unbreakable item. The item received is made of ceramic (breakable). I contacted the vendor and he said that the unbreakable ones were on backorder, and they would send an unbreakable one when they come in. Just yesterday I called and the message was the same, still on backorder will not be in for two more weeks, I am beginning to wonder if their really is an unbreakable unit??. The vendor is still selling the ""unbreakable "" units on Amazon, Why??"
5,Strong tools,This item has very strong tools and not likely to snap off in your tire. The plugs are the brown sticky ones which I always found to be superior to the black rubber ones and cement.
5,Everyone needs one,"This is one of the best plug kits available. Everyone needs one of these under the seat. It can save you money, headaches, and time. Also a great gift idea..."
3,Intimate French baroque Music,"Good academic study, a little too long and not enough of a bird view of the baroque musics in Europe and their interrelationship."
5,Mind Over Matter,"It's often said the most important bit of space out on the ice is the five inches between your ears. For the most part, you can't argue against it.The technical, tactical, physical stuff has to be taken care of, we all know that. But it's often the mind that's the organizer and driver of these things.This clearly written and entertaining book is awash with insights, sound advice, anecdotes and rational strategies to get your mind (and ultimately actions) working for you.An absolute gem of applied psychology.Highly recommended."
4,Great Read,"This is a great read. I recomend it for both players and Coaches.It has improved my game both on and off the ice. Using some of the techniques Saul writes about definitely works and willopen up your senses. He will make you realize what you have been missing out on, and or teach you ways to make better whatyou allready know about the mental aspect of the game. This book works with any sport, not just hockey.Great book to have."
3,Hockey Tough,"good book, but save yourself the cost of expedited shipping. I chose this option from a used book seller, but it still took a long time for the book to arrive."
1,BAD!,Nothing good to say. This product was misrepresnted. Nothing to do with motorcycle touring. It contained less than ten minutes of any thing containing motorcycles. Nothing more than a travel sales video containingcommercials.
5,Extremely Satisfied,"I am very pleased with this DVD i looked for it for a long time, this is one of the best black movies of all time i knew Amazon would have it they never let me down . they always have what i want and the best prices of all the different vendors i search on . they will forever have my business,Bigg Badd Danny Quinn."
5,"Must see for today's teens who are meth, crack or script addicts!!","This is a powerful and very real movie about the affect of drugs on teens, the family and the community. My husband talked about it several times over the years, because he saw it at a young age. I can definitely see why it made such an impression on him. Excellent movie!!!"
4,works great,"I do some occasional recording and my old onboard sound card started to fritz, so I replaced it with this one. Installation was straightforward, and it works great. I am running WinXP and the drivers had no problem installing from CD. I opted not to install the bundled software- the interface is dated and hideously ugly. Nice simple sound card."
5,Easy fast install,"I received the product a little later than I expected but otherwise I was very satisfied. It took me longer to remove the housing and modem that was in the only PCI slot on this computer than to install the sound card and install the drivers. Sound worked as soon as I booted the computer. For what this computer is used for, it was an excellent choice. No bells and whistles, but just a great lower priced product. This card was installed to replace the on-board sound which failed and installed in my 94 year old mother's computer which is mainly used for games. She is happy and that's all that matters."
3,Not Terrible,"I got this sound card during a 2-week fight with my onboard sound and an old Soundblaster Audigy card. The Audigy did not want to play nicely on an XP/AMD64 machine. While trying to get that to work, my onboard sound completely died.I have a decent home recording studio, and although getting this card installed was easy and painless-- despite outdated documentation-- this is by no means meant for recording. Its capturing quality is bad enough that I suspect that even someone not going for professional recording quality might even be disappointed. Yes, even voice only.Luckily I can route around it with my Zoom H4's USB interface. Sound playback on this card is on par with other cards, so overall this card is useful and serves a purpose. Also, the game/MIDI port works well, and its latency is on par with the Soundblaster's latency, so no complaints there.I am definitely planning on eventually replacing it with something better. Decent, but not great, value."
1,Masive money waste...,"This audio card is good if you are only going to connect to two channels, and don't even expect actual 3D sound, no the left front and back will play the same thing also the right front and back. So if you are actually looking for a just stereo sound card this is what you are looking for. I almost forgot to tell you, it is a pain in the back to get the drivers, and when you get the drivers in startech.com you can install it but then wait until your screen turns blue... yes the blue screen we all fear... My advice is don't buy it! i will have to buy another one. i would give it -2 stars but that's not possible :("
1,A lot of grief,"I have 2 PCs which run XP. On PC#1, I installed the card without any apparent problems. I then tried to install it in PC#2 and ran into issues with the install and had to try several times. Each time it went into an endless loop during bootup (unlike the install on PC#1, I was asked to reboot to finish the install process). Finally, it seemed to install (it didn't ask for a reboot) and ran all day. My relief was short-lived however. When I rebooted the next day,the PC went into an endless loop. So,I thought, at least I can use it in PC#1. Wrong! After several minutes the PC froze. The card is now installed in my junk pile."
1,Love Hina's usual light tone dragged down to darkness,"This book lacks all the aspects that make the LH series so desirable. There is almost no character progression in the story or development at all in this. The entire promise story, Tokyo U and all other character plots make an abrupt stop as Kanako (you'll learn who she is) enters the story. This book is actually frustrating to read because you hate the newest addition to the cast so much. It's a worthless struggle and the best part is when she is completely overthrown temporarily. I seriously hope that Kanako doesn't stay in the story for long at all because it would be an absolute disaster that would pretty much ruin the story. There's only a few more books left in the series, let's just hope that those manage to climb up from the crater that this one blew them down into.(Oh yeah, and a talking cat? PLEASE NO MORE!)"
1,New character ruins this book,"All the other books were great to read through, but this one I was just waiting for the girl to just go away. A freind of mine who had also finished the book said he just skipped to the end because Kanako was just such a drag. If you were smart you would skip this one and go on with book 12. You aint missing much with this one."
2,first bad love hina book in the series,"While the superb artwork is up to par with the rest of the series, this may seriously be the start of the ""downhill"" slope for the storyline. The lack of the main character for most of the book (and thus no interaction with Naru), plus the introduction of a irritating new character, make this the first bad Love Hina book. I hope the next books can spring back with some of the older Love Hina storyline, because this new character may be enough to ruin the series."
5,Best Yet!,This is my favorite Love Hina so far. Keitaro finally left for America and he'll be gone for 6 months! The Hinata House residents are already falling apart. then something unexpected happens. Keitaro's little sister who's hobby happens to be impersonating others shows up on scene. She is nothing like Keitaro. She tears down Hinata House and turns it into Hinata Inn! If the residents want to stay there they must work for her and she is ruthless! She causes a revolt among the members but what will happen when they all aren't on the same side? Not to mention she is obsessed with her brother and wants to marry him! She will stop at nothing to accomplish this goal even if it means destroying Naru! You have absolutely got to read this volume!
5,New Dimension of Love Hina,"I know there are many people who don't want the plot to progress outside of Naru and Keitaro, but I thought that the new character added a new dimension to the series. I say, anyone who doesn't like it should stop their moaning and stop degrading the series with their whining and complaining."
4,It works fine,"Not excited about it, however it did fulfill the task of binding. Its a good idea to also invest in a high capacity stapler so you staple before you slap on the hot glue."
3,Interesting but should have been better.,This book is interesting but seems to have been rushed into print. Parts of the text seemed like a draft and one of the photos was printed reversed (Parson Weem's Fable.) The paper is very cheap with resulting muddy pictures. Hoving seems to have negative comments about most critics and art historians that he mentions while congratulating himself on his perception. I expected better; his King Tut book was fantastic.I would recommend American Gothic by Stephen Biel as the first choice but at least this one is cheaper.
2,Disappointing,"I am in complete agreement with the one other customer review that has appeared to date for this book. The information offered is interesting. However, this book was cheaply produced and apparently rushed into print to coincide with the 75th anniversary of the creation of Grant Wood's masterpiece. The illustrations hardly merit the name, so murky they completely obscure the author's points. And there doesn't seem to have been even the most cursory edit. The frequent typos, grammatical errors, jumbled words are a major distraction. Quite honestly, someone of Thomas Hoving's stature should be embarassed to have his name attached to this."
4,Good and Plenty,"While it could be considered a flawed book that was cheaply produced, Hoving's ideas and insights are more than bright enough to overcome any mistakes. Walking us through his method of appraising a work of art, the reader learns what to look for and how to draw their own conclusions and interpretations.I learned an art historian's approach varies to that of the critic and the public is better for abiding both points of view. Hoving believes American Gothic is a masterpiece and he make an explicit case and raises Wood up as an original artist, perhaps an under appreciated talent.I would recommend this book and contrast it with Steven Biel's excellent book on American Gothic. Both authors appreciate American Gothic without pretense."
2,know what to expect,"Lightscribe is a good idea but without color printing on the dvd it looks to ""x-rayish."" would rather use printable dvd's than go through the expense of the lightscribe. Would recommend for music or story titles without photo."
3,Too Much Information,"Looking for a book which contains images of some of today's best katsina dolls? They're here. How about a book on T-shirts, cheap posters and napkin holders? Toss in plastic cups, billboards and tin buttons and you begin to see the intent of this book. Editor Pearlstone has gathered the best and the worst images of katsinam over the years. Wherever and whenever a katsina image has been used, examples are included. Fine carvings and jewelry are represented. A number of Hopi and non-Hopi artists are profiled. To me, the inclusion of so much dime store junk detracted from what is otherwise an extremely well researched volume. This, however, is the editor's intent ... to commodify EVERY example of the katsina in past and present society. One of her objectives was to illustrate how non-Native society has continued to use the katsina image in so many (inappropriate) ways. A book for every collectors' library? I wouldn't recommend this one."
5,Very happy with my choice...,"My choice came down to Minolta HTSi Plus or Canon EOS Rebel X or 2000. Features are VERY similar. I preferred the HTSi Plus' feel and viewer displays, so I choice Minolta's body. (FYI, I worked with the 28-80 lens for 3 weeks, then decided to upgrade to a 28-200mm for more flexibility.) The features allow tons of growth/learning by the photographer, while still taking great shots right out of the box. It's designed so that the photographer can take as much control over the shot as they want, with the onboard computer handling whatever the photographer doesn't feel comfortable with: From focus to aperture and fstop settings. Variety of optional presets allow immediate creativity while the photographer learns more about lighting, angles, film, and composition with each shot. No, I don't work for Minolta. I just love their camera."
1,awful product,The shaft broke after 3 feet of use. This was my first Freud bit. I'll never buy this brand again. I recommend you do not buy Freud.
4,Sweet,We recently built a house in VA with a screened in Porch. The evenings can be cool and the table heater was perfect to make our evenings comfortable again. We don't stay out that long that fuel size an issue. Looking at taking the heater to our next tailgate. Will provide an update. May have to do a video of that one. Great product. Easy to assemble.
4,Table top Patio Heater,I love my heater! I do however wish that the assembly instructions were more specific. It took too long to figure it out with just a diagram.
1,Stopped working after 3 months,"It worked great the 12 times i used it. Now it will light the pilot light and as long as I hold in button the pilot stays lit. However as soon as I let go the pilot goes out, even if I hold for 45 seconds.How do I get it repaired?"
2,Poor Packaging allows for damage during shipment,I purchased this item and it arrived damaged due to very little protection on the sides of the box. The aluminum top was the part that was damaged.
4,Nice little outdoor heater,"This is a nice little heater. I live in So Cal, and it never really gets too cold here. I got it for my patio, to put on a table for outdoor events. It was easy to set up, even I could do it. The package arrived un-mangled, and all parts were present. Ii read the directions, and though they were a little confusing because the pics were black and white, i figured it out in about 30 min total time from opening the box to starting the heater. I did have a little trouble starting the heater. When starting the heater, the knob is supposed to be turned to the pilot option, AND pushed in while the ignition button starts the fire. This gave me about 10 min of trouble as I've never turned one of these things on before. Now I am a pro and will be using this heater during the holidays. It does not take up too much space, and can be in the middle of a conversation without disrupting the conversation."
1,Please contact me,I just recently tried to use this and it does not work. Please contact me on how I can return and get a replacement.
3,Table top heater - luke warm,"This works as a table top heater..... it'll keep you luke warm.If you have any wind what so ever, it turns into a metal center piece and you'll be cold.The heater does take those long Coleman 1.2lb tanks for little tailgate BBQ's, so that good.But other than huddling close to it, you won't get that much out of it. I suggest you spend an extra $50 and get a full size."
4,"Fire Sense Propane Table Top Patio Heater, Copper Finish",Unit functions as advertised. Construction quality is moderate - with propane tank access door fitting a good example of less than precision fit.
3,Good heater with a few adjustments,This works well as described and will provide a warming radius of about 10 feet around a table. While the unit does take the small 1.02 lb propane tanks you really need to purchase an extension hose so you can attach it to a regular 20 lb tank. The small tanks only last about 45 minutes before they start to freeze up and make it necessary to plug another one in. We use this in South Carolina in a 3 sided enclosed porch and it keeps us warm during our evening outdoor dinners.
1,"Worthless product, and worse support","Product is not packaged well, you can count on the heat shield being dented upon arrival.Workmanship on product slightly less than one would expect from an 8th grade shop class. (my apologee to 8th grade shop class students/teachers)Although parts don't match exactly with instructions; with a little work you can put this together.Mine doesn't work. No gas through regulator. But hey, this kind of thing happens right? Just a quick trip to the manufacturers website for information on a spare part or service. Good luck. A click on the ""Live Chat"" returns an ""Offline"" response. Try and send a message on the ""Contact Us"" page and you'll get a response ""Too Long"" No phone number is provided.A note to 'Fire Sense' (the manufacturer) If your business plan is to provide no customer service, skip the ""Contact Us"" page on your website.Awful product, awful company. Stay away or you'll get burned. (get it, it's a heater)"
1,Unit did not work,"Maybe we got a defective unit, but the gas would not flow through the unit. I tried all sorts of ways to get the dial to let the gas through, but nothing worked. I even tried 3 other gas bottles. I bought a different brand, used the same gas bottles and it worked just fine."
2,Dented upon arrival,"The Propane Table Top Patio Heater (stainless steel) arrived promptly. However, the top part, which reflects the heat, had two dents. Since it seemed well packed, I can only imagine that it got damaged at the factory, but this is just a guess. This was a gift, and the recipients didn't want to return it (because it was a hassle to disassemble and put all the parts back in the box). The heater works fine; it gives about a 3'-4' radius worth of heat. FYI: It doesn't come with the 1.02 lb. propane tank."
2,Typical chinese construction,"Be forewarned, this product is made in China. As such, the workmanship is minimal and the materials substandard. No edge is finished. Just the action of changing the tank is guaranteed to provide your hand with one or more cuts from the sharp edges of the opening. Every piece is of the poorest quality of metal. The hardware is of the cheapest quality. Even if it works as advertised, I'm very unhappy with the typical chinese workmanship. Even the foam it was packed in is unrecycleable. Just more landfill."
2,Not So Hot,"I've been to strip clubs a lot, and this video just doesn't do much for me. The girls on here are very pretty, yet most of them don't display a lot of creativity in their acts. They can dance well enough, but with few exceptions their overall acts are relatively bland and unerotic. I was especially surprised that most of the girls strip immediately without any buildup of suspense. It's as though the contest was very rushed, so you're left feeling like you've seen just short clips of strip-tease acts. Now, a video of good-looking women dancing nude can't be all bad, but it can be done a lot better than this. Also, I'm not sure why this sometimes is said to be a 2-DVD set, but mine had only one in it. My favorite strip-tease videos are Premium Cuts: Sinsational Strippers, Sinsational Strippers 2,Hot Sexy Strippers: Trilogy, andPlayboy TV - America's Hottest Strip Clubs, which are done with a lot more finesse and variety."
3,Stripping,"This is a decent product. The women are beautiful and it makes for an enjoyable veiwing experience. However, it's just not the same as being there live."
3,Used/like new Sony cd player.,I paid more for Like New but it was filthy and smelly. It plays but not all the buttons are fully operable.
3,"Elmo makes kids happy, but this isn't the best effort from the Sesame Street gang.","It's a sweet toy, and the premise is a good one... an animatronic Elmo that ""jumps"" and shouts. The song is a cute rendition of the familiar tune and Elmo is Elmo (so kids will love him).The toy itself, while being pretty cool at first, quickly makes you wonder what the engineers were thinking. It's fairly unstable (top heavy), enough so that the ""Help Elmo, he fell down"" is triggered on nearly every play.It's a one-trick pony too. And although the outer coat is soft, the interior isn't, so your child won't be squeezing it. My kid likes it, but doesn't really play with this one much. It's sort of sad, he was given it as a very thoughtful (and pricey) gift; so it's hard to be objective about the toy vs. the gesture."
1,Didn't work after 3 days,It's a nice toy. But it stopped working after 3 days by the time my son enjoyed playing. I already saw same feedback from another customer. May be it's of old stock... It's not worth buying for me...
2,"you shout ,as it doesnt","i bought this recently .It worked well for a week and it stopped working.Its bit heavier ,it lost its actions.I dont suggest /buy unless this problems are fixed.kris"
1,Disappointed,"We have several other Elmo's, which my daughter loves, but we are very unhappy with this one. I estimate that three out of four times that my daughter tries to play the music Elmo falls over. I can only assume that this is a design error."
3,Scary to my two year old,"My son got it as a gift for his 2 yr birthday. He liked it when we unwrapped it. But has been maintaining a distance ever since he saw it swinging his arms around. He watches it from a distance if we turn him on. Sometimes he grabs my finger and uses it to turn it on and then quickily moves behind. Elmo is now gracing a table which is placed in my son's special corner and gets an occasional request for dance when I am around to ""protect"" my brave little boy from the monster."
2,Not worth the $$$,"I was suprised to see that they increased the price of this toy from 29.99 to 34.99. There's hardly any educational value for this toy.As another reviewer had pointed out this toy keeps falling down whenever it swings it's arm. The toy I have gets stuck and I have to release it's arms. I thought my son would love this toy when I bought it for him. He just turns the other way when he sees it.If you see this toy in Aisle in any store, just let your kids play with it in the store and come back. It's most likely that they are not going to spend anymore time with the toy at home!."
2,Good One.. BUT.......,"The Elmo is good but does not have enough balance to stay on a carpeted floor. When the Elmo starts shouting and moving, it trips and falls on a carpeted floor. So Sad that I have to hold it and make it dance."
2,There are better Elmo toys out there...,"My daughter received this as a first birthday present and was very eager to get Elmo out of the box after the party. We put him on the ground and hit the button and she watched him for about 30 seconds. That was 5 months ago and our enjoyment time with this toy has been, to date, about 5 minutes total.The problems are:1) Elmo is top-heavy and falls over at every play whether on tile, wood or carpet.2) There is a button on the top of each of his feet to activate him, but they are not marked. My daughter never can seem to activate them by herself (this is a child who can already open all the doors in our house at 17 months and control the TV volume with the remote). Even I have had to feel around to get Elmo moving.3) The only movements Elmo does is bend a little and then swing his arms around (which makes him fall over). Underwhelming to say the least.I'd definitely encourage others to invest in another Elmo toy!"
1,Scary Elmo!,"They are obviously running out of new ideas for Elmo. This Elmo is obnoxious and quite frankly a little scary. We played with him in the store and he fell out of the shelf on top of my daughter while vigorously waving his arms. She is a big fan of Elmo, but DID NOT like this one. We could not even get him to stop- he was already not working properly. Get Check-Up Elmo- he is much better!"
1,Seller sucks,The toy didn't work and it smelled of cigarette smoke. My son had loved this toy at daycare so wanted to buy.
3,fun but annoying,"This was a riot at first, but as you know little kids love to do the same thing over and over and over and over... well let's put it this way... elmo found a way of getting lost over time because my sister wanted to kill me. My niece love it... but it's a gift you give to somebody else's kid.:)"
2,Used or very shop worn.,"The book was supposed to be new. It had food on the dust cover, and finger prints on the book cover. My daughter looked at it and said it was in too bad of shape to give to my grandson, Daniel, for his baptism."
1,WARNING: PLEASE DO NOT READ THIS BOOK,"Please do not read this book as it contains utter nonsense because a lot of the quotes are translated wrongly. It makes the holy Granth sound like a book of fairy tales. The author does not even read the original Granth in Gurmukhi! Rather, he read only one translation in English. How is he to get the true meaning of the holy Granth? The translations in English are word for word and don't pay attention to the cultural and historical background at the time of the writing and this causes a lot of the translations to seem awkward. THIS IS A GRAVE INSULT TO THE SIKH FAITH and should not be read by anyone who wants to learn about the Sikhs."
4,Enriched,"It is quite interesting to read and to explore what the Sri Guru Granth Sahib says about itself and the concept of God, sin and salvation.This is the first book I've read which explains clearly what Sikhs believe in. It has been fascinating and enlightening to gain positive knowldge on sikhism. Some of my associates are sikhs and it has enriched my understanding of their faith and beliefs. It has also helped to build bridges.The book is written in easy English to understand, as Gurumukhi the orginal text is very difficult to understand. It is easily accessible to students, young and old and draws in reader of all backgrounds whatever, race or creed.In my ministry this book has been a very useful tool, when coming in contact with people from sikh background. It also has been helpful to build bridges over ignorance and lack of knowldge.I would highly recommend this book to any reader who seeks to learn the fundementals of the Sikh faith.Pastor Simon Bhardwaj"
3,Mind Over Matter,"Pretty predictable. Except for the professions of the characters, the general plot was the same as so many others of hers. I was disappointed."
4,Enjoyable,"Very nice story, I think I've read it before and just forgot before buying. Still very enjoyable. Good any age group."
3,Slow but good,Where this book at time can move on the slower side it is still a good read for Nora Roberts fans.
3,This was not one of my favorites!!!!,"I like Nora Roberts ALOT.....she's one of my favorites...but this book didn't even make the cut for a good book. I'd say it was a decent read...but not up to snuff with her other more recent books. I guess when they say you get better with age is true!!!! Aurora is not a normal 28 yr. old women. She dabbles in the paranormal behavior....as does her mother, Clarissa.....and fights tooth and nail to keep herself away from David Brady. Needless to say....this was not a great read."
4,Where's Peter Jennings?,"I bought In Search for Jesus bacause it was advertised that it is hosted by Peter Jennings and also bought Jesus, Mary and Da Vinci for the same reason. Elizabeth Vargas actually hosted it. Though she delivered it very well, it is so disappointing for the fans of Peter Jennings to find out later that it was not him. Anyways, I will add another star for the longer appearance of Dan Brown here compared to The Da Vinci Code Decoded where he only appeared in less than a minute, but was advertised as his DVD. Can I get my money back or some kind of discount for this error?"
4,As Good as the Movie!,"For those who saw the movie, you know the songs that are in this CD. The only draw back is ""Kids in America"" by Len. Kim Wilde's version is WAY better, even though it came out way back in 1982. All Digimon fans should buy this CD"
3,One Hit Wonder,"I'll keep this brief. Most of the songs on this album are junk. I know people will disagree with me, but honestly, they are.The only real saving grace is LEN's rendition of Kids in America. This is an *EXCELLENT* cover, and is in my opinion just hands down better than the original.If you buy this album, you're buying it for this song, and you will get your money's worth."
4,What a great soundtrack!,I bought this CD because I heard some good songs in the movie. It's worth the cash. Trust me. Get it. Soon. You'll be happy you did!
3,This is not the original soundtrack,"OK, I haven't heard all of the songs on this CD, so I gave a kind of neutral rating, but I know most of them even though I've only seen a bit of Digimon. This is because most of the songs have NOTHING to do with Digimon, and if you compare them with the original Japanese soundtrack, this might as well be the soundtrack for a different show. It's the same with the American Pokemon soundtrack which I actually own - this is all just popular music compiled together to make the show look cool. (The original Japanese music fits the show way better, and is really great and creative.) So if you just want cool music, get it, but if you want Digimon music you'll want to import the REAL Japanese OST."
3,Decent CD...,"This CD is OK. If you're a Digimon fan, you'll probably want to get it. However, I've just got to ask... what is with all the non-Digimon songs? It's like what they did with Pokémon--just added random pop music to make more money. All Star was a great inclusion, but otherwise... Well, let's just say I HATED Kids In America."
2,Good for little crazy obsessed kids,"Less Than Jake and The Mighty Mighty Bosstones, two of the greatest ska bands I've ever heard, (they're the only reason this album gets any stars is b/c of them- 1 for each) on some stupid mainstream TV show for 8 year old's soundtrack? At first I didn't believe, at second I didn't respect it, but now, although I'm not happy with it, I guess it's okay. It's good exposure. Who knows, maybe it will induce some kind of ska-crazed militia of Digimon fans- ya know, kind of a 4th-wave. That would be good. Otherwise, kids will just listen to the other stupid songs on the album, be tricked into radio's evil scheme, and listen to talentless bands who don't write their own songs or play instruments (i.e. Britney Spears, nsink, backside boys, etc etc). Wow music in America blows right now."
2,"A pretty good CD, but needs some work.","I honestly think that they should have added Radiohead, Master P, Busta Rhymes, The Smashing Pumpkins, Metallica, The Offspring, and DMX instead of Paul Gordon, Smash Mouth(that's already old enough), Fatboy Slim, and Barenaked Ladies(I don't think so!)Digirap should have been sung by Limp Bizkit.Kids in America should be replaced with Creed's ""Inside Us All""The Impression That I get should be sung by The Smashing Pumpkins.All My Best Friends Are Metalheads needs more rock like ""Godsmack""Run Around should be replaced with The Deftone's Change(in the house of flies).Here We Go should be changed to Master P instead of Jason Gochin.So, I do agree with Eric Kim. Good, but nothing great.Rating: 6/10"
3,"Better Songs, Please!","They Should of added in:Falling Away From Me=KornNowhere to Run=DMX, Ozzy Ozzbourne, and ODBMy Generation=Limp BizkitYour Disease=Saliva...So Don't waste your money on this."
4,Not bad for Digimon,"I'm definately NOT a Digimon Fan, but when my little brother was checkin out some Cds I decided to look just for the heck of it.My brother was holding 2 Cds Digimon and some other one.I looked at them and noticed that the songs in Digimon were really cool!My brother chose the other one and I decided to choose Digimon (because of the songs) I was impressed by some of the songs they had.It had some of my fav. groups in it like, Smash Mouth(all star),Fat Boy Slim(The Rockefeller Skank) , and BNL(one week)I have these group's CDs but mine are a different album, Smash Mouth, I have Fush yu Mang,All Star is in Astro Lounge,Bare Naked Ladies, I have maroon, One week is on Stunt,Fatboy Slim,I have Halfway between the gutter and the stars, while The Rockefeller Skank is on You've come a long way.The only regrets I have for buying this is because of all the Digimon songs!"
4,Not as Good as expected,"Some of the songs were good. The one I detested was ""Kids in America"" by Len (The version by Kim Wilde is WAY better). I'm an avid Digimon fan, this was disapointing for me. It's good to have if you like Digimon."
2,Here's how I would put it.,"1. Digimon Main Theme2. Filter and the Crystal Method: (Can't You) Trip Like I Do3. Limp Bizkit: Rollin' (Air Raid Vehicle)4. Prodigy and Tom Morello: One Man Army5. Drowning Pool: Bodies6. Linkin Park: Papercut7. Incubus and DJ Greyboy: Familiar8. Korn: Make Me Bad9. Moby: Bodyrock10. Gorillaz: Digi Rap11. Green Day: Spill12. Barenaked Ladies: Hey Digimon13. Blink 182: Nowhere Near14. Alien Ant Farm: Run Around15. The Offspring: Here We Go16. Mansun and 808 State: Skin Up Pin UpAnyway, this CD could have been better with more rock and techno."
2,More Pencils NEEDED,"The picture shows a fairly detailed amount of shading with the colors. HOWEVER, the shading is achieved by BLENDING -- with PENCILS. There were only 10 (yes ten) colored pencils total and a grey and black short pencil in the one I bought. this is more of a dollar tree item than the 4.79. I was disappointed."
2,hard to use,"The one thing about this kit that I find impossible to use is the way it is numbered. Instead of placing the numbers in pale ink on the picture, it had a second copy with the numbers to use as a guide. The pencils are not numbered but the back of the box has color matches. That means you have to keep the entire box handy just for the color guide.Plus, the roughness of the picture paper defies precise use of the pencils. Too complicated, not fun to use."
4,Really like this kit,"I ordered this kit & have done a couple of them now. One of the things that I don't like is mixing the colors. That just might be a personal thing though. I like coloring the picture to where it is vibrant & when you mix the two colors, it doesn't turn out very well. You would be better off using a different color all together. I guess that might be where individuality comes in or creativity comes in. But, all in all....it is still a very good product & I would recommend it to anyone to purchase."
1,newman never changes,"This is horrible Bach (or any) playing. Insanely fast, profoundly ugly, unmusical, ultimately unexciting. Those who like it are not, I suggest, really listening to what Newman is doing, what the sense is, the shape, the organization, the structure, the phrasing, the hand ensemble.Imagine trying to put a metronome to it. It is not ""free"" or ""liberated"" or anything else but smeary and way way too fast. Rhythmically irregular, jerky, lurched, inept.Virgil Fox was better than this. Newman was quite as he is here 30+ years ago; amazing he has had a career and contracts and academic appointments.Listen to the clips on this site and see if you can follow it, or if it builds any cumulative power for you. Then find and listen to Anton Heiller play the same pieces (esp S.548 in e), or even Walcha, Rogg, Rubsam, Koopman, or Hurford."
4,"warm. not perfect, linty but keeps me comfortable.","I got this sheepskin cover to keep my back warm when I get in the car, my jacket goes up & my back touches the cold leather seat. The middle of the back and the seat cover are real sheepskin, the sides and edges are synthetic. Good value though, I paid $18 I think. The real sheepskin is supersoft! The fake stuff, not as luxurious but it's OK. The fake stuff was linty on my dark jacket, but I was too lazy to vacuum it- that would probably take care of the problem. It didn't fit totally smooth, and was a pain to hook the straps on but once done I'm satisfied. Worth the money. I do have to cut out a hole for my side airbag on my seat though. So either get one that's OK for side airbags if you have one or plan on cutting a hole so it doesn't impede the airbag from working correctly."
2,Disappointing.,"I guess there are just some things you shouldn't buy on line. These looked good in the picture, and were well regarded in the reviews, but now that they are here...sigh. They dont fit my seats very well (2001 Kia Sportage). The 'genuine sheepskin' is foot-wide strip that runs from two inches back from the lip of the seat to about the small of my back. The rest is plush, muppet-like fake fur. The first passenger who saw them laughed and said they reminded her of Big Bird mating with Snuffleupagus--instead of a subdued beige, they are a bright and lurid blonde-yellow, and the sheepskin part is almost orange."
4,Great except for color,"Everything was exactly as described. They fit nicely and were easy to put on. My deduction of a star was because the color pictured is more like ecru and the actual color is much more yellow than that. Bright and rather loud. The lambskin portion is a little lighter than the synthetic fur.I would recommend them, but would never buy the champagne again."
1,awful,I made the mistake to purchase this by looking the pictures. But in real is just a little strip of sheepskin in the middle and the rest is awful. Don't buy it!
1,not as shown,I ORDERD THESE COVERS FROM AMAZON ABOUT A MONTH AGO.THERE IS VERY LITTLE IF ANY SHEEPSKIN ON THESE COVERS.POORLY MADE.I WOULD HAVE PAID MORE FOR A BETTER SEAT COVER.PLEASE BEWARE BEFORE YOU ORDER THIS ITEM.IM NOT HAPPY.
2,SHEEP SKIN SEAT COVER,"In paying 8o+ dollars I assumed they would be sheep skin however only the center stip was, the outer was synthetic and came off all over my clothes every time I sat on them, also the color was suppose to be Champagne (pale yellow) and it ended up being ""bright"" yellow. I was however very please with the ease of returning and getting a refund on this item."
2,You get what pay for,The seat cover ripped two weeks after installation. Looks good and fits well. Just doesn't hold up. I can't expect alot for 48 dollars.
2,auto seat cover...sheepskin,"The cover I ordered did not fit my car and in trying to get it on, it tore VERY easily...I would have returned it but did not have since I was being a caretaker for a terminally ill family member and a seatcover seemed so insignificant! I would not mail order another."

3,Still waiting,"I would like to review this book, but it is July 3rd and I have not received it yet. It was ordered on June 1st!Still waiting"
1,"don't follow this leader,","Follow the leader seems to be just summarize a bunch of suburban angst. The music seems to be angry for the sake of being angry. There really seems to be anything inovative from Korn on this album, like could be found from their first two album. They play fairly well toghether so it seems like the potential to be good but overall the album is a chore to listen to."
3,Nothing Special,This cd is pretty good but nothing great. It is a one dimentional record with about 4 or 5 good songs.
5,IT RULES!!!!!!,This cd is the bomb!Its got everything you want!Some things a bit mellow and some just turely kick butt!You need to buy this cd if you like kick butt rock
3,What happened?,"This album is such crap compared to the first one they did. There is no emotion, no feeling, no vitality to this record. I loved the passion and intensity of the first album. This one is just a bunch of synth garbage. Gimme some ""Ball Tongue"" and some ""Clown."" Now those songs kicked! And why does this recording not come through like the first one. I felt no energy from this album. I want some ""ROOOOOAAAAAAAARRRRRR!!!!"" You know what I'm saying? Gimme some PASSION again, Jonathan! Word up! Pump me up, baby! You know!!!! --Kelly Magovern"
3,Okay,"Okay, I won't bore you with a really long review about My opinions on every song on this CD and all that, but it's definitely not Korns best album. If your going to buy a Korn album get their first one ""Korn"" or ""Life is Peachy"", or even ""Issues"" but not this CD. It does have ""Freak on a Leash,"" ""Dead Bodies Everywhere"" and a few other really good songs but personally I HATE rap and was really dissapointed to her rap on this CD."
4,*** Fantastic,"I've always thought that Korn blowed big time but now I realise that this is one of the best albums that I have heard. Children of the Korn is the best track on the album by far, but this is followed closely by almost all the others. I would recommend this album to anyone and everyone. Top notch ***!!"
4,good,"When I first listened to ""life is peachy"", it took a while to grow on me, but one shot of ""follow the leader"" and i was INSTANTLY stuck! Check out bodies everywhere"", ""its on"", ""bbk"", and ""got the life"". Also, listen to the hidden remake of cheech and chong's ""earache my eye"" at the end of the album."
2,SELLOUTS!,"Well they've really sold out with this album! If you're a big Korn fan, you can easily tell that they've gone soft compare to their first two albums which I give 5 stars (Buy them if you don't already have them!). The only decent songs in this album are ""Reclaim My Place"", ""Justin"" and ""Earache My Eye"". Jonathan Davis seems to have lost the aggression he once had, and the music sounds to commercial. They might as well do Taco Bell and Pepsi commercials, SELLOUTS!"
3,A Big Leap in Heavy Metal,"I have to admit that this CD is something that's never been done. It mixes disco tunes, rap, and aggressive heavy metal all at the same time. It also has the inside joke of starting the music on track 13. But even though this is good, I would have to say that some of these songs aren't music. It's just a bunch of curses and noises. That is why this has been brought down two points."
1,A SAD DAY FOR MUSIC,"DONT BUY THIS ALBUM, OR ANYTHING ELSE BY THESE BOZOS!!! SAVE YOUR MONEY AND BY SOME MINOR THREAT OR BAD BRAINS RECORDS."
5,THIS ALBLUM IS PEACHY,KORN IS THE BEST ROCK BAND OF OUR GENERTION X. THERE GREAT LEADERS TO LEAD US INTO THIS COLD WORLD. THIS ALBUM SHOWS US THE PATHIC PEOPLE WE ENCOUNTER IN OUR LIVES. I LOVE FREAK ON A LEASH BECUZ IT SHOWS THE DARK SIDE OF MYSELF. DEAD BODIES SHOWS HOW I FEEL ABOUT MY FAMILY SO IF YOU LIKE ME AND NEED A SONG TO CAPTURE YOUR MOOD OR FEELINGS FOLLOW THE LEADER IS IT.
1,Not for true Korn fans,"You've probably heard talking about Korn and how good they are now. But listen close enough to their songs, and you'll find Korn does NOT rock hard enough to even pass Whitney Houston on the loud charts for this album. If you want soft rock- buy follow the leader. If you want true stuff- get life is peachy. peaz- y'all."
1,this is a stupid cd.,My friend has this cd and I hated it. I you like eve 6 the offspring or anyone else like that I would say DO NOT buy this cd. You should buy sugar ray if you want a cd.
1,Money changes everything,It's the new trendy sellout Korn - the one that only wants to make money and forgets about musical creativity and sincere emotions. They put out a soft pop album - now 'N Sync fans have a new favorite group! All poseurs who love MTV should definitely check this out!
5,Excellent,"I don't care what any of these people say about this CD. Don't fall for it, the cd is great. The combination of heavy metal and rap make it one of the great albums of the year."
5,If you like Limp Bizkit you'll love this Korn album!,I know people who would never listen to korn who now give it a hole nother chance.
5,the only cd your ever gonna need,"just get it. its absolutely amazing, and so is the band. jon davis hits topics head on. the way he looks at issues, and then puts them into song is wicked. any teen can relate to some of the things he talks about. not only are the lyrics superb, but the actual sound is just amazing."
1,is it wrong to try good music?,is it even rometely possible for any sick and abnormal teenage korn fan to just once listen to King Crimson and or the Mahavishnu Orchestra? If anyone of you warped teens out there care to comment on this message please feel free to do so
4,Got The Life,"This was the first Korn album I got and is undoubtbly worth the money.This album is brilliant.It may not be the greatest Korn album but is a definite buy and a rock classic.With memorable tunes such as ""Freak on Leash"" (Which has recieved an award for best video) or ""Got The Life"".Even rap sort of tunes:""Children Of The Korn"" Or ""All In The Family"" If you are thinking of getting into Korn, this is the album for you.If your not, Korn are definitely worth trying out they are one of the greatest Heavy Metal groups of the World.This album includes features from Fred Durst in ""All In The Family"" and Ice Cube in ""Children Of The Korn"".This is a need to get album."
4,One of the best!,"Follow the Leader was one of the best albums they've made, but personally I think the self titled album was a lot better. But all in all, this is a lot better then some other album's I've heard."
3,The most overrated band in history...,"Yes, It's true, Korn has become so popular that Elementary school children that have never heard a Korn song in their life are writing ""Korn"" in white out on everything in sight. Although the band IS quite good, they aren't THAT good. THe CD has some good songs, namely, Got the Life, BBK, and Dead bodies everywhere. And for a good laugh, All in the Family is great. But Korn has no originality (Except for All in The Family). Each song sounds the same. They open with the little guiar solo that goes Doo Daaahhhh doo doo Daaahhh WAAAAAY too much. To sum it up, good CD, but I only give credit where it is diserved. If you want a good CD, get some good ol' Green Day, Metallica, and some Offspring, Cause They are the best around."
4,Great!,"This is a truly dark and wonderfull masterpeice. Follow The Leader was Korn break through album. All The songs here are great with awsome arrangments of tuned down 7 string Ibenez guitars, a killer drummer and an insane bass player. Then you have John Davis a great lyricist. I can really realate to the songs on Follow The Leader because I understand what he must have felt like when he wrote 'Dead Bodies Everywear' and 'Freak On The Leash.' This whole album has very personal lyrics but none more personal then 'B.B.K' all the lyrics are realateable to anyone who feels traot and locked up and isolated from the world. This is a very dark and heavy album, though its not Korns best album by far it is still a great Metal album."
2,Hip-Hop Professionals,"These guys are so wicked talented, they practically invented both metal and hip-hop, and do a genius job together melding the two styles!! Plus songs like ""It's On"" and ""Got The Life"" are so brutal... it gets me so pumped up for school... this album still gets me pumped and these guys are mad talented. I would have given it three or maybe four stars if there was less swearing. OK Peace, I'm out!!"
5,No rock band will ever be as good as KoRn!!!!!,"This is a sweet album with lots of great songs like ""Got the Life"", ""Freak on a Leash"", ""Children of the Korn"", ""All in the family"", ect. This is one of the best CD's I've ever got! There is never going to be any rock band better than KoRn! This is there best CD and I guarentee you get it. KoRn rules!"
5,This is AWESOME,This CD kicks butt ya'll. I love the song Freak on a Leash!! Buy this CD if you even like heavy metal the littlest bit.
2,Well....,".I don't think a band sells out every time they change style, and I don't think korn sold out.They simply weakened. It's a halfhearted attempt without the energy of the first album. They lack most of the distinctiveness they once had. Borrow the CD and don't buy it. Some of it is ok and gets you going, but some of it just plain sux. A major disappointment."
3,It's pretty good but a change from earlier albums...,"This is the first Korn album I bought... I really liked it, but when I listened to earlier KoRn it made this one seem a little more ""tame."" The tracks ""It's On,"" ""Got The Life,"" ""Dead Bodies Everywhere,"" and ""BBK"" are good, heavy songs with lots of bass... it's just too bad there isn't more of Fieldy showing through some of that... he is such a great bass player!!(He produced Videodrone's album check it out) I just hope KoRn doesn't do the Limp Bizkit and turn lame.... This album is good for the collection, I recommend it, but a change from their 1st or Life Is Peachy(which isn't bad, all bands change a little)... oh and a warning... Do not listen to the last song... it's the WORST KoRn song I have EVER heard!!! My gift to you??? GIFT?? More like a kick in the nuts.... Jon Davis just whines through the whole thing thinking he can sing.... a terrible way to end an album...."
3,"Good, not as good as the first","KoRn's best CD had to be their fist. Their second (and worst) had to be ""Life is Peachy"" with just one okay song (A.D.I.D.A.S.). This CD is okay with two good songs (""Got the Life"" $ ""Freak on a Leash""). If you can find it cheap you should buy it. I hope their upcomming CD is more like their original."
1,horrrrrrrrrible,Follow the leader is okay if its your first korn but korn and life is peachy are worth listening to.This sucks bad do not buy it if you like Freak On A Leash And Got The Lie those are good songs.But The Rest just plain sucks. Get The singles Got The Life and Freak On A Leash unless you don't mind wasting your money!!!!!!!!!
3,"Ask not who the Big ""L"" stands for, it stands for you.","The first Korn album was the best, but unless you're a nitpicking garage-band guitarist, these guys still rock. Now let's get on with it...So, people who got into Korn after Follow the Leader are posers- why? Is it because they don't waste all their time scouring Circus, Metal Edge and Hit Parader? Sounds to me like the opposite of poser would be loser."
2,"""Follow the Leader"" is strange and disturbing...","KoRn, is, if you ask me, a strange and freakish band that can only be enjoyed by people who are seriosly psychotic. The first twelve tracks have nothing on them, which makes no sense. Then they start of well with the catchy song ""It's On!,"" but ""Freak on a Leash"" is just weird, with the singer in the background making sounds like he's having a seizure. ""Got the Life"" is OK, but ""Dead Bodies Everyhwhere"" is just plain disturbing, with dark, eerie music playing in the background and what appears to be children's music playing in the foreground. It sounds like music for ""Village of the Damned."" ""Children of the KoRn"" is awful, and so is every song after this. I'm glad I didn't buy this album, I just listened to one of my friends CD's. If you like bands like Metallica, Green Day and Lit, I don't think you'll enjoy this."
1,BULL S**T,"This has to be the fakest thing I've seen in a while, First KoRn NEVER offically released the cd this a compalation that amazon made, the did the same thing with Mechanical Animals. Do KoRn a favor and don't buy this one, goto your local music store and buy the real one there"
2,Korny lets leave it at that.....,"this band is still around? and they have a greatest hits package? wat for nobody has really liked korn since 94' and that was 11 years or so. and why is the disc name greatest hits volume one they wont have enough hits to come out with a second disc. i gave korn a chance and so i saw them back in november on there greatest hits tour and that was the worst concert ive ever been to. i mainly went to go see breaking benjamin and skindred who were 10 times better than korn and they played longer than korn! korn were on for only 45 minutes and breaking benjamin had 30 minutse and only played 5 songs! thats just sad, its time to put these old timers to sleep or at least hope someone puts them in a the cheapest home they can find but for now ive given up on this band entirely..."
2,The Beginning of the end for Korn,"Follow the leader was the beginning of the end of kornwith only two good songs, but not much elsethe only thing that is keeping it goodand alive was fieldyotherwise that's it."
1,Could This Possibly Be KoRn?,"Is this really KoRn or is it NSync in disguise? Never in my life could I imagine a band selling out as much as KoRn did on this recording. For all you recent ""fans"" of KoRn who like KoRn because recently KoRn was accepted on MTV (due to the fact they r about the same musically as Hanson) you should wake up and buy the self-titled KoRn cd. Maybe then you will understand what I am saying... Got The Life is about as hardcore as MMMbop and Freak on a Leash is a poor attempt by Jon Davis to prove he didn't sell out with his notorious incoherent babblings...too bad even the babbling are watered down just like the rest of this recording...In other words if you like this release I recommend you go out and buy the Hanson cd along with the Backstreet Boys cause KoRn is now officially gone pop. Anyone with sense go out and buy the self-titled KoRn cd and see what the real KoRn was before the money factor came in. I welcome discussion...."
3,Ehhh.... Well...,"""Korn"" is by far Korn's best album. It's energetic anger, with no break to catch your breath. ""Follow the Leader"" is all right, but it's not as good as ""Life is Peachy"", which wasn't as good as ""Korn"" ... Not bad though, not bad. All in the Family's the best.. hehehe"
4,Would be better if Ice Cube wouldn't have been on the CD,The CD was great except for good old track no. 17. The coolest song is It's On. I find myself lucky that I got my CD autographed by all 5 of them when they came to the Dallas Blockbuster.
4,"not too bad, needs more korn","this is probably korn's 4th best CD. I you don't have ""untouchables"", ""Korn"", or ""life is peachy"" yet I'd hold off on buying this one. Most of the songs are pretty good. my one complaint is that there is too much rap and too many guest appearances. All of the songs that are just straight Korn are good, but the ones with guest appearances kinda [aren't]."
5,One of the Best Rock Albums,"Follow the Leader can be summed up in one word: amazing. This album showed a side of Korn that was never heard before. While their first two albums were very dark and heavy, this album takes a more original road. Unlike other Korn albums, this album has an almost industrial rock sound to it. This time around, the music is still dark and heavy, only it has a more creative and strange sound, making the perfect back-drop for Jonathan Davis's vocals. In my opinion, Jonathan's vocals are at their best on this effort. His voice is filled with rage and a somewhat haunting tone on Follow the Leader, blending in perfectly with the more mature sound Korn displays on this CD."
4,A must own for any Korn Fan,"If you like Korn and don't have this album yet pick it up. There are two rap songs in it. I use to be into those, but now im more into the metal tracks. Some of the songs are quiet eerie on this album.I have had this cd in my collection for five years now and i don't regret getting it. My fav track off this album would have to be freak on a leash this song rocks! I use to listen to this album everyday all day when i was younger. Eventhough this cd is nicked to hell it still plays back okay on my stereo. If your a fan of Korn then you should check out more great bands like Tool,AIC,and Soundgarden. Hell if your into trippy psycheadelic music check out Floyd or The Doors."
3,follow the leader...ok,its on-pretty goodfreak on a leash-awsome! dang awsome!got the life-kool like korn?-?children of the koRn-awsome!bbk-ok?-?all in the family-dissing song-funny-bad-demented!?-?justin-?seed-??-?my gift to you-pretty kool--not! its ok!
2,can you say....sell-out?,"whooooooooey! thanks, KoRn! you just started the WORST era of rock. rap metal! you guys rock! except NOT! ok, their first album was some good stuff. real metal. what happened? this happened! its more bubblegum pop than rock! it disgusts me! ok, several good songs. dead bodies everywhere and reclaim my place. those are the ONLY good songs on this record! its so sad.....so sad the way mtv makes good bands go BAD. REALLY BAD! i cant believe i used to listen to this....thank god i didnt become immersed in the rap-metal scene...if you want REAL music, check out slayer, pantera, anything thats true metal! down with mtv and rap-""metal""!"
1,LIFE IS PEACHY IS BETTER!,"this cd has too much rap in it. There new one issues is too depressing, but in life is peachy is so good because the music is good."
4,KoRn is goin to rock the house,"I think this is one of KoRns best albums. Although I like their first album much more, this one kicks butt. This is definitely brought up my spirits cuz their second album Life is Peachy wasnt so hot. At least with this one you can actually sit down and listen to it without havin 2 skip around cuz all the songs are good like ""All in the Family,"" ""Freak on a Leash,"" and ""Children of the KoRn."""
4,ups and downs,"Alright this cd is great not the best but great the ups are half of the songs are good like seed,got the life and, freak on a leash. The downs are that korn (as everyone knows) is rock not rap sure they are OK in rap but the people who go and buy this cd are buying it for the rock and not the rap and if korn relized that, Maybe theyd stop puttin those rap songs in there and then all the hardcore rock fans like myself and almost all my friends would say hey its all hardcore rock? wow dude im gonna get that! So any ways my in review im gonna give'm a 4 they would have a 5 but there are too many rap songs they should get some lessons from rob zombie holla if ya hear me!"
1,Horrible!,"This CD is horrible. Don't waste your money on this garbage. The lyrics just plain old suck. Freak on a Leash is the only decent song on the CD. I thoght this CD was going to be great, but I was very dissapointed. There are many other great bands out there, so do not waste your money on this crap. This Cd could of been good, but Korn screwed it up.So the bottom line is that this CD sucks."
1,The WORST Metal album....but best RAP album.,Well Korn has Sold out. I am sick of people saying Metallica sold out. Is metallica on MtV everyday? Do girls like Metallica because of the way they look? Does Metallica play Rap music? And did Metallica sell-out? All these questions answers are No. But if you re-word them and put Korns name in the place of Metallicas the answer will be YES. If you want real metal buy every metallica album from Kill'um All to ...And Justice for All. Also buy every Pantera and Ozzy record.
5,rap/rock gods,"koRn's ""FolloW ThE LeadeR"" is awesome that word just describes it the 5 best song on here are (not in order) My Gift To You'""Got the life"" ' ""Dead Bodys Everyhwere""'""children of the cORN""'""its on!"" anywayz its a awesome cd with not a whole lot of cuss words on it but some not as much as a LIMP BIZKIT cdw would have the booklet is pretty cool too with a pic of tha band and its really cool i recomend this cd to anyone who like rock/rap or NÜ metal peace-"
2,Originality is compromised with a speaker full of chaos.,"The riffs sound the same in every song but one. And imagine that, this song is and will be their only chart-topper. Their sound makes it too obvious that they are trying so hard to be unique and hardcore in sound and emotionally deep in lyrics. Quit trying so hard!!!"
5,Korn rules and everyone knows it baby!!!,"Those of you that don't like Korn, listen carefully, KORN IS THE BEST GROUP IN THE UNIVERSE AND YOU KNOW IT SO GO TO THE CLOSEST MUSIC STORE AND BUY THE FREAKIN CD!!!!!!!"
3,Its all gone downhill,"I bought this CD in hopes of hearing some screaming, lots of profanity, and some hard, heavy music. I got some screaming, enough profanity, but not a lot of heavy music. While anything KoRn makes is awesome, Follow the Leader is by far not their greatest album. The self titled album is the best....the closest to the real KoRn one can now get. KoRn has become incredibly famous, and it has probably gone to their heads. I am not saying the CD sucks...most KoRn fans would enjoy it. All in the Family is pretty cool too....but I want the REAL KoRn to come back. The concerts aren't the same anymore...its a sad sad thing."
2,Dissapointed.,"This CD is nothing like the other 3 KoRN CD's. This CD is basically trying to grow a new fan base. So I give them credit, because they did start a new fan base (6X platinum).But this CD is not great at all. It's not as heavy, creative, or original as the other 3 KoRn CD's. This CD is full of rap and hip-hop, and I'm not into that kind of music. Songs like ""Children Of The KoRn"", ""All In The Family"", and ""Cameltosis"" are almost totally rap.The only good songs on this CD are ""It's On"", and ""Seed"". I don't reccomend this CD at all."
5,Korn's best cd!,"Follow the leader is korn's best cd! the best songs are freak on a leash,got the life, and dead bodies everywhere! overall Korn's follow the leader is a must buy for any Korn or rock fan!"
3,GOOD.,"This album was good. Not great but just plain good. My favorite song on this album is ""All In The Family"". I thought that song was funny as hell. And ""Freak On a Leash"" is also very good. ""Dead Bodies Everywhere"" is pretty tight. If you're a Korn fan then you'll probably love this CD. I have heard better than this but this album is still enjoyable."
4,Decent,"everyone says that ""Life is Peachy"" or ""Issues"" is the downfall of Korn. I dont think so. I think ""Follow the Leader"" is. Its still a good album. but its not as in depth as the others. there something evident on each album that reflects the band. this one though, seems a little spaced out. Of course Freak on a Leash and Got the LIfe are the best songs. I love BBK as well. but songs like Pretty, and Justin, and Cameltosis, are just [strange] songs. they aren't really needed. despite fred durst being a moron, All in the Family is a riot in my opinion as well is the Earache my Eye hidden track. . Its definitely a good album. but it could have been better."
5,Best Korn CD ever!,"This is there best album.Every song is great and Jonathan Davis rules.The last 15 minutes of the last track is laughbly hilarious, well atleast I thought it was.I thought this album was a tad bit better then Issues.Overall this is one of the best albums ever to come out in the early 90's.Get it. The music in this is awesome.Every song is great and powerful in there own ways. Like freak on a leash and more. All these songs are great.Check it out..Later..."
5,BEST KORN CD!!!,okay this is the best CD byn KORN ever.I love this one.its my favorite KORN CD.you have to buy it.if you would like to ge to know some good metal music by Korn or jsut get to know some good metal music the this CD is just perfect for your listening littlle ears.I love this CD more than anything and out of all the KORN cds that i got.you cannot like KORN if you do not know this CD by them.ITS KICK A**!!!Buy it.
1,One of the worse.,"This is one of the worst hard/metal whatever you want to call CDs I own, and I own well over 700 metal CDs. This CD is a major letdown from the freshness and the rawness of the original KoRn album, this now sounds completely like a studio band, way too tame and not melodic or inventive enough to be tame. Only can hope they find their edge again and not so much after a more sale friendly sound."
1,KORN 's album bites!,Bodies everywhere is a stroke (off) of pure genius! Who would've thought two words could be said many times to form such an articulate sentence. This band is for lamers who feel a need to ACT rebelious even though they're like lemmings falling over the cliff.
1,these guys are untalented.........,"I liked one song back in 95 ....blind..... since then i have seen what these guys stand for and have seen the ""music"" they put out..... these guys are aweful..... the music is boring and old already,,,, wake up .....rap/rock is dead let it rot in peace...."
1,Don't bother,"This is what happens when a record company says a band is good and everybody blindly believes it's true. You'll get lots of grunting, sloppy guitars and vocals, but very little music. This album is a mess."
1,WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?,"how can this even be considered music? I have tried to get into the whole ""yell at the top of your lungs obscenities"" thing, but I just can't. People who can stand this kind of music for long periods of time need help. All this band is is a bunch of guys that have one thing in common; extreme emotional problems from the past. If they're not already saying now, in ten years they're going to be asking themselves why everyone liked them so much. It's a mystery to me. I'm only putting one star because that is required."
1,Reeks,"This album reeks. It's nothing but incoherent noise and obscene lyrics. The state of popular music today is pathetic. It doesn't even deserve to be called music, that's how bad it is."
1,"What Garbage, I wish I could give it zero stars","Follow the Leader is the worst cd I have ever heard. It sounds like a bunch of halfwits bashing guitars over eachothers' heads while screaming into a microphone. Worst yet I saw the band perform at woodstock 99 and the lead ""screamer"" was wearing a skirt and a purse. Get a real taste in music and please don't buy this album."
5,"Korn rocks, especially Follow the Leader","This Cd has some great songs as well as a bunch of good songs. You have probably heard ""Freak on a Leash"" and ""Got the Life"". The other songs on this Cd are just like it and great to listen to. It is in competition with Korn self-titled debut album for the right to claim itself as Korn's best. If you like Rob Zombie, Incubus, or P.O.D., this album is right for you. This is a definite must have for all Korn and Hard Rock fans."
5,a great uderratted cd,as i said in my life is peachy review korn is one of the best rock band ever now follow the leader is not as great as ther otther cds but is still good i dont know why people think this cd is so bad i mean it rocks espcally dead bodies everywhear. korn kicks ass
2,Not as good as their first,"This has already been said, but let me emphasize it for the zillionth time....KORN DID NOT START THIS RAP-ROCK TREND! BEASTIE BOYS & RAGE AGAINST THE MACHINE DID, SO GIVE THEM SOME CREDIT! Anyway, about this cd, like I said...just NOT as good as their first...couple of cool songs, like ""Freak on a Leash"" (esp. the video) & ""Got the Life"". But they should've thought twice about hooking up with Ice Cube...& although I like some of their songs, I gotta agree with a previous review...to sum it up, this band just has MEDIOCRE, if ANY musical talent...maybe if they just brushed up on their musical skills, they'd be worth all the hype their getting, but there's just not enuff talent here! If yer a musician, you should know that already."
3,Just not Rockin enough,"I was mildly entertained by Korn's latest, but I found that it lacked the Raw Fist-Pumping adrenaline rush of bands like Winger or Poison. Man when someone puts some Stick it to ya by Slaughter on the ol tape player I just come unglued. Better put the valuables away cuz Im going on a thrashing Rampage. The same goes for Skid Row. Now those guys could rock. I just dont get the same feeling from Korn. They seem more soft like a Night Ranger type girl band."
4,Good but not their debut good,"This is a good album,not average,not great,just good. The best song on this album is ""B.B.K."".Everyone credits KoRn for being the best at everything they do.Jon is a good singer but Chino Moreno of the Deftones is better.Fieldy is a good bass player but Les ""The God of bass"" Claypool is a million times better,and he sure as hell ain't better looking than Melissa of Hole. Head and Munky kick *** but seem to be getting slower on their guitars.David is an amazing drummer but for some reason he doesn't get a chance to display it as much as the first two albums.""Life is Peachy"" is still my favorite, even though it lacks ""Blind"". One last thing is Jonathon's song writing is getting worse. He is trying to be sarcastic and cool but Kurt Cobain was the only one to ever pull that off."
3,listen and see for yourself,"This Cd has a few good songs, but the first cd remains the best. I suuggest you listen to it before you buy it and see for yourself"
1,Nasty,This is the worst music I have ever listened to. I can't believe people put this stuff on the shelves!
5,The Best!,"I falled in love with Korn when i first listened to 'Freak On A Leash' song. But when i listened the whole album, i felt like this is it. This is what i'm looking for in music. Totally out of this world of music type. Full of energy and 'music'."
3,"Not a Korn fan, but this CD is OK","I am not a Korn fan, as far as this type of music is concerned, I prefer Linkin Park and Limp Bizkit. I borrowed this CD from a friend just to see what it sounded like. After listening to it all day at work, I can say it is not nearly as bad as I thought it would be. I listen to everything from ABBA to ZZ Top and everything in between, and will give anything a chance at least once. The songs on here that seemed really hard to listen to 7 years ago when this CD came out seem somewhat tame now that I am used to listening to this type of music. I guess they were ahead of their time. Anyway, it has not convinced me to be a diehard Korn fan, but this CD is certainly worth a listen if you like this type of grunge metal."
3,this is korns worst album,"it just lacked the fire that all the other albums have. if you wanna buy a korn cd go buy their 1994 self titled debut album. its far superior to all the others. dont get me wrong it was a good album, for a while, after listening to the album about 5 times all the way through i threw the cd on to my stack of cd's and just kind of left it there. its just not as good as the others. peace! rock the house yall!"
2,"These guy are ok, but that's about all!","If you want heavy gituar rock, then get some real stuff, like Van Halen! At least those guys knew how to play the gituar 10 minutes before they got on stage!"
1,This CD isnt worth it,I cant stand Korn..All they do is scream..They have no talent at all..Dont waste your money on this CD you can get a better CD with that money!!
5,It rocks and it blow away any other bands out now!,"Korn's album Follow The Leader is the best cd out for 1999. All the tracks are great and the best songs are It's On!,Freak On A Leash,Got The Life,Children Of The Korn,and All In The Family. The lylics rock for every track. Korn's new cd is the best cd yet. This is the best cd to have when going to a party or when you are having a party and is the best music to blast at a friends house when his parents are not home. The cover of album rocks and the bass players really really rock in ""Freak On A Leash"" song. If you have time buy the Korn's new cd Follow The Leader it rocks and its worth buying the the cd."
5,KoRn Gots Da Life,This is the first KoRn C.d I have and I LOVE it!!!!!!!KoRn is the best band!!!!!!!!!This C.d made me want to buy Life is Peachy!!!
4,Definatly getting better,"Well, I must admit, I was totally not a Korn fan before this, I thought they needed some work, being they were bringing out some amature music, but ""Follow the Leader"" is definatly a good CD. I highly recomend this Cd over their last 2."
5,"Follow me, the leader, and go buy this cd!","If I could pick the top three best KoRn albums, they would be their self titled debut (KoRn), Take A Look In the Mirror, and this one, Follow the Leader. This is one truly awesome cd. Some songs are dark with sad lyrics(Check out the song ""Pretty Face"") while others have humor in them (The song ""All In the Family"", anyone?). There are special guests artists on this cd. You might be suprised that they are hip-hop artists like Ice Cube, but they sound suprisingly good on this cd. This is one of the heaviest KoRn cds. Most of the songs are great, if not all. The cover art is also very good too. Its also interresting that the music starts on track 13... Actually I wish that it was normal and just started like the rest of the cds, and I don't see the point of that, but whatever... Go out and get this cd. Its one of the main reasons why I like nu metal."
3,it ain't da best KoRn cd,"After being a long time KoRn fan i think i gots the power to rate dis cd. I ain't one of dem peeps who hear ""Got the Life"" and say ""OHHHHH!! KoRn is sooo cooool"" ""They're hip and they're in!!!"" I've like KoRn reguard less of what da damn radio plays!!! I think this album don't come from da heart like their udder cds did. They're lacking power and aren't like they were in they're cd before like in their self titled cd KoRn and in their Life is Peachy cd. Those cds have power!!!! they come from the heart and speak of real life situations. So all in all this cd is ok but don't gots da power that their cds before did. Ya want a good album????? Buy KoRn or Life is Peachy."
2,1st album=awesome/2nd=ok/3rd=do you see where it's headed,The 1st Korn album was absolutly an explosion of the best music I've ever heard. The second album was ok not nearly as good as the first but held onto good riffs and sounds. As the #rd came they lost it they produced crap and went down many points on my scale and I've been listening to hardcore all my life.
4,This cd is GREAT when you need to scream.,"Despite what the other, more ""profressional"" reviewers may say, Korn will deffinitely go down in the books as a group who has changed music. Any that cannot see how Korn has brought a new era of kill-em-all music needs to get the bifocals cleaned. I love this cd. The song ""freak on a leash"" describes how it feels to be in a gotta-get-out situation. Great to scream along with when angry at whoever. ""Got the life"" is a great coloboration of vocal harmonies and angst. This cd is DEFINITELY worth the money and space in your collection."
2,Trash,"This Record has almost no energy, its clear that Johnathon Davis has become drunk with his stardom... its like when the Doors released the Soft Parade. A week effort, with only a few songs showing any remote signs of energy---All In the Family, because of Fred Durst, and Its On."
5,KoRn!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This Album is Unbelievable!!!!!!!! A lot of people said that they were gonna change for their next album, but not one bit! Everything on it kicks! The appearances from other artists are great too. This entire album is great and i dont have a single complant for it. Their old stuff was great, and their new is just as unbelievable! Get the CD and GO SEE THE FAMILY VALUES TOUR!!!!"
5,BEST ALBUM EVER,"This is the best album ever. It tops Life is Peachy and Korn and its quite different. I dont like the fact that theyve been heading a more hiphop direction than metal, but its still a killer. To those who say they shouldnt compare Korn with Deftones or Limp Bizcuit, youre right. They shouldnt compare them with bands they practically gave life to, as good as they may be."
1,NOT METAL,"METAL IS SEPULTURA PANTERA TOOL METALLICA DEICIDE ROB ZOMBIE MEGADETH. THEY ARE FA@ETS WHO PLAY SH1TTY BLACK ""RAP""."
1,KoRn = The Biggest Sellout of All Time,"Never in my life could I imagine a band selling out as much as KoRn did on this recording. For all you recent ""fans"" of KoRn who like KoRn because recently KoRn was accepted on MTV (due to the fact they r about the same musically as Hanson) you should wake up and buy the self-titled KoRn cd. Maybe then you will understand what I am saying... Got The Life is about as hardcore as MMMbop and Freak on a Leash is a poor attempt by Jon Davis to prove he didn't sell out with his notorious incoherent babblings...too bad even the babbling is watered down just like the rest of this recording...In other words if you like this release I recommend you go out and buy the Hanson cd along with the Backstreet Boys cause KoRn is now officially gone pop. Anyone with sense go out and buy the self-titled KoRn cd and see what the real KoRn was before the money factor came in."
1,what is there to say?,"it's depressing to see that this is what music has evolved into. i enjoy bands like the smashing pumpkins who have been influenced by the classic musicians like hendrix/zeppelin/floyd/sabbath etc. where does korn come from? rap and death metal, and you have to admit they are two of the worst types of music you're ever going to hear. enough said."
1,they stink,"i dont see how anyone can listen to this batch of posers and a weak excuse for metal. They are now just like the backstreet boys. Ok white zombie is phat but korn, limp bizkit and deftones are just trendy followers of a teeny trend. their first album was ok but since that they have totally sold out. This music is NOT metal at all. Real metal is pantera, iced earth, dismember, suffocation, nile, obituary, carcass, sepultura, entombed, sevendust,cryptopsy, slayer, testament and soulfly. these guys are posers who suck each other. dont get this cd."
5,This is Heavy Rock/Rap the way it was meant to be,"Ever since their first album Korn has been producing some great sounds and this album is no exception. If you're into bands like Rage Against the Machine and Limp Bizkit - both of which can't nearly match Korn in sheer intensity - and you don't mind the plethora of swearing, you'll love Korn's latest offering. IMHO, the best song on the album is ""Dead Bodies Everywhere"", but the CD as a whole is great."
3,ok,OK the cd was good not as good as limp bizkit but it was good. All in the family kicks i love that song! Got the life was good too. freak on a leash isn't really that good but i'll listen to it. Either way if I have a Limp Bizkit or Korn cd with me then im happy. It's all good...
5,great but different,"this is like an awesome cd, its very structured and has lotsa techno and hip hop junk thrown in with the guitars and good vocal arrangements, its not near as agressive or grungy or heavy as the earlier stuff but its still really cool, there is one problem i have with it, everyone calls it rap metal but its not really rap metal if they don't RAP, they only rap like mabey 2 or 3 songs, its more like heavy pop music"
2,Not as good as you would think.,"I listened to Follow The Leader, and frankly, it sucked. There were very few listenable tracks that had a catchy chorus and good beat. It was all jumbled words and music. Not a good combination. It makes you wonder how they have a huge fanbase. ""Dead Bodies Everywhere"", ""Freak On A Leash"", and ""Got The Life"" are actually good tracks, but the rest is mediocre. How can they even be compared to Limp Bizkit, whose new album is probably one of the best I've ever heard. Follow The Leader pales in comparison to 1994's self titled debut. For adrenalin pumped live performances, Korn is the band, but for GOOD, catchy tracks, and great albums, look elsewhere."
1,nu-metal garbage,"This is the difinitive nu-metal album to me (and thats why it sucks). It is abosolute garbage, the only good song is 'freak on a leash'. There is zero talent in this band other than the johnathan davis, who should quit and find a real metal band. Terrible cd"
2,THIS IS DUMB MUSIC 1.5 stars.,"Hey, this KORN is very overrated stuff. Just slow downtuned primitive chords with sound effects, basist and drummer are nothing special too.Singer is not an artist he is a poser! Whiny and stuped vocals!This s^^t may be catchy, but more in a Britney Spears way.I listened it, like twice and third time I skip 80-90 percent of the CD. Music is horrible, slow and stuped!And not creepy.Morbid Angel is much more creepy=====))))) lolI like Korn with beans and tomatoes!!??/"
1,What the F*CK!?!!,"This Cd s*cks my white, hairy A**!!! Who the H*ll would buy this piece of sh*t!! Probably the people who commit suicide or people who have absolutely no f*ckin' taste!!If this is in your home, you S*CK!!!!"
5,KORNS BEST CD,"I know everyone says that this cd is too much like pop but it has some brilliant songs. Especialy It's on, freak on a leash, pretty, seed and got the life. I definatly recomend this cd."
1,BUY THIS!,"If you want boring and annoying lyrics then this is your album! Full of screechy guitar riffs and cheesy drumming...Forget this CD! This is not REAL KoRn! Tisk,Tisk S-E-L-L-O-U-T! Not only does this CD have no emotion, the videos are played 10 times a day. I am not saying KoRn is not a good band, I honestly think they could have an awsome next album. Until then, buy their first cd AND NOT THIS ONE! If you want music with emotional lyrics and unique drumming and guitar, buy any tool album. Oh,Yeah...Ozzy RULES!"
2,KoRn will never be the same!,"KoRn sold out! The worst song is ""Children of the KoRN!"" It's rap! Plus, how can they call their tour ""Rock is Dead?"" If you wat real KoRn, buy the debut or Life is Peachy!"
4,Another KoRny album,"This is a good change in KoRn's style, a little bit more melody this time. I think this is much better than the first album. My favourites are It's On and Cameltosis. I recommend this to every hard rock fan."
2,I've heard better,"To be quite honest I found this cd mundane and completely annoying I reccomend korn, life is peachy and Issues but this is complete rubbish from a band on most occasions a lot of talent."
4,...Powerhouse..,"...Follow the Leader starts out with a bang. Pure mayhem and Power in the first 5 or 6 tracks; but after the intial blast of a wonderfully metallically written and performed start, the album kinda dies off as it hits the hip-hop tracks and falters some more before the record ends. Overall, half of it is amazing, the other half merely mortal..."
4,"KoRn, listen to the words!","You may think KoRn is for freaks and deadheads, but if you listen to the meanings to the songs, I think you will change your mind. ex. Got the Life is about the record company making KoRn a show. just to make the company rich. Dead Bodies Everywhere is about Jons Father telling him not to be a Musician. Justin is about a cancer kid, who was dying and made a wish to see koRn. How bad can they be if they made a song about him? come on!"
4,Why is KORN DOING SOFTER?,"Come on members of KoRn! You all are being turned into zombies on looking all pretty and nice when you all started you didn't look that well,you looked sick and unheathy, you were also alot better! I do like this CD but I wish The band will come back to heavy metal , not pop! I recommed the 1st CD of KoRn."
3,Following The New?,Follow The Leader Is...different from the other albums it's more tecno and isn't like their self-titled album and Life Is Peachy. I like only four songs basically but they did better with Issues...way better.
3,Dissapointing,"I got the cd as a gift, so I listened to it a few times. It seems the boys from Korn have gotten lazy, and the best songs on here are the ones that have guest appearances by far better artists."
3,after time...,"got the life was the first time that id heard korn and i was immeadiatly hooked. i had finally found something heavy that wasnt satanic. but having heard korn and life is peachy i realize how differnt this cd is for thier other music. for one its much less origional as the other cds and is geared towards sales. saying that, pretty is one of my alltime favorite songs by korn.it has several special apperences by mucicians like fred durst of limp bizkit,tre hardson of pharcyde and ice cube.if your looking for something a little easier to digest buy this cd."
5,Only one dimensional people do not like this album.,"This CD is so versitile it kicks a--! I love all the different tracks. I'm a fan of many types of music and KoRn does a perfect blend between hip-hop and rock. Only people that just want to stay cooped up in one form of music are too blind to notice that KoRn is, and mind me for using the poser word, da bomb."
3,KORN AND LIFE IS PEACHY ARE WAAAAAAAAAY BETTER,"If you're looking for your first KoRn album, get the self titled or Life is Peachy--THATS GOOD MUSIC, Follow The Leader went mainstream and now I've lost a little respect for KoRn. Also, don't depend too much on the sound clips on Amazon, THE FIRST 5 SONGS ARE THE ONLY GOOD ONES!! It's On! Freak On a Leash, Got The Life, Dead Bodies Everywhere, and Children of the KoRn are great songs.. but the others suck some major ***."
1,Sell-outs,"This album is horrible. If i had the chance,i wouldn't even give it a single star. Their first album was brilliant. But this album is boring,predictable,homogenous,and lacking the passion and intensity this once-fine band had.....i don't know what happened. They just lost it. Korn 1993-1997 R.I.P."
1,"""You'd be better off with aquarium gravel""","If you're looking for musical talent and witty, thoughtful lyrics, you'd be better off with aquarium gravel than with this waste of plastic and packaging. Unchanging hip-hop beats, a wall of stompboxes, and at times whiny, at others bloodthroaty vocals make up the bulk of Korn's Follow the Leader. The lyrics are by far the worst part of the album, being meaningless blither-blather, with the word ""hate"" and profanity sprinkled liberally to make it oh-so-hardcore. A prime example is the track ""All in the Family,"" a bitchfest between Jonathon Davis of Korn and Fred Durst of Limp Bizkit which is so embarrassing, I'm left to wonder why both aren't laughed offstage at any of their concerts. If I wanted to hear whiny voices and immature verbal abuse, I would've gone back to Junior High."
1,nothing,"I think Reel big Fish said it best ""Sell out!, with me oh yeah, sell out!, with me tonight...record companies gonna give me lots of money and everythings gonna be alright""."
3,Above Average.,"Follow The Leader isn't my favorite, it's better than average but that's it. However there are several good tracks like All In The Family, Freak On A Leash, Reclaim My Place, It's On and BBK. I'm a fan of Korn but they have much better albums like their '94 self-titled debut and '96 Life Is Peachy, a lot of people said that they sold out here but their '99 follow-up Issues is far better, then comes '02 follow-up Untouchables which is better than Issues. I hardly ever listen to it and it's their worst '90s release by far. Too much pop and mainstream influences, their music gets too light and bland here."
3,Get this............,"if you want to hear the death (aka Commercial Mainstream birth) of a once-great band. I was the guy waiting in line @ midnight to buy this CD when it was released. If you are under 20 then you're too young to know what I'm talking about, and that's not your fault. Korn's first 2 albums are blistering hard. There's nothing wrong with a band trying new things, but for the most part this album was a way of telling old Korn fans that the band they know and love is dead. Millions of dollars later, for some odd reason they haven't gone back to the sound that built a fanbase to begin with, 12 (*gasp* I'm old) years ago. Enjoy it, guys. See you on the Other Side is your swan song. And if not, hopefully the kids that thought THIS album was good (poor tykes don't know any better) will let you know the deal. RIP."
5,"i like korn, korn tastes good","when i fist bought the cd i wonderd why the songs stated at 13, the when i finally got to hear it, i thougth it was odd that for the first 12 songs were 7 seconds long. but when it got to (13)its on! i was shocked, korn totally changed, from adidas and good god to a eriee metal sond. i loved the song, when (14)freak on a leash started it changed my consept of the cd but i kept listening. it was great on of the best of korn, followed up by (15)Got the life and (16)dead bodies everywhere it became my favorite cd that i had by korn. the only song i was disapointed in was, (17)childern of the korn feat. Ice Cube. i thought they could of done a better job, buy even then it was a good song. it was a great cd. one of the best of 90's, it is easly a contender for best rock/alternative album of the year. its a must have even if korn isnt one of your favotie bands just put tape over the band title on the cover."
4,Something for everyone,"This is Korn's worst album because of Children of the Korn, Cameltosis, and Pretty. All the other songs are cool, though. For first-timers there's Freak on a Leash (hugely popular), Got the Life (best single),B.B.K., and All in the Famly. However, the rest of the album is for the original fans. Seed and My Gift to You have some of the best riffs Korn's ever done, while Dead Bodies Everywhere is good enough to be a single. And the other songs are cool, too. This is an album for an original fan or a newbie. GET THIS CD!"
2,Worse then Issues,"This CD is truly a disgrace for Korn. They use screams, distorted junk, simple grunge guitars, and terrible bass. David on the drums really isn't so bad, but everything else is lacking in talent. To make it even worse all the lyrics are dumb and pointless.Some people say it takes time, well it took me time just to get into Got the Life.Good tracks: got the Life, All in the Family, and bonus track.Remember, this is my opinion. Don't blame me for it."
1,KORNY,I really dislike everything this band stands for. They're like the Back Street Boyz on caffeine. And this record of theirs is just utter garbage. Try something really good like the new Mariah Carey or Paula Cole albums instead.
3,KoRn is pretty cool for a new band.,"KoRN is pretty cool,but they rap to much other than that they kick butt.All of the songs on this album are great! Freak on a leash I think is the best song on it."
3,For alternative it's really good.,"First of all, Korn have done a good job at recreating and refreshing their own sound. Another cd in the style of ""Life is Peachy"" would have been boring. Still, it !*%#^ to have 13 free tracks before the cd really starts because that's a no-no for the oh-so-nice random button on your cd-player. It's certainly one of the best alternative albums out there and Korn are one of the best groups playing that kind of music (although most of my friends disagree) but I wonder what Korn are to do with metal? Just as much as Puff Daddy or Mariah Carey. Simply nothing."
5,Excellent!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This music is the best music you will be able to find anywhere. Anyone who doesn't buy it will have a heck of a hrad time trying to find a better band.
1,A socialite sell-out of bourgoise ideals!!!,"From the outset 'Follow the Leader' evokes a plea for rigorous self-examination and suggests an indictment on intellectual hypocrisy. The blatent Socratic irony of the lyrics and Davies' macabre howl create an almost paradoxical antithesis which, at its climax, borders on the exquisite. However it seems that one cannot escape the overwhelming sense that this album is a plate of POO POO served with a side salad of WEE!"
2,What happened to the power?,"All I can say is, It's gone! The power, the passion, the rage!! If your desperatly looking for something with the same intensity of Korn's first album check out SYSTEM OF A DOWN, SNOT, DEFTONES, DOWNSET, even Zebrahead has more to offer than this. If this is your first exposure to Korn I strongly suggest you check out their first effort there's truly no comparison!!!"
5,KoRn backwards is nRoK........think about it,"This is THE best KoRn cd to date! My favorite song is ""Pretty."" I can not wait until their new album comes out. I say buy this cd. You won't regret it!"
1,"Sell-Outs and Posers, buy this",I gotta say that I used to be a KoRn fan since LAPD back in '91. This and their last CD is CRAP! MTV always finds a way to screw things up. I cant blame KoRn for the rise in popularity but the unpopularity is what made these guys good. Now its all sell-outs and they forgot about the true fans
5,KoRn are Awesome!,"This is an awesome CD! All of KoRn's best songs are on it, such as Got the Life, Freak on a Leash, Children of the KoRn and All in the Family, which has a guest appearance by Fred Durst from Limp Bizkit. This is a really heavy album and I would reccomend it to anyone who likes KoRn, Limp Bizkit, Ice Cube or any other similar bands. It rocks!"
5,Korn is better than ever,"Korn's first self entitled album was pretty cool. Their second album Life is Peachy was even better. But the Follow the Leader is the best one of them all. Some of their best songs are on the album. Songs like ""Got the Life"", ""Children of the Korn"", ""All in the Family"",and ""Freak on a Leash"" are all good songs. To put it all together Korn has come a long way to being a simple rock band to a band that fans really admire."
1,NEVER HAS A WORD DESCRIBED A BAND SO WELL,Korny Korny Korny Korny Korny Korny Korny Korny Korny Korny Korny Korny Korny Korny Korny Korny Korny Korny Korny Konry Korny Korny
2,Korn slowly going the way of the Bizkit...not a good thing,"Korn sounds less and less like Korn on this album and more and more like....nothing...most of these songs have absolutely no identity whatsoever, and only a handful have any memorable moments. Children of the Korn is pathetic...what happened to the early days when Korn actually had melodies that you could sing?"
4,Korn rulez!,"I have the Korn Cd ""Follow the Leader"" and it is so cool!!!!! I recommend this to anyone! Freak on a Leash rulez!"
2,I like my korn with peas and carrots,These rest of these idiots should follow Head and find Jesus then descend into obscurity. Big musical stretch playing nothing but bar chords and making silly sound effects.
2,?,"I think the lyrics could have been better! this is purely a commercial album, made for teenagers in USA!"
2,Commercialized Music for the Masses,"Of all the KoRn albums released, this is by far the worst. If you started to listen to KoRn back in 94-95 then you know what they are supposed to sound like. This ""Produced"" album is terrible. Off the top of my head i know that at least 3 songs are with other bands, and they are bad. I bought this they day it came out, tried to like it for 2 weeks, and threw it in the closet. I think this should have been called KoRn and Friends"
2,What the hell is this!,"I really want to give this album one star. Or zero stars. It's so trendy and popular and ever-so-hardcore. It IS pretty hard, which is what gives it marginal merit. If all you're looking for is some hard music with inane lyrics, by all means jump on the Korn bandwagon that seems so fashionable these days. I, for one, prefer my hardcore served with decent lyrics that I don't have to read the liner notes to understand. And preferably delivered by someone with at least as much singing ability as a stuck pig. Korn is none of this. Korn is good background noise, and nothing more."
1,"sub-par ""metal"" for kids","I heard all of the hype surrounding Korn a while back, so I went out and listened to their new album ""Follow the Leader"". I came away from it wondering how anyone could consider this band good, much less ""the best ever"". The have been around for what, all of 5 years now? Really. What this album is, is a group of not-very-talented guys banging around on their seven-string guitars (gasps of awe from the kiddies here)shouting obscenities with all of the subtlety of a jackhammer. I mean, if this is the best band ever, we're in trouble. If you want real Heavy Metal, try classic groups like Black Sabbath and Judas Priest. If you want rank amatuers that will be forgotten in 5 years, then by all means ""Follow the Leader""."
1,"Corn is NOT spelled with a ""K""","This is their worst album yet. Which is surprising considering how bad their previous efforts have been. These guys have somehow outdone themselves this time. And by the way Amerika's youth have embraced this silly group of girls, I can honestly say we are doomed."
1,"Needed the jewel case, the cd is a great cup holder!","I bought the cd 2 years ago or something like that. What a dissapointment. I spent $... on it, what the hell was I thinking? I forgot about the cd shortly after I purchased it... recently I found it, so I took all the inserts out and used the jewel case to replace a cracked case for one of my other cd's. I dunno what I did with the Korn Follow the leader inserts and cd, maybe they *mistakenly* ended up in the trash can? To sum it all up, I paid $... for a jewel case."
2,"Korn,Too much fashion and too much boring",I never listen a cd with musics so boring in my life.Is not heavy and is not good.Remenber you guys CANNIBAL CORPSE FOREVER !
4,KoRn's most popular... but KoRn's best?,"Good album...somewhat simplistic musically...and not quite as lyrically deep as the self-titled debut...but listenable. The tunes lack the quirkyness [which I personally favor] of those in Life is Peachy, but still a good effort."
5,My Review to You,"This Cd is the best by KoRn. The Self-Titled is the best one. Life Is Peachy was horrible. Issues was just okay. I hate the blank tracks 1-12. It gets annoying as hell skipping all that way just to get to the music. It's On was a cool opener. Freak On A Leash was awesome. Got The Life makes me want to break dance or something. Dead Bodies Everywhere is a cool song. Children Of The KoRn...was not good. Jonathan, If you are reading this, dont do rap. BBk is an awesome song too. Pretty is cool. I am still adjusting to it. All In The Family is hillarious!! Reclaim My Place is my second favorite track. Justin is just okay. Seed is my favorite track on the whole Cd. I love it when Jonathan goes crazy. Camelotis is just alright. My Gift To You is my third favorite track. I always hated bagpipes but when i hear this song its not so irratating. The secret track is cool. Definatly buy this Cd."
2,the worst release by korn,"a very bad album.the only good songs on the album were dead bodies everywhere and pretty.korn lost all the heaviness they once had. wheres the heavy korn sound?ever heard of devine or good god? those were the real korn songs, this is really bad."
5,"GREAT, BUT NOT THEIR BEST","KORN IS THE GREATEST BAND OF ALL TIME. THE RAW POWER THEY HAD ON THEIR FIRST 2 ALBUMS HAS SLIGHTLY FADED. THERE ARE MORE SPECIAL EFFECTS ON THIS ALBUM THEN SHOULD. SONGS LIKE SEED, DEAD BODIES EVERYWHERE, AND RECLAIM MY PLACE MAKE THE ALBUM. KORN NEEDS TO BE MORE LIKE THEY WERE BEFORE, BUT THEY'RE STILL THE BEST F'N BAND OUT THERE. KORN#1111111111111111111111111111111111111"
4,Korn's best,"This is Korn's best CD hands down. Freak on a Leash and Got the Life are great songs, but the best songs on the album are ones that I don't hear too many people talk about: Justin, Seed, and Cameltosis. Check them out!"
1,Junk.,"Korn proves their contempt for the English language by releasing another crudly written, confusing, grating opus. Juxtaposing their prosaic junk next to a bunch of jarring guitars only kills enjoyment for me. What messages are they trying to convey? Oh yeah, I almost forgot, once their album sells a geegol, they drag a bunch of vacant subhumans out on tour will them and dub their tour ""Family values?"" Confused? That makes a two of us."
1,To be Korny or not to be korny?,This Cd is like running backwards through a cornfield naked. Good at the beginning and bad in the end. The bands taste of music was good when it first came out and now it has taken a swift turn into mediocricy.
1,doesn't work,"it must be seller's fault, i bought this used as new, the product came in time, box, booklet and cd were in perfect conditions, buy neither, my laptop, car and suv cd player couldn't play it.. it plays like 5-7 secs of silence per track and that's it, i'm not gonna rate the seller yet, i contacted them and expecting a solution"
1,Sheep Love KoRn,"korn is just a terrible band, period. Korn's sheep are nothing but a bunch of mindless teenage scum who think that this ""Mall Metal"" sound is hardcore metal but it is really just a bunch of garbage. Jonathan Davis does a great job at whining, Munky & Head play the same power chords over and over again (and teens think these two morons are legends LMAO), Fieldy has to be the WORST bassist I have ever heard in the history of music, And Silveria just plain sucks, posting for a CK ad? FAG. He is just a terrible drummer. These idiots should be flipping burgers at McDonalds and across the street at Burger King, Limp Bizkit should be cleaning floors. Death to mall metal & rap!"
1,for guys who own Olds Cutlass/Buick Regal/Chevy Monte Marlo,"If you drive an mid 80's model Olds Cutlass/Buick Regal/Chevy Monte Marlo you will love this album. If you put chrome trim on your wheel wheels of your mid 80's Olds Cutlass/Buick Regal/Chevy Monte Marlo, you will especially love this album. If you have lowered your mid 80's Olds Cutlass/Buick Regal/Chevy Monte Marlo and put low profile tires also you will listen to this album as you cruise around looking for KoRn girls. If you wear a KoRn t-shirt while driving your mid 80's Olds Cutlass/Buick Regal/Chevy Monte Marlo, you must have this album, it is the law! If you have a KICKER or No Fear sticker on the back of your mid 80's Olds Cutlass/Buick Regal/Chevy Monte Marlo, you must have this album. You get bonus points if you hang out with your buddies in the parking lot of the wal-mart with their mid 80's Olds Cutlass/Buick Regal/Chevy Monte Marlo while listening to this album. quix"
1,"corn belongs on a cob, dude....","but you posers who think you like metal because you listen to this? make me bad. firstly, corn limpy biskit, disturd, stinkin' park are not metal. They can't even play their instruments. They cover up for their inability to play by hammering the same chords out constantly, and their 'singer' covers up for his lack of talent by screeching and howling, and whining. You don't get proper metal bands like Iron Maiden whining 'Nobody loves me...' because Iron Maiden can actually PLAY their instruments. corn don't even have guitar solos, for christ's sake- a five-year-old could play corn's guitar parts."
1,youve got to be kidding me,"""Editorial ReviewsAmazon.comLove 'em or despise 'em, you've got to give Korn props for kick-starting a new metal movement that blends aggressive hip-hop rhythms with roaring hate-metal riffs""Haha no. I don't have to give them props for kick starting a numetal, teen angst movement that blends psuedoaggressive hip-hop rythms with roaring(more like boring) hate(more like angst) metal(more like numetal) riffs(more like crap).What we have here is a bunch of music that all the teenies will think is hard or heavy because they haven't grown up yet and feel they can relate to it because they're parents are so overbearing and their immature brains can't cope with everyday social interaction. Really, if you're over 14 and you still like this music, that's absolutely shameful.This music isn't heavy. It's just catchy, like a bad commercial jingle catchy. The lyrics are pathetic, overly-introverted trite.There's nothing redeeming here."
1,heh...,"Oh my. So much angst! So much emotion! So much... nonsense!Give KoRn (or is it kORN, KorN, or kOrN?) credit though, they know how to create an image and sell themselves, all the while hammering out the same chord over... and over... and over... and over...Hey, let's see you guys keep up the act while riding your BMWs and living in your mansions! Then I'd really be impressed!"
3,It is awesome,I love this album! i love Korn and this is there best cd ever! if you like Korn then this should be the album to get. every Korn album is great but this one is awesome. all the songs are great except my gift to you is a little boring but the extra track at the end is funny. If you don't own this album i suggest you buy it asap.
4,My first korn CD,"hey, I am happy with this CD. The songs are classic korn, I think this is a great band. They are definitely one of the best bands in rock history. Jonathan is a great actor and all of the songs seem to have some sort of actually story line, unlike alot of modern rock. Plus the music itself is great."
4,"really, really good","Everyone keeps talking about how this cd sucks. I love it, it really is a great album. It ahs everything in it...""Got the Life"" has cool disco beats, ""All in the Family"" is a hilarious dis-fest, and ""My gift to You"" has Jonathan playing his bagpipes. ""Pretty"" and ""Seed"" aren't that good, but everything else totally rocks."
1,Talk about wanna be Metal,"Out of all the new ""metal"" out there today, Korn has to be the worst. Whatever happed to good lyrics with great guitar work? You wont find it here. To bad really, hopefully new artists out there will find out heavy and horrible lyrics dont make a good song."
1,okay we s*** but we have taste,Okay we non korn fans s***< but we know more about you about music. Try listening to dream thaetre or kings x that's real music. Try the new jeff beck cd. Although it's not as perfect as a jeff beck release should be it'll blow away anything by korn anyday. By the way the tweleve year old does not know know music if you think korn is great
4,GREAT ROCK CD!!,I love this cd by Korn. It is a GREAT rock cd. However I don't care for the way they use God's name in vain throughout the cd. Personally I would not mind a cleaned version. But other than the bad language its a GREAT rock cd!!
3,An OK addition to the KoRn library.,"Korn has been putting out great sdongs for about five years not. They have, however, benn steadily declining. If you want the best possible KoRn, then go and buy ""KoRn"". The first CD is by far the best. I would venture to say it is one of the best CD's ever."
5,This CD was so addicting!,"I loved ""Freak on a Leash"" and ""Got the Life"", so I decided to buy the CD. I LOVE IT! Oh my God, by the 2nd day, I knew almost all the songs! Those guys rock! The only downer was the 48 seconds of silence at the beginning."
1,I'm still waiting for the next event in rock and roll.,It makes me so sick to think that a talented band (that can write songs that are about things besides how their parents hate them) like Iced Earth has only a cult following when no talent chowderheads like these eat up the charts. In the early 90's Nirvana came along and killed the career of all those idiotic hair bands. As we step into the next decade I await for what will end these jokers careers. Or maybe they'll drown in their pools of angst before that happens. Either way is fine with me.
4,The only words to describe it are...kick ass!!!,"I became a Korn fan with Life is Peachy, and they became one of my favorite bands. Follow the Leader has every kind of music. Speed metal, rap, thrash metal, and lots and LOTS of bass (thanks Fieldy). Jon and Co. have delivered, and are now pioneering a whole new era of metal."
3,Korn's worst and from here it's all downhill>>>,"Unfortunatly this is Korn's last decent cd. After this ""Issues"" came out. That was a depressing day when i bought that cd. Only buy Follow the Leader if you are a die hard korn fan. Otherwise forget it. you're not missing anything."
4,"Forget My Last Reveiw, this CD is awesome!","Upon first hearing of this CD, I thought, ""What's wrong with these guys? They just scream like idiots and make perverted noises with the same roaring tunes and effect noises in the background."" This is one of those CD's that doesn't seem all that good up front. At first I hated it. But because it was so weird, I just had to listen to it again. And agian. And before I knew it, I liked it. The songs on this CD take multiple hearings to thier full potential. I used to hate ""Freak On A Leash"" and ""Dead Bodies Everywhere,"" but now they are some of my favorite songs. And the other songs are pretty good, too, like ""Pretty,"" ""All in the Family,"" and ""Children of the Korn."" I strongly suggest this CD, but if you don't like it at first, don't throw it out until you've listened to it several more times."
3,"Too commercial, if you ask me","Despite all the negative comments said about ""Life Is Peachy"", it might as well be the greatest Korn album. Actually, the first two Korn-albums showed an innovative band. That's how Korn should be. But what do they do next? They release a hyper-commercial album wich features even BIGGER sound and even POPPIER melodies than before. The reason I like ""L.I.P."" is because it's so independent and it isn't constantly trying to please the listeners. In othe words, it is made from the artist's point of vew, while this sounds like a product of a long planning. Planning on how to sell more copies of it. But still, it ain't all bad. There are some goods tracks like ""It's On!"", ""Children Of The Korn"" and ""Freak On THe Leash"". And hey, it's still better than their latest! (Issues: Yuch)"
2,ITS NOT WHAT YOU WOULD EXPECT,"Is it me, or does Follow the Leader sound a lot like their other albums? This is gettin' real old, real fast."
2,Corrupt....,"Korn have, admittedly, released a few good songs, like All In The Family, Got The Life, Blind and ADIDAS, but the fact is that these are songs you quickly tire of. You love them when you first hear them, but then it becomes boring...Korn is also far too commercial! Naming a song of theirs after Adidas, their sponsor, really made me sick. It shows how capitalism and corruption can pervade the music industry, like every other."
3,KoRn disapoints their fans with this one.,"This CD is okay. It is clearly original and different from their previous 2. This is really an attempt to go mainstream to the cost of their diehard fans. They left their hard beat and went with a more fluid CD. This is obviously shown in songs like BBK and the hit Got the Life. The attempt to bring rap (in 3 songs) into their music is pathetic. But I must say ""All in the family"" which is a rap song between Fred Durst of Limp Bizkit and John Davis, is absolutely hilarious. I do like how every song is different however."
4,its ok,its cool if you have a pc cause it has a interview on it.otherwise the remixes sound like rap and r&b there kinda weird
5,"kick a$$ cd, korn ferever","this cd mixes true hardcore beats w/ some hot features like fred durst*limp bizkit* and ice cube. this is one cd u gotta have on ur rack. korn is the best band out, and they'll be here when i'm 40, and thats talent."
5,I love this CD!,"This CD kicks, songs like Got the Life, All in the Family, Freak on a Leash, Dead Bodies Everywhere, and others are great for any Korn fan new or old. Some of the fans of old Korn might not like it, its a different sound, a little less, head banging mosh pit type stuff but its still really cool. Go and buy it, youll like it."
4,Great.........after you listen 5 times,"When I first hear the album I tought: Man, it sucks! But then you get used to their style and it gets amazingly great."
5,KoRn rulez!,"I own all three KoRn cd's and I can't say I like one any more than the others. Everything Korn is good to me. I disagree with all the people who think Korn is selling out. They'll play the music they want to play, it doesn't matter how they were in the past. I think that ""Follow the Leader"" is right up there with everything they've done in the past. If you can't take Korn just because they're mainstream then you definitely aren't a true fan."
5,"If you dont have ""Follow The Leader"" already BUY IT!!!!!",This is the Korn cd to beat all cd's. Their heavy metal/industrial sound makes them one of the best out there. I hope their next cd is as good as this one.
5,THIS CD KICKS A**,if you dont have this cd yet you better because this cd is awesome and korn is the best band in the world and i love the song all in the family
1,YoGuyFagmetal for Jocks,"Here we go again, another band starts a new genre of music and every other band cashes in on them and then that first band sells OUT.Why does everyone Like Korn? cause they Whine?Cause their out of tune?oR because they jump around in stupid purple sports Clothes?he first album wasnt that bad,the second one was a little worse But thIS one got them All mainstream With stupid ice Cube On it And everything.And now thanks to this album,metal is now known as Disharmonized noise,Fred durst has been let loose upon the world and korn went from being pioneers of a ""new"" genre to being just another band football players listen to to get pumped-up before games>"
4,Awesome.,"Fun. Catchy. Angst-y. Korn.Given the choice between Korn and some no-name death metal band, I'll take Korn any day of the week. They integrate a little thing called MELODY into their music, as opposed to ""scary"" grunts and silly lyrics. Davis & Co. know how to construct a groovin' tune, which is why Korn became so popular. Sometimes, the masses DO get it right.I've moved way beyond the 14-year-old obsession of that ""poser"" nonsense years ago. If you have an open mind, give Follow The Leader a shot. Leave discussions on what constitutes as ""REEL MUZIK"" to the kiddies."
1,korn sucks,doesnt sound good at all they play like hard but the lead singer is so gay and can suck my balls
3,Not as rockin',"Follow The Leader was the second Korn album I bought after Life Is Peachy. It is really obvious that Follow The Leader is totally different from Korn and Life Is Peachy. It is also not as good Korn and Life Is Peachy, but it is still very likeable. If you're looking for more of Korn's heavy stuff, go for the first two. My personal favourites from Follow The Leader are Dead Bodies Everywhere, Children of the Korn, and Reclaim My Place."
1,Screw this cd,"I hope all you people are happy. You've now COMPLETELY hyped Korn with your adidas clothing and dreadlocks to the point of no return. Get a mind of your own, you bleating sheep.People such as myself...who bought the debut album WAYYY before the Korn-mania, are now so SICK of korn being played out by you silly little freak shows that hearing ONE note from this album makes me throw up on all my GOOD cds.Thank you. And good night."
1,It's true: Korn has gone soft,"Korn has become the antithesis of what they were on the first album - a teenybopper band. It's a shame to see bands sell out like that. I'm starting to lose faith in all new music lately. What to say about ""Follow The Leader""? Soft, watered down guitar riffs, dumb lyrics and Jonathan Davis' weak voice (more singing and rapping than yelling this time) combine to create an unlistenable mess on par with the Backstreet Boys. Unlike BSB, they do have talent, but obviously they want to make money and play their awful Matchbox 20-style pop, and who's gonna stop them?Anyone who like Korn's self-titled album should stay away from this, as it is a totally different band, completely motivated by money. A candidate for Sellout Of The Year, along with the latest discs from Sugar Ray and Hole. Don't waste your time on this poor excuse for music - pick up the latest album from Sprung Monkey instead, it's awesome."
5,KoRn KoRn KoRn KoRn KoRn KoRn KoRn KoRn KoRn KoRn,Plain and simple : Follow the Leader kicks @$$! Buy It
4,the best we have left in hard metal music,"This cd is for those who are looking for hard @$$ music that feel metallica has gone soft, and are looking for a group they can actually hear on mtv. While not the best ever, the best now, korn's follow the leader is the best recent metal cd on the rack. Musically this cd is five stars, lyrically they are funny, but the lead singers voice, as always, is nothing more than a deep voiced scream. In all a dark cd in a time where the whole world has gone wimpy."
3,Don't buy it,"Don't buy this album. They rip off their own songs, it's a shame. Korn used to be unique until their sound stayed exactly the same for years on end. Take it from someone who bought the 1st album in 1994, 98-99. I actually predicted MTV would pick up their asses. Now they're either too untalented or afraid to progress musically. Listen instead to the real rock album of the year-""Tuonela"" by Amorphis. Korn can't touch these guys. Such is truly the reason certain great acts do not enter mainstream-the music is so good it'll make you feel like you've been decieved by MTV, radio and big business."
2,"New Album, but what's New?","Having totally loved the first two Korn albums I bought this one as soon as it came out. I was a little disappointed, after hearing track after track of the same thing. Each track sounded like a continuation of the last. I really like the first CDs but I found this one lacking. Nothing new was covered, come on guys get a little more imaginative, we are supposed to be creating something NEW here, I already own the first albums. Looks like a band that found something that worked and now is going to run it into the ground."
4,Pretty Cool,"Korn is cool. This CD is their second best, with Korn being the best. The music rocks, and some of the lyrics are funny. John Davis RULES, and his song with Fred Durst, ""All in the Family,"" is really good.I don't think that people should not like this because it isn't metal. It may not be metal, but it is still cool. Kind of like Coal Chamber (they have no talent but sound AWESOME!). This is a great CD to get for anyone who likes loud guitar with screaming lyrics."
1,Worthless sellout crap.,"When Korn entered the scene in, they seemed poised to become the next Nirvana. (I don't mean sounding like Nirvana, I mean a rockin' alternative band that came from nowhere.) Their self-titled album was one of the greatest works of all time, up there with Paranoid, Master of Puppets and In Utero. But what's this crap? Korn sold out more completely and totally than any band has ever before, with the possible exception of Metallica. Only in 'My Gift to You' do we see a glimmer of the old days.This is music for poseurs, by poseurs. Avoid it at all costs."
4,What's bad about it?,"With what people have been saying about this CD I don't understand. Korn have unleashed a sound unique to only a handfull of bands. Along with Rage Against The Machine they have brought this to a larger audiance. ""Follow The Leader"" has an intense experimental sound, with Ice Cube, and Limp Bizkit mixing out some top sounds. If you don't like these artisits helping out Korn, then maybe you should look at what they are all about!!"
3,Rap???? WHY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!??????????????????,"Ok First thing I love the band Korn and they rock but........ why did they let the stupid idiot Fred ""dumass"" Durst do one of their songs with them? Jeez Korn you guys really need to stop the crappy rap stuff and do what you truely want to do....... unless you want to do rap.... then you guys suck! All of the songs were great except for the ones with rap!"
1,"If you are looking for overrated stuff, buy this","Months ago, I read in a british mag that Korn and Limp Bizkit were extremely popular some years ago because a lot of their fans used to be kids with lots of free time to telephone radio stations and request their hit songs of the week and with enough money to ask their parents to buy 'em CDs online.I can't fully agree with the publication, but I just cannot disagree either. A bit of truth must be there. I just find incredible that lots of people call Korn ""Alternative Metal""(LOL). Don't but this cheap stuff, go and take a listen to Dream Theater, Pain Of Salvation, Liquid Tension, Spockbeard and then tell me if you still think Korn is Alternative... Maybe you are right if you mispell the word and call them ALIENATIVE, BORING MUSIC...Your ears deserve something better... trust me."
1,Just plain terrible,"""Look, you guys! I bought this new album called Freak on a Leash, I mean Follow the Leader! Does it go with my Tommy Hilfiger jeans?""Only for worthless preps who think it'll make them cool. Korn's self-titled album was an jawdroppingly good disc, but this is just trash. It's not metal, it's not funk, it's not powerful, it's not intelligent. Just because they whine about being treated unfairly, it doesn't mean it's not trendy bubblegum pop.Get a life, you sheep."
2,Unhappy,"What is the state of affairs among teenagers nowadays (he said, sounding like a cranky old...) when a band that seems so cynical and negative becomes popular? Are we so disaffected, our world view so dark? Will this help anything? I weep for our generation."
1,it didnt work ....,"im sorry but im really disappointed,i have waited cause i was excited to listen to one of my favorite band.aand when i receive it... played it on my car stereo it didnt work...then i thought maybe my car stereo is broken tried it with different stereo and it still didnt work..so im totally bumb out"
4,"Korn's ""Follow the Leader"" follows no one",I LOVE this CD! The guitar and bass work is awesome and the lyrics are stunning. The drums are some of the most original I have heard in a long time. I definitely recommend this product to any true metalhead.
1,is this some kind of joke?,"Korn were only decent from the start, but this album hits a low few bands have ever reached. There are only three good songs: 1) Got the life, which is fast, spooky, and melodic, 2) Dead Bodies Everywhere (ditto), and 3) Children of the Korn (ditto again). But the remaining ten tracks are pure filth! Often drudgingly slow, they also have no melody, annoying ""singing"" or ""rapping"", lackluster riffs, practically no percussion, and the ""dum da dee da"" growls are just nauseating. And on top of it all, there are 25 tracks on here, and the first twelve are blank! What a mockery! If you must listen to Korn, try their s/t, which is much better. And in the realm of nu-metal in general, I suggest Stereomud, Drowning Pool, the Deftones, and Coal Chamber, all of whom are much more talented than Korn."
5,AWESOME!!!!!,"This cd was so awesome!! The lyrics are great. My favorites are ""Got the life"", ""Dead bodies everywhere"", and ""All in the family"". They are so great. If you get one cd this summer, get this one and Limp Bizkits' new one."
2,korn....not a hardcore band,"korn is not a hardcore band. they are a bunch of silly kids trying to be rock stars. korn is goofy, too bad they don't use their talent to make some quality music."
1,Does anyone who liked this book watch Star Trek TNG?,"I can't begin to tell you how shocked I was at the reviews for this book. Not only does the author have trouble representing the characters truthfully (I mean he only has seven years of TV episodes and four movies to study), but the writing was horrendous, just like every other book I've read by this author.But overall, I was most disappointed with the characterizations. I didn't see the crew I love, which was what I was hoping for. If you want to see a Star Trek crew back in action where the books read so clearly that you can actually see the story as if it were an episode, go get the DS9 relaunch.I pray that the other authors in this series show me the TNG crew, because this author couldn't find them.Oh, one last thing: It is not 'witty' or 'inventive' to rehash dialogue directly from episodes or movies."
3,Somewhat Better than Vornholt's previous novel,"John Vornholt's ""A Time to Die"" works better as a work of Star Trek fiction than his earlier ""A Time to be Born"", since he does a better job fleshing out characters. However, this novel is still replete with serious plot errors and oversights, most notably in its depiction of Wesley Crusher's love affair with Star Fleet Counselor Colleen Cabot. Why they fall for each other is simply glossed over, and Wesley's coming to grips with her tragic demise could have been written in such a way to show some growth in his character. Still, to Vornholt's credit, he has written a somewhat better installment in this series."
4,Dog hates the taste of these,"My dog has to be forced to swallow these pills, but they do seem to help with her joint pain."
4,interpretation,It's Amy Jeans birthday tomorrow and her brother Billy wants to buy her a present. She wants a straw hat with roses and bluebells and ribbons on it. The story describes her brothers journey as they venture off in search of the birthday hat Amy wants. Along the way you will learn about the many mishaps that happen along the way. The book has green and black illustrations on every page. An adventure story with a happy ending.
2,Not for me.,I tried this product and found it just didn't work for me. I hated the texture and the taste. Just couldn't get used to it enough to finish the bottle.
3,liquid chlorophyll,I purchessed this on a recommendation from the rescue I adopted my dog from to add to her water to help with her bad breath. Dog liked it and drank it readily but it did not help her bad breath and stained my floor where she splashed it after drinking it. May work well for humans but not so good for my dog's bad breath. Price was good and shipping was quick.
1,Not worthy to buy it.,Simply a number of boring strip shows. Giving one star is because there is not an option of zero.
1,"problems, twice","This is two products in one, which sounds good for $50. (1) It's a discman. (2) It's a car cassette-to-CD converter. That's great if it works as both products.But for me, it hasn't worked. On the first one I got, the volume control didn't work, so it was no good as product (1): discman. On the second one, the volume control works, but it sounds horrible in the car on anything that has electric guitar on it (ie most of what I listen to). So this second one fails as product (2).At the time of writing this review, I'm not sure whether or not I will again send back an unsatisfactory product to Amazon. I suspect that the discman part of it is fine, and that a decent car cassette-to-CD conversion thingy would set things right.But as far as quality goes, I have to score this product as an unacceptable zero for two. It gets one star on the dubious basis of ""What can you expect for $50."""
2,Koss Products only last 1 year,"I have purchased 2 Koss cd players, and one stereo. Koss products do not last. They are not durable, and will skip if you sneeze hard. My advice is stick with the trusted and true brands. Remember: There is a reason why Koss is so cheap!"
4,A Great Basic Player,"I bought this player to use at work, and I love it. It works really well and hasn't broken or anything yet. I only use it with the AC adapter so I'm not sure about it's battery life, and I don't use it in the car or anything so I'm not sure about skippage. However, it is a good model and I have been very satisfied with it. If you just want a basic player for not too much cash, and don't care about all the bells and whistles, go for it."
4,I love it,"I got this one as a gift. My what a Gift! First of all, I don't know why some other reviewers hate its look, I really think it looks very modern and chique! It is also very slim measuring around 1"" in thickness.The fifth star was taken of because it does not have a belt-clip ;-(Until now, it never skipped, not even once. I also like that the PLAY button is kinda hard to push, this is to prevent accidental operation and protect battery. Sound is excellent. A good deal for 50 bucks!"
1,Not enough of a CD player for the money,it does skip a bunch which makes it difficult to listen to when not stationary
4,Good for the amout spent,"This is a good cd player...I only spent 55$ including shipping...It works great, and it doesn't skip much...It is a very good cd player and it is worth more than I payed..."
4,It works Well,I have basically the same model as described except for mine only has 10 seconds of anti-skip I think it is great it works well has good sound quality for the price. I do have to agree that there needs to be some small improvements on the design like a hold button to prevent unwanted battery drain maybe a power saver feature that gives you more battery life and maybe a window to view the cd as it is playing. All in all though I think koss has built a great product even though there are some minor flaws with the design. I was wondering does anybody know if the anti-skip feature is supposed come on when the player is turned on I ask because it does on mine and I just wanted to know if this is normal or not.
1,Koss1689-Limited Value-Limited Warranty-Limited satisfaction,"I bought a KOSS-1689,for about 55.00... Skips very easily,anti-skip eats batteries. Sounds Great! When it works.. Also-any Cd's that you make yourself--- will not play them!////Guess what? 12 month warranty./// Mine just ""died"" after 12 months and 1 week.. Anybody from KOSS care to respond? And, no there is no extended warranty on this kind of player.Plus an extended warranty costs too much anyway.I will be purchasing a Memorex to replace this one."
1,Didn't last long,"This CD player lasted about 3 weeks before the anti-skip feature broke. When engaged, the player now inserts random horrific screaming static. I have relegated the player to a shelf in my workroom where it works fine (as long as you don't turn on anti-skip)!"
1,cheaply made,"doesn't skip after the first few seconds, but be careful, mine broke after a few weeks.... and i didn't do anything out of the norm to it"
1,broken in less than a day,"This cd player is ok...but the case breaks very easily...A tiny little basketball hit it and the case broke. but it still plays...I guess I will have to fix it some how...I suggest you invest 20 more dollars in a sony cd player, those thing last longer...KOSS should stick to making head phones..."
3,"Good for casual use, good value, some audio defects","Nice phones, car cassette adapter works great, anti-skip works well, good for the price. Not tops for critical listening, because there there is continuous audible electronic background schmutz in the phones."
5,it flows through your soul...,"this woman is extroidinary! there has rarely been a classical soloist that becomes the music like jennifer stinton.unlike pianist martha argerich who steals the crayons to brilliantly draw outside the lines, ms.stinton brilliantly guides the orchestra,like a current of air allowing a bird to fly. her subtlety is her strength, and her fluidity is her magic. listen to this beautifully gifted lady, and fly for yourself."
4,"Lord of the Rings, Fellowship of the Ring",I totally agree with the previous review written by E. A. Solinas.This is an excellent reference and background book for the LOL Fellowship of the Ring movie.
5,Pencils,WE order some special pencils for our grandchildren to help them in their beginning writing. These pencil were just what we needed and they came right on time. Everyone is happy.
1,Stopped working after 1 day,"My D-340R stopped working after one day. The ""condition indicator LED"" started blinking and never stopped (the camera won't work when it's blinking) (No, the problem wasn't with the battery or smartmedia card.) Olympus online tech help is worthless - automated response only. When I called their tech support, I was told to return it to the retailer. This is a COMMON problem and is a main reason the price of this camera is falling. Luckily Amazon.com was very helpful in getting my money back."
1,kinda mad in monterey,"The technical data states that this camera is compatible with mac os 7.1 or later. My I mac uses the os 8.1 so, being the idiot that I am, I assumed that this camera would be compatible with my I mac. GUESS AGAIN! The only place in the entire world where you will find the phrase ""this camera will not work with I mac"" is inside of the installation manual that comes with the camera that you just shelled out 300 bucks for ."
5,Cheap digital camera - Extra money for batteries,"I've had the d-340R for a while and I think it is one great camera. The high resolution pictures come out great everytime. The LCD viewfinder means a perfect picture everytime. Battery life isn't great but who cares. Spend some extra money on batteries, it's worth it"
5,I love this camera!,"I have only had mine a day and so far I am very impressed with this camera for what it is. It is not an expensive, loaded camera with lots of bells and whistles. It is a user friendly camera with just enough features to make it advanced enough for anyone from a beginner to intermediate digital camera user completely happy! I wish that it had come with the AC adapter, that is my only negative comment. The software it comes with is easy to install and understand, transferring pictures from the camera to the PC is a snap. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking to buy a digital camera for general use."
4,"simple, good color, fast","I read all of the reviews, and then bought the 340R. Works great. Before the 340R, I would scan photos, and then have to color correct, but with the 340R, the colors look natural right from the camera. The hi-res photos are fantastic -- now I need to buy a printer."
5,Great camera - especially for the price,"I've had my D-340R for about a year and a half and I love it. It has alot of great features, is easy to use and makes great pictures. In my opinion, Olympus has the best digital cameras handsdown.I've seen a couple of reviews saying the D-340R was slow in downloading to the computer - I think that must depend on your computer since I've had no problem with this. As far as draining batteries - it is a wise investment to purchase a battery charger and a couple of sets of rechargeable batteries. They last alot longer and can be purchased for about ... for the charger and ... per 4 pack of batteries (I got mine at Target). I think both the download speed and battery usage are universal with ALL digital cameras.My next digital camera will definately be an Olympus."
4,Love at first Sight,"Believe it or not, I ordered this camera on the Web by ""accident"", but now that I've used it, you couldn't pry it out of my fingers with a crow bar. I somehow clicked on ""purchase"" on a web sight that will go unnamed because three days later a federal express box arrived at my house. Although I was disturbed at first that I had somehow ordered something without intending to, I am not sending this camera back. No way! It is deceptively simple looking, but this masks a ton of features. The pictures are superb and very easy to upload to a PC and send as E-Mail. I haven't had it long enough to run into a battery problem,but the reviews here clearly see that as a problem. I suspect I will buy the battery recharger someday soon.Join the digital age. Buy this camera. You will not be disappointed."
2,Good Camera/ Bad customer service,"Last summer I bought a camera D-340 Olympus and I am truly satisfied with it and I agree with most of the reviews. The problem was when I tried to find service due to an strange condition; the smart media is OK, Batteries are OK. but there is an error condition the led keeps flashing, the manual is not helpful because did not give a way to solve it, I have been triying to find an answer in order to fix the problem an in three month nobody from Olympus service help me to fix the problem or gave an appropiate advise. I am in south america Caracas Venezuela and there is no place to service the Camera. So if you are out of USA and thinkink in buying Olympus be aware that there is no service and there is no answer from Olympus Service Department.Thanks"
4,Good Solid DigCam for the $$$,"I purchased this about 1yr ago and use it a ton. Have since purchased a lot of other Olympus products to go with it that are not as helpful (printer, etc.) so overspent in the wrong place. I strongly recommend getting the Olympus 200-547 16MB Smart Media for Digital Camera PCMCIA Card (Amazon's price on it is better than good - I paid over $100) because it makes the taking and viewing seemless with your computer - if you can accept PC Cards, most can. The Smart Media card allows you to instantly view images, send via email, post to image hosting sites for auctions, etc. without using Olympus' rather lousy, but usable, Camedia Software. All round its the best choice for the mid-market digcam - I'm happy and expect you will be too."
5,The best way to make digital photography at low cost,"This camera is to me an excellent option to enter the digital photography universe. Their great quality images, the multiple options to review the pictures taken and the easy way to operate their multiple optiones, make this camera the best."

1,Laughable work of fiction,"It is nothing like Clancy. If the author had done even a little bit of research, he would've learned that the Pakistan Air Force follows British ranks -- so ""Major"" Khan should have been Squadron Leader Khan, and a Lieutenant Colonel, Wing Commander. The book is riddled with such factual errors and childish plot twists. Not to mention anything of the amateurish dialog between the protagonists!"
5,Reads Like Tomorrow's Headlines,"This is a flatout good read - It kept me turning the pages well into the wee hours. Full of action and intrigue it will carry you along as terrorists penetrate the Homeland to begin carrying out a very plausable and troubling attack. However, it doesn't end there. If you like Tom Clancy, Dale Brown, or Richard Hermanyou will enjoy the adventure that James Huston has laid out for you. Buckle up!"
3,"A good read, but could have been better","I enjoyed the book for the most part, although I was left wanting more at the end. I kept waiting for there to be more to the plot. The opening sequence didn't seem to fit with the rest of the book, Vlad's story was incomplete or too glibly finished, and the setup for the climax (the two attacks) seemed rushed as did the climax itself (or should I say anti-climax). I wanted more about the school and the training, more development of some of the secondary characters like Thud and the UFO fellow or Thud's dad. In short, there was lots of potential, but a lot of it was left on the table."
3,Sadly Disappointing,"Much to my chagrin, Fallout is a step down for Huston. His prevoius novel, Flash Point reeked with authenticity that this novel lacked. Being a former F-14 pilot, he knew a lot about the US Navy and its fignter squadrons. In this novel, he deals with material that he is not comfortable with. He writes of MiG-29's and the Pakastani Air Force and thus is not a fleshed out with detail. On top of that, the characters are not well developed, and nor is the plot. It does not have the depth and breadth of his previous novel, which also contains a love story that this novel lacks. Huston should stay with what he is comfortable with and write more about Naval Avation, possibly even with a sequel to Flash Point, with the same main characters. If you want to read great avation fiction, read Flash Point or a Stephen Coonts novel. Avoid this skeleton of a novel."
3,"Enjoy, but don't be too picky!","An entertaining book as long as the reader is not too picky about factual information. Some parts of the plot are underdeveloped.......foreign military protocal, business plan implementations...'exec's cannot be too busy'. Not Huston's best work."
1,"What is ""Maximum Strength""?",nowhere on this page can I find where it says how much glucosamine or chondroitin is in the tablets. How do you know if this is a fair price without the dosage?
1,What junk is being sold here,"Why can't we rate a product with no value as 0 stars? To quote from the manufacturer's own description:""Note: this product has not been evaluated by the FDA"""
4,Help! I'm in love with a Narcissist,Also a good book to help you identify this personality. Not written by a physcologist but from someone who's been there.
4,Really helped,"This book has really helped me to understand why I was drawn into a relationship with an NP. It's a very easy read, full of useful examples. It goes in-depth on being raised in a narcissistic environment, which I never realized I had been until reading more on the subject for dealing with a current relationship. So, it helped in that respect. The only reason I can't give it a full 5 stars is because it didn't really address the other extreme cause of NPD, which is over-indulgent parents. While my narcissistic parent became so from neglect and abuse, my partner had the opposite upbringing and I feel it's just as important to understand that side of NPD as well."
5,best book on narcissism ever!!,"I want to thank the authors so much for writing this book!! In the last 3 months of trying to get away from my narcissistic lover I have read probably 12 books on the subject including all of Sam V's stuff. It was helpful. But this book totally sums it up and I was laughing, finally, at what I went thru. Especially the part about how they can seem so needy and insecure that you want to protect them! Nobody seems to be covering that. This is a very sensible, straight-forward, honest look at what these folks are really like. If you are caught in a painful, messy, unsatisfying relationship, do yourself a huge favor and buy this book."
5,The best of its kind.,"I've read every book there is on narcissism, and this is the best. It captured my experience to a ""t"" and offered the most comprehensive and detailed information (without being clinical or boring) on all facets of the disorder. It was such a relief to have a name (and description) for the incredible insanity I lived through with my narcissistic partner. I especially loved the story about the man who lovingly made a sandwich for his girlfriend at a party. Anyone who's been involved with a narcissist can relate to the twisted truth of what actually happened when the story unfolded. Fascinating stuff and a real lifesaver. If you want to understand how you got involved with this type of person -- and how to avoid it in the future -- this is the book for you."
4,Brilliant advice,"I've enjoyed being with Peter Schutz on two different occasions and been mesmerized and inspired by his ability to convey critical management truths with compelling stories. This book is ""Good to Great"" for the non-analytical crowd. It's a great idea to read both, but Schutz is the one I'll be quoting.Unfortunately Peter is a better story teller than editor, and the book version tends to ""go all over the place."" The insertion of a series of glowing testimonials, originally collected for book jacket endorsements, have been inserted instead between chapters. There inclusion suggests a man of towering ego, rather than the self deprecating, funny and completely human man I met in person. Regardless, unless you have an opportunity to spend some time with Peter face to face, I heartily endorse the book as a reasonable second choice."
2,Early 1980's video,"This is a 25 - 30 year old video. There is no copyright date on this video labeled Modern Combat Aircraft 4, but it refers to the Falkland War 1982 (for the Harrier).It covers the early 1980 naval aircraft from US, Britain and France. The latest planes were the Tomcat, Hornet and Harrier. There is no combat footage."
4,"Good book, good price",The first 30% of this book was all about the history but that does not matter because it was still a good book but a little outdated. Also some of the pictures were not where they were supposed to be.
4,BROADENING HORIZONS,"VERY INFORMATIVE IF YOU WANT TO LEARN ABOUT GARDENING IN GENERAL, OR IF YOU WANT TO ADVENTURE OFF AND GROW THESE BIG MAMA'S"
4,Engaging for even younger kids,My five year old was captivated from the opening words. Will be glad to have this one in the car for long trips on the way to visit relatives. Seller was very timely.
1,poor workmanship,"Winch was rated for 2000 lbs. After installation, on first usage for a 1600 lb boat, the handle (crank) stripped and left me with a half cranked boat. Winch should have been rated for a 1000 lb or less load considering the materials used."
3,"As far as I can tell, it's a good product","This is one of those products that are difficult to evaluate... However, I believe it helped me and is good product!"
5,A delightful upper,"This CD is a delight. Including some well-known gems by Jolin and Gershwin, the disc also offers some lesser known corners of the ragtime canon, including two selections by modern rag composer (and winner of the 1997 Scott Joplin prize for the best new rag), Brian Dykstra. The selections are brilliantly played by Lester and the sound is excellent. A winner all around."
3,Good collection if looked at the right way,"Interested in being published, I picked this up as a survey of what publications are buying these days. Looked at in that light, this was a ""helpful"" book; I am, however, inclined to agree with the previous reviewers in saying I was not overwhelmingly pleased by the stories. ""Elvis has left the building"" was definately a favorite, though. Still, if you like short stories, give this one a whirl."
2,keillor finds a way to weed out the best,"I suppose the idea of asking Keillor to be the judge this year was to increase circulation by posting a ""brand name for the masses"" on the book's cover. But too often this book reads like much of Keillor's own overdone work. Adjectives are forced on us, descriptions are included for the sake of descriptions. The editor seems to have no real tolerance for variety. Can one not include ""The Knife Thrower"" and still be considered a worthy judge of great literature? Of course many stories in this collection are good, a few great (e.g., Lorrie Moore's story), but many ramble on, seem too much like life as we know it on boring days. I doubt if Nature cares one way or another about literature. But art need not imitate life, as Keillor's choices seem to suggest. Keep the best 120 list, but be careful who whittles the list down to 20."
3,Animal Talk cards.,These cards are not for a specific game but you can make up your own if you choose. The convenience of being able to lose cards without spoiling the game is handy for little kids.(Big kids too).It's OK for a quiet game of identification but not very exciting.
2,Plasmaquarium review,Not as high quality as other DVD's I have seen. Careful fish look computer generated wanted to have a flat screen in game room with this on it but looks too fake when compared to other DVD's
4,"One caveat, the ""natural sounds"" are terrible","The DVD gives you 3 options at the beginning, one with relaxing music, one with natural sounds, and a loop of scene 1. The natural sounds are supposed to resemble the bubbling of a fish tank, but they sound fake and are horrible. The relaxing music is great, so plan on either listening to that or muting the TV."
3,Fish are a little too far away still,"GOOD:You can tell its not a fishtankCool reef'sgood sound qualityvery clearBAD:fish are still too far away and scarce, kind of like original Plasmaquarium.natural sounds are not natural but computer generatedone of the scenes is ONLY coral, there are no fish, LOLWISH LIST:more fishcloser to the fish-NOT LITTLE TINY FISH FAR AWAYactual natural marine sounds from actual underwater or better computer generated onesmore options for music as after the 2nd time you watch you are bored with the music.option for silencewhen in loop mode, fix the transition on the loop, it just stops all of a sudden and starts again"
3,good but could be better,"nice video and sound and it comes with options(loop,aquariam sounds and or music)but it seems to have gliches as if it was a screensaver on a computer(on my computer and my dvd player and bluray)as if your computer has a lot on its cpu;but i still enjoy it."
2,missig imagiation,"We were looking for a DVD of Tropical ocean fishand colorful reef coralHoping to enjoy it while meditating. This DVD was very dissapointing,Few fish and dead coral,We ordered one that was not an aquarium and are very happy with it"
1,Wondering why it is published,"Musicians looking for a copy of the famous Concerto No.4 will have to look elsewhere than the Dover Miniature Series if they actually want to read the score and learn the music. The size of the book (8 X 6 inches) makes it little more than a music token and certainly not useable as is for students. I am very disappointed in Dover, who otherwise has a great series of music publications, and can't imagine why they bothered to publish this book. Beethoven would be appalled."
1,my review,i decided to rate this product a one star because it was missing a record so it only had half of the songs it should of.
4,Water in the desert,"I just saw this movie with my 11-year-old son who watched it with rapt attention. I agree it has many parallels to ""Fly Away Home."" But it will be a refreshing break for parents who endure the wasteland of children's movies and wonder what there is out there to engage and inspire our children rather than bludgeoning them with hyped-up animation, improbable superheros, and vulgar comedies. Don't miss it if it ever comes to a theater near you. We need to support movies that have some agenda other than fast-food tie-ins."
5,A great Movie,"This movie was not only entertaining, but like Lassie, involving pets and little boys, was wholesome and just plain good to watch."
5,What an unusual pet...,"We really enjoyed watching this movie as a family. If you have lived or visited Africa is a MUST see movie. It brought us back many fond memories from such a unique place and it will sure be the case for anyone that watches this movie.The cheetah is the most docile of all the wild cats. When I was in Africa (Kenya), while driving in Masai-Mara reserve, a cheetah sat on the front of our car enjoying the warmth of the car engine. If you are planning to see this movie with little kids be prepared for some intense scenes with wild animals.A moment I keep from the movie is when they burn their money to start a fire so to keep away the wild animals. It seems that it takes extreme circumstances like this to set the right priorities..."
5,Love Duma,I read that this movie didn't actually stay faithful to the book it was made after. I have to admit though it is a GREAT family movie. My kids love it!! You can't go wrong with this movie. I recommend it to everyone.
4,Not your ordinary dog and pony show,"A boy and his dog on a road trip meet a dark stranger?In a waste land a boy and his a cheetah meet a black fellowand a bond of friendship is found in the trip north toDuma's home hunting grounds. Lions and crocodiles don't stopthis journey into adulthood, for either the cheetah orthe South African boy. The pictures of the cheetah and the wildlifeare very entertaining."
2,Skip it.,"The opening scene is highly improbable. The closing scene does not make the slightest lick of sense in the context of what's gone before in the story. In between, the title cheetah is little more than a prop and the human characters are completely two-dimensional. I was very disappointed in this film. If this is ""family entertainment"", then we must not expect our families to do much thinking about their entertainment."
1,Duma Review,"This movie appears to be a remake of an earlier movie entitled ""Cheetah"" although with a different cast of characters. Still a good movie."
3,The book is better,"Our family had fallen in love with the book ""How It Was With Dooms"" by Xan Hopcraft on which the movie is based. We were very disappointed to discover that the movie and the book have nothing in common other than they are about a boy named Xan and a cheetah named Duma. There the similarilty ends. The story in the movie is completely changed from the true story in the book. The movie itself is OK, perfect for family viewing, with some beautiful shots of Africa. The movie has none of the charm of the book and has a somewhat predictable ending. It is really too bad as I think that the story from the book would have made a far better movie."
4,Delightful Movie,"This movie truly impressed us. It's a delightful story about a boy and his cheetah, and a man who seems to be the bad guy but is on his on quest. It's a story with a happy ending, and not too many tears; it has adventure and thoughtful moments. The story is beautifully filmed in Africa. We highly recommend it as family entertainment."
5,lovely family movie,"""Duma"" is a beautiful story of a young man finding himself after the loss of his father. The acting is superb, and while the movie is not violent, it is action-packed and even thrilling at times. I thought that the dialogue and thematic content of this movie might be a bit sophisticated for a young audience, but my 5 year old loves it and has watched it many times over. Also a great choice for animal lovers. A rare movie that is truly enjoyable and inspiring for both parents and children alike!"
5,"Duma, A Cheetah's Story","Wonderful story, acting. Highly recommended. Very touching story. It remains with you monthly after viewing. I loved this story of the South Africa cheetah who becomes a family pet."
2,Don't waste your money,"The case is nice.. The tripod's are both too unsteady to handle the wieght of the F828. The 2x lens is useless, poor focus and the field of view is too small. The other lens are ok, but not great. It is not a ""professional"" kit."
2,well illustrated,but the extremely helpful collection of primary and secondary sources gathered in the appendix for the hardcover version is not present in the paperback. be warned.
2,21st Century B42A1 60-piece Gas grill Ceramic Briquette,"We were going to convert our new gas grill to briquettes, like we've had in the past. However, these ceramic briquettes were of an inferior quality and unlike the claim on the bag, did not cover a medium size grill."
2,"Way too expensive, but hard to find","Needed to replace for my old grill and the parts do what's intended, but they are very expensive for what they are."
5,Under rated composer for fantastic piano concerto!!,"Every one a winner! For sheer joy and excitement you have to try this, and his other concertos, must be physically demanding to play, rapture!"
2,Buy a different map,"This map was so cluttered, it was not worth using in Amsterdam.The freebie maps we got at the airport and at the TI in Amsterdam were ten times more useful. Wish I had not bought it."
3,Propoganda style,"This discusses ways to eat during shortages from the war while still meeting dietary needs. I found it to have a subtle propoganda style to it. And on more than 1 occasion, I questioned some ideas (kind of that in case of nuclear attack, duck under your desk kind of thing). But it was an interesting read just for the war time era feel."
3,everyday foods in war time,This book is good but I feel that one could also use a nutrition book to do the same thing and one could create their own information notes. Over all the book is informative. And would fit well in ones library.
2,Poor Compared Within the Genre,"I am very interested in vintage and war-time home/cooking books and have read numrrous books within this genre. Unfortunately, I did not find this one to be informative as it mostly preached about milk and did not have practical infofmation. This may be a good book for someone who has not looked into nutrition or extreme frugality before."
1,Was not what i ordered.,I got the package and the controller wasnt even what I was ordering. I thought the product was the one that was shown and it wasnt. I was very displeased but before i could send it back for my refund... my pet ate it.
5,Great Solution,"I love it! I'm using it to backup camera cards to CD. You don't have to plug it in, does fine on battery power. Shove the card in a slot, blank CD in the drive, 3 button pushes and you're done. I also love the way it can put multiple cards and multiple sessions on on CDR. You can go back to a previous CD and put more stuff on it.I'm getting a card reader for my laptop and a high capacity card or two so I can write PC file backups to the card, then use the Kanguru to burn to CD, because it's far less hassle and more idiot proof than any CD writer I've had.What I haven't tried yet: using the Kanguru DVD player, or hooking it up to a PC to use as card reader or CD drive.But for the purpose I got it, storing camera files, it's wonderful."
4,Sounds good,I met the author at my school today and he talked about his books.He's really funny and my classmates that have read the book ( about 2/3 of them) really liked it. He's talked about this specific book a lot. And I really enjoyed it. I'm definatly going to get the book this year.
2,Wrong Volume,"Beware! This is not volume VI of the series, as you may think from the illustration. Rather it is the fairly useless and obsolete 1st volume of the 1928 printing of the Old Edition. Noe of the links work, and it has been poorly transcribed."
4,BLUE'S A DANCING FOOL AND LOVES THE ABCs,"2 1/2 Loves blue! She(blue) dances like(two hand functions)crazy,tail wags and says the ABCs,also makes some animal sounds.It's cheaper here,$19.99.Other places want $29 and up,plus shipping! Shipping was FREE and it only was $1.55 tax in Cal,. Same size as His Elmo."
2,Promising BUT Disappointing,"The toy boasts that Blue does the Conga and dances...but it falls down! It's not nearly as stable as the Elmo dolls; the songs are great but if the dancing doesn't work, I'd rather buy a CD to hear the songs vs. spending the money on a doll that doesn't function.A waste of money, unfortunately."
4,I got it for my shoulders,I know this thing was for something else ..lol ..but it is feel good on your sore muscles and I got it for my shoulders and neck...it is easy to hold for that and worked good ..I keep forgetting I have it ...good price and well made
2,not very strong,"Weak performance, only benefit is that it is quiet but that is about all it is, I would not buy again."
3,Ouch,Bought this product recently to enhance my pleasure and it is painful and irritating. After ten minutes it felt like I was sitting on a stun gun. I expected much more out of the product and it turned out to be a pain.
1,Bad experience,"It was not noiseless as the site claimed. Instead, the noise from the motor is very loud during the quite night. It started not to work just after the 90-day warranty expires. The ""90-day warranty"" was confirmed from several depressing calls I made to amazon and the manufacturer in a way of back and forth. The answers from them are ""why do not you get a new one""? If you are wise, you will not do that."

3,"MIXED REVIEW, GEORGE DUKE LITE","I HAVE BEEN LISTENING TO THE MUSIC OF GEORGE DUKE SINCE THE EARLY 1970'S WHEN HE PLAYED WITH FRANK ZAPPA. I HAVE ALL HIS OLD RECORDINGS, GOING BACK TO HIS STUFF WITH JEAN LUC PONTY, AND CANNONBALL ADDERLY, PRE-MOTHERS OF INVENTION. I BOUGHT THIS CD A LONG TIME AGO AND LISTENED TO IT A FEW TIMES. IT WAS OKAY, BUT NOT ONE OF HIS BEST. I HAVE LISTENED TO IT A FEW TIMES MORE SINCE THEN, AND IT IS A VERY UNEVEN MIX OF MUSIC,. SOME OF IT IS GREAT, AND OTHER PARTS ARE DISAPPOINTING, KNOWING WHAT THE MAN IS CAPABLE OF DOING AND THE MUSICIANS HE HAD TO WORK WITH. SOME OF THE SONGS SOUND AS IF THEY WOULD BE PLAYED ON ONE OF THOSE ""SMOOTH JAZZ"" STATIONS ON THE RADIO. BUT WHEN IT WORKS, IT IS REAL GOOD. ANYWAY, IT IS SOMETHING DIFFERENT, BUT BY NOE MEANS ANYWHERE NEAR THE BEST MUSIC THE MAN HAS RECORDED."
4,Brings it all back (Feel the Noize!),"A good compilation of (some of) Slade's singles. Slade were a great band based on the fundamental notions of energy, noise, excitement and fun, and it comes through in many of the tracks, particularly the mid-1970s material. Interestingly, the lyrics are able to sketch out a story with very few words (e.g. ""G'buy T' Jane""), which beats a lot of rap today.Only 4 stars because there's only an hour of music on the CD, so 20 minutes is left blank. There was certainly other excellent music that could have been included, not necessarily singles. Sometimes really good tracks are on the albums, yet still get airplay and should go on a compilation (Queen's ""Tie Your Mother Down"" being but one example). Perhaps it's cut back for the US market (alas).If you enjoy Rock 'n' Roll with energy and fun, you will probably like this CD a lot."
4,"SLADE, back to the 80's for me....","Great album, it reminds me of the early to mid 1980's when things were going crazy and I was MUCH younger. The album is great and it has all of the tunes that I was looking for on it.... The shipping and handling was also fantastic and I appreciate it...."
4,Emotionally evocative faith-filled stories,"I really liked this book. I knew Dorothy Edererfrom her work at a local parish years past. So when I heard she had written a book , I knew I had to get it. I found the personal stories very moving--I laughed and cried. The chapter lead-in prayers are wonderful, and I have already shared them with friends. The faith the author expresses is an inspiration. I have most of my Christmas shopping done thanks to this book--I have gotten copies for family and friends. A book that made me feel, think, and want to share--what more can you ask for in a book?"
5,Colors of the Spirit is a joy to read.,"It is hard for me to put into words how impressed I am with the writing style of Dorothy Ederer. She has a very special gift of telling stories of experiences in her life and the life of others that have hidden within them profound spiritual truths. I was completely captivated by this book and couldn't put it down. For the past ten years I have confined my reading to spiritual books, books authored by some of the great Christian writers of the past and those of modern times. In my opinion, colors of the Spirit is one of the very best spiritual books I have read in recent years. It's message is simple and at the same time profound. I intend to read it again if I can my wife to part with it. Buy it, you will love it."
1,Back to Basics,"Back to Basics is a Con! How can he know the steps when he does not know the traditions he tells you his name Wally Patton!Why do people have to pay for the Book? If Wally Paton is on a spiritual program then why does he charge for this book when it can be downloaded for free.( He owns the Company that prints it)Where are his 150,000 members and the 2500 groups? (They are not listed in the AA where to find)Why does Wally Quote James Houck who did not come to AA until the late 80's? Why does Wally ask for cash for none AA projects for James Houck? I can only state again that if Wally paton does not know that the Foundation of AA is Anonymity then how can he profess to know the steps!!!There is no rush to do the steps "" take it easy "".Wally P states that AA has lost its message well his message is one of breaking the traditions !!! I think wally had better read the traditions and then get a good sponsor to take him through the steps !!!It is Wally paton that has lost the message not AA."
4,Africas close up,"Stephenson, a 27 year old landscaper from New York, spends 9 months with the Hadzabe tribe south of the Serengeti.. He describes this experience in a very honest way, and so we learn about these hunters in the bush: their dreams, their spirits, their hunting, their daily life and their families. It is a well rounded picture. He loves these gentle people and finds peace and quiet with them. But he admits that he never learned their language and, of course, he always has his return ticket to New York.To call this adventure a retrogression in time towards stone age people would be quite wrong. The Hadzabe are well connected to civilization. They drive by car to the local hospital. They steal radios. They sell their hunting trophies for money, go to the village bar and get stoned on pombe. They wear western clothes and hunt at night with a flashlight. But they prefer their life in the bush, and that is the difference.The book has many pictures and drawings. It is a nice adventure story."
5,delight for armchair travelers,"Surely one of the greatest pleasures of reading is that a book can take us to places where we will never go. James Stephenson has done that, bringing to life in these pages the feel, the taste even the emotions of the Hadzebe. This is not anthropology, it is life as he experienced it. We can be grateful that he has shared the experience."
3,A required textbook,"This book was required for a course I took on modern china. Along with the text ""The Search for Modern China: A Documentary Collection"", this book made really entertaining reading. It explains in a clear and engaging manner the last (almost) 2000 years of Chinese history! Great for sinophiles everywhere."
4,very nice history,"This is a book I enjoyed very much. Spence takes the reader on a fast march through Chinese history from the late Ming period through 1989 (in my first edition). He wastes few words and doesn't dwell at length on any one subject. And he can't afford to, as he has a rich, finely grained story to tell. He writes with confidence and deep familiarity with politics, art, and society. The book seems to be a labor of love, but does not venture into romanticism. It is well organized into sections which make for digestible chunks. The book is written for a general reader of history. I would not have minded if the author had paused more to discuss alternate interpretations of Chinese history or had identified more of his personal opinions of nuances. The reader will have to turn to the extensive reference list for such discussions. All in all, though, this is a very good book which I can recommend highly."
4,Stick to ancient Chinese history,"Like the other reviewers, I love Spence's work in the Ming and Ching dynasties. Books on Kang Xi, Mateo Ricci, Yong Zheng, those were all great books that come alive. Same for this book up to the PRC period, when it really falls down. I think it is the author's bias in favor of the communist movement. Personally, I think the PRC from 1949 to 1989 has been 20% correct and 80% wrong/totally messed up, to use the Chinese anlalogy. Just visit Taiwan or Hong Kong, free Chinese societies, to see the huge difference. Forturnately for Taiwan, Japan, HK and Korea, Mao and his gang of thugs kept the PRC opressed for 40 years, giving free societies such a leg up."
5,This is the one.,"Just examining the China/Far East section at your local bookstore will reveal just what an authority Spence is. In the US he dominates the field and this book is his most comprehensive offering. He does indeed support a very modest bias, as another reviewer has pointed out, but this is far less apparent than in the many many other books that deal with the subject. None of Spence's contemporaries really compare, and none of his other works do either. As an history this is a phenomenal guide, providing rich detail and a cohesive overview. As I have said though - there is a slight bias in his thesis, but in the field of recent Chinese history an unbiased opinion is as rare as a comprehensive view. That is to say, of any book you're likely to find on the subject 'Search' is the most comprehensive and the least slanted."
4,pleasant book,"This was a very good book to get an general view on Chinese history.The writer follows the mainstream view on history. I also read Mao, the untold story. That gives a more revisionist view on history. Very good to compare and it would be good if the writer of this book could incorporate some of these views.Gerrit vd Bergtraveling in china"
5,An Unponderous History,"To truly know China, it is essential to have a grasp of its rich history. But that history is so vast and dense, it is easy to get lost. This book is an admirable guide. For a review of contempory issues, see my own book:The Coming China Wars: Where They Will Be Fought and How They Can Be Won"
1,fluff and b.s.,"hate to breakup the love fest in these pages, all from former students and other young, naive college undergrads, but this book is a joke. Only the uninformed read Spence, and certainly not any Chinese. His histories of pre and eraly modern China lack detail, substance, and any evidence he has kept up with recent scholarship of, say, the last 20 years. And, worse yet, he has little to say about modern/Communist China, except for the same crap you can read in any newspaper/wire service.A much,much better book on China (modern), and one better respected within the profession/education establishment, is/are Maurice Meisner's books and the Mao and Deng eras. He writes lucidly too, and unlike Spence, is capable of sustaining an argument and not lt\etting his own self/ego get in the way."
1,The Search For Modern China?,"For the sake of brevity, I should point out in one stroke that this ""history on China"" is one of the shallowest work on the subject I have ever read. Even if only taking the small sample of books on China here at Amazon.com, one would discover that most works are superior in knowledge and analysis.This book further confirms my earlier suspicions of Spence's fitness to be considered a reputable historian on China. His writings are no better than his lectures at Yale, as they all suffer from the same chronic syndrome of his personal prejudices at the expense of decent history writing. I find no choice but to admit that Spence is a self-styled ""authority"" more than anything else.I notice that certain reviewers on this site give acclaims to Spence solely because his book is easy to read and follow according to them. Maybe that should be a hint, not to the high quality of the book, but to some people's willingness to accept the most naive and simple views on history."
4,Best of class,"This book is a best-seller for one very good reason: it makes modern China interesting for people who might otherwise be appauled by the place. It's the best general introduction to the subjects, is very well written, and good enough to serve as a reference for non-Sinologists.So why the recent spate of negative reviews? Young Sini-cle Yalies just got your poor grades back? Lesser-known China experts jealous of the doyen's popularity with the English-speaking masses? That some reviewers have gone down to one star on a generally respected title should be a hint that there's something amiss, and its not with the book itself."
5,Essential Reading for the Amateur Sinophile,"This is essential reading for both Chinese studies majors and anyone who wants a comprehensive, well-researched history of modern China. The writing is highly readable, moving along at the same pace as some of the better novels out there. This work is chock full of anecdotes, facts, photos, and tables, all serving to support and illuminate the strong narrative core of the book.I've read it again and again. I highly recommend it."
5,Riveting,"I fell in love with China when I was five years old, through the Golden Book Chinese Fairy Tales. What a joy to recapture that love in reading Spence's book.As you know, there are many writers about China, and frankly it should be an axiom that once you go to China, you become Chinese. It MAKES you Chinese. Yet, most of the writers are too -- what's the right word, pedantic? -- so you miss 'being there' as you read. It's impossible to understand Chinese Communism, if you don't understand CHINA.You will 'be there', when you read Spence. Then you will understand."
4,Eloquent book on family and on politics,"I really enjoyed this book. While not the most literary writer, Gordon Smith writes with a directness and simplicity that is very compelling to read. He wrote movingly of his feelings for his family, particularly his son Garrett who passed.I also was interested in his description of the political process in getting a mental health care law passed. He provided a true insider's perspective.I'm taking off one star because I wish he had written more about how his other two children handled Garrett's death. Perhaps he was trying to preserve their privacy, but even a fleeting reference would have been appreciated.I'm not taking off a star for this, but will note that it's also quite a short book. In Kindle terms, it's 1255-whatever-they-are long, while most books that I read are around 5000-whatever-they-are. For the bargain Kindle price, though, I was not at all disappointed, and felt it well worth the money."
3,Doesn't work with Windows 7...,This product would be okay if it worked with Windows 7. I haven't tried it on my XP computer to see if I have better luck there but if I can't play it on my laptop then it's pretty much useless to me. So far I haven't found an update for this product so it would allow me to play it.
5,almost as good as the original,"My brother and I have the original 1960's version of this game. I let him take it to his house to enjoy with his kids so Santa brought this new version to my house. It is a little smaller than the 60's version, but just as much fun!"
1,Not At Alll What Was Pictured,"I was very disappointed. I returned the item. Was not what was pictured or described. Over priced junk, not what I thought I was getting. False advertising."
2,Battling tops.,When they said 'original' battling tops I suspect the only thing that's original is the overall design. When I was a kid (a good ways back now!) the 'crucible/battling ring' was made of heavier plastic as were the tops. This made for much better battling. The game has been cheapened by lightweight products - but the what hasn't these days!?
5,game,This is true to the original version. Your child needs a slight amount of patience because just like the old toy you need to wind the string around the top but it is worth the wait. It can be very fun for both child and parent especially if you had one as a kid and you can tell your child all about how you enjoyed it when you were young.
3,I just dunno,"I dunno. I did buy this game because I remembered it from a Christmas when I was little. And you know, I gotta figure my dexterity has only improved since then. None of us can get the tops going. Maybe it's me, but one of us should have been able to get the things going. It seems cheaply made. Maybe I'm blaming my lack of dexterity on the manufacturing, but it really shouldn't be this tricky.I'm giving it a ""3"" rating to give it the benefit of the doubt."
1,its hideous,"i bought this for my 5 year old son who needs work with manual dexterity. it just frustrated him to no end. i had my 11 year old try it and he couldn't get it to work, and neither could i. i'm sure some people might like it but if you like tops spinning i wouldn't suggest it at all."
2,Not for kids with autism or motor problems,"I bought this for my son who has autism after he had seen a similar game played on Model Me Kids ""Time for a Playdate"" dvd. Unfortunately, because of his difficulty winding the string, this game was more than a disappointment for us. I also tried and failed more than half the time to get them spinning. I went looking for wind-up tops to use on the stage area that works much better (at a dollar a piece, they saved the day!) If your child has any kind of motor planning problem, fine motor difficulty, or is under 9 years old, I wouldn't waste the money on this one."
2,A far cry from the original,"I think the guy who said any adult with motor skills and five minutes of patience should have no problem making the tops spin, is remembering the ease of spinning the tops on the original game when we were kids. I guess my motor skills are at least average, and as a fisherman, I have loads of patience, but, I don't think I could get one of these tops, in the new version of this game, to spin if my very life depended on it! Maybe it's just me? I was really looking forward to playing this game with my daughter, but I think it would just frustrate her the same way it has her old man. I had no problem spinning the tops as a kid in the 70's, maybe my motor skills have eroded, I don't know. I would not recommend the new version of this game to anyone."
5,Excellent Bible Study Source,"I purchased this book for my daughter as it is easy to read and understand, having alternative suggestions for the meanings of some of the words. I have had the same book for 30 years and love it. She wanted mine so I bought her one just like it."
1,Faux Celebrity Architecture,"This is another made for architectural event. The book is too big, the photographs too many, and the level of talent too small. Another grouping of architects who will be forgotten 12 months from now.The critics, selections and the poor knock off of SMLXL are all contrived. Save your money."
4,An original voice answering to his own muse,"I'm so late to the party that there is really little I can add to the other great reviews here. So, let me just note that I cannot seem to keep ""The Historical Conquests of Josh Ritter"" out of my CD player for more than a couple of days before I need another fix.He draws upon many literary and cultural touchstones but fashions the themes, tone, and imagery into lively, lyrical poetry that meshes just right with the music. And what great music, full of unexpected touches and flourishes flights of fancy that take the solid performances to another level.I'm not sure I get all the comparisons of Mr. Ritter to other folks, however. He is an original voice answering to his own muse. Now if I could just get the snippet ""wait for love, wait for love"" out of my head and return to my regularly scheduled tasks at hand."
3,Preview this one first !,"I love Josh Ritter. The Animal Years and Hello Starling are fantastic, and I liked the earlier cds a great deal as well. I love his live performance, both the one I attended and the ones I've listened to recordings of. So I ordered this one with no hesitation at all, only to be very disappointed. There are some good songs, but compared to previous albums (where there isn't a single song I don't like), this one is pretty much hit-or-miss. I get the feeling maybe there was a lot of experimentation going on. I hope so, because then I can hope that the next cd will go back to the Josh Ritter I love."
1,It's all downhill on these tracks,"This album contains none of the intimate and enchanting tunes that gave Josh Ritter a devoted following, tunes like ""Me and Jiggs"" and ""Harrisburg"" in Golden Age of Radio. All of the songs I heard are completely unmemorable and the best ones remind me of the worst of Gilbert O'Sullivan. To make things still worse, the recording quality of this CD is simply terrible, it is so highly compressed. I can only guess that poor Josh must be going through some creative crisis and this was his record company's doing to capitalize on his past and well deserved success. I hope this album is just an aberration and that Josh gets back to his former self soon."
5,Josh Ritter...Still Beating!,"No one said it would be easy to live up to the hype of Animal Years, but I think Josh Ritter has done it! Historical Conquests shows the continued maturation of Josh Ritter. The new album is different than earlier albums, but definitely not worse. On display are different musical styles and creative lyrics. My favorite part of the album is that no two songs sound alike, but there are no duds. Some songs are a little more catchy, while some songs are a little more darker and haunting, but equally as good.In a music era where originality is rarely found...Josh Ritter is a breath of fresh air. With every album he becomes more refined...I'm excited to see what is next, but in the mean time I'll enjoy this album over and over again!"
4,Ritter Rocks,"Josh Ritter is a singer songwriter who has quickly built a reputation for outstanding lyrics, melody and performances. In Conquests he sucessfully expands his range to rock. This cd will introduce new people to Ritter, while opening new horizons for those of us who were fortunate enough to discover him when he was an unknown opener for Joan Baez and follow his growth since then."
4,It grows on you!,"As a Josh Ritter newbie, I was pleasantly surprised by the music and lyrics of this album. The more I listen to it, the more I like it."
4,He's done it,"My previous problem w/ Josh Ritter was that despite the intensity and inventiveness of his lyrics and delivery, the music was lacking. No more. The songs on this album are truly songs, not just pieces of music and lyrics. He truly comes into his own on this album."
4,"New Direction, Good Album","I've been following Josh Ritter since a friend introduced me to Golden Age of Radio, and he is one of my favorite artists. Historical Conquests features more rock influences than previous Josh Ritter albums, and this is not necessarily a bad thing. Standout Tracks include To the Dogs or Whoever, Right Moves, and Temptation of Adam, which features some of Josh's best writing to date. Historical Conquests is not quite as good as The Animal Years, which came out in 2006, but is still a solid album."
2,A Warren Ellis fan weighs in...,"Simply put, I love Warren Ellis, but this comic had some of the most atrocious artwork I've ever seen. If you care IN THE LEAST about the art quality, I'd say skip this one. The story is good, but the terrible illustration destroys it."
5,We love Trumpet!,My daughter and I went and saw Carson read this book at a local bookstore. He was so charming and the book was so cute with such a great message - I bought several copies for gifts. I highly recommend it.
4,A good basic reference on the subject,"A good reference book. The first section is organised by decades - 1900s to 1990s - with an interesting commentary of the trends, developments, designers and fashion movers and shakers of each decade. The main section of the book is then an alphabetical listing of designers, obviously with more information on some than others. Both sections are quite well illustrated. The only problem if have is who is left out - where is Elie Saab, for one? Otherwise, this is a very good introductory reference book."
1,Tacky!,"I bought this bathing suit because it looked cute in the picture and the price was right, but the reality is that this bathing suit is cheaply made, looks horrible on and should not be sold for young girls."
5,NICE QUALITY AND MADE IN THE USA!,"8"" measurement is along the fold. Will accommodate a compact but not the extra magazine. The 11"" may work better."
5,Made in the USA. Excellent Soft Pistol Case,"great case for all your pistols. Great quality. I bought this one for my 6"" Colt Anaconda and it fits just right. Also have these cases for my other colt 1911's."
5,Gun rug,"Very good product the material is top notch, will be used to go back and forth from the gun range and very compact A Plus"
5,Handgun case,This case is excellent quality and my revolver fits in it perfect. I really like the fleece lining inside the case. The price is outstanding for this handgun case.
4,Looking good,I purchased this product for my husband and he really likes it. It arrived on time and in good condition. No complain here.
4,Pretty nice bag,"I started out thinking the 11"" would work for my Sig Sauer P232-----it didn't, much too large, but the 8"" is just right. I love the sheepskin type padding and even though it could easily soil with a dirty gun (due to the light color) I don't mind at all. I tend to carry a shop rag or two in my range bag and simply wrap a dirty pistol to mitigate any issues; the bag will accomodate this easily if your pistol is the same or smaller in size as mine. (comparison pictures added above)"
5,Suede Gun Case,"I really like these suede gun cases. The suede is not slippery in the hand when carrying, they hold the firearm firmly inside, and ""nest"" nicely in a gym bag I use to carry multiple firearms. As an NRA instructor, I have seen many different cases and these are my favorite. The only improvement I can think of, is a Muzzle ""pocket"" to protect the muzzle."
2,flaw design,"The case is well made, material is pretty nice. Inside out doesn't look cheap at all.But unfortunately the guy who designed the case obviously never shot a gun before. He doesn't knowhow dirty a pistol could get after just a few shots. The inside of the case is made of fluffy white fur,Am I supposed to clean my gun every time before putting it in?"
1,Sadly Disappointing,"I am very disappointed in this ""beret."" It is classified as ""one size fits all"", but what they fail to tell you is that it is a child's size hat. The hat is so small, and so tight, it seems as if the company is scrimping on material. I am very disappointed, as Isotoner is a name I thought I could trust. The ""beret"" does not even fall into a proper shape, but is so small that it becomes a bizarre-looking beanie. This was to be a Christmas present, and now I have to go through the pains of mailing it back as a return. Lesson learned: I'll never buy another hat online again."
5,Best deal on the market!,"These cost at least twice as much at a local supply store, so even with shipping (which was minimal) I still saved a bunch of money. They are high durable metal, not plastic, and fit very well. Thanks for a great bargain!"
4,Complete & complex.,"This one volume biography of FDR is probably the best distillate possible, though the task is daunting and the result is less than perfect. At times, the book 'drags' a bit, particularly through the 30s. Explanations of New Deal politics perhaps don't lend themselves to the kind of exciting story-telling that wartime meetings at places such as Tehran and Yalta do. In fact, I sometimes felt the book lapsed into an economics textbook, but it is still mostly quite readable. Freidel does not editorialize much about his subject and so (fortunately) one is left to draw one's own conclusions about FDR."
2,"Dry, Boring Prose","When I read the other reviews I wondered if we had read the same book. Unlike the other reviewers, I thought the prose was dry and the details lacking. I don't really mind that the author has a pro-Roosevelt bias, but he breezes over the highlights of Roosevelt's life without giving out any juicy details. It reminded me of my old high school textbooks. There are better Roosevelt biographies out there."
3,Unchained is the weakest link,"Though pleased overall with this recording i think it must be seen in relation to the other American Recordings with Rick Rubin I, III, IV & Vheard as a whole these recordings make John Cash a whole new reputation for a new audience. Please buy Unchained but dont let the opportunity go buy collect the other 4 and Cry Cry Cry"
5,He Just Gets Better,"Getting older doesn't diminish Johnny's voice or ability to record a song. In fact, I grew up with his music, and I believe this to be some of the best I've heard him do. It's an upbeat, uptown, clear sound country. Pop fans will love it too."
4,Johnny Cash Unchained,"Really enjoy listening to this CD, Johnny Cash was in his 60's when he sang these songs and his voice is as strong and as clear as ever. Most of the songs, really stick in your head, like 'Rowboat', 'Rusty Cage' and 'Country Boy'. His song 'Spiritual' seems totally sincere and 'I've Been Everywhere' shows he was at the top of his game."
5,My favorite American Recording,"Unchained typically gets lesser reviews than the other American Recordings. This neglect is undeserved. Simply put, Unchained rocks. Johnny's voice is rich, deep, and powerful, just as we like it, and the backing band supplies a hearty country-rock sound to complement. This album is comprised of a combination of country classics and more recent country and rock, all of which Cash performs masterfully. The cover of ""Sea of Heartbreak"" is the most outstanding track on the album, and has become my favorite Johnny Cash song, hands down. ""Rowboat,"" ""I Never Picked Cotton,"" and ""I've Been Everywhere"" (of course) are also gems, performed with a definite Cash sound. This album admittedly departs sharply from traditional Johnny Cash recordings, both acoustic and backed by the Tennessee Three, but this difference is not a grounds for criticism. Rather, it demonstrates Johnny's ability to master a new style, and demonstrate that he was still a badass, even in the '90s."
5,Better than I and III,"1. What is the text about? An album by Cash, backed most of the time by Tom Petty and many Heartbreakers (I think). Popular songs countrified and Cash's own work.2. What is good about it? The songs are great, and Cash's voice has a power that often transcends the work. Petty's backing, particularly on ""Sea of Heartbreak,"" is great. Also fantastic is Cash's cover of Beck's ""Rowboat,"" and ""Country Boy.""3. What is not so good about it? Well, you might not like it if you hate country music, but then again, you might.4. Who might like it? Those fans who like myself dabble in genres other than rock music (e.g. fans of Lyle Lovett, De La Soul, Dwight Yoakum) will like it. Classic country fans of people Willie Nelson will also dig it.5. Personal bias: I think Cash is almost as important to the history of popular music in America as Elvis Presley."
4,Unchained,"The second of the five ""American"" recordings which concluded Cash's career and also guaranteed his immortality.These albums,produced by Rick Rubin,placed Cash's personal history and observations on life and death,right and wrong,in a contemporary setting.""If it's commercial must be of absolutely no concern"" states the sleeve notes and,backed by Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers,Cash delivers.This is a love song to June Carter.He goes back to pre-war American icons ( Jimmie Rodgers,The Carter Family ),he sings the song from his brother's funeral ( when Cash was 12 ),he recalls Elvis and he refers to the South,citing Petty's "" Southern Accents "" as "" better than Dixie "".As with all of the American recordings,this music is a privelege to listen to.This is music for grown-ups,who've seen good and bad,who've known loss and known fear.But,finally,this is music of redemption.A "" state of grace "" sounds like this.Music to be treasured."
5,Johnny at his best,"When I first heard the American Recordings, I wasn't too interested in it. I was more of a fan of older Cash, and figured these recordings were just like later works of other artists trying to reclaim their lost glory. It wasn't until I listened to them a few times however that I realized how wrong I was. ""Unchained"" is not a weaker Cash, just a different direction, and one that I found I enjoyed even more than the original songs of his that lead me to become a fan in the first place. The great thing about this album is that Johnny's voice and guitar playing really stand out. These are all covers of more contemporary works, but Johnny finds a way to make them his own, especially because his versions sound so different than the original artist's once he adds his deep southern voice to them. I found myself listening to ""Rusty Cage"" over and over. While I enjoy all of the American Recordings, I find that this one appeals the most to me."
5,Wow!!!,"Unbelievable. I've been listening to JR for 30++ years. I got the first American Recordings cd about a month ago, and thought it was the best. That was before i got this one. With this one, i got my rock-a-billy back. It seems like JR's vitality came back after the success of the first one. I especially like ""Country Boy"" and ""Mean-eyed Cat"". Highly recommend this one to one and all."
5,A great album from a great man,"Johnny Cash has always done things his way and no one else's, which is why he alone is in both the Country and Rock-n-Roll Halls of Fame. This album is the perfect embodiment of both genres. As he sings ""Rusty Cage"", accompanied by Tom Petty's snarling guitar, you can almost see him again flipping off the country music establishment and their idea of what people want to hear in these ""modern times"". This album is worth a stack of Garth Brooks CDs, as is ""American Recordings"". Both are must-buys."
3,bad packaging,Speakers are used but looked and sound as promised(good). Only issue was they were poorly packaged and one was damaged. If that could have been avaoided I would be 1005 happy with purchase.
4,Vicarious Tour,"This would be a nice beach book: not to deep, reasonably well written. And some nice reflections on an Alaska that is changing, and the people who live there."
5,Evoking Alaska,"I spent my teenage years in Fairbanks and traveled from Bristol Bay to the Arctic Circle, though not even nearly as intimately and exhaustively as Ned Rozell. But luckily I found his book through a family member there who knows him. His descriptions of the landscapes, the characters, the attitudes, and even the whine of the mosquitoes all take me back to Alaska. It's absolutely true to the people and places I knew and it makes for a delightful read! Plus, I can't tell you how grateful I am to escape to the land of the midnight sun when it is 112 degrees here in central California. I hereby solemnly swear to take my kids to canoe on the Chena and pick wild blueberries on Ester Dome next summer!"
2,Pretty slow reading,"Even though I love Alaska and most books about it, I found this book pretty slow. I like the fact that the book tells the stories of people who live along the pipeline, but I was probably expecting more adventure...Therefore, it took me more than a month to finish it...I enjoyed the extracts about Jane and the affection he feels for her, but unfortunately they are very rare exceptions."
5,Read this Book!,"I really enjoyed this book and purchased it after reading Ned's online journal of his trek through the Alaskan wilderness. I too could not put it down and have ordered a few copies to give to people as gifts. There really is something in this for everyone, from young to old and not only do you get an honest glimpse into the author's life, but also a look at the lives of the people that he meets along the way.I grew up in same town as Ned, attended the same high school and recognize a similiar outlook on life as many of my friends from there. I hope someday he considers writing about that part of his own ""journey""."
2,"Inconsistent, confusing & sloppy","As a researcher attempting to use this book as a preliminary source of data/information, I have found that Geist throws around numbers without ensuring that they match ones cited earlier or later in the text; Appendix values don't match the text; some are rounded, some not; with the sloppy citations he uses, some even appear to have been plucked out of thin air. The appendix is essentially unreadable: citations, data & notes are presented in the most illogical & unintuitive format possible. Plus there are plenty of typos scattered throughout, making you question the publisher's editing skills. Granted some of the text is very interesting & informative but here again, poor formatting thwarts the reader's efforts to understand.I was originally thrilled to find this book but now I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."
3,decent rings,"got these rings because i have more keys than the key maker, including a lot that are single copies that i need to lend to people for various reasons. i had planned to put one key to a ring and put them on a big clip or something similar. these rings worked fine for smaller keys, but anything that was a little thicker caused the rings to stretch and then not return to the original shape. i still have a bunch left, and learned my lesson, will pay a bit more for nicer ones next time."
5,A Travesty,There is absolutely no reason why this album should be out of print. None. This album is timeless. It's gorgeous. It sounds like dreams lost and dreams recovered. It's sheer perfection.
4,"The Jayhawks - Contains Their Best Song ""Blue""","If I remember correctly I first came to notice the Jayhawks after hearing the single from this album, the opening track ""Blue"". It is still a favorite of mine and one of the best songs this band has ever done. Most Jayhawks fans tend to rate ""Hollywood Town Hall"" over this album, but for me I think I like this one a bit better. The music is still roots rock Americana with maybe a bit more country influence this time around. Along with ""Blue"" other highlights include, ""I'd Run Away"", ""Miss Williams Guitar"", ""Nothing Left To Borrow"", ""Ann Jane"" and the album closer ""10 Little Kids"". Jayhawks albums never blow me away, but I do like them for what they are. This is another strong effort if you are a fan of this genre of American music."
5,"Come clean Mark Olsen, you are Gram reincarnated","I came to the Jayhawks the wrong way round via Rainy Day Music but having already a working knowledge of Burrito Bros, Gram Parsons I was astounded to hear how the early Jayhawks with Mark Olsen are the aural spitting image of Gram Parsons but tighter and with a better ear for melody. The vocals are not overproduced like Eagles harmonies but a great natural live sound. Track 7 Bad Time is as finer pop tune as you would find anywhere. The lyrics shift from endearing to whimsy in the flash of an eye and are driven along by some great guitar work. (particularly 12 string) Miss Williams Guitar and Ten Little Kids are real fun almost bluegrass and Blue is another driven country rock tune. Every track is a winner and the Jayhawks are a knockout"
3,No Wilco,"In my opinion the best of the Jayhawks album, but the energy of the first three songs slowly wears out over the course of the album and never really comes back. I guess with some artists you just have to be a fan - and I'm, not the biggest Jayhawks fan,..."
3,Why all the fuss?? It's only okay,"Not sure which song has anybody excited here. I bought this one a few years back and listened to it 10-12 times before it found it's way among the rarely listened-to CD's. This is fine music, but nothing very memorable. The cover of Grand Funk's ""Bad Time"" is very good, but doesn't improve on the original. The opening track, Blue is also a good one. The singing, playing all just okay and the songwriting also just fine. There are several tracks that I just skip by. It's very easy to find better music than this."
5,These guys ROCK!,"I was quite impressed with this effort from the Jayhawks. Beyond the haunting opener ""Blue"", Tomorrow The Green Grass packs some solid lyrics as well as some awesome gutar hooks. A definite must have for the Jayhawks collection"
4,Decent,"The JBL Harmony certainly has quite a good sound quality for its size. The fact that the display is not that good hasn't been a problem at all since I just put my cheep digital clock next to it. The sound balance of this system tends to select the type of music it can play well. Popular/rock music sound best on this system since it has a powerful bass. Although I might be demanding too much for this price range, classical music does not sound good. In general, the cymbals sound cheep, or rather, the bass is sometimes too powerful that it tends to cover up the details. I sometimes got the impression that the music was flat and not very interesting. Jazz is inbetween rock and classical music.If you are in college and don't want to be carrying huge boxes every year when you move out during the summertime, this is the product you want within this price range. If you are looking for good sound and you don't mind the capacity, I recommend that you rather assemble a system by yourself."
4,JBL Harmony Premium CD/radio clock,"Overall this is very nice combination CD player and FM radio for the bedroom or office. The unit has internal speakers and recessed slot in the rear to pick the unit up. The construction is solid and together with the looks, has a luxury feel. There is plenty of nice bass although I would prefer also a tone control to sometimes bring out more treble. There is also an AUX input and the antenna is a wire ""T""My Harmony has given me a couple of slight problems. One was a quiet occasional beep sound when on, because the unit was too close to a cordless phone base station. The other is a very slight buzz in the base (after a year), presumably from the power supply. A good hard wack on the base stops it for a couple of weeks at a time."
5,Great Product - Used Daily for 10 Years!,"I purchased this item to use as an alarm clock in 1998. I love the fact that you can set two different alarms on the clock, and the sound is very good. After 10 years of almost daily use in an environment with lots of cat hair, I am just now having a small problem with the unit - I'm hearing background noise in the CD player that may mean the CD part of the unit is going bad or may just mean 10 years of cat hair needs to be cleaned out. If this unit becomes available I would have no concerns with buying another one."
1,Buyer beware,"This is a great little system, and I would've given it 4 stars. But I have to throw it out. A power surge killed the power transformer, and the part is no longer available. Sad when a company doesn't support its products."
1,Not a good book for begginers,This book is a waste of money if you are a begginer. The author assumes you know all the theories of music. if you don't have at least 10 years of playing experience don't purchase this book you will regret it terribly.
3,6 year old absolutely loves it!,"6 yr old absolutely loved it when he opened it foe Christmas, however the batteries were dead. I noticed it was from 1999, which would be understandable in 2011, so with a new batteryworks like a charm."
5,Extraordinary Southern Literature,"This is one of the finest works of southern literature that I have ever read. I recommend it very highly. Every page is filled with great writing, passion and beauty.Gerry Stern"
3,A SLIGHT BUT ENJOYABLE NOIR PIECE,"Based on a story by mystery writer Donald Westlake, this movie benefits from an Emmy nominated performance from the always reliable William H. Macy. Macy plays a movie critic who finds himself in a pickle when an argument with his lover leads to her accidental death. A game of cat and mouse ensues when a sleazy private investigator who was following the woman realizes Macy has killed her.Macy has some choice moments as he addresses the audience during his dilemma and receives good support from his real life wife Felicity Huffman who plays his other girlfriend and from crusty James Cromwell as the PI. Adam Arkin is also very good as the police detective who sees Macy as a channel to get his screenplay sold. A twisty plot involves Macy and Arkin's wife, with the resultant resolution appropos.Entertaining variation on the noir genre."
3,Very Slight,"I found this movie to be cute and funny in some places, and strangely repellent in others. The overall premise was good, and there were lots of great scenes like the bank robbery, and appealing characters like the detective with a screenplay (Adam Arkin) and the protagonists sassy girlfriend Kit (Felicity Huffman) but as the story continued, the main character became less and less likable, and the so called villains more likable. Nor was this just some ploy to show that we're all human underneath or something, because the tone of the film was still flippant and disturbing. The screenplay was unbalanced. In its attempt to give us a flawed anti-hero like all good film noirs, it created a bit of a monster."
5,ok,its an okay movie bill macy and felicty huffman was really good as far as the acting goes but the movie was kinda just boring itself..but its worth watching though.
3,Another 'comedy' neo-noir.,"It is probably the reductio ad absurdum of the self-conscious neo-noir that its ultimate hero/villain/victim should be a film critic, about as far removed from the original prole/lower-middle-class noir heroes (e.g. 'The Postman Always Rings Twice', 'Double Indemnity') as you could get. Faced with a crisis (he accidentally murders his lover), Terry Thorpe turns it into a screenplay, a fiction - if he plays by the film noir rules, he can worm his way out of it. And this is what saves the film from smart-alecky ghastliness - it is a film about mid-life crisis, the flaws and difficulties of the modern, affluent, middle-aged man. It seems like noir can still speak for people rather than to itself, but this often palls. the best joke is a corpse called Laura who doesn't get up."
4,A great baseline study text,"Just began using this in an Acts Bible Study and find, after consulting other, more erudite texts on this Scripture, that this small volume is a great jumping-off resource. Kurz introduces controversial issues around the content and leaves the reader with food for thought and a direction for further investigation. The modest cost also makes it within reach for those who may be unable to consider purchasing more scholarly works. I recommend it to those with limited time but a desire to delve deeper into Acts. We love it."
1,Molly P dolls hair literally FALLS RIGHT OFF,"My daughter collects dolls and she was just in LOVE with the Molly P Originals dolls. [..] Its like a wig glued on cheaply. My daughter is 15 years old now.. so she doesn't ""play"" with her dolls.. she has a special case for them. What is worse is, even after contacting this company,they didn't even respond! NEVER EVER AGAIN!"
2,"great for charging, won't sync","This is a great replacement for the original usb cable and dongle if all you want to do is recharge your Creative Zen Vision:M. However, I have been unable get it to sync with any computer, and I've tried at least three."
5,Works as advertised,"I'm sure you are looking at this becasue you lost the little addapter for your vision M right? Dont want to pay 20+ buck for a replacement(if you can find one), well this is a great replacement. Charges and Syncs the Vision M. Nothing else to say, for less than 2 bucks how can you go wrong? Plus as soon as you get this thing the adapter will probly show up."
4,"good price, syncs & charges 30 GB Zen, but no A/V out","For my Zen Vision:M 30 GB, this cable charges and syncs with my WinXP laptop, so I haven't experienced the problems some others mention. But, I've also synced before with the original dongle and haven't tried using this cable after a clean install, so I can't say much about that. So far, it works great!I gave it 4/5 stars b/c there's no A/V out port and no place to plug in the wall adapter like there is on the original dongle from Creative. But I guess that's OK, considering this cable was <$1 :)."
1,Cable doesn't transfer data,"Cable charges from some computers, but not all, and DOES NOT transfer any data nor is it recognized as a device by any computer I have tried. I have the Zen Vision M 60gb. The packaging says it's for a Zen Vision M."
1,So old you need to find the drivers,"Good thing I only paid less than two dollars for this cord. It doesn't work with recent technology, and you have to go searching for a driver."
1,charges but doesn't sync,Charges just fine but pc won't read player therefore I am unable to transfer songs onto the player. Main reason for buying the damn thing. oh well...
1,Not for an Iphone or Ipod,"Great price, but both my ipod and iphone know that this device is not an Apple product. Doesn't synch or charge either device on a Mac or in a converter. No stars."
2,charges but doesn't sync,"I thought my player wasn't recognizing Linux, but when I got on my windows computer, my vision m just turns on when it's plugged in but the arrows that signify it's transferring data won't come on and the computer doesn't recognize that anything is there. I wish there was a replacement for the original cable that came with it!"
2,Charge is good but not so good with the syncing,This has a big or minor problem depending on your needs. It doesn't sync with your computer if you haven't synced with a dongle before hand. My computer wasn't able to see my player until I used the dongle but I was still able to charge using this cable.So to be clear of what I mean is I can sync using this cable but only after using a dongle. If the dongle gets lost and I have to reinstall the software I won't be able able to sync using this cable. I might just have gotten a bad one because I don't see any other reviews that talks about this. Or maybe they didn't try this cable on fresh install of the software that was never used with the dongle.It is still worth buying just to be able to charge via usb.
4,review,"It's a cable nothing fancy. It just plain works. Beats paying around 5 bucks for a usb cable and another 20 for the adapter. Shipping, however, did take a little longer than expected considering i paid for expedited shipping and consequently i ended up going on the road with no music. That's the only reason i'm giving this 4 stars instead of 5."
1,"No Sync, but charger works","Like many of the others using this cable, the device isn't ""seen' when plugged into the computer. Therefore, no sync with this.I also had trouble getting the adapter to fit into my Zen 60GB even after I found the pinchers on each side of the adapter. It is not a smooth fit like the original dongle.It works for charging, but with the long battery life, syncing while away from home was my major need for this cable. 1 Star.It was a Christmas gift, so I can't say anything about the delivery or vendor."
1,Just O.K.,"The ""Ice Crusher"" is a Ice Shaver! You also cannot put more than 3 to 4 ice cubes at a time, so if you need alot it will take a while. Last, it is very noisy!!"
1,deni ice crusher review,I use crushed ice when I have medical problems. I have'nt had any since I purchased the unit. Therefore I have nothing to report.
1,AWFUL,"Do not buy...will not crush regular ice tray cubes....I mean it...if you place one cube in, it might succeed in crushing it, but as they say you can ""fill up"" the holding area with cubes, unless they are minuscule, won't do the job...Just a waste of time and effort to get it, try it, and return. Beware!"
2,One ice cube at a time...,"Yes, this electric ice crusher does work, however, it will only work if you put in just ONE ICE CUBE at a time. So if you need a FAST ice crusher, then this is not a good purchase for you, and you'll need to look for a ""professional ice crusher"" (which cost ALOT!).For the price, I suppose this ice crusher is OK, because it certainly is better than the crank-style ice crushers. But if you are in a hurry to crush many cubes, then please note that you will have to start way ahead of schedule ."
5,ice crusher,"It is great for every refreshing drinks, i use it to make ""halo-halo"" (mix), mixture of sweetened beans,young coconut,flan,jackfruit etc. sweets, put them in a nice big glass then add crushed ice on top and milk mixed them all together....yummy!!!!! the only thing that i find that can slow you down if you put too much pieces of big ice it will get stock so few piesec at a time.........."
1,easy-break ice crusher,"The product worked fine till it broke, about 2 weeks after using it.The blades bent.Now, I am stuck w/an ice crusher that I cannot use, because it was a gift and have no place to return it.If you want an ice crusher that lasts, don't buy this one!"
2,Don't use it too hard!,"Great product when we received it- makes crushed ice like nobody's business. Very fine ice. HOWEVER... it only lasted about two weeks. Within that time it started to make loud noises, and then one of the two blades on the inside of the machine broke off. Amazon replaced the machine with no problem, but I have not used it since. I went on to another more sturdy machine. Would be ok for the occasional user- we were using it 3-4 times a day."
2,Didn't last very long,"I really like shaved and crushed ice, so I bought my Deni 6000 and started using it 1-2 times daily. I was perfectly happy with the ice that came out of the machine, but it did bounce around the counter while operating. The main problem was that after only a couple of weeks one of the metal shaving blades broke off, and this turned out not to be repairable. So, I was happy with the thing for a short period of time, but it didn't last long."
4,Seems to work well so far,"I purchased this for my Father-in-law and unfortunately the unit would not even turn on. Amazon quickly sent another unit out to him (thank's Amazon) and the second unit works perfectly.If it were not for the first defective unit,I would give it 5 stars. He uses it every day and has had no problems."
2,Suitable for occasional home use only.,I was hoping for a crsher that could provide ice for a couple of drinks quickly. This unit can deal with one or two ice cubes at a time. It will eventually get there but I wanted one I could handle a handful of cubes all at the same time. Long and short it's OK but that's all.
3,ice crusher,We got the ice crusher and the problem is that you really have to feed one cube at a time... it does a fine job. but takes a long time...
5,Great Drinks,"I purchased this Ice Crusher to make some great Icy drinks, the unit works perfectly and the crushed ice blends much better that trying to use whole ice cubes"
4,A nice little machine for the money,"Yes, it's noisy when crushing ice, but that's hardly surprising. Once you get the hang of it, you can feed a few cubes at a time. For me, the bottom line is: price is reasonable and it works. If it broke, I would immediately buy another one to replace it."
1,Worked great at first...,"Worked great at first. After having it a while, one of the 'fins' inside broke off into my shaved ice.When I looked down inside the unit, and at the piece that broke off, it was apparent that the unit is not built with durability in mind. Buying 'less expensive' sometimes gives you CHEAP."
1,Ice Crusher---It stinks!,"Arrived with a broken plastic dome, but Amazon made good on it.Does not crush ice very well. My old hand operated crusher was better. Might look for one of those.In short, it stinks!"
2,Deni 6000 ice crusher.,I can not crush more than one ice cube at a time. I put three in and it won't even start up. It hums and waits for a one at a time feed.
3,Blades don't stand up well.,I bought the ice crusher in March 2011. One blade broke off about 2 months later and the last cutting(crushing) edge or blade in October 2011. Other wise does good job for the price.Would pay 10 extra dollars for stronger crushing blade.
4,Crushes away,Took quite a long time to ship but it is a good ice crusher. I would recommend to a friend.
3,??????,i place my order on the 13th of april. i have just realized that it will not received my order until well after the first of may!! it is still being prepared to be shipped. i am a little confused and irritated by this.thanks
4,good product,"This product does a good job, although the poeces are smaller than the description shows. It serves the purpose."
4,"Ice crusher makes perfect ice chips! Not too big, not too small.","I dont know what other people are talking about, saying that the chips are too small or are the size of snow cone chips because it is not just snow sized crystals. The crystals are a good size, not too big, not too small. The ice is a little bigger than the ice in a slushy. (Check out my pics).You can load more than 1 ice cube at a time in the chopper but it is tricky to drop one in when the ice cube is bouncing around inside. I got about 3 in at a time and kept adding cubes like this until I got a cup full in about 30 seconds.The ice crusher is very noisy, but that is to be expected because the chopper is spinning very fast and throwing the ice at a metal chopper. Not that big of a deal. Ice crusher needs to be held because it might move around but thats not that big a deal because if you complain that it moves around, just hold it down. Otherwise your just lazy.Feels very quality made."
1,Nearly worthless...,This item crushes ONE CUBE AT A TIME???Wish I'd read the reviews before ordering -- it would have saved me the hassle of returning it!
2,"Great ice shaver, lousy ice crusher","Deni should of called this an ice shaver vs an ice crusher. If you want to make snowcones, its great. Be prepared to feed the hopper ice cubes 1 by 1, because thats about all that will fit. If you want ice chips, buy a good blender or one of those hand crank ice crushers. On the plus side, it is stylish and the motor is quiet. If you want snowcones, buy it. But if you want good old chipped ice, don't!"
4,"Does okay, but could stand improvement","Does a good job at crushing the ice, though a little inconsistent in quality. The feed hopper can only take one to two cubes at a time so it is a little time consuming. Works well for small amounts, however you can do it ahead and store the crushed ice in the freezer. Sure beats the hand crank version."
1,Poor wording and terminology inconsistencies.,"This book is written decently if you are using it a professional reference text. As class textbook it is a poor choice for one reason. The terminology used in the chapter questions does not match up with the terminology used in the rest of the text about half the time. Students are left wondering what the questions are really asking and what some the new terms mean. This book makes the topics way more complicated than they need to be, and it is all a result of terminology inconsistencies."
4,A very broad picture of networking with latest technologies.,"I don't buy books normally. But after reading thru halfway, here I'm trying to get one desparately....!!"
2,Faulty product,"I purchased this book for my graduate class and I eventually noticed that this book is missing a substantial number of pages from chapters 6 and 7 to include the bulk of the subject material from chapter 6 and all of chapter 7. Missing also are the problem sets from both chapters hindering my ability to complete my course assignments. I don't know if this has been a serious problem with this edition from the publisher or what, but I'm very disappointed in my purchase of this book only to run into this."
3,A Good Resource,"This book does not cover as many topics as I would have liked, but it is very current and appears to be accurate. Stallings can be a bit dry."
1,an excellent tutorial on networking,"If you have some digital bacjground and want tolearn about networking technolog, this book is theway to go....It is an excellent tutorial on networking"
1,Terrible book,"Strongly not recommended. The ideas are not clearly explained, and even in some examples the book simply glosses over details, giving the impression of 'it's trivial' (which is synonym that the author was lazy).Tenenbaum's book is much better at explaining concepts, and you're better off reading Wikipedia and the RFC's if you want to understand the protocols."
3,Interesting stuff.,"most interesting part of this book was adsl, cable, vdsl because our family are using FastAccess DSL(adsl with 1.5 megabyte patch)from Bellsouth(which is merged with At&T)."
3,Excellent text for an instructor lead course in data com,This is an excellent introduction into the scientific study of data communications for beginners. The first six chapters cover the heart of data com with the remaining chapters providing a simple overview of LAN and WAN technologies.
1,No driver for Windows NT. Picture quality is poor.,The setup was relatively easy until I tried to hook it up to my PC. There is no driver available for Windows NT workstation. I tried to install it under Windows 95. Spent most of my Saturday with downloading drivers from their website. Finally called tech support and got email back that someone will call me in 2-3 days and also to be patient. Color quality is ok. I could print from my Sony Digital camcorder. It takes about 2 minutes to print a 4-5 in. picture. Save your money and get something else. This printer is not ready for any prime time yet. At least they should include a driver that works.
4,Good for what it is,This is not an Office printer. It print as good as a 35mm film camera does. Do not expect any thing else. Small paper high cost but best picture that U can get.
2,Where's the ink?,You will never hear me complain about the fantastic quality of the Olympus P330 pictures. But good luck finding the paper/ink packets for sale. This is a dye sublimation printer so it is a real four-color process print like the professionals use. But before you buy be sure you can find a seller who will sell you 60 photo pack ink refills for under $75. Check the other feedback dates. This is an old printer circa 1998.
3,olympus p-330 photo printer,"the printer gave very good results, but see no need for all the insturction books, (2) that come with the printer. Everything said could surly be condensed to one simple to read and use set of insturctions. there should be a better system to tell what you are going to print before you print it."
1,P-330/Sony Digital Camera,"There are suggestioons, including on Amazon.com that the P-330 and a Sony Digital Camera that uses 3.5"" floppy disks are compatible. To a limited extemt this may be true, but direct use is not possible as the P-330 only takes the smaller Smart Media disk. It would appear one would be well advised to use a Sony printer that can directly receive the 3.5"" floppy disk; otherwise one of the feature attractions of a printer is defeated. The one star rating is only in connection with a Sony digital camera."
4,Cute glasses for a great price,"These sunglasses are neutral enough to flatter many faces, yet are stylish enough to stand out a bit. One concern I had was that my glasses arrived with somewhat unevenly bent bows (ear pieces). Apparently, though, this is something that can be easily fixed at most eyeglass stores, as they can heat the bows and simply bend them back into shape. After this, the glasses fit me great."
4,BILL HUDSON STILL PICKING,"BILL'S LATEST BRINGS BACK MEMORIES OF WARM SUMMER NITES AND DASH BOARD LITES. THE STEVEN FAYNE EARL OVERTONES ARE GREAT. THE THING THAT MOST FOLKS NEED TO DO IS SEE BILL BRING THE MUSIC TO LIFE. HE IS A MASTER SONG-SMITH AND PUTS HIS HEART INTO WHAT HE SEEMS TO LOVE MOST AND THAT IS WRITING ABOUT US. YES YOU AND I. I,MYSELF HAVE HAD THE PLEASURE OF NOT ONLY HEARING THE CD BUT ALSO PASSING A SONG AROUND THE ROOM WITH HIM. BEING A MERE BEGINNER AT THIS CRAFT, BILL HAS BEEN KIND AND SUPPORTIVE OF MY OWN WAY WITH A SONG. THANX BILL FOR THE MUSIC. I CANT WAIT FOR THE NEW CD COMING OUT SOON."
5,ABSOLUTELY THE GREATEST SOPRANO OF THE 20TH CENTURY,"I had the great good fortune to hear Ms Berberian live in the early seventies perform most of the music included on this disk.The event was one of the high points of my childhood.As at home singing avant-garde as she was singing pop and classical music, many composers wrote for Ms. Berberian simply because there were no other singers accomplished enough to bring their musical visions alive.This disk offers up a wonderful cross-section of all of thekinds of music in Cathy's vast repertoire. I recommend it most highly"
2,Not My Thing,"Hi, my husband and I tried Stevia to use in our coffee as a sugar substitute and we didn't like it. It made our coffee have a weird taste and smell. It also left a weird aftertaste in our mouths when we were done. We decided to use Agave Nectar instead and we like that much better. It's cheaper too."
4,Excellent But With A Qualification,"The title of Robert Dallek's FDR & AMERICAN FOREIGN POLICY actually describes this book very neatly: it's a comprehensive overview of all US foreign policy during the Roosevelt II Administration -- not just US policy relative to the emerging Axis powers, but also to Latin America and elsewhere.As the title also might suggest, this is basically a scholarly book, not really suitable for readers who haven't obtained a general idea of the broad sweep of American international politics in the era. It's for readers who want to get the nitty-gritty on the matter and it can even be a bit of a slog for them. As scholarly books go, however, it is not extremely long nor particularly dry; but it's not a book for casual reading, either."
5,Great bit!,"As usual from Freud, excellent quality! A razor sharp bit! 1/2"" bit is a big step up from the 1/4"" bits!"
4,Tracks,"1. Nightingale 2. City lights 3. Laughter in the rain 4. Back home again 5. My eyes adored you 6. You're the first, the last, my everything 7.Look in my eyes pretty woman 8. Near you 9. Sweet surrender 10. Only you 11. Once is not enough."
1,Does Not Work,First off - A+ seller... got here in decent time... Product does not work at all... i have had no changes in my skin tone. luckily i didnt get any of the side effects either. Just won't purchase ever again :( i was really excited after reading reviews of european users... too bad didn't work at all for me. :( i would send back but it's not the sellers fault it's useless...
1,"Great at first, but literally fell apart after light use","Bought this on another site for my 1 year old Christmas 2009. He loved it the first dozen times he used it and the train held up nicely. Then after almost a year, the train literally fell apart when we picked it up. Shocking, since it was only used every once and again-definitely not heavy, or even moderate use. Engine came apart, wheels fell off, front piece too. Granted, I did assemble it myself, but it worked and lasted for a while, then suddenly-poof. Still a household mystery. Would not recommend bc if the disappearing quality."
1,DON'T ORDER THIS FROM HERE!!,"It is incorrect that these are ""in stock"". They aren't and took them two days to let us know and now we can't get one for the kids by Christmas. Don't make the same mistake!!"
3,The Past Casts a Shadow on the Present,"""The Past"" is actually the protagonist in this novel about the Canadian-born daughter of Japanese immigrants. The writer masterfully creates for the reader the sense of claustrophobia and inertia ""Ann"" feels, with the division between her active mind and irrelevant body made tangible by the descriptions of her unkempt clothes,her dirty hair,the stockings she hoards, and her reaction to the dog, the pet of Yano and his family. The novel is written carefully, never revealing too much about the characters. We are left exhausted, drained, in a state of torpor. Ultimately an unpleasant novel about unpleasant characters, but enriched by its sense of time and place and the fusion of past and present."
4,Creepy Yet Amazing,The author wrote this book in a way that makes the reader both disgusted and compassionate towards the narrator of the novel. I would definitely suggest this novel to others.
2,Pretty lousy effort,"The Eagles' last A very lackluster effort. Even the hits aren't all that great. ""Heartache Tonight"" lacks sufficient punch. ""I Can't Tell You Why"" is just plain boring, too slow, and way too long. ""The Long Run"" was a hit but is of B-side quality.Too bad this was the Eagles' last studio effort. They certainly missed their opportunity to go out with a bang."
4,The Last Run,"The Eagles were always better at producing first rate singles than recording consistently good albums, and the ""The Long Run"" should be judged with that in mind. Lacking any song that comes close to the mastery of the title track to ""Hotel California,"" the album that proceeded it, ""The Long Run"" was a disappointment to some. Nevertheless, it does contain some first rate singles, including this title track (a subtle jab at rock critics, who never particularly warmed to the band), ""In the City,"" which is one of the best songs of Joe Walsh's career, the ballad ""I Can't Tell You Why,"" and the memorable ""Heartache Tonight."" It's true that the rest is mostly filler material, but that's true of all Eagles albums beyond the singles and ""The Sad Cafe"" is actually kind of moving.Overall, an unveven but decent swan song album from a band that defined the 1970s about as well as any other."
2,Decent Singles but unfocused,"The Long Run should've been the Eagles largest album to exit the 70's with, but it sort of falls short of it's goal. The album is not a very cohesive and it arrived 3 years after it's predacessor, Hotel California.Regardless, The Long Run's spawned 4 huge hit. The Eagles were always a better singles band. I'm not sure why the Eagles struggled to record this album but it likely was about discrepency in money."
1,Music is 5 star but remastering job a farce at ZERO stars,"Let me start by saying that I have known this recording intimately since it was first released. I still have a mint LP copy and the first release of this on CD from 1984 (solid puuple Elektra silkscreen CD label). So like any audio enthusiast I bought this ""remastered"" edition (I also bought the Dec 2005 remastered Japan version in the mini-LP...read that review as well). In a word: disappointment.Credit Bill Szmyczyk for creating a great (if somewhat muffled...and maybe that was the intent) recording to begin with. The ONLY thing this new incarnation brings to the table is a much louder volume. There is NO sonic revelation, there is NOT a replication of the original complete artwork, there is NO indication on the actual inserts that this is a remastered edition. The only indication is a black sticker on the shrinkwrap. So if you have any of the CD versions out there, DO NOT PITCH THEM TO BUY THIS ONE...you will be disappointed."
3,Not Hotel California Part 2,"Took a long time to come out and the results were mixed. More cynical rock from the guys who did it best back then. However, there is no standout cut on this album (Hotel California consisted of almost ALL standouts). This was their last effort before that live album they did a few years ago. However, judging by the quality of this album and subsequent solo works, it is difficult to see what all of the fuss was surrounding the breakup."
1,A Sad Ending for Eagles,"I picked this album up, expecting the same level of quality as past Eagles albums (such as the thrilling Desperado), however, it seems the only quality songs on this album are the hits, which can be just as easily obtained by purchasing the Hits Volume II, a much better album. The rest of the album is lame and uninspired, and is ultimately not worth your money."
1,Bad buy,"I should have known better at the price offered. Ad said ""like new""--- maybe if I'd asked for one that had been used as a spatula first- Scratches and skipping from the start. Bad deal all around..."
4,The Long Run,"The Long Run being their 1979 release and their sixth studio album contained such hits as ""Heartache Tonight"", ""I Can't Tell You Why"" and ""The Long Run"". The cover is very nice and classic with just the name of the band and the title on a black background. We get all the lyrics in a very easy to read font. 4/5."
4,Makes more sense in the light of history...,"I love this album. Always have. Granted, it was tough to follow up Hotel California, but this album is good -- if you really digest it in the context of history. The Eagles always represented that 'Southern California desert' kind of sound -- acoustic guitars and tight harmonies that carry you away -- but they really took a turn with this one.They sing about city life, about pimps and players, Hollywood, Greeks (in the fraternity sense) and other cultural oddities of a band that had achieved large scale success. Keep this in mind as you listen to the album. It's darker, bleaker and more cynical than their earlier works but it is good. Just don't listen to it with the 'this doesn't sound like the Eagles' frame of mind."
2,The magic was fading,"The Eagles were itching to move on with their solo careers, and that is quite visible from this album. It seems like a pile of songs just thrown together without too much thought. There are some real disappointments on this album such as 'These Shoes' (incredibly boring), and 'Greeks dont want no freaks'. 'In the City' is okay but perhaps misplaced. The album's highlights include 'I Can't Tell you Why' and 'King of Hollywood'. Naturally it is hard to follow up a masterpiece such as 'Hotel California'. The fact that I hardly play this album anymore proves that."
4,Very Good but somewhat uneven,"This difference between this album and all the others is that it actually contains some really bad songs. If you were to take the best songs from every Eagles album and compare them, only Hotel California would be stronger than The Long Run. But of course, there are 10 songs on the album. I Can't Tell You Why and Heartache Tonight are the best songs on the album. Schmitt did a helluva a job replacing Randy Meisner. His bass, vocals and vocal harmony are every bit as good as Meisner's. The Sad Cafe, In The City and the title track are all also excellent songs. The King of Hollywood is a dark and good song, but it is no Hotel California, for sure. The rest is crap. The Disco Strangler is the worst Eagles song by a mile and the only Teenage Jail even rates ""filler"" status. Still, this is a very enjoyable album, even if it is probably the worst single their debut album."
4,Polarised Fans except this loyal one,"The Long Run is one of the Eagles finest albums showing excellent musicianship. Technically superior with a lot of great stories, King of Hollywood, Sad Cafe etc this is a very good album which demonstrates the completion of the evolution away from Country Rock, the impact of Joe Walsh and that Tim Schmit is one of the most beautiful singers in this genre. Sad Cafe sounds like it could have come off any of the previous two albums. Much maligned tracks Teenage Jail and The Greeks dont want no Freaks for me are enjoyable, the guitar / synth solo at the end of Teenage Jail and the tongu in cheek lyric of Greeks are highlights. Disco Strangler is a study in accuracy and In the City is a great Walsh rocker with superb harmonies and great slide. All in all a fantastic album and one which dominates my stereo more than any of the other studio albums including Hotel California."
3,earlier stuff better,"although not as good as previous albums, the long run is a decent album.released in 1979,the long run was the eagles last studio album.it has a few good tracks.""king of hollywood"",""hearthache tonight"" and ""i cant tell you why"" stand out as the albums best songs.their earlier stuff is much better though."
2,Eagles worst album,"For an album that took so long to make, The Long Run is a lousy album, easily the Eagles worst. There are some quality songs here like In The City, I Can't Tell You Why and the Long Run, but most of the songs are throwaways. There are some particularly bad songs such as The King of Hollywood, The Greeks Don't Want No Freaks, and Teenage Jail. Not what I'd call a good reflection on the music of the Eagles. If you've just dicovered this fabulous band and are looking to hear Eagles material, look to On the Border or Hotel California."
2,COMES UP SHORT,"Timothy B. Schmidts' ""I Can't Tell You Why"" justies the two stars for this album. Most of the songs are in the mediocre to poor range. You don't get the feeling that they were trying something new after Hotel California, you just get the feeling that they weren't trying. There's just not a whole lot to like and ""Disco Strangler"" and ""The Greeks Don't Want No Freaks"" are as bad as their titles suggest. ""Heartache Tonight"" was a big hit during its original release so if that's your cup of tea this might be worth investing in. I like their other albums and I love the ""When Hell Freezes Over"" DVD, but this album is only for hardcore Eagles fans."
5,An Eagles classic!!!,"This album is a Eagles classic!!! A staple of FM radio!!! With classics tunes like: Heartache Tonight,I Can't Tell You Why,The Long Run,Those Shoes(dig that voice-box guitar!),In The City,and The Sad Cafe you can't go wrong!!! Awesome!!! Two thumbs up!!! Five stars!!! A+"
5,A Great Sackett book,"Another book in the great sackett series! Not only is this book great for the story of Echo SAckett and her traveling adventures, but it also provides a link between the books on the foundation of the Sackett family and their later exploits further west. A great read as are all of the sackett series,"
4,Ride the River,The book Doesn't lack for action and it is a well written book. The one thing they could of done to make it better than it is. Was have men or a man do the male readings for the book. Miss Rose did a very good job with the female parts but was lacking when it came to the male parts in the book.
3,Not trying to diss a woman hero...but,"This one is, in my opinion, probably the weakest Sackett story so far. I admitt I am new to Louis Lamour (relatively). I have read 9 of his books so far and I enjoy them very much and continue to read more. The Sackett series are a special lot but I was not overly excited about this particular one. It is worth reading, I guess, like any other Louis Lamour, but I would put this one off because there are many more exciting ones than this.Still a Lamour fan"
2,Unrealistic,"Entertaining but unrealistic for a 16 year girl to be able to do as much as Echo Sacket: ride, shoot, fight, lead a team, shoot a bird out of mid air with a rifle and etc. Nor does the book relate the psychological effects of a 16 year old girl killing a man. Don't waste your time."
5,Another great read by lamour,"A good story. With a new, to me, character in echo Sackett and generally good flow as usual with LAMOUR."
5,Louis L'Amour Novels Rule!,"Ride the River -Decided to read all the Sacketts novels in chronological order. (Googled it and found that there is a sequence in which these should be read, not based on when they were written and published.)Enjoying it immensely!"
5,Another Sackett Saga,This was an audiobook gift for my 94 year old mother who loves the Louis L'Amour books about the Sacketts! She loved it!
5,An out-of-the-blue classic.,"It's hard to believe with the benefit of afterthought that Michael Jackson's solo career took such a long time to take off, namely a good part of a decade. But when it did, it rose into unprecedented heights both commercially and artistically.Jackson at this point had not yet evolved into the strange, shrieking vocal imp of his post-Bad era, and his singing on this record is remarkable, a sexy yet wholesome, soulful yet understated delivery capable of many shadings. The falsetto of ""Don't Stop 'til You Get Enough"" is almost like Prince; ""Off the Wall""'s brooding beat is irresistible; ""Rock with You"" is dreamily romantic and gorgeously sung; and ""Working Day and Night"" is a breathless rush, classic dance music. Then there's the celebrated balladeering of ""She's Out of My Life"", which remains one of Jackson's best ballads to this date, a mode that he lost touch with starting with Dangerous.Michael Jackson may be behind the times now, but back in 1979, he was way ahead."
5,Where is All Started!!!,"THIS ALBUM was where it all began for Michael Jackson's Solo Career, and is one Album that EVERYONE shout have!"
2,Not the same CD showed in Picture,"The insert is not the same insert that is advertised in the CD description. I did not recieve the origional ""Off the Wall"" CD. Very dissapointed."
5,One of My favorite CD's of All Times!!!,"Although I was born 8 years after this CD came out. Michael Jackson's Off the Wall is one CD I recommended to younger crowd. However, my favorite song of all is ""Get on the Floor."" Every time I play this song I always get up and groove. The only one song I don't like on this album is ""She's out of My Life."" Every time I hear this song I begin to roll my eyes. Although Michael Jackson doesn't look me any more and always in the media. I always love him and his music!!"
5,CLASSIC MICHAEL,"When Michael Jackson put out ""Off The Wall"" in 1979, it was the beginning of the legend that dreams are made of. This year marks the 20th anniversary of this album. Hard to believe, huh? A great CD of hits like ""Don't Stop Till You Get Enough,"" ""Rock With You,"" ""Working Day And Night,"" ""She's Out Of My Life,"" and more. His first dance (or should I say ""disco"") record is a representation of what an artist expresses in his music, and this was before that ""Thriller"" album came out in 1982. Overall, solid as a rock. I recommend that you play this during the summer season. All the songs are ""HOT!"""
5,amazing album,I love playing this back to back with Diana Ross's Diana album. Both are great classics that still sound fresh today. Off the wall doesn't disappoint at all melodically. It's hard not to singalong to this CD and get dancing. I would also recommend getting the jacksons destiny and triumph and playing them alongside this CD in order to hear michael's growth as a creative artist.
5,More than the King of Pop,"I will forever love all the songs from the ""The Off the Wall"" album. I had the OTW LP, Tape Cassette, and am now purchasing the CD.Rest in PEACE MJ."
3,"Great Music, Poor quality technology","I love Michael Jackson and this album; however, I ordered the CD so I could skip to some of my favorite songs. Unfortunately, this CD doesn't let you skip from track to track. You have to fast forward through it like a casette tape..."
5,Off the Wall,"If you appreciate great music then you must have a copy of this CD. This CD is a special edition ( remastered version of the original album). It also contains eighteen minutes of Michael's original demo recording (bonus tracks) of ""Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough' and ""Workin' Day And Night."" There is more on this CD.... Quincy Jones, Rod Temperton.....You have to buy this CD!"
5,Musical Artistry At It's Best,"What can I say about MJ's Off The Wall?! The music is amazing. Michael's voice is amazing. I can say no more but EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT!"
4,Wrong pics for album,"I have not been a fan of Michael Jackson since I was a teenager. However, with his recent passing I have been playing catch up with up with what has transpired in his life up until his death. ""Rock with you"" was the first record I bought when I was twelve. My mom bought the album. I remember just admiring Micheal's beautiful smile. My exact word was ""wow"" as I held the album cover in my hands. I wanted to have the same feeling again when I received my CD of ""Off the wall."" What a disappointment. The cd has quite a few photos of Michael with a Jheri curl, not his textured fro and no smile. I wanted the CD just for cover pic of his smiling face.The sound is good on the cd. I enjoyed listening to the narration.Maybe I'll have to order an ""off the wall"" poster to see Micheal's beautiful illuminating smile from his brown face."
3,music great but commentaries are not necessary,if i had known how much of this classic jackson album was commentary i would have purchase the regular album. it takes up a lot of space and once you have heard it - well once is enough. i will have to purchase a new CD for just the music. oh well.
5,So what's so wrong with disco?,"Okay, I know that there's still a bit of camp inherent in admitting that you like disco - and I don't, as a rule, but this album transcends all that; I feel no shame in admitting that this is one of the best ""pop"" records ever made. If you allow certain trappings of the period to cause you to dismiss songs as great as ""Rock With You,"" ""I Can't Help It,"" or the title track, it's definitely your loss. And, allow me to say that Jackson's performances on this album constitute some of the most assured, rhythmically infectious vocal work this side of James Brown. Chalk me up as one who believes that Michael Jackson will never make a better album than this one."
3,an interesting stroll down memory lane,"Well, hmmm. I finally decided to get this CD because I got tired of playing the LP and explaining to my kids that an LP is not a ""big CD"". This CD has been re-packaged. You don't see the original Michael face, you get what appears to be his next face and nose, off the ""Thriller"" album. You also get some ""bonus"" extra tracks. If you're a die-hard Michael fan I suppose these are nice, but I want to listen to the music, not listen to Quincy Jones talk about this album. Listening to the Jackson kids' demos are kind of fun -- once. Complaints aside the music is what I bought the CD for and of course the music doesn't disappoint. Just skip those last ""bonus"" tracks."
5,Thank you Michael...Love and light to your Spirit!!!,"Michael's spirit lives on through the vast musical legacy he created for us. There is something for everyone, beginning with the Jackson 5 years. I refuse to entertain the personal issues...that is done. He LIVED the consequences of bad choices which includes having the vultures around him ""advising"" him. I cannot imagine what it was like to live his path...living with such infinite talent yet feeling so lonely and depressed. I was always a fan though even when it wasn't cool and forever more will be. Now it's time to celebrate the AMAZING, genius he was. Off The Wall will help you do just that. Freshman year of college, I wrote an analysis of this album and earned an A+. It's just that good, the entire album. Reasearch has proven music heals the soul. Peace and healing to his children, parents, siblings and those of us who love him."
4,This one started his mega star rise...,You could already tell that this dude was gonna be BIG. No one I don't think could havepredicted that he would become the supersonic megastar that he did become.But from this project you surely could tell that he belonged out front.Very enjoyable look back at the starting point from a solo point of view for a manwho would become a music legend!
5,This Is Indisputedly His Masterpiece!!!,"Thriller was an excellent record too but received a boost of sorts from the then fledgling MTV. This record though made it Completely on its own merits and thus deserves a five star rating for the artistic, musician and showmanship triumph it obtained."
4,The Maturation of The King of Pop,"Michael Jackson was a big child star with the Jackson Five. He even had a couple of hits as a solo artist in his youth. However, with the release of Off The Wall, Michael matured not only as a man but as a recording artist with a fine collection of songs. There are a variety of textures from the slow evocative She's Out Of My Life to the percussion dance number Don't Stop Till You Get Enough. Rock With You, Its The Falling In Love, and Off The Wall are three smooth dance numbers which will bring out the romantic in almost. Burn This Disco Out will get you booging onto the floor. Not quite on the level of Thriller but surely very close. Soul/R&B fans should have this and others should give it a try. Its a leading seller of its era for good reason."
2,Special Edition Problems in the Remastering (Treble Boost),"Why am I giving this Michael Jackson masterpiece only two stars? I have a serious issue with the remastering -- it's way too bright on my high-end (and otherwise very flat with no tone controls) stereo system. Who the heck maintained the boosted treble? I'm sure this would sound great equalized on an AM radio station, but it's hurting my ears. The sound quality of the original album is remarkably crisp...stinging, in fact.So, this is just a warning for those expecting the remastering to have corrected the riding-the-treble-gain problem. I recommend those without the usual treble/bass tone controls who still have their hearing avoid this particular release."
3,MJ OFF the Wall CD,"for my money, this was MJ's BEST ALBUM EVER....seemed to me after THRILLER, he lost his perspective of what normal behaviour is and isn't.This purchase was a replacement CD, and this CD was also from my college years at the BYU in Utah."
2,It's An Okay Album,"I'm Not Really Fond Of Off The Wall. To Me, The Only Good Songs Are Rock With You, Girlfriend, And She's Out Of My Life. The Other Songs Are Just Bad, But Maybe I Think This Because I Listen To Mainly Rock. But This Is A Gem To Disco And Pop Fans.Also, Chart PeaksOff The Wall (Album) #1 US & UKDon't Stop Til' You Get Enough #1 US & UKRock With You #1 US #3 UKOff The Wall (Song) #10 US #7 UKShe's Out Of My Life #10 US #3 UKGirlfriend (Yes Girlfriend Was A Single) #41 UKWorking Day And Night Did'nt Chart (Probably Due To A Limited Release)"
4,4 1/2 stars,"The bass line kicks it off, Michael doin his lil rap...and then the melody kicks up...instantly you get caught up in the tornado of rhythm and Michael's voice, and you dont land till the albums over. ""Dont Stop Till You Get Enough"", classic dance track, full to the brim of funk and soul with a danceable flow. ""Rock With You"" a mid tempo groove fest. A heavy heavy album. Establishing Michael as an accomplished artist without his brothers behind him. Just a totally fun record about dancing and romancing, usually i like a little bit more depth, but the way Michael pulled it off; I couldnt resist. Make sure not to miss this overlooked Michael album...this album shows him at his Zen along with Thriller."
5,this CD is tha bomb,"so smooth, so melodic and so soulful! People aren't lying when they say mike was at his best then. Although he went on to create more and more great CD's this was the start of them all and the most fresh and timeless which set in stone mj's legendary music status."
4,Michael Jackson Off The Wall,What a album. Even fore his first solo. I think it is great. No one can make music like Michael J. Jackson. He is truleu the King of Pop. That should never change. I have been a fan ever sence I was really little. I still am today. So try this album if you do not have it yet. Even a non Michael Fan should like this album.
4,"Not a ""Thriller""","Certainly not thiller, but better than most albums released today. Best tracks includes Off The Wall, I Can't Help It and Rock With You. Only track that misses for me is Burn This Disco Out."
1,Terrible,This album was putrid. Don't know why this guy is so popular. Even Englebert Humberdink and Tiny Tim are better.
3,it has bad sound quality,"I got this from the company when I worked there, I opened it and I played it and the sound was so bad I took it out and I lost the CD itself. I kept the case because I have a copy thats missing the case, so its worth buying if u have an old one missing the case."
4,"Best in its class, remastered","This 2004 set is a remastered and the best version of the 1992 original. It has a qood quality video, sound, and menu structure."
4,Good techniques to incorporate to your style.,"I was surprised to see how 64 pages could be filled wth lots of valuable information. All of which are short and to the point. In the clay section he offers two different clay recipes for each type of clay discribed. In the project section, each project is throughly explained with ""how to"" photographs. Most of the projects are worth the time doing since the techniques can be incorporated into the potters style."
3,Great Photos-Projects are a little too artsy,"I am just beginning to explore clay and so I got this book for myself and for the students in my store who take classes. The techniques are illustrated very well. The directions very clear and photos are great. The only complaint I have is that the projects are a bit out there for me. I mean I'd like to build a great mug, a plate, maybe some platters or something, but some of the wild sculptures are not for me."
3,Useful aid to handbuilding potters with a different approach,"This short, 63 page book offers original and interesting lessons to potters. The author selecs original approaches, such as showing how to build a cup or vase from small strips or balls of clay only, he teaches how to cleverly use the coil technique, and his sculpted rhino as well as his geometric and abstract structures are magnificent. It is a specialized book; it is useful and enriching, in my opinion, to potters with some experience in handbulding."
1,Just Awful... seriously.,"This book is TERRIBLE. Seriously, bad. If I had bought this book new, I would be returning it right now. The projects inside look like they should be for a five year old. It barely brushes on technique, and those that it does cover look dreadful. Don't waste your money on this book, there are so many better ones available."
2,kiddy book,"this book has some cute ideas but alot of them are impractical such as covering school folders with astroturf and pompoms, lining locker walls with fur, or wearing eiffel tower keychains as earrings"
2,2 Stars,"David Banner is a great producer but he is no rap artist. MTA2 has some content, but is mostly trash. NOT RECOMMENDED."
4,Good CD,"I think this cd is a little better than Mississippi and has more guest appearances on it, but less ammount of songs.There were two interludes on here but both were dumb after a while, and just take up space.My favorite songs are Like A Pimp, Crank It Up, Eternal, Mamas House, and Air Force Ones.I suggest you buy this album for those songs only."
1,the new voice-overs are depressing.,"If you watched and loved this movie as a kid, do not(!) buy this disney version. I just bought it & I can't even watch it all the way through. It is definately worth it to try to track down the fox family version."
1,DUBBED BY DAKOTA AND ELLE FANNING,"This version sucks, the character voices are dubbed by different people than the original, sounds terrible. you gotta get the other one, with the different cover picture."
1,WONDERFUL FILM RUINED BY DISNEY,This Christmas I thought I'd surprise both my daughters with a DVD version of a film they grew up loving - truly loving! All three of us were nothing less then devastated by Disney's new sound track - for all intents and purposes it is not the same film at all. The opening song is different and worse. The new voice overs absolutely take away every aspect of the film that we love so dearly. FOR THOSE PEOPLE WHO NEVER SAW THE ORIGINAL VERSION - please take the time to seek out a copy and see for yourselves how much better it is!! DISNEY - SHAME ON YOU!!
1,New Dub Un-Listenable,"I have to agree with just about every other reviewer of this DVD. My brothers and I grew up watching the original Totoro dub by Fox and we still love and enjoy it. However when we watched the new Disney dub none of us could sit through it, the voice cast was extremly uninspired and monotone--only the two parent voice overs Lea Solanga and Tim Daly did an admirable job. It is really unfortunate that Disney could not improve on the original."
2,Can't get past the new voice actors.,"This review is for the disney (re-dubbed) version. The movie itself is and always will be a five star film for me. This version though left me really cold.Totoro was my favorite movie growing up. I have seen it literally more than any other movie, and I know it almost line for line. So it was really disconcerting to watch this version. It's just... wrong. I suppose that they didn't do a BAD job dubbing it, but its just not the same. My boyfriend got this for me as a gift and did not know about the change, so it was just really disapointing. I'm going to have to spring for the original version one of these days. :-/"
3,Disney version not as good as older version,New DVD by Disney has new voices and wording for the characters. We were used to the older voices and the colloquial wording. Sad to see the change.
1,what happened!?!,"I grew up watching this movie in several formats. Starting with the original Japanese tapes followed by the American tapes and finally both versions of the American DVD. I loved them all until this one.what happened?!!! The first dub was amazing, full of genuine feelings and portrayals, with a very close translation! This new version is just trash in comparison. watch them side by side and you will see how much it's been ripped apart. The only reason I would buy this set would be for the Japanese version, I don't care how ""lively"" Dakota fanning and her sister are, they are not suited for this.If you can find the original dub, buy it; it still has all the magic that makes this movie what it is. It's an amazing movie, just a terrible DVD."
3,"Well, Disney Screwed This Up","I first saw Totoro with the English subtitles in the what I now know is the Fox version about 8 years ago and loved it. I was tired and saw the dvd on the shelf and got excited and didn't look closely. At home I popped it in and the most appallingly crass sounding voice came out of Satsuki then Mei. It's nice that I have now have the Japanese version, but my daughter doesn't understand Japanese. I'm hunting down the Fox."
5,AAAAAAA++++,This is a great movie. My hole family loves this movie. It is great start to end. I say go and buy it today your kids will enjoy it.
4,So cute!!!!,I love that they used real sisters for dubbing Satsuki & Mei Kusakabe ( Dakota & Elle Fanning ). It made it all the more real. Miyazaki is a genius and I love his movies.
1,Not a version I could recommend,"I'm afraid I could never recommend the Disney release of this film.After seeing an earlier release before the girls' parts were rendered by the Fanning sisters, my wife and I found _their_ rendering VERY disappointing.I'm afraid we both believe the characters were not at all captured well and the Fannings' rendering simply ruined Totoro for us.Fortunately, although I had already given away an earlier copy, I was able to find another through Amazon's third party offerings.If you can obtain the older version: DO SO!!!"
3,Stunning film but poor mastering............,"I saw this for the first time recently, what a warm and truly wonderful film. But when I went to find it on DVD I was appalled to find it only in pan-and-scan(!)I'm shaking my head that the studio feels they need to dumb down the format to appeal to preschoolers and their babysitters. I can hear the Totoro crying as I write...So what did I do? I went to Ebay and found the all-region Japanese pressing, in letterbox, with both English and Japanese audio. Don't encourage the studios by buying their full-screen monstrosities (sorry Amazon)."
1,Beware of this version,"As promised, this DVD contains contents that exactly match the previous VHS release by this studio; namely Pan & Scan only, English dub only, no extras. The film is wonderful, and surely deserves to be presented as Miyazaki intended it to be seen, not cut up. Those of us who want to see that will be disappointed with this disk."
2,2 stars for the DVD of a 5-star film,"My short review is not about the film itself (which is absolutely brilliant and highly recommended), but about this DVD:Please be aware that:1) The DVD has been transferred from video and not from the original film, and thus lacks the possible DVD-quality (when played one picture at the time the video-source becomes perfectly clear, rendering fuzzy and double pictures)2) The dubbing is ENGLISH and there is NO option for to play the original Japanese, nor are there any subtitles (not even for the hard of hearing).3) There are NO extras whatsoever.This should not discourage parents to buy this DVD as an excellent film for their (English speaking) children, but animation film lovers who buy this DVD will be utterly dissapointed that they cannot enjoy this film in its original glory (at least I was)."
1,Also Very Disappointed,"I agree with the reviewer below. I was holding out on purchasing this film on VHS, wanting it on DVD instead. I was excited when Amazon.com alerted me to this release. I expected it to be the same as the marvelous 2DVD, Region 2 release with full-screen presentation, bi-lingual audio and subtitles and an extra DVD full of special features. I was extremely disappointed in receiving this full-screen, pan-and-scan version with only an English audio voice track! No special features! The folks who released this should be ashamed. Miyazaki deserves better..."
3,"Stars are for Ghibli, not Disney!","The original English dub of this wonderful film is so far superior to the Disney dub. Dakota Fanning and her sister may be cute in other films but here, their voices are not suited to the characters. The singer gets the songs wrong (who let that happen?), the Japanese-ness of the film is missing--it's lost the charm, the warmth, the love of the original dub. Disney should not have touched this. We bought it, we started to watch it and then we turned it off. I don't expect to watch it again and will probably sell it.I would have given this film 1 star for what Disney did to it--the film as Miyzaki wrote it is a 5+. Avoid this dub if you can and find the original. It's soooo much better!"
1,Buyer beware,"I made the mistake of removing the wrapping before looking at the details on this DVD, so I can't return it even though I haven't watched it and won't. I also made the mistake of buying this without checking out the reviews. This is not the original version of the film. It's dubbed (no original audio) and equally bad, it's been violated with the completely unnecessary pan and scan. Come on, America, even on my 9-inch TV, I'd rather see a film in its original aspect ratio. This goes into my white elephant heap."
5,Totoro is.,"Totoro is one of the best animated films for not just kids, but kids-at-heart. If you haven't seen it, you are doing yourself a disservice. Don't do that."
3,No Japanese Sound?!?,"My Neighbor Totoro is a great film and a must have part of even a modest anime collection. But when I ordered this DVD, it never even crossed my mind that there wouldn't be the original language track. Japanese sound is standard on any anime DVD. Although the English dub isn't that bad, I'd still like to have the option to watch it in its original form. I feel as if I only have half of the movie. If youfre looking for the original Japanese, unfortunately you'll need to look somewhere else."
4,Nice Movie,"The video didn't arrive as soon as I thought (yesterday), and the case was cracked when it go here. However, the movie itself played without errors, so I won't be sending it back anytime soon. Gotta love that furry Totoro XD! I recommend this movie to anyone who likes Miyazaki's films."
2,Hmmmmm,Hello id like to say i was excited to see this masterpiece of a film on dvd but their is a huge drawback that destroys my love for the new versionof this film! I have the vhs version with the original english dub and its fantastic. Because they changed the voice acting in the new dvd version its extremely hard to enjoy a movie where an 4 year old has the voice that sounds like a 13 year old. It really takes away from the enjoyment of the story and charachters. Main point=Voice acting BAAAAAAAAAAAAADDDDDDD! Story=Gooooood But if you want a more memorable and enjoyable experience please do yourself a favor and buy the vhs with the original english voice acting.
1,Lost in Translation,If you are getting this as a sense of childhood nostalgia DON'T. The translation sucks and in this version they are not called dust bunnies. It made me sad the entire movie. You are better off getting it on VHS and burning a DVD copy.
3,Bought for a gift,I bought this dvd for a birthday gift and we watched it and it was very entertaining.The birthday girl was six years old. This is a very entertaining dvd for kids and adults alike.
5,Even better,"I first saw My Neighbor Totoro in its videotape version. It's a great film, and that version transmitted the greatness. This version is even better. For one thing, the breathtaking landscape backgrounds are brilliant in their intensity. Then there are the Fanning sisters. These child actresses bring an authenticity that is unparalleled. OK, Disney cheated and used real sisters. But they are also excellent actresses. Their sister-ness is seamless. The emotions are right on. They made a great film even better. I love it as much as my daughter does."
1,Fake!,"I bought this dvd thinking it was the same as the one my daughter watched 1000 times over on vhs. It wasn't. I was excited to watch this with my now 17 year old daughter and at once, we knew Disney or whoever decided to redo the dubbing rimmed it big time. It was great the way it was. Disgusted with it! I recommend the original one over this FAKE one."
5,Kids Love It,"My kids love this movie. Based upon a recommendation by someone, I went ahead and took the plunge. It's a little weird. If you google ""the meaning of My Neighbor Totoro,"" there are a lot of theories about this movie."
1,Dakota and Elle Fanning?,"I am a fan of the old 1988 version with the original english dubbing, so if you saw and enjoyed that version (the VHS version) you will be severely disappointed. They change much of the dialogue and the pronunciation of names and it is just ridiculous. Highly disappointed. The voices barely match the lips and the dialogue is so dumbed down it is hard to follow the story. If you are a Totoro fan and want the original english dubbed version, I suggest you look more closely before purchasing the DVD."
1,What a disappointment...,"I am such a big Miyazaki fan and now, such a disappointed fan since I received the latest version of Totoro in the new 2-disc dvd?? Why did Disney have to change something that was so charming and elegant in the first place. New voiceovers by Dakota Fanning and Elle Fanning aren't going to sell any more units. I'm not sure if I wanted to cry or puke when I started to play this...True Totoro fans should steer clear of this Disney make-over mess. It is the biggest video disappointment of the new millenium for me. Shoot, back to the old VHS."
3,I love the Fox version better...,"So, watching this movie I had very high expectations since I watched the Fox version first. I hoped that they wouldn't change many of the funny phrases said in the Fox version but to my surprise Disney did. The voices that were chosen didn't seem to fit to me and the boy in the movie didn't come off like this quirky kid anymore but a squeaky voiced one. If you never seen this before well I would suggest getting the Fox version. I fell in love with Totoro when I was younger around 5 and now watching it in the way Disney changed it; I'm not so happy with it. The only good thing about the Disney version is the extras and how it came about and the various sites used."
3,Leave it to Disney...,"I'd be a lot happier if the Amazon description had included data regarding the voiceover - my daughter loved this film in it's original format at a friend's house, and we decided to get it for her. Come to find out everything on the audio track was changed - this one has Dakota Fanning and her little sister doing the voices, even though Amazon's description says it has the original actoirs: Actors: Noriko Hidaka, Chika Sakamoto, Shigesato Itoi, Sumi Shimamoto, Tanie Kitabayashi. It's been throughly Disney-fied, including a dumb-down from Satsuki's father to ""remember to take off your shoes..."" Any Japanese folk find this hysterical? Still agreat show, but I'm a little disgruntled."
5,Wonderful movie for kids,"I am always looking for movies for my 2 1/2 year old to watch that are non-violent and entertaining for all of us. This movie certainly fits all of my criteria. The story is simple and absorbing and the pace is quick enough for a young viewer, but it has natural breaks in it for watching different parts on different days. The characters are very engaging and the kids actually act like real kids. It's a sweet movie that parents and young children will enjoy."
4,"This DVD edition may not do it justice, but","it is still worth having. As someone else mentionned, better this DVD than none. This is my three year old son's favorite movie. We wore out the first VHS copy we had, so we were thrilled to get a DVD. What I love about it is that the girls find the spirit world, and even though their father can't see it, he believes them, unlike typical Disney fare where the parents never believe the children until the end. I have seen this movie several times, but I never get tired of it. There is always so much to see in a Miyazaki film."
2,Wonderful Film! But DVD presentation upsetting...,"I love this film, and the english dub is actually quite good. If you have not seen the film, watch it! BUT.. I believe Fox has misjudged its audience and created a DVD that I find lacking. Sure, its animated and made mostly for children but I do not have any children and could not wait to get this DVD. I was EXTREMELY disappointed to find that there was no original Japanese language track on this DVD.I know this sounds like previous reviews but I was so disappointed about the missing Japanese track that I had to add my voice here."
5,Great DVD,This DVD was perfect for my nephews. It arrived in a timely manner and the price wasn't so bad too. I'm a satisfied customer!
4,Region 3 dvd is the way to go,Don't waste your money on the fox version. The region 3 version is widescreen and in original Japanese with english subtitles.
5,An Honor to Nature!!!,"There really isn't much to say. As with any Hayao Miyazaki movie...it is absolute magic of gorgeous animation and enchanting beautiful storytelling. ""MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO"" is definitely a movie that the whole family can and will enjoy ^_^"
5,Great,"Great, high quality in story.Not only children, but adults can also enjoy watching.My son and I watch quite a lot together."
5,It will bring you to a different world...,"The world of totoro is such a magical place. Totoro will lead you on the adventure of a life-time. Just hop on the cat-bus, and we're off!I would gladly rate it a hundred stars instead of 5, for it is infact my most favorite movie in the whole entire world. It's just sop magical..in the beautiful world of totoro...you'll always be safe.....sorry! Got sorta lost in my own world there! Well, anyway, please buy this movie! It's the best in the whole entire world! Please!"
5,Wonderfully Delightful,"No sex, no violence, no bad words. Just lots of fun for children from 2 to 60. Touching, funny, imaginative. No it's not Disney, but take a chance and buy it! You will not be disappointed. The characters are so charming. The animation is very pleasing to the very young. My 2 year old watchs it as well as my 10 year old who I purchased it for 7 years ago."
4,Better format and worst english translation,"Finally the widescreen version is available. I have my own previous dvd from FOX, 4:3 format. But what disappointment when listening the English version, lack, poor, slow, no feeling. Even the opening and ending theme are bad, extending some high voice notes.The only good things for this dvd version are:16:9 format.The soundtrack.Original Japanese language track.Subtitles (English and Japanese)For Miyazaki collectors, this dvd must be on your own dvd library.Still the old dvd version is far better on English language track.Again the Disney mafia destroyed the magic of this beautiful film. My advice is to watch this movie on Japanese language and English subtitles.Studio Ghibli = ADisney = F"
2,Not what I'm used to,"I saw this cover and immediately wanted to see it. I love Howl's Moving Castle, Ponyo and Spirited Away. But this was not of the same caliber.Don't get me wrong, the animation is lovely and the characters were adorable, but I think it was just too young for my taste. Did I mention I have a 2 year old who loves Barney, Pingu, and Caillou. She took one look at it and left the room. I left it on but found myself drifting because I was bored.Many seem to love it. Unfortunately I just couldn't get into it. If you are looking for a more mature anime I would refer to the 3 I listed above."
1,"You people are kidding, right???","Come on, one of the greatest anime movies of all time, and you people DUB it? All I can say is that the english voices can't compare to the original japanese ones. Even if you can't speak japanese, A- it's possible to buy fandubs, and B- it's possible to find translated scripts on the internet. You're not getting the full experience of this movie if you watch a version in which they remove and replace ALL the sound... just realize that, please. I'm not even going to BRING UP the topic of the music...."
4,My Neighbor Totoro,"I have this movie on VHS and recently purchased the DVD. It's a great movie except that when I recieved the DVD and watched it, it was different from the original. I noticed the voices were different from the original, and dialoge was changed. I was very disappointed because the original was so much more exciting and so much more fun. It was more dramatic in the original than in this Version of Totoro. So if your looking for the original, this isn't it. Voices were played by recent actors such as Dakota fanning and others, which were not the voices of the original."
4,My Neighbor Totoro,"I watched it, and I think it's good. It can be a little kiddish, but everyone would probably be happy with it."
3,Not the same version!,"I grew up watching a recorded tv version of the movie Totoro. In that version, the voices were spoken in English by actual oriental people, and I have to say, the dialogue was much better and funnier. I was extremely disappointed while watching this version beacuse all the dialogue was completely different, and it even looks like some of the charaters were changed to look more American. Also the music is different and the graphics are duller. We purchased this DVD version when our VHS version broke I was all around very unhappy with this version, and do not reccomend it to anyone who has seen the version I have."
1,The 'Fanning corn children' redub ruins this for me.,Disney always takes a good thing and poops all over it. The Fox release of this movie has the more tolerable English language dub.
2,"show is great, Miyazaki is great! but the dvd was lacking.","This dvd is not subtitled. it is only english dubbed. the original voices & music have been changed and remade, without offering the Japanese w/ Subtitles that can normally be had on anime DVD.DVD is supposed to havefeatures and enhancements above regular vhs, this does not have that."
5,A Funny Movie for All Ages,"Totoro has got to be my favorite ""family"" movie to watch. Even though i am an adult now, and i watched the movie frequently when i was a child, i still love watching the movie when ever i get the chance of free time. Its a great movie and i highly recommend it to kids and adults of all ages."
4,My neighbor Totoro,This is a very nice movie to see with all the family. I purchased that movie for Xmas for my son & enjoyed because he was watching that movie when he was a kid and now as a teen he still enjoy to watch that movie
2,"If you're looking for original voices, get a different copy","There's nothing the matter with this edition if you're not attached to the original version. I just wished I would've looked more closely because this was a huge disappointment in our family. My kids insisted at the opening credits it wasn't the same and the differences of detail, voice (accent!)and music just became distracting. What was supposed to be a great nostalgic event turned into a downer, even if you tried to separate the two and appreciate this one on its own merits."
2,What the hell disney?,"This was my favorite movie of all time when i was a little kid. Since those Disney has taken the movie and completely screwed it by re-doing the voices. If you're a true fan of the original, then do not buy this movie. It is the disney version. And if you know where i can get the original (non-disney) version i would appreciate it if you let me know."
5,Totoro DVD,"My six-year old twin granddaughters love this DVD so much they wanted a second copy at our house. As could find only 18 left at Amazon as DVD is now out of print and unavailable elsewhere, purchased a collector's edition."
2,O.K. but not the best translation,"We'd rented a different version of this movie at the library and had enjoyed the translation of the movie and the voices and language used. My kids and I were disappointed by the ""disney-fication"" of the version we purchased. A lot of the dialogue had been substantially changed, or dumbed down, and the movie lost a lot of its original charm."
5,Gets me through a sick-at-home day!,"This is a beautifully produced anime that I find completely entertaining and charming. I am an artist and the artistry displayed in the scenery is breathtaking. The story is sweet, and I'm sorry some of the reviewers find it slow. It has a nice, easy pace. I love Totoro and his friends!"
4,"Better than the Disney dub, but missing some important stuff","The voices and sound effects are better than the modern Disney dub (those Fanning kids just make my ears bleed with their accents, it doesn't make sense!), and thus I recommend the 20th Century Fox english dub over the Disney one. A side note, Totoro's voice was changed from the original Miyazaki film, but in my opinion it's better as it sounds more like a creature than just a guy moaning into a mic.Because the DVD lacks the extras, Japanese audio track and crisp film quality one would expect from an imported foreign film DVD, it loses a star and a half. ***1/2 of 5Of course, the film itself gets a 5 out of 5 ^_^"
5,Really special,"This specific movie was for one of my co-workers who has been trying to get this movie for quite a while. When I saw it on your web site, I was so pleased & so was she. She really admires Mr. Hidaka's works."
5,Best. Animation. Ever.,"This movie is by far the best animated movie ever, and the most magical as well. You cannot explain any of the Studio Ghibli films to anyone as well as they can see it. You can be any age to get enjoyment out of this movie. Enter the world of two Japenese little children, Satsuki and Mei. Of the two, Mei is slightly more curious. But that's not stopping Satsuki. Satsuki is almost as curious as Mei, and older by a few years. One day while Satsuki is at home, something magical happens in their forest. Mei finds ""Totoro,"" the ""guardian"" of the forest. While this movie may seem a little overrated, it only seems that way until you see it."
4,Wait for the new release,"The DVD version available right now is from Fox. It's a pan & scan version and contains no extras. While the movie itself is wonderful, hold off buying this edition. On August 31, 2004 it will be re-released as a 2-disc set like the other Miyazaki movies (Spirited Away, Kiki, Castle In The Sky). It will have an all-new English language cast, widescreen presentation and a second disc of bonus features. Two other films will be released the same day - Porco Rosso and Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind. I know I'll be replacing my Fox p& s version of Totoro then."
2,"good movie, bad DVD","When I saw the US premiere of Spirited Away I was thrilled to hear the Gibli studio representative tell us that all of Miyazaki's movies would be released in the US within the next two years.Disney studios (since they apparently feel the need to control all feature length animation in the US) was to handle the distribution. Apparently, like the fable goes, once they had it they didn't want it anymore and sold it to Fox to do with what they would.What they have done, and this won't be news if you've read some of the other reviews here, is to release a very inexpensive product, but you get what you pay for.Specifically, pan and scan instead of widescreen and English dub only.If you are looking for a nice movie for children, and you are not familiar with Miyazaki's work, this version should be OK.To most adults my advice is to get yourself to your nearest search engine and find yourself a widescreen version with a Japanese soundtrack and English subtitles."
1,"Great Film, HORRIBLE DVD","Unfortunately, this DVD is a poor-quality pan-and-scan release. Needs to be indicated on the product description."
2,"Wonderful Movie, poor DVD","I must concur with the other reviewers of this DVD... I love this movies, and indeed bought a DVD player that could play the Original Japanese DVD release. This 'Fox' release is a poor substitute for the original film. In specific this production is Pan & Scan, and while you might be able to follow the plot, the beauty of the Miyazaki film is lost. Indeed the trimming of the picture often makes the color composition off. Also the DVD seems to be a bit over saturated, and a little off to the red side. Other basic things lacking: captions (of any form - even English!), other languages (Spanish, French would have been nice - this is a region 1 DVD after all, likewise it would have been nice to have the Japanese - some kids out there are learning this language), and indeed any extras. Given all of this the DVD is quite poor, but the story is wonderful... So get the best copy you can afford and enjoy."
2,"Animee masterpiece...Terrible DVD, buy the video.","I couldn't wait for My Neighbor Totoro to be released on DVD. When I finally received the DVD, what a disappointment. Its full screen (pan&scan) and the audio is sub par. Fox rushed this out only to capitalize off of Spirited Away's success. Its basically the Videotape edition transfered to disc. Anyone who appreciates the advantages of viewing DVDs and the artistic genius of Miyazaki will be greatly let down. Disney has done a beautiful job on Spirited Away, Kiki's Delivery Service and Castle in the Sky. I only hope Fox will rerelease a better edition of this masterpiece."
2,Great movie; but don't buy it (yet)!,"This is one of the most heartwarming films of director Hayao Miyazaki's collection. I have seen practically all of Miyazaki's movies, and I love every one of them. I'd highly recommend this movie to anyone. However, if you want to experience this movie as it was intended to be seen, please wait for a better DVD release. This DVD, by Fox, is missing the Japanese language track (in order to watch it subtitled), and it is full-screen only, meaning the image has been cropped. Disney is set to re-release this movie, perhaps in 2005, so do yourself a favor and wait until then. In the meantime, there's nothing wrong with renting this version of Totoro!"
5,Wonderful story,"Anyone would love this story. The music is great, too. I wish DVD will come out soon."
2,Wonderful Film! But DVD presentation upsetting...,"I love this film, and the english dub is actually quite good. If you have not seen the film, watch it! BUT.. I believe Fox has misjudged its audience and created a DVD that I find lacking. Sure, its animated and made for children but I'm in my mid 20's and do not have any children and could not wait to get this DVD. I was EXTREMELY disappointed to find that there was no original Japanese language track on this DVD.I know this sounds like previous reviews but I was so disappointed about the missing Japanese track that I had to add my voice here."
3,Great Movie--why did they re-dub it??,"Buyer beware, as they say. Please read this and other reviews before you buy MNT. Thank goodness I rented this version before I went to buy it today. I have to agree with the April 8 review. My kids sat down to watch it with me and said, ""What have they done to the voices?"". We couldn't believe it. Disney has gotten hold of it, and for some reason, felt they had to change it to re-package it, and put well-known Hollywood actors' voices to it. What a mistake. Thanks to the reviews here, I went and bought the original Fox version, although it costs about 1/3 more. It's worth it, even without a ""bonus"" disc, which frankly isn't much of a bonus."
5,JUST WATCH IT ALREADY!,"This is by far my favorite anime. I cannot recommend this movie enough. Letting your kids fall in love with a well known anime character, Totoro, can be more unique than being obsessed with Hannah Montana. Aside from that, this movie is perfect for a family movie night and people of all ages will enjoy its charm. Just to warn you, the mother does have an illness, possibly cancer, so if that may upset your children I would wait a few years. Other than that the movie is adorable, flawless, beautiful (the art), and a must watch. To be honest after my family and I watched this we ordered the DVD and a Totoro plush!My Neighbor Totoro (Two-Disc Special Edition)"
5,My Neighbor Totoro is the best movie for little kids,My two year old daughter LOVES this movie. Satsuki and Mei are two adorable little girls in Japan and they meet Totoro. He is a forest spirit that helps the little girls on their journeys. I think it's nice to expose little kids to different cultures. She asks for this movie over and over and I don't mind watching it with her.
2,Horrible Disney version. Voices dubbed over.,"There's not much to say other than Disney rubbing their hands all over this one.The original DVD and VHS tapes had better and more talented voice overs than this Disney version. In particular the little girl, Mei. Also the title song vocals have been redone. (I guess Disney felt they could get a better singer)It looses a lot of the ""feel"" of the original DVD and VHS tapes. I have to rate this very low as I was very disappointed and expected to find the original version intact when I bought it. I have not used this DVD at all and have not even bothered selling it. Simply forgot about it.Again, HORRIBLE job on the voice dubs otherwise the movie itself has been left intact."
5,It was exactly as I wanted,Love it. It was exactly as I wanted and expected. Could not be happier. I'll enjoy this for a long time.
4,Not the Original English Dub Version,"I love, love, love the original English dub but this will do. The dialog is just a tiny bit different from the original but I didn't want to spend $60 for it. If you are a true die-hard fan of the original, you might be disappointed."
1,item never received,"My review about this product is that i never received the dvd. I can say I was very excited about getting this movie for my daughter, but it never came. I sent 2 emails to Supermart/Monstermart. No replies. No resolution.I know this is a very cute movie because i loved it when i first saw it years ago."
2,Not original,"I haven't watched this yet, but my wife said this is not the one she had expected. This is not an original version."
1,Zero Stars for this DVD,"Since Disney has foolishly decided not to releasethis DVD, I give it zero stars."
3,"Good, but not great like the others.","Almost everyone I knew into animation told me I'd love this movie after I got into Studio Gibli's work a few years back. I guess after seeing Princess Mononoke, Howl's Moving Castle and Spirited Away anything would have a hard time stacking up. It's a good movie, but I don't think they used the magical elements and creatures enough."
1,Sucked,"I love My Neighbor Totoro, but this one that disney put out really sucked, They changed the voices, took out a lot of lines, and just all around messed it up. i have the orginal tape that streamline put out back in the early 90's and have pretty much grown up with the movie and i love it. its just really hard to see everything that was good about the movie changed so much. It took always all that we love about the anime. All my friends who watched this dvd said the same thing."
2,Not what I expected,"This version of My Neighbor Totoro is the Disney version. I didn't realize when I bought it that it wasn't the version I wanted. I wanted the original with the original voices. I e-mailed amazon and they were very helpful, especially because I couldn't tell based on the listing which voices were in this one. So, I returned the DVD and received a refund. The customer service was fantastic!I subsequently bought the FOX version which is the original, from an outside seller."
1,Why did they have to mess w/ a good thing? Buyer Beware!,I am the biggest fan of both Disney and Hayao Miyazaki so I really am struggling with writing this bad review but hey you people have to know before you buy. This version of Totoro really stinks!!!! Almost to the point of ruining the entire film for me. I couldn't suffer through it when the movie premiered on TCM. Let me explain there was a previoulsy released edition that was put out by Fox which is the best. The english dubbing on the Disney version is horrific. The characters are so off from the original release. Please if you are considering adding this dvd to your collection go with the original fox edition. You are missing out on so much of the movie if you only see this Lame version put out by Disney. I'm sorry to be harsh but Disney really let us down with this english dubbed version of Totoro.....
3,MomO3,"I bought this after reviews said it was good for even the most sensitive children. Oddly enough, my 2 year old loves the Totoro character, but my 5 year old was totally creeped out by it. She was up 2 times that night saying that she was scared of Totoro. Cute movie, but this will be going in the vault for a couple of years."
1,broken tape,"When i received my VHS, i was completely sad that the video tape was broken and hanging out of the case. The vendor was quick to offer a return or a $2 discount, however i had to find someone to fix the tape. It was very disappointing."
2,Just not the same as the original,"Sad to say, this Disney version just isn't the same. For me, the original cast of voices are a vital part of the film. Though my absolute FAVORITE movie, I can't seem to enjoy it as much without the original sound. Why re-do something so perfect?"
1,"Original version is amazing, but Disney is crap.","I loved the Fox version of this film; it was absolutely amazing. I always watched it as a kid, and I still do. When I bought the Disney version, I didn't know there was a difference. As I watched it, I noticed something was wrong; the voice actors were completely different. Disney completely ruined the movie by doing this. The sisters sound exactly the same (the idiots chose twins to revoice-over the movie) and the father sounds plain. In fact, most of the voices sound as though they threw together a bunch of random people with no experience, handed them scripts, and told them to voice their parts without any practice. The Disney version was very poorly done; I highly recommend the Fox version of this movie for the full experience."
1,Not the Original!,"While this is a wonderful story in its original form (the original english adaption), this version is awful! There are no sound effects for the cat bus, the actors' parts are wooden and all of the magic has been leached out by Disney. I am relieved I kept my vhs copy of this movie because I will not watch the Disney release again. If I had perhaps looked more carefully, I would have noticed that it was a remake. I simply did not imagine anyone would change something that was wonderful in the first place. Shame on Disney for butchering such a classic."
4,"""Brings back childhood!""",""" When I was eight I loved this movie. I'm 15 now and I still love it! Totoro is cute, funny, and adventure packed! It's a good video for the whole family. You will find yourself watching it many times!"""
2,Dubbed with new voices,"My sons loved this movie growing up. I thought I would gift each of them, since they are older and still talk about this movie. I thought I was really giving them a special treat from their boyhood days. Unfortunately, the voices were redone with different voice. I should have viewed the cover but, I jumped on the Two-disc Special Editiion band wagon. My sons were very disappointed and I felt bad for not noticing. I will try to return both DVDs and look for the original version."
1,My Neighbor Totoro (Re-Dubbed),"My daughter and I both hated the re-dubbed version of this film. Dakota Fanning is a good actress on the big screen, but her voice does not lend itself well to this Asian influenced film. We both viewed the film as an older VHS version. We were very disappointed in this purchase!"
5,Best Miyazaki film for small children (+ adults too)!,"We began renting Miyzaki films from Netflix after we saw Spirited Away in 2006. My Neighbor Totoro is the film that makes me wish I was a small child again. We watched it with our 3 1/2 year old daughter, who burst into tears when it ended because she wanted to see it again immediately! Two weeks later, she walks around the house singing ""To-to-ro To-toro!"" Bringing the works of Miyazaki (and other Studio Ghibli films) to an American audience is the best thing Disney has done in the last 10 years, bar none (yes, that includes the deal with Pixar, whose films, while charming in their own way, are often too slick by half for me).My Neighbor Totoro appeals to the kid in all of us, and takes us back to a time before deadlines and the pressures of the world came calling."
1,Terrible DVD of a great film,"Aaaargh. Being a Studio Ghibli fan, I had preordered thisfrom Amazon as there are few of the Studio Ghibli filmsavailable on DVD.Unfortunately, what the Amazon listing doesn't makeclear is just how technically bad this DVD release is.It is a hacked-down 4:3 version, with only a 2-channelEnglish audio track (no Japanese or other audio). Thereisn't even a subtitle track (not even english for thehard of hearing).The video and sound quality isn't good either. Also, don'texpect any extras relevant to the film.As the other reviews (obviously from other editions)say, this is a great film. However, this is not a DVDto get."
2,My Neighbor Totoro,"The product I purchased was a remake. I did not realize this until I received and watched the film. I was hoping for an older version of the movie before the wording was fixed. Personally I find the mess ups in the script translation makes the children sound more like children. Overall I did not like the adjusted script nor the actors they chose for the voices. However, I saw the old version first so my opinion may be biased."
2,Not the Disney Release,"We have the VHS version and have almost wore it out watching it ourselves and with the our 2 kids. We purchased the Disney release of the 2 disk set as a replacement. It has lots of extras, but what happened to the original English voice-overs? We were very disappointed that Disney choose to change the voice-overs from that were on the VHS. The actors voices have little emotion and do not fit the character's action well. At some points is sounds like they are just reading dialog. We still watch our old wore out 20th Century Fox VHS version and put the Disney version away.I give the story and animation 5 stars as well as the 20th Century Fox version. But the Disney version only gets 2 stars."
4,Totoro loves any people of all over the world.,"We think Totoro is very cute, and maybe he also think us cute. I want to meet him to say he is quite hilarious and ride on him. In Japan, there're many good Anime which has no violence and has a lot of kindness more than one on violence. But little good Anime has been sold on abroad and many bad one always has been bought there. I'm very sad the fact. So I'd like you to know Totoro is just one of many good Child Anime. By the way I love Disney too. ;-)"
2,Don't replace your old VHS with this Disney version...,"Let me start by saying my family loves this movie and our original VHS is very worn out. I was hoping to replace the tape with the Disney DVD release. I was so disappointed. They changed Satsuki's name - and pronounce it Satski - yuck!! They added unnecessary dialogue - one of the things I love about the original is that it doesn't try to explain everything, it makes you think. If you are trying to replace your old VHS - this is not the one to buy. It's probably fine, for anyone who hasn't seen the original...My Neighbor Totoro"
4,"wonderful movie, not wonderful dubbing","i agree with another reviewer about the original dialogue. our vhs version may not have had japanese people speaking english, but i remember the dubbing and music were more fantastical. the words in this translation are different and not as close to the original dialogue. i wish i could get the pre-disney version on dvd! otherwise, i recommend totoro for anyone over the age of 2! it is a wonderful, feel good, magical movie! my 3 year old wants to watch it every day (not that we let him) now that we've introduced it to him and he loves the cat bus, too!"
5,This is a magical and fantastical movie for young children,My children ages 3 and 4 enjoyed this movie from start to finish. The 4 year old is a boy and has been tackling the idea of big scary monsters for the past month. This movie helped him realize that big isn't always scary and that he and his sister could enjoy something together. It is a magical movie and I recommend it for young children everywhere.
4,Soot spirits strike again,"This movie was a pleasure to watch with my daughter. When Totoro yawned or said his name, my little one jumped from one couch straight into my arms. It was fun to see the look my kid's face as she watch the movie with great intent.The story has a slow pace but it has endearing qualites of family life and a child like vision of their world.I liked the cat bus. Thats right ... I said cat bus!?!Watch it, you'll love it."
5,Next generation,"I remember watching totoro and other studio ghibli movies growing up and now in my mid twenties I still enjoy them as much as I did then. Totoro is absolutely one of my favorites along with howls moving castle that can out a few years back. I have a niece who is almost two who I babysit I was always looking forward to the days when she was big enough to sit and enjoy these wonderful movies that I grow up with and to my surprise she enjoys them as much as I do, she loves totoro and ponyo and Kiki delivery service actually these are the only movies she'll sit for. So I'm glad that I can pass these wonderful movies to the next generation who knows maybe one day she' ll show her niece or nephew."
5,A masterpeice!,"Hayao Miazaki is an incredible artist and writer. If you think that this movie is great, check out Nausicaa of the valley of the wind."
2,new version dumbed down...,"I have loved this movie for quite a long time. I don't know if they were forced to add new voices,if not, it was a very sad mistake. I admit that even dumbed down, it is better than most of the stories out there.But the point of these movies is that they were not dumbed down, and they were very much loved.The visuals are wonderful. I feel bad for the children that don't ever see the real version wherethe story is told as if to someone who is intelligent.The first sign that something was terribly wrong is the horrible thing that they did to the simple and fun opening song, and it just goes downhill from there.I am sorry if there was some dispute or something that forced them to make this change. I wish it had been done more respectfully for the wonderful artwork that it was intended to be. If you are looking to buy this, most certainly get a used DVD of the original. You will be very pleasantly surprised."
5,IT'S ABOUT TIME FOR A REMAKE!,I truly beleve the disney verion is better than the fox verion.5 things i like about this DVD:1.different singer [it's about time]2.the script has changed3.the characters are the same4 in the fox verion they say Satsuki bit in the disney they say Satski5.same storyso what are you waiting for? PICK UP YOUR COPY TODAY!
2,A Butchered Version,"The movie wasn't meant for 4:3. If you want to buy a[n inexpensive] DVD for your kids, and if you only have a 4:3 analog TV set, this US region 1 release is absolutely fine. (The English dub is excellent.) Otherwise, stay away from it. Anamorphic widescreen versions, with English dub and/or sub, are available in other regions."
