5,Great Stargate SG1 Season,This is the last Stargate SG1 season. It is interesting and entertaining especially the last episode where you get the sense that there will be more. Great collector item as it does complete the collection.
3,"A fun episode, but...","I really like the episode, but I must lodge the complaint that the second part is unavailable on Amazon. I found that to be disappointing, especially considering the pivotal nature of this episode. Maybe there is some problem that is beyond Amazon's control, but either way, it really mars the story when only half of it can be viewed."
3,The end of a great show,"It's a pity they ended this show as a bad video clip. And the whole season was boring, except for '200', The Shroud and The Quest I & II... Wish the writers had remained writing SG-1, not the Daniel/Vala show... and I'm a Daniel Jackson fan..."
4,A good ending to the Stargate Series,"Season 10 is one of the better seasons of Stargate. Season 9 was disappointing. The Ori were tedious, and there were idea rip-offs from earlier seasons that weren't well done. Season 10 had less rip-offs, and the several that were had interesting twists. My favorite episode is the one where SG-1 goes to a planet by mistake, and ends up in a very unusual first contact situation. This episode seemed more like the early Stargate episodes, and less like the space opera Stargate seems to have become.The character Vala adds a lot of zest to season 10. This makes up for Daniel who seems to have had enough of Stargate, and seems a bit tired. All in all, I was glad I bought Season 10. I don't watch much TV (too many commercials) so each episode was new. I found myself looking forward to the next episode each time, and actually thinking about and analyzing some of the episodes in between watching."
5,SG-1 Forever,"I have purchased all the other seasons of SG-1 over the years. And this is where I would recommend anyone who is interested in, but has never seen SG-1 to start. Start with Season 1, work your way up. Season 10 concludes series-long plots and opens up some new ones. Not for the novice watcher. You must see the previous seasons or you will be desperately lost in Season 10. But the fun thing is, even if you are lost in it...you will either laugh your tail off or cry your eyes out. I recommend doing both."
4,"Good, but not great","I enjoyed this season, but would've liked it more if Richard Dean Anderson had been in it.I like Ben Browder and Claudia Black, but somehow it just isn't as good as the ""old"" SG-1 was.Overall, it was pretty good."
4,Entertaining,I enjoyed the tv series' final season but it seemed that the story thread was off just a bit. The subsequent Ark of Truth movie filled in missing pieces of the SG1 franchise.
1,stargate sg1 season 10,"im sure this would be great but being from northern ireland i wasnt able to play them on my dvd player , i would have to buy an american dvd player to see them"
1,Stargate bad,"good evening I am really very disappointed to see that MGM & 20th century fox are lying company. With the arrear of the DVD Box Set it wrote there are French language. Really great in French, only 4 episodes is dubbed. I bought dark angel season 2 and the pretender season 4 in the USA ALL the episodes are dubbed in FRENCH!! What a shame it's scandalous!!!Fortunately that there is subtitled!"
3,the end is near...,"I am HUGE SG-1 fan but thought this season bombed,especially the finale. I would use a more colorful word but won't. Waiting to tie things up in a few later movies is a cop-out. I am glad to see this show end, given the way they handled the 10th season. Good-bye!"
5,sg1 season 10,I think season was 10 was alot better to be honest than 9.What a pity there are no more seasons to look forward to......
1,"Great Looks, Poor Quality Soles.","I have owned three pair of these boots over the past 11 years. Each of the first two were extremely well built and lasted over 4 years of daily use. The current pair is less than 3 years old and the sole on one boot has cracked. There is no fix for a cracked sole. The leather uppers have been kept well conditioned, and are in great shape. Because the sole is cracked, the boots are worthless. Save your money and look for a different brand boot."
3,"accurate, but ultimately boring","I have to concur with some of the previous reviewers: while the singing is accurate and fearless, the total disc left me ultimately cold; there is no variation, no shading of colors and I found myself returning to my chores instead of listening halfway through.For real virtuoso AND interesting bel canto singing, listen to Bruce Ford or William Matteuzzi (whose rendition of the Zelmira aria 'Terra amica' on the complete recording under C. Scimone FAR outshines Florez' version)"
4,Great Resource,"This is a great resource for the kosher traveler in New York. The book lists kosher restaurants, who certifies them, what kind of food they have, and a short review. You still need to call ahead to confirm that they are still open. You should always check with your Rabbi to make sure the Hechsher is ok for you."
3,paint problem,"The chimes are lovely but the paint job is not holding up. Have had the chimes up outside and the top,wooden portion is already losing the black paint surface. Disappointing."
3,"Sounds good, build quality is so-so","My only complaint so far about these chimes are the fact they use cheap wood (probably pine) and a cheap tack to hold the strings in place from which the tubes hang. For no particular reason a small crack developed in the wood along the grain and the tiny tack fell out. I replaced it with a screw and seems to be holding fine. They were only hanging outdoors for about a month. I have real doubts about how well these will hold up to the elements, however only time will tell. They are probably better suited for a patio but we don't have one; we only have a deck.I liked how I was able to preview the sound of the chime on-line. The sound was an accurate reproduction of how it really sounds."
4,Arrived early!,The chime I ordered was a gift. It arrived earlier than expected which was a bonus. It was packed pretty tight so I did not get a chance to preview before giving as a gift. From what I saw it was quality product. I would order this brand again.
3,"Lovely, but too LOUD","Woodstock Pachelbel Canon ChimeThe chimes are lovely and seem to be good quality, however I do wonder why the ring to hang them is made of plastic? The sound is very beautiful, but it is too loud for me. It is a good thing that I have three acres because I can't hang them too close to the house. I much prefer the softer Gregorian Soprano chimes."
4,Very pretty wind chimes,"I received these as a gift. The music they play is beautiful, very nice lookng, but it takes a Category 5 hurricane force wind to get them to make music! We had 30 mph gusts and they weren't jingling like I thought they would. My other wind chime was jangling it's head off but it was in the front on the north side. I am thinking it is where we have them, 10 feet from the house on the south side. But I would think they wouldn't need so much wind to work. But still very pretty when they do."
1,Multiple Problems,"Pros:--A pleasant-sounding set of double chimes. The four small bar chimes harmonizing with the larger tubular chimes are an interesting touch. However, see below.Cons:--Small inner striker started to rust after one night outside.--Made in China.--Requires a stiff breeze to make any sound. In 10mph winds, the chimes swayed a bit but hardly made a sound. In gusts, the chimes sounded, but were very quiet and had little sustain. I needed to be within about 10 feet to hear them clearly over the wind, whereas I could clearly hear a neighbor's chimes from farther away through a fence and hedgerow.--The manufacturer foolishly tied a cardboard tag to the chimes' strings using the same type of string. Be careful removing the tag or you might cut the chimes' strings. Why create a small (but potentially big) hassle for the customer?"
3,woodchimes,The product itself is fine but it does not sound like a particular tone. It's nice but not $32.00 worth of nice. Pachabel's Canon windchimes.
3,OK but sounds anemic,This product seems to be well made but I have been very un-impressed with the sound volume. With the included attached pendelum it was barely audible so I added a second pendelum made of 2 CDs which helps a little. Don't expect these chime to be audible for much distance.
5,Such a pretty sound.,"I love these windchimes. The sound is so soothing and rich at the same time. I put them away for winter, and can't wait to put them out again this spring. I've missed the music during the winter, but wanted to keep them protected from the winter elements."
3,Not what I really wanted.,I made this purchase because the chimes that I dearly love were suddenly not produced by the company that I usually purchased them from. The online sales person was helpful but the sound of these chimes were not what I wanted.
3,Not so great,I used this on a couch and love seat. It didn't pick up cat hairs very good. I had to push down hard (which I thought was hard on the couch material) to get it to work. Not recommended. Use your vacuum cleaner attachments or masking tape.
1,Don't waste your money,"It hardly picks up any cat hair; and what it does pick up is hard to remove efficiently. What works well for cat hair on furniture, towels, their bedding, MY bedding, etc., is a double-sided red lint brush made by Evercare. Every time I have tried something new, it is never better than the Evercare."
1,One for the Money,"I gave this film one star because they managed to garner the money to make this waste of time. There were so many great opportunities this plot afforded, but unfortunately, none were taken. The director managed to make the bad scenes go on uncomfortably forever, and I began to wish it really was the end of the world."
1,SERIOUSLY STUPID!!!!,"My god, what a waste of 85 minutes of time! Its really not even worth the time it would take me to type out a list of the countless number of ridiculess, unfathomable aspects of this flop of a movie! All i really want to say is DONT WASTE YOUR PRECIOUS MONEY ON THIS MOVIE! DONT EVEN WASTE 85 MINUTES OF YOUR PRECIOUS TIME ON IT EVEN IF ITS OFFERED FREE OF CHARGE TO WATCH ON CABLE!"
3,Parts are okay though the sum isn't that great,"What is interesting here is the footage of various places around the world as the doomsday clock winds down for the human race--and a couple spends some tempestuous last hours together in a NY loft.There is not much dialogue, though, and somehow it feels as if there should have been a lot more substance and perhaps more hashing out of emotions instead of so much time spent on painting and other quotidian things."
5,A much needed book,"This is a well-structured and well-written text with refreshing examples from a wide range of designers. These examples reinforce the concept that successful design and typography come from critical thinking and that there is no one style or approach that is ""correct.""I plan to require this book in the undergraduate typography class I teach, but because it is accessible even to a novice, I'd recommend it to anyone with an interest in type. One of the strengths of the book is its succinctness, but that may be one flaw as well. When a book is so well done, you want more... (Fortunately there is a website which does have supporting materials for those who want more.) Also if you want a meaty book on the specifics of type, then you should also get Robert Bringhurst's phenomenal book ""The Elements of Typographic Style."" It pairs so well with the overview and examples from Lupton's book.It is a terrific value and well-produced."
4,Typography Taught Terrifically,"Simple and elegant this book has engaged me even further in my exploration of good use of typography. Anne's fresh and encompassing approach makes it easy to get involved in using type well. The book has several exercises and a wealth of information that helps appreciate type, and use typography. The advice is not software specific making it useful for many years to come, and encompasses the printed page and web/screen use of type. A great grounding book in Type and Typography."
4,Very Informative,"The book has good information, but oh man, so much of the type is so tiny, I need a magnifier to read it. What's that about?"
4,A Graphic Design Textbook,"Great book. Articulate, broad, yet concise. Wish it were longer. Would love to have more depth. Using this as a textbook for Graphic Design 1."
4,Editorial Design,It arrived within a week late. The book was used as I ordered. It was still clean. The information is somewhat helpful for editorial design.
5,"Great Book, Intresting History of Type",This book talks about the history and elements of type. As a part-time designer I really enjoyed reading this book and learning about some of the creative people behind typefaces.
2,sophomoric,"Low on substance, weak on style, light on content, sophomoric in execution. I completely agree with Chengiz (""Glossy, colorful, devoid of substance""). Very disappointing.Here are some better books on typography:The Elements of Typographic Sytle (Robert Bringhurst)A Type Primer (John Kane)Anatomy of a Typeface (Alexander Lawson)The Typographic Desk Reference (Theodore Rosendorf)"
2,"A disorderly book, some good advice, much confusion","This book does not accomplish what it sets out to be, according to the subtitle, ""A critical guide for designers, writers, editors & students"". It has some interesting examples of unusual designs and has some value for designers of, for example, brochures or advertisements. But the book has limited value for the remaining targeted audience, as far too much of the book is devoted to oddities and strange designs that a writer, editor or student should NEVER even think of using.The majority of the examples of text settings in the book are unreadable for more than a few lines. No writer who actually wants his or her work to be read should ever want to have the text set in one of these designs.There are some useful guides on matters such as leading and tracking, but these are lost in the overall jumble. The book merits two stars only because of designers might find it useful. All others should avoid the book."
3,"Good history, but impractical","This book is more a brief history of typography than a practical guide for the designer. The author is the scholarly type and in that mode she provides a wonderful analysis of typography's evolution as medium. On the down side, I found the overall tone of the book to be on the pretentious, high-minded side. Practical application of the principles described is not the emphasis."
4,"Well written, informative book","Worth reading if you need to learn more about type, layout grids, and popular fonts of the past decade."
3,don't be deceived by the title,"not quite helpful with thinking with type as the title suggests. more of a brief historical overview of type and such. does not really help you think critically about type. there are a few other books i would definitely if you're wanting for something deeper about type after reading this book. overall, for the price, it's a decent book to own. i do wish the book talked more about the grid system though."
5,Great Book,"I haven't even finished the book, I still have one more section, but I really liked this book. It is definitely a great typography book. I have learned a lot about typography. I didnt know much before this book."
4,nice book,This is just another great type book - beautifully designed and a great guide for anyone with an interest in the subject matter
2,"Highly overrated, badly designed.","After reading all the glittering reviews (and realizing that I could probably do with a little more typeface history and design knowledge), I purchased this book from Amazon. To be honest, I found the inside of the book to be laid out in a very ADD manner, with varying multi-colored, different-sized, intersecting sections of what-not COMPETING FOR ATTENTION. The information itself was good, but to be honest it was so badly laid out that it hindered me from reading any further, and had to force myself to read to the 20th page. As a Master's level Graphic Design student, I am APPALLED at the design or lack thereof of the pages of this book (with the exception of the cover), and even more shocked that this is considered one of the best typeface textbooks there is (and even more so that it was written by a PROFESSOR who is currently teaching in this field). There has to be a MUCH better and reader-friendly textbook on type out there."
3,It's a typography book alright.,"if you are taking typography and this is your required text, then I highly recommend it!"
1,useless,"I wouldn't recommend this book to anybody. just a fiw bits of information from every area, but nothing specific or useful."
1,Several problems with this phone,"The readout is impossible to read if it is too dark or too bright, and the weather sensor drains batteries. Furthermore, I bought this phone and and the voice mail indicator didn't work, so I sent it back for replacement--the voice mail indicator on the replacement didn't work either. The sound was fine but not great. I am now looking to purchase a weather phone from a different company--this one just isn't doing it for us."
4,surprisingly accurate,"I like this phone/weather station, even if I'm the only one who uses it. The drawbacks I found are it is hard to read at times, because it has no back light, unless you hit the snooze button. I don't use the alarm feature so I taped down the snooze button and it stays light now. The other problem I found was the caller id redial doesn't dial 1 before dialing out of area callbacks, but if you hit the one fast enough it works fine. Very easy to setup. I had this up about six month's and so far the batteries still work fine. The other reason I got this phone is 900mhz operating frequency, it will not interfere with wifi or wireless internet like the now popular 2.4ghz phones. this is fun and useful."
2,Scooby Doo Costume,"I was not especially happy with this ""Deluxe"" costume. The size that came was not the size that I ordered, it was a whole different sizing chart. The costume fit because I had ordered a size big, but it only just fit. Also the head piece did not fit like the one pictured and the seams came apart in some places after only wearing it one time. I had hoped to be able to use it a few times, as Scooby Doo is my four year olds favorite character, but I don't think it will hold up. While my son looked cute in this outfit, I was disappointed with it."
2,didn't care for it,"moved too slowly, not enough action, my grandson didn't stay interested in it. He liked Home Alone 3 much more."
4,A pretty good for a sequel.,This film has as many funny lines and as much slap-stick comedy as the first. Makes my 6 year old laugh uncontrollably.
5,My son loves this movie,"The movie can be watched over and over, a worthwhile purchase for continued entertainment. We love it as a family movie."
4,Good value.,My daughter purchased this DVD since she loves this movie. The DVD box showed a little wear but the DVD works fine.
5,Love this movie!!,This movie was a christmas gift that I got for my cousin for her grandchild. It has always been on of my favorites.
3,The 1% Kid,"So a spoiled 1% brat decides to torture two poor 99% men that have resorted to burglary as a last means to provide income. Rather than call the police and tell them he is lost and let them know the location of the burglars, he goes on a spending spree in New York, eats pizza in a limousine before preparing an elaborate set of traps involving repeated pummeling with bricks and heavy tools, spilling paint and varnish on skin, electrocution and setting fire to the poor men with kerosene. Then he has a chat about the importance of trust with a homeless person and feels good about himself. Pretty bad life lesson.They should make a sequel where he is grown up in the Army working as a prison guard on the night shift at Abu Ghraib."
1,Slumlord Writes Book In Jail,This author has served 2 years in jail for Obstruction of Justice and Lying to the Federal Government regarding Lead Paint Hazards in buildings he owned. He is also not legally permitted to rent property or own rental property in the District of Columbia so you may not want to take Real Estate advice from him
5,Great video for childbirth classes,I was a natural childbirth instructor and this was one of my favorite videos for class. It clearly shows how strong and busy a newborn is if he or she is allowed to bond with mom right away... My students were always amazed at this little video.
1,This Book Is Fool's Gold,"""For a book about discerning truth in an age of error, it didn't leave much room for the reader to exercise discernment about truth because the writers were too concerned about making their own points about their own preferences. This book was mainly about the author's opinions about plexiglass preaching, music types and styles, Rick Warren, Wild at Heart, Revolve Bible Magazine, altar calls, consumerism or politics. The title was so short of delivering its intended purpose. It was nothing more than a call to study your Bible, pray every day and tell others about Jesus which I would hope was the reality of someone who is looking to ""discern truth."" This book was a complete waste of time."""
1,Disappointing,"I have no clue how to properly describe this, other than to say it is odd at best. You cannot possibly compare this to a rabbit or some of the other adult sex toys. I would not recommend this."
1,Child Sized,"Although listed as a ladies watch, this watch was way too small for my wrist. It was returned for a credit."
1,BOMBASTIC,"The book is spiritually very poor, no inspiration whatsoever, but self praise and empty poetry.The style is Bombastic. If you want real spirituality go to the sources, read Gurumayi's Guru Swami Muktananda."
2,disappointed,"I have to say, I loved When I Was Puerto Rican so much that I bought Almost a Woman before I had even finished the first book. To say I was disappointed by Almost a Woman is an understatement. I was, in fact, shocked that Santiago whom had written the first book of her memoir so beautifully was capable of such medocrity with the second. I am hesitant to read the most recent The Turkish Lover. I don't want my opinion of Santiago, whom I still feel is a beautiful writer, to slip any more than it has because of this book."
5,Most Enjoyable,"There is not much more that can be said when compared to the things that others have said, except for the fact that out of all three of the books which comprise Santiago's memoir I thought that this one was the best. This installment is the one which shows the reader the most about Santiago, showing her more so as an individual, than the first and the third memoirs. I do highly recommend that one read the books in sequence and just keep an open mind. If one does that, then these books will bless them with their own experience."
3,novel for all cultures,Almost a Woman by Esmeralda Santiago is a thrilling novel. It is one that keeps the reader's interest throughout the entire novel. The trials and tribulations that Negi faces in her life are described in detail. It is a tale of how truly difficult it is to move to a new county and try to become accustomed to its ways. However the novel did tend to make Negi seem as if she was trying too hard to be American but yet she could not forget that she was also Puerto Rican. Overall the novel allows the reader to really see how difficult it is to move to a new country and culture. Santiago did a wonderful job in sharing these experiences with her readers.- Lewis Kelly
1,"NOT AS GOOD AS THE FIRST BIOGRAPHY!!: IN FACT, HORRIBLE!!","This is the biography from Esmeralda Santiago that starts off where WHEN I WAS PUERTO RICAN ends off. That is where the comparison/connection ends, because this book is horrible compared to Santiago's first biography. To sum up one part of the book that really sums up the whole: There is one ""big"" event that happens in this book (won't give it away) and it's 272 pages leading up to it, and when it finally happens, ONE PAGE (and barely that, it's more like half a page) is devoted to describing it. Does that make any sense? Other events are given twenty pages to describe it, and the ""big"" moment for Santiago gets one page? The talented way Santiago describes her whereabouts and experiences are happily evident on her first biography; in ALMOST A WOMAN, they are almost non-existent. This biography is flat, empty, boring, and just plain stupid. Hard to believe the person who wrote it also wrote the first biography."
2,A Slow Read That's Not All That Interesting.,"I don't know, but this book did nothing for me. It was uninspired."
3,Almost a Woman,"Almost a Woman is a chrinicle of the author, Esmeralda Santiago's struggle to find a balance between her past and future in a new country. She yearns for what she pictures to be an ""American"" life whil struggling with her mother's constant mantra of ""just because you go to a school for blanquetos.."" I felt that the author has yet to find a way to be an American Puerto Rican. Her frequent use of Spanglish only serves to confuse those of us who do not speak Spanish. I was annoyed and felt it only proved on thing: How Puerto Rican she is. The fundamental story of a young girl's struggle for independence is blurred by constant ethnic references which kept me from being able to relate to experiences that were, in essence, something we all go through as teens. This book is easy reading and fairly entertaining. People who share Esmeralda's background would especially enjoy it. But if you're looking for more than a time-filler, this isn't the book for you."
5,A memoir about an immigrant coming of age in New York City,"I loved Santiago's first book (When I Was Puerto Rican) and I love this one too. Almost a Woman is a memoir about coming of age in New York City. It is also about the struggle to find her own identity among a large family and a domineering but loving mother. Even though I am not an immigrant or Puerto Rican I found this book very compelling and hard to put down. I only hope Santiago will write a third memoir so I can find out how she gets to Harvard, what happens to her mother, brothers and sisters, if she sees her father again and what happens to her lover. Santiago has become one of my favorite authors!"
4,The Puerto Rican Immigrant experience,Santiago is portraying the struggle that all immigrants and especially Puerto Rican immigrants have to face when they are thrown into the Anglo world. Not only must the protagonist deal with the language barrier but also with her own family and her budding adolescence. She learns how to cope in the Anglo world without giving up her Hispanics identity. It's best read in Spanish.
2,"Not that ""easy"" nor should it be the ""first""...","Not unlike the other books in this series, the piano arrangements are not ""easy"" and there is no experienced piano teacher that would even consider having a first year/beginning level student use this book as their ""first book of Christmas songs."" Why? Because the piano arrangements are not at all at the beginning level...they are more like what you would see in a book for a 2nd or even a 3rd year student. The hand positions are all over the place, with many shifts in hand position, there are many 3 and 4-note chords, there are pieces with both hands reading/playing treble clef, and there are many ledger line notes both above and below the staff. The illustrations are well done as is the cover art, but the piano arrangements themselves simply are not ""easy!"" I would recommend ""My Christmas Fun Book Level One"" instead as it really IS for beginning level piano students and players!My Christmas Fun Book Level One (Holiday Fun Series)"
4,SWEET CHRISTMAS GOODNESS,"THIS HAS ALL THE GREAT CHRISTMAS SONGS EXCEPT FOR ""I WANT A HIPPOPOTAMUS FOR CHRISTMAS"" AND ""ALL I WANT FOR CHRISTMAS IS MY TWO FRONT TEETH"" AND ""THE CHIPMUNK SONG"" OTHERWISE IT IS A GREAT COLLECTION OF TUNES AND ARE EASY TO PLAY ON ANY EUPHONIUM, HARPSICORD, VIBRAPHONE, OR PIANO YOU MAY HAVE LYING AROUND THE HOUSE."
5,Who doesn't love Christmas music?,I love this book and it will help me begin to start playing again.The songs are just perfect. I'll play it all year.
5,Easy Piano for Christmas Songs,My grand daughter likes this music book and finds it easy tolearn and play some of your old favorite Christmas songs.
3,"Nice book, but not a primer level Christmas piano book","This is a great book from Dover Publishing. The layout and illustrations are nice, but there is one infamous typo, and frankly, this is a book for more advanced elementary piano students. As a teacher, I've got quite a collection of Christmas music books, and this is definitely not a ""first book."" If you're looking for more simpler music that's much better geared for younger children, look for the Bastien collection."
4,"A couple of sour notes, but overall...good.","Having purchased this for my kids to use and practice in time for Christmas 2005, I pretested all the music and found it to be a nice starter set of Christmas music for the piano student in their first or second year of training. The arrangements tend to be minimalistic. Caveat: there are at least two obviously wrong notes in The First Nowell and Jingle Bells, so you'd be well advised to correct them once you find them; hopefully they'll fix them by the time a second edition rolls out. Nice features: Each song can be played without turning pages. A charming black-and-white illustration accompanies each song. There's also a list of the songs in order of difficulty for those who want to learn the songs that way."
2,Not a beginner book,"I was really excited about this book b/c I got it free with Amazon's 4-for-3 deal. I was looking for a Christmas book to use with my beginning piano students. While this book is very simply arranged, many of the songs are not in the key of C Major. Several of them are in the key of F or G, even D! Some of the songs also have eighth notes. This is not beginning level! None of my beginners could play from the book. I didn't even get to use it for them this year. I recommend Alfred's Basic Piano Christmas books. Level 1 and Level 2Alfred's Basic Piano Course: Merry Christmas! (Alfred's Basic Piano Library) Level 2seem to be graded much more appropriately."
2,Not easy!!,"I am a high school piano class teacher as well as a private piano teacher to many children- even my high schoolers have a lot of trouble with this book! There are too many awkward finger changes all over the place. I thought the left hand part would be mostly chords (I, IV, V, and V7)- not true at ALL!!! Hardly any chords at all in this book. I ended up writing out all my own Christmas songs for my high school class."
4,good book for a beginner,"Easy arrangements, for a beginner.Many of the good old favorite Christmas songs included, that we like to hear during the holidays."
3,"Nice music book, but not the best...","This is a nice book of Christmas music, but not necessarily the best suited for beginners. I liked about 50% of the arrangements quite a bit, but the rest were only so-so. I have a 7 year old daughter who has been playing the piano for a year, if that helps."
2,Easy - no way!,This book has too many changes in finger position to be considered easy. I suspect the songs are not good versions. I am an adult learner and I'm putting this in the recycling bin; I wouldn't even give this away. I'm taking the advice of the teacher who gave this a three star and looking into the Bastien editions. The only reason I gave this two stars instead of one is that I know I'm no expert.
1,Order Cancelled-Out of Stock.,The item was advertised as available when we placed the order but several days later it was cancelled!Not Good!!
1,Useless,"Terrible product. Say's it'll fit conures, I have a green cheek, she's quite a bit smaller than your average sun conure. Her name is Kira she let's me man handle her most the time, I lift her wings and play with her feet and she's easy going about letting me touch her most the time. However, she wanted to have nothing to do with this product, it was literally IMPOSSIBLE to get it on her. Not to mention it seemed way too small, I know I never got it on her to be for certain and I understand it needs to be well fitted so it doesn't slip off and they can't easily pull it off, but it seemed rather unreasonably small. Very disappointed, dunno how I'm going to take my bird outside this summer, really don't want to clip her wings, seems abusive to me, but this product seemed worse."
2,Toxic Smell,"These are great caps and I have used them for years - work well for driving because no brim. HOWEVER, the caps I received in this last shipment (I seem to lose them regularly) have a VERY toxic smell. I have smelled this before and believe it is the black dye they are using in China - where there is very little consumer/environmental protection. I have returned an office chair because of this smell - no matter how long I left it outside to outgas, the toxic fumes would not go away - likewise a Grizzly sleeping bag more recently.I am letting these hats outgas in the mist for a few weeks and will probably wash them to see if I can make progress.Very disappointed.Greg"
2,buy the Masterclass instead,"On its own, this is an OK book about riding, but it tends to ramble on. Buy Mary Wanless's Masterclass instead, where she clearly presents her principles of riding."
2,"A slow, tedious read, esp. for Beginners","I expected more of this book by Mary Wanless, actually, a lot more. But ""The Natural Rider A Right Brain Approach"" is tough going even for people who have more than a little experience. No mistake about it, there is plenty of good information in the book. The problem is absorbing that information is hampered by the uneven, sometimes disjointed presentation. There are just easier ways to learn the same things than struggling through this book. Mary W.'s videos are a lot better."
5,The Coalwood Way,"I am impressed with Homer Hickam's ability to stitch together the story of his adolescent years in Coalwood, West Virginia, when launching homemade rockets into the sky served as a metaphor for six boys whose imaginations were ignited with every rocket fuse they lit. The Coalwood Way is a story with a memorable ending that is as surprising as it is meaningful.Hickam takes us down the road of his past, paving the way with delightful characters and true experiences revealing his adolescent heart with tenderness. I have recommended The Coalwood Way to several friends. It is a most compelling book, which leaves the reader well satisfied like a traveler who have returned home after a particularly good road trip."
5,Solves my Christmas present problems,"The Coalwood Way is a book for all seasons but it has a built-in Christmas story, too. I'm looking for this one on television in a couple of years. Who could resist that final scene at the Coalwood Pageant when Sonny reads from the Bible except it isn't exactly from the Bible, is it? At every turn, Hickam throws us a curve. I was continuously surprised. I laughed out loud a lot, shed a tear here and there. Hickam is a marvelously gifted story teller. Hope he keeps writing these little gems."
2,The same story...,A story told first time can be fasicnating. As Rocket Boys was. The same story told second time is just boring. The first one had a backbone: boys trying to achieve the goal despite the circumstances. The second one - ranomly selected stories about this or that - I simply don't care. Meaningless and boring
3,"Ok bag, but wish I went with a larger one.","I usually gig with about 7 different cymbals and this bag BARELY contains them all. I struggle to get my 20"" ride in the bag, so there's NO WAY this bag will hold a 22"" cymbal as stated. It has nice fleece pockets, however, I wish they were fixed to the bag and not removable, because that's just one more thing I need to deal with when packing the bag. Also, if you plan to hold many cymbals then I'd suggest getting a bag with backpack like straps as opposed to the single sling on this model. It does the job, kinda. I'm find myself having to readjust the strap on my shoulder every 15-20 feet. Yeah, the more I think about it, this bag sucks! Look for a better one is my advice."
3,GOOD CANNED SALMON,"THIS IS GOOD BUT NOT AS GOOD AS ""Copper River Reserve Smoked Sockeye Salmon, Three 7 oz. Jars"" MORE EXPENSIVE BUT WORTH THE PRICE."
2,"Good salmon, but too expensive","Alaska Smokehouse makes some great smoked salmon, but I thought the price for THREE SIX-OUNCE CANS was too high. I feel likethis itemis a better deal."
3,Not what I was looking for,"I suffer from a piriformis syndrome and after looking at Aaron Filler's site saw a link to this book saying that 'every sufferer of spine and nerve pain should read'. As piriformis is a nerve pain I decided to buy and read it. Piriformis is mentioned no more than four or five times, and no treatments are mentioned for the syndrome at all which is disappointing considering Filler seems to be the leading figure in treatment for the syndrome. So probably a good book if you have general lumbar issues, but don't buy if you don't have specific spinal problems."
4,Do you really need back surgery?,"Good book, explains alot of diagnosis and treatments. It was published in 2004 so I wonder if information is really still current."
1,Back surgery,The book really doesn't answer the question. It merely just defines different terms and different surgurical options.Thats it!
4,An excellent reference,"Generally considered to be the ""bible"" for those involved in labor-management arbitration procedures, this book is an invaluable reference in researching workplace disputes. There is ample reference to past arbitration awards, but what I have found to be of greater value is the viewpoints of different arbitrators to different issues, giving one an ability to get some insight into the thought processes that arbitrators use in determining the applicability of various contract provisions to the arbitration process.As a union official, I have found that using this book while researching grievance issues has been a real time saver and, along with the use of other reference materials, has been valuable in determining whether or not to pursue grievances to the arbitration stage.While the price is steep, it pales in comparison to the cost of going into an arbitration proceeding less than fully prepared."
5,A Pleasant Change of Pace,"This CD offers an alternative to the traditional Russian composers and piano accompaniment of most ballet class music. The violin and piano combination is refreshing, the tempo varies from track to track, and the emotion of the musicians is inspiring to my students."
5,BRAVO!,"Bravo! Steven has truly crossed boundaries with this CD! The music literally screamed combinations to me from the moment that I heard it! Although I have heard recordings in the past that included other instruments, in my opinion none were as integrated as this. The artistry and talent of these two musicians are complimentary to each other in a way which I have never experienced before. I have found that the addition of the violin is a fabulous teaching tool...the dancers need to learn how to listen to more than one instrument when they are learning choreography, and the rhythms and melody are so very clear here that it makes it very easy to work with. I use recorded music for many of my classes around the world, and I have not used another recording since I obtained this one! A must have!!!Thom ClowerInterlochen Arts Academy"
1,Don't Get it,"I first bought the Sybex book, memorized it, and took the test. I failed. I found out that the Sybex book didn't have nearly enough information, and I decided to buy this book and try again.What a fool I was. This book didn't help at ALL and I failed the exam once again! I got a PERFECT on all of the questions in this book - what a waste of my time!I ended up getting the MSPress book and passed with an 860. Don't waste your time - get the MSPress book."
1,Urgent,"Sorry, but I still haven't received the books I purchased I really want you to give me a reply because I have already paid my credit card debt."
3,"Not bad, better than the one for 70-210","I thought this book was better than the 2000 Professional book by the same authors. I do agree with the other reader that said there were questions at the end of the chapters that weren't covered in the text, however. And it could have gone a little more in depth in a lot of areas. I used the Sybex books for the NT4 track and would say these are about the same. I passed both exams though with a 900 and 800 respectively. I think I'll try the Exam Cram series for the electives."
4,Worth t o buy but not enough alone,The book is quite good for the beginners to get enough detailed knowledge about all the required subjects but exam is quite tough also. I passed with 840 with the help this book plus Microsoft MSCE w2s and Trancender. Especially there were lots of disk mngmnt questions. The book is giving some clues about the subject but not much in detail. You should really experience this situation and troubleshooting parts with the help of other references. But it plus some others. You will be happy.
4,A Good one but not the best,"This is a very good book, i obtain a scoce of 960 in this examn with this book, the Microsoft Readiness Review and the Transcender, this combination is the best, the only reason that i don't give the five stars to the book is that some times they explain a objective in such a manner that they make it harder to understand, and i realize that reading some information on the net, sorry for my english, just do your best..."
3,Not as good as touted herein,"The book misses some key areas that are covered in the exam. Overall, I was troubled by the lack of editing and several major factual errors. This book might be sufficient to pass the exam, but you'll likely want to supplement the book with sample exams so you know what you're missing."
3,Passed the test but not because of this book,"This book is very wordy and has several instances of inaccurate information and typo's that make for difficult reading. The test questions in the book and on the CD are mostly ambiguous and often don't give enough information to properly answer the questions. Although I did pass the test, it was mostly because of experience, not because I read this book."
5,An All Time Favorite,"I am a diehard Commissioned fan and am so encouraged by their music ministry. I bought the album and fell so in love with the tunes that I sing them to myself all the time. If you've never heard this album, then I would highly recommend it to your music library. Songs like ""Ordinary Just Won't Do"", ""Back in the Saddle,"" and ""No more Loneliness"" will lift your spirit and soul. I loved ""If My People"" and ""A Life that Shows"" as they exhort us to be the people of God that we're supposed to be. But my favorite tune that I've always play 1,000 times (you'll love this one, too) is ""Here I Am (More than a Conqueror)"". You'll love the lyrics: ""Winter, spring, fall and summer, with the Word of God I am an overcomer."""
5,Can we say... classic?,"To me a classic song is one that transcends time. It's a song that has relevance long after it's released. Commissioned's music is classic. Read their lyrics from even the late '80s albums and the songs still relevance (i.e. Perilous Times). If you buy this album, you will be ministered to through music from this past. This ministry has helped me grow as a person. And I, along with countless others, consider myself ""their biggest fan""."

3,Many important poems are missing from this selection.,"Caveat emptor: nothing later than 1922 in this collection - i.e. nothing from 'The Hollow Men', 'Ash-Wednesday', 'Ariel' poems, the Four Quartets, etc. etc. A seriously deficient selection."
2,confused,I am only able to read the titles on this download. My kindle is new. Can anyone tell me how I'm meant to read the actual poems?
3,Very general information,It tells describe some principle of permaculture. It's a little boring side of documentary film. I didn't learn much what I didn't know already. It showed several farms and businesses employing the permaculture. I was looking for more hands-on instead of general broad information.
5,We love it!,"We only wish that there were expander packs! We have so much fun playing Settler's of Zarahemla. I was surprised to come here and find the price point so high ($299.99), which I can only assume indicates that it is now out of production. That is so sad. You would think that a game this great would only gain popularity. We also have Settlers of Catan in our home, but since picking up Settlers of Zarahmela, it never gets played-- our kids prefer this one!"
3,ultimately a sad movie about death,"Sometimes because you can make a movie, doesn't mean that you should?Paul Newman directed this movie and the acting is and actors are all pretty good: the plot material is just pretty dreadful.A father and son living together after the mother dies are just kind oflost in life. During the movie some things get better but most get worseso that the overall picture isn't a happy one,if realistic."
4,~Cute!~,"This is my 3rd My Scene doll, and I'm very happy with her!! She has 3 very cute tees, and a very soft, and fluffy pair of pants!! A face looks like shes looking at something at the left, and she have such great quality hair, it's such a delight to brush it with a comb!! (Not included) she comes with a dog, and 3 tees, and some cardboard magazines. One tee has a butterfly in the center.(This will be the one Barbie is wearing when she comes!!) The other says 'I <3 River', and the other one is sort of tight, and it has alot of scribles in it. her body is very smooth, making it easy to dress, and i love her rockin shoes!! Hope this Helpes!!Barbie Fan"
5,Loved this Book!,"I loved the short stories by Rose Wilder Lane, (especially ""Innocence"") and Laura's pieces are also touching & well-written -- definitely recommended for the die-hard Ingalls-Wilder fan and for anyone interested in good short stories. Rose Wilder Lane will really impress those people who haven't read anything by her before."
1,This book is boring.,"The ox-bow incient is probbly the worst book i've read. It is not exciting, and they don't tell the main character's name untill halfway through the book! This book also has too many insults and bad words and is racist to African Americans. To sum it up, if you like exciting books, don't read this one!"
4,Analyzing the mob mentality,"This story provides a great picture of what it was like living in the old west. In spite of attempts by some level headed men to control the town's outrage over a despicable crime, a number of men are roused into vigilante justice when some rustlers steal a herd of cattle and kill the owner in the process. This novel analyzes the mob mentality and how easy it is to fall into that trap. After all, these men are just trying to get justice for the murder of one of their own. The tension over the mob's shifting emotions is conveyed beautifully, and the lack of any patience for more information about the supposed murder eventually leads to tragic results. The story is a bit slow overall, being overly descriptive, but it really places you there at the time and place. I'm not a big fan of westerns, but this one makes a convincing statement about the importance and difficulty of assuming someone is innocent until proven guilty."
2,"Uneventfull,unrealistic-hard to follow","I just completed this book in my sophmore english class. I feel that this book had alot of unused potential. It was very slow and uneventfull throughout the first three chapters, and I had trouble following the plot with so many characters popping in and out. The fourth chapter climax was a little easier to follow, considering the drastic change in action from people wandering the streets to the discovery of the accused ""rustlers"". Chapter five went slowly again, but having less characters involved in it made it easier to read. Over all, I thought this book was fairly confusing and hard to follow."
2,It hurt my English grade,I found the book to be dull not like westerns that I have read in the past I was told the book got better but it did not. If you have to choose a book for a english class do not pick this one unless you want to buy the cliffnotes because thats the only way you can pass your class.
3,The Ox-Bow Incident,"I thought that overall this book had a good story in it but, i found it hard to get through all the scenery that they talked about,it was an interesting book but i don't think that it should be added on to the book list because it in a way reminded me of mice and men."
3,Hmm...,"The short: 1.great theme overall 2.okay plot 3.you should read it, but only if you have the time to waste by reading the first 100(tedious) pages and ENDLESS descriptions."
1,a very boring book,This book was very hard to get into. The first 100 pages just talk about people playing cards and walking around town. There is absolutely no action at all. Once the posse finally leaves the town they find the suspected rustlers right away. It is quite an anti-climax because you bore through the first two-thirds of the book only to find the climax very short and lacking the necessary action that you suspect from a western.
1,plain bad,"I'm sorry, I just found this book just a bit short of silly. And I am a western fan. The character development was shallow and the story line predictible while at the same time unrealistic. If you want a book on philosophy there are ones that are much better."
1,ienalfbnslrgn......that's about how meaningless this book is,"This book, even though it was not even 200 pages, is the most boring book that I've ever read. The author, at one point in the book, took well over a page describing 3 pictures in the wall. I thought that since he was describing them so much, they would have some significance in the story, or maybe be important at the end, but they weren't. Those couple pages turned out to be just another couple of pages I wasted my time with that could've been used doing something else more useful in life. If you're an avid book reader and wish to continue being one, don't pick up thise book, because it will forever leave a sour impression of reading in your mind."
3,The Ox-Bow Incident,"This book was overall and okay book. In a way it reminded me of a book called Mice and Men, there was alot of scenery in this book and the author had the same writing style. I though that this type of book was already covered in literature in high school because of the kind of book it was so i would not agree with it being put on the list"
4,A Western With Big Ideas,"Walter Van Tilburg Clark's The Ox-Bow Incident stands as a classic and has earned that standing. It is peopled with all the usual characters of a western novel but this time the usual themes of rugged individualism inherent in such works are turned on their heads. The author puts all of these stock characters to use in showing his ideas concerning lynching and the true spirit of the west. Each chapter reads like a set piece with much dialogue. It often feels like it is trying to work as a play but, for full effectiveness, it was right that it be set as a western novel, the place where many of the myths of the West first became established. The novel picks up momentum and finds much tension and emotional truth strew among all the larger examinations of ideas. It is gripping, both in the gut and in the mind."
3,Slow to start,"This book starts off as a typical western with gambling, drinking, and a threat of a fight. However, about 1/3 of the way through, things change and the book gets interesting and the characters begin to talk about justice and process of law. The book isn't too bad. However, it takes a lot of patience to get into. I found myself fairly bored by the first third of the book, but really getting a lot out of it by the time the posse leaves the town. There is a lot to learn from this book. It is a shame that it takes so long to get there. The author also does a fantastic job of showing each person's grief and emotional struggles throughout the story."
3,Disappointed,"I have read all of WEB's books and have waited anxiously for each new one. For the first time, I thought that it took forever to get into an of his book's with the constant repetition of what has happened in previous books, endless dialogue and details that somehow seemed irrelevant. Yes, there are moments of suspense and the characters are believable, but in all, not up to par to what one might suspect with as relevant a theme as "" oil for food""."
2,Snore...,"I've read all three books in this series. Really liked the first one, second one was ok, but this one was disappointing. Very little plot advancement and FAR too much of the characters rehashing events that had already occurred with each other. I'm sure that kind of thing probably happens in real-life FBI and CIA investigations but it's not necessary to subject your readers to it. I can't figure out why in the world Griffin felt it necessary to use up valuable page space with so many plot rehashes, unless of course he was intentionally doing it to meet his publisher's requirement for manuscript length.I actually put this book down about halfway through and was able to pick right up where I left off about a month later without having to go back and refresh my memory about what had happened earlier in the book, because a) there wasn't much of it, and b) I figured (correctly) that Griffin had built in more rehashes later in the book. And no, that's not a compliment."
3,Good but overly long,"I have have enjoyed some other works by this author. This was also an interesting story line but it could have been done in half the pages. If you want a very detailed view of what top operatives might do in a day (where and what they eat, how they manage to keep their cell phones charged, what credit cards they use, etc.) then this is a must read."
1,"Superficial, lengthy","I found this one of the weakest books I ever read. In a nutshell: the main hero of this book constantly travels around the world, meets lots of people, many of whom support him because they are old buddies and while traveling he works on a presidential mission. While it is a nice idea of the author to use foreign language to show off his expertise, a lot of the German language is plainly misplaced. Oops! While this is just a bit annoying there is a lot of repetition - the hero tells the story of his chase to basically everybody he meets - and the characters do not develop into more than superficial want-to-be cool action heros. I didn't find any suspension in there at all.When I bought this book I actually also got a second Griffin novel. I hope this is better. If not, it is at least not that voluminous..."
1,BORING boring borrrr . . . zzzzzzzzzzzzzz,"The main character Carlos Castillo is an egotistical, arrogant jerk. His cohorts are portrayed as little more than sychophantic lapdogs. And somewhere in the book is hidden a plot. But it takes hours and hundreds of pages to figure out it's a plot not worth reading. Unbelievably bad writing. How does this author get away with writing such drivel?"
2,Everything is Too Neat and Easy,"Having read Griffin's other books featuring Castillo I was eager to read this one. It is ok. Not great not awful. The editting or transferring to kindle(whatever you call it) is sloppy with many many errors. And everything is too convienent. Everyone speaks flawless Russian, Spanish, Germany or Hungarian like a native. Everyone knows everyone else. I like to suspend reality- thats why we read fiction- but I do like to believe that what I read could actually transpire.I am going to buy the next in the series but if it is much like this one it will be my last."
2,Pretty Boring!,"I read ""The Hostage"" first and thoroughly enjoyed it. From that positive experience, I decided that I should check out W.E.B. Griffin's books further. I just finished ""The Hunters"" and it was pretty boring and long winded. There was no action to be found and the whole book revolved around Castillo's crew running all around the world doing nothing. I'm not sure if I'll read any other W.E.B. Griffin books."
2,Dissapointing,"After really enjoying the first two books in this series, The Hunters is a big let down. I stopped reading it half way through because I was tired of both Griffin summarizing the previous 2 books for those readers who hadn't read them, and I was tired of Castillo continuing to fill every new character in on the ""presidential finding."" It is as if Griffin is so proud of his Castillo character and his nifty lifestyle that he has to continue to pound it into the readers skull how special he is. WEB: we don't care, we want some action, and action does not involve reading for the 18th time how Castillo does indeed hold dual citizenship, answers only to the president, and flys around the world in a G3. Good lord there was no reason to turn the pages accept to hope that the author would actually start putting some suspense in the story as opposed to a grocery list of people that Castillo had to fill in on the story. Did I mention the book is repetitively dull?"
1,Frustrated beyond belief,"I liked the first 2 books, but the Hunters drove me NUTS! It was beyond repetitive, the writing was trash, there were so many spelling mistakes that you wonder if it was ever edited! Please do not try to write in a different language without consulting someone that can speak it. The mistakes were unbelievable.Nothing happens until 3/4 of the book - all it is Castillo going from one country to the next telling a history of the last book over and over again to anyone that will listen. I finally started skipping pages without missing anything..I want the days back that it took to read it."
3,Errors in text,"In the presidential series - ""The Hunters"". All female charachters are referred to as ""He"" or ""Mr."" throught the book. It is rather confusing?"
2,Huh?,"Compared to other Griffin books, this was a major disappointment. There was very little action which I was expecting. Way too much time was spent on praising the main character to the point that you wondered when he was going to walk on water. This was one of those books that you might have thoughts of dumping half way through."
5,WEB Griffin Continuing Excellence,WEB Griffin has consistently provided readers with an intrigueing and fast moving storyline and characters. This third book in the series is again one of his best and continues his predominance of the genre.
5,Castillo Rocks!!!!,"I just stayed up all night and read Griffin's latest from cover to cover. I've read everything he has ever written and as soon as I finish each new one I can hardly wait for the next. This book is fast paced and reads easily. I like all the extra info you get on weapons, history etc - stuff I know nothing about. If you want a really great read, buy this but make sure you have a Saturday night to spend reading. I couldn't put it down!"
5,Book Review,The book was received in perfect condition and in a timely way. The service and product were without error.
1,beware,they say it fits 1992 gmc c1500. but it dont. make shure it is the right mirror for your truck before you buy.
1,Not a new phone,"The Motorola box label says ""NEW"" but it isn't. Horrible product. This phone is not new and the attempt at refurbishing is horrible. Glue is visible around some buttons and the fit is sloppy."
1,it's not a new phone,"it's not a new phoneI have never had such a poor shopping experience, description of goods which are new, but what does refurbished. And workmanship is very rough. Junction do not fit, a prominent 1-2mm. The battery cover can not close completely. Too bad!"
1,Faulty battery,"Got the phone yesterday and it was a nice looking phone. Exactly what i wanted. Heres the but.... The battery was warped. Very noticeably warped. Almost ready to explode. I threw it back in the box as quickly as i could, sealed it back and now i have to return it which will probably be such a hassle. I guess i could just purchase another battery to keep from having to go thru that headache. Motorola is really at fault though."
1,This book was a complete waste of time...,"... Ed Greenwood has little grasp of plot, charachter development, or suspense. This book reads like a fifth grade book report. It is definately the worst of the Harper series and one of the worst books in the Forgotten Rhealms setting."
2,"Good start, poor book.","The start of the book is ok. Anything about the silver sisters is somewhat interesting. The only problem is there is so much randomness going on in the book that it is hard to follow. Ed Greenwood is not the greatest writer, and I agree with others that anyone looking for a good fantasy book should look elsewhere. Too much random nudity, destruction, and plot lines."
4,Mistrust must be overcome to protect the Firefall Keep.,"Someone, or something, is killing servants, armsmen and nobles in Firefall Keep. Killing them with evil magic that leaves no trace.The Seven Sashes, a group comprised of seven of the realm's mightiest war wizards, are unable to locate the killer and even some of their own members are being found dead.Storm Silverhand, one of the chosen servants of the goddess Mystra, finds that the killer looks desturbingly like her long dead love. Will she be able to prevail over the killer without bringing down the Keep? First she must overcome centuries of mistrust, fear, and poisonous intrigues from those she is duty-bound to protect."
1,I had no clue what it was about. May 6th 2001,I'v read lots Fantasy books and on StormLight I had no clue what was going on. I don't even know Storm's personalty. It's like just reading about some one whos talking in a boring voice. All i got was that her sister was a floting head .But if you want to read it I think you shouldn't.
5,If you loved the movie then you'll love the soundtrack.,"If you saw the movie and enjoyed the ""Rock-a-billy"" music then you'll love this soundtrack. Get it now before its too late."
1,Not made for Golflogx.,Cup holder is fine... but trying to get the golflogx in the holder doesnot function well... To use it so won't fall out you have to cover all the buttons with the pressure mount.... which means taking it out each time....PIA... May work for other devices but not for golflogx...
5,GPS Holder,Not sure how I got along without this product. Works very well in the golf cart cup holder...very secure. It is a must for GPS users.
1,Save your money,I bought this when I had lost my other magnetic holder. If you're going to stay on the cart path (and it's smooth) then you may not have to worry about it falling out every 2 minutes when you go over a bump. I do not recommend this at all.
2,LIMITATIONS ARE DISAPPOINTING,"Outside Mosaic is nice. Clay back easily broken under cast iron metal supports. Must attach stand in back (requires phillips screw-driver) with-out instructions, glass - back support very loose and stand does not secure well. Stands vertically only, and does not hang. Limitations are disappointing."
2,Lots of Reading!,"This book has great suggestions for cooking healthier, however there is a lot of reading!"
5,Awesome recipes!,"I've had this book for nearly ten years. The reason I'm looking at it again online is because I've used it to pieces, literally! I need a new one because mine is faded and falling apart. My family loves the recipes. Many are traditional like lasagne and chicken enchiladas and many are newer, more creative ideas. Honestly, we don't cook the recipes as fat-free. We live in Germany and fat-free food doesn't exist here so we cook with normal cheese, sour cream, tomato sauce, etc. and they taste wonderful. I use this book more than any of the others. There's a vegetarian section, side dishes, etc. They all taste great. You can't go wrong with this cookbook because it has a nice twist from the traditional Betty Crocker recipes."
2,Too many ingredients,"When making any of these recipes, I found myself buying certain ingredients specially for one recipe. They can get expensive to make. The recipes themselves are not great."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY!,"Thank goodness I only paid a penny for this book. Ok, well the $3.99 to ship it made this book cost $4. I feel like Amazon should pay me $20 for the time I wasted even trying any recipes. I'm sorry but there is no other way to say it but, this book just sucks. It's a long list of ingredients many times, and the end result (along with your time spend preparing it) is never spectacular. I'd say, that several of the recipes I tried could even be called 'craptacular'! For all that effort to be met with disappointment (and family NOT enthused...read: wasted food!) really ticks me off. I'm a good, experienced cook so it's not like I'm not understanding the rocket science if you know what I mean! You can find any one of a handful of great books if you want fat free cooking. This, sadly, is NOT one of them. I also tried this author's fat free baking book and almost gagged on the three things I made. Just...don't go there. Run away, find another book! This one is awful!"
5,Concentrates on the basics of fat free and low fat cooking.,"If you're looking for a cookbook that gives you many delicious, easy-to-prepare, low fat/fat free recipes--and also shows you how to modify your favorite recipes--this is it. A registered dietician, Sandra Woodruff concentrates on making foods low in calories and fat, and high in nutrition. Not to mention delicious, and extremely easy to prepare. This is probably the cookbook I turn to most often (besides her ""Secrets of Fat Free Baking""). My husband--a traditional meat 'n potatoes kind of guy--even loves these recipes. One of his favorite meals now is the Chicken Fingers with Honey Mustard Sauce. My one complaint is that the book is not indexed very well. So, if you've got a favorite recipe--you'll have many in here--be sure to save that free amazon.com bookmark that'll come with this must-have cookbook."
4,The best,"I own quite a bit of cookbooks, and already this is tattered from kitchen use. My husband and daughter love the desserts in this book. It takes a little extra time but the carrot cake is excellent. So is the Italian pot roast. I'm a tweaker when it comes to receipes, but I didn't with this book!"
5,Loved it for years,I have been using this book for several years now. The lasagna recipe and oven baked fried chicken are wonderful. I have made so many of the recipes and they are all very good. Highly recommend.
5,The Ultimate Companion to Genet's Writing,This is the most detailed study of Genet ever written - and it deffinately sheds some light on his character both in writing and in life. I refer to it constantly when I am reading his books. I wish there were biographies like this of some of my other favorite authors - without a doubt I am excited to read White's book about Proust.
2,Ridiculous blended with the sublime,"I am going to load this CD on my computer so that I can delete half of the tracks. Whoever had the bright idea of having someone rap out Cole Porter songs must've been on drugs. Cole Porter songs are known for their polished lyrics. Having hip-hop artists add what they think of as poetry is a travesty.Some of the cuts are excellent. Sinead O'Connor needs to do more standards. Annie Lennox can sing anything and I'll love it. Tom Waits, on the other hand, sounds best singing his own music. Song samples listed on the Amazon web page give the best segments of the songs, not a representative sample. So, if you enjoy experimenting, or can afford to buy a whole CD for a few good tracks, get this CD. If you want an album of Porter's standards this is not for you."
4,Surprising and wonderful,"Wonderful, unsusal and surprising new arrangements of Cole Porter standards. A few - Neneh Cherry's I've Got You Under My Skin, eg - are so personal as to elimininate the melody, which after all is half of what one loves about Cole Porter (I'm not giving up my Sinatra), but most - like David Byrne's Don't Fence Me In - are as good as the classic recordings of these songs."
3,Not our favorite CD but not our worst.,We bought this CD back when it was newly released. We listened to it maybe 10 times but we don't listen to it much anymore. It didn't have staying power for us.
2,Defectt in CD,"The CD's I purchase although appearing brand new and packaged as such both skipped, repeating a portion of the track over and over.I suppose this may happen but I have not experienced this it all my other purchases of music.As to the content on other tracks; interesting interpretation of the great Cole Porter.Thomas McIntyre"
1,Crazy MP3 Link,"It says click here to download, which is what I wanted to do. It turns up some crazy album. Amazon will have to get a LOT better at searching and user interface to win me over from iTunes."
3,Reason to buy? k.d. lang and Lisa Stanfield,"What Lisa Stanfield does with ""Down in the Depths"" will absolutely raise the hairs on the back of your neck, and k.d. lang's delivery of ""So In Love"" is heart wrenching.If you buy this album for just one or two tracks: own it to listen to what these masters of vocal artistry can do with a song.(Some of the interpretations by other artists were immediately forgettable when the album was released and have definitely become dated.)"
2,Not up to the standards,"It's Cole Porter, he's a classic. However, the materialis unforgiving and shows us just how bad most of thesesingers are. The one person who does justice to it isK. D. Lang. She's amazing here, just amazing. It's aworthwhile cause, buy the album and listen to her cut.She can hold her own against Ella, but with a differentstyle."
1,Back to the Kitchen!,"This CD was produced for a laudable cause but is lacking in every other respect. It brings to mind something Sir Winston Churchill once said, ""This pudding has no theme."""
3,worth a listen,"some out and out garbage( thompson twins,jungle brothers,neneh cherry,tom waits)and some truly bizarre interpretations. Most of it is interesting to at least listen to even if it isn't true to the spirit of Cole Porter.Worth it for annie lennox,u2,kd lang and lisa stansfield. in fact, more than worth it. lovely covers by these artists. There are versions here that I cannot get out of my head and this disc is a regular play for me. Although uneven, I highly recommend this disc."
2,Let's call the whole thing off,"I wanted so much to enjoy this, but was VERY disappointed in almost ALL of the arrangements, I should have heeded some of the reviews I read here that came into my mind as I frantically changed tracks to find something that I liked. Buy it used."
4,Getting reacquainted with an old friend,"It's great to revisit R,H &B after more than 20yrs ago when I had it on cassette. I bought it for a friend in Australia who had never heard it before, despite his interest in Cole Porter and many of the artists who contributed to it. Surprised it wasn't on iTunes, but delighted to find it on Amazon. Fave tracks still Debbie Harry & Iggy Pop - well did u evah? And Kirsty McColl's version of Miss Otis Regrets... but really I like them all and still think these renditions of Porter's classics are definitive for a generation."
4,Updated versions of classics,"Having read some of the other reviews of this CD I felt compelled to write one of my own. I agree that some of the renditions of Cole Porters songs are I'm sure not what he intended, but I would have to say that I don't think there is really one bad song on the album. I am sure that as an artist he would appreciate what most of these other artists have done with his songs. There are some songs that I like better than others, but then we all have different tastes. This is definitely an enjoyable album, and 20 songs for under 12 bucks is not to be sneezed at. One thing I do agree with everyone on is that is is worth buying even if you only like a couple of the artists on here, simply for the fact that the money goes to a great cause."
3,disappointed in disc quality,"I have been looking forward to owning the CD for a number of years. The first half of the disc was surperb, and exactly as I remembered, unfortunately the last few tracks (which are my favourites) kept skipping and would not play properly."
1,Can you forgive the Spoilers?,"This Oxford World's Classics edition contains two appendices titled Explanatory Notes and Who's Who. Unfortunately, they give away plot developments not only for this book but also for sequels in the Palliser Novels, of which Can You Forgive Her? is the predecessor to this work. This seems altogether unforgivable, so I recommend you seek out another edition. The novel itself is quite good if you have a lot of time; I was looking forward to the sequels, but now that I know so much of what is going to happen..."
2,Phinneas Finn,I didn't like the title character and few of the novels other characters. Tediously long. I read it as a Trollope book group selection I had hoped for something better.
3,A quiet novel that grows on you...,"Anthony Trollope takes his time in developing his characters, oft times repeats himself, and moves the story along slowly. It is a typical victorian novel in tone and style that appeals to readers who can't get enough of Thomas Hardy-like novels. Although you can't put Trollope in the same company with Hardy, you still learn much in the societal ways of the era that each imparts with his own style.I enjoy novels that paint pictures and transport you to another era. I take my time reading them as I imagine the author took in writing them. As the Phinneas Finn story unfolds, you begin to understand the context of the times and how that has been passed on to present times. Each evening, as I read aloud to my wife and daughter, we find ourselves entertained as well as enriched."
1,Leftist propaganda,This book is a collection of leftist victimology and propaganda. A total waste of time. This is what we come to expect out of academia.
1,Would know this toy better if it worked ;-),This looked like a good toy for my 2 yr old. I ordered it for his birthday. It arrived in perfect timing but this did not work even when I changed batteries. I contacted the seller B and A computers but they did not even respond back to me. So overall the experience was very bad with the toy and the seller. I will never buy anything from the seller B and A computers.
1,Don't buy anything from Kid Station,"I don't have this particular toy, but did have another piano with the Little Tikes name plate made by Kid Station.What a piece of junk! It died less than a month after we got it ... and the customer service team at Kid Station is USELESS.Do yourself a favor ... buy another product."
5,Jaylyn's second birthday,This is the toy with the background music and she'll play the croc toy along with this one and also dance.
1,Little Croc didn't make it to Christmas,Little Croc worked fine in the store but when we opened it up on Chirstmas Day it did not work. We changed the batteries and it still didn't work.
3,Love this piano - but has one major flaw,"My son loves this piano, but there is one major flaw. The volume on this piano starts out at the highest setting. Even if you change the volume, after a certain amount of down time it goes back up. My son has also learned that if you turn the piano off then back on again it gets reset to the highest volume. This piano is very loud at this setting. If you want this piano I would recommend stuffing something in front of the speaker."
4,Great Fun Toy,"I bought this for my 2 1/2 year old nephew. It is adorable and has multiple sounds, including instruments and other sounds. It is a great size, not too big (it can be set on a table or lap) and not too small (it can also be used directly off the floor)! He loves it and ""plays"" for me every time I visit!"
5,The ESSENTIAL Companion to This Business of Music,"Every time I purchase This Business of Music, I also purchase a copy of MORE About this Business of Music. The two books are a perfect compliment to one another with the best information available on the music business in one concise location."
5,Educational Entertaining,I used this a an introduction to conversation about the history of South Africa with my girls. Whoopi is sensational in this role.
3,Freedom,Was excited when I received the movie. I needed it in a hurry but the s/h was more than the movie which I felt was horrible espically when I reviewed the movie and it wasn't as clear as I thought I would be. But I guess nothing is guaranteed. But I received it on time with poor vision.
4,Must see,"This is a must see movie that is powerful and moving about the lives of South African students as a result of apartheidIt is a musical, but the musical bits are not overwhelming and do not take away from the story.In fact they add great depth and meaning to the storyAlthough Whoopi Goldberg has top billing in the movie, the other cast members keep up and a couple of them supercede her star performanceIf you have to add a movie to your bucket list, this is the one.And I learned the songs by heart now because I watched so many times :)"
5,The great inspiration for many groups in the sixties,"The Rolling Stones, Cream, The Doors, all have made their version of a great number composed by Willie Dixon. I don't know if the origianal or the copy is the best, but here you have all the originals collected on one CD and that's great."
4,Great collection done by the Man himself!,Not the best versions of these songs but he's the man that wrote them all. In that sense this is an unparralled album.
5,Willie Dixon,"I really like this album and would recommend it to anyone who care for blues and the older, more historic blues. Thanks."
5,Great Chillin' Chicago Blues,"If you wanna hear the blues master that inspired performers like Led Zeppelin and Eric Clapton, Willie Dixon is IT. Generally laid back tempos support Dixon and his weighty, deep voice to deliver an authentic sense of what its like to get the blues. This CD is great for a Blues / Rock collection or just for some relaxing dinner music."
5,Groove Theory....Groove Reality....,"....like I said, Exclamation Point! It's in my CD as I type this.""When every body's tryin' ta sleep, I'm SOMEwhere making my mid-night creep...""And every mornin' when the rooster crows, he's (it's) telling me it is the time to go... I AM...! The men don't know but the girls understand.""It is the real deal blues."
4,A Fitting Farewell To A Mentor Of The Greats..,"The early 1970's saw the ending of sorts of the rock n roll bluesmakers so influenced by the great sides released by the Chicago Bluesmen of the 1960's..hence if Willie Dixon got some notoriety for his efforts as the fulcrum at this late stage of the game with this fine release of songs done his way not as his ""sons"" such as Muddy Waters.Howlin' Wolf and others did them then so be it...A fitting tribute doing these songs his way.Nice to hear the man wailing on his tracks made popular by the likes of Doors,Led Zeppekin,Cream,Jeff Beck,Stones etc....of course his Chess Box is a must..he was the ""brains"" in more ways than one.The sound is good and typical the style of Chess blues."
3,"I want to like it more than I do, but...","As badly as some of the reviewers have ripped the editorial review above, it actually captured what the weakness of this album actually is. The performance is simply undistinguished. As mentioned by others, Willie worked at Chess Records, writing great songs, producing sessions and playing bass. In those sessions some great versions of these songs were recorded, most notably by Muddy Waters, Howlin Wolf, and Koko Taylor. You can find lots of those on theChess Boxcompliation, which I recommend before this. Yes, Willie was the blues, but these are not the best performances of his songs. Sorry."
1,Not a good review for NET test.,"The NET test was super simple. Basic adding,subtracting,decimals,percentages,fractions, and about 5 basic algebra questions.The reading section was also easy.First a timed minute to see how much you can read in that time, then basic passages and questions about it. Nothing tricky.The rest was about studying styles,test taking skill, ect.This book covers much more information than what you need to pass the exam."
2,"OK book, occasional mistakes","It covers a lot of things, and I liked how things were explained briefly but clearly. However, I found several mistakes in the answer keys and explanations. What if they were something I did not know about before...? I might have tried to memorize the wrong explanations for the exam... But I did score high enough to enter a nursing school."
1,TOO MANY ERRORS!,This test guide has way too many errors! I can't believe that it was ever published. Questions don't match answers and vice versa. The answer descriptions don't even explain the questions. Poorly written.
3,nursing entrance,"I over studied and this book had nothing to do with the hesi entrance exam. FYI find out what kind of test your nursing school offers EX: HESI, TEAS etc."
4,Informative material,"I have only read a few pages, and so far the material that I need for my future exam is available in this book."
2,this book is a waste of money for the PAX LPN exam,This book is a total waste of money if you are studying for the PAX LPN exam. You should buy the review guide for LPN/LVN pre-entrance exam with the CD rom. that is all you need to study for the exam. the nursing school entrance exam book has many errors and just doesn't cut it
5,Kiefer Sutherland continues his role as modern day 007 -- with more style and principles than 007.,"I've heard all the criticisms of 24 Season 6, and I could add some observations not yet printed here. But Kiefer continues to deliver non-stop twists and high energy. In the real world, so many heroes have disappointed us with their flaws and immorality, that ... well ... I just want to continue to believe that Jack Bauer is for real and he really cares more about protecting the USA and our way of life (FREEDOM!) than his own life. Jack Bauer (in my mind) is like 007, with the notable exception that Jack cares about people and principles and values. In the post-911 world, with all it's numerous conspiracy theories, I choose to believe in Jack Bauer. He's like the Duke (John Wayne) with high tech toys (and a purse in season 6!).P.S. Keifer, I am expecting a better plot, more character development, and more kicks in season 7. Please don't disappoint me."
2,weakest 24 season so far,Just finished watching season 6 on DVD. (I live in Europe and it has been out a few weeks already) Dumbest ideas ever in 24. Fox should definetely fire the writers! There got to be more qualified people out there?Don`t buy it. Rather buy season 5 (which was great)
3,Disappointment,"Last season was easily the weakest in the series. Half way through the season, the story line was dropped and a new one added. The writers seemed unsure what they wanted to do with the series. Nevertheless, ""24"" at its weakest is better than most others at their best."
3,Should have been better,"I won't take up to much space here except to say yes season six was disappointing by the standard the show has had in the past and what the audience expects. I agree the show should focus on the action surrounding Jack and how he reacts to it. Since season seven will not start until January of 2009, it should give the writers plenty of time to develop a storyline worthy of praise. I hope the people who produce the show, listen to the fans and come up with a great season seven."
4,An Acceptional Season,"24 season 6 was a very acceptional season. Yes, I do agree that this season wasn't as good as the other 5 seasons but it was good. To all the people that are trashing this season STOP!!!"
1,they shoulda busted outa china,"The end of season five hinted that Jack would have to bust his way out of China. After a season that topped all others, and after a presidential betrayal, where else could they go, but someplace completely new?Instead they decided to play it cheap production-wise and simply resorted to tricks for tricks sake. It seemed like every two weeks, they trotted out a new (old) story line, hoping something would click, and when it didn't they killed some characters. A lot of the storylines went nowhere and were soon forgotten like so many Mexican drug cartels. This show is over. The shark has been jumped, but not before being tortured tooth by tooth for 24 toothless episodes."
1,BIG DISAPPOINTMENT,"I own all 1-5 seasons and love all of them very dearly. Obviously, I couldn't wait to own the 6th season. Sigh... Whoever wrote this season did a very very bad job. I could predict everything, every line, who was guilty, who will do this and that. Also, lines were so cheesy that I could not believe! Usually, I watch this show for 24 hours without sleeping because I can't wait to see what happened after. But 6th season took me over a week to finish because it bored me so much. I only finished it just for the sake of finishing it. I don't know if I should wait for the 7th season now. Very disappointed. But I'll recommend the previous 5 seasons to everyone. Just don't buy the 6th season. Not worth it."
4,24 season six,"THE PRODUCT AND SERVICE WAS GREAT. I'M A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED AS I HAD PREVIOUSLY PURCHASED THE FIRST FIVE SEASONS OF 24. WHEN I RECEIVED MY SEASON SIX SERIES, IT WAS IDENTICAL TO THE 5TH SERIES OF 24. I THOUGHT IT HAD JUST BEEN MIS-PACKAGED, SO I RETURNED IT TO AMAZON. I HAVE TO SAY AMAZON HAS THE BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE AVAILABLE. THEY IMMEDIATELY APOLOGIZED AND PAID THE RETURN SHIPPING AND AGREED TO SEND ME A NEW SERIES, WHICH THEY DID RIGHT AWAY. HOWEVER IT WAS THE SAME AS THE ONE I RETURNED, SO I FELT BAD ABOUT THAT. I STILL DON'T KNOW WHY IT IS THE SAME AS MY SEASON FIVE SHOWS. MAYBE I WILL HAVE TO WAIT FOR SEASON SEVEN. ANY EXPLANATION?THANK YOU, WILLARD MASSINGALE."
5,Action at its best,"Season 6 of the series 24 was one of the best. All the 24 seasons have been great intertainment with lots of excitment. I like the twist and turns the stories take on. Just when you think you have it figured out there is another turn, The actors in this series are the best."
5,not the bets season but still the 24 drama/action,"I am a fan of 24 (maybe my review will no count as other but having all the season this make all my collection very special, this keeps all the 24 drama one of my favorites TV show ever"
5,Will jack Ever Die?,"I have every season of this series. It great watching is on TV. But the season packs offer more and if you lucky get creaper on Ebay or Amazon marketplace sellers. The six offer so much twist in the series. The turnover of the cast like a new show. Only two are left from the original season. If you like Jack Bauer self detroying everything he touch, this season is for you."
3,"Please, find something new!","I've watch all 6 series and this one is the WORST. Where are the writers who gave us those excellent season form 1 to 5?I'm worried about season 7...Too bad, this serie was excellent before this boring season 6."
5,Amazing acting,I love all the 24 seasons. They always get you on the edge of your seat. They always have something up their sleeve.
3,Same Old 24,"You'll like this season if you're a 24 fan. It's basically more of the same.DVD quality is good, but not great. Sound is clear and full.Menus and special feature look unprofessional."
3,Not Great but not bad,"OK, this one is kind of over the top. Jack Bauer comes back from Chinese captivity a broken man. Then he is confronted with a series of terrorist attacks culminating in the explosion of an atomic bomb. The show also has turned somehow more gruesome since we early on see Jack bite the neck and kill one of his captors (Jack as vampire?) and then eventually he will kill one of his friends and torture his brother. His father also turns out to be an enemy. And we get to know this pretty early on in the series. While the performance of Jack Bauer as burned-out is particularly well done at the same time it is distracting and the show suffers from his lack of motivation. There is also an unnecessary emphasis on a multitude of subplots which tend to cause more of a headache and do not contribute to the storyline. That said it is not bad, it is simply not as good as season 5. As other reviewers have noted, the loss of many central characters has also weakened the interest for the series."
3,"Season 6 was the ""Leftovers Season.""","Season 6 of ""24"" was the ""Leftovers Season""--the season in which the writers threw all sorts of plot threads and characters on screen to see which ones stuck. None did. The plot devices were too familiar and peaked too early (I won't reveal how, for those of you who didn't see all of Season 6), the returning characters had nothing new to do, and the new characters lacked screen time for proper development. Kiefer Sutherland was great, as always, and the show still had sufficient momentum to be watchable. But ""must-see TV"" it wasn't. What it was was a waste of both fine returning actors (Mary Lynn Rajskub, Gregory Itzin, Jean Smart, Kim Raver, William Devane, Eric Balfour) and promising new actors (James Cromwell, Rick Schroder). The show's producers promised a radical rethinking of the show for Season 7, but with the ongoing writers' strike, I guess we're going to have to wait a while."
5,Ignore all the negative reviews,"I have never seen any of the previous seasons, so don't have any of the baggage other reviewers seem to have. This is the best television I have ever seen, the casting, acting and plotting is of the highest standard throughout, we kept throwing on more and more episodes till we had to sleep..."
2,24 Season Six,"24 Season Six is not as good as the other seasons. I guess the producers got lost on the track. I felt this one is more violent and senseless, and by the end I can tell they are thinking about Season Seven, but I don't!"
3,Not as captivating as previous seasons,"It's still a good show, but it really wasn't as captivating as previous seasons. I also think that they took a lot of liberties with their ability to stretch reality in day 6."
5,Best Season Yet,"This is probably the best season yet of 24. It is also the scariest as terrorist do things on American soil that are equivalent to September 11-although they do not use images equivalent to what we saw live during 9/11. The opening is a bit diaappointing as there is little information that links season 4 & 5 when Jack is abducted into a Chinese prison. After 2 years in a Chinese prison, Jack is scarred somewhat physically, but he becomes his old self in under a few minutes-very unbelievable. There is also a bit of a stretch between season's as David Palmer's brother Wayne becomes president with no political experience-strictly off his brother's name sake. There are also appearances of ""ghosts"" from the past as people who are supposedly dead return to life... I won't give up the plot line. This is definitely worth watching!"
4,24 Season 6,The box set of 24 Season 6 is what I expected. However I'm glad I didn't buy it just for the Exclusive Special Features disk. That disk is pretty much fluff which adds little to the box set. The main episode disks are great and I am glad I bought them.
4,You can't leave your couch!,I bought this for a friend for Christmas and he loves it. This is one of his favorite series. You can not watch this casually and not get caught up in it. You can't wait for the next scene or DVD to see how it ends.
2,What happened?,"Most of the other reviews here have captured the disappointment of 24 fans. I was, and suppose am still, the kind of fan that forbade anyone to call or interupt me while watching the show. I wanted to be swept up in it and often was. Even though some elements of the show repeated themselves over the seasons, it was still done in a fresh and suspenseful way. The sixth season? It became almost a parody of itself. Too many torture scenes, too much patriotic rhetoric pounded over our heads as justificition for what was happening, too little interpersonal interaction. One of the reasons Season 5 was so good was that we got to see more sides of characters like Buchanan, or the arc Karen Hayes had, or the complex relationships between the Logans. I won't beat a dead horse with more critique, but here's to hoping season 7 will bring back the edge of your seat excitement we all love about the show..."
2,"Worst ""Day"" Ever","This was easily the worst day of 24 ever. The first 4 hours were great (which is why it gets 2 stars and not 1) and the rest of the day seemed to drag on with no real plot devlopment and storylines just being in there for the sake of being there. Another major problem was the lack of great actors that were previously on the show to replaced with hacks such as - Nadia, Doyle, New Palmer (and his sister who is super annoying). The only good actors this season are Jack, Buchanon, and V.P. Daniels (Powers Booth from Sin City and Deadwood).Even if you are a diehard 24 fan skip this season as it is a complete waste. At best watch it for free - it would be a shame to waste money on it."
3,Not the Best,"after five outstanding seasons, number six is pale by comparison with the previous editions of this award winning series. the complexity of the plot/sub-plots seems to take away from the suspense that we have grown to expect. also, things get a little ""far-fetched"" with this story line. they say that a bad day fishing is better than a good day working. a sub-standard 24 is better than most other television programming. jack bauer will always carry a poor script because Americans want what he has to offer - a patriot hero that will do whatever it takes to protect the nation."
2,Save your money,"If you have never seen a season of 24, then maybe you'd like Season Six much more than I did. I've seen much of the story line before, and what is new, I wish I hadn't seen. Did anyone really need a love interest for Cloe? Can you say zero chemistry? The characters are weak, (Jack's dad and brother - really???? Whatever.) It was rarely suspensful - felt like we've been there before- oh wait, Jack escaping, shooting a good guy to help a bad guy and nuke explosion. Yup, been there."
1,I was a fan...,"I'm a hardcore fan, but I was Immensely disappointed with this season. DO NOT waste your money on this garbage! The price is fine as usual on Amazon, but it's the product that sucks! Staya away! You have 5 other good seasons to see."
2,STARTING TO LOSE STEAM,I THINK KIEFER IS GREAT AS WELL AS '24' OF COURSE. I THINK THIS IS A GREAT SHOW UP UNTIL SEASON SIX SORRY TO SAY. THEY BETTER START DOING SOMETHING DIFFERENT OR THEY'RE NOT GOING TO LAST. THE FIRST THING THEY SHOULD DO IS GET OUT OF CALIFORNIA. THE PLACE HAS NO CHARACTER. BEAUTIFUL? YES. CHARACTER? NO! THEY SHOULD START FILMING IN NEW YORK OR CHICAGO. I'M TELLING YOU THE TRUTH.
2,Really Starting to Slip,"What was beginning in season four continues: the inability of the writers to keep the story innovative and exciting. This season made me cringe AGAIN when CTU was attacked AGAIN by terrorists. The new characters are shallow and are horrible actors (with the exception of Milo-though he is technically a season one character returning). The show has run its course and I think should be nearing its end. The writers have killed off every interesting character by this point except Chloe. Watch through season 3 for sure, after that view at your own risk.Here is the order in my humble opinion.Season 3 - best seasonSeason 1Season 2Season 5Season 4Season 6 - worst season"
4,24 on a bad season is better than most other modern shows,"I give Season 4 of ""24"" four stars not rated relative to it's own normal standards, but in comparison to everything else on TV.Simply stated....... even during a weak season like Season 6, ""24"" is still better than most other crap on TV these days.In other words, even at it's worse, ""24"" is better than most modern shows at their best.So many other shows on TV have become simple one trick pony and non-stop sex joke one liners that they have no substance except the cheap laugh.No wonder we now watch very few modern shows outside Court TV crime shows and exist primarily on DVD collections of past shows like........ Cheers, Wings, Silk Stalkings, Seinfeld, etc..etc.."
2,Not gonna buy this season,"This will be the first season not worth buying on DVD. Ultimately it makes me very unhappy to have to break a set, but there wasn't much redeeming about day 6 of 24. They started way too big and just couldn't maintain. Now it sounds like day 7 production is off to a poor start. I don't know maybe this wonderful series just ends at day 5. In any event it was a wonderful ride...."
4,Fast shipping!,24 is one of the best shows on TV. This item was on my husbands xmas list & I almost forgot it. I found it at a great price & it arrived even before the promise date.
5,if you didnt like this then you weren't a true fan anyway,"24 series 6 is superb. You know what to expect with 24, action ctu scmaltz, torture and kiefer sutherland shouting at people to put their guns down. This series was superb as it finally gave us another shot into the torment and pain of the life bauer has had to lead over the years. Tony Almeida is back as a bad guy next time so get in. If you dont like 24 why dont you watch superb tv like 'the unit' the worst thing ever. or heroes which although one of the best t.v series since 24 doesn't look like it has kiefer's momentum of quality. love bauer if you dont dont buy it."
2,Ummm...no.,"OK we get it. LA is the only place terrorists care about , blah blah blah, The twists are mostly predictable, the good characters remain good but the others are getting hard to take. The suspension of disbelief necessary here is almost off the charts - even for this show. Like for example, Jack would be the last person ever to keep any security clearance given his....connections. That is all that I will say. Season 7 better be very good or its time to move on.Or, as my son said, a ""disgusting waste of my life."""
2,I didnt even watch the season finale...,"How bored and disappointed was I with Season 6??? So much so that I didn't watch the season finale. I've been an avid fan of 24 since season 1. I even went out of my way to spread the good news of Jack Bauer to friends and family. Only to be embarrased by this season. I really do hope that next season is better. But I agree with one of the other comments. Everyone that Jack relied on are basically dead, except for annoying Chloe.And WHAT was the deal with bringing the Logans back??? Is Charles dead, did she get put into a mental institution, did Aaron go back to work for the president???What happened with the people that were exposed to the radiation???All I can honestly say is that I hope that Season 7 is good and Season 8 should be kick a** and should DEFINITELY be the last season."
1,Please kill Jack already!,"First, like many of you, I've been a big fan of 24 for a long time. Days 1 and 2 were some of the greatest tv seasons ever, and even on day 5 killing so many important characters the writers of 24 found a way to continue with the show. But now without Tony and just almost nothing to make new, the show has gone old. Please kill Bauer, so we remember only the good days!"
1,"""24 minus 2""",Disc 2 was damaged and we were unable to watch parts of the movie. The seller disclosed there were scratches but that they didn't impair being able to watch the DVD.
1,Over Priced,24 is awesome. Buy season six anywhere but on amazon unless you want to spend twice as much as you need to.
3,24-Season Six,Very dissapointed because I love this serie. Some DVD like # 3 seems incomplete with limited chapters. What you expect to watch by what you read in the guide is not the same quantity of episodes. Apparently there are problems with the DVD's
2,Series starting to be too far fetched!,"I bought the Six Season, and painfully made it through it. I know, why watch it? Because I have been watching it from the beginning and had hope that it would get better. Some of the stuff is getting old...always having a traitor or accused traitor inside CTU, interrogations are always the same, and stuff that is just not believable and way too much backstabbing. And that little grunt noise that Sutherland does, is that part of his character or just him?"
5,24 Day 6 was excellent,"As an avid watcher of 24 since it began in 2001, I have to say that there were some very fine scenes in this season. In disagreement with many critics and fans, the storylines including the family of Jack Bauer allowed Kiefer to show what he can do as an actor. Many of the scenes with Audrey were great as well, and it still held its own in the action category. As with every season, there were tiresome and ridiculous qualities, but with last season being so incredible and so well-received, I think it was just a hard act to follow. But in my opinion, the character of Jack Bauer just keeps evolving and changing, and yet, he still keeps his humanity. I can't wait to see what Day 7 has to show us to top Jack's biting someone to death in the Day 6 premiere. I will never stop watching as long as they keep making it for us!! I just hope the strike is resolved soon, so I can see what's waiting for us!"
1,They Suck!,I received my season 6 in loosly wrapped plastic paper. I am not pleased that a box was NOT RECEIVED. I am a collector of the 24 series and will NOT use this company again.John B. Mason III
2,Least Favorite Season,"I love 24, but season 6 is my least favorite. There were so many parts of this story, and characters that I did not enjoy. So glad the other seasons did not make me feel this way."
4,Missing that uumph!!!,It tied up the loose ends. But just was not it for me. I love some Connie Brisco.Needed more not on fire like P.G. County....
3,Can'tgetenough/Need More!!,"Connie, Connie, Connie...I loved P.G. County, and enjoyed reading about the same characters, I didn't put it down, but I must say that I felt that there was so much more you could've given your faithful readers. I hope there will be a third novel, picking up with Pearl and Patrick...where will their relationship go? Barbara and Bradford, will he stay true to his promises that he made to her at the end of the last chapter? What will happen with Lee and Juliet, they seemed to be about to form a sisterly relationship. Will Patrick grow a backbone? What about the Baroness, why is she there so long without her young, rich husband, shouldn't he call every now and then or come looking for her. Or are they even still married? Please, Connie, give us more!!!!!!"
4,A Good Read.....,"Although I did get a little tired of the expensive designer clothing name dropping throughout the novel, I did find the plot to be interesting. The writer did eventually interwine the different storylines and reach a nice twist and good closure by the end of the story. I don't forsee that there will be a part 3 of this PG County story nor think there should be. She dealt with greed, revenge, lust, divorce and insecurity really well."
3,Much of the same.,"While I typically enjoy anything written by Connie Briscoe, I was left a bit wanting after reading this continuation novel about the folks in PG County Maryland. While it was written in typical Briscoe fashion, much of the unfolding story was a bit too predicatble. I say much and not all yet at the end I was still waiting for the crux of the story to wow me. Still if you are an avid reader or better yet an avid Connie Briscoe fan you may want to read this just to be able to say that you did."
2,More P.G. County - A good read,"I'm an avid reader and I'm alittle disappointed with this one. There's just only so much you can do with the same story line. Knowing the characters was a plus because it really did pick up where PG County ended. I just didn't get ""fed"" like usual. I found myself still looking for a little more when the story ended. Connie can write very well but her other books have been more fulfilling in my opinion. That's all this is !!!!"
4,A Real Page Turner...,"Again, Connie has delivered a great story line which is the sequel to her best selling novel""P.G. County"". Good story telling of greed, jealousy, bitterness, adultry and betrayal. This story will capture your attention and hold it until the very end. Although it's been a while since P.G. County was published, the sequel picks right up where the other book left off and I was able to roll right along with the entire story non-stop. Great writing, great characters and I look forward to her next book."
4,Can't Get Enough,"I Loved the book...first time I have read a novel by Connie Briscoe...it was a page turner. Love the fact it had mature characters than your regular twenty something year olds... it was good reading the life of established people, it got me gripped and hooked on Connie Briscoe novels now"
5,The Saga Continues,"Connie Briscoe won me over years ago with Sisters and Lovers. That book opened with a bang and held me captive. Since then, Briscoe has never failed to deliver a riveting read. I must say that the last two books, P.G. County and the latest, Can't Get Enough, aren't as realistic as her previous books, but they sure are entertaining.Can't Get Enough takes us on a journey with rich and pampered African Americans that the average person doesn't rub shoulders with, but sure loves to read about their glamorous lifestyles.Get this one; it's a page turner."
3,This book was not what I expected,"""Can't get enough"" was a pretty good book, however, it didn't really get me going like ""PG County"". Althoug this book had a good story line, I expect so much more. Connie Briscoe is a very good storyteller and I am one of her biggest fans, I expect this book to be explosive. I expected this book to really wow me. Since the author decided to write a continuation book based on PG County, this book should have be more drama filled. I expected the character Jolene to run into more severe life threatening problems, such as going to jail or even death. Since the author didn't kill any characters in the book makes me believe another series is in the works.I expected the author to include more drastic events regarding Pearl's beauty salon, such as Jolene's daughter being hurt or murdered as a result of her deceitful ways. I thought he book was pretty good, but not as drama filled it should have been."
5,We Couldn't Get Enough!,"This sequel to PG County was a genuine page turner. Although it could stand on its' own, having read the prequel gave us the history and background we used to relate to the characters' strong feelings and actions. We identified the main theme being conflict, but at the end, the word resolution was in order. Reading the personal growth of each character was a good way to ""close"" the drama in Silver Lake (or so we think). Postive or negative, we thought each character reaped what had been sown; in addition, with all of the emotion emitted throughout the book, we could personally connect to the characters in some way. At the end, we couldn't get enough of Mrs. Bentley and all her neighbors in Silver Lake."
3,Not as good as PG County but ok,"While this book is not as good as PG County it was a pretty decent read. I wasn't happy with the way some of the old characters were developed and I wasn't clear about the purpose new resident. I am a big fan of Ms. Briscoe so I really hope that there is a follow up to Can't Get Enough because even though this wasn't my ""favorite"" I can't get enough of Ms. Briscoe's writing."
5,This is the making of a franchise,I really enjoyed this follow-up to PG County. It felt just like a soap opera and I loved every last word of it. I truly hope Ms. Briscoe makes a series of these characters.
4,an interesting reading,"This is a very important work of George Berkeley. On of its most interesting topics is that about the existence of matter. As, for human beings, the ""existence"" of something is related to its perception, there is a very close link between ""things"" and ideas. Both cannot have their existence completely proved. The arguments place the book among the most interesting on the top issues discussed in its time (empiricism, materialism, etc.)"
5,CRY THE BELOVED COUNTRY (cliff notes),"Cliff Notes - CRY, THE BELOVED COUNTRYMy order was received in good condition and a timely manner. Everything went smoothly. I'm pleased. Thanks. Letha Woodring"
1,"Not good because it has no summary, only commentaries!","Most cliff Note books have summaries and commentaries on the chapters, but in this book it only has the commentaries. I like to have the summaries because then I can understand what happened in those chapters better."
1,This book sucked.,"I have just finished this book, and now I feel enlightened, and i will go kill myself now. Thank you for ruining my life Alan Paton!"
1,It was horribly boring but the underlying meaning was okay,"Um, the cliffs notes helped out a lot cause most of this story was too boring to follow without taking a half hour break from it every five minutes. The summaries were good for the parts you skipped over cause you were daydreaming you were doing something else, and the commentaries were most inspirational when it came to class discussion. (Good stuff to bring up)"
1,Bollox,If anyone can show me a worse book I will be amazed. Yes I suppose it had a good message but really he could have done it in a more interesting way. Really George Orwell could do it so why can't he. Anyone feel like chucking rotten eggs at Patons door? Yes I thought so.
1,D.O.A.,"This CPU looked like it was pulled from another computer. The top did not say Pentium 4, it said OEM and was almost impossible to read. One of the pins were bent. If I had paid more than $40 for this I would have demanded my money back. I used my old CPU(because it still worked). My time is worth money, returning it would have cost me twice what I paided for it. If Amazon can get me a refund thanks, if not I will buy tech computer parts for another source that gives a full warranty."
1,Processor Review,"Processor did not work. I wasted time, money and have not been able to get a refund or working processor. Buy at your own risk............"
1,Shameful,Just another author trying to make a buck on FX trading hype...this will be among the thousands of forgotten books of forex trading. I wouldn't buy this book at a garage sale.
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY!,"This ""booklet"" is a complete waste of money. You won't learn anything about Forex. Instead, buy ""4x Made Easy"", and ""Trend Following: How Great Traders Make Millions In Up Or Down Markets"". I simply can't believe this booklet is in print. It's not worth the paper it's written on. SAVE YOUR MONEY and put it to good use elsewhere!"
1,Brutal,"If you've never heard of forex, never traded and lived with your head stuck in the sand since you were born then this is the book for you!Every line is doubled spaced to make the book appear longer than it really is which is short, 96 pages, 82 excluding the glossary. It is the kind of book that a person with no knowledge of forex markets could write within a week and possibly do a better job.In saying this I'm at page 43 and felt so disgusted and ripped off that I felt compelled to write this. Disappointment is not the word.To be fair it's mildly interesting in parts but barely scratches the surface on anything it describes.If you wish to be armed with enough jargon and basics to boldly open a forex account and not have a clue what to do, why look further? ""Forex for Small Speculators"" is the book for you!"
1,Spatracus,"dont buy this book, it is a total joke, takes 2 hours to read, gives some generic info on markets, that has no value to the forex trader.. dont waste money on it. there is tons of free FZorex info on the Internet..."
1,The review by SuperTrader appears to be by the author,There is not enough info in this book to justify the price. Double spaced and about 90 pages. Also the review by super trader appears to be a plug by the author.
1,This book sucks,"The first time I read this booklet I found it to be an OK introduction. Then I read a few pages on a broker's website, and found much more and better information.If you like to waste money on information you can get for free elsewhere, then this book is for you.The booklet has double line spacing to make you think that you actually got something for your money. I believe the author is one of the many people making money on traders instead of making money on trading."
2,forex for small speculators,"Uh, well. It's not about forex for small speculators, but rather the big boogie man and how you'll lose money if you try it. no discussion of trading strategy. fair explanation of terms and history, but frankly assumes someone would know the difference between a put and a call, yet professes to be for the novice. Not hardly worth the time to read, not worth the price."
2,Disappointed,I was somewhat disappointed at the level of understanding the author assumed my knowledge base was on the subject. I also was expecting definite trading strategies to employ. This is not a beginners book and i dont think it helps experienced traders either as the main antidote for succes is keeping a journal practice for one year and dont succumb to greed and fear. There I gave you all the book has to offer and didnt charge you for it
1,The most useless worthless overpriced investment book ever published,"I wholeheartedly agree with all the other reviewers. This p.o.s. is not even worth 1 star. The author uses a large font, wide spacing and empty pages to make this book look bigger than it really is. The author doesn't go into any detail on anything he wrote. There is absolutely nothing of substance in this book. If you go open an account with a Forex dealer, you would likely find more information on his faq page. I returned mine after reading about 10 pages. You can figure out that the other pages are like those first 10 pages. Thank God Amazon has a generous return policy. Leave this p.o.s. on the shelf. If you want a beginner's Forex book,Getting Started in Currency Trading: Winning in Today's Forex Marketby Archer and Bickford is less expensive and at least 50,000 times better!!!There is a 5 star review by Super Trader. You should know that Super Trader is the author, and he gave his own book 5 stars."
2,Broken in less than a week,"My 2 year old daughter loved this set and I thought it was a good deal for the price. However, the stethoscope, her favorite piece of the set, broke within less than a week. One of the ear pieces sheared off when she twisted it. I guess I'll have to get her another (different) one. She's pretty upset about this one being broken."
4,Okay for price,"Researched other ""doctor's"" kits and this one looked like the best deal. Only complaint is that it doesn't come with a doctor's bag. Since I bought it for 2 girls, next time I would pay more and go for the one put out by Disney which probably would've appealed to them more."
2,Made in China,"Cheap, made in China junk. I should have spent a few bucks more and bought a solid set so I don't have to worry about the toxicity. I dropped the ball ordering this one. Kids love vet sets in general but you can do much better than this."
3,CCM Lite AOR/Pop CD,"This Contemporary Christian Music (CCM) Lite AOR CD is from the producer and musician who helped Idle Cure, Liaison and Age Of Faith. It features Dann Huff (Giant), Phil Keaggy, Bob Carlisle (Allies) and John Elefante (Mastedon, The Brave, Guardian). I expected it to be a Hard Rock CCM CD but instead it is Lite AOR. That was a bummer given the session musicians. But it has its highlights like ""The Only Game In Town"", ""Return The Favor"" & ""Take It"". Most of the songs blend together and sound boring. I found myself skipping over most of the tracks. Not the best in the genre but not the worst either. It is getting very hard to find but I would not pay a steep price tag to get it."
4,Tapers off at the end,"The first two-thirds of this short novel are ripe with the foggy atmosphere of Victorian London, as Holmes and Watson seek to help the pretty young client secure her legacy, a trunk filled with stolen jewels. But the thief-murderer duo are apprehended long before the end, and the last part is his rather mundane account of how the jewels were stolen in India and life at the prison on the Andaman Islands. There's actually very little ""mystery"" or detection to it, since we know who the thief-murderer are early on. The boat chase on the Thames is not especially interesting or convincing, nor is the romance between Dr. Watson and the pretty client. What saves this is the almost palpable atmosphere of London in the time of Jack the Ripper, plus the outrageous conclusions drawn by Sherlock Holmes."
4,Great for Sherlock Holmes Fans,Another of A.C. Doyle's story within a story efforts. I found this well worth reading and highly recommend it for all fans of the great detective.
3,Just Okay,The book was just ok. I found it to be quite slow for a Sherlock Holmes book but it was worth purchasing at Amazon and so it gets a 3 star rating from me.
5,Sherlock Holmes wonderful!!!!,Sir Arthur Connan DoyleWhat more can you say about this paramount writer. Its always a pleasure to re read him over and over and over again.
3,The Sign of the Four,"This a classic and an excellent Sherlock Holmes Mystery, I really enjoyed being able to read it using the Kindle App on my LG Spectrum. Price was great also $0.00."
4,Good mystery,"Slightly racist but, those were the times. Fast paced and keeps you guessing till the end. Makes you wonder what is out your window."
5,Excellent Holmes,One of the best stories in the Sherlock Holmes series and full of action. Highly recommended. The scan is not the best but it's great for the price.
4,One of best,"A very interesting story, which almost seems like SACD wanted to write as a non-Holmes story. It has a lot of great action, but the best part is after the story is solved, and we here the entire history of the caper from the ""bad"" guy."
5,whispersync,I used whispersync to read this book. It made the experience very enjoyable. I was able to read as time allowed and do some chores while listening to some parts. Thank you for creating whispersync.
4,Sign of Four,"I enjoyed the story overall. This was my first Kindle book and found it easy to read and operate the device as a whole which is saying alot since I'm not a ""techie"" person."
3,So-so,"I love Holmes, but this novel (the second featuring Holmes) is just so-so for me. The story - a tale of colonial treasure and greed causing mayhem in England - falls flat for me, especially when the action since most of the action takes place in the form of lengthy reminiscences of events long past. There's a little too much Victorian-style exotica/adventure and too little detecting for my taste. Cut away about half the window dressing (preferably the half with the murderous pigmy native and his poison darts) and I'd have enjoyed it a lot more."
2,"Really a dissappointment - no speed dial, scrolling, screen size",I do not understand why so many cordless phones have such small displays. This display is so small that when you go to the caller ID you have to wait for about 10 seconds for the phone to scroll to the phone# !! VERY ANNOYING.Also there is no speed dial. a big negative in my book.
4,Panasonic KX-TG5422M 5.8 GHz DSS Cordless Phone with Dual Handsets,"Good clarity, looks, and battery life. However the reach from the base is not that great, I had a previous Panasonic 2.4 mhz, and the reach was almost 100% better."
1,Dangerously hot battery,"My favorite cordless phone is the Uniden. It was offline for a week while I located a batteries to replace the old ones. In the mean time, I plugged in two different models of these Panasonic phones. This particular model, the KX-TG5422 heated up the battery in both handsets to a level in which it was nearly too hot to touch barehanded. I promptly threw them away. The other Panasonic model...similar, but not same model, seemed to be fine. I may have gotten a bad battery or system (gifted to me). Regardless, I won't be purchasing any Panasonic phones in the future. As I said, I really like the Uniden phones. They fit well in the hand, function properly, last many years and were inexpensive. All reasons why I prefer the Uniden. I just thought it was important to let everyone know that battery malfunction can be dangerous and did occur on this particular model."
3,Great phones but...,"One broke. It just stopped working. Lights up, rings... none of the buttons work. How do you get a replacement? I haven't been able to find one.That's unfortunate. If you want to take a chance that yours won't break, by this. I would have given it 5 stars otherwise."
3,What's so great about 5.8 GHz?,"I bought the phone with the additional handset and it's working well in my office at home, but the 5.8GHz does not travel very far...and I was really wanting it to travel up to another structure on my property. My old AT&T 900 MHz cordless goes the distance. What gives?"
3,NOT A TWO LINE PHONE!,"I had just ordered this phone when I read the review by Terry McArdle. The phone came up on my search for ""Two line cordless phone"", but according to the review, it is only a one line phone and this seems to be confirmed by the detailed specifications. Fortunately, I was able to cancel the order in a timely fashion. The search characteristics need to differentiate 2 lines from 2 handsets."
2,BIG Dissapointment,I bought this phone based on the reviews here and its ability to not interfere with Wifi. The features are great:voicemail alerts and voicemail dialingvarious ringersphonebookcaller id enhanced (see caller id of person even in call waiting mode)speaker phone (a big plus in my book)No Wifi Interference.BUT the biggest problem was the quality of voice. Quality of voice coming in is fine but everyone else heard an echo (like I was in a tunnel) when I called them. Annoyed people enough that I am returning this just after owning it a few days.I replaced it with a Uniden Tru Series and that has been much better. Uniden's sound isn't perfect but its MUCH improved than this Panasonic. The Uniden Series is recommended by TomsNetworking (any networking geek should know this guide and review site) The only feature Uniden really lacks is the multi colored alerts otherwise it matches the panasonic feature for feature
4,Really Fun!,"30 Rock is generally a very hilarious show, and really worth watching. Although there's the occasional inconsistent show that drags a bit, the majority of what you'll see is witty, clever, surprising and a lot of fun. There are many laugh out loud moments.Each of the characters are really well developed and so funny. Every one of the primary actors are so perfectly cast and a pleasure to watch.Bottom line: I highly recommend this series to anyone who wants to enjoy some quality comedy!"
5,Fantastic,"A very strong season and some great extras in this DVD.I have thoroughly enjoyed the commentaries. Very funny and worth buying the DVD for, especially the one with Tina and Jeff her husband. A very funny couple."
4,Show great - Amazon Bad,"This may be the most hilarious episode of 30 Rock yet - really really funny. So I want to download it right away, right? Just like I did on iTunes. But no. I have to download yet another media player (note to programers - enough already!!!). First time, it changes my windows settings. Doesn't work yet, though - I have to download it again. It takes just under an hour to install. And I still do not have the copy of LAST week's episode I bought last night. Will I ever see this week's? Hard to say - it is still not available. Come on Amazon - why couldn't you have used Windows Media Player? Love this tv show - but this is senseless - I subscribed to the season, but I wish I had waitd for the DVDs. I'd be a lot less frustrated."
4,it was great,I received the DVD in a timely fashion and it was in perfect condition. I would definitely buy from them again.
5,Blerg!!!!,"I was introduced to ""30 Rock"" last year, and I was pleasantly surprised that it is extremely funny! The only other time I had seen Tina Fey act was in ""Mean Girls"" (another very funny movie). This is a cleverly written show; I wish the 2nd season was longer, but I believe this was the season of the Writers' Strike, and it ended at an odd point. However, the characters are very entertaining, and the important thing is that you care about a lot of them, even though they are drawn very superficially sometimes. The show pokes fun at everything under the sun, and is a great one to pop into the DVD player on a day when you could really use some laughter and some hot chocolate."
5,Funny,"I love 30 Rock, and will probably buy more seasons as it is something I will watch again and again. Great for sick/hungover days in bed"
4,poor special features,The dvd only has about 6 deleted scenes for the whole season. Compare that to the office that has that many deleted scenes per episode.The commentary only has one person doing the commentary per episode. I much prefer back and forth conversations.NO BLOOPER REEL. The office has about a 25 minute blooper rule and it's the funniest part of the whole season. I don't see how it could have been that much of a hassle to put one on here.
1,Utter Dissapointment,"itunes was easy, accessable and WORKED ON MY MAC! Obviously NBC wants to try and beat apple at the game they will ineviably win. No offense to amazon, you're great for meeting alot of my online shopping needs but a Windows exclusive non-ipod compatable video download might as well be a paper weight to me. BOOOO."
1,Another Great Season,"It's another great season of 30 Rock... almost. Enjoy all 15 episodes... Wait a minute! 15 episodes? That's only 2/3 of a season. Then Why is it full price? Shouldn't it be 2/3 the price, retailing at $29.99 and selling on Amazon at $19.99? What a rip off. They deprive me of eight more episodes of one of my favorite programs, then they try to swindle me by giving me 2/3 of a product."
1,Can't stand to watch,"This is like the Office. I can't stand to watch either. Poor, poor acting. Characters I care nothing about. Equally as bad as Seinfeld.Too bad I have to give any stars at all."
1,Cannot go lower than One Star,I love 30 Rock....Bought two copies of Season 2 and neither work. Have tried all the DVD's on three different machines including the highest rated HD/DVD machine rated by Amazon users which I bought on Amazon and no luck. Did the DVD makers go on strike along with the writers?
4,Preaching the Word: Isaiah,Helps most in understanding the O.T. Text in light of the New Testament. Tends to miss Isaih's vison for community and justice in favor of an individualistic approach to the text.
2,Not Helpful for Preaching,"Unfortunately, after field-testing this volume on an extended study in Isaiah, it offers little to a pastor trying to exegete and give an exposition himself. These are just sermons from Ortlund, not exegetical commentary. In my use of it, it only came in handy trying to find sermon illustrations."
5,Awesome reference by a recognized authroity,"This book is more than your usual bible study aid. Written by Ray Ortlund,PhD, it is filled with the Gospel and offers a deep and quality commentary on Isaiah. If you want a serious review of this prophet's book, this needs to be on your bookshelf.An additional tip. BSF is introducing Isaiah as a new study nest year. Read this this summer for prepartaion for this study."
5,Fun book,Cute story of crocodile that wins the heats of a family and gets to stay...part of a series...looking forward to the others.
3,Indian insight,"Has some good information on the historic detail of the Apache Indians. Does, however, frequently get lost in the political approach in telling what should have been a more personal side of the story."
2,barbie,I found this toy to be a waste of money. It was hard for my five year old to close or put more than two things in it. It says it holds three barbie's and cloths but then how do you close it.
3,Not as good as I expected,"I purchased two of these cases for my daughters, ages 5 and 7, but we were all disappointed with them. It supposedly holds 3 barbies and their accessories, but they are hard to close if you put that much stuff in. They also come apart everytime the girls open them, and they are hard for the girls to put back together. They are good for keeping all the little Barbie accessories out of the way. I just wish they were better quality. A friend of mine has a soft plastic case for her daughter (with a zipper), and she says it is great, but I have not been able to find that item anywhere."
1,barbie soft tote,"I purchase this by the picture inside it shows little closet type places and a bar for hanging clothes, none if this is there, its cute but I would not recommand this procduct. the picture of the inside is false. It's not even close."
1,Barbie Doll Case Not so nice,"I ordered these cases for my grandaughters to store clothes and dolls. They are a very nice size but in my opinion, not even worth 10 dollars (much less 20). The first time I tried to close the case, my hand got pinched. Same fate for my husband. The case is ALL plastic and it would not last very long if at all. The ones I received already had stress points where cracking would eventually happen. The snaps to close and open are plastic, extremely hard to open and just overall a very cheap looking item. I found cases from other toy makers that put Mattell to shame."
1,Glad I didn't buy!,Thanks to those of you who reviewed this..I WON'T waste my money. I too remember the good old days when the clasp was metal and you could load up the case and it stayed shut. I'll stick to plastic tubs that click closed and allow you to see inside. Too bad Barbie/Mattel is missing a great money-maker by going cheap on quality!
4,Very enjoyable,"I can't speak to whether this is a faithful translation or if it is better than other translations, but I enjoyed the Sorrows very much. If you have any interest in ancient Irish folklore and culture, these stories give you interesting tales and a glimpse into past Irish society. There is a very good footnote section as well giving you valuable information about some of the terms and gaelic words used throughout the stories. The writing style is fluid and easy to read and quickly engages you into the story. I enjoyed the second and third tales the best. I liked the first one, but it was a little long and started to repeat itself."
4,Knights Templars and Masonic Knighthood,"This is a reproduction of an earlier text, which you should pick up in the product description. It is almost as if they left room in the margins for notes because the reproduction does not begin to fill up the page.It is told from an insider point of view in that the author is a Mason. The text is organized in chronological and geographical sections. An effort is made to set the stage via sections of history. There are many references to other texts.This is kept from being five stars because: 1) it is not written to the quality of classical literature and 2) the format of the presentation is less than desirable to me.Having said this, I am enjoying reading through the text because I am reading about early Christian history and the pagan and politcal influence that changed events."
5,Cowboy Magic - The best kept secret for coarse & frizzy hair!,"I love this stuff!!! This is a leave-in conditioner that works like a charm. I have frizzy, dry, coarse & thick hair. I have always joked with my friends that I have ""horse hair"". As it turns out, this product is designed for human and horse use.My hair stylist (who has a friend who owns horses) recommended this product to me years ago. I have used it on and off and have always come back. It leaves my hair soft, shiny and very healthy.It is reasonably priced in comparison with other more expensive salon products that (in my experience) do not work as well.[...]Unfortunately for me, I took the time to go to a beauty supply store that was listed on this website as being an official retailer - and they no longer carried it. It was easier for me to purchase it with Amazon. It cost a little more (due to shipping/handling), but gasoline is also expensive!!!"
5,Love this series,I love this series - they're entertaining for kids and adults as well. I always chuckle the first time I read a new-to-me book in the Large family series. They're my daughter's favorite books as well. Get the whole set.
2,"Cute and slim, but doesn't fit","My 13"" MacBook could barely squeeze into the laptop compartment of this bag. I was sad to return it. Your computer must be tiny in order to use this bag."
4,Good GBV style Lo-fi basement rock,Almost as good as the classic album Ponyoak. Many different styles influenced this album. Reminds me of Guided By Voices and Weezer.
4,Soul Samples,"A very warm, individualized account of Dr. Sprinkle's study and experience with the ET phenomenon, which includes scientific data as well as personal stories."
5,The best of the best,"This is the only gravy we use. Whetehr your making regular gravy, or a stew, soup etc. Once you have had this flavor, you will never go back. They also sell the chicken flavor & the brown gravy, but this is by far the BEST.."
4,We shall see,"I bought this as a Christmas present for my dad, but it's winter so he hasn't put it up yet. We don't yet know if it will attract bats and if the bats will control the mosquitos--that's what we're hoping for.What I can say is that I received the product quickly and it was very well-packed for shipping. The seller did a great job. I will also say that the brass detail is very beautiful."
4,"The MXT Edge ""rocks""","I have owned my MXT for 2 years with somewhat sporadic use, and gleaning any really useful operations information from the manual is difficult if not impossible. The MXT Edge not only covers the basics from the manual, but digs layers deeper into the subtle operating characteristics of this highly flexible unit. The manual is organized in a way that makes it easy to pick it up for a ""refresher course"" before you head out when the detector has been sitting in the closet for a few months. I highly recommend this as an addition to an MXT owners bag of tricks. I only wish I had got my hands on this when I got the detector."
2,Totally not as pictured,"This is a total waste. All the crap you dont need, very little of what you do. Its shown with many meds but its really mostly stuff you wont need. I will be returning it promptly and suggest you dont make the same mistake I did."
5,Inspirational,I am a senior citizen and found this book to be very inspirational. It is a fun and easy way to exercise and I am enjoying myself very much besides getting the inspiration I need to improve my physical health and appearance.
5,The freshest guide for the generation that vowed to stay forever young.....,"Baby boomers literally think they're going to die before they get old. It seems they keep redefining each stage of life as they pass through it with undimished exberance. But can they easily bend down and pick up their grandchild? With a chapter devoted to senior citizens this great book is packed with step by step photos, (we might not even need our reading glasses) to improve our core stability, enhance our balance and coordination and excercises to relieve arthritis pain. The user friendly format of the book is a quick read (boomers have short attention spans).....I have bought 10 copies for my boomer friends. We all love it and are in competition for who now is the most flexible. A MUST BUY BOOK.....excellent birthday or holiday gift!"
2,really is for exercise dummies,"if you know absolutely nothing about exercise and fitness, this book would probably be a good one for you, but for someone like me it was a waste. all the moves it illustrated were very basic exercises that i was already familiar with, unfortunately. i guess i should have known that i would need a more advanced book. Also, i wish these books would put more into organizing, like providing tabs to separate each section, so you can quickly flip to what you are looking for."
5,All the information you need.,"My husband brought home an exercise ball several months ago as a gift and we soon realized that it wasn't the right size ball for him, but the perfect size for me. With exercise ball in hand, I was anxious to get started, but had no idea what to do or where to start. This book gave me all the information I needed to utilize my ball and get a great workout! Thank you LaReine Chabut for helping me unravel the mystery of my exercise ball!"
5,It was worth the money,"This book was received on time, it was in good shape, and the content has been a blessing for us. We have learned how to use our Exercise Ball, and the illustrations are easy to follow. I would recommend it to anyone."
2,Disappointed,"After reading the 5 star reviews and having an interest in the subject, I ordered this book. I returned it after looking at it once. I gave it 2 stars as there were 2 artists in the entire book worth studying. Most of the work was done by unknown artists and the quality was poor. I am a painter myself and look for inspiration in the work of other artists. Sadly, I found none here. I wonder if the other reviewers have a connection to the book or own some of the paintings featured."
3,OK,"The item came in a timely fashion. They were larger then expected however. Was hopeing they would be smaller then in the vitamin shop, but they were actually longer and just a tad shorter."
2,No Depth,"I bought this book hoping for an in depth look at using Linux for real-time. The table of contents would lead you to believe that this is the case.Instead I found that it covered this topic only at a very high level. It might be good for an introduction to this topic, but there is very little depth here. For example, the chapter on Linux and Real-time is only 5 pages long! While the description of configuring BlueCat Linux (seems pretty off-topic to me) is 14 pages.Unless you're a newbie to this topic, don't bother."
3,"Catchy, Raw, and Cliche","The best part about this ep is the production. It is produced very raw without any frills. You can tell this from the first hook on the album.Seeing that this is the best part, now we'll move on to the music. Home Grown departs from their humorous, sometimes meaningful, pop-punk to move to a more ""emo"" sound. They still manage to be increadibly catchy and poppy, although one could say they've matured. With this maturation comes the good and the bad. These 6 songs are about relationships, especially those gone sour. This fails as much as it succeeds. While ""Keep Your Distance"" and ""I Was Right About This"" are quite good, both lyrically and musically, songs such as ""Cross Your Heart"" and ""What Would Love Do Now"" are cliche. While you want to connect like you do on Distance and Right About This, the lyrics are too god awful to take seriously.Seeing that this ep is cheap and that half the songs are good, very good, it is a worthy purchase. Just don't expect consistance."
1,Sizes run small,"Despite the sizes being noted as Medium- Men's 7-9, my size 8 1/2 shoe doesn't come close to fitting into it."
3,"noisy, embarassing---but worthwhile??","My husband got me a pair, so I wouldn't have to carry shoes and wear boots on snowy days. They seemed great walking from my car to the office building. But as I walked through the building to my office, all heads turned as I ""galumphed"" through the hall. The overshoes end up being very NOISY, it was embarassing! Might be better to wear boots and carry my shoes. Not sure if I'll keep them!"
5,"""FAN-TABULOUS BOOTS""",FITS GREAT...VERY LIGHT...FITS OVER ALL MY FLAT BOTTOM SHOES JUST PERFECT...I HAVE RECOMMENDED THESE TO MANY OF MY FRIENDS WHO ARE ALSO HAVING A PROBLEM WITH BOOTS NOT FITTING PROPERLY...DON'T CHANGE A THING/KEEP MAKING THESE EXACTLY THE SAME WAY...THEY'RE GREAT!!!!!!!!!
4,Kept my sneakers and pants dry!,"I bought these overshoes to keep my pant legs and sneakers dry in our last storm. The streets by my work seem to flood quite easily, and getting from the parking lot to the office sometimes require hopping over vast puddles. After getting my shoes, socks and pant legs all wet, I got these and they really kept everything dry... The only draw back was that they are very noisy, almost sounds like I was wearing newspaper wrapped around my legs and feet, and they do look a bit awkward. But since I didn't really buy them for fashion, they did what they promised. Next time I might get the NEOS Uptown X which seem a little more stylish."
5,This book has been dramatically improved in the 7th edition,"The book takes the reader progressively from the most simple concepts to the complexities of logistics. It is true that this is not a quantitive book, but it is a very conceptual and didactic logistics book with many cases and graphs. An internet site provided by the publisher with transparencies, internet site references, and other supports to this book makes it an excellent tool. There is a lot of value in the package offered."
2,Leaves much to be desired,This book is used at my college and it is really soft on hard information.It is full of generalizations and impressive industry jargon but offers little practical information to take into industry. The cost does not justify what you get in my opinion. More case examples would be helpful and more analytical methods described with realistic scenarios could really improve it. I would not recommend it unless absolutely necessary.
2,A disappointment,"Since ""Riders"" is my all-time favorite book, I was thrilled to find it had been made into a video. Apparently it's impossible to translate 920 pages of novel onto the screen successfully, even at the length of 3 1/2 hours, which the video was. Perhaps it's because Jilly Cooper's characters as written are so other-wordly, so impossibly handsome or charming or spoiled or WHATEVER, but none of the actors in this movie were at all how I imagined them from the book. The actor playing Rupert especially was a disappointment -- he had none of the easy charm and calculating cruelty that Jilly's Rupert had. I can't recommend this video, but I can suggest you buy the book instead!"
2,Look at Marcus Gilbert but read the book,"The guy who played Rupert was worth the price of the DVD just to look at...drop dead gorgeous...but the movie was a crashing disappointment, obviously filmed by a crew with one hundred percent less than no knowledge of or interest in show jumping. The truncated story line made no sense if one hadn't read the book, and little if you had read it! I was surprised that Jilly Cooper allowed her book to be massacred in this fasion, as Riders is one of the most compellingly readable books I've ever come across...and I DO have knowledge of show jumping."
4,It is very original.,This book has very original approach to the serious field of business. The unique referencing of Noah's Arc make it humorous and fun.
1,Sooooooo Cheesy,"This book was given to me as a gift. I don't know what possessed that person to give me such a foofy piece of reading material, but I was highly offended to say the least. But since I try to keep an open mind, I did try to read it, as skeptical as I was. Turns out my prejudices were right on this one. I actually had to go back and re-read sentences to make sure what I had just read was as ridiculous as I thought.I will most definitely be ""re-gifting"" this to the next person I find that reads below a third grade level."
2,I paid money for this??,"This is totally not what I expected. Divo is inconsistant with his raps. The stories Divo tells on this album are beyond boring. There wasnt anything that grabbed me. Crash was the only meaningful song.The features on this album stand out. If anything positive has come from this, its that I have heard a bunch of new Canadian talent that I am interested in hearing more from.The beats on ""This Iz Bizness"" are tight. I've since went to the Q IT UP website (www.qituprecords.com) and learned that the producer of this album no longer works with Divo ( smart business move on his part )."
1,Cheeezy Emcee,"Divo shouldnt rap. Period! Who can take this guy seriously? If Jack Tripper could rap, this is what it would sound like. The beats were on point. The guest rappers did their job justice (I assume they were paid - Either that or held at gun point). Who writes a song about their gyal gettin blazed by their hype man ? I listen to songs to hear real life ish. I doubt this is real life stuff tho. And if it is, den you even sadder than I thought."
1,Production is what saved the album,Every beat on this LP is solid and very professional sounding.Divo on the other hand shouldnt rap. He ruins every song. The featured artists do the beats justice. Divo's annoying phrases and corny style just gets on your nerves afer about 2 bars of each verse.The producers should pat themselves on the back. Divo should definately not quit his dayjob.Id much rather listen to an instrumental version of this LP.
1,Boooo,"Very disapointed in this product. The beats are all nice. The features emcees are what hold the album together. Divo is extremly outshined on his own album.Even tho the album has real nice beats,and features - I cant give this album any more than 1 star - based on the fact that ""DIVO's"" album would be better off without ""DIVO"" on it.You shouldnt have to rely on everyone else to make your album tight. You should be the main ingredient with everything else being the icing on the cake.Dont quit your day job."
1,Can I Get My Money Back,"I saw a lot of big names on this album and thought it would be worth the buy. Boy was I was wrong. The beats were good and the big guns were good, but Divo does not live up to the features or the production on the album. Something about his voice makes me wanna fast forward the tracks everytime he starts rapping. If this was a solid emcees album with production and features of this calibre, the LP would be a #1 seller for Canadian hip hop. Sorry but I was let down."
1,Ineffective,"So far there is little scientific evidence that saw palmetto actually helps with male prostate problems. In my experience it was totally ineffective in preventing either BPH or prostate cancer. Check with a urologist--most are skeptical, too. Basically saw palmetto has the same effect as a low-grade, weak estrogen dose."
5,my new Ipod holder,What a great product. I've looked around to find something not to expensive to carry my ipod and all the stuff that come's with. This fits the bill nicely. So much so I bought another one for my wife as well. You will love this carring case.
1,Holy Pointy Boobs Batman!,"Wow, this is hands-down the pointiest bra I have tried on. Besides that, the front closure makes a weird crinkly sound. I will be returning it post haste."
2,Can't overcome smell!,"This is the third Playtex bra I've purchased that has an overwhelming smell of rubber in the entire bra. This bra is very comfortable and fits exactly as it should. However, everytime I put it on, I smell the rubbery odor and can't get past that huge drawback. Washing only intensifies the smell. I don't want to waste the purchase price and after owning the bra for 2 weeks, decided to spray cologne on my body (not the bra) to mask most of the smell. I hope nobody else can get a whiff of the offensive smell and think the weird odor is ME! This will be the last Playtex bra I buy. Three strikes and they're out of my life."
4,GREAT BRA,This is the first front closure bra I have found that will support my heavy breasts. Well constructed; padded shoulders; lives up to Playtex standards.
2,Playtex -4695,"Playtex should be ashamed! Fabric is cheap and stiff, lace is cheap and scratchy, only 4 hooks, when there should be 6 or at the miniumum 5. I am not returning, but have passed it on to a friend who ""doesn't care"". I have purchased Playtex forever, but if this is their quality now, then I will no longer purchase any Playtex bra."
2,"Great support, but too much ouch","My chiropractor suggested that I get a bra with more back support and I saw a lot good reviews for this bra. When I received it and put it on, I definitely felt like I was gettin a lot of back support but the cups were so pointy that I looked like I was wearing cones for a bra! The bottom of the fastening strip kept coming apart and because it's made with a thick and stick material, it was rubbing my skin so hard that it was raw. If it wasn't for the cup issue and my skin being rubbed raw, I would like this bra a lot!"
3,Hign in front,"Bra fits and feels fine. The only issue is that it is full coverage plus more bra. Bra is higher than majority of my shirts. It is fine for turtlenecks, very high shirts."
4,Good choice if hooking a bra in back is painful and cumbersome,"I had difficulty finding a front close bra locally. I found the Playtex front close bra online and bought it through Amazon.It's a quality bra and the front hook closure is not as bulky and intrusive as several sports bras i have. Top sections of the straps are padded and wider, which makes for more comfort and less slipping off the shoulder.I recommend it."
3,Cons to Front Closure Bras in Large Sizes,"I was disappointed that it had only one set of eyelets for front closure. So one cannot adjust the fit as with bras with back closures.For this large size bra, I am also finding difficulty in closing the numerous eyelets after I bring the cups together. However, once the ordeal of wearing it is over, the shape and fit are great."
5,front close flex back bra,"Finally a wonderful fitting bra for a full figureNo more hanking down the backPlaytex Women's Front Close with Flex Back Bra #4695B. Nice support and a nice comfy fit. Helps that I finally figured out the correct bra size, smaller band and a bigger cup.Only one thing would improve this bra and that is to make the padding on the straps much longer to go further over my shoulders otherwise THANK YOU.....SincerelyKatie B"
2,Mis marked.,My wife said they were not even.close to.being the correct size. They were marked with her size but actually several to large. Very disappointing.
5,playtex front close bra,"great bra! I would recommend this bra for anyone who is a plus size and is dealing with arthritis. I have always worn a wired bra and found it was difficult to wear a wirefree bra. I didn't feel there was enough support in a wirefree. However, this particular bra is great!"
2,Very uncomfortable,"I am finding that Platex bras no longer are comfortable or are their sizes exact. I had been so happy with them in the past and did not mind paying a higher price for comfort and style, but no more. This bra was the most uncomfortable I have ever worn and gave it away soon after it arrived. Like so many products made today I find Playtex disappointing. Wearing another brand and love them."
2,Runs large,"This bra is not for the younger generation and was not attractive. It runs big and gives you the ""cone"" look. Had to return it."
3,still deciding,not really sure as of yet whether I like or not....so far it is ok...waiting to see how it holds up after several washings.
3,Cushion hooks better,The hooks on bras are all two thinly covered and can become painful. These are no better or worse than norma.
5,bra,It was shipped on time...and I love it very comfortable thank you very much .I will be buying more of the bras in the near future
5,Playtex Women's Front Close with Flex Back Bra,"I highly recomend Playtex brand Front Close, because this bra holds you firm, where you don't have too worry about your front falling out when you bend over to clean or do chores. If you line hang these after washing, they will stay in shape and last a very long time. I have purchased these over the last several years and love these bras."
5,Playtex Front Close Bra,"This bra is sooooo comfortable, I actually went back and ordered more. The fit is perfect and it doesn't cost an arm and a leg to buy one. This will be the only bra (brand) I buy from now on."
3,Had to try it!,"I had never had a front closure bra, but had always thought it would be a good idea. Once I got it on, it fit well, but it was just kind of a hassle to put it on. Seems like it should be simpler....not. My boobs got in the way. It may be just fine for smaller women, but I am going to continue hooking and rotating. All in all, it is a well-made Playtex product, and comfortable once on."
5,Best Bra Ever,I first bought this bra in an outlet store in the States (I'm Canadian)But it's hard to find here and VERY expensive ($45.+) The support it gives on the sides and back is great and the front closure is fabulous for arthritis shoulders and hands!Buying on Amazon is a good bargain!
5,Playtex 18-hour bra,I had used this bra before so I knew just what I was getting. ThanksThis is the only bra that doesn't rub my back. The fit is excellent and very comfortableto wear all day.
3,"Nice bra, but","When I ordered this bra it was listed under Mastecomy bras. I liked the way it looked and the fact it had the front opening, but when I got it, it was not what I thought I had ordered. It was a regular bra and that's the only reason I sent it back."
4,So comfortable!,"It's not easy getting bras that fit comfortably, especially at my size. This is one of the comfiest I've found."
3,Front Closure bra - not a total bust.,"I had just had open heart surgery & was looking for a front closure bra that was comfortable (no wires). The bra is sturdy & well made but the material was a little to stiff and rubbed on my incision at the bottom of the hook & eye closures. Also, the design will help improve your posture. The back of the bra is nice & sturdy & discourages slouching."
2,Multiple complaints...,"The straps are so thick on this bra that I don't own a single shirt that I can wear it under where the straps don't show by my neck. It's unwearable for this fact by itself. It's also not true to fit. I bought a 38DD and it is very, very tight under my breasts. It also makes ""the girls"" look very pointy.I bought this bra for back support since I have been having middle back pain recently and it doesn't seem to be any more supportive than a cheap bra from Target."
1,Not comfortable and hard to get on.,I purchased this hoping ir would be easier to get on because of my arthritis. It actually is harder and th elastic does not give very much. I find I don't wear it.
5,ok,"me gustó mucho el producto y llego a tiempo , según lo acordado y comprado, gracias por el servicio. pilar"
4,comfort and support,As you age it is harder to put on the conventional bras. This one is easy to slip on and clip in the front. It also provides good shoulder support and proper lift.
4,I like this style very much.,"Do to mobility problems I like the front close bra. Most of the stores around here stopped carring this style. I was happy to find them on line, and will be ordering more. Thank you"
1,Very Disappointing product,"I have enjoyed Playtex products in the past, but this product was a big disappointment. The bra was actually too tight and normally Playtex runs true to size. When removed the product by the end of the day, actually had cuts where the bra had dug into skin and broke the skin. DO NOT BUY."
5,I actually have a figure!,I have to wear front closure bras and most dont offer support unless u have underwire HATE IT! so the bras I've been wearing either give me uni- boob or they just sag. This bra actually give me breasts. I have a figure! My shirts poke out now! The straps on this are wide and comfortable. I don't find where anything is itchy like some of the others talked about. I just love it! I am older and this closes easy also. I would recommend this to any women who wants to get her figure BACK!
4,Perfect support,"I'm 36DD bought this while nursing as my breasts r heavy all of the time. They r true to size, give great support and I received product in no time. The do make the breasts look a bit pointy but they do the job. I would say they have a minimizing effect too."
5,Wonderful fitted Bra,"I bought this bra for my daughter. The bra fits wonderfully on her. The bra gives her a wonderful shape, slims her down, lifts her up, and gives her some support with the flex back material. I would buy this product in other colors."
3,"Extremely weird shape, but supportive.","When I tried on this bra I almost threw it away immediately. The shape was horrible. Maybe because I'm a DDD and it holds everything up. I ended up with very pointy ""out there"" boobs. My 7 year old asked me why my boobs looked weird without knowing I had a new bra on. However after seeing how supportive it is and how comfortable I decided to use it when I go jogging. It's better than any sports bra I've bought."
5,Awesome,I purchased this product for a elderly woman and these bras have the best support she waited a long time to find a bra she like thanks to amazon she received them in 3 day .i had trouble getting them from sears online they use a outside company .amazon was so much cheaper and much more efficient . Thanks amzon
2,Last time I beleive reviews...,"I should've known better, because I've had issues with Playtex bras before -- I had to order one band size up for it it fit. It did fit -- good coverage, soft. I had it on 10 minutes and had to take it off. The arm pit area is too high up. I hate that. It feels like you're stuffed. I can't honestly believe anyone likes that feeling. I have crossed Playtex off my list forever and will stick with Glamorize bras. I just wanted to try something different...lol Not recommended. I'm a large lady...hard to find sizes that support and fit well -- that are COMFORTABLE. The girls were hoisted up enough, but I was not a happy camper. Off to the charity bag it goes."
5,Playtex Bra,Fantastic product gives great support and very comfortable to wear i am usually an F and when order got the DDD and it fits perfect will definately be re ordering i got 2 bra's for less than i would usually of paid for one..great product..great price...
3,"It is OK, can still learn something","This is a recorded performance of Nadia. It is not intended to teach a beginner, but is is nice to watch if you are an intermediate to advanced dancer, you could still learn a few combinations. Nice entertainment!!!"
4,Very Good,"'Housefire' was originally released in 1985 but went fairly unnoticed and quickly went out of print, until Bullseye Records re-released it onto CD, and we can thank then for that. It is a fine showcase for Byther Smith's talent, and while it may not be as solid as some of his other albums, it is very fine none-the-less. All but one song is an original, a stinging cover of Detroit Junior's ""Money Tree"" which opens the CD. The rest are all Smiity's own, and showcase his very intense style. With song titles like ""The Man Want's me Dead"", you know he means business. Even the instrumental ""Knockdown"" has a powerful driving force to it that grab's your attention quickly. ""Live on and Sing the Blues"" is one of the most powerful slow blues I have heard in a while and you believe Smitty that he has lived the blues life when you hear him.""Housefire"" may not be as good as the recently re-released 'Hold That Train', but it is still a fine album of blues that any fan of Byther Smith's must have."
4,Do you want to learn the correct way to play baseball???,"Pete Rose is one of the greatest baseball players. In this book he will teach you how to be a good all around baseball player. He explains how to play every position correctly. It is important to practice too and he preaches that. If you can switch hit he believes that it is a great advantage to you and gives good reason why. Don Gullett, who was a pitcher for the Cincinnati Reds, teaches you how to pitch. He shows how to throw certain pitches and how to take care of your arm. Practically anything that you would want or need to know about how to play baseball correctly is in this book.I would recommend this book to all young players and any coach because it is a really good book for showing you how to play and practice. If you like baseball then this book would probably interest you. I liked it because it helped me understand the game better and how to play and practice better."
3,Weird taste and texture,I had been using Sprouts b12 drops and had been fine with them but decided to try these and it was a bigger bottle for less. The taste and texture are very different and hard to get used too. I have taken lots of homeopathic and other drops before and these are quite different. I will use them but will not buy again.
5,Get a Lift ...,"... in your ""git along"". This Liquid B-12 is a great start. I love the liquid aspect because the vitamin(s) get into ones systems faster and are fully used. Tablets, about half really get used because a body's system can't dissolve them as easily. The rest are expelled from the body. There goes half the money you spent to get your supplements. These days we cannot afford to throw ANY money away, no matter what form. So ... the liquid form of vitamins are the best way to go. No waste!!! This is an AWESOME product, and no needles! I'm not a Dr. but liquid form is a great alternative for the needle, especially when you can't get to your Dr. right away."
2,Taste.,"The taste is horrible. And even after you try to wash it down with juice or water, the taste lingers. I will stick to pills."
5,Ultra B12,"I bought this for my granddaughter. We had great results. She doesn't care for the flavor, but that is not unexpected. I will continue to buy this product on a regular basis."
1,Upped my anxiety and gave me panic attacks,"This product was terrible - I have had night sweats and panic attacks for about 2 weeks now. After marking off the other supplements I take on a daily basis, this one was still causing me problems. I stopped taking it today, and feel incredibly more relaxed, and not anxious at all. I was getting worried I had major issues, but have now figured out that this product is worthless. Get you B12 someplace else...5000mcg per dosage is WAY to much, and I've read online today that my symptons are textbook B12 overdose. I would never in 1 million years buy this piece of junk again...at least I will sleep good tonight :D"
2,A little worried..,"I'm worried about this product containing ""brown rice syrup"". The problem is that rice used to make brown rice syrup is typically grown in regions where arsenic pesticides were heavily used before the EPA banned them in 2009. And while these pesticides are no longer used, their toxic residue is still lurking in the soil where our food is grown. I'd like to know how much arsenic is in this product or would rather it not have brown rice syrup in the product at all. If the amounts are low or none, I'd love to make this a more positive review."
1,"Red, stinky, and gross! Also has carbs!","This stuff is just plain gross. I can't even get past the smell of it, or the bright red (obviously artificial) color of it. And, you have to take a full TEASPOON of it! I tried to keep it in my mouth for 30 seconds, and made it about 5 before gagging and spitting it out! The container leaks while standing up too, so if you don't want anything stained bright red, put it into a bag or something. Being on Atkins, I needed a ""pick me up"" vitamin, and this is not it. Has 2 carbs per teaspoon, which likely means SUGAR...which is not listed in the ingredients. I threw this in the trash after one try. Don't waste your money. YUCK YUCK YUCK!!!"
5,They are a must have!,"I take them 3 times a day- 2drops at a time. I am so much more productive and energetic! I tell everyone about how much they have helped me get motivated to go to the gym, clean my house and some days just get out of bed! They don't have the best taste but what vitamins do??? I find the best thing to get the taste out of my mouth is to drink a Coke Zero or green tea- anything but milk and water should do the trick as well. I am afraid to try another brand because I am sooooo happy with the results I get from these. I only gave 2 stars on my first review b/c I couldn't get past the taste but the more I used them the more I found I didn't care how they tasted b/c the results were worth it!! And after a few uses I got used to the taste and they don't bother me as much!! They really don't taste bad just not great!!!"
1,Gave me a headache,"This gave me a headache, unfortunately. I figure it may be the xylitol, but I'm not sure. In any case, I ended up unable to use it. Douglas Laboratories makes a B12 liquid without any artificial sweeteners, so I'm using that now without any problem."
3,"Gossip, Gossip, Gossip","It isn't mandatory that you watch Peyton Place before Return To Peyton Place as the actors are different and some of the characters did not reappear in the sequel. I watched both back to back and Return To... was just as glossy, trashy and colourfully slick as its predecessor. With a story like this, taking place in a small town full of characters, there are more than enough stories to interweave. The audio commentary of Sylvia Stoddard is a great supplement to this dvd. (see also The Best of Everything) She related stories about Tuesday Weld, Mary Astor and Grace Metalious among many others. This is a well-produced melodrama and I recommend it on that basis."
4,Pop some corn and curl up on the couch---,"Okay, so it is VERY different from the original PEYTON PLACE, but so was the book! Carol Lynley and Tuesday Weld are gorgeous, adorable and totally enjoyable. Eleanor Parker and Mary Astor are campier than a couple of drag queens. It is kitschy, early 60s soap opera at is best. This should be playing in revival houses as a double bill with the original. Watch for Bob Crane in a cameo role as a talk show sidekick.Enjoyable commentary by film historian, original theatrical trailer and 2 short movie-tone news reels are fun special features, but it's a pity that Lynley wasn't invited to do a track with her own remembrances...she has great anecdotes!Beautifully preserved soap fest, best when viewed as a double feature with the original PEYTON PLACE."
3,An average sequel,"""Return To Peyton Place"" is an adequate follow-up to one of thebest soap operas in Hollywood history.The story is not as good,and the performances are average even for this kind of film.Thebest thing about the movie is Mary Astor in a brilliant performance as the Mother From Hell,who finally gets hercomeuppance.Overall,this is a routine but satisfying sequelworth watching."
5,An oldie but goodie,"I am happy to relive my childhood movie memories. Peyton Place really captures what life is in a small town USA. Definately a ""chick Flick"""
5,return to peyton place,this is a continuing story from the 1957 picture of peyton place so anyone out there who likes a great story inpicture should purchase them both and good luck im sure who ever buys them wont regret doing so great stuff
2,Yawn,"Alison MacKenzie (this time played by Carol Lynley) lands a book deal, which takes her away from Peyton Place to hobnob with a big-time New York publisher (Jeff Chandler). When her thinly veiled account of the townspeople is released, she finds herself drawn back to her hometown to face the consequences.The first film was nothing much, and this one is even less so. Just a humdrum soap opera with little energy in either the performances or the direction by Jose Ferrer."
3,"Creepy mutterings, groans and grunts","I purchased this CD because one of its melodies was used in a video of Ansuya's dancing instruction. I would have liked many of the melodies on the CD, but the wordless grunts, groans, and mutterings in the background sounded creepy to me and spoiled the music for me."
3,Don't get the express shipping,"Although the item that I had purchased was good, I made the mistake of paying extra for expedient delivery. This was not only a waste of money but after 5 business days and I had not received my order I felt ripped off. I am unsure at this time if I will ever order ANYTHING from Amazon again."
4,fair retelling of the tale,"Coppola's telling of Bram Stoker's classic tale is a rather good one, at least compared to many of the vampire movies out there. It does have a gothic or romantic feel to it. Gary Oldman, Winona Ryder, Anthony Hopkins, and Tom Waits all put in great performances (especially Waits). Not surprisingly Keanu Reeves puts in a particularly dismal performance. He has that tendancy. What was surprising was Cary Elwes performance. Elwes is a wonderful actor, but his work in this film was sub par. What I found particularly disapointing was that there were no special features on this dvd. It would have been nice for Coppola to have had a commentary track. But there is still the film."
2,"Why call it ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" when it wasn't?","You may like this film if you never read the book and want an Anne Rice sexy-vampire, but if that's the case WHY DID THEY USE BRAM STOKER'S NAME IN THE TITLE? His Dracula was EVIL, and Mina NEVER fell in love with him, not even remotely! And the book was really scary, whereas this pathetic Dracula lost me completely in that scene where he cried after Mina stood-him-up on their dinner date. Dracula? Sobbing? Give me a break!"
1,follows the book - but the book sucked (heh heh),"If you liked the book, you'll probably like this movie. However, if you agree with me and think the book was boring, then don't bother with this film."
1,"Horrible, except for Gary","This film disgusted me. The way the vampires are portrayed, so ugly and unfeeling, repulsed me. (For a look at some beautiful vampires, check out Interview with the Vampire). There was far too much reddness and fog in the sky in Transylvania. The visual effect is that of a low-budget sci-fi flick. If Amazon had half ratings (which, they don't, so too bad), I'd give it one and a half stars for Gary Oldman, who can portray a tortured lover like no other (see Immortal Beloved and The Scarlet Letter). Wynona Ryder isn't too bad in this film, but I've seen much better from her."
2,what was coppola thinking?????,"What was coppola thinking when he cast Reeves, you can see that his british accent is artificial everytime he opens his mouth.The most annnoying thing about the movie was the sets, it would make one think this was a B-movie or something.The one thing i didn't get was that part where 2 women start kissing for no reason!!!"
1,Awful,"This plodding movie makes a dog's breakfast out of the original book. Either FFC should have ventured to tell his own Dracula story, or he should have stuck with the book, but what he does here is mess up the plot so badly that anyone who has read the original book cannot help but chuckle. He also completely contrives a relationship between Dracula and Mina (not in the book) and makes everything very sexual (esp. Lucy). Do we have to see her nipples every chance FFC gets? Keanu Reeves is awful too. It's a bad product....."
2,A Perverted Lab Experiment,"... You people that have rated this film 5 stars need your heads examined. Yes, I do agree with the fantastic color,the special effects, breathtaking costumes,the surround sound effects, but what else is there for peep sake!!. The story is twisted, girls are getting raped by Satan himself, Winona Ryder and Keanu Reeves acting is out of place. The only person that fits in this movie is anthony Hopkins, at least his british accent is authentic. This movie is so twisted that even Count Dracul looks like he belongs in one of the Star War films and not to mention Dracula's slave who craves insects and cats.Not only is this film offensive, but a tremendous dissapointment to all Dracula film lovers."
1,"No mommy, not that one!","This is truly HORRIBLE AND EMBARRASING TO BRAM STOKER! It absolutely stunk! Dracula is a blood sucking vampire not a romantic gentleman! If you want a truly errie, and a classical movie get the Bela Lugosi version from 1931. They knew true horror then!"
3,"Visually, a pretty stunning film.","That's what most of the 3 stars are for; the effects, the scope, etc. were exceptionally well-done. The direction was impressive even for Coppola. The story ... well, it veered pretty far from the book, but hey; what Dracula film hasn't? It was still interesting with some intriguing touches. The acting? Oldman was terrific. Hopkins was very good. Tom Waits was surprisingly effective. Everyone else, and I mean EVERYONE, was pretty much useless. Reeves was almost at his very worst, and considering how limited he is anyway, that says a lot. Ryder, as usual, was totally pathetic. I'ne never understood why she ever made it in films at all. She has ZERO talent, and doesn't even look all that great. The rest of the actors were plug-ins that could've been played by almost anyone.Worth watching for the visuals, but nothing you'd watch over and over unless you're a hardcore Oldman fan"
1,An atrocity,"This movie is horrible. This is one of my favorite books and FFC ruined it. The whole ruination comes from the ""love story."" Dracula is an evil presence who feeds off of innocence or innocents (whichever you prefer), not a doomed lover. I say shame on FFC for adding a subplot that does not belong. I wish I could give it zero stars."
3,"So ""DEEP""","it may seem boring but going through its story,soon you realize its not that scary it may have some horror scenes but it really focuses at winona and gary oldmans role,if this wasnt a little scary you may see its dramatically romantic.one more thing is that it has so many scenes where blood explodes that usually it is obvius that it was only placed on a bucket and threw it fast on action.even lucy's blood puking looks like she has a hose in it."
2,A SO_SO MOVIE THAT COULD'VE BEEN A REAL CLASSIC.,I saw DRACULA and afterwards I felt letdown about it. Having seen BELA LUGOSI'S version I was hoping it would be like that unfortunatley it wasn't and here's why I think it wasn't as good as the above. I found that KEANU REEVES and WYNONNA RYDER to be miscast in thier respective roles who they play I won't say just watch and see what I mean. Also I found GARY OLDMAN to be a little weak as DRACULA in his potrayl he didn't seem to scare me at all. The only person who I feel saves this film is ANTHONY HOPKINS who's great in his role who he plays I won't say but I'm sure you'll agree So all in all I can't recommend DRACULA.
3,Unfortunate casting choice just ruins the whole flick,"All right - you're a casting director, and you've assembled this amazing group of actors: Sir Anthony Hopkins, Gary Oldman, and Winona Ryder among them.And into this fray you through in Keanu?no no no no no no no! Bad dog! No Milkbone! (TM)I've never heard Costner's infamously bad English accent, but I'm sure Keanu's (I won't even dignify him by his last name) was pretty comparable.And the man simply cannot act. Not in a box, not with a fox. Not in a hat, not on a cat. Not in shirt, dang, it just hurt!It's the classic ""weak link in the chain."" Altogether, this was a brilliantly executed film(although some section didn't mesh well with others), but Keanu?If I want to see him at his peak (which is never), I'll go find ""Bill and Ted."""
2,"Oldman, actore extraordinare, was the only saving grace..","Although the acting in this movie was superb on Oldman and Ryder's parts(and even w/ Keanu Reeves at some points), the movie did absolutely too little justice to the novel itself. The cinematography, in an attempt to be spooky and ominous, ended up being cheezy and overdramatic. Dracula was done MUCH better by Lugosi in...'54, was it?..All in all the movie flat out STUNK."
2,Dracula: PoMo Version!,"First off, the extra star is for even attempting to make a vampire movie, which people don't do enough of. That being said, I don't know how this ludicrous dud of a movie received 82% positive reviews on Rotten Tomatoes, but I can only surmise that free alcohol was provided at the advance screening. Critics praised it as 'unique' and 'lavish', when what they really should have said was 'tactless' and 'gaudy'. The costumes and sets are ridiculous, including a papal length robe for Dracula and hair that can only be described as a twin mohawk afro. Keanau Reeves provides the final insult, delivering all his lines with what must be the first surfer dude inflected Southern English accent. Anyone expecting a faithful, gothic style adaptation is in for nearly 3 hours of bitterness. Unique indeed!"
3,A great collector's edition? Don't Count on it!,"Is it a crucifix that causes Dracula to shield is face on the box art or is it shame knowing that this lack-luster collector's edition sucks more than he ever could?Among the problems are: a dark film transfer, deleted scenes so grainy they look as if they were transferred from a bootleg VHS, and finally, a director's commentary that feels too simplistic for such a complex and stlyized retelling (meat and potatoes stuff - ""I read Dracula as a kid, My brother did the title effects, ect."")One a ray of sunlight is the documentary about Eiko Ishioka, the designer who gave the film its fantastic imagery."
2,Way too Hollywood,"I had originally purchased the video in 1995 and purchased the novel the following year. After reading the novel, I tried to watching the video again and was very disappointed. The ""romantic"" scene with Mina and Dracula was so cheesy that I had to fast forward through it. This can't be what Bram Stoker envisioned."
3,Terrible Dracula movie makes great drinking game!,"This poor rendition of Dracula is so flawed, disjointed and obtuse that were it not for its MST3K-ability it would make a good target for plinking.However the movie can be highly enjoyable as a drinking game.Rules:Every time Keanu Reeves butchers his English ""accent"" take a drink.Ditto Winona Ryder.Each time the plot inexplicably changes take a drink.If you can figure out why Ted is in Transylvania instead of Redfield like it's supposed to be in the book take two drinks.Each time Keanu Reeves stares blankly take a drink.Ditto Winona Ryder.Every time Dracula changes his form take a drink. (there are about 20 of them)Breast shot? Take a drink.Every time you get confused by what's going on take a drink.Bonus points for:Figuring out the chase sequence at the end of the movie. Say what?Figuring out what the heck Keanu Reeves' last line means.Be sure to drink beer or you won't get through the first half hour.See? Movies can be fun."
4,stylistic flourishes abound......,"Francis Ford Coppola's 'Dracula' failed to leave a positive impression after my initial encounter. However, subsequent viewings forced me to alter my previous opinion. This modern rendition of a 'classic literary myth' is sumptuously designed and effectively utilizes just about every 'stylistic flourish' imaginable. Many fanatics of the original novel will be quite disheartened by this modern update but film buffs will enjoy it's innovative theatrical style. The castle sequences are beautifully rendered possessing a sense of morbidity and terror though out it's duration. Highly recommended."
4,For what it is worth-,"You have to love this movie. The only reason to not like it is the rediculous and pathetic Keanu. What a waste of time this guy is. My dirty socks could act better than he can. Go to school and learn your craft you wastoid.If you can get past Mr. thespian there, you will see a strange but unique version of the original book. If you can even call it a ""version"". Many of the actors are excellent. The story is paced well, and I don't ever recall a more artistic approach to film making. There are sceans that just stay with you. The film is oddly romantic, I can see why under a spell Mina would go for this guy. Yet he is still a foul creature from hell, and Gary Oldmann portrays both sides of Dracula with perfection. Excellent musical score. I just wish there were some extra features on this DVD. Because of that I have to knock it down a peg."
4,best modern Dracula,"This is the best modern Dracula I've seen. Most are funny, not scary. This is sexy. It's got intrique, and it blends old world/ new world flavor seamlessly."
5,A Gothic Extravaganza That Has It All.,"I recently went to Blockbuster and rented Bram Stoker's Dracula because, as a small child, I had seem commercials for it and had always wanted to see it to know just how terrifying it really was. Well, I was totally blown away by every aspect of this movie. The performances by the actors as well as the cinematography and special effects were spectacular. The script remains ever-so-true to the novel by Bram Stoker, and the resulting performance of Dracula, as played by Gary Oldman, is nothing short of amazing and horrifying. The ending of this movie will move most sentimental people to tears, as well as make them look out the window as they go to bed. The DVD has no special features, but the image and sound quality of this DVD is truly wonderful, full of vibrant colors and dynamic sound. Rent it, buy it, it is one of the best."
2,Blu Ray picture quality is mediocre,"I am only going to comment on my opinion of the Blu Ray picture qualityrelative to other Blu Rays I have seen.I have watched about 30 Blu Ray disks so far on my 1080P SONY 40 inchLCD screen using a Sony Blu Ray player. This movie seems to be one of the poorest so far.Some of the best I have seen include Curse of the Golden Flower,the 2nd Blu Ray release of The Fifth Element and even Blazing Saddles."
3,"Not Bram Stoker's, But still a fun movie to watch!","I give it three and a half stars.The other reviewers here are absolutely correct. This should NOT have been called ""Bram Stoker's"" Dracula. If you are looking for a faithful screen adaptation of the novel, this is not it. Another point I agree with is that Keanu Reeves AND Winona Ryder's English accents were laughable at best. But, If you are looking for a visually rich and charmingly campy bit of fun, this is your movie. It seems to me that Francis Ford Coppola really loved (as I do) the old horror movies from the 1930's and set out to pay homage to them. I think Gary Oldman does a smashing job of playing Dracula. You could tell he was really having a ball with this part. Flaws aside, this movie is thoroughly enjoyable and fun to watch. I didn't regret purchasing this movie in the least."
2,worst blu ray transfer ever,"Good film but it is a shoe in for the prize of worst blu-ray transfer ever.Total garbage picture quality. If you have the dvd you don't need this. Whoever was in charge of transfering this to blu-ray should never be allowed to do so again.Colors are off, image detail is non existant and blacks are crushed to the point they have little to do with actually being black."
4,VELCOME to the Carpathianssssss,"The best Dracula move to date!!! Only downside is that stiff Keanu Reeves... everytime he spoke it made me cringe. Apart from this major downer, the film still overcomes this barrier with a dark, well scripted and directed interpretation by Francis Ford Coppola.Obviously Gary Oldman had a better dialogue coach than Keanu, mastering his transilvanian accent to capture the anguish, sorrow and pain that Dracula carried with him over the centuries. Without Oldman this movie would have been a surefire flop.Coppola has remained true to the book and has created an atmospheric and visual masterpiece, but maybe should have spent some time with his choice in actors. The Region 2 DVD has a Documentary, Trailers and Costume Designs. 'Vhat sweet music vey make.' Enjoy!"
2,"Great visuals, great Waites, mediocre eveything else...","I always feel like I'm watching a documentary on life in the Hollywood Hills when I see this film. Everything about it is either way overdone (the effects, the histrionics, the makeup) or way way way underdone (Reeves & Ryder performances). Ultimately this movie doesn't hold a candle to Werner Herzog's matchlessly brilliant & much creepier Nosferatu (with Klaus Kinski's sublime definitive performance)."
1,Pitiful horror film,I'm surprised this film had such a huge outing at the box office and on tape. It was the second best selling horror film of 1992 behind only Army of Darkness. I would suggest you skip Dracula and go on to Army of Darkness or to Candyman.
1,NOT Stoker's Dracula,"I give this movie 1 star because it lies to the viewer. This movie is NOT Bram Stoker's Dracula, but a rip-off of the character and then puts the modern spin on the story. If it was named something else or even kept the name Dracula out of it to begin with but called him a different name I'd give it 5 stars.If you want to see the real Dracula story first read the actual book by Bram Stoker, then watch the silent film Nosferatu. Nosferatu is the only Dracula movie that gets the story right. Dracula is a monster, he's not a star crossed lover at all and wasn't intended to be. People wanted there to be some hidden message so they could justify a reason for their otherwise worthless literature degree but there simply isn't one. It's a horror tale, not a vieled porn book, and certainly not a love story. If anything the ones that fail to understand Dracula time and again are his victims who fall prey to his seduction by being anthropomorphic toward him."
2,Alacrud,"Except for the one who says it isn't boring all the one and two star reviewers hit the nail on the head --- but I thought you had to use WOODEN stakes for vampire hearts? Baffling, meandering, jumpy, jerky, and muddled. It's puzzling enough to sustain interest for a time, but long before the end you wish it would. Nothing seems to work. Yet FFC throws everything bar the kitchen sink into this midden. Bats, rats, crosses, circles, blood, smoke, fire, water, lightning, rain, ruins, forests, prisons, loonies, garlic, steak, nudes, skeletons, lesbians. Nothing works. It's not frightening, funny, or stimulating in the slightest. At one point Dracula gets confused with Jesus Christ, would you believe. Strange, but not strange enough to matter."
3,PERHAPS THE WAY DRACULA WAS MEANT TO BE,"I was dissapoited in this film when i first saw it but as I saw it more and more I grew to appreciate it the reason dracula was so old and decrepid looking in the begginig was because he did not have enough blood he was in Trasylvania where feared and beleaved in which is why he moved to LONDON,ENGLAND which was full of unsuspecting nonbeleavers.when he appeared young he still didnt look totally evil but he was hiding his secret personality of evil and ruthlussness deep inside as he stalked and fed on young women in their sleep where the vampire count showed his true colors with his ruthluss powers of darkness such as transforming into giant wolves and bat demons which made him look truely ruthless and evil.Which ever appearence the evil vampire count took he was still the ultimate and most threatining evil of all time that seeks his long lost love and will perform the most ruthless deeds to get her."
5,A Great Flick,"This movie is a great movie with cool special effects, good acting, a solid storyline, and just enough action to keep everyone interested. Gary Oldman does a great job a playing the diabolical, elusive fiend Dracula. The first 10 minutes is really good for setting the scene for the rest of the movie, and the movie is great to watch, with friends, your girlfriend (or boyfriend), or even just by yourself. Winona Ryder, Anthony Hopkins, and yes, even Keanu Reeves give great performances. So if you want to rent a great movie that is both a horror movie and a romance, look no further than Bram Stoker's Dracula."
2,This could have been great,"I'll admit it, I'm a Stoker purist. I think Dracula is the greatest work of vampire fiction in existence. I thought that this was the movie I was waiting for, since so many others had done such a bad job of adapting the book.When I got to the voice-over line ""contrary to popular misconception, the vampire can go about in daylight..."" (or something like that) I pretty much knew that the movie had taken a left turn. The addition of Stoker's name to the title, seems a desperate attempt at legitimizing a complete bastardization of an otherwise classic book.This is Dracula that has been sanitized, prettied up, and produced for all the World of Darkness and Anne Rice groupies who can't stand the thought that vampirism might be a bad thing.I don't know of too many people who fall into a middle ground, I guess that middle ground is for people who have no affiliation to vampire fiction. On that basis, this is quite an enjoyable movie."
4,A Guilty Pleasure,"Sure, Keanu is wooden and Winona's accent doesn't work, but for some reason this remains high on my list of all time favorites. Maybe I'm touched by how seriously Gary Oldman takes his tragic role (a heroically earnest performance), maybe it's the majestically fake-looking sets and costumes, or perhaps I'm simply a sucker for movies where desire and decaptitations merily coexist. It's sexy, gaudy, at times mis-guided, and doesn't possess a single moment of irony. Which is probably what keeps it afloat. END"
3,Review of the Bluray transfer,"This review covers the transfer quality of the bluray disc, not the movie which is one of my favorites and certainly a 5 star film. The problem with the Bluray edition of BSD versus the Superbit release is simple: the transfer to 1080 BD is very uneven. By this I mean the contrast is all over the board; colors are brilliant in one scene and in the next washed out or dull; one moment you are admiring the clarity, the next it's fuzzy and out of focus. The viewing experience is remarkably inconsistant and at times can get a bit annoying to see these very vbisible transfer flaws. I have no problems with the sound of the Bluray release, which sounds very similar to the Superbit DVD DTS AC3 soundtrack.The BD does come with some nice supplemental bonus features. I will keep this release for that reason. But if I plan to ever watch BSD on my Bluray player, it will be with the Superbit DVD, which when upscaled is leagues better in the video department."
4,"""Good Dracula Film!""","Gary Oldman, Winona Ryder, Keanu Reeves and AnthonyHopkins star in Francis Ford Coppola's 1992 horror remakebased on Bram Stoker's book. A vampire travels to Londonand seduces a woman who reminds him of his late beloved.Gary is terrific in this and this 2-disc set has nice pictureand sound plus neat extras. Get this good Dracula film."
4,Bram Stoker's Dracula,"Bram Stoker's Dracula (Collector's Edition)A beautiful and tragic love story. The connection between Mina and Dracula is powerful and soulful. You sympathize with Dracula's deep sorrow for having lost the love of his life. Mina is his reincarnated lost love. The costumes, erotic intimations, imagery, and cinematography are breath-taking. The characters are painted in a sophmoric stroke, save for Gary Oldman's portrayal of Vlad/Dracula. He is stunning in this role."
4,Great Movie - Blu-ray quality is low...,"For those looking to buy this movie for Blu-Ray... The quality is barely above DVD level. I was disappointed with how grainy and blurry the shots were compared to other Blu-Ray titles available.As for the movie itself, it is a classic, and if you have not seen it, you should. It goes over all Dracula lore, from Renfeld to Van Helsing, to Dracula's 3 sisters. And unlike the newer movie Van Helsing, this movie is very good, and oddly focuses on the character and romance, as opposed to relying on special effects."
2,Big-Budget Waste,"Francis Ford Coppola's epic adaptation of Bram Stoker's Dracula is a big waste of time. The movie offers lush settings and an elite cast that seems misplaced, but the never delivers the true horror the novel did. Gary Oldman and Winona Ryder are a mismatch and I hated Keanu Reeves in this film. He has the worst English accent a person can impersonate. Terrifying."
4,A true gothic love story,"While many vampire movies contain your basic good guys and bad guys, in this movie it isn't really that simple to tell them apart. In my opinion, Draula is the hero and he appears to be all to human, with human desires, fears, wants and needs. Don't put off buying this movie as it is a true love story in every sense of the word. But be warned, it is rather gory in certain scenes so children ought not to watch this. Try it, I think that you will be pleasently surprised. Enjoy!!!"
4,Great movie.......,"....but a pity about the lack of special features. Nice ploy, though. Columbia Tristar must have realised that this is a favourite among many a viewer and decided to release this version first. We'll see another 'special edition' in a year or so. Trust me, wait a while."
1,Coppola no more,Can not give a full review as ejected this film after 30 mins.keanu Reeves is cringeworthy in his role and destroyed the film.How can a man create the godfather series abd then make this dung???
1,Boring!,"It was truly painful to sit through this movie. You couldn't get me to watch it again. Bram Stoker's Dracula was one of my first books, so I read it over and over again. It is a classic horror story. I am beginning to believe that it cannot be translated to film. I guess I knew from the very first act that the story was being perverted. Christopher Lee's Dracula evoked more horror than this cheesy version, who at times looked like Liberace,John Lennon and a pathetic werewolf. The lovestory ruined it for me. It dominated the whole movie. I liked Frank Langella's sexy Dracula more. If you're looking for ""vampires who have sex"", The Hunger is a much better movie. It bothers me to think of all the time and money that was wasted on this colossal flop. It evoked no emotion in me at all other than to wish it was over sooner. Read the book."
4,Good Except For Winona's Laughable Attempts at an English Accent! 3 1/2 Stars!,"This was mostly a good movie and most of the actors were very good, especially Gary Oldman who was an outstanding Dracula but I was disappointed with Winona Ryder's performance. She is normally a great actress but she was not convincing as Mina and her attempts at a British accent was horrible and very cringe-worthy. Much worse than Keanu Reeve's attempts at an English accent!"
2,"Great movie, bad DVD...","I really love this movie. It's a very good adaptation of the novel and a priceless piece of entertainment for a Dracula fan. When it first came out, there were a lot of documentaries and interviews on TV to promote the movie. I think that it would have been great to have a couple of these on the DVD edition. A commentary by the director & the cast would have also been great, but the DVD is FEATURELESS... There's nothing (NADA) on it but the movie. I'm still waiting for a better edition to come out. Hope it does..."
5,One of my favorite's of all time...,"GREAT vampire movie! I can watch this over and over again and never get tired. I would have to say if anyone were to ask me what is my favorite movie of all time, it's this one. Dracula, in this film has a love that transcends time to find his beloved Mina. His character was unbelievable, the passion he had, the vengeance, the love - all added to the film. Very moving film, by the end you don't even realize that you wound up on Dracula's side!"
3,Vampire are pretty cool!,As far as a story line goes Dracula hits the spot. There is a lot of good blood and gore but the special effects are kinda cheesy. If you're looking for a good 'B' movie then pick this classic up.
1,Awful,"This movie is nothing like the book. The only thing that is similar to to the book is the character names. The similarities end there. Please do not watch this movie if you have read the book, you will be disappointed."
3,"Nice try, but this is not enough.","Personnally I found 'Bram Stoker's Dracula' to be a bit of a diappointment. For one thing, Bram Stoker wouldn't have known his baby! Instead of the brooding, dark style of the book, Coppola has settled for a lot of special effects and a lovestory, that has nothing to do with the original. It isn't all bad, the cast really tries it's best, especially Goldman and Ryder. The exception is Reeves, who is even more bring and unconvincing then in his action movies. All in all not unenjoyable as long as you don't have any high expactations, but certainly not a classic. Stay with the Lee/Cushing version!"
2,Very bad transformation,"Ok, I have the DVD already and we all know that this film is not a turn of the century masterpiece.At least that's what I thought about this film.I personally think that Gary Oldman's acting was a bit strange. I don't feel scared or heavy- whenever I see him, I see something funny.The reason I like this film is the love story between Dracula and Mina. That's why I am keep upgrading the movie by keep buying new version whenever they are released.Blu-ray. One of the worst bluray that I bought so far. Next to Total Recall perhaps.I don't believe Francis did a lot of color correction or anything before transfering into HD.The color image is really soft and I don't see anything that is close to 'wow, that is really sharp and clean'.No need to buy this Bluray if you already have DVD version.Somewhat I begin to think that even DVD versio is better."
1,How does this compare to the book?,"I did not like this movie. I read the book and loved it. When I saw the movie I saw that it followed non of the books story line. The movie was titled Bram Stoker's Dracula yet the movie portrays the characters and their personalities all wrong. They even add things that are not in the book, such as the love affair between Mina Harker and her ""Prince,"" in the book she depised the Count, in the movie she couldn't get enough of him. So in short it is safe to say that I was extremely disappointed in the movie."
3,"Okay, I admit...it looked cool","Yes, yes, hear me out. While this was a visually stunning film, call me a fuddy-duddy for saying that it wasn't true to the book. It was just twisted around enough for it to not make a lot of sense if you had read the book. Maybe all those illiteracies in Hollywood have caught up to the big wigs, but there were scenes where I had to say, ""I don't remember THAT ever happening"".Yes, the picture quality is marvelous. The sound is great. The special effects were amazing. But if you're going to make a vampire movie and call it Dracula, don't have the monster being a womanizer with romantic intentions.Hopkins is excellent as VanHelsing, the vampire hunter. That alone is worth watching."
4,an enchanting adaptation of a great book,"Francis Ford Copola has created a visual and audio masterpiece with this adaptation of Bram Stoker's Dracula. The romantic element of this story resonates the loudest as the best adition to an already great story. This component allows the viewer to understand Dracula better, and gain a sense of the hopeless languish he is forced to endure, until his heart is reguivenated by the presence of Mina, allowing the perfect delivery of one of the greatest romantic lines in cinematic history, ""I have crossed oceans of time to find you."" No one could have said it better. Great movie!"
4,Good horror movie,"This is one of my favorite Dracula tales. It has a nice gothic feeling. I liked Oldman, he has a charming yet creepy manner that worked really well. I also liked Winona Ryder as Mena, she was very effective. Good acting and atmosphere make for an enjoyable spooky tale well told."
4,WOW! But they shouldn't call this Bram Stocker's Dracula !,"Wow, I have to admit this is one of the best movies I have ever seen, but this movie is nothing like Bram Stocker's Dracula. First of all Dracula was not a loving person in the book at all. He was a mean person who did not love anyone. I'm sure that the reason Coppela made Dracula look like a romantic was because he wanted to attract the female side of the crowd. I completely understand that but I think if he was going to do that he should not have put Bram Stoker in front of the title. But other than that I think the costumes, special effects, and most of the acting was great. By the way I do think that Keana Reeves did a horrible job playing the part of Jonathon. He had the foniest accent I have ever heard."
4,the old fasion dracula,"this movie is great for people who like the old fasion dracula. this movie is filled with art of the past.I have read the other comments and for those other people who say this movie sucks, well, i guess some people just dont see the art in this movie. As I said before, if you appriciate art of the past, you will love this movie. I encourage you to at lest rent it."
5,Best Dracula Movie ever,I think that this was the perfect Love story. I think that every one should see this movie.
5,The most interesting book.,"Brem Stocker's Dracula is the most interestig book that I've ever read. I strongly recomend you to read it, and you'll see that I'm right. END"
5,Something else,"Yes, this film really is something else. I've seen it four times and every time it gives me a thrill. It spellbinds. The actors ( especially Gary Oldman ) make it really work. I am a bit surprised though, that I don't find myself liking the other films made by Francis F. Coppola. I only find them boring. But this is a true masterpiece. Although it's labelled as a horrorfilm I think it's more like a romantic tragedy. If you're into gothic, romantic or anything please watch this one."
3,"Good at times, but too over-the-top","This film could have been really brilliant. The great performances by Gary Oldman and Anthony Hopkins are shadowed at times by the cheesy and over-the-top accents (and I use that term loosely) of Ryder and Reeves. Whoever cast Keanu in this film should be taken out and used for target practice. Talk about a mismatch! The other actors are pretty good, though, but I think that Coppola tried too hard. He could have backed off with some of the effects and let the story run its course. Still, though, I watch this movie over and over for three reasons: the music, Gary Oldman (who is one of the most underrated actors on the planet), and it's a vampire film."
4,Get this edition quick.,I had purchased the new Special Edition of this film and was horrified to find it lacking in quality. This Superbit Edition may not have the extras of the new release but it hands above the the new one. Color and clarity out shine the newer release. The Special Edition is dark and colorless. I saw this film in the theatre and it's didn't look like the Special Edition. I also owned the old Laser release and it too look good. It's really sad that SONY/Columbia re-mastered the film in hi-def (Blu-ray) and it looks so bad. When I tried to get this Superbit Edition at my local store I was told it was taken off the shelves and sent back due to the newer Special Edition. I was lucky enough to find in on Amazon. It was sent out quickly and arrived fast.
4,Bram Stoker's Dracula...,"I did enjoy this movie. Good acting, sets, the whole she-bang! The part that cracks me up the most is where Keanu Reeves' gets bit...oh, see for yourself, you'll see what I mean...Yipes!! Four stars!!"
5,Not just another Dracula movie.,"I never thought I'd be scared by a movie, since I'm generally not scared by anything, but I have to admit this one kept me on the edge of my seat. As touted, the movie goes back to the original book for its inspiration (only it's even sicker) instead of flying off on tangents. The look is gorgeous, and for once artsy camerawork paid off. Gary Oldman, who plays Dracula, is simply terrific; you feel genuine sympathy for him, somehow. The guy who does Van Helsing is really cool as well. It's a great movie, but I wouldn't recommend it to the faint hearted because it's spectacularly gross, and I'm not talking about the fake blood, either. Still, it is way, way better than that Van Helsing movie that came out last year.What makeup jobs!"
4,A Very Good Interpretation,"Although this movie takes quite a few liberties with Bram Stoker's novel, the changes are inventive and flesh out Dracula's character. The addition of a love story between Dracula and Mina Harker (who looks like his lost love) transforms Stoker's theme into a context where evil is even more sympathetic than in his Victorian novel, and the tragic dimensions are clearer. The visual style may be bit off-putting at times, but Coppola's inventiveness more than makes up for it.Finally, I'd like to address the ""faithfulness"" of this movie to the book, since many people see it as heresy. If you want to see a strict visual version of the book, then read the book and use your imagination. It's free and you can use all the special effects you want. If you want to see how someone else interprets the story (someone with actors and money to use), then watch this and enjoy the ride, but leave your pseudo-biblical concordance of Bram Stoker at the door."
2,"A beautifully shot film that much like Dracula, has no soul!","With the talent involved in this one, it should have been great, but with all the attention on the look of the movie, they forgot to give the creature a soul. Gary Oldman is also a very poor Dracula, and along with Keanu Reeves and Winona Ryder give the film no one to care about. Still the film looks good! JUST NO LIFE INSIDE!!!!"
3,Am almost perfect adaptation!,"Coopola's Dracula is a very mixed bag. The novel has its problems and so does the film. On the plus side, it has Gary Oldman's wonderful performance, the costumes and photography are gorgeous, the Count Vlad framing story is really interesting and approproate. However, Dracula as a Christ figure? Winona Ryder and Keanu Reeves are awful and what the hell was Anthony Hopkin's doing. The DVD is absolutely perfect and the second dsic is very involving. Not a bad purchase but, this had potential to be a great film and it isn't. Joe Tucci"
5,You have to see this!!,"This is an awesome movie about the famous vampire Dracula. the good part is that it gives insight on the real legend behind this horror character, and it is not just a boring tale about crimes commited by vampires. it has a very good storyline and it is a remarkable love story between Dracula and Mina Harker. I do not understand why the movie is underrated, because it's probably the best of it's kind and the only movie that describes the legend of Dracula in detail."
1,Terrible transfer,The transfer of this collectors edition is bad. The dark scenes are way to dark. If you are looking for a good transfer stick with the Superbit edition dvd.
1,TOO LONG AND DRAGGED OUT,"I LOVE DRACULA. THIS MOVIE DID NO JUSTICE TO THE LEGEND. WIMONA RYDER WAS GOOD IN THIS ONE, BUT SHE AND GARY OLDMAN COULD NOT SAVE THIS. IT IS MORE OF A ROMANCE MOVIE THAN HORROR. IT SEEMED TO DRAG ON FOREVER. YOU WERE ACTUALLY FIND YOURSELF ROOTING FOR WINONA RYDERS CHARACTER TO STAY WITH DRACULA. I WAS BORED FROM THE BEGINNING AND WATCHED ONLY TO SEE IF IT WOULD GET BETTER. TO MY DISAPPOINTMENT IT DIDN'T. SAVE YOURSELF THE TIME AND AGONY OF NOT WATCHING THIS ONE."
2,Do'nt buy or be ready to disapointed,"Just a short commentary:This movie is boring, wasn't able to scare me and is a waste of time.Some actors like Reeves, Hopkins and Waits did a fine job.But spend your money on something more interesting."
1,WORST DRACULA MOVIE EVER CREATED,"This movie was a huge let down for me, considering all the great actors in the movie. If you have read the novel and expect to see a movie, do not be compelled to see this movie, it is perhaps the worst dracula movie ever created. It is simply nothing compared to the actual novel. So many of the characteristics of the characters in the novel have been altered. I wonder how a great director Francis Cuppola have created such a preposterous version of Dracula when he has created such masterpieces as the Godfather trilogy. This movie is just so pathetic, so much useless nudity from Lucy Westerna. This movie is a disgrace to Bram Stoker."
2,NOT MUCH AT STAKE,"Gary Oldman as Dracula makes as much sense as Bela Lugosi as Lenny Bruce. The redeeming bit of this film fiasco is Anthony Hopkins as a bizarre and interesting Van Helsing. This isn't Bram Stoker, it's Francis Ford Copulating with the script, and patting himself on the back in the process. (The cinematograph scene is useless). You'll see some scene sendups of The Exorcist, Dracula as Phyllis Diller (at least that's what his makeup looked like to me with that stupid hairdo in the castle), and Winny Ryder when she's not busy boosting in a store or something else to get herself busted. Reeves as Jonathan Harker??? You must be kidding. The only thing worse than his Brit accent in this one was his Southern accent in Devil's Advocate. Skip this one fans of the undead--it's staked out."
1,What the [heck]!,"Horrible. This is the worst version of Bram Stoker's classic. Hell, even Mel Brook's movie is more acurate! Mina in love with Dracula? He's a monster, not a womanizer. What was that tiger part? Probaly the worst film of everyone involved. And finally, why does Dracula turn into a Sasquatch?"
1,You Cant Spell Horrible with out the horror,"This is one of the worst movies ever to come out. It seems to like to jump around and do weirds stuff. One Minate Dracula is some old dude, the next he is some young stud picking up the ladies and then boom he's a wolf. No Primse or anything to this movie. I give it 0 stars out of 5."
1,WHAT A LETDOWN!,"When this film was first released I hoped it would be a great version of the story but it turned out to be an overblown mess. The costumes,visuals and performances are all done to excess. My friend and I went to the theatre and laughed out loud at Winona Ryder's acting. Do not believe any reports that this film is faithful to the novel--this is NOT TRUE! Stick with Hammer's HORROR OF DRACULA or Dan Curtis' DRACULA. At least they show some restraint. This is a horror movie for people who don't know what a real horror is!"
1,Disappointed,"Since I've never seen the older Dracula movies, I have no way of comparing this attempted execution. The things that bothered me was the casting of Keanu and Wynona. Keanu felt stiff and contrived, and Wynona came off as her usual overly-dramatic self. Nothing else felt dramatic in action. I felt bad about my giving this to my husbad as a present. I don't think he liked it, either."
3,Its pretty...,"It's not a bad telling of Bram Stoker's story... and there are some fine performances, most especially (in my opinion) that of Tom Waits! Keanu gives a performance as good as any he gives, as well as Winona. I don't consider either of them strong performers... they basically play themselves, but you know what you're getting. Oldman and Hopkins play it over the top (not like Waits however) as they should have, every one else were just sort of... eh?I like it, but honestly only bought it to fill in my collection of vampire movies."
3,"Surreal, erotic, weird, romantic .","This movie is for many, i believe, an aquired taste. The bizzare speedy camera shots and episodic surrealist images may seem too strange, what to speak of Keanu Reeves and Winona Ryder's accents. But even they grow on you after a while. Watching it a few times over, i began to see a clearer vision of what the director and screen writer had in mind. Despite a plot, the movie is held togeather by the intense love between Dracula and Mina (in the movie, his reincarnated wife from 400 yrs. earlier). Gary Oldman and Anthony Hopkins are the cream of the crop here, Hopkins as the excentric, yet practical Dr. Van Helsing, and Oldman, of course, as the perfect forlorned and despairing Dracula.Winona Ryder has a talent for playing sensitive period piece women who have inner strength they may never realize, and Keanu Reeves is underrated no matter what he does."
5,Father Of The Vampires,When i saw this film i was 12 years old.But i cant still forget this.It was so effected to me.I think this film is the best francis ford coppolas film.The casts r wonderful and the places r so fascinating.Gary Oldman and Winona Ryder have been making an unbelievable role.I think dont miss it.
4,Bram Stoker's Dracula,"Visually superb with Gothic overtones. Dracula is a frightening creature, and yet shows a sad and lonely soul looking for eternal peace and rest. Dracula is capable of love and yet fears it's ultimate consequences...A mini masterpiece truly acted and retold. Gary Oldman's performance is breathtaking!"
5,A REAL HORROR THRILLER !!!,"THE BEST DRACULA VERSION SINCE THE ORIGINAL . EVEN HAS A COWBOY IN IT . THE ACTING IS FABULOUS . THE PERIOD COVERS 400 YEARS , THE COLOR IS STUNNING . FRANCIS FORD COPPOLA DID A FINE FILM FOR US ALL . THE COLOR IS AS GOOD AS IT CAN BE. GET IT ON AMAZON AND DIG IT !"
3,Bram Stoker's Dracula,"The movie is more of a chick flick with vampires and wolves? thrown in there,and some homosexual vampire. I rather see a real vampire flick than this romantic-horror,it's not my cup of tea."
5,Achingly Devine,"This is one of my all-time favorite movies! It's a beautiful (although heartbreaking) story. Gary Oldman is an intense, passionate, and exquisite actor. The music climbs into your head and stays there. The camera work is excellent. The movie is so skillfully erotic, it's painful. Anything with vampires is okay in my book!"
1,Bram Stoker's Dracula? I think not,"I can't believe that the makers of this film have the nerve to title it ""Bram Stoker's Dracula."" The film ceaselessly strays from the novel and fabricates such a different story that never in my life would I call it so. The whole theme of Dracula going after Mina Murray because she looks like his fromer wife was never, ever mentioned in the novel; where the idea came from I have no clue. Small, insignificant changes I can take, a change of this magnitude I cannot. Overall, the film IS highly entertaining and has beautiful cinematography, but if you're looking to get out of a book report by watching the it, stick with cliffnotes. The only thing that the film has in common with the book is its ill-chosen title."
3,Not Dark Enough,"Dracula (1992) is just an okay film, because it doesn't deliver in the element of fear and darkness as it should. Instead, we're treated to a world of special effects and somewhat lifeless acting by the 4 stars of the film. I'm not sure they chose wisely when going with Gary Oldman to play the Count; he doesn't resonate or mesh with the other actors, and comes across as lame. Furthermore, there's no sense of doom. However, the romanticism is done pretty well, and certain scenes intensify the movie. Above all, the movie lacks gothic darkness, as that is supposed to be the foundation to a film like this. This film suffers from some poor performances with acting, and a limited range when it comes to environments. It's almost as if the movie takes place in one small setting. Overall, I found this movie to be a tad boring, with some memorable moments sprinkled in. For Dracula lovers, this movie may be for you. Otherwise, this is a movie that's best left alone."
1,Yuck,"I found this adaptation of Bram Stoker's Dracula downright painful to watch. Suffering through Keanu Reeves pitiful attempt at an English accent as the lead character/narrator was horrible. This film is a gaudy, flamboyant attempt at creating an artful masterpiece and falls far short of its mark. This movie is an example of a studio spending a ton of money on special effects and using all the hottest actors, but forgetting to tell a good story. They try to portray Dracula as a sympathetic lover but the result is a pathetic blunder. I'd rather spend the night in Castle Dracula than watch this dog again."
2,"""Technical Assistant in charge of buckets of blood.""","...there should have been about a dozen people with that title.This movie is a horrible rendition of the original Bram Stoker novel. Although it follows the main plot points relatively faithfully, the theme and characters are horribly butchered. I'm not saying that they just changed the characters a bit. No. They butchered them adding random junk for pure shock value (the story did not need drug addicts, lesbians, nymphomaniacs, or hardcore bestiality; sorry). And any time something significan happens the set is hosed down with gallons of fake blood.If you want to really experience Dracula, study some introductory psychology (specifically Freudian) and read the *real* Bram Stoker novel."
3,Good but flawed film,I think the early sequence where Vlad the Impaler strikes the cross with a sword and the cross starts bleeding like crazy happens too fast for my taste.
2,misbegotten in more ways than one,"arguably the nadir of coppolas career, this mishmash can lay claim to keanu reeves's clunkiest performance. a second star cuz the sex scene is fun."
2,Definitely not a classic!,"Grossly overrated, historically inaccurate, and rather tepid film-version of the classic written by Bram Stoker. It has brilliant actors and suitable direction that helps the movie to become watchable, but it has neither the primal horror evoked by the novel, nor the distinction of becoming the best dramatisation of the said novel. That honour rests withCount Dracula (BBC Mini-Series), whcih I strongly recommend to all those actually interested in Bram Stoker's Dracula. If you wish to delve more deeply into the legend of Dracula, then you may find good old Norton Critical edition of the novel helpful. If you wish to go through a thrillride of watching the emergence of the character Dracula through the lens of fictionalised history, I recommend reading Reggie Oliver's ""The Dracula Papers"". These are classics, and would be appreciated without the association of so-called big names."
2,An Oscar? For this?,"Ok the movie is good but...an oscar? Who did they pay off? This movie had potential and some parts of it were good but an Oscar should go to something that would be considered a timeless classic. I had a hard time even finishing it to be honest and I WANTED it to be good.This is a serious case of artistic license taken WAY too far. The main character was well played and well done and there are some really good parts but overall it felt rather spliced together and lacked any sort of ""epic"" feel to it. More like watching one sound bite after another. It felt like it got directed by someone who was trying to make a music video.If your looking for a truly good Vampire saga do yourself a favor and watch Interview with a Vampire. Give this one a skip unless your really bored. Its sad too cause this had some of my favorite actors."
4,Amazing!,"Amazing how this director manages to make so scary a tragic love story like this... He describes very well the dramatic story of Dracula's lost love and at the same time he makes it really frightening! I don't even know if this movie should be included in the, horror section of films or in the love stories.. It is really amazing and unique how this exciting director, in collaboration of course with the writer, manages to make the viewer fall in love with the story and the protagonists... unique and tempting for any viewer. Certainly a must-see for everyone who enjoys the combination of love and horror in a film!!"
3,Not Good Enough To Sink Your Teeth Into,"Francis Coppola's 1992 ""Dracula"" has varying qualities of acting and special effects that leave the audience feeling somewhat empty at the end. The film often seems rushed and cliche without any depth.Gary Oldman and Anthony Hopkins are the anchors to the movie and keep it from falling into a trash-film category. Winona Ryder as Mina Murray plays her role reasonably well as the object of the Count's desires. Tom Waits also steals the show as the Count's deformed servant, Renfield. Keanu Reeves as Jonathan Harker kills the movie in every way: the man simply can't act as anyone but himself.I am a big fan of both Hopkins and Oldman but this movie is simply too mediocre for me to buy. The special effects are extremely takcy with all the trappings of stage props: I've seen better gimmicks at a play. Worth renting once but hardly worth buying."
3,still entertaining,"ugh, as everyone said what da hell does this have to do with Bram Stroker?Anyway, I thought it was pretty entertaining. Gary Oldman was awesome.I just didn't see Winona rider as Mina at all, kinda ruined my experience because of that (not to say that I don't like her in other movies, I just don't imagine her as mina) Mina was supposed to be a strong woman who is extremly supportive of her husband whose life she nurses back from certain death. In the movie not only she is a weakling, she is actually in love with Dracula? The use of Absinthe and the sexuality really took the movie away from the book, although I didn't mind it.I would give the movie 4 stars if it wasn't for the fact that I read the book prior to watching it and felt that the story line was too tainted with."
5,The best looking version of Dracula!,"Ive been browsing through the Blu-ray review websites and most of them gave a poor score for this release of Dracula. So I was skeptical of buying this since all the poor reviews. But I decided to give it a shot and OMG! When I turned this movie on it was just an amazing blu-ray release of Dracula! All the colors are natural and the movie is 14 years old but it looks like a brand new movie just made! This is the BEST release of Dracula, and if you love the movie then you wont be dissappointed with this HD release of Dracula!"
4,"Excellent movie, but at what cost to the actual novel?","While some are keen on pointing out the great departure from Bram Stoker's novel, I seem to take a different point of view. The writer added a key element that makes this telling of Dracula different: the addition of romance. One of the key lines of the film was ""Love Never Dies"" and it works well for this telling. But enough about this.True fans of this movie want to know what's included. For one, the case is beautifully done. And the second disk gives you a lot of behind the scenes looks at how the movie was made. It also includes some interviews with the cast and crew. This is a definate must-have for Dracula fans."
4,Great,"This movie has tried to stay close to the original novel by Bram Stoker and has done a good job. There has often been debate about the sexual connotations in the book and the screenwriters have kept it in, since it is sometimes very sexual.The special affects are great, make-up is fantasticly done and the monsters really scary, I thought the entire movie was scary.Great acting performances come from Anthony Hopkins as Van Helsing and Tom Waits. Keanu Reeves unfortunately speaks a fake English and is not that great.If you like Vampire movies be certain to see this"
3,I used to think this was good,When I first saw this movie i was really impressed by how interesting it was and i really liked it. Then I read the book. Now usually I'm not the type of person to compare book to movie but since they did title this Bram Stoker's Dracula that implies that it should resemble the book a lot more than this did. If you like this movie i suggest that you do read the book. I only marked down two stars for not resembling the book which otherwise implies that to those of you who havent read the book this is a perfect movie.
3,FANCIS FORD COPPOLA RECKED A MOVIE WITH POTENTIAL.....,"Francis Ford Coppola was thinking nothing other than sex, when he made this film. I'm sorry but it only gets three stars, (THE MAIN REASON IT EVEN GETS TWO IS BECAUSE I'M IN LOVE WITH THE BRAM STOKER NAME) Bram Stoker had an excellent story, and Mr. Coppola thought nothing other to stretch it to the limits. I liked the atmosphere though, and the 15th century styled characters that filled this movie about a depressing lust. I suggest the first two versions of BRAM STOKER'S DRACULA. The old old versions. But if your looking for a good BRAM STOKER movie than let me suggest to you BURIAL OF THE RATS, or THE SHADOWBUILDER."
4,DRACULA HAS COME!!!!!!,Ever wonder how Dracula became a vampire??Find out in this film where you journey back to the time of the ruthless romanian knight Vlad Dracula who impaled and tortured his enemies in battle to defend The Catholic Church against the Turks.Find the secret to the evil counts origin in this film.
4,Well Intended But Wafer Thin,"""Shrink to Fit"" is a concise, quick reading handbook on the very important subject of mental therapy. It is fine as far as it goes. but therein lies the problem- it just doesn't go very far. I am certain the authors are 2 high minded individuals, writing with the noblest of intentions.

However as one who admits to having been in (past!) therapy himself, I question the value of turning to this type of breezy publication for serious answers to serious questions.

Beyond that, I would humbly suggest getting information from trusted-and ""neutral""- human beings. It appears I'm the first to review ""SF"". I'll be watching intently to see if other amazon folks agree with my point of view."

5,"Great Brush, worth the money","I thought it was stupid that someone would sell a ""fancy"" curry comb at first (mine was a gift)-- who would spend money on something that will do the same job as a regular curry comb? Oh, how wrong I was. It's worth the money, and I will soon be getting the hard curry of the same line. This brush gets out hair almost as well as a shedding comb, but it's more comfortable for the horse and appropriate for use on more sensitive areas. My horse loves love LOVES this on his face, better than anything else I've used there. He just closes his eyes and lowers his head as he gets more relaxed. Most importantly, it is more comfortable for the horse owner when you've got to do heavy currying over the whole body. It seems to be ergonomic or something. It takes the strain of the wrist, so you can lean into it without hurting yourself."
5,Finally a Brush for my Dalmatian,"I gave this brush a shot for my dalmatian after reading some other reviews on how well it works on short haired dogs and I must say, I've tried most every kind of short haired dog brush out there but nothing worked on her; this brush finally worked. I wish I would have found this sooner."
2,Very strange . . .,"I have visited another bookseller's website and I have been surprised at the number of rave reviews that this totally unimportant book has generated. Here too there are many reviews. It looks like the reviewers are selling the book. Like I said on the other website, the literary style of those reviews reminds me too much the author's. Again, I give this book two stars, one for the paper it is printed on and another one for the glue that keeps it together!"
3,review,Pretty good magazine and covers a lot of topics. Also arrived sooner than originally promised. So that was a nice surprise.
1,Didn't work ... Probably defective,When I first received this unit the box was a little damaged. When I unpacked the unit it looked as if it was used somewhere else. I went ahead and opened it up hoping that it would work but no go. I tried programming the unit to specific channels that didn't work although the unit did power up. I worked with it for 2 days to no avail. I gave up and sent it back. A working unit might be a great purchase but unfortunately this wasn't. I wouldn't recommend based on my experience but others may disagree. We purchased a ZVBox and a scaler which worked flawlessly.
3,Good reference,"This book is a short survey to radar principles, unfortunately, it may not be a good pedagogical materials. First, it assumes the reader to have some background in radar engineering, secondly, some of the equations used are not rigorously presented. However, for a person who is well acquainted with the fundamentals of radar engineering, this book can be a good quick reference in his/her day-to-day work."
5,kitchen sink baby bath tub,I used baby bath tubs designed to fit in the kitchen sink with my 3 kids and was surprised to find them not readily available in stores anymore when my oldest had twins. This tub is similar to the ones I used and better designed. Why lean over a bathtub when you can comfortably bathe babies in the kitchen sink?
3,Don't be confused!,"You are only ordering one tray. The picture shows the full set of six as are being sold by other sellers, but this is for only one. I am returning mine to get the full set.The product itself is fine."
2,Not for serious soldering,"This maybe suited best for arts and crafts projects with all its different attachment tips, but if you want to solder electrical parts, forget it. The soldering tip never gets hot enough for quality work. Better to spend the extra money and get a real soldering iron that works."
1,Disappointed,I wanted to get a btter soldering iron to take care of a few loose ends. I saw this in my search and thought that I could use it for some crafts as well. On my first use a tip broke in the iron. I sent it out for repair and am waiting on a replacement.
4,Very Handy combination...,"With the Hot Knife tools, the dual power selectibility and the excellent base station with holding clamps, this is excellent for use in my R/C Airplane hobby."
4,an excellent product!,"the interchangable tips are perfect for many craft projects!! i have never used it for soldering, but for all the applications that i have tried it works great. the sponge is useful, but if you use it often expect to replace it soon. the stand is very useful and keeps me from burning myself, my table, or anything that i dont want heated. however after 3 months of pretty heavy use it has ceased to heat. i did not purchase this through amazon and have had some trouble getting the company i purchased it from to replace it. but even if they dont i will intend to buy another one. i have found no other craft iron on the market that even compares to the features and usability of this one. i just wish my local hardware store carried it."
5,Black and Decker,"This is without a doubt the absolute best soldering tool I have ever used,and I am really OLD.Thank You for the best product.Thanks Ernie"
2,Not good for soldering,Ditto what the guy above said--it doesn't get hot enough to do good soldering jobs.
2,Great concept; did not hold up for our use,"This looked like a great tool for our purposes: we craft rope trimmed picture frames with 1/4"" nylon rope. This did not hold up well at all - the little knife bent off and we'll be sending this back. This would probably be great for smaller things."
4,good third hand,"I give this 4 stars for the only flaw with this item, one i think that manufactures should already see, the base although over all good, would be even better if a little heavier. The spring could have been a little stiffer. With that said,the base has a hidden drawer in the back that is nice for the extra bits. The flex arms work great ( but remember not a great amount of weight can be held here due to base) The iron fits nice in hand and stays cool the indicator could be better not really a necessary item. I like this iron and if you need a good iron on your bench or need for your craft work I would not hesitate to buy this one the iron is sturdier than others regardless of the base. I feel B&D used good sense in the construction of this item even to putting a wet pad tray to clean tips right there on the base this is vary handy"
1,Masquerading as architecture,"This is nothing more than a glossy brochure for a mediocre builder. The homes showcased are better suited for a spot on MTV's ""Cribs"" than publication under the misnomer of architecture."
5,Delicious,"We were pleased to find Oh Henry candy bars again. The search began because of our grandson, Henry. He was delighted with the taste and the fun of handing the bars out at Halloween. The candy was fresh and arrived promptly. Great product!"
4,"Stacey""s musical heroes...","...stacey's Heroes would have been rather happy with the way she handled their songs and for a very good reason.....this gal can sing and with a voice and style that certainly makes her big league. This is an album you'll love, the great songs and lyrics of past years just prove why they were so good, better I say Great!"
2,Nothing Great...,"Sorry to post a bad review amidst all the other fours & fives, but I just had to.Nothing really about her seems special or unique. Her voice is nice, at best. I expected her to really grab me the first time I heard her, but no, that didn't happen. I've tried repeatedly to get into this cd, but I simply cannot. It's decent music to listen to, but evokes no emotion for me whatsoever.Sorry to be the downer.Looking for a beautiful female voice, check out the late Eva Cassidy. I was simply blown away & moved to tears when I heard ""Over The Rainbow"". She's probably more in the blues or even a bit folk-ish, but the jazz is there indeed. She possessed a true gift."
2,Dreamsville it ani't!,dreamsville it ain't! sorry gang...cant really recommend this CD. not her best work...and i do think she's the best female vocalist out there. i have everything shes done. i really wish it were better.
5,Stellar Stacey!,"An avid fan (and friend) of Stacey & Jim and the rest of their wonderful band...I was awestruck by this newest CD. Listening to it for the first time, was like settling into a favorite chair in front of the fire and melting. Stacey told me a while ago, how excited they were by this work and that they thought it was their best yet. She was right on the mark with that assessment. In describing Stacey's music to a total stranger yesterday, I said that her voice is pure and clean and easy. The band accentuates all of that and more. ""The Boy Next Door"" is highly recommended!"
5,great!,"wonderful cd, got here very quickly and in great shape, would definitely buy from this person again"
5,boy next door - stacey kent,"As an admirer of and collector of Stacey Kent's CD's I did not think she could possibly outdo any of her previous recordings. However - I was wrong - her latest album supasses them all for perfection ofher slightly husky voice and choice of songs. ""Say it isn't so"" is gorgeous as are ""The Trolley song"" and ""Too darned hot"" (sorry Mel and Ella but this version is a strong contendere) and ""Making Whoopee"" which to me supasses many other recordings. I particularly enjoyed ""Ooh.Shoo-be-doo-be"" which I was not familiar with - a cute swinging number. I also considered ""You've got a friend"" -poignently and exquisitely done and a real winner!Well done Stacey - I hope I can get to see you live one day soon in Washington DC."
2,the same,"I think Stacy Kent has real talent, (and her husband sax player Jim Tomlinson has even more) she can put a kittenish sexy twist on songs. Washington Post called her voice ""adult sexuality"". She's a big hit in England.At first she's a revelation. But...There's a problem. She is like a three speed bike, she has three deliveries, slow, moderate and fast. She has a handful of albums out. But the more you listen, the more the songs all sound the same, same inflection, same arrangement, same timing, regardless of which song she is singing.What she need's is to sing with dynamic range and to get some new arrangements, put more of herself, more feeling in the music, instead of making more coy cookie-cutter albums.And maybe give Tomlinson and his Stan-Getz sax tone more space.Her Richard Rodger's album remains her best."
1,"Boring, kewpie doll stuff","I just don't understand how performers like this maintain careers. She's not really a jazz singer, maybe closer to cabaret. Her voice is sugary and kittenish, so I guess if you like that kind of adolescent style...definitely not a woman singing. There's not much real feeling, mostly manufactured. And I don't know why anyone would bother comparing her to anyone else. Diana Krall is not a great singer, but she's got a viewpoint and she can play. Norah Jones is just dullsville all the way around. How sad that the business has come to this settling for really mediocre talent."
5,Absolutely Beautiful!,"There are some books that you meet as strangers in a hallway and part as dear friends forever changed. For me, this was on such book. My dad read this book to me when I was a young girl and I still remember the gripping feeling as I followed Brother Michel on his intense journey. It is definitely worth reading and re-reading. Don't miss it!"
4,Perfect when you have ten minutes at a time.,"The book is comprised of letters famous people would write to their ""earlier"" selves about the lessons they've learned. Of course, not all of the letters are earth shattering but all give insight to the struggles of people across the board. It was easy to digest a letter or two right before bed."
2,Dissapointing,I was looking for a book of wisdom from older women to younger women. This book did not deliver that.
2,not what expected?,"This small tome was not what was expected, with rather superficial musings about topics that deserved a more thoughtful and provocative approach... all in all a disappointment."
3,interesting insights,some authors included in this work give you enough background to understand why they advise their younger selves the way they do. Other authors are just vague. It's nice to compare their experiences and roads to self-development to mine and for that reason it's a good read to keep on the shelf; besides the awesome women included in it.
3,disappointing,"A book full of fluff, nothing of substance...a good book to have on the shelf but nothing else."
3,My first taste of Gospel Music,"I bought this album at a grocery store on vinyl in 1983, it was the first time that I ever heard ""My Tribute"".This album helped to shape my faith and my appreciation for gospel music.Andre' Crouch was and is a talent and a blessing.This collection gives a great cross section of several styles and feelings. Highly recommended."
5,"Absolutely, the best!","If you loved Crouch, you want this keepsake; If you are a teen or young adult, you NEED to hear praise choruses with strong theology set to tunes you won't forget!"
3,Coming Around A Long Time,The Winans established the precedents for most of the contemporay gospel artists today. I believe that all the Praise belongs to God for what He has allowed to be manifested through the Winans.
5,"Five stars for a mathbook, that is","Saxon's explanations are lucid, but sometimes over-laboured; he's perfectly willing to repeat himself over and over. Following each chapter's explanation is a problem set of 30 or so problems, which tests the student on the latest concept and every single other concept covered so far. Needless to say, doing the same kind of problems over and over and over again gets very old. The one redeeming feature is Saxon's word problems, which are inventive and sometimes (as I found against my will) quite funny. Repetitive though the book is, though, it succeeds very well at teaching the student basic algebra; no one can go through this book and not know the material cold."
3,ROCKIN BLUES,"IVE BEEN A FAN FOR OVER THIRTY YEARS WITH PAT TRAVERS BACK IN THE OLD DAYS OF ""LIFE IN LONDON"" AND ""ROCK AND ROLL SUSIE"". OUT OF ALL HIS BLUES CDS I HAVE ENJOYED THIS CD THE MOST. I BROUGHT CD MAINLY BECAUSE OF TWO HENDRIX COVERS ""CROSSTOWN TRAFFIC"" AND ""THEM CHANGES"". IF YOU LIKE GOOD ROCKIN BLUES THIS CD IS ENJOYABLE"
4,For Prog Rock Fans Only,"I loved this album, but then again, I love Wakeman's work. If you are a fan of ostentacious progressive rock - as I am - you should love this album. It may seem a bit over the top to some listeners, but if you really love music, and give it a chance, I really believe the stuff will grow on you."
4,Great second choice to the War of the Worlds - 30th Anniversary,"It's only one disk, one hour.It's everything the War of the Worlds is, but shorter. Still, I wish I had found it sooner, and wish I could find more like it."
3,Better performance on TV LIVE!,"It sounded great, and if i'm not mistaken, broadcasted on 95.5 KLOS FM. So, went to Wallecks Music City in Lakewood, Calif., and bought the album. Not the same, to bad. Video machines back then, don't think they had Bata in 1974, where real expensive. P.S. The guy that was saying something about that Red Cap he was waring, SO WHAT! I'm mean what's your problem about that anyway? This was the time when Alice Copper, Black Sabbath, and I do believe that new Group Kiss was just breaking out at that time. Maybe Rick done that because HE seen what was going on in the future! The bottom line is this! Rick and Ion couldn't stand each other! A lot of FIGHTS AND PROBLEMS, and I know your mad about that, but that's how it goes! COME ON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,A Work Full Of OOHS! And AAHS!,"Ok, fellas, I know it's quite impossible but, I've chosen the 5 best - no, the 10, no the 15, no the 20 (progressive)rock works of all times and this ""Journey"" is among them and will always be. Great!"
4,Blast from the Past,"I've always enjoyed this album, its my progressive rock roots. Tells you a story. Can be a little hokey with some of the Lyrics the choir sings in the ""Battle"", but just sit back and enjoy it for what it is"
3,Tedious and totally over the top,"This is the album fourty year olds can hunt teenage kids with today. I'm 23 and I like this album from an eccentric point of view. It's the most pretentious piece of plastic I've ever heard bar Gentle Giant. I like listening to stuff nobody does today, so this album is really cool.The music itself is ridiculous. Not to be taken seriously.Catch your local punks and lock 'em up with that record playing nonstop. They'll be praying for a bit of ""Close to the edge""!"
2,extremely overrated,This is all pointless nonsense that is saved solely by Wakeman's occasional display of his renowned virtuosity . The vocalist is outright horrendous and the obnoxious narration is anticlimatic . Wakeman is at his best when he is constrained by a solid band like Yes . Wakeman on the loose is too much for me . Forget this one !
1,You've got to be kidding me!,"Don't get me wrong I like some of Wakeman's other solo albums (to some degree). His work in Yes and The Strawbs is still the best stuff he has done though. Well, after listening to this album again, after maybe 20 years, I can only ask myself one question: Is he embarrassed? And people wonder why progressive rock is pretty much universally frowned upon."
1,Journey to nowhere,"Once upon a time, the world famous rock pianist Richard Wakeman wrote a couple of half-tunes. After not having finished them, he handed them to his arranger, a serious musical mind called Lou Littlejohn, and said: 'well, here are the basics. You think you can make a large scale symphonic sort of opera like thing out of this? I need to put out a new album.' Littlejohn nodded. He took the tapes home and worked feverishly for three weeks. Out came most enjoyable orchestral bits and pieces. Wakeman loved them. 'Now', he said, 'all we need to do is add my pub band and a newsreader, and there's my new masterpiece.'Again, Littlejohn nodded and dared not speak, in awe of this keyboard giant, this hero of progressive rock. For a moment he considered asking Wakeman to include his name on the LP sleeve, but after another glance at the masters glittering golden cape, he thought better of it."
1,!Que malo es el tiempo!,"Con 17 años (en 1977) compré este disco y me pareció una obra maestra. Wakeman era el mago de los teclados y de la composición. Podía codearse de tú a tú con cualquier compositor clásico que se preciara. !Qué ingenuo!. Hacía lustros que no escuchaba este disco. El otro día lo adquirí en Cd y corrí a recuperar esas maravillosas melodías. El resultado fué una frustración como hay pocas. Durante todos estos años he escuchado bastante música clásica. La suficiente como para darme cuenta de que Wakeman es tan sólo un mal aprendiz de brujo. Es un correcto teclista, muy vistoso visualmente, pero poco más. Compositivamente, esta obra es absolutamente vacua, pueril y grandilocuente. En el marco de Yes, Wakeman cumple su papel con mucha corrección. Es un buen teclista para la media de lo que son los teclistas en el rock, pero fuera de ellos, sus intentos por convertirse en algo más resultan patéticos."
4,Journey to the Centere of the Earth; Rick Wakeman,"Already have this on vinyl. Went out and bought it shortly after seeing the live broadcast on TV, back in the early 70s. Practically wore out the grooves, hope to get the CD so I can start listening to it again. The only other thing I would like to be able to get ahold of is a video copy of that broadcast."
4,Journey is neat-o,"I have this album on vinyl, and it is an interesting experiece, espesially when, during the narrations, the record skips and new sentances are deleated, let alone whole ones being left out. The melodies and the clavichord(harpsichord?) made me want to die with bliss when i first heard The Battle. i love that 'part' the best. the narrators strong, hearty, nasal voice makes it all much better, and i can just picture the monsters fight, going on for hours, thier heads shooting up like towers. despite that fact that when the choir girls are singing, i can't understand nary a word, it still is a great record with an fantabulous and spledorific clavicord that will make you pass out with ecstacy. the cover art with the superimposed Wakeman are great. he's so greatly nasty, like johnny winters, or is that edgar, or both? anyway, muy bueno."
3,Well....,"Disc works fine; timely delivery; not sure what I was thinking or enjoying back in the day when the music and ""album"" seem Soooo Cooool!"
4,A must have for every librarian,"Forget the stereotype of sensible shoes, here we have a charming story in which the librarian in smart, pretty and wins the day! Should be on the reading list for everyone who loves libraries."
3,Not what I thought it would be,"I got this for my daughter for Christmas thinking how great it would be- the combination of play doh and ponies! However, it's near impossible to make the hair grow as long as it shows on the box and there's a lot of play doh that just gets stuck. The little plastic display stand doesn't really clip to the vanity mirror part either. My 3 yr. old tries to ""cut"" the hair, but it's not long enough for her to cut so she gets aggravated. At least she got 3 cans of play doh with it."
3,There are better playdough sets,"My 3 year old loves playdough and MLP so we bought her this. She uses all her other playdough sets but not this one. She is bored by the fact that all she can is make hair and accessories, the stage is hard to attach to the mirror and keeps falling off. I would get one of the food playdough sets (more pieces = more fun)"
2,"Don't buy this, if you want to save your sanity.","While my daughters enjoy making and decorating hair for the pony, I can assure you that getting the leftover playdoh out of the pony's head is absolute torture. It look me 2 pencils, a butter knife, the scoopy thing that comes with the set and a LOT of patience to clean it out - otherwise, it hardens up there and the next time the child uses it, razor-sharp dried pieces will fall out. This set is not worth the effort."
1,Encourages gender stereotypes and premature sexuality,"From <a href=""http://www.truceteachers.org/"">Teachers Resisting Unhealthy Children's Entertainment</a>: This media-linked set ""presents play dough as only for girls, and turns an open-ended play material into a single-purpose product (to be used solely for extruding the pony's mane).""Toys like this ""dictate that certain toys and interests are only for boys or only for girls, emphasize highly sexualized appearance/behavior that is confusing to children, and make bodies the focus of play and equate self-worth with appearance (often extreme thinness)."""
1,COME ON!,I LOVE THE MY LITTLE PONY LINE BUT I HATE PLAYDOH. I THINK IT'S MESSY AND GROSS AND IT MAKES ME WANT TO THROW UP! IF IT WERE UP TO ME I'D MAKE MORE NEW PONIES INSTEAD OF THIS GROSS SET!!!I WOUNDN'T BUY THIS IF I WERE YOU!I'M 12 BY THE WAY!
4,Just what I was looking for,"I purchased this item as a gift. While the recipient has not used it yet, they were excited to receive itI only wish I could purchase additional trays without purchasing an entire other unit."
4,deviled egg carrier,STACK N SNAP DEVILED EGG CARRIERI LIKED THESE CARRIERS A LOT. THEY SERVED THIER PURPOSE AND AFTER USING THEM ONCE I GAVE THEM TO MY SISTER AS A GIFT. I WOULD RECOMMEND THEM.
3,Delived Egg Carrier,"I ordered this item for my mother-in-law because my son had given me a deviled egg carrier where the 1 dozen carrier trays snap together idividually, but when this item arrived, it was not the same as what I wanted. It will do the job (allow her to carry deviled eggs to a church function) but it has to be 2 dozen not just a single dozen. I was very disappointed that it was not as beneficial as the one my son got me."
5,deviled egg carrier,"This is the best container for carrying deviled eggs to a party! It keeps the eggs from sliding around and is dishwasher safe. I love it! Additional Stack N Snap carriers can be purchased and added on with just a ""snap""."
5,Stack N Snap Deviled Egg Carrier,This item was exactly what I was looking for; the price is excellent for the quality of the product!
5,Love!,"This is a great product! I bought this for a Christmas present for my aunt and just to say a few things, she bought more to connect. Great product and easily reccomended."
1,NOT dishwasher safe!,"I was very pleased with this item when it arrived-- looked like just wanted I wanted, snapped together nicely, could be used for 1 or 2 dozen deviled eggs. I put it in the TOPSHELF of the dishwasher before using it and after going through the cycle all parts were warped so that it is no longer even usable."
2,Brief by Honest Review,Kind of a goofy movie and acting less than average. It's not a movie I would keep as a collectible just a rental.
3,So-so grunge comedy,"None of the relationships in this ring remotely realistic. They are all cartoons, especially the one involving a long-haired Matt Dillon as a grunge rocker and Bridget Fonda as his small-breasted girlfriend. Though you see some of the Seattle musicians who made up the scene in 1992 when this was released, that doesn't compensate for the laugh-free script. It has its charming moments, but this doesn't compare to contemporary romantic comedies. Just ok."
2,mild mannered characters...boring,"I watched this movie for the first time last night, and I wasn't terribly impressed. I normally like Cameron Crowe's films so I expected more.The actors are great, but it's the story I didn't care for.In my opinion, these characters are all so mild mannered....so boring to watch. It seems like everybody in this movie is too concerned about hurting others feelings that I find myself yawning. Not enough emotional extremes. Everybody ends their relationships on the 'lets be friends' kind of thing. Anybody who's ever been jealous or dumped knows that the arena of love is never always that friendly. Far more interesting to watch when it isn't....I think.Heck, I could take situations out of my own life and write them into a far more entertaining screenplay than SINGLES."
3,Eh...,"Moments of truth, but more moments of cliche, bad music and less than interesting characters. All the depth of those cheesy writings you used to find on Starbucks tables. A little better than ""Reality Bites"", but that's not saying much. It'll kill a couple hours."
1,Wrong movie and wouldn't play!!,"They shipped the wrong movie. I ordered ""Singles"", but received ""An inconvenient Truth: A Global Warning"". I put the movie in just to make sure it was labeled wrong and it didn't even work. I only paid $3.00, so I guess you get what you pay for. It's not even worth the trouble of returning it."
2,Waste of time,Really an average film. Maybe less than average. Doesn't worth to spend time and money.
4,Good Movie,I honestly bought this movie because I liked the soundtrack and read that there were live performances by Alice in Chains among other bands. The movie was a pretty good flick; not the best I have ever seen but I am definetly glad I bought it.
3,OMG THIS MOVIE,"OMG, so I was looking for a movie to watch one night with this girl and we were looking for a movie to watch this one night -- me and this girl. So I was like ""OMG have you ever seen Singles starring Pearl Jam and all those Seattle bands??"" And she was like ""look dude, I don't want to see some piece of crap movie. You already took me to an awful zoo today. You gotta step it up or I'm going to run the F right the F out of here. So ... yeah. I haven't actually seen this movie, cause the girl didn't want to see it. But man looks good. Look at that cover. Super captivating. It's like all white. It's in some alternative universe where the sky is completely white instead of sky blue."
5,Singles,"It is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. Although it was made a long time ago, it is still relevant. Campbell Scott and Kyra Sedgwick were excellent in their roles. Their feelings for each other were very touching. Bridget Fonda and Matt Dillon were also good. I'd definitely give it 5 stars. You won't be disappointed."
4,Singles Movie,"Some might say this movie is a little slow, but I love it. If you are at all interested in bands like Pearl Jam, Soundgarden or Alice In Chains - you should see this since many of the band members either perform or have cameos. Good balance of funny and dramatic moments. I enjoy the soundtrack for this movie as well."
1,Horrible Movie,"This movie was the pits. It had no direction, and though it was labeled and set in the 'Comedy' section I would not know it from watching the movie. It was not funny at all. It was so bad, and unbelievable. Do not waste your time watching this movie."
4,good naive love storie,"i'm not in to love stories but this movie makes it happen. It got a nice storie, great soundtrack and good convincing actors.I've seen it many times now and it does not get borring. rent it with your girlfriend and you'll have a plesent evening"
4,I Am Obsessed!,"I cannot lie- this is my favorite movie of all time; the visual equivalent of my favorite comfort food or the security blanket of my childhood.Whenever I get stressed out or feeling miserable, especially on a rainy Sunday, I pop this baby in the VCR and settle in.I know that the Seattle grunge rock scene was way over when this movie was released, but Singles definitely presents a gently softened and filtered version of what a lot of artistic (or hoping to be artistic) and driven 20-somethings of the American persuasion go through. Faux grunge scene aside, Crowe effectively captures the ""process"" of growing up.The acting, of course, is excellent. Everyone nailed their characters perfectly, especially Matt Dillon, Bridget Fonda and Eric Stoltz as ""that obnoxious mime.""One quibble though- The Campbell Scott and Kyra Sedgwick characters both seem much older, physically and emotionally, than the 25 year olds they're supposed to be."
1,Do NOT buy this,I have no idea if the pill itself is good or not but I took it for about 30 days twice a day. The pill is so big I almost choked to death twice. The second time I hacked and heaved for 10 minutes because it went down the wrong hole and finally it came flying back out. I took the rest of the bottle and threw it away. Not worth choking to death on horse pills.
2,If you are prone to GERD stay away,"I used the product and found it helped with joint pain as does the other Glucosamine/Chondroitin/MSM products on the market however I am prone to GERD. I couldnt understand why I was getting GERD flare-ups but eventually I suspected the Osteo-Bi Flex with the Boswellia serrata extract was the cause so upon looking into it I found that a common side effect(s) is:One of the most common side effects of Boswellia serrata extract, when it's used at recommended doses, is mild gastrointestinal upset. Discomfort may include nausea, heartburn, stomach pain, a feeling of fullness or diarrhea.The day after I stopped taking the Osteo-Bi Flex with the 5-Loxin (Boswellia serrata extract) the esophageal burning disappeared completely."
3,Absurdly large pills are difficult to take,"These pills are huge. They are difficult to take. In the future I will go back to the three-times-a-day pills because they go down much more easily. In terms of effectiveness, I've noticed no difference between these and any other Osteo Bi-Flex product. Osteo Bi-Flex is good, but unless you are a horse you do not want these."
3,Great for bad knee - But beware side effects,"I have been using Osteo Bi-Flex now for 2 or 3 months, sadly over a month ago I noticed I started getting a mild headache every day. Lately my headaches have been getting very bad, I also started feeling like I had a mild case of the flu every day, complete with a low-grade fever.I started looking on-line for side effects related to this product, and I was very surprised that a lot of people reported the headaches etc. I have now stopped using this product, and my headaches and flu like symptoms have went away. I was very pleased with what it did for my knee pain, but the severe headaches and flu like symptoms were not worth continued taking it."
2,No difference,Wife saw no improvement in her knees after 3 weeks. Large uncoated pills hard to swallow. Very disappointedWill not purchase again
3,Awful taste,"Arthritis flared up in my knees this winter & this was suggested. I take it every other day (& a generic brand on the other days). Besides the large size of the pills, I hate the aftertaste it leaves in my mouth no matter how fast I swallow it. The generic brand doesn't have the aftertaste, so probably won't continue w/ these once I finish the bottle. My knees are feeling a little better after 2 weeks, but I'm also doing exercises my PT recommended."
3,Big pills,If you can't swallow big pills don't buy this product. The pills are big even for me. There are other products out there with smaller pills but you must take more per day. I'm not sure if they are helping me or not. I need more time to find out. They are definitely cheaper here than at your local pharmacy.
4,Very hard to swallow...there is a better choice,"I love Osteo Bi Flex, but not in this triple strength tablet that is so large I gag on it and can't get it down. The package says easy to swallow, but I choked so badly, my spouse came running. I'm glad I saved the old bottle, because there are so many variations in this product that it is easy to buy the wrong type. I will avoid the Triple Strength from now on, and go with my usualOsteo Bi-Flex MSM Advanced Joint Shield Formula with 5-Loxin, Twin Pack, 120 Ct. eachwhich I have used for the past year, and which helped my bad knee so much. If you compute the cost per pill, this is the least expensive in spite of the high up-front cost for the two bottle package."
4,For My Mum,"She tried it before and really it is effective within 1 weekshe used to feel pain in her leg joints, now she is feeling much more better with it"
5,Love This Product!,"After taking this product for several months, I was once again able to walk down the stairs without pain.Climbing the stairs was never a problem, but going down was simply too painful.Now, I can do both again. Who said that growing old has to become more painful? Not for my knees..............."
4,Big Pill,"I feel better using these pills. I just wish they were a bit smaller. It hurts going down, and two pills, wow!"
4,Reasonably Good,"Yes, the book does seem to be a series of episodes, but I did not find that as objectionable as did some readers. And, while I am sure that there are inaccuracies with regard to geography and leagues sailed and so on, these are not especially noteworthy or destructive of the plot. If there is one objection that might be reasonably raised, it is that of happenstance: whenever the going gets rough, an island appears--or, a long-lost relative just happens to show up in...Jamaica!Stockwin's narratives stress action--the realistic tedium of the voyages (which was handled neatly and realistically in Hornblower and Aubrey/Maturin) seems distatsteful to the author. Nonetheless, I find the series largely appealling and sufficiently different from (say) the Drinkwater group to be worth reading."
2,Seaflower,"Stockwin does an excellent job with the physical details of 19th century sailing and writes tolerably on the sentence level.Two large elements of the novel don't work so well, though. The first is the plot, so-called. Kydd and his friends go through one apparent challenge after another, but all are easily resolved. Just as the drama starts to build, the characters solve the problem or the danger goes away, resulting in repeated anticlimaxes. The plot does not seem to have an overall arc or a structure of building tension... essentially, there's no point.The second problem is with characterization. Though the characters are appealing enough in themselves, they're never challenged and none of their experiences seem to change them. They don't develop through the book.I can't really recommend this."
5,louis malle's masterpiece,"emotionally shattering true-life tale (well, sorta) based on an incident in director louis malles youth wherein the school in which he (played by the very beautiful gaspard vanesse who sadly did not continue acting) was enrolled served as a haven for jewish students hiding out from the nazis. what could have been merely a suspense tale or a coming of age movie (and it IS both, and splendid examples of each) instead resonates as a meditation on survival, betrayal, and accomodating and forgiving oneself. a great film, but only for mature audiences."
3,It's worth a look see,"I thought this movie was very interesting. Although I did watch it in French class and that if you don't understand French watching the subtitles can be rather boring. Plus you don't get the same feel you would get if it were in your native language. Even with that in mind, I rather liked the story because it was true. It wasn't someones perversion of what happened. It was the true story of what happened to an 11 year old boy. You can't even imagine how that would have felt. I think the movie makes you feel an insider perspective of what really happened to French Jews in 1944. Also the title of the movie was a good choice and I like how it was incorperated at the end. Notice that its ""au revoir"" which is goodbye but also means that I will see you again. Just something I noticed."
2,blu-ray quality,The film itself: 5 of 5The quality of the bluray:Sound: 5 of 5Video: almost 5 of 5 except for a section that I ranked 0 of 5.A strong digital noise is present at about the 1hour 51min. This distortion was not present in the previous DVD from Criterion. ATTENTION CRITERION claiming an excellent care in your products. This is not the case here.Amazon changed the bluray disc and the problem was the same. It is a problem of CRITERION.In addition since I live outside the US I lost $ with the credit/debit exchange rate conversion.I did not do a return and kept the bluray. The rest of the video is much better than the DVD except in the few seconds mentioned before. I was expecting good quality for the price paid.
4,Honest life-like drama sans sentimentality,"We who are Americans have little realization what childhood in an occupied country would be like. This movie shows pre-teens being themselves against the stark reality of the world war II era in France.It is at once a coming of age movie and a social conscience movie, succeeding on both levels. There is a gentle humor in scenes. The drama is underplayed. The story speaks for itself and has a flow throughout. There are no great surprises, no great dramatic heights here. But there is a real story here of childhood bonding.This is a French film with subtitles, but don't let the subtitles keep you from enjoying this film."
4,maggie still rules....,"If you have liked Maggie from her wonderful days with Mike Oldfield, then I recommend you buy this. Many of the songs are mellow, but they slide thru your ears like your favorite memories. Outstanding cuts include her first single, ""Adelena,"" and one of my all-time fave Maggie tunes, ""Talking to Myself."" Just for that song alone it was worth the import price. Sadly Maggie has never had much of a US following from what I can tell, outside of those faithful who like the 80s pop CDs by Mike Oldfield. So I hope she can capture a larger audience with this release. If you don't buy this one, start off with her fabulous ""best of"" collection, THERE AND BACK AGAIN, which includes some great songs from her Oldfield career plus some knock-out beauties from her other solo CDs."
2,lots of lofty language,This book started out alright but it quickly went over my head and I'm not a dummy. I didn't finish it and can't in all honesty say it did me any good.
3,Wait for the updated version (Feb '98),"A good start, but way, way behind the times.Many questions in sample tests aren't covered in the book.Several of the questions submitted by the authors are very ambiguous, and in one case, probably wrong. Some of their questions were presented in the wrong practice exam, thus hadn't been covered yet. The questions from other sources were much better."
1,EXTREMELY NASTY!,as has been repeated before this book is a sales pitch with only 1/10 of it being technical info. the info is very vague and poorly organized. review questions are vague and many answers are WRONG. the authors just wanted to make some money but NOT to educate anyone.
2,"No, there is another . . .","The book is all right as a general overview, but it does not contain much detailed information about what's on the test. I liked David Groth's books (A+ Core Exam Study Guide and A+ Windows/DOS Study guide). They cost a bit more (about $40.00 apiece through amazon), but they contain much better information."
2,"Too vague, but worth a look to learn about A+","The first few chapters of this book contain good information about being A+ Certified. Unfortunately it gives many charts and graphs which I could live without. The chapters which I purchased the book for, the technical chapters, were seriously lacking. I found quite a bit of the information outdated. Even though I am an experienced technician I found much of the information so vague as to be confusing from a beginner's perspective and often misleading. This book is a good reference about the exam and certification, but I wouldn't rely solely on it for taking the test. Definetly wait for the next edition."
2,The book doesn't deliver,"The book was written more as a summary than anything else. If you don't know your stuff,this book won't help. If you do, you don't need it.Until a better one comes out,I wouldn't buy it.(P.S. It took me two times to pass the exam.)"
2,"Publisher could do much better, no cd, book upside down",Although the book was well written there were no other aids like a cdrom. Pages themselves were upside down from outer cover and some pages were not properly positioned when printed. There are several other books much better than this one. I would not buy. (hard cover binding reviewed)
4,It's an ok book for a general overview,Several questions in the sample tests was not covered in the text. This book is a good general overview of the test. Sad part is the first 2 chapters is pretty much sales pitch for you to take the test. Good info on ideas on troubleshooting and client-services skills
1,This book should have been a magazine article,"This book contains about the depth of material you might expect to find in a magazine article about A+ certification. What success it has had was strictly due to the fact that there was so little available on the topic. Thankfully, that situation has now changed. The David Groth titles ""Core Module"" and ""Windows/DOS"" from Sybex are so completely superior to this thin overview as to not even be comparable. The sad part about all this is that now that there are finally outstanding books on the topic, CompTIA is about to change the tests (due out in July or so). Though to be honest, the tests (especially the Windows/DOS test) are greatly in need of updating."
2,"I read the book (3 times), took the test, and failed.","Book is not up-to-date. Questions and answers don't seem to make sense. Wait for a better one. And believe me, the A+ TEST is very difficult."
1,"Too bad a rating of ""zero"" is not available ...","I've never felt so cheated after buying a book. It was poorly written and poorly edited. Also, the authors place too many ""war stories"" in the text and not enough of the technical details needed for the A+. Luckily, I passed the test recently (no thanks to this book)."
2,"Good intro to the A+ program, but not a good study guide","I have purchased this book to find out what the A+ certification is all about, which it did explained BUT this is by no means a study guide. I recommend the A+ Exam Cram or Mike Meyers A+ All in One Certification or any other A+ certification books."
1,Disorder and Early Sorrow.,"A fitting description for this book, even though it is also the name of one of Thomas Mann's novellas. This book should not have even been published, because it is confusing, misleading and contains some outright errors. A scandalous waste of time. Don't even read it from the library. Use other guides. Even ""A+ For Dummies"" is better than this waste of trees."
1,"Thanks Guys, I almost threw in the towel",After reading this book I told myself 'forget about A+ Certification'but after reading the reviews I feel so much better.This book was very confusing for someone with less than 1 years experience in the computer industry.I agree with another reader who said this should be a news/magz acticle.Anyone have any good recommandation for a good test prep for A+ ?
5,nice,"this is a concise and fairly comprehensive book on finite groups.it is very, very nice. in about 200 pages, it gives you all of the basics. a bright high school student can read it.books like these are so much better than annoying books like Artin, or Lang which are like 700 pages and are basically a brain dump of the author onto the student.if you want to learn group theory by yourself and have a patience, read this book, then the book by James and Liebeck. then to learn Lie algebras/groups, use a book like Erdmann or Kirillov or this very short new book by Yvette Kosmann-Schwarzbach. for lots of examples look at Fulton & Harris."
2,Not nearly as good as the first,"Bought it for the kids for Christmas, not anywhere near as good, not as funny, not as entertaining, as the first. The characters don't ring true, and the antics are just too out there. The kids watched it once and haven't picked it up since."
3,"Its a sweet movie, but just not as good as the first...","Unlike the first film, the one in my opinion is more strongly targeted to children only. The amount of ""magic"" and such just more strongly exaggerated in this one. All though very cute, I personally would have enjoyed the movie more without the piglet swimming part, and the flying motorcycle, but perhaps that is just me. I would definitely say it is a nice way to spend a few hours on a rainy afternoon with kids, but not a movie I would suggest to adults to watch solo."
5,i love this movie,"This is a great family movie with small children. Teaches many (at least 5) lessons. Wish I had the stick Nanny has, I could use it at work."
5,Nanny McPhee Returns,"Great movie for the whole family. I liked this one even more than the first. My kids, who are 4 1/2 and 6 years old, are even bigger fans of Nanny McPhee now that they have seen this movie. Emma Thompson is wonderful as usual. I would definitely recommend this movie. A must have for your movie collection."
1,Nanny McPhee Need Not Have Returned,"We thoroughly enjoyed Nanny McPhee and were thrilled to watch Nanny McPhee Returns.The first few minutes were hopeful, the set was very colorful and the plot was just beginning to be laid out.Five to ten minutes into the movie and we all knew we were watching a bomb of a movie. The characters were dull and wooden, the plot insipid and contrived.A woman's husband is off to war and she is left to try to keep the farm and pay the bills. Her brother-in-law (really stupid character) is determined to get her to sign away the farm. It all depends upon selling or not selling six piglets (really!!).The young children watching began to trickle out of the room to go play with their Legos, followed by various adults leaving to get a good long drink in the kitchen and maybe a bite to eat, anything to not have to return to the Nanny McPhee Returns movie.Everything about this movie was poorly done. It is slap stick at its absolute worst.Nanny McPhee should not have returned."
1,Nanny McPhee Returns,When you show this dvd you don't mention that it is in wide screen. but when you mention Nanny McPhee you do mention that it is in full screen That is why I gave it a low rating otherwise it wqs a good movie
1,nanny mcphee returns was a real bomb!,i loved nanny mcphee 1 but no. 2 was a big disappointment! sometimes a movie should not have a no. 2 this is an example of that --- it was like trying to paint a mona lisa 2---- nanny mcphee was a master piece---- the 2nd one nanny mcphee returns was a vast waste of time!--- this saddens me that they were going for the money & not quality! boy! how sad!
3,Nanny,This film was enjoyable but I was a little disappointed. It was not as good as the first film perhaps they tried to stay close to the first film's story line. You knew what was going to happen before it actually did. I think Emma Thompson is GREAT and will make an effort to see all her films.
4,Nanny returns,My granddaugher and I really liked the first Nanny McPhee movie. We have watched it several times. Nanny McPhee returns is good but doesn't compare to the first one but We enjoyed it
4,cute movie,"usually the sequel to movies are not as good as the original but not in this case, it may even be better"
5,Nanny McPhee Returns,This was as good as the first Nanny McPhee. We would like to see more movies made just as good as both the McPhee movies were.
3,nice,Nanny McPhee Returns [Blu-ray]Nice but the fires one was much better can have nice time just with number one
3,Nanny McPhee Returns,I have enjoyed this dvd already the only thing I didn't like was it has rental printed on it. I had no idea it was a rental. I think you should be told up front.
3,Good Family Movie,"...not as good as the 1st, but my kids like it. I may be being to critcal. Emma Thompson is always good."
4,Not as good as the first one.,"I enjoyed the movie, but felt this one seemed very disconnected from the original Nanny McPhee. This one seemed more farfetched."
3,less brilliant than first,"The first version was a total surprise with all new surprises, but this, while having a good assortment of characters and good acting, was not as surprising."
5,A real delight,I volunteer at a Christian Radio Station and all the winter volunteers loved this film. So a great film for all ages.
5,Fun for the entire family,Went to see this movie with one of my grandsons which prompted immediate purchase of it's prequel. We all enjoy watching them back to back for sleepovers.
4,Nanny McPhee,It was a very nice movie to sit down and just enjoy and I will watch it again. Outstanding cast.
4,Great show,"This is a great family show. I like Nanny McPhee (the first one) better, but this is still a wonderful and fun show."
3,"Sweet, but not as good as the first","This sequel suffers from what seems to be a typical syndrome; it is not as good as the original movie. It has its sweet elements: the scenery is beautiful, there is a happy ending, Emma Thompson is her lovely self at the end and Maggie Smith is a delight, as always. But....the plot is predictable and the fantastical magical elements are contrived. I did like Nanny McPhee's crow familiar who had a lot of charming personality. The movie did make me smile and brought moments of misty-eyed sentiment, but I don't need to own this or see it again."
4,Nanny McPhee Returns DVD,This was a great video for the kids. Got it as a Christmas present and both granddaughters sat intensely watching and laughing.
2,Tired replay of first movie,"Two stars for decent production values and a few good lines. The story was a rehash of the first Nanny McPhee plot, told against the backdrop of WWII. What was charming in the first movie, upon replay, became flat and disappointing. Not even Maggie Smith could overcome a poorly-written, poorly-directed script. She became just another cartoon character. Over-reliance on stock characters (e.g. the deceitful brother-in-law) made it a cartoon instead of a movie. Magic, plus slow pacing, made this movie a tired attempt to earn money off the McPhee franchise. The ending relied too much on special effects to draw it out like some sort of fireworks-like grand finale, but it became boring halfway through."
2,Not nearly as good as the first,"My family enjoyed the first Nanny McPhee movie. I found the 2nd one to be disappointing. There are some major plot flaws in it. For example, in the beginning, the 3 children are behaving and doing their chores. They do argue with the cousins once they arrive, but they are not terrible like the children in the first movie. They are not in desperate need of Nanny McPhee. The mother is at work when the cousins arrive, so she can't possibly know anything is wrong at all, but this is when she figures out she needs Nanny McPhee. It didn't make sense.After that, the movie was ok. I did like the ending, and how they connected it to the first movie.Also, I would not consider the Blu-Ray version to truly be ""blu-ray quality"". It was, perhaps, a slight upgrade over the DVD version, but not by much."
1,a snorer!,don't bother with this book unless you have trouble sleeping.no romance no plot no character development. no good!!
1,This book points out the need for the Zero star rating,"I have never read Ms. Coffman's books before and thought I would give this a shot - I wish someone had shot me instead! I read the first 50 or so pages, skipped a few hundred, read another page, and then gave up. The dialogue was terrible, the plot uninteresting, and the characters could not have been more boring and bland. I am a voracious romance reader and this book is one of the worst examples of the genre I have read in a very long time."
2,Big Disappointment,"I've enjoyed several books by Ms. Coffman was looking forward to a new story by her. I was VERY disappointed with the flat characters and the flat story telling of this book. Maresa is a very hard character to like because of her exceedingly negative and childish personality. Percy is passive and wimpy and you just want to give him a big kick on his butt for letting Maresa run all over him!! And I was overly disappointed with Ms. Coffman's writing! It was almost as if somebody else wrote it and put her name on the cover, because the story did not flow, nor were any of the descriptions and feeling like her other books. Maybe because the publisher is Mira, and it doesn't have the high standards as Avon or Batam, but this was by far the worst book written by her."
2,Fiddle-de-dee,"This is the first and last book I will read by Ms. Coffman. What can I say, the writing was choppy (there was no flow whatsoever), the characters were underdeveloped and I kept waiting for Maresa to exlaim ""Fiddle-de-dee"" (Note: in no way, shape or form did this book compare with Gone with the Wind, though!) And not to spoil the ending for those who want to read the book regardless of this review, IT IS VERY ANTI-CLIMATIC and not worth wading through the endless pages of the book to find out, of course, that the hero and heroine end up together."
1,Disappointing Effort from a Good Author,"I've read this author's books throughout the years, and have truly enjoyed her writing. This book comes as a big disappointment. The characters are unlikable, shallow, and uninteresting. The romance between the two title characters remains a mystery, as the heronine is (from start to finish) self-centered, vain, and unlikable. Also, the unresolved conflict between Maresa and her father was frustrating -- as I felt that this was the only really engaging relationship in the book."
1,The Fifth Daughter,Disjointed....Both characters are kind of pathetic. Maresa is so non-introspective (even though the author admits this and uses it to define the character) that you wonder if she ever thinks about anything. And Percy is a wimp. He never gets over or grows out of a crush he had on a self-absorbed child. I was very disappointed with this book. I have really enjoyed books by this author in the past.
2,Cowboy Magic Shampoo,I would not purchase this shampoo again...........Leaves a bad smell in the dog's hair.It truly should be used on horses.....
3,A bit Harsh on my skin,The mask was good :-pros :- its decent for people wth dry skin.cons :-if you've sensitive skin it will cause redness.
3,Hype?,"I want to know what all the hype is about...it certainly is not a bad cleanser at all. In fact, it is pretty awesome! Usually (with panoxyl(sp?)at least) benzoyl peroxide - the main acne fighter in this product - dries me out and irritated my skin. So, its gentle on the BP sensitive. Also, (I don't like it but) it does have menthol which gives the ""wake up"" cooling sensation. I suppose I'm not being fair as I haven't tried it as a mask yet, but the product doesn't seem to be that great on my acne (which is mainly stubborn blackheads and some whiteheads). It does an okay job of preventing new formations, but its not touching what I already have. That is why I went to try the Oil Free Grapefruit cleanser. BAD IDEA. Compared to THAT hot mess, this is a gem!"
4,34 inch for big guys on the team,lots of pop have 4 guys on the portland river hawks a team in the northwest indpendant baseball that are 200 plus that swing this lots of pop the D243 has a bigger barrel and the smaller guys on the team prefer it
1,Don't buy this book!,"While this is one of the best and most enlightened books on the topic that I've ever read, this Kindle edition is full of mistakes. Nearly every page has incorrect punctuation, strange spacing, misspelt words or some such rubbish. Rather get one of the free version available all over the net.I unfortunately waited too long to start reading the book, so my return window has expired and I'm stuck with this piece of junk."
3,Rich!,"This book is a riot. Ingersoll's prose is heart-wrenchingly earnest. No one has ever picked a fight with his grandmother with more zest and determination than the Colonel. One is tempted to read this book with one's hand over one's heart and a perpetual tear ready to drip form one's eye, as Ingersoll (The Magnificent!) courageously dismantles a 14th century literalist's interpretation of Christian scripture, lower lip a' quiver.If you are a male virgin, between the ages of 18 and 25 and have parents who go to stupid dumb church every Sunday (and expect you to go too, those ignorant stupids!), then here's your deliverance. Accidentally leave it on the coffee table for them to discover! What a hoot!If you're anyone else then this book will be a pleasure to read simply for its grandiose, sweeping, self-conscious prose. Many quotable zingers."
1,I wish he just would have looked at the evidence,Ingersoll missed all the evidence that has been found that proves that the Bible is true. He was not looking at this situation with an unbias mind like he tells his readers to do.
4,Good for Portable CD play Not bad radio,"This is perfect for good enough quality in a and portability, for those who don't want an I Pod. I use it in the gym. Works fine. Also receives radio signals better than I thought it would."
3,Not sorry I watched it but. . .,"Not enough of Edward G. Robinson, who can do more with the bags under his eyes than most actors can do with their whole faces. Too much of Ginger Rogers in a horrible hair-cut and a horribly strained effort to play the ""bad good girl."" In fact, that's too mild; she's just horrible in this. Brian Keith does a very creditable job. There are some well played small parts - the policewoman, the sister, Lorne Greene as the gangster, who is a revelation for those of us who have never seen him in anything other than Bonanza. The script can't quite decide whether it's a suspense or a comedy and fails at both, but it has enough bright moments of each to make it worth watching."
4,Great Stroller,"This is a great stroller if you have taller children. My daughter is 4 and she's quite the stringbean. Other strollers often are too short and her feet hang over. This one is perfect for her. There are no issues with my other child who is 1. There's tons of space, pockets, storage room. The only thing I don't like is trying to turn the stroller. The front wheel does not swivel, making it difficult to turn. It would be great on a path that's perfectly straight. I find myself picking up the back of the stroller to get it around a corner. Kinda hard to do and very inconvienant if you ask me. Other than that, I really like this stroller. There is a swivel wheel conversion kit you can purchase for an extra $65."
1,This was absolute crap !,"My wife and I rented this from Hollywood Video for the listed cast which looked excellent and the description on the back cover as ""Romantic Drama"". This was not romantic at all. It was filled with excessive vulgar language, and voicing explicit sexual acts. The acting was poor as the casts discomfort with the script showed it as forkful dialogue. The story line was confusing, choppy, and pointless. In end, the movie leaves you with nothing to say.It appears that the director was smoking crack when this was made. Don't bother seeing it unless you want to go through the pain. When I returned the movie to Hollywood Video, I made sure that I spoke to the manager to tell him ""This was absolute crap!"""
1,Just plain bad,"I was not in any way entertained by this movie. I love all types of films, but this one I could not get into. I agree with the others who reviewed and said that it was basically all about 'I LOVE YOU' 'I DON'T LOVE YOU ANYMORE' 'I HATE YOU''I WANT YOU BACK' 'ON SECOND THOUGHT, I DON'T LOVE YOU'JUST PLAIN BAD!!!!"
4,Initial take on buying service,I think this was a wonderful purchase. I have not watched this DVD as yet but the price and shipping were great.
5,Lies and the truth,"This is a fantastic movie about lies, truth, and obsession. One character works as a stripper(Portman) and dates an obituary writer(Law). The obituary writer is having a secret liaison with a photographer(Roberts) who is married to a dermatologist. All the characters are strong. The dialog is harsh and moving. It`s a rare movie where all the characters have depth and you find yourself sympathizing with each of them. See this movie."
1,Godawful,"The only good thing I can say about this movie is that it's reassuring to think that no events similar to the events in this movie have ever happened. Not that no one has ever cheated, lied and generally behaved like a scumball, but that no one has done so for such incomprehensible and arbitrary reasons or with such utterly unconvincing dialog. In fact, ""Aqua Teen Hunger Force"" had rather more realistic dialog than this movie. In scene after scene, we're supposed to believe that there is sexual tension between these characters, even though they actually just seem to despise each other and feel very awkward around each other. ""Time"" magazine apparently called this ""a love story for adults."" All I can say about that is that if adults actually behaved like this, then civilization would collapse in less than a year."
2,Amazing actors wasted on bad script,"Here's what the DVD box said about this film: ""A witty, romantic, and very dangerous love story..."" In fact, this film is neither witty nor romantic, and it certainly isn't a ""love story."" This is a film about sexually unhealthy people who bombard us relentlessly throughout the movie with their weaknesses, insecurities, and lack of capacity for love and understanding. If any single person in this script had learned anything at all from their experiences it would have helped, but we are left with an over-riding sense that the whole mess is just one big empty vaccuum of unfilled relationships, inability to make amends, lies, deceit, guilt, perverted sex, and failed attempts at love. Sorry, but although I love all four of the actors in this film, it's pretty much the worst script I've seen in years."
5,A very worthwhile movie...,"I was hooked on this movie from the first scene. All the actor's played their characters to perfection. Although Clive Owen's character was greatly flawed (as were all the characters), I was immediately drawn to him. He made this movie for me. It's a sad movie full of emotion and heart break, but it's great, and I loved every moment of it."
4,Critics are from Fantasy Land,"Most negative reviews of this movie fit the following two categories:1. The language was vulgar2. The people are not likeableSome movies depict Fantasy Land, where people are good, the endings are happy, and dancing munchkins pass out lolipops. If you are looking for such a film, the Wizard of Oz is always an option.Guess what? In the real world people swear. People manipulate each other. And the cowboy does not ride off into the sunset. He gets shot in the back by the woman he burned."
1,BOOTLEG,Thought I bought an original DVD but it ended up having Chinese subtitles and the words FOR YOUR CONSIDERATIONkept appearing while watching it. Don't recommend this buyer.
5,Thank you.,"Loved this movie. I loved it cynisism and down right nasty look at love and relationships. Perhaps this is because I am a bitter [nasty] but everything in it rang true to me. It is the story of 4 people who meet become involved and then tear it all up and cheat and then go thru all the mechinations of covering up, breaking up, being supposedly happy till they find something or someone else and then go thru the whole cycle again. I am not a big Julia Roberts fan but she was good in this. Clive Owen was just excellent as the brutish but likable macho guy. The internet chat/cyber sex scene was hilarious as was the Roberts/Owen break up that just was biting and hardcore down in the dirt dialogue. The whole movie is full of great hardass dialogue that I just thought was hilarious.Also, Natalie Portman as a stripper and in a thong."
3,No one to like,"Not since Little Black Book has there been a movie where I dont like any character. Closer is a strong movie, will harsh, sexual words, and great performances from everyone. There is a little bit of confusion, but it's hard to completly like a movie when there's no characters you can relate to."
2,Storyline doesn't work well.,There's already been enough reviews so I'll keep it short. This movie just tries to use sexual inuendo and images to makeup for the poor storyline. It is not deserving of any awards. Julia Roberts is blah in this. Natalie Portman is good and Jude Law is good but the movie itself is disappointing and just goes round and round and ends up rehashing itself. The biggest problem I had was it showed peoples emotions changing with the wind without any real reason.
2,It Needed Something....,"Like a plot...Like some believable characters...Like an ending.This wasn't really a movie as much as a bunch of clips strung together without any real, clear meaning. I could say it was foolish, sophomoric, vapid, and devoid of meaning, and all that would be true. But to be truly accurate about it, I guess I would have to ask Mike Nichols why he thought enough of this to direct it.Some of the scenery was striking and with what they gave him to work with, Clive Owen was very good, hence the two stars. If you don't see this you won't have missed a thing."
3,A little disappointed.,This is a movie about obsessed ploeasure seekers which a found to be tedious and boring. Clive Owens gave a great pewrformance on a character I completly disliked. No one was likeable and I thought Julia Roberts was miscast.
1,AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL,"Oh dear - what has the previously wonderful Julia Roberts got herself into here? Actually, she, together with the trio of ohter main characters, holds her character role well in this sad, depressing tale of unfaithfuless, sex, [...]It could have been so much richer fare, this movie. The underlying theme of two couples who really are more interested in their opposite numbers, is not original but nevertheless this cast could have done great things with it; attractive, and good actors all of them without a doubt. But the script is unnecessarily filthy, including a long email conversation about masturbation and oral sex, explicit references to all kinds of sexual practice hopelessly out of place in a '15' rated film (UK). Add to that the scenes in the sex club....you get the idea, be warned. What a shame.So actually my friends and I walked out at that point, so to be fair to this review, we didn't see the climax ( pardon the pun)."
1,Horrible,Clive Owen is disgusting in this movie. They're all disgusting but especially Clive Owen. All that foul language made me cover my ears and beg him to stop. I should have turned the movie off instead of wasting my life on this trash. I rented it because of Julia Roberts. I expected better from her.
2,If you are having suicidal tendencies this will put you over,"If you watch movies for the quality of the acting than this is a good one cause all the actors play atypical roles and do a great job. But if you watch movies to be taken away from the reality of life and feel good, this is NOT the movie for you.The characters screw each other over and you have trouble buying that any of them with the possible exception of the Natalie Portman character really care about the people they are supposedly in love with. What's more you will have a hard time really caring about any of them. The Julia Roberts - Clive Owens story is one of the single most depressing couplings I've ever seen on film. This is not a feel good movie by any stretch of the imagination. The only way it might make you feel good is if you think you're own relationship is dysfunctional, it might seem better by comparision. But if that's not the kind of feel good you are looking for don't waste your time or your money."
1,"No message, no plot, no sex, NO POINT","This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I just didn't get it. Julia, Honey, this was way beneath you."
1,What a waste of time!,"I wouldn't even give it a star. This is unromantic, is gross. What a dissapointment. I thought this was a love story but it wasn't at all, this was only about sex & lies. The only good thing was the acting, that's all."
5,Best Picture?,"This movie is probobly the best I've seen this year. It has it all; love, intrigues, sex, and relly facny dialogue. I vote for Clive Owen when it comes to the best supporting actor. Go see it!"
1,Annoying in the Extreme!!!,"Unlike other reviewers who have obviously responded well to this film, I found it extremely annoying. The characters were so childish, self-centered, pretentious, shallow and selfish that I absolutely despised them all. I don't mind films that inflame my passions in a negative way - I've even liked a few (e.g., Larry Clark's ""Kids""). But, this excessively talky and frustrating drivel was far too absurd to be taken seriously. I just didn't buy the motivations of the characters and frankly couldn't understand why I should give a whiff about any of them. Near the end of the film, I found myself thinking that if the characters were real people, as opposed to fictional cardboard cutouts, I would be more than willing to push each and every one of them off a very high cliff, not so much to end their misery as to end my own!!! I HATED this film!!!"
2,Wannabe grown up film,"The characters in this film keep deceiving each other, showing frailty and coldness at the same time. So many films fall into this trap. Apparently, being a real adult means lying, masking your boring existence with sexual adventures, being ironic instead of having a sense of humor, and being completely self-obsessed.Some people might welcome this film after an overdose of Hollywood sugary romantic flicks, but there is a whole wide world out there of films with interesting things to say. This one is as shallow as it is pretentious."
4,Interesting,"As a previous reviewer said, ""Closer is basically the ickiest, grossest, most dysfunctional parts of all your past relationships strung together into one movie."" Dysfunctional is the key word here, no one trusts each other, and temptations abound. What a mess! Clive Owens and Jude Law are good at playing manipulative jerks and showing us how they attempt to lie themselves out of various sticky situations. The women in the film, appear to be more of the innocent victims, caught in this web of determinism. For a look at Julia Roberts in a little bit different of a role, a more serious role, this may be worth it. I'm afraid guys will be gawking at Ms. Portman not for her brilliance, but her body in this one."
1,Don't believe these reviews...,"Closer was absolutely one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I know what they were trying to portray, human intimacy, and they absolutely failed.Its pretty much, how much gratuitous sex and foul language can we throw into one movie with 4 terrific actors, and call it an achievement. Boring as hell and very graphic, Don't waste your money."
1,Crap,"This movie is simply crap. It is overacted (how many scenes can you have of staring off in thought), underwritten (has anyone ever known people to act like the characters), puts people in completely inconceivable situations (Clive Owen's sex-obsessed character somehow seduces Julia Robert's character with smut talk???). This movie was very stupid, and I am just as stupid for having paid to see it once. Don't let the names on the marquee fool you, this is crap."
2,Misery Loves Company,"I would like to be farther away from this movie rather then closer. This movie stunk so bad I had to open the windows. Great cast gone wrong. I love Jude Law, Natalie Portman, and Julia Roberts but they should have read the script before agreeing to do this movie this could have ended some of their careers. Based on a love triangle 2 couples seem to find love with the other couples other. Hard to follow and very dull and painful to watch. How this movie was ever up for a award is beyond me. Movie skips around in time from present to past to present but with no notice and very hard to follow story line. Save your time and watch something eles this is not worth the time or energy to follow this movie. Wish it was better because just loved the casting and scenery. But story line left the movie smelling like bad eggs."
1,It only hurts when I laugh . . .,"What you have here are good looking people we care nothing about. Preachy, wannabe chic, just plain crap.It's not the actors' fault or the director. The story is meaningless. Okay, I laughed through the whole miserable film, but was that the intent?Cheating has consequences. I get it. Actions have consequences. Deep, huh?From the reader to the green-light guy . . . are they zombies? What were they thinking? Or smoking??? It reminds me of Tim Robbins' character in The Player who gave the go to an inane movie about the DA who falls for the lady on death row."
1,A big disappointment,"With such a great cast, how could this movie be so boring, unbelievable, and depressing? Ugh!"
1,The Worst movie ever,This was the most degraded garbage I ever tried to watch I got halfway through and was so disgusted I shreded the disc .The constant swearing and vulgarity were totaly uncalled for.
4,Look Closer...,"I'd give this five stars, but although I play a cynic on TV, I'm actually a gushy romantic...and this movie is many things, but romantic? Not one of them.That being said, there's a lot of good things going on here. The cast, in addition to being overwhelming beautiful, is really spot-on. Natalie Portman steals the show, but all of the four leads inhabit their characters with force.The story is every bit, or even more, subversive than you might think, and I loved that. It was somewhat over-the-top...but not really. Real life, oftentimes, is darker and crazier and more painful than most films are willing to portray. Kudos to the filmmakers for daring to go there."
4,honest/dishonest...,"I'm not sure I have ever watched a film that was so brutally honest, yet, simultaneously, incredibly dishonest. By that I mean, this is a honest depiction about how horribly dishonest we can be in relationships. Therefore, I kind of loved/hated it. I give it 4 stars because it stays with you. It's hard to watch this and not be haunted by it."
5,My favorite movie of all time.,"When asked what my favororite movie of all time is, I always name this movie. I then explain it is a drama, at which point my male friends stop listening, because they assume ""drama"" means ""romance.""While I would possibly call Closer a love story, I doubt you'll ever manage to find a less ROMANTIC love story.Cheating, lies and secrets are the heart of this story, but as the lives of the main characters are followed I am captivated every second.My favorite character was Natalie Portman's Alice. I love her. She is an extremely interesting character.Actually, they're all pretty interesting. Or perhaps what is interesting is the way the characters are woven together.Whatever they did when they made Closer, they did it right.If you're in the mood for a light, fun romance, don't put this DVD in.If you're in the mood for a more dramatic but honest take on the games ""love"" plays on us, definitely watch Closer!"
3,People like this do exist,"Thought provoking and not for those easily depressed. It has a ring of truth to it as I have actually met men and women who are aggressive in the way they speak and manipulative in their actions such as the main characters in this film, regardless of their marital status, etc.So no matter how emotionally brutal this film may appear, it has a ring of truth."
3,"The world is full of imperfect characters, and so is this clever film","Great to hear others perspective on this arousing piece of film. As I watched, I wanted the relations to be triumphant. There is plenty of melodrama and passion, but little commitment much less love. Alice (Natalie Portman) is sexually stunning. She plays the seductress: able to capture a man's heart with just a single look. Interesting that despite her lack of worldly sophistication, education and financial status, Alice is the strongest character who will not compromise on love. At the opposite end of the spectrum is Larry (Clive Owen). Larry is manipulative and easily the most detested character. It seems that he is the only character that ends up winning. Larry's relationship is far from perfect, but he does mention that ""love is a compromise."" If you are looking for a ""feel good"" romance tale forget ""Closer."" The world is full of imperfect characters, and so is this clever film."
3,Does good movie = good DVD?,"Closer is a very emotional film that will move your heart. I really like how the story folds and how the 4 main characters are linked together. And the 4 starts all have amazing performances in the film. It is definately worth watching if you have missed it in the theaters.Then why only 3 stars and not 5?That is because upon reviewing the specs on this DVD release, I am a bit disappointed. Got to say I am a little spoiled by the standards nowadays, that I am expecting some extra behind the scenes stuff, or cast and crew interviews. But this disc provides literally nothing. No bonus features at all! Therefore, if you are looking for a good drama, Close is the one movie you should watch. However, is this DVD worth the bucks? That will depend on what you are expecting on a DVD nowadays. To me, I am going to wait and see if they would come up with another edition before purchasing."
2,Not a date night movie........,"Closer exposes with a totaly raw use of language the most destructive personal behaviour, short of violence I have seen in a movie about human relationships.This is a movie that is NOT for the faint of heart, what is more I am not sure that it entertains or informs, most of us never experience the limits expressed by the plot, or the vicious disdain the participants have for each other, all in the name of ""love"""
1,slow developing weird exotica,"Weird sultry erotica movie about cheating and sneaking around on your significant other. Unfortunately it is a depiction of todays relationships. Good actors, and acting. Very slow developing plot, and poorly concluded. I wouldn't recommend it."
3,chick-flick tolerable for guys,"first off, knowing this is a cliche, this is my first review. i dont like to rant on the internet because its pointless. this movie has its moments and i really like the title song. clive owen is not a miscast...repeat clive own is not a miscast. he really carries the movie and his scenes are by far the most entertaining. he plays a scum bag doctor and plays it to perfection. really an unbelievable cast and the more i see this movie, the better it gets. and this was a movie i hated after seeing the first time. for a chick-flick, this movie is tolerable for guys because of owen. he is one of the most underrated actors of our time."
2,Why?,"""Closer"" made me wonder: Why do I even bother watching movies? The nearly two hours I spent watching this could have been spent ... washing my hair? walking the dog? pondering life's many mysteries?But NooOoooooOOOOooooo ... I had to spend that time watching the brutal interactions between four physically-appealing people talking trash to each other and always wanting that which they cannot have.If you must see Natalie Portman and Julia Roberts in action, then watch this film not for the plot - which is transparent and cliche - but the ideas and questions that emerge. For instance, are people today taking intimacy for granted? When does emotional intimacy merge into falling in love?I could go on and on, but I will end with one final note: I liked how ""Closer"" had only a smidgeon of revealing flesh and sex scenes but left me feeling like I had just licked the pavement of Bourbon Street. Take heed. Words do have power."
3,How People Sabotage Relationships,"I like that this movie recognizes almost nobody is completely innocent in love. Most adults at some moment use and abuse sex for short term needs, lonliness, insecurities, frustrations, boredom, to assert their independence, or even to hurt a third party or to settle a score. It also shows how the obsessive need to ""spill your guts"" or know ""all the details"" can destroy what might have been a lifetime marriage (the movie argues some old secrets have to be kept out of pity or gratitude) I did however think the sexual component was way overemphasized though. It's as if none of these adults know which bed they want to end up in and insist upon making it miserable once they finally get there. There is a great story to be told about fidelity and loss, but ""Closer"" doesn't quite achieve it. Nice try."
1,wasn't impressed,I found this movie very boring and hard to keep up with. I just kept waiting for the ending. My favorite part of the movie was when the credits started rolling.
2,"Well acted, with no other redeeming qualities","I understand that movies are changing and that not all movies will have a happy ending, I welcome that in fact. These are not real people unless real people are stupid, heartless masochists. There is shock value to this tale of infidelity and deception, hearing Julia Roberts describing to Clive Owen what certain male secretions taste like is almost worth the price of admisson. You should leave after that scene because it just gets worse from there. The charcters in this film are like hypersexual 16 year olds with money and no parental supervison, write the script from there. This is not even close to reality nor is it entertaining or interesting to watch. This is just a disgusting car wreck of a movie you should avoid."
1,Don't waste your time!,"This movie is a totally disgusting waste of time and talent. It's bad enough to finish Mike Nichols illustrious career. The actors should be ashamed to have wasted their time in this clueless, plotless piece of trash."
1,Worse than one star.,"The buzz I remember from this when it was a theatrical release was how Natalie Portman's nude scenes were cut. Aparently they also cut the interesting and engaging dialog also. This could not have been any worse if they cast the teletubbies as the 4 characters as the actors. For the guys out there the strip club scenes did not have any nudity. Not that a film needs nudity, but this was a symptom of the pollitically correct crowd ruining a film. Not at all believeable acting. This film should be banned as a terrorist act.I hated it, and threw out my copy, rather than sell it and subject someone else to it."
1,it can't be julia roberts,"i couldn't belive that julia roberts would involve in this boring movie ,the story is clumsy and you can't understand what they realy want,or what kind of message the director wants to deliver,,,to cut it short it's aloser movie."
3,come closer,"actually i waited very long time to watch this filmbut i must say that i m disappointedi don t know why,but i thought this film is like ""Notting Hill""but the film is far from thaton the other hand,the actors are fine.and it was fun to watch"
2,Gay film without courage to show last reel,"A storyteller does not introduce a gun early in a plot unless some character will use the gun later. In ""Closer,"" the two men have cyber-sex, and by the film's climax fail to go into the actual physical act. This is a stag-fest, yes, but it is not about the women who are little more than pawns used by one man to attract/repel/attract the other. Finally, when Clive Owen tops Jude Law in the dermotology office, the encounter is a reduction to language and not the action that the men's opening engagement should lead to. This is a tale of how one man Tops another--minus the courage to show it in a post-gay world. Anyone familiar with D. H. Lawrence knows where this story is going. Think of the famous last line in the Ken Russell film ""Women in Love."" The wife asks: ""Aren't I enough for you?"""
2,Great acting but poor script,"Many reviewers here expressed their dislike for the characters portraited in the movie. I think however unlikable the characters are in any movie, the storyline should be coherent. It is not the case with this movie... While the acting was fantastic, the connections between each ""section"" of the movie were weak, unconvincing and required a lot of contemplating by the audience. I watched the entire movie against the wish of my girlfriends as they wanted to cut it half way into the movie. This is not a chick flick or suspense or your cookie cutter type of drama if that is what you are looking for."
2,Not a chick-flick,"Where I agree totally with the review by Eric Mattina ""Eric"" in his breakdown of the movie; this is not a movie for the morally sensitive (like me). Closer was exceptionally well acted by beautiful actors who play unlikeable characters.This sort of brazen explicit sexual conversation and unresolved, stupid, loveless, sexual game playing is not what I go to movies for... perversity, sadness, and destroyed lives I see every day in my workplace and with aquaintances... I did not find this movie, with some of my most favorite actors, entertaining at all and should have saved my money! Some issues are best left in the closet unless the film maker is going to offer some solution for the darkness of reality.Mr Mattina gave Closer 5-stars, I give it 2 for the same reasons! Acting is great, story is disgusting."
1,Complete and utter garbage,"I have never in my life seen such a piece of garbage parading around as important cinema! The dialogue could have been written by a 10 year old for all of the depth the script contains. The issue is not the sexual content or swear words, it's that the movie has no soul, no irony, no layering, and essentially, no point at all. Even worse, it is very self-important, and tries to portray all of this meaningless as some sort of ""depth."" Ha! There is not a single iota of meaning or character to be found anywhere in Closer. Just actors staring deep into the camera trying to look, well, ""deep.""One has to wonder just how much Jude Law, Natalie Portman, and Julia Roberts were paid to appear in this rotten tomato.This is easily the worst movie I have ever seen. Ever."
3,Why did I buy this in Blu-Ray?,"Plenty of reviews of the movie already, so either you like it or you didn't. I couldn't really see any reason to have bought this in Blu-Ray. There were no alternate endings or anything, it's just a drama, so the graphic impact of the upgraded player are minimal.... This seems like a waste of money when a regular DVD would have done just as well."
4,Closer,The movie was great and so much I sent my copy to my daughter in the military. The price of the movie was greatDiane
1,"""...everyone loves a lie""","It's not a good sign when you watch and movie and think ""the stripper is making the best choices."" It's about a sad bunch of people who are wasting their time, and unfortunately, yours as well."
1,not worth they hype,"with all the rave reviews i kept hearing i expected to really like this film. unfortunately, it was a big waste of money and time. the characters didn't have much chemestry other than overdramatic sadness and rage. the one delightful exception was natalie portman who was a joy to watch. every other scene drained my patience. if you want to watch beautiful people cheating on each other, run out and see this movie. otherwise save your money."
1,"Go far away from ""Closer"".","This has got to be the most overrated movie of the year. I suppose the acting is good, if you like to see four great actors play characters who are so personally unattractive; not physically but morally. The characters vie with each other to see who can be the most selfish, cruel and/or pathetic.So, it's adapted from a play. So what? If I'd seen this play, I'd gone outside at intermission, vomited and ran as far as I could from the playhouse.Unless you ""get off"" on misery and hopelessness, you'll avoid this film. Whoever thinks that this picture has anything to do with reality is badly mistaken. Perhaps one trillionth of a percent of people in the ""civilized"" world behave the way these pathetic four behave. GO FAR AWAY FROM ""CLOSER."""
2,"static, superficial, boring, often ridiculous","Boy was I disappointed by this purportedly ""deep"" film. It is about relationships between silly self-important yuppies, with few real responsibilities except to their careers and their fantasies about themselves. None of them care particularly for the ones they are involved with, but instead are consumed by their own ideals of love. So instead of working on their relationships, they seek perfection. This has been done before, and better by others. The only thing that saves this film from total mediocrity is the actors, who really are good. It's just that the script offered little and the direction virtually nothing.Nichols is mainstream, but wants to have the cache of an Indie filmmaker. Alas, he can't have it both ways and so relies on stars to sell the film with their sex appeal. Idiotic, stilted dialogue passes for depth, and abrupt time shifts - where relationship shuffling must be explained - destroy the realism.Not recommended."
3,Great Performances save this film!,"This movie is hard to follow. No question about that. Most movies that are adapted from Broadway plays don't fair well on screen unless they're made from the classic playwrights (Tennessee Williams, David Mamet, Eugene O'Neill, etc.). Many of the negative reviews here on Amazon.com expecting more action are justified. However, I found the movie to be better than expected. Mike Nichols is one of Hollywood's finest directors. And with four of the best actors around, he does very will with the challenging subject matter. Natalie Portman has become the ""Harrison Ford"" of the Star Wars genre by breaking out into a great Oscar nominated role. British TV star Clive Owen also breaks free of his shell with his excellent performance. Juila Roberts & Jude Law round out this excellent cast. If you can stay with it for the performances, you'll be amused."
4,How NOT to act in a relationship,"In a twisted way, this is a date movie, because you can talk about why people sometimes do such terrible things in a relationship. Halfway through, I was ready to leave out of disgust because I thought this movie was simply people treating their lovers etc. poorly... then I realized that it was the point of the movie. A great take on the emotional distance people on occasion deliberately put between each other."
4,Great Acting,"This movie was good, at least in my opinion. Jude Law and Julia Robert's character's seemed less thoughout and unrealistic compared to Natalie and Owen strong presences. I loved these two charcters more for the vunerability that they showed then just for the fact that they both get screwed over by their love interests. I would recommend this movie for the performance rather than the plot, the overall atmosphere of the movie and of course the music."
4,"Compelling, honest and - hooray! - adult","Clever and insightful, ""Closer"" is a romance for adults. It is serious fare. There is nothing cute or cloying about it. If you are searching for happy endings, search elsewhere.When I say that this is a romance for adults, I mean that you have to be at least 25-years old to appreciate this story of ill-fated, star-crossed and double-crossed lovers. It's far too complicated for the teenage crowd.In London Dan [Jude Law] meets Alice [Natalie Portman] literally by accident. A year or so later, Dan meets Anna [Julia Roberts]. He is attracted to her, but when the relationship doesn't work out, he spitefully arranges a meeting between her and Larry [Clive Owen]. Larry and Anna click. The story then gets complicated.The four stars give awesome performances. Except for two walk on roles, they are the only actors in the movie. Natalie Portman makes excellent use of a role that should propel her career enormously.Highly recommended for adults."
2,Poor Relationship Film,"It was truly painful to watch the four very fine actors in ""Closer"" struggle through a lackluster, tired and emotionless script. This sort of fair has been done before, many times and on many levels much better. ""Closer"" appears to be nothing more than an ultra modern, suave John Hughes film, minus an engrossing script and likable characters. John Hughes films were by no means masterpeices, yet they were entertaining. ""Closer"" is not effective on any level."
1,Huge disappointment!,Sadly I bought this movie. Could have watched a couple hours of soap opera for free. Just people cheating on each other and then cheating on each other. I wouldn't even give it 1 star....but I had to click on something.
1,Boring,"This was one of the most boring movies I ever saw! It makes the word love truly just a ""four letter word"".I even brought it to work and let my coworkers borrow it to get their opinion. Only one out of six said it was worth watching. I gave the movie to them!"
2,5 Stars for the Movie; 2 Stars for the DVD,"This DVD is not worth the money, it's as simple as that. The only special feature is the music video for ""The Blower's Daughter."" There are no commentaries, no behind-the-scenes featurettes, no interviews, nothing. I'm sorry, it's just not worth it."
1,Truly Horrible Movie,"This movie just makes you feel dirty. You leave it not liking a single character; some have said it's real life, but not my real life people. There is no reason to screw anyone over as terribly as was portrayed in this movie. Don't waste your time. I'm glad I checked it out for free from the library."
1,One Star For A Pretty Cast,"Please, we humans have this thing called 'free will' and when our actions might hurt someone else we can use it to say 'no'. Aw, everyone was sad, big whoop. Cry me a river."
3,Unsettling film that neither soars nor crashes.,"""Closer"" is definetly a film that is hard to characterize. It is a icky movie about four bad people who are so miserable that they only desire to make others miserable. It is not a film worth seeing in theaters but I would not discourage it from being rented. The reason I am giving this film an extra star is that natalie portman and clive owen are great and hopefully they will be noticed for it. Roberts and Law are also good but this film skips long periods of time that often leave the viewer disoriented and confused by what they are watching. There are also many scenes of obscenities which I could have lived without. NOt very good but not horrible either."
1,104 minutes of my life that I'll never get back,"Maybe I'm just not PoMo enough to ""get it""? I found this to be a boring, depressing, narcissistic movie about boring, depressed, narcissistic people who should really just DIE ALREADY so I wouldn't have to listen to them drone on and on in clipped, See-Spot-Run sentences about how boring, depressive, and narcissistic they are."
2,Closer is...distant,"Three or four big-name actors (I only recognized 3) could not save this pointless movie.All the characters were lying, cheating, shallow people. They played with each other's emotions for fun, went on power trips, and generally acted like asses. (Sort of like ""Hurlyburly"" in that respect - lots of angry, pointless talk by similarly unlikable characters played by big-name actors.)The acting was OK, but the script gave the actors nothing to work with. Julia Roberts was not convincing as a photographer, and Natalie Portman's stripper character never actually strips though I knew that before seeing it.I found myself checking the clock at about the one-hour mark...not a good sign. I give it 2 stars only because it was well-made and someone involved must have thought they had a decent movie in it somewhere. I failed to find it, though."
1,Boring!,The movie is so boring. I don't care about the subliminal messages that it has about the characters & that we are and do what we say we won't. Not worth being bored. It's so slow paced that it renders any point being made worthless!
2,Low on character development,"A portrait photographer and a dermatologist/internet sex enthusiast. A failed novelist and a stripper. Closer is about the interactions between these two couples - their infidelities, their fights, their loves.Despite a talented cast, the characters are so thoroughly unlikable (the men crude and boorish, the women weak and forgiving) that I couldn't force myself to be interested in who might be cheating on whom. Their switches back and forth seem to go on endlessly, leaving a viewer begging for release with an end."
3,'Closer' is both Good and Bad,"This is an odd movie; one worth seeing, but not buying. Natalie Portman is completely unbelievable as a stripper. I don't understand how she was nominated for an Oscar. I think she really whimped out in not having any nude scenes. It only made the character less believable. Mike Nicholas, the director miscast her. Julia Roberts looks very, very homely, and I am being kind, yet the 2 men in the movie keep saying how beautiful she is. Jude Law is good, but Clive Owen if terrific. He commands the screen, and is the main reason to watch this movie. He is sexy and doesn't make a false move, well maybe one, where he tells Alice to stop smoking. Anyway, I didn't believe the storyline one bit. It was absurd, but somehow it is still an interesting movie. The scene between Law and Owen on the sex website is hilarious.PS If you are a Clive Owen fan, buy 'Beyond Borders' with Angelina Jolie. He is so good that words fail me, and the movie, despite bad reviews, is very entertaining."
3,Remarkably Awkward,"The best thing about this DVD turned out to be the ""extras"". Damien Rice performs the film's theme sound ""The Blower's Daughter"", a beautiful MTV type clip set on an ocean beach. Damien serenades a beautiful woman, with ""unrequited love"" written all over it.The four actors in this DVD are great on their own, in other films. Closer, however, proved to me that great actors can deliver stilted, awkward lines if a script is poorly written enough, and if the direction also adds salt (to the wound). These four very handsomely, beautiful people end up acting out a ""modern love story"" so neurotic that the-new-twist-on-the-love story just fizzles out. It wasn't so bad that I stopped watching it, though, I did laugh at the unbelievably artificial lines."
3,Movie Hard to Follow,"I wanted to see ""Closer"" because I love all the stars of the movie. Also because it was directed by Mike Nichols who has done some very good movies. I think I have to blame this on the editing because it was very hard to follow. It is a movie that was very hard to understand and follow but it did have the good vs. evil plot on every person'a life. It skipped around in time and place like it was just a random story about these four people and I really like a movie that has a definite beginning and end. I think you have to be a big fan of all the stars and the director to enjoy this movie, but I would not recommend it to everyone."
3,Less than the sum of it's parts - a cinematic iceberg.,"I wanted to like this.But in the end I thought that it was a cold and inorganic piece of film, and that they didn't have the time to develop the warmth and character which would have made this interesting and moving.It was a Love Rectangle - not uncommon in film. But I thought the people were fickle and changed their minds too often to be believable. It was like watching a game of relationship-chess which lacked impact, despite all the hard words spoken.Worse, these expert actors didn't seem especially convincing. Crying on cue is difficult, but the trick is making someone believe that you're really devastated - and the material didn't work for me and from there the tears and emotion also felt like a trick. Without sincere Love, the chess game has no solid goal and no sense of loss. This had neither.Oh well.."
2,"Even when all the Ingredients are right, sometimes it goes wrong !","Good Cast, Good Director, Good Story but what happened? This is a bad movie. Julia Roberts is not believable in her role, Jude Law is irritating, Clive Owen is miscast and Natalie Portman is just wonderful! The story of two couples whose lives are intertwined with a complex sexual infatuation with each other. The story lacks the tension and the chemistry is non-existant (especially between Julia R. and Clive O.) I gave it one star for Natalie Portman, who gave an excellent performance and the other for the title song (Blower's Daughter by Damien Rice).This movie bored me to tears.."
3,Song in opening credits?,Does anyone know the name of the song or artist who sings the song in the opening credits of Closer?
2,Disappointing,"Story is good in theory but comes across as a little confusing due to time shifts that are not always easy to catch. One scene jumps a whole year and one of the couples have got married in that year. It takes you a while to work it out.I watched this with 4 other girls and we were all bored because there was a lack of anything going on, or when it was, it was too predictable. I thought this would be a tense psychological thriller.Big disppointment all round, glad I reneted instead of buying it."
3,chaosprincess,"How much did Julia Roberts get to use such filth? I went with my mom and my sister and well i have to say i was enbarassed to say the least a lot of the conversation did not fit the scenero, and I felt it was a waste of a good actor Clive Owen, and I think Jude Law who i think is a great actor was miscast. The real ""movie star"" here no doubt Natalie Portman. I would rent it before actually purchasing it."
1,They Missed the True Coupling Here -- The Two Men,"The hetero musical chairs pairing of the two couples seemed to me to be a lot of sublimation over the fact that the true passion in the movie (and the only passion that came across effectively on screen) was that of the two men for each other.The two men also ""met cute,"" one pretending to be a woman in an internet chat room asking the other how big his ""endowment,"" and the other, in his haste to dodge work-related phone calls (after all, he was on his computer at work), couldn't type fast enough and claimed to possess over 9 pounds of manliness!They enjoyed nothing more than taunting each other with tales of conquests of the other's (however temporary) female love interest.I truly expected them to have a ""Brokeback"" moment but, then again, it was a Mike Nichols script!"
1,HORRIBLE,"DEPRESSING, DEPRESSING, DEPRESSING. NO PLOT. A HORRIBLE MOVIE and I canNOT believe this has won any kind of award. They're using wonderful actors in such a completely stupid movie and plotline. HORRIBLE!!!!!!"
1,Meh...,"I watched a total of 20 minutes of this movie before I had to turn it off. I rented it because I've seen many movies with Portman and Law and liked them both. I don't know if it was the dialog or what, but NONE of the characters seemed believable to me at all. Portman just didn't cut it as an ex-stripper (not to mention the badly dyed hair in the beginning). And Julia Roberts as a photographer...I just didn't see any of them as being their characters, maybe I was expecting more out of Portman and Law. If you liked any of their older movies, and are seeing this because of them, skip this one. You'll most likely be disappointed like I was"
3,Sin Comentarios,"Esta pelicula del diantres:-pBueno, la peli me dejo esperando otra cosa,Y me tenia haciendo bolas en el sofa;Siempre era un drama, un lio, etc.Quizas no pudo ser peor.Quizas fue mi gusto."
1,z-z-z-z-z,Does Natlaie Portman have to be in every frigging movie these days? And Julia Roberts- I though we were going to get a break from her too... let alone Jude Law. Hollywood attempts to do something artistic and intelligent in the line of French or independent films and again falls short. There are some moments of sexual tension and near excitement but unfortunately Natalie Portman does not get naked despite what some of the other reviews say. Julia Roberts plays the same chick she plays in every other movie except maybe Pretty Woman. Although this film attempts to be directly sexual it is not that imaginative and never hardly profound. It's ok but don't get too upset if your local video store is out of it- you can wait to see it- trust me.
4,Another mystery set in Antiquity,"The ""hero"" in this mystery is a freedman turned mosaic maker who is uncreatively called ""Libertus"" a name that basically just means ""freedman"". The mystery and the way it is solved isn't particularly complicated; it seems more a matter of luck and logic than investigation as is the case in books by Steven Saylor. Unlike characters in Lindsey Davis' books, the ""hero"" and his own slave, Junio, are both likeable and you want them to succeed. Rowe has done a good job of trying to explore how Romanization affected distant parts of the Roman Empire as well as exploring the reality that slavery was a social institution embraced and used by everyone, ex-slaves and freeborn, wealthy and poor. What would be truly interesting and difficult to do would be to have a slave who is a ""hero"" in these ancient mysteries, someone who could really explain this darker institutioin that seems so favored to modern authors yet so distant from their experiences."
4,The Unchanging Soul Man,"Otis Clay sings in front of a devoted Japanese audience and gives the performance of his life. He sticks to the style that made him - raw, passionate, Southern-style soul that sounds like it was born in Memphis. His intense singing shows his gospel roots with His Precious Love included on this disc. Other highlights include Holding On To A Dying Love, and the O.V. Wright song, A Nickel And A Nail. This collection is an excellent overview of his hits. It was recorded in 1983 and has the core of the band that backed up Al Green in the 70's. A good place to start if you're new to Otis Clay. There's no one like him!"
2,Should have been TV movies...,Have only watched Crash Landing so far.. pretty stupid. Things are done in this movie that couldn't BEGIN to be real. If your really bored and its sitting there.. ok then watch it. Buy it?? Nope don't go there.I think the earthquake movie IS a TV movie... better than CL I would imagine but nothing to get excited about.
5,Very Good Phone System,Having 2 handsets is great. (or more if needed) Very easy to program with a lot of options to choose from if you want to. Good value for the price!
5,Great phone system!,"We purchased this system after a long search and love it. This is very easy to install and we love being able to change the ring to a melody rather than the normal sound. The idea of having a second phone that doesn't need to plug into a telephone jack is great. Our house is 3000 sq. feet and the second phone is upstairs while the main base/unit is in the kitchen. We have had NO problems with signals, sound or anything. This is a great buy!"
1,I can't use it in 75% of my home,"I have had this phone for a little over a year now and I am in the market for a new phone. This phone doesn't work in most parts of my home and my older cordless phone never had this problem. I have to stay in certain areas to make a call otherwise the person I am talking to can not hear me at all. Matter of fact it sound like I've hung up on them, but I haven't and I can hear them talking. The base is in the kitchen and just the other day while I was a foot away I kept cutting out. They have continued to get worse,if people can hear me my voice sounds like a robot. My sister has the same phone but she has different problems. When she is talking people can barely hear her. She called Panasonic and they told her how to fix it but it didn't last long and now nothing works to fix it. These phones were a huge disappointment."
5,sweet little package,"Especially for the price - My mother was getting booted off her internet because her old cordless ran on the same frequency as her wireless router - living on a couple of acres and doing a lot of gardening, she gets reception across half the property - a great buy."
2,Crippled my DSL,"When I plugged this phone into the wall jack, my Verizon DSL speed dropped from 1.5Mb/s to 37Kb/s. That's a 98% loss. I use the speed check at the National Science Fdn, but I didn't need confirmation - it died. I unplugged the phone, re-booted the modem and the DSL is right back up to 1.5Mb/s.I am surprised, because I read a lot of reviews before buying and some specifically touted this phone for use with wireless networks.It seems like a nice phone, thus the 2 stars, but I'd rather do without voice than internet, so back it goes."
5,"Go for Panasonic, you won't be disappointed.","Love this phone! This replaces an AT&T 2.6ghz set that I had for about 5 years. I decided after scouring the reviews to go with Panasonic KX-TG5432M. Wow! I have been using this for several days and am impressed by the clarity of reception, ease of programming and comfy size/weight. I also got a headset accessory Panasonic TCA60 (Thanks to a reviewer recommendation) which works really well, callers on the other end don't know that I'm even using a headset. Go for Panasonic, you won't be disappointed."
3,Nice phone - but volume too low.,"The phone is nice and so far I haven't had any problems with it. The only complaint is that the volume is too low no even at max setting, especially when using a head phone."
2,I will never buy Panasonic again.,"I used to love Panasonic products, but their product lifespan has been getting shorter and shorter. This product broke down very soon after I bought it. The previous Panasonic cordless phone with integrated answering machine that I owned, Model KX-TG2383, stopped working in less than two years. Panasonic products have great features and work fine in the beginning, but the products are terrible when it comes to longevity. They break down very soon after the warranty expires. What is worse is that, in my experience, the Panasonic company does not stand behind its products after the warranty expires. I, an old fan of Panasonic, have decided never to buy any product they make again."
3,Not impressed,"The range is terrible. Our old cheap 900 MHz Uniden has twice range. The features sounded perfect for our application. One handset was to be used by my husband when he is working in a detached garage at our house. The intercom feature would have been great had it worked. The garage is less than 200 feet away. That said, it is not a bad phone within the house but one of the handsets does out perform the other in sound quality."
4,Panasonic,"I like this brand of a phone. I mean it has all the feachers you need in a phone; such as, caller ID, Answering machine, voice enhancer, lighted keypad, sp-phone, lighted LCD screen, 5.8 GHz, and many more."
5,Best Phone in the group period !,"Been use this phone for several months brought a used one actually, really don't know why so many people selling this phone? i don't see any weakness this phone, this phone has all feature u need for the price ranger, possible best looking in the group. Small size like this is good u dont wanna be too small like cellphone lol. great speaker qualitty, answer machinese, good ring tone. U won't regret getting this, battery life is also great !"
1,WASTE OF TIME,"This book is nothing more than advertisement for her husband's accomplishments. She should have titled it ""Rich Woman: Marry an accomplished man and then make money by helping him make more money."" She does not appear to have any ideas of her own. The book is FULL of typos that a simple proofread should have caught. I do NOT recommend wasting money or time on this book. I am very tolerant of things I read, but this one is absolutely infuriating."
1,snooze,"I only got about halfway through this book. It was boring and not useful at all. It was just Kim telling her story, not giving advice. Just a self-absorbed try at getting more money out of a book deal. Not useful at all."
2,LAME,"I understand the title is ""Rich WOMAN"" and that it is geared towards a female audience, obviously, but some of the examples were a little off target for me. I am a 24 year old who has always supported myself, looking for something that would help me better my financial intelligence and understanding. However, this book considered ""women who's dream husbands divorced them"". What? THAT is not why women should be fully financially literate, just in case their ""plan"" to marry a rich guy falls through. I think bringing the fact that women live longer then men is completely irrelevant to FINANCE. If you picked up a finance book geared toward men (what I mean is a book not SPECIFICALLY geared toward women) there is none of the nonsense. I wanted a female perspective, but was definitely not expecting or appreciating what I got. Read ""Cashflow Quadrant"" by Robert Kiyosaki- best one in the series. Now they are just getting out of control."
1,not real advice.,"I read this book with an open mind. I ended up frustrated.The first thing that struck me was the repetitiveness. She made a lot of references to Hawaii and the 'old days'. That didn't interest me, it almost irrelevant. i don't want to know what her friends are up to either. the book is basically about herself.The most disappointing part is no real advice. Save your money people. I feel like I just got scammed."
2,Just common sense,"The first half of the book tells the author's story in an entertaining way but I jumped past all that and went to the meat of the book. What she has to tell is just pretty much common sense if you have bought and sold your own home and know how real estate investment works. She gives some good advice if you are ready to put in a lot of hours and hard work and don't expect to make a living from it too soon, maybe never. She uses a lot of pump-you-up hype in her story style so try to look at the facts and stay grounded in reality."
1,Absolute fluff - nothing to learn here folks,"Plenty of good books out there about investing, and even plenty about women and money. This isn't one of them. Save your $$ for somethign that actually teaches you how to get your money in order and begin investing. Jane Bryant Quinn is a good place to start - her books are smart, easy to read and actionable. This book is fluff like her husband's rah rah spouting that is bereft of anything actionable and really off the mark in many ways."
5,"Excellent - ""Must Read"" for anyone!","What an amazing book! I believe it's not only for women, but anyone should read this book. The fact that it is for women, is really phenomenal, because it is written in a very simple-to-understand way. I love the concept Kim chose to write it. It is so understandable, and I could picture myself in a round table discussion like the ladies in the book. What delivery! Excellent, life-changing, thought-provoking! One of the best investments ever!"
2,extended autobiography,"90% of this book is about Kim and her husband and how they got to where they are. There is very little information on how to actually go about investing. She's a good cheerleader, not so good on passing along good advice."
1,Lighter than air,"A very superficial book, 36 chapters in just over 300 pages.Each chapter merely introduces some basic formulas or theorems.Nothing truly useful. Very disappointing book.I feel sorry for the student who must use this textbook.See the excellent book by Prof. M.J.D. Powell as an example of how the subject can and should be treated. There you will be enlightened."
5,Evokes a sense of North America's (recently) lost Serengeti,"Kurten at al have described the wonderful variety of large mammals that lived in North America for millions of years, until as recently as 13,000 years ago. Saber- and scimitar-toothed cats, camels, sloths, mastodons, lions, cheetahs and other animals combined to make North America a teeming home to large game more diverse than Africa now has. Many fine illustrations accompany the text.The book is well-written, easily accessible to the interested lay person and does not require college level understanding of morphological bone analysis. Having been to southern Africa in 1997, I now cannot drive or hike through rural North America without imaging mammoths, tapirs, bear-sized beavers, one-ton running bears, and glyptodonts coming to the watering holes and browsing and grazing their way across the landscape.For a comprehensive college-level treatment, see ""Quaternary Extinctions,"" Paul Martin and Richard Klein, editors."
5,A very important read for all who are in relationships,"This book is as important as ""Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus"" in helping us understand our relationships. For anyone thinking about his or her past or present relationships, this is a must read, And it is a FUN read. While the topic is handled seriously and innovatively, it is still very compelling and very enjoyable. You'll laugh, you'll cry, and you'll probably gain new and wonderful insight."
4,Highly Motivational,"This book just makes the reader want to jump up and do better with his or her life. I've read mostly the way through and haven't had time to pick the book up to finish it. It does dare the reader to finish the whole book in one read, which isn't hard to do (it should take about 3-5 hours depending on your reading speed). I recommend this book to anyone who has kids or even adults because it will give you some advice and tips on life."
3,Shoes to Die For,Shoes to Die For is the second novel that I have read by this author. It seems like much of the text is cut and paste from the previous novel. An okay mystery that kept me wanting to know who did it.
3,Has potential,"Ms. Levine has a great sense of humor. This book is a quick, fun read if you are looking for something that is completely mindless. I would have preferred to see a little more substance...to say it is the proverbial cotton candy for the brain might be assigning too much nutritional value."
4,Good for easy reading enjoyment,"I like Ms. Levine's books a lot mostly due to the main character's ability to laugh at herself and the world around her. But some of the ""quirks"" do get tiresome - for instance, the references to the cat always licking herself in intimate places is funny enough the first time but gets old pretty quickly. And the ""Ooops, I said it, no, I didn't"" routine starts to grate after the ninth or tenth time. And always coming up with a cutsie name for the cat food begins to wear thin almost immediately. But the retirement home characters are funny, the communications with Jaine's mom and dad are funny and sentimental, and all around, these are easy to read, easy to follow mystery/comedies that are easy to enjoy. I recommend them."
4,This is Good,"""Shoes to Die For"" is the fourth book in Laura Levine's Jaine Austen mystery series. I have read the prior three, but you don't need to read them in sequence. Jaine Austen is a freelance writer of business slogans, resume's, and brochures. She is single and likes it, and lives in L.A. with her cat named Prozac. When she goes in a trendy boutique to see about an advertising job, someone is murdered in the shop that night. An employee, whom Jaine likes, is accused and asks Jaine's help to exonerate her. Characters are well done and hold your interest. The plot is good. Hardly a page goes by without a laugh, or at least a smile. This is a light, fast read that keeps you turning the pages 'til the end. Good climax. I enjoy Ms. Levine's wonderful sense of humor, but I thought in this book there could have been a little more. This is one series you can count on to entertain."
1,BIG disappointment!!,"Terrible. I had NO idea this would be a juvenile book written specifically for children. When I heard Mr. Levine on the radio, this was not mentioned. It's so boring, I couldn't continue even though his spoken message was excellent and one I had hoped to learn more about in the book."
4,A Book for all Ages,"Have been trying to find out more about ADD, Dyslexia, Dyspraxia and other Neuro disorders and this book, which is actually a text book for school children is great for the younger set to understand that they ae not alone and also for someone as old as I am who just now started questioning why I have always felt so different."
1,"Warning, don't buy the HAP422","My last air purifier lasted 16 years, a HoneyWell; this one lasted 1 year then it just quit working, no power no nothing. Holmes/Sunbeam promptly sent me another unit which was a plus on them for the rapid response. But then the second one stopped working just shy of being 1 year old. This time Holmes/Sunbeam warranty serviced was horrific, it took 4 months to get a replacement sent after numerous emails and phone calls. Finally yesterday they apologized for the delay and were going to send out an upgraded model HAP424 for my troubles.The HAP422 seemed to filter the air good enough though not as good as the old HoneyWell, but way better then the Ionic Breeze which was a joke. Now time will tell if the HAP424 is just a glorified 422 and will last a year or so; but this time I won't have a warranty on it since replacements are only warrantied from the time of the ORIGINAL purchase not from the time of the warranty replacement. This one fries and I'll go back to HoneyWell."
3,"One gem, one piece of garbage","The 3 star rating for this double feature is mostly on the strength of Salvage. It is a micro-buget film that works. It starts off like a film that completely blurrs fantasy and reality. Then with a plot twist worthy of M Night Shyamalan, everything falls into place. It is almost a 4 star movie and it easily is worth 3 stars.I will be generous and give Mortuary 2 stars but it comes close to getting only a single star. It tries (I think) to be a mixture of comedy and horror. But it does porly on both counts. Tobe Hooper makes a great film every decade or so but this is not one of those. It never explains what is happening. No loss though, I wasn't interested anyway."
1,These 2 movies are the worst horror movies I've ever seen,"The image is of very poor quality, even though these are blu ray discs , a problem that it's not so uncommon as you can imagine/think."
2,Cool hat but quality bad.,I bought this hat cause it really has a cool logo and I loved the fact you just don't see it everyday. Anyways soon after I recieved the hat I began to wear it. It seems thicker than most hats and I really enjoyed wearing it. unfortunately on the 3rd day I had it I has pulling the brim on the cap and the back part where you size it snapped off like a twig. I didn't even really tug hard. Anways it ruined the cap and looking at it i see it was somewhat cheaply made.
2,What's the secret?,"I can't find any videos on You Tube re its usage. The manufacturers want payment for their video. I find it difficult and frustrating to use. The split disc back-pressure dial is very simplistic. If the dial covered a graduated slit, it would be better. Its not easy to cover the separate holes when you can't see them clearly. I can buzz the mouthpiece better without it. When making notes on the instrument the vibration of the lips is aided by the natural response of the tube length. On the BERP you simply buzz the pitch. It doesn't happen for me. I know that different people have different physical abilities, I don't think mine suits this item. I'll keep trying. Perhaps I'll get the hang of it. Personally I think blowing your horn using as little lip pressure as possible is much more useful. The P.E.T.E. (bought at the same time) makes more sense to me."
5,Awesome!,"This is so much fun to use. I am impressed how it is helping me as a trumpet player. I will say it is much more useful to use with a properly tuned piano, which I don't always have access to, because it can really train your ear to pitch match."
3,My LIfe as a Man in Chaos,"I must read Phillip Roth's books, but this one is hard to getinto. The reader needs to know that the first two stories inthe book are drafts of a novel by the author described inthe third story. Everybody is named Zuckerman. I'd suggeststarting with the last half of the book, then reading in order, reading out of order, or skipping the first two stories.Please review it here if you read it ""out of order."" Thanks."
2,Just plain Yuk,"Smell isn't too bad but when cleaning the box, especially where the cats have urinated, the litter sticks to the scoop like wet cement. It also adheres to my cat's paws."
1,Bad Odor develops quickly despite frequent daily cleaning,"I have one cat and two litter pans. For the first few days this litter performed well and my cat liked it, however, after less than a week it developed a strong sour animal shelter stink that quickly pervaded my house and offended both of us. My cat would stick her nose in a pan and sneeze violently before leaving. It became clear she was holding herself rather than use it so I quickly found another brand.I must mention these litter pans are cleaned promptly every time the cat uses them so they are both near immaculate most of the time. I gave this litter a point for low dust but it had really poor odor control. It was closer to odor amplification."
2,Very dusty product,"Although it seems to clump well, it is a very dusty product (all versions that I tried), despite the claims on the box. After using it a while you will notice a layer of dust on surrounding horizontal surfaces. You also breathe the dust when you clean your cat's litter box."
2,doesn't clump firmly,"This litter is pretty cheap as well as readily available, but I hated it. It doesn't clump very firmly at all, and I ended up needing to change out the whole box after only a week or so (I normally do this much more rarely) because the broken-up clumps became evenly distributed throughout the box and the whole thing smelled. It's pretty lightweight too and scatters easily."
1,Don't buy arm and hammer,"As you know cats have their noses in everything, I bought arm and hammer cat litter and found that it had a lot of dust in it. The dust got in my cats lungs and I had to take him to the vet because he couldn't breathe. He was put on antibiotics, He got so bad I thought he was going to die. Both my cats are inside."
2,inadequate odor control,"I have to agree with other reviewers. The odor control and clumpability of this product leave a lot to be desired, especially in the corners of the box. If I fail to clean the box out for a day, the corners become super-saturated because that's where my cat prefers to winky tink, and it stinks to high heaven.The litter itself is unfragranced, which is absolutely essential as the fragranced products give me a migraine. I've switched to the unfragranced Multi-Cat Arm & Hammer litter. It controls odors a lot better without adding an obnoxious odor of its own."
1,Terrible product,"I agree with the other reviewers. This product is just like old kitty litter...no clumping whatsoever. You won't be able to scoop any clumps. The urine-soaked grain just pours through your scooper. I can't believe they call it ""Super Scoop"". Major fail."
2,Not a good litter,"This is really not a good litter at all. I used it briefly when I first adopted a cat. It clumped fine, but did nothing to cover the smell. Anything arm & hammer I've tried other than their plain baking soda has been very disappointing. You can check my reviews for better. Fresh step was much better at clumping and covering the smell. I would recommend precious cat now due to the large amounts of dust from fresh step."
5,Favorite Litter,"I have a lot of pets and have tried many different litters, I always go back to Arm & Hammer. I think a lot of people think a good litter should mean that you don't have to clean the litter box as often, this is never going to happen. With regular scooping, this litter can remain odor free for up to 1 month. After that, I completely empty and bleach the boxes and start fresh. It clumps well and I like that it comes in a recyclable container, cardboard. I usually buy the multi-cat, but I really have not noticed a difference among the types."
3,sleepy,"I can't remember the last game I played that actually put me to sleep. It's not that bad of a game. With lack of a Japanese language option it takes a little getting use to the English Voice Actors. And at some point in the game you end up with all 6 characters in battle at once. a little easy for those hard-core RPGers (and a little annoying...they don't even all fit on the screen) the scenes are beautiful, but I think the characters could use a little work. I can only play it for about an hour at a time before I have to set it down in favor of something else to keep the day going. (Or I get the urge to watch the anime) I'm not thrilled with this game but I'm not disappointed with it either. It's going to take me a LONG time to complete it though.It's really not a bad game, but remind me to play it only when it's close to bed time."
3,"A fun game for Inuyasha fans, but not much merit on its own.","This game is just what you would expect from an anime-based RPG game. A basic plot, mediocre 3d graphics and animation. It's not much of a challenge, either. I don't believe I lost a single battle through the entire game (with the exception of battles that were impossible to win for story purposes).This isn't to say it was all bad. The scenery is nicely done (though the forest paths get recycled a lot), and the story is kind of interesting too. More or less, this game is an interactive version of the anime. The game isn't designed for serious gamers who are looking for a challenge, but if you're just looking to immerse yourself in the fandom for a bit, it's worth looking into. Perhaps rent it instead of buying it."
5,RPG,"I am a fan of Inuyasha. This is a great Rpg. Voice overs on the characters by the original actors. Good storyline. This is a traditional RPG. This game has all the main characters from the 3rd season except Kagome's family (see credits). You are able to make combo moves with another character depending on your friendship. This has a high replay value due to the numerous events and intervals. There is a New Game+ feature. This feature only increases your character levels to 30. The Bonus Menu keeps track of all the secrets you've uncovered in the game. No matter how many times you play the game, the Bonus Menu doesn't get erased. It is only erased when the file on your memory card gets deleted."
5,The best game!,Do you like Inuyasha? Then you MUST get this game! Your characther is practiclaly liek Kagome..coming from a different time and all. They have the orignal characters voices and everything....it is just a really cool game..I'm going to be up all night playing it
1,Big Let Down,"I love all things Inuyasha. So I was very excited when I got this game. But it let me down. It's extreamly slow, the booklet is not very helpful and I just think the characters look goofy.And I have already noticed many errors in the game. Such as if you choose the male character he is refered to as a ""she"" the whole time. I collect anything to do with Inuyasha. But as much as I hate to say it. I think I may be taking this game down to the game exchange. I agree with the others who said spend your money on the PS1 Inuyasha game instead. This game is not even close to what I had expected it to be."
5,YAY,"i cant wait to play it.. i am a big fan of kouga, naraku, and miroku, so those are prolly gonna be the ones i play...^_^ hope to play it soon.."
3,It's possibly okay.,"The intro takes a while to do, and the dubbing is terrible. I really wanted to get it, so I did a test run on my friend's. ( I am a HUGE Inuyasha fan!!!) I must say, I was disappointed. I found the first part: Demon:*disco dude accent* Roar! I'm gonna eat you!Girl: Oh no! You're going to eat me...!...........Pathetic, I must say. I did fid the way that you could hang out with the IY cast cool, but the way they talk, (i.e. charater appears, text appears,) kinda old fashioned. I adore the chibis. I LOVE them! They are so amazingly cute!!! I'm not sure what to say about this game, but it's only for the super Inuyasha fan. Seriously, you have to really like it."
4,If you like playing with your eyes closed...,"The game play is lame. I have actually discovered that you can YOU CAN LITERALLY WIN MOST BATTLES WITH YOUR EYES CLOSED, PRESSING ONE BUTTON OVER AND OVER. Only the major climactic battles require any thought at all, let alone strategy. I am a fan of the TV series and I found the story to be intriguing and amusing at times, but much of the time it was pretty predictable. This game would be a total waste of money for anyone who is not a HUGE fan of the show."
3,You Knew What Was Coming,"I'm 22 years old and I must say that I love this game. And I'm not sure even why. The graphics suck. The camera angles suck. The maps are non-existent. But nonetheless, I still find the game compulsively playable. For those of ya'll complaining, you knew it was gonna be like it is before you bought it. If the concept of the game didn't tip you off, then the pre-release screen caps should've. Overall, I enjoy the game and I love Inuyasha, but the aesthetics of the game suck badly."
3,ummm this game is so-so,I just beat the game today and i have to admit i had a lot of fun but i wish the ending was better. In this game you can choose many different things much like the Final Fantasy RPG's and your choices reflect greatly on the outcome or ending. I beat the game as the Female character and got the miroku ending it wasn't as good as i expected though. When you first start the game it can be really boring but don't let that fool you it gets really exciting and the anime scenes are great.So give the game a chance though the graphics are chibi kinda of like harvest moon games there are kewl anime battle scenes that make up for it. [...]
2,Disappointment,"Perhaps I'm too old (lol, 23 - old?!) ...perhaps I've been jaded by bad plotlines in the Inuyasha fandom (from fanart to fanfiction to filler episodes that seriously lacked) but I've had my time in RPGs, and this game made me yawn. I adore Inuyasha, but from the moment I turned this game on, the only thing I could think was... ""Wow, how UNORIGINAL.""I think that if I were still in my early teens (which - I think - is the average age of the Inuyasha fan?) I would have enjoyed this game more, but it wasn't very engaging, the ""animated"" dialogues made me wince (for a PS2 game, I think they could have done a BIT more with the movement at least...)I've just seen too many games that had better composition and more detailed design to be able to give any good points about this game.Sorry guys, but unless you're looking to collect all things Inuyasha, this game isn't quite worth buying. The best suggestion would be to rent it first to see for yourself."
5,I love Inuyasha... and Shippo.. They're so cute!,OMG! Can't wait til' this game comes out. Grr... only three more days. Three more days. I love watching the anime and reading the manga. So now I can't wait to actually play the game.
3,This game rocks!,"...If they had kept the original voices. The English VAs can NOT act. No doubt they will ruin the game like they ruined the series. Besides that, The game is great! Nothing like Miroku asking you to bear his child. ~_^ ""watashi no ko o unde kudasai"" XD"
1,"On the spot ""Your Shoe ""Y.S.P"" !!!","I have never read a better review for a game than the one that ""Your Shoe ""Y.S.P"" made for this game. I have only heard of Inuyasha by reputation but I have never really had the chance to see it. I bought the game thinking that it could get me started and give me a that head-start for the series. The begining of the game looks like a mini clip from an anime (which it was nice, probably the best moment of the game)until you get sent back in time. Anywayz, I'm not an RPG fan but I love FF and Kingdom Hearts. This game, on the other hand, was really a waste of time. What really did it for me was the very frequent battles. Something that could take you maybe 30 min. it now takes 3 freakin hours because every 5 sec. ur doing another random (yet similar) battle.Its a very basic RPG game, with not a lot of thought put into it nor a compelling story and extremely annoying."
1,"Less talk, more action","And what about the graphics????As a strong IY fan, I was looking forward to this game.We bought it some years ago, and I've just now gotten around to playing it a bit.I say a bit b/c I cannot stand another 30 minutes of it. Deformed graphics, waaay too much talking thattakes forever, no real action. Seems geared to the very young kiddie set. I just can't take this seriously,but I am seriously disappointed."
5,The Title Says It All,"This is a book which might well bore the serious student of Latin for whom it was not written. It serves well those who have never studied Latin: here you can find those maddening phrases which appear in literature, tombstone epitaphs, legal documents, medical records, etc. Anyone who reads will find this book a ~sine qua non~."
2,Not what the item title indicated,"This is an answer key, but there are no tests included. What I received was in good condition and quick service. I just thought I was also getting the test booklet. Apparently it is a seperate book. I am disappointed that I now have to go looking for the test book for an additional price."
4,good,"I received the item quickly and as described. I do hope on future listings you will include the edition number. Some of the practice set questions change from edition to edition, therefore I did not get the exact match to our textbook."
3,Gunplay.,"The plot is incomprehensible. The acting average. The special effects laughable. Yet, this flick is eminently enjoyable due to the outrageously bombastic gun battles. An action movie with some terrifically entertaining mayhem, NEMESIS is worth the ten bucks."
4,Action-Action and oh yeah hot chicks!,"I seen this movie about ten years ago, and I couldn't wait to see it again. These kind of movies are best (""B"" movies) are best with too other B's. Beer (of course) and my Babe (wife/girlfriend--or both, just not at the same time). Just another mindless killing and hot chick movie, so what, that's what watching movies are all about--right?"
4,Nemesis,"Saw this cult movie over 25 years ago, and looked all over for it until I found it on Amazon. No surprise there, of course. Delivered promptly from the seller and I enjoyed the movie just as much as I did all those years ago."
3,quality not so good,"**Actual physical box/dvd**The box it came in seemed cheap. The insert in the box looked almost like a good photocopy. There was nothing else in the box except that little insert and the dvd.**The movie itself**The movie, while sounding very unique and intriguing, is actually fairly meh. I think my expectations were just too high. It's a B or C sci-fi flick. It had a lot of potential that didn't pan out. Robot movies are totally gnarly, but with this one I was disappointed.**Overall**This was not worth the ~$20 I paid, but it is out-of-print, so I guess this price is expected. Other places were charging over $50 for it. Out-of-print or not, it's not worth ~$20 to me. If it had been $10 I think I would have given it a 4/5. I wish I could have just rented it on Netflix."
1,Not worth the time or money,"For some reason I thought this movie was going to be good the second time around. I saw this movie when I was younger and didn't really remember what it was about. So when I saw that it was for re-sale, I jumped on it and brought it. The movie was full of bad actors and the story line was confusing. Not to mention that the price was way too high. Don't waste your time."
2,What had happen wuz!,This movie started off great until they ran out of money! The First 30 minutes was off the chain! I don't know what happened next? I think some off their financial backers did not come thru with the cash; or they spent all the money in the first hour!
1,overrated,"I was deceived by the cover text. This movie purports to be a ""cyberpunk thriller,"" but if you started thinking William Gibson, Bruce Sterling, Neal Stephenson, Wilhemina Baird, Melissa Scott, etc. etc. -- think again.A few cyberpunk SF buzzwords are tossed into this incoherent flick to fool the reviewers. In fact it's just another Z-grade actioner starring a bunch of body builders, fashion models, and plenty of large projectile weapons. Plenty of explosions. Some very low cost locations. Some very bad dialogue. At least the cast got to visit Mauna Kea :-)The movie has a few moments of self-conscious humour and a few moments of cinematic style, but mostly it's just the same old same old -- if you loved Van Damme in 'Cyborg' then you'll probably like this one too. If you were expecting something cerebral, moody, and noir -- forget it. If you like breaking glass and amazingly ineffectual automatic weapons fire, grab your popcorn and enjoy."
2,violence!,Fans of Olivier Gruner are going to be deceived. No kickBoxing or shotokan karate in this movie (or very poor). Only shooting and extreme violence. What is the point of shooting a woman a hundred times! Even if she's a cyborg! Fans of violent and sci-fi movies are going to be served!
4,Serious Machine Guns,"The world has changed. 2027 Los Angeles, Alex (Olivier Gruner) battles for the future of humankind, but who is the real enemy? The machine-gunning is heavy-duty! Tactical weapons buffs will enjoy seeing the serious hardware. Also satisfying is how well the ladies handle their guns. Cyborgs vs. humans, who will win? A total classic from Director Albert Pyun. The ""Java"" scenes filmed in Hawaii feature some beautiful landscapes and waterwalls. A clip of Rio de Janeiro and the ""Cristo Redentor"" statue prefigures a scene where Alex looks like Christ after his flogging. Can the world be saved?"
5,Classic Gospel At It's Best,"Now back in the 80's I can remember when this album first came out. On our way to church the DJ played ""Unspeakable Joy"", and we almost had to pull over because of the presence of God filling our souls. ""Give Him The Praise"" has such a funky groove to it, but the call to give Jesus the praise will have u lift your hands in submission to the Lord. ""Glad That He Lifted Me"" will make u pat your feet and get up and dance before Him. ""My Soul Is Anchored is ont of the most ""covered"" songs in gospel concerts and ""afternoon"" services that I almost got weary of hearing it. But once you met Jesus you can identify with the singer. I recommend this cd to all gospel music lovers. I appreciate the older stuff."
5,Great CD!,"I have this and I love it!! You'll realize how unimportant and foolish a lot of worldly issues are. ""My soul has been anchored"" is my testimony. And, for the record, NO ONE sings it like Douglas."
2,Not Often Played,"This is one CD in my collection that does not get heard very often. The guitar of Kid Bangham is the highlight. Sugar Ray's voice is also a feature but overall the album lacks punch with often a poor choice of songs being the biggest reason. The best track is 'F.Bee Bailey Blues' which features excellent harmonica from Sugar Ray, piano from Anthony Geraci and guitar from Kid. Definitely on the R and B side of blues."
5,EVERYONE SHOULD HEAR THIS!!!!,"This album is so great...Everyone should have this cd in their collection.There is not one weak song on this cd and vocally Arnold is definantely one of the best.My favorites on the cd are: SHOOTING STAR, CLOSE TO HEAVEN, LOVE IS HEALING & EMILY...but all the songs are excellent.People..wake up...LISTEN!!!!!!Everett in CT."
5,you have to see him in person...,"All I can say is wow! He has such a powerful voice and a sound that compliments my musician's upbringing. His material is smooth and stirring. It would be nice to see him headline. In a time of so many cheap acts, he gives me hope that good music is making a return. Check it out, listen to the clips, and definitely pick up the CD. You'll find yourself bumpin it in your car singing along :)"
4,Pretty Good,"My wife liked Arnold as a backup singer on one of James Taylor's songs, so I decided to get one of his albums for her. What an enjoyabe experience! His vocals are smooth and soothing. You may not want to jump out of your shoes, but you will relax and smile when listening to this CD."
2,A failed movie,"I loved Solaris and Stalker. Even more, 90% of the movies I watch are world cinema classics: Bergman, Fellini, Dreyer...But this is absolutely too pretentious and falls short to guide through some spiritual journey. I think Tarkovsky failed in his attempt to create a parabole of the meaning of life.Another point I'd like to stress here is that at times, the movie seems to pray tribute to Fellini (8.5 comes to mind), only to be a dry parody of Fellini's dream images, filled with genuine mediterranean sensuality.I recommend not to watch it, as simple as that. I had a hard time before I watched another movie after Nostalghia. It is intensely boring, exasperating and void.The only way to go through this movie without throwing your DVD out of the window is by skipping the first 65 minutes. They are completely a waste of time and unbearable. Then you will watch a 60 minute movie with some beautiful images and a sort of meningful ending. Try it this way if you prefer."
5,Overwhelming,"I saw this beautiful film a month ago, and it still haunts me. I recommend it to anyone who understands cinema is art -- especially those who appreciate Campion, Greenaway, Jarman, Kubrick, Lynch, and Potter (reminiscent in its careful photography and leisurely pace)."
1,The DVD quality is not good.,"This is one of my favorite films, probably my favorite one, but I couldn't enjoy watching it in this format (Korean DVD version) because the quality of the DVD transfer is so poor. I can't understand what some of the other reviewers are saying about the picture being good, it is quite a bit worse than a good quality VHS you might have purchased of a new movie in 1990. The aspect ratio seems to be distorted as well, the picture appears squished.Nostalghia is a truly classic film, an important work of art, and it is a real tragedy that there is not a good quality DVD or Bluray edition available for people to buy and watch."
4,Not so scarlet women.,"This collection of stories is extremely well written by a variety of respected artists. Most of the stories could hardly be called scarlet; they are in fact often depressing. Some are amusing, Woolcott and De Maupassant, for instance, and Noel Coward, of course, is always charming. It is good bedtime reading as the stories are brief and do not induce nightmares, although a few tears are likely."
2,Same old story...,"I am sorry to say this set is poor. The evidence for any of the claims made of occult roots is scanty, if indeed there is any. Each episode overlaps with the same footage (the footage you do see is ok which is why I didnt give the set 1 star).For a much better picture ofNazisms occult links, read Goodrick-Clarks book on the subject which gives a much clearer picture."
4,"Good, But Not What I Was Expecting","When I ordered this DVD, I had in mind a three-part documentary I saw on the Discovery Networks several years back; that one opened with black-and-white footage of a Nazi-sponsored expedition to Tibet, and the sight of several Tibetans, either bemused or puzzled at the interest of a group of foreign scientists in the sizes of their craniums, for example, to tell whether or not said Tibetans had ""Aryan"" ancestry. The final part of the documentary ended with the torchlight ceremony where the torchbearers formed into the shape of the swastika. This DVD wasn't it, but it was interesting on its own merit."
4,Official histories omit this info -- Why?,"This is a great addition to my collection. I've always been curious about the Nazi phenomena, and I've always wondered how the most civilized country in Europe at the time could have descended into such depravity. This question has never been answered to my satisfaction--until now. This DVD collection gives us a look at the mindset which made Nazism possible; it was a mindset where the values of Judeo-Christianity were replaced by the values of occultism, paganism, mysticism and eugenics. This gives rise to another question, however. Why is this aspect of Nazism so completely ignored in traditional and official histories? It makes you wonder. If you're a student of this period of our history, I highly recommend this collection."
4,Informative but basically misleading,"There is a fundamental problem with this series of documentaries. By focusing on the relationship of the Third Reich to the occult, it makes it appear as if the occult were the only source of Nazi ideology. Actually, important sources of Nazism lay in political theories that are ignored in this documentary, and some Nazis were far less interested in the occult than others. So this series is often quite correct in its information but the information gives only part of the picture and is therefore misleading."
2,Interesting topic: very poor archival quality and sound,The concept of this video is interesting to say the least. Himmler's attraction to the occult and mystic ceremonies explains alot about the various rituals that were conducted by the Nazis during the Third Reich. But the very poor quality of the archival footage and audio tends to take away from the overall story line..
3,Where is occult???,"Rather sympathetically depicting the SS sexy boys known for animal deeds both in eastern and some western parts of Europe, this British movie is surely of a general interest because of merely narrating historical facts a Nazi murdering machine was established.There is something missed in this product much less grasping attention than ""Triumph of the Will""."
1,So Occult You Can't Watch It,"The information presented in these films is interesting and useful to anyone who wishes to understand the cultural underpinings of Nazism. But if you buy the set, be sure to save both the shipping list and mailing label. I found the technical quality of my copies so poor I could not watch them all. This was due to a defective product. Unfortunately, it was some days before I discovered this and by then the packing material had been tossed out."
3,What the heck is this?,"I got this as a gift. What the heck? Somewhat interesting, but also quite goofy. I'm amazed that someone made this, and even more amazed that someone bought it! It does have a niche market, I assume, and probably is quite good to those who favor Nazi Occult mythology.I only wish they had a section on Nazi UFO/Spaceship technology. They went to the moon in '44, you know. Really!"
3,"Interesting footage, some of ot repetitive","I have mixed feelings about this release. There is some interesting (non-combat) footage on these DVDs, like Nazi parades of medieval knights, lots of early Hitler shots etc. The theories presented are interesting, although some of them seem a little far-fetched with too little proof. The main downside is that all the material could easily have fit on a single side dual layer DVD, especially if all duplicate scenes were removed. This really upset me, some scenes were a case of uneccessary copy&paste, it is annoying to watch the same footage with the same commentray you just watched on the previous DVD. At this price, I can still recommend it to all people interested in WW2, this is a sort of behind-the-scenes, focusing not on the battles fought but on the mad fantasies leading to WW2."
2,MORE ADVERTISING THAN BRIARDS! HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED!!,"What's cooking!? In order to understand the above, let us look at the quote which appears on the back cover of this book: ""This book, illustrated with over 175 full color photos and drawings, presents sensible, easy-to-follow recommendations about selecting and caring for a Briard."" What this author conveniently forgets to mention is that 3/4 of this book is comprised of GENERALIZED CANINE TRAINING & PRODUCT ADVERTISING. I was dumbfounded at how little this book actually delves into Briards. Here's the breakdown: The entire length of the book is 192 pages. 62 of which is solely focused on Briards. The remaining 128 pages deals with PRODUCTS, TRAINING & GROOMING TIPS, that can be applied to any canine breed. I was highly disappointed, considering that books on this breed are scarce as it is."
1,Briards,I found very little about Briards and more of a general book on dogs. I was quite disappointed actually. Since I own a briard I was looking for something specific about the breed. I have found more at various web sites than in a book on the subject!
1,Very disappointing!,"When chosing our first dog I researched several possible breeds and got my information from books, breeders and the internet. This is one of the books I purchased and felt very let down. There is very little information that is specific to the breed but lots of advertising, especially for Nylabone products which my dog hates. If you really want good advice from someone who knows and understands this breed, contact Briard Rescue. The lady I spoke was happy to answer all my questions, gave me the most accurate and helpful advice (on the breed and breeders) and even invited me to meet her Briards. Don't waste your money on this book. PS I did chose a Briard and she is wonderful!"
5,Who's Joe?,"There's nothing mysterious about the ""closed society"" of this film if one has any knowledge of American history, literature or film of the 1930's and 1940's. In short, this is a terrific, romantic adventure story whose stoic characters cannot hide the emotions bonding them together, no matter how hard they may try. A quintessential American classic."
3,Toy Airplanes,"I will start off by saying that this movie did keep me entertained througout. Although I was starting to become impatient because it definitely could have used some trimming. I also think Jean Arthur, a lovely actress and comedienne, was mis-cast. There was also some very poor acting from a very fresh faced Rita Hayworth. You should also be ready to accept and overlook that the special effects mainly involve toy airplanes landing on model sets. There is one fairly exciting action scene when Barthelmess lands and takes off from a small stretch of land to rescue a sick man.Jean Arthur later commented that she felt Cary Grant was constantly up-staging her by blocking her out of the picture. She also stated that she was threatened by the beauty of Rita Hayworth. Just something extra to watch for if your so inclined."
1,One Book You Can Judge By Its Cover,Unless you're an all out scientist - and I'm not - this is one of the most tedious and excruciatingly navel-gazing books in existence.
3,"OK....but you need an amp, the bridge always pops off, and the strings never stay in tune.","This violin is alright. The bridge seems to aways pop off or shift causing the strings to go out of tune. The bow that comes with it is nice and I use it as a spare for my acustic violin. Overall, there are much better ones out there but they are alot more expensive."
1,Blowing in the wind,"Rynne offered the world a liberal fantasy of what 'the spirit of the Council' was all about. Acording to him, the council was pastoral, but not dogmatic. How then to explain those dogmatic constitutions on the church and on relevation, with all those troublesome endorsements of Trent and Vatican I? According to him, the council was about openess, freedom, and tolerance. But the Council's claim of the Catholic Church to be the true Church founded by Christ and of the duty for all Catholics to assent to the teaching of the magisterium on faith and morals somehow gets lost.The book has interest as a relic of mid '60's liberal dreams. But for those of us who have given up our love beads and our sandalwood incense, it's all a bit embarrassing.For a better take on the Council, read Wiltgen's The Rhine Flows into the Tiber."
1,Weary History,"Xavier Rynne is back with his liberal cartoon of the Council. The Curia wear the black hats; people with German and French accents wear the white hats. Vater Rynne confuses what the Council actually said with what he wished it had said.For a better grip on the Council, read John Paul II, one of the great heroes and interpreters of the real Council."
1,you are the consumer...,"First, I love A.F.I, but I would not own this if you gave it to me. Why? Because just like it says, it's unauthorized. I have seen it, and it's o.k, but there is some wrong information in it and like I said it is unauthorized. Should you buy it? Well, if you like A.F.I and don't mind stealing from the band by buying an item which they will not benefit from when it's marketed solely as an A.F.I item, and don't mind some wrong bit's....then go for it. But personally, to me buying this is like stealing music online that a band didn't release, it's incomplete and it's thievery. It does not matter if A.F.I has a bunch of money now or not, the production company that put this crap together has more and you are just padding ""their"" pockets, not the band who deserves the profit's."
4,Police Academy 2: Their First Assignment,"A bit of a disappointment seeing as the Beautiful tough Blonde and the fake hispanic don't return along w/others, except brief appearances of the academy's head from the 1st part,Nonetheless,Most of the Same cast is here, Bubba Lewis,Guttenberg, and now an Addition a semi-funny Goldcat.The magic is still there albeit away from the Academy,of course they couldn't stay forever there."
3,THE BEGINNING OF THE SEEMINGLY NEVER-ENDING SEQUELS,"AFTER THEY'VE GRADUATED FROM THE POLICE ACADEMY, THEY'RE CALLED IN TO STOP A CRIME WAVE. OK SEQUEL, BUT LIKE A LOT OF OTHER SEQUELS, IT CAN'T MEASURE UP TO THE ORIGINAL. BUT, I'LL TELL YA THIS. EVERY SEQUEL THAT CAME AFTER THIS ONE GOT WORSE AS IT WENT ALONG. THIS IS THE LAST OF THE GOOD POLICE ACADEMY MOVIES. THE DOWNFALL STARTED AS SOON AS THE NEXT SEQUEL CAME OUT."
5,the first in many,this is the first sequel of PA and it is pretty amazin how many have come since notto mentio the tv show. they must have done something right in the begining and this is it very funny movie
1,Steve Guttenberg is HOT!,"Man, Steve Guttenberg! Whatever happened to him? He is the best actor I have ever seen. Three Men and a Baby and Short Circuit are some of the best movies ever. Police Academy 2 sucked, and so did the other ones, but that's okay. GUTTENBERG FOREVER!!!"
3,"bad quality dvd, but a good movie.","I havent seen this movie in years. It was very nostalgic. THe only real extra is a thing where mahoney, proctor, and hooks talk about the movie, but it's only 10 minutes, if that. The video quality is pretty much the same as an old vhs. If you already have this on video, I wouldn't get this on dvd."
5,delicious,"These are the best dried cranberries I've had. They were fresh and slightly chewy, not so dried and hard you'd break your teeth on them like some dried fruits. Can't beat them for the taste and price. REALLY good."
2,MORE SUGAR please!?,"I saw the initial disclaimer touting No Additives, No Preservatives...Etc...I should have scrolled down more to see THE SUGAR content in the ingredients..."
3,They are really sweet,"Maybe it's my fault for not reading the description well enough, but they are really sweet. Without a sweet tooth, these were hard for me to eat. Plus, I didn't think to check if they were organic, which is a must for me and fruit. However, it's a large amount and goes a long way for the price. Next time I'd order unsweetened organic tart cherries (for inflammation) from another source."
1,These have changed for the worse: obscene amount of sugar.,"I've ordered theseTraverse Bay Fruit Co. Dried Cranberries, 4-Pound Boxfrom Amazon before and loved them. The most recent batch is completely different, though. Instead of the tart fruit flavor of before, these taste more like sugar than cranberry. They even have the crunchiness of crystallized sugar. Gross."
2,too sweet,These cranberries are sweeter and not as plump as OceanSpray craisins. I generally prefer dried cranberries to raisins because they're not as sweet--these are too sweet for me.
3,not as other reviewers say,i ordered these expecting them to be juicy red (i had tasted some at an office party and googl-ed and found these to be closely described)but these are the regular dried fruit with oil smell. they are tart for those who are looking for it but not what i expected.
5,best berries,"Hello all.These are the best and biggest cranberries on the market today. My college son brings friends over and they ask for these berries instead of chocolate. THAT is the the best review, huh!"
4,cherry review,"My family has gotten these cherries for a couple of years now on Amazon. They are SO good. They can give you gas if you eat too many at once tho- so be aware! :) But they are so flavorful and the deal is a breaker, better here than the home site. So fret not- buy!"
5,Good Berries,"I am pleased with the cranberries. Yes, they are sweet, but no sweeter than any other cranberries I've bought. Good price and arrived very quickly. I would buy these again and plan to try the cherries next."
5,Perfect food,"Does not get better than this, use these in any dish, high quality product, last a long time in frig,"
5,yum!,"great price, very deliciousI put the entire bag in my OXO air tight container. I add them to my cereal every morning."
1,CHECK THE SUGAR,"I would check the sugar grams before you buy and be forewarned. This seems a healthy snack but of the 140 calories per serving, 117 are from sugar! (26 grams) The Cherries and all others like this are the same.When seeing the deal, I thought what a great healthy snack until I looked at the calories and breakdown that includes how much sugar."
3,Not as much of a value,Four pounds for $18 (subscribe and save) wasn't much of a deal when stacked against Trader Joe's 8 oz for $2. I had expected bulk packaging to be substantially cheaper. The quality of the dried cranberries was comparable.
4,"Minimal sugar, but not plump at all.","I am a big dried cranberry fan. Unfortunately all you can find by me is Ocean Spray sugar crans, as I call them. Those are like eating a ball of sugar. I found a brand a few years ago that I love. They were plump with minimal sugar. Unfortunately I lost the name of the company so I was forced to give these a try. They are similar in taste with minimal sugar, but still not as flavorfull. They are also pretty lifeless crushed clumps. There is no plumpness to them. For now, they will do. I just hope I can find my original brand."
2,don't buy,"I ordered dried Cherries and got the cranberries. My mistake. I could not return them so we kept them They are no better the;n the cranberries I get at Cost-co. In fact the cranberries from Cost-Co are softer, fuller and richer. don't buy these!!! Save yourself the $$$"
4,Beat the super market prices,"These dried cranberries are excellent in baking and on salads. The freeze well. The online price beats the super market prices. Great product, great price!"
3,Not bad. Not special.,"I bought these along with the cherries. The cherries are delicious -- by far the best that I have had. The cranberries are just ordinary though. I don't like them any better than the Ocean Spray ones that I buy. I'd buy these again -- they were perfectly fine. But, not amazing."
3,A Let Down For Me,I came from Rogue Spear and Urban Ops and this game didn't measure up. The ruined the series right here.
4,Pretty Good Book,"It has a lot of good pictures of characters, but it never goes into the depth i wanted for the characters themselves, or on the Art of MAKING Game characters. But its still a good reference."
5,Loveeeeee it!!,"This product says it delivers in like two weeks and I got it in one week!! I love the scent, so pretty and sweet! You seriously get this huge bottle at a third of the original price!! As soon as I run out, I will definitely only go through here to pick up some more! This is the best deal for my favorite scent! Btw, you get so many compliments on this perfume because it literally lasts all day!!"
4,Evening wear,"Still is a very nice sophisticated scent if you like flowers like orange blossoms, roses, and jasmine combined together. I would say this is evening fragrance."
3,nice introduction,"This is a nice introduction book. It was a required reading for a class, but I have found myself referring back to it on occasion. It's useful for art students of many different levels and mediums.This is a nice addition to an artists library, especially an art student."
5,GREAT MODEL!!!!!!,"Hey everyone. If you want a model with out painting and with little gluing, this is it. The only difficult part I had was the distributer and the wiring of the spark plugs. I recommend this for anyone, beginner or expert model builders."
4,Detailed and fun model kit,"I bought this model after seeing it in a store. The store had it for $32 but I found it on Amazon for about $12.50. It is very detailed and pretty easy to assemble. My favorite thing about it is there is no painting required. I remember how much I hated painted models when I was younger.This model goes together pretty well but I did have to make a few alterations but nothing major. A few of the chrome parts were ever so slightly nicked up but again nothing major. Other than that it was easy to assemble with no problems at all.This is a skill level 2 model kit so advanced model builders wouldn't be too interested. I wanted a little project to work on but nothing too involving and this was perfect. It took me a week and after finding a display case to fit it into, it is a nicely detailed piece on my shelf"
4,Very nice,"Pros : Love the poster, good quality.Cons: Don't like all the ""white"" around the picture. The size made it difficult to fit to a standard matte without having to cover up some of the poster."
3,obviously an earlier work...,"Much as I love the Tintin series, this is one of my least favorite episodes.This was the last comic I needed to possess in order to finish off the collection. Sadly, I came away disappointed.The plot is simply bad. While Tintin is well-known for his intelligent sleuthing, this entire book revolves around luck and circumstance.This is not an adequate example of the caliber material we Tintin fans expect."
3,Better than Big Secrets,"The second book in the ""Secrets"" series is better and more interesting than the first but I still resist giving more than 3 stars since I know that information in his first book is false and therefore doubt is cast on all his publications.But nevertheless, this is the best in the series."

5,"Great, easy to read map!","I live about 30 miles East of New Orleans and am very familiar with the city, but I needed a map of the French Quarter and nearby areas as a reference for the novel I am writing. This map is a great tool for finding your way around the French Quarter, CBD, Warehouse/Arts District, and the Fabourg Marigny. It is very easy to read and is big enough so that you do not have to pull out a magnifying glass to see the smaller words. It is also laminated, so you can open and close it a million times and it will not tear.If you are planning a trip to the French Quarter and nearby sections of the city, this map will definitely help you find your way without much effort."
5,it's a good one,"I never get tired of this one. There isn't a single weak component. The bass guitar, vocals, and songwriting are great, and the drumming is outstanding. It's called ""suburban hyms"" but manages to not be bubbly major key pop about highschool or unlistenable emo-ish garbage about ex-girlfriends. It's solid rock 'n roll so there is none of the plodding slow droning to common in ""indie"" type stuff, but it has enough of an indie touch to keep the songs from sounding typical at all. The singer passes my standard test of singing in his own voice. He doesn't sound like he's trying to imitate anyone which for some reason is not the norm.I like it better than the singer's old band ""Shiner"" because it seems a little smoother and more polished to me. I really don't see how anyone could really dislike this one."
5,Easy to Love Shakespeare,"""Shakespeare for Dummies"" is a well-written quick education on Shakespeare's plays. In addition to a good summary of each play, it includes good data on the categories of the plays, quick reference on some of the less familiar words, and information on movie productions and best Shakespearean actors.(I wish that this book had been around when I was in high school!)"
3,Don't pay full price,"This contains 1985's Country Living, and 1987's In Store For You. The Gladiators were falling apart during these albums making an uneasy transition into the 80's. The song writing is slight as shown by the song titles, a little too much cheesy 80's keyboard.You are better served by Dreadlocks, Bongo Red: Studio One, or Trenchtown albums.These are okay albums, but not worth paying full price."
3,i prefer anna and the duke more.,this book was ok. but it didn`t have as much passion and dedication as anna and the duke did.
4,a great read,"i really enjoyed this book! i read it in one night! it all starts when eighteen year old Emily Fitzgerald is proposed to on a wager by Viscount Stanton. So she goes to SCotland to see her brother Ewan. When she first meets Jamie, Ewan's cousin, she thinks he's a servant. That's how all the trouble gets started. THen she see's him indecent swimming. then she insists he read's Scott's poetry so she has to help him with the pigs, and then they unexpectedly kiss. Jamie is totally and completely in love with Emily now. But is Emily? Or will Jamie end up with ANgrahd. When Viscount Stanton comes back, will Emily accept his proposal? To find out what happens read this great booK!"
1,book,"i was very dissatisfied when i opened the package. the book is in HORRIBLE shape. it is bent all around has writing on it absolutely EVERYWHERE, including the outside edge and is in VERY bad condition. it was NOT advertised this way, which is why i'm not pleased at ALL"
5,Great!,All the Mr. Men books are great! My 6 year old daughter loves them all. She's been reading them since she was 4 years old. She even has some in French from when her Uncle went to France a couple years ago.
5,Not bad...,"not bad for a bootleg. if you want to scare off would be trick or treaters on halloween, play this out loud, they'd think you're performing some ritual human sacrifice inside your house."
1,need more power,Was correct connector and voltage but insufficent amp ouput.I wish that the amp specs would have been posted on the product's specs page.
2,no accounting for taste,"I thought the voice of Holliday's character was unendurable. Crawford's character is entirely brutal and unlikeable, which doesn't suit a comedy, and the Washington tour was didactic and unhumorous. The only part that amused me was the physical comedy in the gin rummy game."
3,Gin Rummy Comedy!,"between the seXy sultry voice of Billie and the lilting tones of Harry's mating calls it's soooo hard to decide what provided more comedy lol.... well the answer is the card shuffling act!!! found the vocals so annoying but the history lesson refined and most unexpected, great tour of DC and learned a few things even after living there for a few years, abs no chemistry between Judy n Bill so guess I can recommend for Washington D.C. tour embedded in a dumb blonde stereotype reversal (amazing how Clark Kent glasses transform more than SuperMan!) and how hilarious congress could NEVER be bought.... now there's the comedy, Kukor had his hands full with this script, Bette was soooooo much more deserving of the Academy nod... prolly was thinking Drop Dead as her favorite line!"
2,beware of regional copies,"this DVD was a copy that will only play in a machine you can change the region on, this one was for europe. I had to play it on my computer. Some older DVD players will play these,just be aware"
5,Terrifically funny,"George Cukor's 1955 screen adaptation of a Broadway play. Beautifully scripted with stunning performances by Broderick Crawford and Judy Halliday as New Jersey shady scrap-metal millionaire and his truly dense girl. Crawford enlists the help of a sophisticated Washington journalist (William Holden) to ""smarten her up"". Unfortunately she gets too smart for his own good....Classy acting and a razor sharp dialogue make this my favourite film. Do not confuse the original with the witless 90's remake."
2,The case for this DVD is environmentally damaging,"This review is for the entire shopping experience and the physical item shipped by Amazon. If you are after a ""pure"" movie review I recommend you also see the 'The Internet Movie Database'.The DVD case is full of holes, is lightweight and flimsy. This of course, requires the case to be replaced with a more substantial one (with no holes) and the original case goes into a landfill.Light can also pass through the DVD case, which may shortening the life of the DVD.If a sturdier case with no holes were used this senseless waste could be avoided.I liked the movie."
5,Judy Holliday is GREAT!,"I LOVE this movie! I have long been a fan of ""Born Yesterday"" and have had to wait until I happened (usually by accident) to see that it was on TV... now I can watch it whenever I want. Judy Holliday is wonderful in this role. The movie is funny and also a bit intense, although not by today's standards. My 11 year old daughter also liked it! If you like this movie, I also recommend ""It Should Happen to You"", also starring Judy Holliday. The DVD is excellent quality. It was definately worth the money. ENJOY."
4,Pretty good and true!,"It's not as easy a read as Murder in Coweta County but still a good actual account of how America has had its pockets of crime over the years. This one account is chilling and you can hardly believe this sort of thing is ever allowed. I'm sure we've not seen the last of true accounts like this one but if you want an account that's easy to understand, this is a good one."
5,A great combo,"Pairing Bil Keane (Of ""Family Circus"" fame) and Erma Bombeck was a stroke of genius. These two work very well together - it's a shame they didn't do more work together.Of course, the title is the ""mother's curse"" - if you had a mom, you may remember her using that line on you. I often wonder if that's why some people don't have children.This book takes you thru ""expert"" advice - and than shows you how the situation plays out in the real world. If you are a parent of a teen, you may want this book just so you can remember they don't stay teenagers forever (they _don't_ , really - tho sometimes it's hard to believe).So get this book, find a quiet spot (HA! what's that, the bathroom?) and enjoy - it's cheaper and more fun that psychotherapy."
5,5 star comment,"The priduct arrived ahed of time, no problems, no disputeand your reply made me feel very plesed to contact you again."
2,"Mostly stupid, but a few funny spots","This movie was the absolute worst film from John Landis' otherwise respectable repertoire.Dan Aykroyd and Chevy Chase's comedic talents are clearly wasted by a [bad] script and paper-thin characters.The gist of the movie is that Alyroyd plays the straight man to Chase's character. Both are low-grade intellegence agents sent as decoys on a mission to launch a missile from the USSR in order to test out the US ""Star Wars"" defense system.In a thinly-disguised swipe at the ""Star Wars"" concept, the system misses the missile and nuclear war is about to ensue...The ending is both predictable and dumb.There are some funny moments, but when the highlight of the film is Bob Hope dressed like the late great Payne Stewart, you know there aren't many."
1,Intelligence insulting,"I was extremely disappointed with this film. It's a terrible shame because I love Dan Akroyd! It just wasn't funny at all. At some points I was bored to the point of wanting to go to sleep. Chase and Akroyd's characters never reached the potential they seemed to have at the beginning of the film, and the attempts at humor were ridiculous (in a bad way). I'm not sure how this has 4 stars here on amazon. I generally love comedies and am rarely ever disappointed with a movie, but that's exactly what happened with this one. Surely pass this one up."
3,quite weak,"The story is about special agents saving the world from some bad guys in the US government. The idea is similar to the 007 movies, but it is really not comparable. The movie is quite primitive, the story is predictable, the jokes are about old Cold War era stereotypes. The acting would be ok for some late night show episodes but not a full length movie."
5,Hilarious 80s Film,Dan Abroad and Chevy Chase at their best in this cold war comedy. Very funny movie you'll want to watch over and over.
5,Old movie still funny,Spies like Us is still a funny movie. The doctors greeting each other in the tent is one of my favorite movie scenes.
5,great movie,i own this movie it is very funny movie and if you are the type like to collect movies this is one movie you must add to your collection!!!!
3,Good movie,If you want to watch an old movie on a Friday night then break out the popcorn and go to town!
4,Spies Like Us,"Very funny movie, especially the written test scene where Chevy Chase cheats on his exam.Probably one of Chevy Chase's best movies, may be beaten only by Caddyshack or Vacation. A movie that I have seen a lot of times, and probably will see a lot more times."
4,"A HOPE/CROSBY STYLE ""ROAD"" PICTURE","Spies like us is a tip of the hat to the great Bob Hope Bing Crosby ""road pictures"" of the 1940's.Chase and Dan Ackroyd play two low-level CIA agents who are sent on a rather bogus mission in Afghanistan to basically be expendable decoys.The boys are dropped inside a giant crate from a plane and when opened, they are lounging about eating Doritos! So well do they play their Hope Crosby roles that there is a tribute of sorts to the old patty-cake game when they encounter a couple of Russian agents.later, in the tent of a shiek they have to pretend to be doctors and perfrom surgery. Bobe Hope himself makes a cameo appearance.Of course, the boys eventually are the heroes of the movie and get the girls. Funny movie"
3,Not Bad,"Chevy Chase and Dan Aykroyd have made their share of trash, but this Cold War spoof isn't half-bad. When supported by a solid script, or at least a promising set-up, Chase can be hysterical. And this movies gives him a lot of material to work with. The classroom scene might be the single funniest moment in Chevy's career. With the exception of Caddyshack, his timing has never been this pitch-perfect. Aykroyd, as usual, plays the slightly quirky straight man. Nothing wrong with that, since his better film work usually consists of fulfilling this role (Ghostbusters, Trading Places). Spies Like Us won't blow you mind, but it does have moments of inspiration."
3,Good movie- sadly DVD does not have a WideScreen version,This is a great movie for Chase fans - unfortunatley the DVD does not have a widescreen version of the movie. Which of course is the only reason for buying it on DVD! For this reason alone I have to take two stars off.
2,Great Movie - shame about the DVD,"Well it would seem that Warner Bothers have failed again to utilize the DVD format to it's fullest! The picture transfer is poor - in some places it's obvious that they haven't even taken the time to clean up the original print. Don't be fooled - 1985 wasn't that long ago! So this movie shouldn't look like a VHS rental copy on DVD! The sound is very much below par and there are no extras; no director's/actor's commentary, no cinema preview, no music clip by Paul McCartney etc (He did the song for the movie!). Overall, if you want a laugh and you see this version of the movie for a cheap(!) price - buy it. However, if like me you love this movie, I would recommend that you wait and hang on to your VHS copy in the hope that we get a 'Collectors Edition'. Maybe we will get lucky and someone from Warner Brothers will actually read these reviews!"
3,Could have been a better edition,"This is by far one of my favorite movies, and I have to say that I was a bit dissapointed that the folks at Warner Bros. didn't spend more time with added extras like ""widescreen"". All in all, I think it's a great buy."
4,"Chevy and Dan, Great Together","Just what you'd expect from these two comedic geniuses. A funny laugh out loud film that could be compared to ""Stripes,"" but much funnier in my opinion. This is a must see as it is a true Classic."
3,"Back when Chevy Chase was funny, but bad DVD","It's simple, a five star movie with a one star DVD rating. That's three stars!!!This movie is a CLASSIC and is very funny. This is classic Chevy Chase long before he did that terrible television show. Dan Aykroyd is fantastic as well. They just don't make movies like this anymore.The DVD isn't worth it. No special features, the picture quality is sub-par, and the sound didn't sound as good as it could. I kept thinking I was watching a VHS the entire time. If that version is cheaper, then get it on VHS instead."
3,I love this movie,"OK, its not great film. But if you are fans of Akroyd or Chase, or just like to gaffaw at silly movies, this one is a special treat. It helps knowing the people involved. For example, did you know that Donna Dixon who plays the seductive doctor/CIA agent is really Dan's wife! What about the fact that is was taking place in Pakistan, and drops geography names that are on the news now with the pending trouble in Afghanistan? I love the test cheating part, the UFO part, and the shootout at the outpost. Cheap laughs, but belly laughs. One of my arsenal of ""make me feel good"" movies."
2,The Road to Nowhere,"Chevy Chase, Dan Aykroyd and John Landis have seen better days. ""Spies Like Us"" (1985) fails to recapture the spontaneous humor of the Hope-Crosby ""Road"" movies. Bob Hope's cameo (his final film appearance) and Paul McCartney's title song remain among the few highpoints. A ""Saturday Night Live"" episode from the Chase-Aykroyd era delivers considerably more laughs."
2,Lame,"When John Belushi died in 1982, he left Dan Aykroyd with several scripts and the sad end to what could have been a great comedy team like Laurel & Hardy or Abbott & Costello.Aykroyd filled John's spot in GHOSTBUSTERS with Bill Murray and hit comedy gold.He filled SPIES LIKE US with Chevy Chase and came up snake eyes.View at your own risk. At least it's not as bad as NOTHING BUT TROUBLE, easily one of the worst comedies ever made."
1,"The ""Un-funniest"" movie ever made","This pathetic piece of film deserves to be in the scrap heap. It was the biggest waste of time and one of the least funny movies I have ever seen.I only purchased it because I am a fan of Steve Forrest (General Sline). He played the part very well, becoming a parody of his character.Dan Akroyd and Chevy Chase were not funny. Not one single belly laugh in the whole movie. Don't waste your time or your money. (Buy a little gem called ""The Whole She-Bang"" instead!)"
3,Not a Bad Time Filler,"I've certainly see Jaclyn Smith do better, but it's not a bad time filler if you can't find anything else to watch. As far as Danielle Steel's books being made into films, it's not my favourite."
4,It's always with me,"I've had my U10 for for 5 years or more and it's always with me - always! The pic quality is excellent and I have printed (at Walmart, etc.) many 4x5 and 8x10 (yes 8x10) pics and no one believes they were taken using a 1.3 MP camera. My only real complaint is the shutter lag which is significant when trying to shoot my fast-moving grandson. I wish SONY would make a similar size camera with a super short shutter lag and maybe a decent movie mode - even if it were only 2-3 MP."
1,Huh...,"Wow, I really don't understand why so many people like this series. It was cliche and predictable; I could see the ending from a mile away! The characters were weak, and held back the plot of the story (Every freakin' character has unlimited magical powers! The lead female character is such a Mary Sue that I actually thought the author was joking. Also, why is every character unbelievabley gorgeous? That was a big pet peeve of mine while reading the series). I had to force myself to finish the books. BAD BAD BAD. If you are a reader of mature adult fantasy, do not subject yourself to these horrible books (no offense). One last thought...just because the story takes place in ""hell"" and has sex in it does not mean it is an ""adult"" story. Why did so many reviewers warn of offensive content? I felt like I was reading a children's book! Man, it feels good getting this off my chest."
1,Only managed the first book,"Weak, predictable and boring.I read the first book and decided that I could not be bothered with this level of drab. I found it incoherent and just plain dull. Could not bring myself to pick up volume two."
3,Not Bad,"This trilogy was relatively good. Some of the language used by the author in dialogue and description seemed forced and out of place for the story line. Also, some of the events and/or actions of the characters seemed to not fit for me. Attempting to understand the world created by Bishop was sometimes a daunting task that required me to stop reading and think about who or what a character was. The first two books were a little hard to get into for me, but the third was wonderful and I couldn't put it down. I would buy another novel by Bishop, if only to give her a second chance."
5,4.5 stars,"I can't tell you exactly what it is about this trilogy (and The Invisible Ring, a novel that takes place in the same universe) that keeps me coming back. It might be the originality - everything about this series is new and different. It might be the characters. I tend to think that it is the universe itself that Anne Bishop has created - so intricate and detailed!The first book of the trilogy (Daughter of the Blood) was much more gruesome than the other two, so if you are squeamish, push your way past it. It will be worth it!I have only one complaint about this series: all of the likeable female characters tend to follow the stereotype found in so much fantasy today: beautiful but stubborn; proud and bitchy but with a heart of gold. Only Wilhemena doesn't fit this stereotype, and she is my favorite character for it.All in all, an amazing read. I would recommend this to anyone who likes dark fantasy."
3,Pretty good,"Ok, the series has its problems. I don't like the ""kindred"" - I find them very annoying. Don't like the secondary characters either. I hate it when we have to read through sections of the villains plotting against Jaenelle...it's juvenile and condescending, as if the author has to spell out for the readers what is going on, when everything is actually really obvious. ""Look how evil the bad guys are! They smirk!"" And everyone in the book needs to exclaim ""Mother Night"" or some such nonsense every time one of the females acts quirky or Jaenelle, who they know is supergirl, does something powerful.Now. I really like the world from the story. I love Daemon and Saetan. I am fond of Lucivar and Jaenelle. I enjoy their interactions immensely. The first one is definitely my favorite and I would actually rate it 4 stars."
2,Writing is uneven.,"I read the black jewels trilogy on the recommendation of a friend. Unfortunately I find that the writing is very uneven, and there is not much continuity. It feels somewhat like a mixture of Anne Rice and Jacqueline Carey, with none of the finesse of either.It would probably appeal to readers of fantasy/romance novels like Cristine Freehan. There is not much intricacy in the plots, the S&M; seem to be thrown in without much thought and the characters have powerful emotions but lack depth or wit.I do not recommend this book as a good fantasy novel."
5,Simply brilliant,A completely believable world that draws you in from the first chapter. A dramatic yet deeply personalized story with excellent character development. What I love most about this book is the unique world Anne Bishop has created and the opportunity to live and ponder the ethical and emotional dilemmas she so expertly presents.
2,What exactly is the plot..?!,"I absolutely loved the idea behind the book...however, the story is very shallow. When I finished the first book I realised there was nothing to look forward to in the sequel...! Yes the character of Saetan is charming and funny, but that is it. There is no plot, no intrigue, you just follow the evolution of the different characters. The heroine left me indifferent ( didn't hate or love her), she is just boring. No suspense, so predictable. I ended up skipping sentences, than paragraphs, finally whole pages!!! Not worth the trouble."
4,Great read!,"It was great to have the three books in one. No delay, right on to the next. Anne Bishop is a new author for me and I enjoyed immensely the story in places I would not have imagined. Characters were well developed, but not hard to follow. Many tortuous twists and unexpected events. Her ending left me wanting to find out more. I don't know if there a 4th but I would read it if so. She has quite an imagination and created a compelling read about strong women and their strong men. Only weakness might be the romance angle but I remained hopeful to the end."
5,"Lovers of Sci-Fi, Buy This Book!",Anne Bishop has created a realistic world in The Black Jewels trilogy. I am hooked!
5,LOVE IT LOVE IT LOVE IT,"If I could give this book 10 stars I would. I first became introduced to Anne Bishop's works through the novel ""Dreams Made Flesh"". After I read it about 12 times I finnaly bought The Black Jewels Trilogy. And I have never been dissapointed. I read it over and over and I have yet to get bored with it. It's a great book and it will hold any reader captive."
5,Ecstasy for Fantasy Lovers,"Anne Bishop is a goddess of the fantasy genre. I couldn't read these books fast enough the first time, and have found myself reading them over and over again! She covers every kind of mystical being imaginable, from shape-shifters and unicorns, to demons and sorcerers. She provides just enough detail to entice, without being verbose and overly ""romantic."" This is a fantastic read -- recommended for ANYONE!"
5,Loved it!,"I enjoyed this series start to finish. It was unique and kept my interest from the very beginning.I'm a sucker for the anti or ""broken"" hero and this series is chock full of them.I also loved how the strong, vital men in the series deal or try to deal with Witch. Anne has a brilliant way with words and used them to create a breathtaking series I hope to see much much more of."
5,Amazing series,"This trilogy is my all-time favorite of any books I have ever read. Anne Bishop paints a highly detailed picture of a marvelous world, with characters full of depth and feeling. The story is compelling, and once the book sinks its claws into you, you won't want to put it down. There are two more books outside this trilogy (The Invisible Ring and Dreams Made Flesh) and I'm still waiting for more."
5,WOW,I have never been interested in fantasy books or movies. This was my very first fantasy read and it blew me away. I am in the military on deployment and picked up Daughter of the Blood in our ship's library out of boredom and was hooked. Reading it was like eating a Krispy Kreme donut. I HAD TO HAVE MORE. I emailed a friend back home and had her look up the rest of the books and order the trilogy for me. All three were fabulous. I read Queen of Darkness a chapter a day because I didn't want the story to end any time soon it was so captivating. I love all three of these books and Anne Bishop has created a true and die hard fantasy reader for life!
5,Fun times,"(not 5 stars...I goofed! Its a decent 4 star though)This series was allot of fun. Bishop created a fairly unique world and her characters tend to be interesting.After reading some of the negative reviews I'm left wondering about how a fairly clear cut book could have confused so many!This series isn't ""hardcore"" fantasy like Martin/Erikson, but it does have emotional moments and almost enough violence to keep my interest.This series is well worth reading."
3,It's okay but its not a must read.,"I can't possible say how long I wanted to read this book after all the good reviews of it, it was like an enigma that I had to possess... So you can imagine my disappoint when I finished the book and realized it was only ehh.The first little Lotte story was nice a a good start but it was really only a forerunner..The real cream was ""Phantoms of the Mind"" I was really and pleasantly surprised with that story (especially with who Little Lotte was) I wish the whole book had been this story and I would have given it five stars and a firm recommendation. But as is such ""The Portal"" pulls the book back (not in a good way) and is so predictable it feels trite. The high cost of this book just does make up for only one good story, I couldn't rate it any higher than 3 stars."
4,Well worth reading,"""Angel of Music"" is a wonderful set of three well-written short stories. Each one focuses on Little Lotte and her relationship with the Angel of Music. In combination, these stories give a greater understanding of Leroux's book.I enjoyed the first two stories very much, but I didn't care much for ""The Portal,"" although parts of it were very interesting. I didn't like the repeated references to Erik's repulsive odor, which resembled that of rotting flesh. We know Erik's facial deformity was quite alarming, and that Leroux said Erik's hands smelled of death. I believe Leroux was speaking figuratively, referring to the fact that Erik had committed multiple murders, not that Erik literally smelled like a decaying corpse.Aside from this, however, these short stories are very innovative, interesting and well worth reading."
4,re; the resting place',I loved 'the resting place' but didnot enjoy the terror as it was a young Jack nicholson and I lost nterest in it . I may try to view it again at a later date.
3,Resting Place,"This is a time piece movie dealing with segregated laws of the South and a failing hero family fighting for right to bury their War Hero son. I was disappointed that Morgan Freedman part was very small, however there were turns and twist to the story that leads to great conversation with American history. It was a good movie."
2,not for a stinky dog,although this does lather fairly well fragrence does not stay on dog I thought rosewater would emit a better after smell.
3,A Mother's Mental Illness,"This is the 1983 movie starring Dina Merrill and Sylvia Sidney. It is a slice-of-life story about a mentally ill mother and her three young children. It is not a horror story about a surgeon, even though that description appears on the back of the DVD case. The story, I think, could be improved but the actors give good performances."
1,disappointed,"The description of the dvd was incorrect, and it was boring. I would not recommend the story matter. I received it promptly and in good shape."
2,Looked better online,"I would not have bought this bag if I had seen it in person.It will suffice, but it's too floppy looking to be rocking on the streets with style."
5,Versatile bag!,"I have the black mandara hugger mugger mat (which is wider and longer than a standard mat). Not only does it fit in the bag, but I can also fit my block and towel with room to spare--VERY ROOMY :) This was exactly what I was looking for."
5,Love this bag!,"This yoga bag is not only super cute, but it holds my mat, Yogitoes, my phone, my wallet and I'm sure it would even hold a change of clothes and possibly a block. It's really roomy but it's not bulky and hard to carry around. I use it every time I go to yoga (which is 1-3 times a week) and I love it!"
3,The best book in a lousy series,"This series was really not very good at all, but this book did stand out as a better book than it's predecesers. The characterizations are a bit better, though not by much, and it seemed to have a touch more Star Wars feel than the others, which hardly seemed to be Star Wars books they were so far from what the characters are supposed to be. The plot was a little more believable too, though some parts of it were still very silly. It had a higher sense of drama too, in that it actually HAD a sense of drama. This would be a good series for kids twelve and under, though older fans probably won't like them."
5,It really is MAGIC!,"I use the conditioner and detangler on Golden Retrievers and it works beautifully. They both have have thick full coats but my boy has especially thick long fur on his tail, pants, front feathers and bib. The conditioner lets me comb them out after a bath with no struggle or tangles and the detangler is amazing on matts and tangles. It also helps to prevent matts and stops ""snow balls"" from forming on all that soft fur and fuzz. I use it on my hair in the summer to control ""frizz"" - it just ""works""."
4,Agravating Details,"I thought the book was well written and funny at the beginning, but at the end it became a little agravating. His humor used at the end came at the wrong times and kind of made your stomach turn. The book began as a light and funny comedy, but turned a touch revolting. The ending and beginning made up for it though so I gave it a 4 out of 5."
2,not funny.,"I'm not really a kid, I just didn't feel like signing in.I expected a lot from this book and was completely disappointed. It's not funny! You know that friend of yours who drags the joke out way too long? that friend is this book. I laughed a couple of times in the beginning and then I realized that that was about as good as it was going to get. And past the unfunny jokes, I felt like I was getting beaten over the head with the war-is-crazy, beaurocracy-is-endless message. He could have accomplished the same thing in 300 less pages. I can't believe I actually wasted my time reading this."
1,"Really, Really Disappointing","This novel is widely regarded as a comic masterpiece. The best I can say about it is that occasionally - and I mean once every hundred pages or so - it makes an acute observation about human nature, war, or bureaucracy. The satire in the rest of the book is too broad to be either funny or wise, and there is nothing here to make us care about the characters or what happens to them."
1,"A campy, time worn relic that has not aged well","I first read Catch-22 when I was in high school in the '70s. I hated it. But throughout my life I kept bumping into people who worshiped this book as if it was a great missing chapter from the Bible. So, I recently decided to give it another try. I'm older and wiser now, I thought, so maybe I might finally ""get"" whatever it was I missed in the first reading decades ago. I should have stuck with my initial teenage impressions. This book bored me in '70s and it still bored me in the '90s. Great charactor names like... Major Major Major Major! Wow, that's really funny! Whew! This book is a stinker. I don't need Joseph Heller to tell me that war is hell. Why do you?"
2,Yuck.,"Sorry. I didn't like it. I tried to read it for school and found it incredibly hard to get through. The writing is bad and the jokes are not that funny. There are some good spots, but he rambles WAY too much. I have given up on finishing it. I am completely against war, as well, but this book is not brilliant or otherwise. If you want humor, I suggest Douglas Adams."
4,"A very interesting, unusual story","Catch-22 is a very interesting story about a bombardier named Yossarian stationed in Italy during WWII...The whole world seems crazy in this novel and there are plenty of crazy characters that inhabit it. It might sound weird to say, but there really isn't a plot in this story. It's just a bunch of funny and sometimes sad events told in a nonchronological order. This would make the story confusing, but since there isn't really a plot it doesn't really matter. Reading this novel one can tell there are many layers and meanings, but it's not neccessary to delve too deeply into these meanings as the book can be read just for it's hilarity. I found some parts to be laugh-out-loud funny. This book is somewhat hard to describe and one can really only appreciate it if they read it. It's worth reading and I personally got through it very quickly..."
2,"War is tedious, and so is this book.","So, here's the thing. I know this is supposed to be one of the seminal works of American literature, and blazingly funny to boot. And while I have no doubt Catch-22 will maintain its place in the canon regardless of anything I write, I found the whole thing quite tedious.Perhaps that was Heller's point: that war is tedious, that war doesn't make sense, that the only way for a soldier to survive a war with sanity intact is to develop a sense of the absurd and act on it. But after 144 pages, I knew I didn't care enough about Yossarian or any other character to follow the absurdity for another 300 pages.Thus, a two-star rating simply because I didn't care."
4,I think someone should say it...,Do you think the people who are criticizing this book for being unnecessarily anti-military realize Heller was in the military? Maybe he knows a thing or two about a war.
4,The wheels of the story went round and round...,"I was really introduced to this book by reading John van der Ruit's ""Spud"" novel. It was very funny in places and, as one who served in the Air Force, much of the scenarios showed that the author understood the context well! I will admit that I started to lose interest after a while as the author tends to spend whole chapters on individuals; some of them grabbed me and others were rather boring. On the whole, an entertaining read that explores human fickleness, the rigidness of societal structures and the absurdity of war."
2,Funny but dull,"I wasn't too excited to start this book. I had to read it with my class at school and, well, we usually don't read very good novels. This one was...okay. The entire novel was a satire-making fun of war. There were a few parts that really made me laugh, but sometimes the book seemed to drag on and on with the corny jokes! And sometimes it didn't make sense just because the author didn't feel like making sense in order to prove a point. I know that's a certain style, but it irks me.I liked how the characters were well defined, if annoying at times. I know, I know-they're supposed to be this way. I'm just not used to reading any book like this one.I'm giving ""Catch 22″ 2/5 stars: 1 star for the fact that it made me laugh [sometimes], and the other for the combination of it being a classic book [then it must be good enough for people to read XD] and having great characters."
4,still a good read,"I hadn't read Catch-22 since I was a young guy in the Air Force. But after re-reading it now, I am suprised at how well it has held up. I do think you will probably enjoy it more if you are or have been in the military, as much of the humor and satire in the book deals with the military beaucracy, and if you haven't experienced it, you may not ""get"" some of what Heller is presenting."
5,A great war novel,"This is an excellent book chronicling the experiences of an American bombardier in WWII with objections to sacrificing his seemingly infinitesimal self in order to win a war. The prose is stirring and although the vocabulary can be difficult at times, it forces your mind to create a vivid picture of the scenes. The hilarious characters make you laugh out loud. My favorite scenes were with the two CID men with Major Major and the scene where Yossarion pretends to be a man who died in the hospital for the family of the victim. It was seemingly almost entirely a comedic piece until the last thirty pages, in which the reader arrives at the startling revelation that nearly all of the enormous cast of characters has died. Though it took me a long time to finish, I would gladly read it again."
4,It helps to grow up...,"Like most who have read this novel at different times in their lives, the first readings are not nearly so fulfilling as the reading once the silly arrogance of college life has long been left behind. This book means more to those of us who have matured because the institutional insanity so cleverly articulated by Heller in this novel is more pervasive today... and not just in the the military. I think it takes decades of living before some of the truths in novels such as this meaningfully reveal themselves. When I was required to read this in an American Lit. class in college, I pretended to understand it, because I was full of myself. Now, looking back, I realize I didn't understand it then at all."
4,Something everyone should read!,"Catch-22 is the story of a bombardier named Yossarian, who is a frenzied officer in the air force who believes that thousands of people he hasn't even met are trying to kill him, which is somewhat true, but they are really trying to kill everyone. His superiors have no compassion, and like other people of great power believe that Yossarian and other officers are there to serve them. Everyone thinks Yossarian is crazy but the only thing he is crazy about is staying alive. Whatever he does he cannot seem to escape the tragedy of catch-22. This gut-wrenching novel, which attacks the cracks in the dehumanizing military service of WW II, reminds us once again of all that we have taken for granted in our world and should not. This long novel took me awhile to finish but it was worth the effort. Every teenager should read this and find the deep meaning of catch-22."
4,More Fun Then You Would Think,I found myself laughing more then I thought I would with this book. Buy it becuase you want to see humor in a crazy situation.
5,Fantastic.,"If you like a good story, then do yourself a favour and read Catch-22. If there is one book everyone should read atleast once in their life, it's this one."
4,Horrifically Funny!,"An excellent book that is rich with very interesting, yet simply real characters! This book will keep you laughing but once you realise what you're laughing at, it makes you stop and think!I can't give it the full 5 stars though because I found that it took some time to warm to this book and this style of writing.If you haven't read it yet I strongly urge you do!"
5,"Hilarious, the perfecta mix of cynicism and black humor",It is wonderful when all the bits and pieces finally come together at the end.
2,Overestimated,"I found Hellers work abysmal. I read it (and bought it) because I'd never read it, and heard from others that it's worth it. They lied. Heller tries to write in much the same manner as Jim Carrey or his progener Jerry Lewis try to act. No thought is given to the conclusion; all that matters to any of them is the method of destruction to the next punch-line. Bah, never have I wasted more time trying to be ""educated""..."
2,Full of highlighing and notes on the pages,"This arrived in good time, and the outside of the book looked great, but inside it is full of highlighting in differnt colors and notes written in pen. It is VERY annoying to read, and I feel mislead about the quality of this copy."
4,Humour and Craziness makes the Catch-22,"Catch-22 is an exhilarating comedy that pokes fun to the ultra-seriousness of our government and it's ridiculous rules. It gives the reader a chance to laugh at the very exaggerated truth that many soilders have gone threw. Heller brillantly uses the characters and their problems in life, the surroundings to tell the story. It's comedy mixed with the craziness is a delight for those who have a sense of humour."
2,Gets Old Real Fast,"Repetitive, boring, long, and the constant self-contradicting statements got old real fast. I get that it's a criticism of war and bureaucracy and all that but it's a really poor one in my opinion. 2 stars for being mildly amusing and some cleverness here and there."
3,Had to work hard to read half of it,I got through about half of this book and even that was a challenge. It was funny at times however but not enough for me to finish the book. Any book that uses the Lord's name in vain this much is not for me. But I've never been in the military either.
2,"Interesting in a bad way, you might say.","I am using my mom's account and so this review is by me, not my mom.I read this book for a book project. I must say that I was misled by the short description of the book that said that it was ""full of witty humor"". This book makes very little sense. The order of events is screwed up to the point that I was strongly tempted to rip out the pages and put them in some kind of a rational order. The ""humor"" in the book is really not that funny to be honest. The rare moments of true comedy were so scarce as to not be able to justify this books existence. Any morals or ""big ideas"" that you were supposed to get out of reading this book are lost in the nonsensical ramblings that I guess were supposed to be the plot. I gave this book a star rating because I was required to. Actually, I have mixed feelings about its contents and can't decide on a good rating. I guess the absurdity of the book could be a comparison to the absurdity of war."
5,Tu Sei Pazzo,"Joseph Heller's Catch-22, is an unequivocal satire on postmodern American life, with messages of dissident revolt that are well suited to the decade in which they appear. Heller is almost systematic in the issues he touches: the frustration of the individual up against powerful and faceless bureaucracies; the anticommunist purges of the Cold War and its smug hypocrisies; and strong antiwar issues that dominate postmodern America. In Heller's works, escaping these traps and inconsistencies of government is essential in the pursuit of moral and self-preservation. After all, ""The enemy,"" as Yossarian puts it, ""is anybody who's going to get you killed, no matter which side he's on."""
5,I was absolutely floored...,"One of the most phenomenal books in the English language, it is a hilarious, perverse and unsettling trip into war. This is not an easy read, and should be read with an open mind. With great dialogue, a fun plot, this has to be my favorite book!"
5,it's all about catch-22,"This is hands-down one of the best books ever written. As absurd as it seems while you're reading it, you know it's only funny because it's all truth about human nature, and everyone I've met who's read it has affirmed my opinion."
3,It started off well enough,"Catch-22 started off incredibly witty and profound and well, good. But after the first few chapters the humor gets old and repetitive, and towards the end of the book the humor was either no longer there or I no longer found it even mildly amusing. I had to force myself to finish the book and it took me weeks. The book also wasn't very action-packed. Don't get me wrong, I liked the book, and I thought it was somewhat insightful into war and human nature, but after awhile I found it to be tiresome and worn out. I'd recommend it for the first few chapters alone, and some of the characters are hilarious, but expect redundancy."
3,catch-22,"with little time to read the book, the cd's let me listen in the car in between class and not keep me locked in once place reading."
3,War is Hell,"This book is difficult to review because it swings between funny anecdotes and horrific descriptions of war. There is also much extraneous material to slog through which makes it a long read. The tone is reminiscent of the television series M*A*S*H, or since Catch-22 came first, maybe it is the other way around. In any case it is an interesting book but a classic it is not. Stick with Tolstoy, Hemingway or Fitzgerald."
2,And this is a classic why?,"I decided to fill in the gaps of my knowledge of classic American literature--I didn't grow up in the US, so I hadn't read most of the books US students would have read in school. I was scratching my head over this book after several chapters and gave up on it after several more. It seemed to me that at the time it was written, the book may have been a powerful anti-war statement and perhaps an example of a writing style that hadn't been seen before, but I found it very dated, lacking context, and little more than a sequence of caricature vignettes and slapstick devices. Maybe I failed to appreciate it because I'm not American, though I have a decent knowledge of US history and I've been living in the US for more than a decade."
2,400+ pages of the same thing,"'Catch-22' is a pretty famous book, so you might think you need to read it to be ""well read"". Don't. If you read more than 20 pages you will just be wasting your time. You get the idea by the time you finish the first couple chapters, and after that it's just the same stupidity over and over again. Save yourself some time and trouble and just skip the entire thing."
2,original but annoying,"I had to read this book for school and I didn't find it an exactly fun venture- I disliked it from the beginning and had to force myself to finish it. The last about 70 pages or so are probably the best part the book, but the rest is hardly worth reading. I didn't like the humor or his writing style. I will say that I have never read a book like it. But if you are into reading this type of thing, then it would probably be a good for choice for a read. Otherwise I'd say, with this book, just don't bother."
5,Good book in good shape,The book was in better shape than expected. Decently fast shipping. It was obscenely cheap.
3,"An often entertaining, often annoying, mess","What a disappointing book! I had been told by so many people how funny and amazing this book was, only to find it just okay. Many passages were chores to get through, and even Yossarian was annoying throughout the book. I'll give it this much--it is very clever, perhaps it was revolutionary in its day, and the last sixty pages almost make up for all the weaknesses throughout the book. I guess most people SHOULD read it, but it's a lot like doing homework."
4,Long But A Good Laugh,"Catch-22 has to be one of the funniest books that I have ever read. While I was reading it, I would burst out and start laughing because this book was so humorous. Unfortunately, I dislike reading long books. But this is one long book that I am happy I finished. It was fun to see how stupid the military can be and how shallow people are. Yossarian was a true anti-hero who made the novel enjoyable...as well as Orr and Nately's whore...they really drove me nuts. Well, I recommend this book to anyone who has a month to waste and wants a good laugh."
5,"DON'T WAIT, READ IT NOW!!!","It is one of the greatest book I ever read. It teaches everything one needs to know about life, mainly catch-22. If you haven't read it yet, you don't know what you are missing. I'm sure this book will give you a whole new reading experience. Hillarious, Funny, yet Disturbing."
3,"A point well made, but overly illustrated","Heller does an admirable job of removing the mystery from the military in his novel. However, he badgers his reader to the point where any knowledge or truth that has been gleaned from the novel is lost. A book about nonsense and insanity is fine, but when the reader is forced to see it through the same kaleidoscope as the characters, some of the impact is lost. One has a hard time relating to, or feeling sympathy for, the characters since we never know what they'll do next. Does Heller really mean to say that people were making money at the expense of their friend's llives? If so, the ridiculous personage of Milo is the wrong way to achieve this end. This character's actions are so ludicrous, that the reader is forced to write off the incidents completely. This is just a symptom of Heller's disease, which causes him to alienate his reader through an overdose of sarcasm and ridiculousness."
4,A comedy with insight,"Catch-22 is, in my humble opinion, one of the greatest post-modern books of all time. The book is halarious, and makes fun of all sorts of politics and religion. But in the end, ""Snowdens seceret"" reveals great spiritual truth."
3,Is there a catch to Catch-22.,Catch-22 is a story about a man named Yossarian who is a bombardierfor America during WWII the story is a mix between in-depth story telling and insanity.This book is not intended for the light reader.The book does have it's light flaws like many books do but one of it's most major flaws is it's order of story telling which can only be compared to a Quintin Terentino movie. Which is to say the least mixed up. But the comedy the story offers you over shadows it's flaws. example: Yossarian cant understand why people he has never met want to kill him (trying shoot him down while he's bombing them). This is a good book but if your looking for a quick read this is not the book for you.
2,"The catch is, it's not that funny.","Based on the word of mouth and critical praise, I picked this up expecting to be overwhelmed, but was instead merely whelmed. The story was mildly amusing, but seemed terribly dated. It just didn't have the edge I was expecting. The joke names were simply foolish: Monty Python did much better in The Life of Brian. I mean, come on, Colonel Korn? Major Major Major Major? And that one officer (I forget his rank) Scheisskopf? (Snicker, snicker, I know what that means in German!) Perphaps it was a groundbreaker when it was released, and maybe its irrelevance today is due in part to its imitation by newer writers who have been able to give it a sharper-honed edge. I dunno, maybe I should take the guy from Toronto's advice and keep reading it until I like it . . ."
5,Yossarian lives!,"Heller's style is very similar to Kurt Vonnegut's, and being a huge Vonnegut fan, I really enjoyed Catch-22. The structure of the story was very interesting too - each chapter was about a different character, such that instead of getting a whole story, you get glimpses of the story from many different perspectives, which I think helped develop the characters very well.The Everyman's Library edition is a very good looking book. And not as bulky as usual hard covers."
1,Am I the only one that hated this book?,"Pathetic.I forced myself to finish this book because it was heralded as ""one of the greatest novels of the century."" I found it an amazing chore to trudge through page after page of absurd, repetitive babble, replete with needless descriptions of depraved immorality.If the point is that government/military institutions are insanely inefficient and bureaucratic, ok. I got that in the first 100 pages. Were the next 400 pages simply meant to illustrate that point -- making me ""experience"" the absurdity?. I really can't believe I read the whole thing.In all sincerity, I can not recommend this book."
1,A Word To The Wise...,"I know... it's just me (it's always just me), but please take heed, and special notice that ""Catch 22"" is written in the form of a diary. Just as ""Dracula"" is. It seems most people don't mind the diary style, but I can't get over it. It's as though I'm reading someone else's letters, and it doesn't engage me at all. Take that for what it's worth. I can't get through ""Dracula"" either and that's just as highly praised, if not more so than ""Catch 22"".This is a public service announcement from a reader who cares. Enjoy whatever it is you wish... as long as you're reading!"
1,Maybe after page 100.....,"I always wanted to read Catch 22 because it was a famous book (and of course the term was used in a Metallica song). I began reading it three times but after 50 pages or so, I always lost interest. I never could discover a story and the many dialogues and events are strange, to say the least. Someone once told me it is a great book after page 100 but I never got that far. So I can only say: don't even try reading Catch 22', read '1984' by George Orwell and listen to Metallica."
3,Catch-22,"I bought this to re-read for my Book Club. I had read it many years ago and had loved it. Now, a couple of decades +, it just didn't hit the same level. I guess it's true that life changes your perspective on the past."
5,Life-changing,"Joseph Heller's greatest book changed my life the first time I read it in 1999, which, alas, was the year of the author's death. I have been influenced so much by it that I often use the word ""Catch-22"" in conversations! Although many say that the book's dark humor and existential discussions of the absurdity and cruelty of war have been surpassed by other subsequent works by new writers, I still believe all the others merely stand on Joseph Heller's achievements. Anyone who wants to see what the fuss is about should read Catch-22 to see it for themselves."
2,Read Vonnegut instead,"I read this book because I saw it was recommended by Kurt Vonnegut and then again by Matt Groening in a Life in Hell comic strip, so I thought it must be pretty good. It starts out great, but Heller's style is so repetitive it becomes pretty boring to slog through it. It would have been much better if it had been edited down by about half. My advice--read anything by Vonnegut instead...even his worst efforts are better than this thing."
5,READ THIS BOOK!,"This book is truly funny funny funny!!! I was supposed to read it for a report for school, and I almost shrieked at the length of it. The escapades of Capt. Yossarian and the 256th squadron were hilarious, illogical, and downright strange, but I couldn't put the book down. I highly recommend this story to everyone, and please don't be discouraged by its size."
4,Even a foreigner will like it!,"Actually, i read a translation edition of this book. Cultur differences do make some trouble in my reading. But i still like this dark satire."
