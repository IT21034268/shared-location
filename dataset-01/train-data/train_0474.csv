2,Visually appealing but nonsensical,"First of all, I write this as a fan of David Lynch movies. Please disregard all those ""top reviewers"" who have nothing better to do than write reviews on this web site. And disregard all those people who say you have to be smart or open-minded to understand this movie. Bottom line: this movie makes absolutely no sense. Even after the supposed ""explanation"" for this movie - sorry Mr Lynch - it still makes no sense, and it is just an exercise in frustration to try and figure it out. Anyone who says they understand this movie just wants to be part of the crowd.This movie has great cinematography and some excellent dramatic scenes; one of my favorites being the scene in the theatre toward the end. The acting is superb. Sounds like a formula for a great movie but unfortunately its a convoluted mess with an even more convoluted ending.Unless you are a big fan of David Lynch avoid this film. For the average movie-goer it just won't be worth it."
2,Don't buy this one,This DVD does not have scene selection--the first DVD I have ever seen that does not have this feature. Other copies of the same movie do have that option. Read the fine print on product description before you buy. ...
4,DO NOT buy the DVD version,"The movie was interesting, frustrating, captivating, puzzling and bizarre. The other reviews can shed more light on the movie. I wanted to comment on the DVD itself. This must be the first DVD released by the manufacturer! The DVD lacks any interesting extra features and also lacks the most basic of DVD features. The worst part about the DVD is the lack of chapters. If you want to return to a part in the movie, you must fast forward through the entire movie! Hopefully, the will re-release this DVD with at least the basic DVD features."
3,Censors ! Censors !,"I always thought the bleeping out of the pubic hair was only for the Cable Channels ( family fare ). If a movie is rated R, it is sold only to 18 plus people, I expect to have a guarantee of a complete uncensored director's cut film. Unfortenately it does not happen again in this movie and the only frontal nudity scene is blotched out completely. I haven't found on the web a site that could warned us about this cheating on the customers."
2,"No story line, very unorganized and sloppy","Okay! I'll admit I liked, no I loved the girl-girl scenes between Laura Harring and Naomi Watts (especially the bedroom one). Besides those, there was no other good part to the movie. I think the ending [stunk] majorly, not summing up the story in any way, and the whole name change thing was confusing. Tere are some people that liked this movie, and who am I to argue, I can understand liking it for its mystery, it just wasn't my type of movie."
1,Seven faces of Eve?,"...P>My problem with this movie is that the purpose of this medium is to relay amessage. Whether the Writer/Director intends this message to be purelyentertainment based (Bruckheimer), or expects the viewers to work a littleharder (i.e. Memento). Lynch seems to have decided that his cult followingis enough and there is no need to tell anyone what this message is. Thefact that he tries to bail himself out by tossing in some eye-candy and agirl on girl sex scene is apalling. We the viewers are expected to bemesmorized into watching this movie because it has pretty people in it, allthe while praying that the answer to the puzzle that Lynch lays out in thefirst half of the movie will be answered in an acceptable manner.This movie provides a ringing endorsement, as well as a reminder, to avoidfuture Lynch projects."
5,a haunting film,"I was deeply moved by this movie. The story of a woman trying to make it in Hollywood, it is one of the greater character studies I have ever seen. When the final act unfolded, and I realized what I had been privy to, I started squirming in my seat, almost embarrassed and apologetic that I had been such an intruder into this woman's head.Naomi Watts was truly amazing. If the Oscars actually rewarded talent, she would have walked away with one."
1,"I'd Rather Watch a ""Barney"" Video 500 Times...","I tried to like this movie. I really did. But for the life of me, I can't see how it's received so much praise. The story makes great efforts to throw in a twist at the end ... but the preparation leading up to it makes such little sense that you know it's coming so it's no surprise. There is little or no music to add suspense/emotion/etc. to the plot, and there are about a billion common-sense questions that go unanswered. This was one of the worst movies I've ever watched."
1,This [was bad]!!!,"If you ever want to feel like you're on a bad acid trip just rent this movie. The beginning seemed to have potential but totally fell apart by the end. Lynch couldn't pull off a somewhat satisfactory ending after two and half hours. Hang it up until you can put out something good ol'Davey, please!"
2,Waste of Time,I stayed up very late watching this movie becuase I was waiting to see how it would come together at the end. I'm still waiting. It started out with intruiging plot lines then disintegrated into artistic babble. I wasn't aware of this director's history prior to buying the DVD. Had I been I would have passed. If you are the type that can find deep meaning in a painting consisting of splatters and splashes then by all means buy this movie. If you're looking for something with a comprehensible plot check elsewhere.
3,Mullholland Drive,"I only understood this movie in a very general way. I decided to just relax and enjoy it without analyzing or trying to grasp the plot, which seemed to be ever-changing as it twisted and turned along this truly surreal nightmare. When Betty and the mystery woman somehow became Camilla and Diane...I tried to just enjoy the ride without delving too deeply into the plot, if there was one. What was dream-like fantasy and what was real was so blurred most of the time that I came to think that viewers were not really meant to understand it. I enjoyed the acting and the whole film was visually moving and beautiful in its on way. I liked the cameo roles by Chad Everett and Billy Ray Cyrus (whatta HUNK!) The movie stays with you because you keep telling yourself that if you think about it long enough, you will make some sense of the whole thing. That has not really happened yet for me, but I am still trying..."
1,Mulholland Drive,What was it all about - sorry but did not understand one word of it. Twin Peaks - Yes David Lynch - YesMulholland Drive not even a movie to do ironing to.
1,DO NOT BUY!!!,I totally agree with the 1 star review....I bought the DVD as soon as it showed up and found it very SAD....No extras..... NO chapters......
1,DVD has no *scene selections* feature,"it plays like a straight VHS video, which is unforgivable (worse, it takes longer to get to a middle scene than a videotape). Had I known, I wouldn't have bought it."
2,Great Movie BUT.. No Scene Selection for this DVD!!!,"I'm a big fan of David Lynch and I was really looking forward to getting this film on DVD. Upon release, I picked up the disc and only after throwing it in my player did I realize there is no scene selection menu! What's up with that? No jumping to a scene for this disc! Maybe its in the works for the ""limited collector's special hard to find"" version. Great movie, but being spoiled by just about every other DVD that have more features than they deserve, the very least Universal should have done was provide scene selection. It is one of the best features of DVD. Oddly enough, letterbox, sub-titles & languages (Spanish and French) are in tact."
1,Overpriced and Underproduced,"Easily Lynch's low point. An aimless, rambling waste of time and technology. Surely there are more worthwhile uses of electricity than to power DVD players to run this lousy movie.But what is especially insulting is the very high price on this DVD. There isn't a single extra feature of any consequence, which is evidently Lynch's decision. Fine and good. But this single DVD costs more than most double DVD sets. Why? Is it printed on extra-high quality DVD stock? No, looks about the same to me. Are the liner notes really special? No. Is there anything about this release to justify the jacked up price?No. Not a single thing.Save your money. Wait for Eraserhead to come out on DVD, and see what Lynch is capable of when he is working at his best. Avoid this overheated overhyped load of nonsense."
1,movie=awesome dvd= rip off,"I love mulholland Drive. i absolutly adore the movie, but this dvd release is the only material thing i have ever seen that actually made me angry. Not only is there no bonus features. but theres no scene selection. What is the point of having a dvd if there is no bonus material or at least a scene selection. Now the one thing that makes me want to grab every copy of this dvd and destroy it is that its edited. THE MOVIE IS CENSORED. They blur out the genitals of one of the lead actresses in one scene. there is no point in purchasing this dvd. Wait until theres a unrated ""special edition"" or whatever if there even is going to be one."
1,"Love Lynch, hate this DVD","I really loved Mulholland Drive when I saw it in the theater, so much so, that I bought the DVD on the first day it was available.What a mistake.As others have complained, this DVD does not have any scene selection. It is made up of one chapter, one 2 hour and 20 minute chapter!Others have speculated on why the DVD was manufactured in this way-did David Lynch request that it be distributed without interruption? Who knows, and more to the point, who cares. From one consumer to another, I recommend that you pass on this DVD, especially at $32 retail."
2,goes downhill,"This was a great movie until, unfortunately, David Lynch has no idea how to end it. The last part is truly pathetic. But the acting of the two leads, both women, is wonderful. Worth a view; what a pity the director didn't have a better writer than himself."
1,WAS THIS MOVIE THE RESULT OF SOME UNDIGESTED MEAT,"To paraphase scrooge from dickens was this movie the result of some undigested italian meat that the director eat or as butch and the sundance kid would say ""who are these guys"".In my own words ""what does that first coffee shop scene have to do with anything.Aside from naomi watts the movie, like the emperor ,has no clothes."
2,Vocabulary is too weird/advanced,"I'm reading this to my 2 1/2 year old girl, and since I have to read a book about five times in a row, I start to get cranky if I find blatant problems with the text or illustrations...Well, how does one explain tin, map, tax, bog? I'm not sure why they didn't take easier words, such as cut/cat, dog/dig, etc. Instead we have oddities like six/sax and ten/tin. There is a strong presumption that not only does the child know her numbers, but she also knows how to spell them???Also, an oddly sadistic streak to this book. A pig gets uprooted from his home into a pan, a squirrel loses his food, a kid has problems with his book, and worst of all, a mother bear holding her cub has the cub turned into a corn cob. That could be rather distressing to a child with a little imagination and ability to project.This could have been a much better book had more thought gone into the word selection. Humor can be found in more than just ""pranks."""
3,Must have,Anyone with an interest in Carl Jung should find this DVD fascinating. The impressions of people who actually knew him and worked with him is a special treat.
4,Picture of the professional man made personal....,"Matter of Heart is an in depth look at Carl Jung through the eyes of others. There are two lengthy and separate interviews with Jung that make it very special, however. Matter of Heart is an academic CD presentation, filmed in black and white and color during the 1950's and 1960's. It gives a good snapshot of the man."
4,Matter of Heart,"This video surprised me. It starts off slowly and unimpressively, but it builds. It mainly follows Jung's life but also does a fair job of explaining many of his major ideas. The video quality is not good. Most of the video is period, taken from either interviews of Jung himself or of his students. I found it both interesting and informative. A good introduction to Jung and his life and ideas."
1,Where does this guy live!?,"As a current American ex-patriot in southern France, I have no idea where Peter Mayle thinks he's living. All he describes are peasants on bicyclettes - I don't think so! Mayle writes a fantasy of what people *think* living in southern France is like. It's not real. If you're looking for a fun, realistic reflection of the joys and hardships of living abroad, read Tim Parks or Frances Meyer. Peter Mayle is a snob and he patronizes his neighbors. I really wanted to like his books, but I don't."
3,Light Read,"Having read Under the Tuscan Sun which was a much better read than the movie, I stumbled upon this book at the local thrift store. Frances Mayes writes very similarly to Peter Mayle who wrote his book years before she did hers. As Mayle did if you have ample money to restore a house in aN interesting setting and in another country-keep a journal about the experience and write a book with characters. Both books are good reads, but this one can be done in one day."
5,A Vacation for the Mind: A Year in Provence,"This book has something for everyone. The anecdotes are charming, funny, and full of deliciously descriptive sentences. I read some passages aloud to whoever will listen. This is the 2nd book I've read by Peter Mayle. I also read ""A Good Year"" and am currently reading, ""Toujours Provence!"" Mayle's books are refreshing and delightful to read."
5,Enchanting.,"Peter Mayle has managed to make me feel as if I spent ""A Year In Provence"". I recommend this this to anyone who would like to escape for the day to a new place. You will taste the wine, smell the bread, and join in as Peter and his wife learn the ways of Provence."
3,Provence here I come !,"Hilarious recounting of the author's attempts to settle in the south of France. Plenty of colourful anecdotes, insights into the peculiarities of the French locals and anglo saxon attempts to cope with them. Also a remarkable account of the things that attract people to France in the first place, food, wine, and a huge joie de vivre.... It's a book that has spawned a miriad of imitators both in the literary world as well as a literary sense."
2,A Bothersome Weakness,"Mayle's description of the Provencal food and culture was fine, no problem there; but I was regularly distracted by his invocation of numerous English ""friends"" who just happened to ""invite themselves"" to his slice of Gallic heaven. Mayle is proud of his self-restraint and tolerance of guests who are supposedly friends, but rarely bothers to explain why he left a trail for them to follow. My guess is that they're used by Mayle as literary foils, as contrast against the French rustics. I don't recall him saying he didn't leave word as to his whereabouts; why didn't he simply excuse himself from hosting duties by pleading temporary absence? Mayle's experiences weren't rich enough to carry a book, so he relied on the foibles of others for copy? Otherwise a pleasant, if eventually predictable, read."
1,"If you get the chance to read this book, DON'T","Rarely has a book received so much critical acclaim for so little reason. One year in the life of a boring snob, even worse, a food snob. Peter Mayle does nothing to help us understand another culture. No truffles of wisdom here.Read this book if you want twelve chapters of the eating habits of an elitist snob. My advice - if you get the chance to read this book, don't."
2,Rich Snob Ruins Good Writing Career with This Garbage,"I like Peter Mayle's fiction a lot, but when you meet him as a character, you wonder why a fictional snob is fun but a real one isn't. Maybe because his characters actually have jobs and lives, while he's a dilletante who spends his time eating and complaining. Some people dream of doing what he did. I don't. He runs away from the real world, moves into a house most of us could never afford, and glorifies the life of the idle semi-rich.Despite a good writing style, Mayle fails to make this book accessible to those of us whose lives are not about leisure time and food. I wonder if this man ever for one second realizes just how condescending he is, or how out of touch his snotty way of life has gotten. I would much rather he stayed at home in London and got a real job.Skip this book unless you really care about how well the French seemingly eat. And truthfully, I don't really believe half of what he wrote about the peasantry."
2,"Not badly written, just boring.","The fault may be mine. I think travel diary is just not my genre. I appreciate stories driven by plot and rich characters (the only rich character in this story is the food!). I kept asking myself where the book was heading, but basically it was just heading to the next dining experience, home improvement project, or inconsiderate guest. If I hadn't been reading the book for a book club meeting, I never would have bothered finishing it.That being said, the writing does flow nicely. The book is well written, and some of the experiences are fun to read. If you enjoy travelogues, you will probably enjoy this book.Warning: If this book were a movie, it would be rated PG-13 due to one strong expletive that blindsides you as you are reading along."
1,a year in provence,"This book was a great idea (and had great cover art), but it killed the dream of provence in me and left me cold and bloodless... I do not recommend it as an enjoyable read."
2,A Quaint Provence for the Well-Off,"It should have been called ""A Year of House Refurbishment in Provence."" This frivolity could have done with less about tradesmen--because let's face it, we get no new insights on them here--and more about past culture and history of the region. I guess this book is ""of an era,"" written by a man whose life had been in advertising, and so with an eye on popular appeal. As such, it was not gritty enough for me; it was too comfortable and quirky, reminding me of a BBC rural sitcom. Mayle portrays himself as a homey bumpkin, sensitive to the butchery of animals, but on the other hand, he'll let nothing stand in the way of his stomach, and will as enthusiastically devour veal--ignoring the implications of torturing the children of other animals--as ask which wine goes best with calves liver. Sorry, Peter, it was all just a little too quaint and not reflective enough for my taste."
1,Incredibly overrated,"The appeal of this book is in the fact that Mayle has created a Shangri-La for his readers. But at what price? He has fabricated a world that does not exist, just as Disney created a home spun fantasy on Main Street USA. This Provence did not and does not exist. I don't argue the value of fantasy, but to sell it to the masses as an accurate representation of southern France does everyone an incredible disservice. This book is a fiction. Read it, love it, recommend it - I don't care. But don't believe a word of it."
2,Pretty Weak,"The first of Peter Mayle's ""Provence"" books has some fun spots, but it's rather lame overall. ""French Lessons"" (the next in the series, I believe) is much better."
4,"Oooh, la la!","overall, i really enjoyed the imagery the author created. I can truly picture the characters in their home surrounded by demolition debris, unreliable tradesman, sunlight, foie gras, and wine. I found myself skipping over some parts that ground to a halt while over-explaining the intricacies of a hand gesture. But, that wasn't typical. I enjoyed it and was worth the purchase."
5,Read it and see for yourself!,"A French national, 4th generation ""provenale"" (from Provence), I couldn't help being both surprised and annoyed by the controversy around Peter Mayle's book. I loved his work and so did my whole family, still living in Provence. We found it refreshing to see our little world seen through a British eye, and got a real kick out of all the anecdotes. My (American) husband along with his parents read the book as well before discovering Provence and my family for the first time and enjoyed it tremendously.My advice to you, potential reader: do not pay attention to negative comments about this book. Read it and make your OWN opinion. You may love it or not.And if you end up touring in Provence, you're in for an unforgettable experience, especially if you avoid Summer months (Anyway the light in September is THE best), and if you get to know locals. This is better than any guide book. it is Provence from within... Enjoy!"
2,Easy read,The book was o.k. Had some funny moments. A light read with moments that make you laugh & smile. Shows friendship transends cultures & language barriers.
3,delightful and light reading...,"for a brief introduction into provence and provencal life, i'd suggest you start with peter mayle's book. it's an engaging, witty travelogue that keeps readers hooked from page one (if you like that dry british sense of humor, i suppose, but who doesn't?). we progress with the author and his wife through the seasons in provence and witness their troubles with getting their house fixed in a timely manner, eating sumptuous french meals, the bustling markets, the friendly and idiosyncratic characters who they interact with, and the ups and downs with weather (the mistral is something i'd care not to experience). although perhaps mayle and his wife are a bit stodgy english caricatures, you can't help but love their british affectations which over the course of the novel fall more in line with the unhurried french way of life."
4,Delightful,"This book was a wonderful read. Funny, light, somewhat educational. Easy to read. Descriptive to the point that I felt I was there.GREAT!!"
4,Delightful memoir,"Peter Mayle and his wife fulfill a longtime fantasy by leaving their native England and living in Provence. The chapters of this book have titles of the months of the year as Mayle writes about the interesting weather and the more interesting inhabitants that they find in their adopted land during their first 12 months. Running throughout the book is the progress, or lack of progress, with the home renovation which is going on. Sometimes for no particular reason, the workers decide to go elsewhere or just take some time off from their labors. The French temperament dictates that time is of little importance, and work is not always valued as much as fellowship and breaking bread together. Author Mayle brings a wry, self-deprecating wit and a keen sense of observation to bear on the customs of Provence and this book is a humorous and delightful read."
5,"Clever and fun, a Year's Journey","I read this book years ago, along with it's 2 sequels, this being my favorite of 3. I've also often given it as a gift to friends preparing to go anywhere in France, and they've loved the humor of it / a taste of France / the French.Here's an idea...Imagine planning, and then giving a holiday party, inviting all your home improvement contractors, ""as well as their wives"", to... in a nice way...embarrass the contractors into ""finally"" finishing the jobs that have been dragging out for a full year of ""no shows"". I loved it became a time line competition to finish their individual jobs first."
3,A loquacious dinner guest.,"What lingers after reading ""A Year in Provence"" is certainly a positive impression. Peter Mayle has an aptitude for deftly producing, here and there, a memorable description or turn of phrase. Moreover, I know a lot more about the Provenal temperament and milieu after reading this book and, I must admit, experienced not a small amount of envy during some of the passages. However, do not approach this book with the lofty prepossessions that some of the reviews attempt to inspire. Reading ""A Year in Provence"" is like entertaining a well-informed, loquacious dinner guest who can transform the minutiae of his domestic details and incidental observations into an amusing, undemanding narrative. Expect nothing more. But also nothing less."
1,"Twee, boring and patronising",Who could imagine that such a dreary book could come from such a delighful place. It reads like the diary of an incompetent who fails to understand the people who he deals with and then puts this down to their being foreign. Avoid it at all costs!
2,A Year in Provence,This audio was well read and presented. I'm not a fan of this type books. Read it for book club. Another confirmation for me was to avoid abridged versions.
2,Mayle popularizes Provence to the masses,I thought it a bit odd that a man who dislikes tourists would write a book to popularize his favorite place to tourists the world over. I enjoyed the book but thought Peter Mayle is a bit of a hypocrite.
4,What may I have missed?,"I am presently reading this book in a French language edition. My French is ever-so-rusty, but I find myself laughing so much that I am about to purchase it in English -- just so I'll know whether or not I'm getting it all!"
3,Getting to know Provence,"It was kind of disappointing. I had heard excellent reviews from friends and from people who had been there. My wife and I are going to the Provence in mid September, so we wanted to get some input for the region.I rated the book 3 stars. Maybe because I was expecting something more than I got.In Brasil we have a saying that goes more or less like this:""The best of the party is to wait for it."""
5,Living vicariously through the author,"A Year in a Provence is a very enjoyable read. The book is short, so read slowly. The author made me feel like I was living and discovering Provence with him."
4,A Look at Provence,"Found this when planning a trip to Burgundy and Provence. Had read other books by Mayle and liked the way he described the area. Great insight, but also makes you appreciate what you have here."
4,Very fine escape from the mundane travel writing we see now.,"Mayle presents travel escapism at it's best, although this book should be digested in small portions to avoid the feeling that you've eaten too much candy. Mayle's Provencal lifestyle and the true, colourful characters he encounters in his day-to-day life are just the ticket for the hordes of stressed-out office workers who are still three months away from vacation who seem to read his books.In all, a book to be celebrated. Much better than Frances Mayes insensitive, griping, shallow ""My important vacations in Tuscany"" series."
5,the NERO Rulebook is Just What I Needed,"My first experiences with LARPs were tacky, back-yard, low-budget experiences which, although kind of fun once you got into them, never really immersed me in the game. NERO, on the other hand, is professional, well written, and is basically the best game I've played by far (which says a lot).The NERO rulebook is an excellent introduction to the game, and is all you need to get prepared for a NERO event. It also has a list of the websites and 40+ game chapters, so it's easy to find a chapter near you. The pictures really give you a feel for what the game is like, and that there are regular people that LARP, not /just/ obsessive gamer types.I highly reccomend this game and this book."
5,A rare anarcho-classic!,"Abbey's best work will always be his essays, but this novel is one of those ""forgotten"" dystopian classics that deserves much more attention. Forget Orwell's ""1984."" It's too European. Forget Levin's ""This Perfect Day."" It's too fantastic. Abbey has written the best post-apocalypse American novel to date. And his politics, as always, ring true. Up the rebels! An anarcho-classic"
3,"Nice characters, OK story","Honestly, the only reason I rented this movie was to see Vanna White, and maybe in the buff. I wasn't disappointed. The love scenes are tender and brief, but you do get a glimpse of Vanna's great assets. She is a beautiful woman. She's not a bad actress either. She should have done more pictures.I can't tell if this is pre-Wheel of Fortune, but the movie certainly looks and sounds dated, early '80s. It reminded me of Bobby Jo and the Outlaw, the only flick I know that Lynda Carter fully revealed the bosom that was jiggling most wonderfully in Wonder Woman.That aside, it is a nice story. No Oscar winner, but you care about what happens to the characters. The guy who plays the stunt pilot doubles up as singer on some of the songs on the soundtrack."
5,A great Eagles live album!!!,"This is a great live Eagles album!!! Contains live versions of their classic songs:Hotel California,Heartache Tonight,Desperado,The Long Run,New Kid In Town,Seven Bridges Road,Take It Easy,and many more!!! An awesome double live album(2 CD's these days!)from the Eagles!!!"
1,Boring!!,the most overdubbed recording in music history.absolutely no emotion.eagles have often been accused of loitering on stage.highlight seven bridges road. ...
4,Right before the 15 year vacation,"Right before the 15 year vacation, we got this live release of the Eagles. Classic release, sounds great on cd. Although typical perfect ""live"" versions of some classic Eagles, Joe Walsh stands out as comical as he is and as talented as he is. Some definite high points include ""Seven Bridges Road"", a great live version of ""Wasted Time"" and Joe Walsh's ""Life's Been Good To Me So Far""...a former friend of mine did me a favor by keeping my tape forcing me to replace it with the cd. If you have seen the Eagles in concert or if you are a fan, you will love this release."
2,Partially Live,"This is a fine recording of a great band. However I cannot recommend it and hence it only gets 2 stars.The reason for this is that you might have thought that with an album cover which says EAGLES LIVE this would actually be a live a album. But no its not, in fact if you read the credits you'll find that there are overdubs added. So it should be called EAGLES LIVE (EXCEPT FOR THE OVERDUBS WHICH WE ADDED AFTER THE CONCERTS). Now if they called it that I probably would have given it 4 stars.Shame, because the recordings are good, but if I wanted a studio quality recording, I'd have bought the original studio albums. Live is live, it can't be almost live unless its advertised as such!"
3,Songs are almost indistinguishable from the studio versions,"I'm a Eagles fan, and the songs on this album are the ones I'd pick to hear live. But they sound almost identical to the original recordings, possibly in part because of all the overdubbing that was done in the studio. To my mind, that defeats the purpose of a live album. Three stars for the great songs."
5,good book,we got this book for our 6yr old son whn our 2yr old son and 7yr old nephew were killed. our 6yr old didnt want to talk about his feelings so we helped him open up by getting him books for his age level.
4,Help me say goodbye,I was eager to use this book with my four yr. old daughter. She enjoyed some of the activities and drew nice pictures about her Poppa.
4,If variety is what you want...,this book contains a large variety of crochet potholder patterns that are easy to follow. great for making personalized surprise gifts.
2,Dust Collection is For Display Only,"Would I have purchased a sander without a dust collector? Absolutely not.Despite its appearance, this sander has little to no functional dust collection. Now that the room where I'm working is completely dusty after 15 minutes of sanding and I will have to clean it all up anyway, I will use this unfortunate product for the duration of my project and then send it on its way to Goodwill.I expected better from Black & Decker."
3,"Good sanding, horribly dusty","Thought this looked like all the others out there so figured I would get it since it is a few dollars cheaper. The sander sanded well and is easy to use.BUT the dust collector is horrible! The dust just blows right through the holes in the bag, out the sides of the sanding pad, everywhere!!! I was sanding a couple patch jobs down and my entire room filled with dust. I had to open all the windows to clear the air since it was like a cloud.I'd say if you are planning on only using this outside and using good breathing masks then go ahead. But personally I'm returning mine and buying one that has a better dust collector."
3,very useful guide book but with some missunderstanding,"I'm a Thai who have read this guide book. I would like to inform that there is some missunderstanding on the article ""The Monarchy"" (page 31). His Majesty The King Rama IX has composed many pieces, including the ""falling rain"" of course, but he did not compose the royal anthem. The ""falling rain"" is NOT the royal anthem. The royal anthem was composed by someone else."
4,"Not bad, but things change fast","LP has done a decent job covering the basics that you'll need to negotiate through Thailand. My advice as with most travelogues, never believe the prices as they always go up. Another piece of advice is to pick a spot before you get to a new destination and ask other travellers about that place. Some of the guest houses can change very quickly and a night spent at a cheap guesthouse that's noisy, dirty and maybe cockroach infested can be miserable. Enjoy Thailand and enjoy this book!"
1,Updated and convincing materials,"As a frequent traveler to Thailand I read the book with a certain amount of hesitation, becase many ""guide books"" are out-of-date. However, this manuscript really informs the traveler/tourist about a wonderful culture and society. We should not try to change or modify the Thai human spirit! We, in many instances, can learn from it. In the future writings I hope more about Nan Province can be told. A beautiful area with friendly people, beautiful mountains, no polution or automobile congestion, and a place to relax for a few days from a long flight."
1,AWFUL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I love Asian films especially Thai and Korean but this was a disaster. Poor acting, too much sex,not scary, just gross. I usually can't stop a movie after I begin to watch it even if its not very good because I always end up curious to see how it ends. However, I could only get through the first 40 minutes of this film. I DO NOT RECOMMEND!!!"
1,Save your money.,"This movie was wretched. I wasn't expecting much, but WOW. The acting, writing, camera, and the ghost, actually everything was done very poorly. It's like watching a soap opera, but this makes soap operas look amazing. If you like BAD Asian Horror, stick with Carved."
4,Smooth sounds for romance,"Step 1: Light some candles. Step 2: get a nice wine and some Brie. Step 3: put on the Love Project CD. Step 4: cozy up with the one you love.If you're looking for Coltrane or Miles, you're not gonna find it here. For better or worse, that's not the focus of the ""smooth jazz"" genre. What you will find are some tasty pieces from Jeff Lorber, Alex Bugnon, and Walter Beasley."
4,"Nancy Wilson & Ramsey Lewis's version of ""Moondance"" is immortal","This is a very nice compilation, but Nancy Wilson & Ramsey Lewis's version of ""Moondance"" makes me forget all other interpretations(no insult is intended to Van Morrison). This is a memorable piece that stays on my mind. Night on the town music."
3,JAK's worst,"This has to be one of JAK's WORST books. Don't get me wrong, she is one of my favourite authors and I feel nearly all her early works as Stephanie James and the others for Candlelight and Temptation hold up very well in reprint. In many instances, I think she demonstrates her shining talent, with a fresh spontaneity she is lacking in her last few hard backs. However, this is NOT one of them. The characters are dated, the situation, near ridiculous....sorry....just nothing going this.I disliked the female character especially. She goes from logical, level head person one minute, to this very whiny, spiteful, unrealitic woman the next. UGH, spare me.Save your money and buy Amaryllis, Zinnia or Orchid and have a much better time. This one should have been released like they did some of her (MUCH BETTER) Stephanie James and given a lower release price."
1,yep! I hated it.,"The hero is almost verbally abusive! The female is silly, immature and 'gamey'... I didn't even finish this book! Why would Krentz write such a story for women in the 90's?"
1,Disappointing and one-sided,"Mr. Silver writes best when he has a real writer alongside him, as in ""Great Balls of Fire"" with Myra Lewis. This work is a garbled and incomplete mess. I seriously doubt a real publisher would have picked it up. Mr. Silver picked wonderful subject matter for his book, the rich and storied histories in Savannah, but he can't capture it and the book has contridictions galore. The introduction is almost unreadable, the book is often boring and not as entertaining as the personality of the author. I met him at his shop in Savannah and I heard him say over and over that evening, "" I wrote Great Balls of Fire!"" by way of introduction. Kind of strange, but he was engaging enough that I wanted to read this new book he was signing. ""Moss Curtain"" was a waste of my time and it's not worth yours."
4,Excellent should be read by all.,A down to earth account of her life. A refreshing look at both our contemporary and yester year world.
2,very mediocre at best,"my son is 2 years-old and loves cars and trucks and i had hoped that this video would suit. he has already watched the baby einstein ""things that go"" to death. however, i was very disappointed when i got this video; it doesn't even come close to baby einstein. the supposed 3-D animation is pathetic and the video as a whole is very slow moving. my son watched it because he loves cars but he was straining to be engaged. it has two levels for younger children and older but the video is really for young infants to stare at objects on the screen that just sit there. waste of money!!!!!!!"
1,Lose fit,Item looks good but does not fit very well. In fact it is very lose. I had to use superglue to keep it in place.
4,Tailgate handle cover,The tailgate handle cover arrived with the tabs broken(both of them). Just like in the reviews. One email to Amazon and the seller replaced it free of charge. Amazon is awsome. The new one works just fine. Thanks Amazon.Johnny 69
5,tailgate handle bezel,I lost my original tailgate handle bezel and hated the way my truck looked without it. I have a 2004 chevy silverado and I like it when people think it looks newer than that. I want it to look good for as long as I can even though I use it as a work truck doing landscape work. This replacement part looks just like the original and was a snap to install.
1,dang,"Breaks immediately. I put one on the tailgate of my dad's '01 Silverado. It fit perfectly, snapped right into place, then we tried to open the tailgate. The product was in the way of the tailgate handle and broke the snap-hooks that held it on. The product fell right off."
4,Installed easy and quick.,I received order quick and had it installed in a couple of minutes.Can't tell difference in it and the original.
2,What a lucky group of subhumans,"The fact that Jeff Foxworthy got another chance after his dismal and nauseating sitcom must be in the hands of ethereal beings. His stand-up comedy is good, and transcends socio- and economic borders, providing humor for the lowliest of poverty-ridden cretins to the enjoyment of despied and well-off yuppies. However, anyone so into the humor of Jeff and his cronies that they would actually purchase an extended version of what was sympatheticaly displayed on tv... well i personally question that purchaser's sanity."
2,No charge!,"I also had a problem w/ camera not recharging ... just about the time the warranty expired. Don't know if it was the cradle or the camera...Casio wanted $199 to fix. No thanks! No more Casio cameras for me.Up until then, I would give it 3.5 stars. While the size was supposed to be the selling point, I always felt it was almost too small.Lag time between clicking shutter and ""taking"" the picture drove me nuts!"
2,Expensive to fix...,"I received this camera as a Christmas gift last December. I thought it was a decent camera - it was compact and had a lot of great features. My only complaint initially was the lag time between shots. Then over the summer, my cradle quit charging the camera for no appearant reason. Since this was a gift, I did not have the receipt so I could not take advantage of the warranty. Casio is charging around $200 to fix the problem. This seems a little on the high side considering the camera isn't even a year old. I won't be buying any more Casio products nor would I recommend them to anyone."
3,"solid optics, hate the docking station","there may be a way to recharge the battery on this camera w/o using the docking station but I have yet to determine it - due to this limitation I give this camera three stars as it takes much of the flexibilty away - which is exactly why you'd buy a camera this small...other than that, the interface is solid, the optics great and the size and weight make it fun to play with."
5,Fabulous,I've owned a digital camera for several years but had difficulty viewing the screen especially under well lit conditions. The Casio solved that issue thanks to its crisp 2 inch monitor! Even though I sometimes wear glasses I have had no difficulty using the viewfinder. The camera responds quickly. E'm very pleased with the shots I have taken in the past month utilizing many of the features (they are a lot of fun). There is no need for an owner's manual thanks to the graphical display of information on the screen. The movie function is a fun addition although the resolution is somewhat weak.
2,It's a weak fan,"This ""Air King"" is NOT ""Industrial Grade"" it is ""Baby's Room Grade"" because it doesn't move much air. At high speed it only blows a gentle downdraft. I mean, it's worth 56 bucks but don't expect much out of it. Darn."
2,Beautiful but moves very little air,"I love the look but am disappointed. It turns at very high speed even on low. It moves very little air even when the blades are swirling around at 1000mph making a lot of noise there is barely a breeze. People keep asking me it is is turning backwards. It's not, it just doesn't work well."
2,Poorly written,"Disjointed writing, just a collection of ""war stories"" with an abrupt ending. Does not shed any light on the profession."
1,Reads like an extra long Reader's Digest story,"This subject of this book should be enough to make it a page turner. But...it's really not my type of book. It actually reminds me of the books I used to read in 6th grade -- lots of corny dialogue (often ""muttered"" in head of the author, to herself), manufactured personal drama, and, for good measure, a juvenile story about flatulence in the first chapter. I think it's a fine book for people who like this author's writing style, but it definitely wasn't my thing at all. I much prefer books like COUNTY: Life, Death and Politics at Chicago's Public Hospital by David Ansell, M.D., in which the author provides a bit of reflection and insight to go along with the medical situations he attends to. I wish I had not spent money on this book"
5,More Please,I purchased the first TJ. and I had such a awesome time reading it. It was so detailed that it created this amazing picture in my head. I am really familiar with the organization and reading this book gave me some history of it. I really just hands down enjoyed this book and I truly LOVED it. I totally think if your interested in EMS and Flight nursing you should read this!
2,boring,as an RN who's been thru trauma the way this is written is dull. i don't know who thought reading this was a good prep for skills. there's better out there.
3,Interesting,"This was pretty good for as low budget as it was. I was a little miffed by the lack of storyline. A group of IDF soldiers come into a house, requistion it and the family lives downstairs. They stretched that into about 90 minutes. I wish they could have developed the characters more. I was also somewhat let down by the fact that there was no mention of Palestinian terrorists and the role they play in making the lives of Palestinian miserable. If it wasn't for terrorism, the Israeli army wouldn't need to have a presence in the West Bank. All said and done it wasn't horrible but it wasn't fantastic either."
5,Best Jr. High Material EVER,"This is truly excellent work! This is by far the best material I've seen for Jr. Highers.1) It actually hits at the right level... not too old, not too young. It makes simple clear points, and helps students wrestle with concepts in concrete ways.2) It deals with theology and knowledge, but always brings it back to application. You don't just learn about God, but you talk about how to be LIKE him.3) I can actually put this in the hands of a volunteer... ANY volunteer. There are big plans, but with simple, last-minute versions. It is workable for a first-time Sunday School teacher or a long-term vet. There are great teaching moments for the leaders about the unique needs of middle school ministry. AND (best of all) my volunteers look like the coolest people in the world.This has been the best curriculum purchase I've made in the last year or so. I highly recommend it."
1,Not that good,"I read through this book from cover to cover and decided it wasn't going to work with my group. Since the book has little content, it tries to compensate with fun activities which aren't really that fun. This book probably isn't going to be an effective resource for anyone."
3,"Not as many ""great"" ideas as I thought","If your looking for a way to celebrate your heritage and culture, this book has many great ideas on how to incorporate ethnic traditions. But otherwise, I really didn't find many original ideas that truly would make my wedding unique. Instead, most were silly and impracticle."
5,Fun to read with several ideas you can really use.,What a great planning resource! The book is loaded with creative ideas like the personlized drink menu. Everyone really enjoyed all the unique ideas that we used in both our ceremony and reception.
3,Garland is Great! Plot is Thin!,"Garland is superb, as always. She had to try extra hard in this one because the songs she is given to sing are not up to her standard. But Judy, in her genius, makes them work. She also makes up for the deficiencies in the thin plot. I expected more but didn't receive more. This film could have been superb on all counts if the screenwriters had only had the gumption to give the script a little more than soap. There are a lot of could have beens and what ifs in this picture, which sadly was Garland's last film. She never fails to impress though and she brings the material up to her level and proves that even at her worst, she was still better than the best at their best!!"
4,NOT A CLASSIC BUT STILL GOOD,"This film is not really what I would call a musical as it lacks that bit of magic fairy dust that were in most of garland's other films although no musicals past 1958 are up to the standard of the musicals of the golden age.The drama and dramatic acting in this is however fantasic, Garland really shows that not only was she an amazing singer but an amazing actress as well and the supporting characters are also great especially the bloke that went on to be 'Quincy'; Bogarde goes well with Garland.There is only one nitpick I have though, I thought it was an unwritten law that all musicals [especially Judy Garland ones] were supposed to live 'and they all lived together happily ever after'?"
2,"sad, sadder, saddest","What a shame this was the last movie Garland made and the 1st one singing on screen since ""A Star Is Born"". A paycheck is a paycheck,and so Judy needed the money. The parts are very miscast, the story line embarressing. ""BlueBird"" and ""By Myself, Alone- shine. The title song- a joke. Lorna and Joey Luft appear on screen as over interested extras on a boat. Judy deserved better and the Oscar for ""A Star Is Born"""
5,A CLASSIC film for us Garland fans,"""I could go on Singing""is like watching a reality movie.Alot of the film was method acting,and Garland re-wrote alot of the script.The last scene when she's being told she MUST GO OUT and PERFORM,and says,""The hell with them.I'm tired of being treaded like a piece of meat""I could see why this movie wasn't at hit,but for a Garland fan,its a CLASSIC.Judy was ridding a HUGE comeback in the 60's,with her Carnigie Hall performace,and 4 grammy awards for her #1Live album,and Oscar nomanation,and TV show,there was no stopping her.I probally have seen this movie 10times,and still enjoy it."
5,Judy Garland's last film showcases her tremendous talent,"I Could Go On Singing, Judy Garland's last film, showcases her tremendous talent. The musical numbers in the film leave you in awe of her incredible voice. Most of her costuming is great, but a few outfits were very unflattering to the point of distracting and laughable, particularly the ""red dress"" number. A classic song, covered well by Judy, was diminished greatly by an outfit which made her look clownish. As far as the film goes, it was not Academy Award material, acting or plot, simply watched waiting for the next Garland number. Over all, viewable for the few song sequences, a bit of Hollywood nostalgia and for satisfying a Judy craving"
4,the lady still has it,"""I Could Go on Singing"" warrants most of the criticism & praise it's received - over-the-top soap opera with Garland edgy & brimming, her voice spilling over the lines like a none-too-carefully-wielded crayon in a coloring book, but the colors are vivid and the pleasures here are significant - even if they come more from incidentals than the central meat. Garland was just so SMART, innately: her intelligence and wit inform many lovely little asides and inflections - her speaking voice insinuates & encompasses with the musical dark flush of a viola. She's great to watch - even if the film itself is a pretty hoary flapping affair. However varying the quality of the material or its expression, you can't take your eyes off her."
2,Cheap Analog Phone,"The conference phone ordered from the Price Pros may or may not have been functional. Either way, it was not the right item for the system we had in our small business office, so we returned it. First it took the Price Pros forever to give us an RMA #, then it took forever to get credit. Perhaps this all could have been avoided had they posted an accurate description for the item on Amazon."
1,Outdated and DANGEROUS,"Givens wrote this book in the ""dark ages"" of player restoration. Time has shown that many materials and techniques used when Givens wrote this book can cause extreme damage to your valuable instrument! Buy Art Reblitz' book, it is much better!"
2,dn't know if it works or not,"I bought these things because I really hate silverfish in my apartment. Before I used them I only found silverfish in my bathroom. At first I put a big one (for large room) in the living room and one week later I found a silverfish on the wall just 1 foot distance from this repeller. After that I got two for medium room and I put one in my bedroom and one in my bathroom. Several weeks later I found one silverfish in my bedroom (near the repeller) then I thought these things might be pest attractors. So I unplugged the one in my bedroom and put it in the kitchen. But I still found silverfish in my bedroom and bathroom, and living room, but no one in the kitchen until now. Hmm, now I think these stupid things are just night lights."
1,"Black & Decker EX420-2P-D6 Ultrasonic Pest Repeller Nightlight, Medium Room (2 Pack)","This product was purchased to eliminate (i.e.: get rid of) cockroaches in our apartment. So far they have failed to a spectacular degree. With 6 units (or 3x2 packs) running, the roaches seem to be very comfortable with them. So much so that they use the slit openings in each unit to raise new families.I saw a rise in their population around the one in the bathroom (because of the good lighting, and because it is viewed most oftem). Newly hatched ones always seemed to be present around the unit. Thinking this very unlikely I removed it from the wall and shook it. This caused a mass exit of young ones as well as their larger parents. QED!"
3,I think it works,"Using this at the camp may not be a fare test. But it seems to have made a difference, guess I should buy a couple more."
2,It Helped,"Well, these devices didn't totally get rid of our little rodent roommates, but with these plugged up in my room, I knew they would stay away. To make a long story short, I wanted to get an exterminator but my roommate didn't, so I figured this would be the best way to keep them out of my area."
2,So-so,"Where I live, we have a lot of spiders (and their webs). Put four of these in spots around the condo, there was a slight decrease in spider activity but nothing fantastic as I think it could be contributed to temperature change. I bought these in Sept/Oct so I'll reserve final judgment until the Spring. If you have a few extra dollars, buy these, if not - just kill the bugs yourself."
1,Did a Whole Lot of Nothing,"I loved the idea. Wow, plug this thing in and scare away your pests. I read the directions, did everything it said and still saw spiders and an occasional wood roach from outside. I hate wood roaches and have been trying everything I can to make my house less attractive for them. I guess I will try some professional stuff now along with some dicotamous earth (spelling?)"
1,Don't waste your money!,"The only reason I gave it a star at all is that I couldn't post unless I did. I would actually give it MINUS 3 stars! I bought a 5 pack of these, hoping they would keep the bugs outside. Instead, they gave the bugs a place to live. They crawl into the slots. At least I know where they are when I get out the bug spray. Worthless waste of money!!! They DO NOT WORK!"
2,pest repeller,"I am not sure if it works, i have 4 of them plus a huge one and i still have lots of spiders and one spider actually made a home right next to the big one."
2,Repeller ?,"It is premature to see if this works but I plugged the unit into the Lanai (what you call a back porch). I was walking around when I noticed a large spider less than 2 feet from the repeller weaving a web. Not exactly working, as of yet, eh?I will give more feedback when I have long term experience. For now, it's a little hokey.UPDATE:It's not effective. Too bad I cannot return it. I hired Terminix to use good old chemicals.At least it doubles as a nightlight. That's all it's good for."
3,Ultrasonic pest repeller,"The product works great, if you follow the directon to change the locations ferquently. I put the repellers on extension cords making this task quite easy. I live in a highly populated and large apartment complex. THese repellers keep my neighbor's bugs from coming to my unit."
4,Nice TV Special,"No reason to complain! You get it for a great low price. The overall TV special isn't that great, but you get some clips of cartoons not yet on DVD, like ""Hare Splitter,"" ""Wild Over You,"" and ""Little Beau Pepe."" There's also two bonus cartoons- ""Past Perfumance"" and ""Holiday Highlights."" I recommend this, especially for those of us who love Pepe, and despise the reluctance to give him a disc of his own."
5,Excellent,"Excellent book for 6th graders I highly recommend the book for your kid to review next year concepts, easy to follow and a lot of excersices"
3,Not for an Amateur...,"I bought this book with the hopes of getting a good step by step introduction as to how to start my own Inc. business. Turns out the author's presentation was way out of my league and was geared toward people who already have an established business. This book is mostly about the tax benefits a a established business would get if it Incorporated itself....This isnt a ""How To-Getting Started"" Book for people wanting to start their own business for the first time. Also, too many figures and too many numbers, and the language used was very complex...the type of language people would get their lawyers to interpret for them.However, I did get something out of this book, and that is to start a corporation, the pros and cons of each type of corporation, and the do's and don'ts. It's not a How to do...so I would recommend reading a book on HOW to start your own business, and then once you know how to, then read Inc. Yourself.Overall, it was worth the read."
2,"How did this get to be called ""a classic?""","I really do not know why this is in it's 10th edition or on it's 25 anniversary. I purchased the book thinking it would be a useful introduction to the benefits of incorporation and guidance for the benefits / drawbacks to each form of corporation. The discussion is more suitable for someone with significant exposure to corporate structure who is looking for fine tune their strategies - perhaps an accountant or a tax attorney. While I (a physician) could often understand what the author was trying to communicate, I found her approach confusing."
1,"A great start, but slim on content","This book introduces many key concepts of incorportation, but doesn't go into enough depth. I have read the same incorporation issues covered in greater depth in books on taxes or small business survey books. Over a third of the book is reprinted forms, padding the length of the text. Very disappointing."
2,Hard to read on Kindle,This book has a lot of use full information regarding starting your own corporation. The problem is that there are many forms and charts used as examples. These forms and charts are unreadable on the Kindle. I would not recommend buying the Kindle edition.
5,Great Find,I remember watching this on PBS when I was a kid and I was so excited to see this on DVD. It's a great production with a great cast. I like that the play features both Alice in Wonderland AND Through the Looking Glass. As a Lewis Carroll fan I was happy to see how closely the play follows the books.
4,Good...not great.,I am a HUGE Nathan Lane fan. The only reason I bought this was for Nathan Lane and he (and the rest of the cast) is fantastic! The woman who played Alice (whos name for some reason I can't remember) isn't good. Nathan Lane is the highlight. Very good and a must have for any theatre or Nathan Lane fan.
2,Mediocre Prison caper with good cast,"When Peter Sellers takes the lead rather than a character part in an ensemble cast, warning bells ring. In this mediocre British comedy, Sellers plays a crook in prison, a prison more like a health farm. This must be one of his weakest performances. There is little opportunity for the mimicry which really was his specialty. Without that, Sellers is simply not much of an actor and dull to boot. With a familiar cast of British comedians, in particular the always hilarious Irene Handl, the film has some amusing lines but most of the jokes are too broad without the subtlety of the best of British. There are also some very coarse moments which are worthy of 3rd rate music hall comedy.It is worth noting that the print is good but there are no extras."
5,Great Spoon,This spoon is wonderfully balanced and very comfortable in the hand. Its flat end makes it ideal for making smoothly blended gravies and sauces as well as serving them over your favorite sauteed meats. It's truly multi-purpose serving well as a spatula for braising meat chunks or handling stir-fry vegetables.I've been looking for a spoon like this for over a year now and I'm so glad I finally found it.
2,watch heel!,"Bought these for my son to use for soccer and t-ball. Good price, but gotta do something different. The back of the heel sticks up and rubs the ankle. The cleats are better for turf than grass or dirt. Would be okay for his age if it weren't for the heel issue.Fit was good. They also have a lace flap that is apparently tucked in for their photo."
2,TOO SMALL,"My 9 year old wears a 3 1/2 shoe and I bought these a half size bigger in a 4. His foot would not go in them. They fit more like his brothers size 2 shoe. I returned them the same day,"
4,Solid Cleat,"I purchased this cleat for my 8 year old to play indoor soccer on turf during his off season. It fits well sung but does not pinch his feet. They run true to size, my son's food is narrow to medium, so I would not suggest these for a person with a wide foot. Overall, a solid purchase at an excellent price."
1,Skip this one; go on to really good Walters,"For almost 600 pagers the author examines a double crime in 1970 from every single angle and viewpoint. It becomes excruciatingly dull, especially when we are force-fed the red-tape police files (yet additional versions of the versions we have already read). A hackneyed opening plot line about dissatisfaction with ones own race and identity is disposed of early, but not replaced by anything of interest or usefulness to the story. Forget this one; Walters has other very fine mysteries for you."
1,Sooooo Bad,"This was my 11th Walters' books and I'm thankful that it wasn't my first as it would have been my last. I read about 20 books a month so I think I have a good opinion on what's good and what's not!:) I had such a hard time keeping up with all the various characters and who was who and why. As one character stated in the book, "" Couldn't see the wood for the trees. "" Considering this is her most recent work, maybe she is just wrung dry????????????"
2,Not up to her usual standards,"I was extremely disappointed with this book. Walters' other books (particularly her early ones) are marked by graceful writing, subtle character development, (at times) creepy psychological insights into the more twisted parts of human nature, and well paced suspense. This book missed on all four counts. I wondered initially why the book was not released first in hardcover in the United States; having read it, I think I know why."
4,Couldn't put it down,"This book kept me engaged thoroughly. I didn't want to stop reading. I read it within a day because I didn't want to put it down. While, I will admit the ending was a little weak, the overall story and look into the psychology of the characters was very interesting."
2,Monotonous and verbose - not the usual Minette Walters fare!,"I agree with those in the majority who have reviewed this book. It was a terribly boring story and hard to follow at times. I am a huge Minette Walters fan. In my opinion, she's right up there with Ruth Rendell. She normally writes very captivating stories with a true storyteller's touch but this veered off in quite a different direction than anything else I have read by her. The word by word e-mails from one character to another were dreadful. I found myself skimming over them. It appeared to me that they were put there to take up page space because they certainly were not there to enrich the story or provide anything of interest. There wasn't even really a mystery here. It was obvious what was going on right away. I did not care for this book one bit. The two star rating is because I do love this author and one star would just be shameful (although two stars seems generous)."
3,"Worth reading, weak last 3rd","As has been said, this isn't Walter's best book or top third. But it's worth reading for the interplay between Jon and George, who could be further pursued as characters in the future. But the last third of the book leaves much dropped or weakly resolved and lacking in drama. So read it for the characters and the change in writing styles. It's not boring, just a disheartening ending.Sure doesn't compare to Elizabeth George.."
3,"horrible childhoods, good interplay of relationships","There have been a lot of reviews already written about this book, so won't retell the plot. Several of the people involved, especially Cill, Howard and Louise, had the most horrendous childhoods which contained bullying, beating and parental abuse. This part is not pleasant reading. What I did enjoy however, is the way that Walters developed the characters and especially the interplay between George and Jonathan. Have read all of Walter's books and would not call this the best one but it was a good read."
3,Good but preachy,"This is an interesting and complex mystery, one that kept me going for a while. The characters are likable (the good guys, anyway), though Jonathan Hughes is tiresome when we first meet him. It seems that the author used this book to go on about the war in Iraq, which is fine had she done it a bit more intelligently. Jonathan, who is half Jamaican and half Chinese, tries to pass as an Arab and gets into some trouble for it in the wake of 9/11. There's a lot of this in the beginning but then the author simply lets it drop, as though years of Jonathan's neuroses are healed by George Gardner, the woman who helps him solve the case. There are some nice scenes between the two of them, especially when they first meet. Overall a good read; I may try another of the series, but I'm not running to the bookstore."
2,Disordered Editing,"You can usually rely on Minette Walters for a seminar on criminally disturbed minds. There's some of that in this novel but it's way, way too long. Ms. Walters introduces us to an interesting character in George (female), a councillor trying to unravel a couple of long-ago murders blamed on a young man with mental disabilities. She teams up with a professor with an enormous chip on his shoulder.The two of them go off investigating and the book bogs down into hypothesis after hypothesis after hypothesis. It just goes on and on. If it hadn't been a Minette Walters book I would have put it down unfinished, but I kept hoping it was going to click into gear. It didn't.Where was the editor? The book could have been whacked down to about half its length."
5,half face piece regulator,"I got this face piece on the next to the last day of my welding class so I got to use it for those 2 days and am still using it at home when I am welding it really works great in filtering out the dust from grinding, welding, and also the dust from the slag that is produced from cleaning the weld. All I can say is that it is a great asset to my welding class and also when I am doing wood working in my shop"
5,A great protection from 3M,"I was working with an extremely smelly paint from Holland. Once I put on this mask, the odor became a non-issue. It was relatively comfortable and easy to breath. Good job, 3M!"
4,Easy to use and worked well,The fit was good and easy to set up. Used it in cold weather so I had a lot of condensation. Worked well
2,"""What a cheap toy!""","My mother had bought this toy before my son was born, we saw on the comercials how the baby would rattle the rattle and pooh was suppost to shake. Well, when my son was finally old enough to play with the toy it didn't work, as far as rattling the rattle the bear wouldn't shake, we had to keep pressing the tummy for it to shake. So we end buying new batteries for the toy and that wasn't it, it just didn't work, i was so upset to have my mom by such a cheap toy, it was false advertisement!!"
2,This toy teaches patience!,"This toy will definitely teach patience to my daughter because she shakes the rattle non-stop and Pooh refuses to dance! Since the day I opened it and put the batteries in, it only works half the time. Sometimes I see my daughter hitting Pooh over the head with the rattle because she's frustrated he doesn't move. Even when she hits him, he still only moves half the time! Don't waste the money... there are many other toys on the market that are more enjoyable for your child!"
1,Scary Pooh,"This Pooh looks like he is having a seizure! He's pretty freaky in our opinion. And I don't like the ""baby"" look; he doesn't even look like Pooh."
5,So much fun!,"My 7 month old son got this toy for Easter and it is so much fun! He mastered shaking the rattle to get Pooh dancing right away. I was pleased to see he actually learned to operate it on his own so quickly. His big sisters enjoy playing with it, too! He also likes to play with the rattle apart from the stuffed toy."
1,JUNK (NOT WORTH THE MONEY),When Our daughter was born our son (8 years old) saw this on T.V. and had to get it for her for Christmas. We could not find it. When we did find it our son could not wait for christmas not to se what he was getting but so he could give his sister now 8m what he thought was the best toy around. Then Christmas morning came and we opened it for her. Our son is now heart broken because no one can make it work the only way to make it work is to press pooh's tummy. At this point I am going to call Fisher Price but from what I have read from other people that have this toy I don't hold out much hopeWHAT A WAST OF $50.00 + TAX OF 15%
2,Surprised the value hasn't gone down in a year,"My mother-in-law bought this Pooh for my daughter for Christmas 2002. It was difficult for my then 7 month old daughter to use. you need to put the rattle in front of Pooh's rattle to make it go, and my daughter wants to wave teh rattle more freely. After a year, my daughter is still having a hard time with it, so we just push Pooh's stomach to make him dance and sing. I figured this item would be gone by now, but I see it is still selling big this year. Definitely not worth $25, in my opinion."
3,By Daddy's Girl,"My grandma got this one for me at my 1 year birthday. It's really cute, giggles when you hug it, and dances when you shake any rattle, clap or loud noises, like daddy's keys. It's not that much fun though. I only really play with it, when someone turns it on for me and shows it to me. Pooh is a little heavy to carry around like a doll, and too hard to cuddle with."
2,Most kids that come around get scared of him,"This was given to my daughter for her first birthday. She was instantly scared of him (first toy that has ever happened with). It has been 3 months and she still gets upset when he wiggles, if he just sits there she likes him. There were 3 other kids her same age at her party and they all had the same reaction, maybe it was a chain reaction but I have yet to meet a mom who's baby is not a little leery of him to begin with."
2,Safe your money on something else,"We searched everywhere locally for this toy and was unable to find it for our daughter. Finally, I decided to check on Amazon.com and ordered it and it arrived promptly. We couldn't wait to let her play with the Magic Rattle Pooh. OMG!! I can't even shake the rattle correctly to get him to move....how is a child going to get the pooh to dance? If you were interested in this product you might want to save your money or buy some other Pooh product..."
1,Not very fun,My daughter received this toy for her 1st birthday. It's a cute concept -but it doesn't work. You have to be very close while you are shaking the rattle and you have to shake it very hard. And I can't understand a thing that Pooh is saying! My daughter loves to shake the rattle - but I wouldn't recommend this toy.
1,This toy is a RIP OFF!!,"My mother bought this toy before my son was even born... we saw on the comercials how the baby shakes the rattle and winnie the pooh is supposed to shake, yeah right that rattle doesn't do anything you have to keep pushing the toys stomach to make it move. It was a waste of money!What a RIP OFF!!"
3,Not So Great,"We bought the Magic Rattle Pooh for my 2 year old daughter after she fell in love with it at the toy store. She likes to sing and dance along with Pooh, but rarely uses the rattle. She usually presses his belly because the rattle has to be right in front of him to work. For the price, I would not recommend this toy."
4,Not very impressed,"The concept for this toy is good. Our daughter, at 5 months, figured out very quickly how to make Pooh go. However, we also found that it broke very quickly and that you basically have to pound Pooh with the rattle to get it to go. We actually found that one of our daughter's other rattles worked better as a trigger than the one Pooh came with and was also easier for her to hold. The Pooh rattle is quite bulky for little hands. Overall, given that this toy is far from cheap, I would not recommend it at all."
5,WONDERFUL Learning Toy,"I bought this toy for my daughter before I thought she was even old enough to figure it out. She amazed me (about 5 or 6 months old, I think) and knew that when she shook the rattle, or shrieked at a certain pitch, that it made pooh sing and dance. She is 17 months old now, and still loves playing with it. This will be the toy I buy for all my friends' children - if I can ever find it again!!!"
2,Not easy to use,"I bought this for my son when he was 5 months old, he likes it but everytime he shakes the rattle pooh won't wiggle and play music, I have to shake the rattle for him to work. Pooh will wiggle and play music based on noise, but as for the rattle working like a remote control, as advertised, it does not work unless an adult is using it, which defeats the whole purpose."
1,What a disappointment,"We bought this toy for our 6 month old for Christmas because it looked very cute on T.V. It is really hard to get the thing to shake! I thought it was just running low on battery power so I changed the battery but still...getting Pooh to shake and sing takes work! My son cant make him dance on his own, you have to shake the rattle very hard right in front of the toy. Cute premise, but pretty useless in its design. Im pretty disappointed."
2,We're a little jaded.,"I also was dissapointed by this toy. The commercial on tv makes it look like a blast, and my son loves winnie the pooh. We would always show it to him in the store and he would smile and reach for it. Finally, we bought it when he was 8 1/2 months old and he could care less about it. My husband and I play with it more than him trying to show him what to do.After you press pooh's stomach, you shake the rattle near pooh's rattle which can be a little tricky sometimes. My son just winds up putting the rattle in his mouth and playing with the rattle alone. Hopefully he'll grow into it so we don't feel like we wasted the money.One sidenote though; One time my son was crying loudly and I was trying to cheer him with the toy and I noticed it is also activated by screaming children!!!!!"
1,You must know magic if you can get it to work....,"We received the Magic Rattle Pooh as a Christmas gift for our infant son. There were no instructions with the toy. I had to come to this website to learn the mechanics of how the toy operated. I was unable to get Pooh to ""magically"" wobble by shaking the rattle. The dog likes it when the we manually activate the toy, but the motion sensor only sensed my anger and frustration and failed/refused to respond. I'm also dissatisfied at the Fisher Price/Mattel consumer response website. It's a one-way only email, requiring the consumer to further waste his or her time with holding on a 800 number in an attempt to get a response to their questions/issues. I see no reason for the consumer to sit on hold when the company created the problem. The consumer should be able to get a response at his or her convenience since the consumer is not at fault."
1,It's Awful!,I am also extremely disappointed. What a piece of junk! I can't believe you could not find them in the stores at Christmas! The rattle works 1/2 the time and baby loses interest. Shame on Disney!
1,Don't waste your money,"My son received this toy as a Christmas present, and I sure wish I had read the reviews here before throwing away the packaging, because I would definitely take this toy back for a refund. What a waste! Like the other reviewers, I could not get the rattle sensor to work, nor does it move by just moving the toy around. The only way it works is if you press it's tummy.What a piece of junk. Don't waste your money on this one!"
3,Don't buy it for the Magic Rattle,"I got this for my daughter for Christmas. I wanted to try it out before I wrapped it and I can't get it to work. It only works when I push his tummy. I can't get the rattle to make him move at all...I'm 32. If I can't do it, then I'm sure my daughter won't be able to figure it out! Maybe there is a certain batch that don't work? If so, I got one of those. Not sure if I will return it. I wanted Dancing Bear but couldn't find it. Maybe I will keep looking and exchange it. I still think it's cute, but doesn't do what it says."
2,Terrible,I bought this toy for my daughter last Christmas. She was not impressed and either was I. The rattle has to be directly in front of Pooh or he will not work. The advertisement was very decieving. I would not reccomend this toy for any child.
2,Pooh doesn't do anything,"I got this magic rattle pooh bear for my daughter, that would laugh everytime she saw it on our t.v. and she is only 7 months old. So my boyfriend and I went out and got it for her. We get cute little pooh home and the only thing he did was say ""hello my name is pooh"" and that was pressing on his belly. Now the rattle situation I just don't understand how a 6 month old is suppose to make him dance with the rattle if a grown adult can't even get it to respond to the rattle at all. I have read some reviews on this toy and some say there is a plastic tab that neds to be removed where is this tab? Then he may work! Who knows!!"
3,"Very cute, but I agree with the others........","I saw the commercial for this and immediately made my husband run to Babies R Us to pick it up! It is very, very cute but I agree with the others.....you definitely have to have the rattle at a specific angle and really close to Pooh. Our six month old got it to rattle on his own maybe twice. I think the rattle needs to be more sensitive and respond at a farther distance and at any angle. Our dog got a hold of this last night and actually ate the rattle that Pooh is holding, so it looks like we wont get to experiment with this any further. I am sad to say, because it is so cute, I don't think it is worth replacing."
3,Cute toy but not durable,"My mother bought this toy for my daughter for Christmas 2003. She was so excited to give it to her. She got it Christmas eve and by new years Pooh wouldent shake his head anymore. We exchanged it for a new one, but with alot of hassle because Pooh has since changed. The Rattle is different, the texture of Pooh is different and Pooh's shirt is different. Anyway Pooh is since OK but we will see what happens. If he breaks again i will be calling Fisher Price."
1,Disappointing,"We bought this as a gift for our 6 month old daughter. She liked it at the store but when we got home, she played for about 3 minutes and then left it alone. She doesn't really play with it anymore (except when she's mad and throws it), but the rattle came in handy. She chews on that to help her in the teething proccess. Pooh may talk clearly at first but it gets harder and harder to understand him."
3,Cute and fun....for me only,"After reading the not-so-good reviews from this page yesterday, I still gave it a shot and went to get this toy from [the store].... This pooh danced and sang when I shaked the rattle lightly, it responded to other sounds like baby's crying, loud conversations etc. It worked exactly like what you see in the commercial, and I like it very much. There's one thing though, if you let it idle for too long, you have to press its tummy to reset it, and will get it sound-sensitive again. However, my boy, now 9.5 month, more interested in exploring his environment than playing with this toy, ie opening cabinets, crawling to the kitchen etc. All the ADULTS in the family loves it, maybe not him. So it's hard to rate this toy."
2,where's the magic?,My sister bought pooh for my 7 month old for christmas. It is now January and the paint is chipping off of the rattle that my son likes to chew on. Pooh doesn't move unless you press his stomach or move the rattle on top of the other rattle. I was very disappointed with this product and was alarmed that the paint was coming off. I had to throw away the rattle.
1,Not worth the chance!,"We purchased Pooh for our 9 month old for Christmas, we were very frustrated to find that between 4 adults we COULD NOT get Pooh to respond to his rattle! I thought that perhaps we had gotten a lemon, but looking at other reviews our problems with Pooh are not an isolated case. Seems as though you either get a Pooh that works or doesn't. Loud noises do seem to ""set him off"", but if loud noise is the only way to get this Pooh to dance...forget it!Don't waste your money hoping your Pooh works!"
4,Doesn't work,"I bought this for my 6 month old son and we just can't get it to work at all. No matter where and how we shake the rattle, nothing happens. We pulled the sensor cover out and changed the batteries and the only way we can get it to dance is to push his belly. When he does dance, it is really cute and my son's face just lights up. I'd return it but my son is really into rattles to chew on so I guess we'll just use it as 2 toys in one box"
2,Cute for a while.,My son received this when he was less than a year old. It didn't get his attention right away. He'd watch Pooh dance and sing but it didn't excite him. He'd play with it if it's the only toy around but he'd chose other toys if he could. It's cute but isn't soft enough to cuddle with. It also requires a large movement or sound to activate it.
1,Don't waste your money,"This toy has a really good idea for play but it does not work. On tv the toy started dancing and singing with just a small shake of the rattle, in order to get this toy to work you need to shake the rattle very hard. I would suggest to anyone do not buy this toy."
3,A DISAPPOINTMENT,"We recently bought this toy for our son who is 6 months old after seeing the commercials. It is a cute idea but needs some improvements. First, Pooh's voice is very unclear and hard to understand. Second, the child's rattle needs to be shook vigorously in order to get the toy to work. The rattle needs to be at a certain proximatly and angle to get the toy to respond. Even my husband and myself have had difficulty getting it to work. Also, the toy needs to be pushed in the stomach to get started. We have found that we need to do this for our son. He is still too little to know how to do that on his own, even though it says it is for his age. Our son prefers to just play with the rattle itself and doesn't really seem interested in the stuffed toy. Maybe he will become more interested as he gets older. I would recommend saving your money on a toy that is more educational and of a better quality."
2,NOT AS CUTE AS THE COMMERCIAL,"We saw the commercial for this toy and immediatly wanted to get it for our son who is 6 months. After unwrapping it, which took quite a while due to the packaging we were somewhat disappointed. In order to get Pooh to dance etc. the baby's rattle needs to be very close to the toy. The baby also needs to ""really"" shake his rattle quite vigorously to get Pooh to work. The toy itself is cute but smaller than imaged in the commercial. One other drawback..... to get the toy to start his tummy has to be pushed. We find that we need to do that for our son. The dancing and music captures my son's attention. Unfortunatly, Pooh's voice is very distorted and hard even for adults to understand. This was a very good idea for a toy but could use some improvements."
1,Where's the fun,"We bought Magic Rattle Pooh for our then 8 month old baby, cause it was so cute on TV. We were so disapointed. You shake the rattle and nothing. On TV the baby shook the rattle and pooh started to sing, doesnt work that way at all. You have to shake the rattle directly in front of Pooh, while holding him up. And still it isn't the same. What a waste of money."
2,save your money,I bought this toy for my son when he was about 6 months. It looked like a great toy for my son to interact with. First my son has maybe spent only about 4 hours with this toy and he is almost a year now. It has to be started by pushing on pooh's tummy and then is almost impossible to make it dance with a rattle. My son does however love the rattle but I could have gotten a rattle for a few dollars.
3,Makes good suggestions for professionalism,"This book is a great place to start if you don't know where to start. It gives helpful ideas for getting the word out, suggestions for professional looking resumes, and all the business promotion aspects that dancers need to know when getting started."
3,"nice, but not very deep","Well the title pretty much sums it up. Its a beautiful ash tray that holds 4 cigars/cigarettes. However, the bowl is very shallow. If your in a room with a fan/any wind, there will be ash on the table top."
1,Don't bother,"Dolphina's finger cymbal video is probably the worst I have ever seen. She doesn't actually teach you how to play. She teaches annoying phrases that you clang along to. This may make it seem easy at first, but when it comes time to actually play to music you will be lost. No instruction is given on musicality or rhythms. It's basically just for people who want to clang their cheap cymbals together and feel exotic. Maybe it would work for a quick Halloween persona. But don't expect to actually learn anything.If you are truly interested in learning finger cymbals I suggest these videos:-Killer Ziller: Belly Dance Finger Cymbals-Saroyan presents How To Play Finger Cymbals with Mesmera"
4,Much FUN for the learning toddler,"I bought this toy for my niece who loves Barney. It was just the right fit as it incorporates songs as well as colors and has colored song notes and colored keys so as your child gets older they can even play the music to there favorite songs. Itsy Bitsy Spider, Mary had a little lamb, and the I Love You song are her favorites. The ""pages"" are plastic and the toy in general is very durable. It also has a volume control, 2 levels - great for those days you need quiet!"
4,Too expense,"The toy was great, my son loves it but the site I brought it from sold everything too expense. I was shopping around I saw all of the items 50% less then what I brought for. Everything I saw was not on sale and when it was it was even cheaper."
5,Better than Hemingway's A Moveable Feast,"If you enjoyed A Moveable Feast then you will appreciate Callaghan's That Summer in Paris even more. Callaghan has a terrific writing style that makes for a painless and enjoyable read though it is definitely for the fan of the Paris in the twenties crowd. The book is filled with anecdotes pertaining to the great writers of the 20th Century such as Hemingway, Lewis, Fitzgerald, Joyce, Etc. Etc. Callaghan captures the darker and more fragile side of genius. Do yourself a favor and read this one, it'll stay with any true fan of the ""lost generation""."
2,"""Crunch"" bars dated until May 17 2012 gone soft August 2011","Bought four of these at Target and unfortunately used the receipt to get rid of some chewing gum -- have been buying them for years, and generally enjoy them. Will never buy in quantity again. They're all STALE. Not the first time I've noticed that happening much earlier than the sell by date, either. Caveat emptor (buyer beware)."
4,Needs greater depth,"I enjoyed this book, but it was not as detail as I would have liked. The portion on Pesach during the 2nd temple period was facinating."
5,A spiritual steak for the Christian believer,"Who is Jesus and why do we care?He is the Messiah of Israel, the Lamb of God who takes the sins of the world!Many Christians may know that John the Baptist introduced Jesus at the baptism as the Lamb of God and that Revelation calls Jesus the Lamb of God slain from the foundation of the world. But what does that really mean?The Rosens shift our perspective to understand the Jewish context of the Gospel... to remind us that Jesus is for the Jew first and saves the Gentile, too.The 'Jewish' feasts of Leviticus are call the 'feasts of the LORD' in the Scripture. These aren't just for the Jew. They are a picture of God's plan to redeem all mankind from Satan so that He can say to all believers in YHWH -- Jew and non-Jew -- 'You are my people and I am your God'."
2,Yet another one,"An interesting guide but not one that's honest. It does not reflect either the meaning of the Seder in Jesus' time or of the Passover seder as practiced today. For the Christian who wants a direct, more authentic description of what the service/meal contains and symbolizes, other books strike closer to the bone. One reviewer here directs people to a good translation of the basic pamphlet used at every Seder today. Personally, I look forward to reviewing the forthcoming ""Jewish Annotated New Testament"" from Oxford University Press.----------------------Update: oh, people don't like my review and think it is not helpful. Actually, I was direct."
1,I find more evidence of Buddha in Passover,"The authors with their backgrounds in Southern Baptist movement, share their warped values and fuzzyheaded logic to try to get Jews to convert to Christianity. The authors' claim to Orthodoxy is a lie."
2,theories and opinions -- not scripture,"Missler's book is based upon personal religious theories. Often, I think the author(s) take biblical scriptures out of context to prove their theories. Those theories seem to have some holes, in my opinion.I think this book is best for people who are really struggling with terrible tragedies in their lives, and looking for a way to explain why bad things happen to good people, but keep in mind that it is not the Bible; just a fellow christian's opinions."
4,A cool CD with big liner notes,"The music is fun - my kids (ages 3 and 1) love dancing and singing along (okay, only the 3 year old sings). The book is the song lyrics with interesting illustrations. So a little tough on the reader, in terms of hard to get in the rhythym of reading. And some of the song lyrics are a little odd in my opinion. But catchy tunes and cool pictures. Our favorite songs: Go!, Rollerblade to School, and I'll be an Airplane."
3,Comfortable but droopy,"First off, this is a very COMFORTABLE bra! I like that the pockets are located outside the cup rather than awkwardly inside. My only problem is that the pocket only allows the enhancement insert to be inserted under the breast. No matter which way I position my insert, the breast still appears droopy and awkward. Again, otherwise, a good bra."
4,Sweet and predictable,"I remember seeing this movie as the opening movie for a beach film at the drive-in way back when. I fell in love with Tommy Steele on sight. He plays a musician who is very shy and only overcomes it while singing at an orphanage. Of course the orphanage is going to be closed by the bad guys and enters a contest (singing) to try to win enough money to save it. He is of course very nervous and can't sing, but the kids show up to help him. There is a love interest also. Very sweet movie. I would love to own the DVD. I did purchase a PAL version from Amazon.com.UK and had it converted to NSTC. If you like Tommy Steele, get Finian's Rainbow or my favorite Half A Sixpence."
5,An insightful guide to corporate America,"This book is an insightful and interesting guide into corporate America and the evolution of jobs in this country. The author's insightful look into finding a job is very helpful, especially for those new to business careers. Going hand in hand are the author's tips for getting and keeping jobs, which are perfect for those seeking new careers. The author's passion for this topic is evident and the look into the workings of office politics is very good. Also, I thought it was good that he addressed recruiters and headhunters as well as pointing out that job-related print ads are a very small part of what's offered and that often the best jobs are never advertised. This book is well thought out, with a good easy-to-read structure and very thorough in content."
4,Excelent for the money,Toshiba laptops are screwed when it comes to cooling. Mine would stop several times a day. I tried several coolers from various stores and returned them all because they did not help. This cooler works for my laptops cooling configuration (probably will not work on all brands because the fan placement is different} and my laptop has not shut down even once since.
4,good for the price,"product is descent.it is a bit noisy, but does the job and isn't too distractingthe blue light glow is a nice featurethe tilt of the cooling pad allows your hands to type more easilyit is difficult to type with the cooling pad on your lap, so flexibility is limited"
2,it sound like a tank rolling after 3 months,When i first bought this. its good and quiet. It does cool the laptop well and the blue light is fantastic.Now its sound like a rolling tank.
4,Four Stars- Still the best,"This fan has two speeds, the blue lights which make it oh so superbly pretty to look at and has only one flaw. I discovered that the cord is too long and sometimes because of the length it gets accidentally jerked out of my usb plug turning it off. I have tried several of these fans and although i want them all to be larger this one is the best, I can use it in my lap, laying down, on a desk. The first thrill I had was when I plugged it in and with in minutes my laptop went from overly hot to a cold key supreme surprise. This is the best fan you can find on Amazon.com and I recommend it."
5,One of the best laptop coolers out there,"If you're planning to buy a cooler for your laptop, this is probably your best bet. Amazingly portability, contains an extra USB slot to replace the one being used, elevates your laptop for easier keyboard use, and has great cooling ability. Compared to those in stores, this is probably the cheapest and the most reliable cooler out there. On my old laptop, a $30 Targus cooler could only bring my laptop down 2 degrees. This cooler brought it down a great 10-15 degrees. I've already got 2, and would recommend this to anyone looking to buy a laptop cooler."
3,not for pavilion owners,"i have a HP zd,8200 pavilion,it exhausts hot air out the back, that air gets recirculated right into the fans on the cooler, which inturn goes right back into the laptop.this accually makes the laptop hotter when the cooler is on !!!..however i made a little shield out of cardboard that moves the exhaust away from the coolers intake fans and viola!!!it works awesome.... but looks a little hokey.....for someone without rear exhaust vents this thing would be perfect !!"
3,Not enough cooling for 17 inch laptop,"The fans seem to provide a good amount of cooling at a volume that isn't much louder than the fans on my laptop, but it just doesn't do the job for games like Oblivion. It keeps my it at decent temperatures for about 5 minutes, and then it just gets too hot. It may just be my Toshiba laptop though because I have tried a few different coolers and none seem adequate. I guess I have to keep using my desk fan."
5,best cooler out there,"I've tried the Bytecc, Targus and Quadcooler laptop coolers and this one is the best for portability and for performance (reducing harddisk temperature more than any of the others). Could definitely do without the crazy blue lights though!"
3,Works but it's not very stable,"I liked this product in that it did cool down my laptop. It cooled my core temp down by around 5 degrees (F). However, I have an HP that rocks slightly while sitting on this and thus I'm always worried about knocking it off. Next time I would go with a pad that sits entirely under the laptop."
3,eh...,"It's mediocre for an Asus A53s. It doesn't cool my laptop when it's idle, and keeps it 76 instead of 80 degrees on high when playing bfbc2. Maybe it's because this laptop has tiny vents. I could see how it could work for other laptops that have bigger vents at the bottom."
3,Math. . .ugh!,"I bought this book thinking it would help me with statistics, especially the book it is a companion for. I've since discovered that myself and math are like oil and water. I failed two courses in statistics and have come to realize those people who do well in it are of a special breed.I guess the book was good, but it did nothing for me.Jimmy"
4,Disco Gold,"The title ""Gold"" is very appropriate for this band, which set the stage for much of 1980's electronica, West Indian Euro-folk, techno, and disco.This music holds up surprisingly well, and some songs sound positively contemporary, even 25 years later.One of the best Boney M collections out there, better than the more recently released collection, which doesn't have as many songs."
2,Still waiting on a complete compilation from Boney M,"I'm not so happy with this compilation (although I agree with other reviewers that it does have a good coverage of songs). I only bought it because it had ""Kalimba de Luna"" (a very hard song to find at the time this compilation came out) but to my disappointment they had edited ""Ka Limba De Luna"" to make it shorter. This is the problem with buying compilation albums, you don't always get the full version of a song and of course the sound quality is often never as good as the original album (particularly if they equalize, remix or edit songs to fit with the other songs on the compilation album)."
2,this is not your best cd,you guys are a good band but this cd just isn't that great i like the chicken huntin song and a faw others i have about four of your cds and the others are really good but this cd makes me want to sell it to a blind kid in rubber gloves
3,this card iz pretty good,this card has its moments id say THE DOPEST SONG ICP EVER HAD C/H SLOUGHTER MIX I GOT THE SINGLE 2 is worth alone bying this it has a few good songs but some of em get old fast itz still dope though buy it ICP NINJA
3,"oh no, not old skool!","i picked this album up a couple months ago thinking i was going 2 luv it, well i was wrong, i mean, its not their worst but i just didn't like this album forsome reason"
5,#1 jokers card,"i'm a big ICP fan. out of all six joker cards this one was the best. the songs ""Chiken Huntin'"" and ""The Show Must Go On"" are awesome. even if your not a ICP fan you'll love it. it kicks ass! if you bye it you'll won't stop listening to this. The Riddle Box is wicked and the best!!!!!!!!!"
5,Who's going Chicken Huntin'!?,"Riddle Box is truly agreat CD by ICP, perhaps one of there best. This is the first jokers card I got and it has so far lived up to be my favorite. I find myself having songs from this CD stuck in my head quite often. Some of the best tracks on this CD are:Chicken Huntin' (Slaughter House Mix)Toy BoxCemetery Girl3 RingsHeadless BoogieDead Body ManI especially get a kick out of ICP's Redneck bashing in Chicken Huntin'. This CD makes me proud to be a Juggalo. So if you haven't got this CD yet and you like ICP just a little bit, GET IT!-GET DOWN WITH THE WICKED CLOWNS!-"
5,ICP KICKS *SS,Not their best CD (The Great Milenko takes that) but not disappointing at all. Their second best. All Juggalos should have this one
1,Too much stuff about mimes.,"It's a little known fact, but clowns really hate mimes. Most normal people don't know this, but Insane Clown Posse fans, or 'Juggaloes' (as they like to be called) keep this little-known code close to their heart. And when their favorite band doesn't shut up about it, how can you not remember it?What I'm trying to say is, this album is filled with too many tracks that just rant on and on about how ICP hates mimes. It's okay for the first couple of songs, but when each one of your 20 songs talks about nothing but hating mimes, then it gets a little tiring.Best songs: ""I hate mimes"", ""Attack of the mimes"", ""The war (on mimes)"", ""All Juggaloes should attack any mimes they see"", and ""Am I a nazi for hating mimes?""Worst songs: ""All mimes should go back to mimevillie"", ""If there was a movie on being a mime, then everyone would hate it"", ""Clowns vs. Mimes: The ultimate battle"", and ""Beat Down Those Mimes"""
2,Pure Stupidity,"I used to like ICP...in 3rd grade. If you are a smart person then you will know exactly what im talking about when you look at the title of my review. Now, i must give ICP props for starting up a whole new sub-genre, ""Horror Rap"", BUT, it's just hard for me to respect 2 wannabe-gangsta clowns. And im being literal when i say ""clowns"". I think the only male band that could pull off wearing make-up and not looking like complete homosexuals are KISS. This CD is just stupid. And that's why I listened to it when i was in 3rd grade. ""Chickin Huntin"" was the coolest song back then...the only reason i am giving this CD 2 stars is because i still think Chickin Huntin is kind of funny. Just kind of."
1,This Cd sucks,"It is so stupid, i mean come on they are all old and saggy and Yo wannabe's when will they get it, the reason that they are not famous is beause they arent good enough to make it in the real music world. Its just so sad. And what is all this crap with milenko and juggalo they dont even know what a juggalo is and violent j or whatever his name is i dont know what it is but how dumb is that. I think they might be intersecting instead of parrallel because to be a rapper you gotta talk bout girls which they are obviously bad at instead of talking about dead chickens and pig, and that is why i give it a one star raing."
5,I really like your cd the riddle box dead body man,"could you please send me a piture of the riddle box and your group piture PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE I love your songs. my address is P.O. 172 st.ignace Mi,49781 my name is brandon templeton"
5,The ICP album to get if you have a sick mind!,I really like this album...ICP may be deranged but who cares? They tell good stories and they are funny. I like a lot of their other stuff but this is THE cd to get if you want to hear ICP at their best.
1,Why must there be bad records? Buy better things here.,"There are far too many young people listening to this music who have not already heard the prerequisite James Brown's Funky People vol 1, 2. Public Enemy. Souls of Mischief. Pharcyde. DeLaSoul. Tribe Called Quest. Eric B and Rakim. DJ Red Alert. Wu-Tang Clan. Search Amazon for one of these other artists and buy a record from black rap artists and not white boys (apologies to Beastie Boys and 3rd Bass). Then there are Funk essentials also: Isaac Hayes. Curtis Mayfield. Barry White. mid 70s Marvin Gaye Temptations. Bootsy Collins. George Clinton. Funkadelic. Ohio Players. and more. Please do not buy any ICP records until you know the roots of the medium that they are trying to ""Pat Boone."""
1,I Love this Group,If you repeat these words you must suck worst then this.Come on heads diss this crap make it get 1 star they suck.
5,This cd is the bomb diggity!,"If you dont like this cd i hope you get killed by a drunk driver on christmas eve while driving to your house with presents for your stupid water head children. you need to get a lil somethin' somethin' and bust this piece in your cd player and punch your mother in her neck, that old bi--h dont now sh-- and you su-- all the di--s in your high school so you know shes gonna front. tell her to f--- off and lick your nu--z."
1,This is a poor excuse for music,"The Insane Posse, is just stupid. Their music is really dumb and annoying. The song Cemetery Girl sounds like it takes place in a frekin bowling alley. I wonder how anyone can listen to this and after 5 minutes not have enough of it. White rap by schitzophrenic 30 year olds (Or however old they are) who think that they are clowns is just really stupid."
5,wow,this is definetally one of the best cards-its got all the ICP attitude and its the halfway point to the 6th card
5,The 4th joker card beats the rest,This is the best icp album others might compare but cannot beat this one. The remix of chicken' huntin' is the best if you can get the single do it! I listen to this cd at least twice a day.
5,Best CD they've put out,"I am a long time fan of ICP, and i have 8 of their CDs. Out of all of them, this is my hands down favorite. The great thing about this CD is that all of the songs sound different, and they go together really well. My advice, if your looking to start listening to this band, start here, it made a fan out of me."
3,"A really good ""post-retirement"" album","First and foremost, this is NOT a mix-tape, and I have no idea why it's labeled as such. Also, if these are remixes, then where are the original tracks? Again, ignore all the ""mixtape"" stuff. Since Too Short came back from retirement, he's had a slew of BAD albums (most of which are nothing more than collaberations with other rappers). This is not that, although there's a few tracks where other rappers appear. Solid from start to finish, it's got a modern sound but still has that Too Short flavor. I highly suggest this cd, along with Get off The Stage as well."
2,BEWARE - this is NOT the original version! Songs are missing...,"I bought this package back when it first came out. I made the mistake of loaning it to one of my boys who never returned it. Of course he doesn't know if one of his boys clipped him for it - it's just M.I.A. So, I had to buy it again. It was hard to find when it first came out, so I was happy to find it on Amazon. The main song I wanted to replace was Six Figga Ni**as. This song is MISSING from this latest version of this package! I couldn't believe it. It is still listed on the liner notes, but just plain not on the damn disc. The liner notes list 19 cuts, but there are only 17 on the revised disc. I don't know if this has to do with royalties (Jigga, Lil Jon and a very wack Chyna White). All I know is that I just got jacked for my loot..."
4,"Gorgeous, meditative view of life in Antarctica","Beautifully shot documentary on the day-to-day life of a group of scientists in Antarctica. Very little in the way of narration, or an obvious organizing principal, this is more meditative, observational (and occasionally more meandering) than your usual documentary, But it somehow that style feels exactly right for the surrealistic majesty of the settings. Ms. Aghion is proving to be one of our more interesting and brave documentarians. (I'd urge those interested in documentaries to check out her series of 4 films about the aftermath of the genocide in Rwanda)."
2,so so storage,"Assembly was difficult because one part arrived bent and was difficult to bend back into its original shape.The storage would be much more useful if the width were increased by .5 inches because you can't put a manilla folder in flat though it will take normal 8.5 by 11 inch paper.In the end, this product did not meet my needs."
5,really does work,"This is the best tea that I have ever tried for stress. It is a part of my bedtime ritual. The hops gives it a little odd odor, but I can easily overlook it."
4,All Good Things,"All good things come in 3's -- so said a college physics professor of mine. He was obsessed with arcana of Isaac Newton's life and related conspiratorial goings-on, but the observation is a universal one. Johnny Carson frequently observed the magical rhythm of three -- setup, setup, punchline -- in the land of comedy. And now we have the Emberleys adding to the magical lore of Three. Read it and enjoy."
4,Solid first for B-Legit,"B-Legit the Savage's first solo album is a hit! many songs are G, my favorite being dank room. B-Legit, with his unique style and voice, is one of the bay area's finest. this cd is sure to be a classic."
5,Jive records ruined this masterpiece,"The actual Sic Wid it Records version of this album is an absolute masterpiece. B-Legit's best album, very raw. Jive made some changes to it and its just not the same."
4,Mobb beats,THis is a great album from b-legit. ITs has those tight bay area mobb style beats that sick wit it records used in the early days. You cant go wrong if you like bay area mobb beats.
3,don't get caught sleepin'...like me,"man, came across this cd yesterday...in a pawn shop hunting for old cd's. i'm sorry to say this is the 1st b-legit album i've ever bought. glad i did. haven't finished listening to the whole album, but so far.....man. don't pass this one up. i got the original version which has the ""F!@# and get up"" track that is missing from the version sold here. the original is on solar music group...not jive records."
5,Excellent production movie,"Full of information, nice graphic animations and scientific viewpoints. Darwin is a bust. Intelligent design is for people who want an open and truthful look at what are planet our ourselves are about. We purchased the two DVD set. I watch them on flights regularly. I am glad someone has taken the time to document the amazing stories about the detailed designs of our bodies and the cosmos."
5,Educational,I bought these DVDs sometime back. They are fantastic and very educational. I watch them every now and then to reinforce the information.
5,Privileged Planet and Unlocking,"This DVD set was full of facts and both were well researched. Although many would not agree with the conclusion, I think everyone would have to agree that the evidence used was accurate and not in question. Many people want this argument silenced but unfortunately the more I study the more I realize the ID argument has credence. Therefore it is necessary to have an open debate to increase our knowledge and at the very least strengthen the theories and knowledge that we accepted before all the evidence we now have was found. The cell was once thought to be simple it is not, the universe shouldn't be near as organized as it is. We need answers to these questions to expand our understanding of the beginning and order of things."
5,"Awesome, Who says God & Science are mutually exclusive ??","Very well done. Honest. Very illuminating and educational. While highly intellegent people are involved, they keep the information accessable.Based on Good Science.It is amazing how the Truth comes out so easily when we approach our Scientific Process with out presuppositions....Like follow the facts and see where they take you ?? Radical ??We highly recommend this. Watch The Privileged Planet first."
5,Cathy,Scientific explaination to creation that makes so much more logical sense that the junk science that is shoved down our children's and our own throats from Godless people.
5,Mom-2-2,My daughter recieved this for her second birthday. She was so excited to get the Barney play figures! She kept trying to climb in the tub to play! Now all of a sudden her older brother wants to play in the tub with her : )
2,Castle does not foam.,"This castle does not foam and the picture on the box is very misleading. If you continually pump the button, a small amount of foam will appear just above the bubble reservoir, but that's all, folks. Also, the pieces are all removable (read: you're going to lose them). My 3-yr-old played with this toy in the bath for an hour, so it does have some appeal, but the fact that it doesn't foam has me very aggravated. It's also ugly."
5,Awesome,"This CD is very good with some great songs not included in thier greatest hits package. Check it out, the songs (and very accurate portrails of life (#8)) grow on you.And by the way, the tracklist is 1. One Of These Nights 2. Too Many Hands 3. Hollywood Waltz 4. Journey Of The Sorcerer 5. Lyin' Eyes 6. Take It To The Limit 7. Visions 8. After The Thrill Is Gone 9. I Wish You Peace"
5,Track Listing,Side 11-One of These Nights2-Too Many Hands3-Hollywood Waltz4-Journey of the SorcererSide 21-Lyin' Eyes2-Take it to the Limit3-Visions4-After the Thrill is Gone5-I Wish You Peace
3,Take to the Limit***,Take to the Limit never gets old it will always have a hit you in the gut feel to the song.I have to say this is my favorite Eagles song.
1,One of These Nights,"This album is marked by the cool title track you've probably heard on the radio, but doesn't offer much more. ""Take it to the Limit"" is catchy as well, but the songwriting isn't that great on the rest. Kinda catchy, but mediocre. It has been an eye opener in a way though. Henley sings about loving a woman and all of her faults in ""Hollywood Waltz."" Before hearing this I always thought that men were the ones who have faults. Now I know better. ""Lyin' Eyes"" and ""After the Thrill is Gone"" are depressing, and I Wish You Peace is sappier than Bruce Johnston could ever do."
1,Very poor product,"I wouldn't recommend this unless you use distilled water. I have fair city water and within 2 weeks of using it, it is nearly worthless, even after soaking it in vinegar for 2 days to try to get it clean. There is no easy way to get at the heating element to really get any buildup off like in the model I just went to the store and bought. For those shopping around, I just picked up a Honeywell HWM-950 for $30 and am extremely happy with it. The heating element is readily accessible to provide very easy cleaning which should make it last a nice long time, plus it really puts out the steam on the high setting."
3,Pretty good for the price,"This is a very cheap humidifier, and it works reasonably well for the price. It has a couple of flaws though.The package said it would run for 12 hours or more on a full tank. A lot depends on how much salt you put in, and a tiny variation makes a pretty big difference in how fast it pumps out steam.Also, the guard that's there to prevent you from getting burned will keep you from getting blisters but it's still plenty hot if you stick your finger right up against the grill. A toddler could probably put their finger through the grill.Not bad for the price I guess."
2,Vaporizer does not meet needs,"The vaporizer was purchased to add moisture to the air in our bedroom so that my sinuses would not be so dry through the night and in the morning. I could not tell a difference. At first, we could see the steam, but that only lasted a couple of nights, even though we followed the instructions explicitly."
4,sasori saikou!,"To me, the most attractive part about this episode is the starring of of my all-time favorite actor, Tamura Masakazu. Trust me, his old movies and dramas are hard to find! (And he didn't have the dandy style yet!) He's still very young, probably in his late 20s or early 30s. He once said that he doesn't want to appear with guns on screen. But here, you see him shooting throughout the movie. Moreover, he's a young activist in the 1960s social moements. If you're a Tamura fan, you would definitely drool watching him tortured by the police! Sasori is cool as usual, and it's the first time I see her falling for a guy! If you're looking for gruesome and campy stuff, this one may disappoint you, cos it's definitely not as good as the earlier ones done by a different director. But it's a Sasori movie -- if you've watched the rest, there is no reason to miss this one."
1,AWFUL WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY,"I can't believe this got the attention of a publisher and that someone paid to have this short book produced. No one should bother to even pick up this book, though the cover is cute. Awful ancient advice is the only thing you'll find in this disappointing little booklet. Go to any parenting web site to find real information and advice. Don't let the cute cover fool you - and the same goes for the Dear Son book."
1,broken battery door,I have purchased 2 of these cameras from kodak and The battery door cover cracked on both in the same exact spot.It is very difficult to use now.I duct tape it shut but it usually does not work. I would NEVER EVER buy from Kodak again.
2,Battery Door Breaks EASILY,"I have purchased 2 of these cameras in a 1 yr range. BOTH cameras I paid more then 300 dollars for each one w/ the printer docks. The battery door broke on both. They take beautifull pictures but when you have to duct tape your camera it looks like crap and to send it to Kodak and pay 105.00 for a problem that is quit obviously a manufactures defect with these cameras, THEY should pay for it not me. I will never purchase another Kodak again. While it does take wonderfull pictures its of no use when after 6 months to a yr. of use the battery door breaks and you have to pay the company who made it wrong 105.00 dollars to fix it, it just isnt worth it in the long run.Purchase another brand."
4,Great Camera,This camera is so easy to use. Takes great pictures. I didnt give it 5 stars because I believe there is always room for improvment on everything. Kodak provides great customer service for those who can't properly read instructions (like me) and they dont make you feel like a dummy. We compared the pictures from the DX6340 to the Sony mavica(pictures had alot of yellow) and although close Kodak won (true in colors). Kodak DX6340 has so many great features and the software is easy to use. I highly recommend the Kodak Dx6340.
1,Second worst purchase of my life,"(The first worst was the Printer Dock 6000 to go with the unit)Within a week of purchasing this camera a year ago, the shutter stopped opening and closing... So, since it was within 30 days the point of purchase exchanged it for a new one. They said, no problem, they've seen a lot of that with this unit.Sooo it came as no surprise two weeks later when the shutter on the new unit stopped functioning.... And as the other reviewers say, Kodak warranty repairs are a joke.So, *everytime* we go to take a picture, we have to *manually* open and close the shutter -- that's right, pry it open with our fingers... Each time dirtying and scratching the lense a little more. I wish to heck we had never purchased this camera or the (nonfunctional) printer dock. Such a shame, we had a great experience with a previous Kodak digital camera. After this experience, I will never purchase another Kodak product as long as I live..."
1,What a Headache!,"I originally purchased this camera because I liked its features, price and read good reviews on Amazon.com. Now that I've had this camera for almost a year, it's been nothing but a huge headache. It sucks batteries like anything else. The rechargeable Ni-MH batteries I got from Kodak barely work at all (camera only takes 2-3 pictures before flashing a low battery sign) even after repeated chargings. Alkaline batteries are also completely useless. Be prepared to buy a lot of expensive lithium batteries. Just yesterday, the lens cover stopped closing, even with a brand new lithium battery. I've had it sent back to Kodak for repair a couple of months ago, and am now sending it back for repair a second time. Wish I'd never bought this camera!"
1,Bad Software Comes With This Camera,"I love the Kodak EasyShare cameras but I'm very unhappy with the software that comes with it. Kodak forces you into using their software as it's the only way to get the pictures out of the camera unless you use a drive for your SD card. Once inside the software, you can't rename picture files or save them to another folder. Neither can you select a group of pictures and copy or drag and drop them to another program. You can't even see the name of the picture file unless go to properties and then parse it out of an unfriendly name. The software was made to lock you into using ofoto to share/print your pictures. This software is extremely basic and suitable only for the beginning digital photo user or someone who only wants to print with the Kodak Camera dock. If you want to do anything more complex, buy another brand that doesn't lock you into their software."
3,Annoying switches,"Having to click past SIX modes to FINALLY reach the manual (PAS) mode really sucks.Why don't they use USB 2 instead of the extremely slow USB 1 mode to upload the pictures??Almost every time we go to use the camera in the automatic mode the flash activates!! I wish there was a way to shut the flash off and have it stay off (even when you turn the camera off and back on) until you want to use it.The digital zoom mode is really pathetic as far as photo quality goes. Our Sony Mavica FD-85 (1.2 MP)(2 years old and outdated) takes much cleaner and clearer pictures using the digital zoom.Battery life sucks - We like to keep ""Live view"" and ""Quick View"" turned ""on"" but this will empty the batteries in less than 50 pictures. Sure we could buy the ""optional"" L Ion re-chargable batteries but the above mentioned Sony came with them at no extra cost.We plan on returning ours to the Mart of Walls for a refund and purchase a Minolta Dimage Z1 instead."
1,"Takes good pictures, but you can't download to PC","As far as digital cameras go, this is a nice one from the picture taking perspective. However, given that it's very difficult to configure this camera for use with a Windows XP laptop computer, this camera should be avoided by the shopping public. The instructions are not clear, there is no support person to speak with (Kodak tells you it's a problem with Microsoft and thus not their issue), and now I've got a camera with 200+ pictures on it that I can't get transferred to a PC of any kind (what a waste!). OVERALL RATING: DON'T BUY THIS! Get some other vendor's camera (Fuji, Panasonic, Sony, anybody)!"
5,Easiest user interface of all digital cameras!,"Let's face it, I couldn't find a camera that didn't take decent pictures. I looked at the Olympus, the Sony, and briefly at several other models. The thing that sold me on the Kodak was the user interface and menu system. It is ten times easier to use than the Olympus that I was somewhat used to. If you want to take a close-up or you want to go into movie mode, you don't have to pull up the menu system, drill down through several options and switch into another mode, you just turn the camera on dial to a different setting.As far as downloading into your PC, I don't know how you could make it any easier? USB cable goes into USB ports and camera appears as a hard drive. With EasyDock system you can even eliminate the cable and recharge the batteries as well.Kodak named it well, this is by far the EASYiest camera to use."
1,only works for a year,"I was quite happy with this camera for about a year. Then, had similar problems as others-- battery door broke so the camera constantly shuts itself off (I've been trying to keep it shut with tape) and the shutter doesn't completely open or close, sometimes staying shut even when turned on. Basically, it's useless after a year, so not worth the money at all."
5,Great Camera For Anyone,"I bought this camera after extensive searching online for the right one for me. This camera is extremely easy to use. More memory is a must for it, 128 is plenty, and also rechargeable batteries because it goes through alkalines in about 10 pictures. Overall this is a great camera for the money and I recommend it to anyone."
1,Great - but only when it works,"When I first bought the DX6340 last summer, I found the camera easy to use and I was pleased with the picture quality. But as time went by, I have found that actually taking pictures with this camera hasn't been easy. Its been in for repairs two times - and had two CPU's and circuit boards replaced. Its heading in for its third repair this week. Within days of it arriving home from the repair shop, it has stopped working again. Its incredibly infuriating because I've lost holiday and birthday photos which I can't replace. They look great on the LCD, but after they're downloaded its evident that the photos are horribly distorted. Alternatively, the camera stops allowing me to download pictures entirely. Its a shame since I've had great success with Kodak products in the past. Recommendation - avoid this camera like the plague."
4,Lens Fails to Retract,"When I first started using this camera, it was wonderful, however, after about two weeks of use, the lens failed to retract, renduring the camera nonfunctional. I called Kodak Customer Service, was treated horribly, and they told me that the problem was the battery, that I needed to recharge it, which I had just got finished doing. Needless to say, I must return the camera now, losing with it, the pictures that I had stored on the internal memory. This is a great camera if you don't happen to get a defective one."
1,Don't purchase!!!! Waste of $$$...Broken Battery door,"I have this camera, as well as the CX7300 model. As the other reviews have stated, it's a great camera...until the battery door breaks. I had this camera for just about year when the door cracked. It worked for a little while after that with duct tape, but that doesn't even work anymore. Then shortly after it happened to the other model. I think it is a shame that Kodak made these wrong and will not repair them for free. May I recommend the Canon A550 or A560. Don't waste your money on this one or any other Kodak camera."
2,"Don't buy it, my review is just like the others.","Okay, this camera takes okay pictures. Landscapes are a little blury, zooming sucks.. but the battery door broke just like everyone else says.I try to tape it shut and then the tape peals off and my camera shuts off.Not to mention the fact that Alkaline batteries last about 10 minutes tops on this camera. Very frustrating.And the rechargeable batteries? Yeah, it won't recharge. And I only recharged it twice using that battery.Don't buy it. Even if it's used."
4,Pretty Nice Camera,"I really like the 4x optical zoom compared to my old 1.5 zoom camera which was a Kodak also. It is one of the smaller sized camera with some weight, but I like the weight. I like the fact that you do not have to worry about a lens cap and that it is built right into the lens. The dail feature is a little annoying, but normally you just would click once clock wise or counter clock wise.Pictures come out great and so do the movies. I have no complaints yet. I hope it last long.Good Luck"
2,"Great in ideal conditions, poor in low light, and it broke","Overall I liked the camera, except that it took exceptionally dark pictures in medium-to-low light conditions, and the night mode is useless.The zoom is great, given how rare it is to find a 4x zoom even in newer cameras.Picture preview and deletion is handy, except that the joystick in a little touchy, sometimes hard to handle without clicking down while navigating.Now it is broken - it immediately turns off after it turns on, even with new batteries. Apparently this happens to a lot of Kodak cameras - I'll never buy another Kodak after this one."
4,A camera of value and excellence,"I bought this camera a month ago and I _love_ it. It is very easy to use, with well-designed buttons and menu. Its 4x Schneider len is impressive considering the price of the camera. Its 1.8 inch LCD not only is larger than many other cameras, but also has higher resolution. The camera does not have an option to change image compression level. But Kodak probably has chosen the optimal level for general use and you probably will choose the same level if you are given the option. The EasyShare software is easy to use. And the trasfer of photos/videos from camera to PC is extremely easy. But without care, the software can make duplicate entries. The camera came with a scratch on the body, which is the reason I remove a star."
5,Kodak DX6340,"Just got mine at a great price form Amazon. I'd read all the reviews, most of which were excellent, but be assured that this is a super camera with all the bells and whistles you'd ever want. There was some concern in other reviews about software but I have experienced no problems and the camera and dock are communicating fine with my PC (450Mz 98se). The photos are fab and the video clips are great fun. I use Irfanview to resize, etc., and all is well. Fantastic product.. if you're in 2 minds just buy it! The battery cover is a bit weak but that's the only gripe so far. Go get yours!"
4,"Good entry level digital camera, but night mode is terrible","I like the camera overall - you get good zoom, it is light enough (without either the fit-in-pocket feel or sticker shock of sub-compacts), its user interface is intuitive, its reviewing features are great, it offers the capability to take super short movies with sound if the muse strikes you. The controls are mostly automatic, which is good for a beginning digital camera enthusiast. There are several different modes of operation - I find the sports mode useful when taking pictures from a moving car.But here is the bad news - if you want to take night time pictures, this camera is terrible. I have missed out capturing some very camera-worthy moments at night when the photos have come out really bad. The trouble is the slightest shake ruins the night time picture."
3,Pretty good once it got moving,I had a really hard time getting into this book. I thought that the beginning was kind of boring. The book picked up though after Katy's accident and from then on it was really intresting. I liked the way Katy changed and grew up.
5,Favorite childhood book,"My grandmother gave me this book when I was a child and I have loved it ever since. Beautiful tale told in a realistic, heart-warming way."
4,"If you are a Book-lover, (and are a girl), Read This","I liked this book a lot, but in the end, I'm always rather dissapointed at Katy's new demeaner. Obviously, she wasn't bad before, she just had energy. Defintaly read the others, such as ""What Katy Did at School"", and the one about Katy traveling through Europe, the title of which I've forgotten. Anyway, Katy's new attitude is rather boring and timid, but Rose, of ""What Katy Did at School"", is a wonderful character, so I highly reccomend this series."
4,nostalgic indulgence,"I think 40 years must have passed since I last read What Katy Did. As a child I read it several times, and although not tall like Katy, in many other ways, being the eldest, a bit of a story teller, and often trying so hard to be good but often failing, I felt I WAS Katy. Reading it now as an adult I can see the strong moral overtones that underlay the story... virtues of patience, tolerance and kindness, that I half realised were in the story, but as a young reader, I think I glossed over in my race to see what would happen to Katy.I would not recommend this to any younger readers who have not developed reading stamina, but there are still some romantic young souls out there who will also fall under Katy's spell. For adults out there who want to revisit Katy... do it, it may surprise you how much you have forgotten!"
5,Great book... Fun for anyone over fifth grade,"I LOVED this book. No really I couldn't set it down. The first in the series of books about the Carr family this book was an enduring reminder of the love that one can build for themselves even with some type of handicap. The charicatures are so realistic that at times they seem to jump out of the page at you. Anyone can relate to this story and make conections between themselves and loved ones to this book.The reading level is about right for anyone in the fifth grade to adulthood. In truth although I am far beyond that grade, I found the book to be quite satisfying and without many flaws"
5,"Amazing! I don't know how they do it. But, they always work to...","dissuade our local Wolf Spiders from hanging out in our homes. Went from seeing 5-6 of these jumping, fast, huge, scary, twig looking creatures a day to zero within a few days of plugging them in. The trick may be in having the right amount per square footage. Not sure. But theyve always met our needs."
3,"""Risky behaviors""?","I had an earlier version of this.After closing off old rat holes, no more tried to chew NEW holes.Previously,One poor fella was in the passageway by the back door: the machine seemed to make it too scared to move, but I propped the back door open and he ran out.As for insects seeming to LIKE the machines?...""risky behaviors"" seem to be popular among young humans.So what if the noise ""disrupts social organization, reproductive behavior,feeding patterns"" etc?..haven't we seen this before?!Heck those ""constantly changing frequencies and pitch"" are probably the most exciting thing they have ever heard...hmm, THEY probably call it ""music"" too."
1,My cats hate it!!!,Sorry to say this is not good for pets like it says. My poor two cats as soon as I plugged them in they went running to a room that did not have them and would not come out. Please do not get if you have cats.
1,Roaches love it,"Don't waste your money -- the roaches sit ON the device (yes, it's plugged in). Ants crawl right past it. I haven't seen any flying monkeys in the kitchen, so maybe it works for them (but wait . . . I've never seen flying monkeys in the kitchen . . . hmmm)."
1,"The little red power indicator light works, but that's it.",Have had these for a couple years and haven't noticed a decrease in spiders or any other pests. In fact just today I noticed a spider had made its home beneath one.
1,I wanted to give it a chance,"I bought a similar model also released by Black & Decker from Walgreens recently. While I had my doubts as well as having read the handful of negative reviews here on Amazon I took the risk and bought it anyway. Long story short, three days after I installed the units in my apartment I still saw cockroaches crawling around. They didn't seem to be phased at all by the units. I returned the units yesterday and bought Combat roach motels instead... at least those I know work."
2,Arrived Broken,"Only one of the two actually worked, because it arrived in the package broken... However in saying that the one that does work is going good."
2,"maybe, maybe not","These are ""silent"" to the human ear, and there is no volume control. just the LED indicator, so one really can't tell if they're working, let alone repelling pests. I still saw mice four days after I plugged them in. Caveat emptor."
5,AMAZING product!!!!!!!,"I bought this a couple years ago & it's the best thing I could have done. Before I bought these plugs I had bad bug problems in my bedroom. At one point my room was infested with flying ants and centipedes. I would find a spider every week. Now, 2 years later, I barely see more than 1 spider a month and haven't seen a centipede in several months. I'm completely terrified of most bugs so this product has been a godsend."
2,Not for use in apartments,"Do not waste you time and money if you live in an apartment building. This product was ineffective in those areas.Black & Decker EX410-2P-TP1 Ultrasonic Pest Repeller, Medium Room"
4,Haier Dehumidifier Does a Fine Job,"The Haier HDN455E 45-pint dehumidifier performs well. It works at low temperatures, is quiet, and keeps the basement nice and dry. I'd give it five stars, but it takes a while to figure out how to empty the bucket without spilling (it was designed for looks and not function). However, now that I've figured out an acceptable way to dump the water, I'm satisfied with this unit's performance."
1,Stopped working after 1 year,"Worked very well till it lasted. Then, it stopped working - wouldn't turn on. The stupid thing has no power LED; it has 2 other LEDs, one comes on when it is working. So, you can't figure out what could be wrong. Checked water tank trip, and also tried changing the settings - no help. Very poor quality."
4,"Worked continuously for about 3 years, then died.","Bought this product about 3 years ago. Ran most of the time in our basement (about 1,500 sqf) throughout the year with continuous drain and kept the humidity very effectively below 65%. Having had no problems throughout these 3 years, but a couple of days ago the unit died. For the price and longevity, good deal."
1,Buyer Beware,"product did not work from day one. phoned seller, cant help me, i have to call the manufacturer. called the mfg. on hold for 1 1/2 hrs, no response, left msg after being prompted to do so by their voicemail, suppose to get back to me in 48 hrs. Still waiting, 1 month later, tried the same thing again to no avail. these people are not good to do business with."
1,stopped working after one season,"After hooking this up in my basement, and using the hose attachment, it worked fine; however, a year later, the machine shuts itself off when full in spite of fact that I have the hose connection on. They put the hole for the hose way on the top rather than on the bottom where it should be. I had a very savy handyman look at it and he too couldn't figure out why the hole was on the top, nor how to get the water to drain through the hose. I am now shopping for a new brand."
3,Great while it lasted...,"The Haier HDN455 45-Pint Capacity dehumidifier was the right price, capacity, and features for what I needed in a humid room where I'm temporarily storing furniture. And it worked great, while it lasted (almost a full month). I don't know what happened to it, but it's basically electrically dead for no apparent reason. So far I've called their answering service, explored their website, and sent an email to their customer service. Nothing. No listed service centers and no responses in the past week. It looks grim."
5,"Great durable unit, 2 years so far and still going","I bought this on clearance a couple of years ago to repalce my well aged unit which i inherated from my grandmother circa 1973 or so. This unit so far has been nice, doing a good job even in the humid midwest summers. Caution though, this is the first unit I have had that has an Air Filter on the intake area, just remember to clean it a couple of times a year. I had not done so till midway through this summer, and it significantly cuts down on the efficiency of the unit if it is left dirty. I notice a drop in the output air temp and the machine was not working as hard. My mom has had 2 prior dehumidifier units of different brands, one died after 10 years, the second only 4, but neither had a filter. My brother has a different model from Haier that doesn't have a filter as well, so plugging up isn't as much an issue. But, so far, great unit, sucks the moisture right out."
1,Horrible!,"I am completely disappointed with my purchase. I received the product and it does not work. The ""full"" light is on (the light that comes on when the dehumidifier tray is full and needs to be emptied) at all times, even when the water tray is empty. Therefore, the dehumidifier will not turn on because it ""thinks"" it has a full water tray. I am currently calling numerous places to see if I can get it fixed and find out if there is a warranty. What a pain!!"
4,Basic dehumidifier,"This dehumidifier was purchased as a cheap dehumidifier for a damp basement. The noise level was just about what our old dehumidifier gave us, IE you knew it was there, but it was not obtrusive. It has a connection for an external hose and just sits in the corner, turning itself on and off based on the humidity level in the basement. This is a basic appliance performing a basic job well, for a basic price. I would recommend this dehumidifier."
1,1 year again,"In the middle of my second summer (about 15 months after purchase) it just died. It seems like an electrical problem in one of the circuit boards. I'm looking for parts to replace it, but this thing is quite loud for its small size. The other problem I have is the cycle time. It would come on and run for a minute and then shut off and do it again. I knew the thing would break based on that."
2,only lasted 3 years / easy control knob,"We used our Haier HDN455 in a finished basement to protect a piano. We liked that it had a mechanical knob to turn it down or off while playing -it was not as quiet as our older dehumidifiers but it did not overheat the space and wasn't as noisy as the other new model we returned. However after 3 years of use at the normal setting with the fan on low, it has completely stopped working and won't even light up. There is a 5 year warranty on the compressor, but it costs $150 - $250 to replace a compressor according to the service people that Haier referred us to, and who knows if the compressor is the problem. In fairness we had forgotten there was a removable filter to clean, but the two previous dehumidifiers that lasted about 15 years each in the same situation didn't even have filters. So we are going to look for a different brand, preferably one that contains more environmentally friendly refrigerant such as Danby or Bionaire."
1,chinese junk,"Worked great the first year, started it up the second season would not work customer service is a joke, repair parts are hard to come by, etc. If you have one or buy one good luck"
3,One out of two is not bad?,First unit arrived and the compressor turned on once but not again. So the fan would run continuously. Amazon was great at taking it back and sending a replacement right away. The second one seems to be working fine. Lets hope it continues to do its job through the long hot Florida summer. I bought this unit to replace a 2 year old unit that died just out of its warrantee period.
2,Good while it lasted,"I bought this unit about 18 mos. ago. Sometime in the last several months, it died. Not sure when it gasped its last breath, but it is now DOA. Completely dead. My experience seems consistent with those of other buyers. Might want to avoid this unit."
5,A nice looking Dehumidifier that works as advertised,"This is a good product so far. A good dehumidifier that does the job in my basement. It is quiet, not noisy, like some reviewers stated also there is very little vibration I connected the drain hose and let it drain into a floor drain. The hose does not leak if connected properly.It has a rather odd connection. The washer that seals the drain hose is part of the drain hose, it has a collar on it and must be slipped over the connection on the humidifier. Read the directions.The humidifier does a good job of removing water from the air. It automatcly shut off after about eight hours of running after the first time I plugged it into the electric outlet and now it cycles on and off when needed. The musty smell in my basement has entirely disappeared.I would buy this unit again.I rate it 5 stars"
1,Are you deaf?,"If you are deaf then this dehumidifier is for you! Otherwise, it sounds like a train is going through your basement. Okay, that is an overstatement, but seriously, way too noisy, even in the basement, as it is easier to hear upstairs. Also, the bucket full light is constantly coming on, even though I have the drainage spout hooked up."
4,Great Price Works Well,"I bought this dehumidifier for $169. We built a new house and did not run the Venmar (ventialtion system in the garage) because the house is so well insulated, the garage sweats during the winter only. Our garage is 32ftx32ft. As a result, mold was starting to grow on the walls. The Haier does a wonderful job of sucking all of the moisture out. We don't have a moisture problem any longer. The only minor complaint I have is the tray in which the water accumulates in is a little hard to slide in and out. Other than that minor inconvienence, it's been a great product."
4,works great,This was fairly easy to set up and use. We are using the drain hose and after looking at the directions and looking at the materials we figured out how to connect it. The directions were not helpful at all.
1,poor quality/design,"No mention in product information that fan is always on, even when target humidity level is reached. Second issue which I'm not sure is a design defect or mfg QC issue involves auto-defrost feature. I suspect auto-defrost uses heating element to control ice build up, but that heating element is always on by design or defect, Haier CSR couldn't tell me for sure. The result is when not dehumidifying this unit blows enough warm air to heat up my small basement by a few degrees. Not exactly my idea of a ""high-efficiency Energy-Star dehumidifier"". This unit is going back for a full refund."
2,Haier HDN455,Worked well for a little over a year in a basement. Now it cycles on and off but does not pull any moisture out of the air. Pretty expensive to only get about a year's worth of use. Atleast the Whirlpool that it replaced went for two years
2,Dead after two years,"Ours lasted exactly two years and two months. I guess we fared better than some. When it worked it worked great, but needless to say, we'll be shopping for another brand this time."
4,Good but noisy,Dehumidifier works very well. I'm using the included hose setup and running right to a drain but you should be aware that this is very noisy even on low speed fan. Its in my unfinished basement so not such a big deal for me but could not use in a part of the house and watch t.v. comfortably.
3,So far so good but.......,"I will say that so far, so good with this model. It is no louder than any other dehumidifier I have had and it works easily enough. Our cellar is much drier now. My only complaint of note is that when I unpacked it, I noticed that the outer skins were not aligned and I needed to disassemble the unit partially to get everything to line up. Seeing how closely they don't seem to watch their quality in China, I am keeping a close eye on it. This kind of sloppy manufacturing wouldn't have happened if it was made in the USA."
4,Great for general pathology board review,"I love this book and I have to admit that I have never really enjoyed cytology. There are so many illustrations and examples however, that I found this book to be great for my board review. One caveat though, is that the book is a bit out of date regarding the Bethesda grading system for GYN cytology and some of the terminology is also a bit dated. Yet this didn't stop me from finding the book to be very helpful for reviewing cytology. I read it cover to cover with particular attention to the many nice pictures just before the general board examinations."
3,"Nice book, pretty pictures but...","Dave, if you lived there for so long, you could have at least made the publisher get the name right! It is Lees Ferry, no apostrophe. And it is some of the best fly fishing on the face of the planet as far as I'm concerned. Marble Canyon & the Vermillion Cliffs at dusk is absolutely magical. Good book on a great place and a wonderful sport!Oh, and I think that Dave will agree that guide I use, Bill McBurney, is another top notch guide for the area. Either one you go with, Dave or Bill, you are going to have a great time fishing!"
2,Good book to take with you on your roadtrip,This book suggests a lot of collecting places. Many are on BLM land (Bureau of Land Management)and there have been recent changes in who is allowed in. A lot of desert areas are hike in only now.So update your info. before you turn in on that rutted unpaved road.
4,Rockhounding California,"This small book presents a great deal of information that can be helpful to the reader searching for locations and facts about minerals and gems. Using the instructions i was able to find the locations on Google Earth even though the book did not give give coordinates. the instructions are well written and clear. in only a few instances did I find ambiguous directions.For some materials it is the only description of the source, something very sadly missing for many purchases."
4,Good,I been three of the spots in the book. All three I have found a lot for rock. I just wish that there wish more nor cal spots in the book. Maybe they shound make two books for California one for north the south.
5,"Bravo! Adventure, suspense and travels w/ a little boat!","Quite an adventure and adventure story! Stephen Ladd's writing is clear, easy to follow, interesting, and well broken into narrative, dialogue, insight, and poetry. Ladd pulls no punches when it comes to detail, whether describing dangers, beauty, or his own personal state of mind and opinions.Highly recommended for anyone who loves adventure, boating, or has ever travelled or will ever consider solo travel into potential danger."
4,Nice realistic cruising story,It was nice to read a sailing story where the captain talked about the fear he felt from being in poor conditions in a sub optimum boat. Good story of travel. Guy is a little bit on the creepy uncle/ dirty old man category as a person.
1,Waste of time,Although some may be able to use the route information dontbother with the rest of the book. A shallow account in everyrespect. The author embodies the ugly american taking advantageof people everywhere he goes. More an account of keeping tohis mileage/travel schedule than the people of the countriesbeing visited. Part of the travel through SA is at nightpresumably for security but then what is the point of beingthere? Don't waste your time.
2,self indugent blather,"I have read most sailing travelogues out there, and this is without a doubt the most annoying, self indulgent blather I have encountered yet. The most amazing thing about this journey is that the author survived at all. Where does bravery end and stupidity begin? Its like reading a badly written diary. Women will be offended by the authors sophmoric accounts of his ""romances,"" others will just find it tedious. For a much better read of a similar topic, try A J Mackinnon's ""The Unlikely Voyage of Jack de Crow."""
1,In no way a classic sailing nor adventure story,"This Guy confuses falling in love with prostitute sex. He does not even know before he goes anything about where he is going; no charts, no boat registration, no understanding of legal aspect of moving himself and his boat in the areas he plans to go - and this was after a YEAR of planning.He believes he needs the protection of a gun.. Hmm - and then that gun had better have the most deadly bullets in the world.He writes (terrible) poetry all the time and constantly adds statements that I assume he feels will impress.This guy's text is unsophisticated, and abbrasive. But he had an incredible journey.Definately not a girl friendly book. If you are a beer swilling guy that likes the ladies (whatever they cost) you will probably find this book a great read. Much more a book about Steven Ladd, than about sailing, or even the areas he visits."
5,this stuff lasts forever,I use this to keep my tool rest waxed. It provides a smooth but not slippery film that my gouges and skew chisels glide along when I'm turning. Occasionally I'll wax the shanks if I have too much wax on the rag. I've also experimented with it as a wax finish and it gave a great shine to the pecan. It's a great value because it on takes a little dab to get the results I'm looking for. I'll probably use this same tub for 5+ years at the rate I'm going.
2,Not as great as advertised,"Have tried this product and so far I am not impressed. This is not a product that is supposed to be used on tool rests or power equipment tables as a previous reviewer suggested and actually many tradesmen have used floor paste wax for that with excellent results. This product is supposed to be used directly on the tool for cutting metal; whether that is steel, stainless steel, aluminum, etc. It worked okay but you really do have to apply after every cut, regardless of the process. No lubricant works best for all applications and materials, but in comparison Cut-Ease Stick Lubricant generally performs better."
4,Everything you ever wanted to know about Unicode,This book is basically a manual for Unicode 3.0. It is not a light read but well worth the price and then some just for the glyphs from all of the various scripts that Unicode supports.At 1040 large (8.5 x 11) pages it is the ultimate guide to unicode. With information on scripts and glyphs I had no idea even existed.However if you are just getting started with Unicode I would recomend you get Unicode a Primer written by Tony Graham from M&T books. If you understand or feel you are starting to understand Unicode then The Unicode Standard Version 3.0 is the best comprehensive reference on the subject out today.
2,overly sappy,"I admired the setting and overall plot but it got very dull and boring. I was als getting fed up with the drawn out mushy parts. Also, I am a Christian and admire stories with Christian themes but this was getting on my nerves that just about every part in the story had a moral and Christian meaning. I love morals and Christian lessons but sometimes enough is enough."
2,Repetitive Angst,"The idea behind this book was good and held promise. However, the writing was absolutely pretty bad. The author should win a medal for saying, ""I've loved him for 10 years; what do I do now that he has returned?"" 100 different ways. That was, basically, the first half of the book. The second half was the guy saying, ""I've loved her for 10 years and I'm not going to lose her."" 100 different ways. Throw in the same sermon said 100 different ways and you have this book in a nutshell. The angst, worry, and drama emoted by each character would make a 14 year old proud. There wasn't even redemption in the ending. The author had a good idea here, but her delivery needs a lot of work."
2,Nothing special,"I picked up this book, excited to find another christian romance series from an author I had never read before. About halfway into the book, I realized why. The writing in this book is probably something similar to the books I wrote when I was thirteen. The plot was rushed and pointless, the ""christian"" characters were fake and unrealistic, and the romance? I can't stand stories of unrequited love when suddenly a light bulb clicks - ""Oh, she's so pretty and smart and wonderful. Why didn't I see it before? I must be in love!"" THAT is the epitome of forced, and I'm not exaggerating one bit. I did finish reading the book, but at the expense of a wasted afternoon. The story idea had promise, but lacked a better writer. I now have another author I know to avoid."
2,Surprisingly below average,"I found the setting of the Alaskan village very interesting. Descriptions of the dwelling(inne), food, and clothing also interesting. However, the first few chapters that I suffered through were poorly written and lacked emotional depth. The story did not flow and is under developed. The characters are not believable. It did not capture my interest beyond the setting of Alaska. I was so annoyed with the bad writing that I had to stop reading. I do not recommend this book."
4,Alaska Adventure,This was an excellent second book in the series. My only complaint is that she left you dangling and the third book will not be out until this fall.
1,"Couldn't get past the ""God"" references","I was looking forward to reading this book - my sister lives in Alaska and I love to visit her and read about it. But I couldn't get past the way too frequent references to God, and I'm Catholic! I was ""trying to read this"" on my Kindle, I think I made it 5%, He is mentioned at least once per page....As a full-time working mom with 4 year old twins, I don't gte much time to read, so I am probably not even going to bother with the rest of the book! The time I get to read is too precious to spend on something I can't get into."
1,A Huge and Tedious Disappointment,This is the most boring book I have read on my kindle. The storyline dragged. The characters were almost silly. The ending was unreal. Yuck.
4,better than I expected,"I was hesitant to read this from other reviews, but found it was much better than I expected. I have found that many kindle freebies are poorly written or too over the top in their Christian proselytizing, and must be carefully chosen. This proved an exception to that generalization and was an enjoyable read that I would recommend for purchase although probably not at a full 9.99 pricetag. I would characterize this as much a historical fiction as a Christian fiction as I learned about a time and place in Alaskan history rarely written about. I found the interaction between the missionaries and natives interesting and believable. The challenges facing residents during the winter months and the mystery in the story kept me reading."
4,Good Read!,"I was wondering if Tracie would go on about the lives of the too young people in the yukon quest series. This story takes place about 20 years later and leah and jacob still find themselves in Alaska, of course we know that there will be action and adventure mixed with romance. Its a good read, but i think you will enjoy it more if you read the yukon quest first. For me it was more exciting because i knew there past."
2,updated - one year later,"Well built(at first). My daughter and her friends use the lounger all the time in our pool. I am ordering 2 more!Update: after a year, all three loungers are coming apart."
1,No Warranty,"I received 2 of the items and when I tried to inflate one of them I found that the foot part was not sealed at the seam. Since the product had been opened I called the manufacturer and was told that they no longer make that same model number so there was nothing that they could do because it was a model that was discontinued. They are however still making the same siesta lounge, but have given it a different model number. I did e-mail Sportsstuff and told them how unhappy I was that they do not stand behind their products and that I had owned a siesta lounge before and it lasted a long time and we had really enjoyed it but would not be buying any of their products again since they do not stand behind them and also did not like the mesh seat which in the previous one was canvas. So I would not recommend this to anyone even though one of them was fine."
5,Product was as advertised,I decided to buy this product based on the mostly favorable reviews and I wasn't disappointed. It is a very solid lounger. The extended back gives enough support to allow me to sit up comfortably and read a book. I like the fact that the cup holders are actually large enough to hold a glass rather then just a can. For those of you planning to use the product in a pool I would recommend taking it out of the water when not in use. The chlorine used in pools will eventually cause the fabric covering to weaken and deteriorate. That may have been the problem with one reviewer who said the product fell apart after one year of use.
5,Float Away,"I purchased this lounge from another source, but I could not resist sharing. We just got it today. I am a large man and was in question how it would work for me. I blew it up and was impressed with it from the beginning. I got in it with the seat folded in to begin with. It sat comfortably. Then I put the footrest out and although took a little effort to get in position I floated with confort and in a good position to get a tan. My legs were out of the water and although the seat is mesh I was held up out of the water adequately. I would suggest this product to anyone looking at this type of float. I would note I was standing on pool steps to get on the float."
3,"Great tube, but leaked after a relatively short period of time.","I have mixed feelings on this tube because the layout and features of it are perfect, but it started leaking air far earlier than I ever would have expected. I have only used a Coleman rechargeable air pump that is not particularly powerful (but necessary given the size and layout of the air valves). Main bladder was leaking enough air to require a refill each morning during my camping trip and it never felt fully inflated. I am going try and find the leak in a pool in the near future and attempt to patch it as needed, but for the price I would have expected it to be a bit more durable. That being said, it's great to have the option to sit sprawled out in the mesh netting if the water's warm and it's nice and sunny or flip up the foot rest if it's a bit cooler. Two cup holders and coolers are great for the dedicated beer lounger."
1,Help. I'm sinking,"Bought two of these as they looked pretty much like a great floater Sevylor used to make, but discontinued. These are very difficult to fill with air, unless you have a very special pump and adapter - which is not provided and not mentioned when you purchase. The main air fill hole is over an inch in diameter, thus making it difficult to fill with a regular air hose hooked up to an air compressor. I jury rigged a device and was able to get it blown up without the special adapter. The problem now is that they both leak air and must be blown up on a daily basis. Other than that, the design is great and it is the best pool floater design I have ever come across. If only they didn't leak air! BTW, the Sevylor floaters are still in use and work GREAT. I just wanted to add to my fleet - but I wasn't looking for submarines!"
4,Perfect for rafting multiple together! High Quality canvas.,"Have used this at our beachhouse and purchased it because several neighbors had same model. I have had sportstuff floats in the past which lasted 3 years (that's good for constant use on salt water and dragging over a beach). But for some reason, bought a less expensive blue model this year (still not cheap) so mine wouldn't be exact. Learned quickly - if it ain't broke, dont fix it! We're on salt water, have kids dragging over oyster shells and over bulkheads. It is comfortable, sturdy canvas protects the vinyl, has two drink holders (important for us) and the best part it is the only one I found that has hands on both arm rests which are essential for rafting multiple together. Totally worth the money - would not pay more for it though. Wish it would go on sale from time to time but so far have always had to pay full price! LOVE THEM!"
2,Chairs don't last & SportsStuff does'nt stand behind their product!,These chairs don't last. I have 2 with the same problems. Mesh is coming away from the nylon cover AND we have repaired SEVERAL leaks in both chairs. Most of the leaks are in the seat/footrest. Contacted SportsStuff... I was contacted by Greg who was RUDE. He told me they don't have any in stock right now. (but they are selling them on their website. Stating also that they are in stock)He said IF they had them he would SELL me one. Never buying anything made by them again!! Their products are too expensive for them not to stand behind them.
5,Nothing Else Like it!,"I purchased a bunch of new pool floats. The order included one of these. This was the only item which impressed be (and anyone else who has tried it).I was disappointed to see that it was made in China, and the gauge of the cover and pvc inflatable part were not as heavy duty as a towable (which I was expecting), but it is designed for pool use - not being dragged behind a speed boat.It is well made, extremely well designed and it attracts a lot of attention.I find it comfortable in both positions, and so does my wife, kids and friends.I'm going to order another one for my Mom (for her birthday), and I might get another one for myself - so there is less fighting over it at my house...So in a word ""Recommended"""
5,Top Quality!,"Very good quality product. Material very tough and sturdy- takes a beating from kids jumping around on it! The Sportsstuff Siesta Lounge is very roomy, great for a larger person. Mesh seating is nice for keeping a little cool in the water while floating, or fold up footrest to keep your bum dry and just dangle your feet. Cup holders and storage area are nice. Overall, a great product!"
1,BEWARE,BEWARE...This lounge would be PERFECT if it was build in better quality. Was used it VERY gently for no more than an hour for the first time (in our outdoor pool) and it tore at the seams where the cushion folds. For as much money as it was purchased for I feel it should be more durable.
5,Perfect river float!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is a perfect river float. Strong and very comfortable. Everyone will envy you and want it!!!! This is the only way to float the river, I will never float a tire again or approve anyone using a tire.Three different inflation holes, so you can make the float as firm or soft as you want where you want it!!!!! The neck, body and feet"
5,Sportstuff Siesta Lounge - Great item.,Great float at a great price. This is the second time I have purchases this lounger. I bought the first two 8 years ago and they were so good I went back for 2 more!
5,Continuing the Siesta,"We owned two of the earlier versions of this Siesta Lounge. We have had them for years and they were GREAT! They are probably about 6-8 years old, maybe older, and they were finally wearing out. Prior to ordering this new version, I thought I would buy one like it from a local sports store, it was uncomfortable, cramped, and poor quality so I returned it. I found this online and since it was simply a newer version of what we already had, I knew it would be exactly what I wanted. We love these, we use them regularly in the lake throughout the summer, they are comfortable and roomy. I highly recommend avoiding the look-alikes and just buy this one, you can't go wrong."
3,This arrived stuffed in a small box.,"This was stuffed in a box about 9"" cubed, stuffed with Styrofoam ""peanuts"". I couldn't imagine there was a plant in there, but there was. It was very twisted. I would be surprised if this straightens out, let alone survives."
4,plant in very good shape,The plant was shipped very carefully and it is in very good shape and very healthy. I am getting more branches coming up and it is grwoing very well. I cann't wait to see it blooming in spring.Thanks
2,Jasmin plant,I love jasmin plants and flowers but this one NEVER bloomed so far. I'm really disapoinment.
1,took too long and one plant short..,"I ordered six plants, and paid $56 for the two day shipping. That took about 10 days. There were only 5 plants in the box, and I wouldn't really even call them plants. They were tiny stems with a few leaves on them.Very disappointed in this seller."
1,Much smaller than looks in the picture!,"These plants came and they were small and weak looking. The shipping cost me more than the plants and so each plant cost me over $10 each. I feel for the price, they should have been bigger and more robust plants."
1,Not up to his original book --- There are more helpful books,"I found value in the author's first book: ""Selling to VITO"" but I've been disappointed with his books since then. It seems that subsequent to his first book he has spent his time learning to market books rather than focusing on writing great books.""Value Forward Selling,"" by Paul DiModica is the book to buy if you are wanting help selling up the food chain."
3,3 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Many fans of the series hate this movie, but I was just relieved to see it try something different--it's not really a very good film, but at least it tells a story that isn't the exact same thing as Rocky III and IV."
3,Decent film but new Rocky is a better bookend,"Unlike a lot of reviewers, I won't totally trash Rocky V. It actually had a decent story but there was just something that it lacked in terms of trying to be the final Rocky.Certain parts in the film actually are pretty good but they just don't go together very well. While none of the sequels equal the original Rocky (with the exception of Rocky Balboa), all of them seem to have a flow to them that this one kind of lacked. In fact, when I view this film, I rarely look at the whole thing. Most of the time, I forward it to the end with the streetfight which is probably the best part in the whole film! If you notice, the new Rocky barely mentions Rocky V except for the phrase ""Home Team"" when he was talking to his son! That's how lowly regarded this film is.I can only recommend this film to die-hard Rocky fans or to those that want the whole story. Otherwise, I'd say skip this one and get the new one along with the first four films."
3,Rocky V (1990),"This was an alright movie. Rocky gets bankrupted and takes over Mickey's gym. He moves back to the streets were he meets Tommy Gun, and trains Tommy to become the champ.This was a good movie, but not as good as the other four."
4,"Not Memorable, But Still Very Likable","I think this was the only Rocky film I never saw at the theater. I guess I'd had enough by then. However, I did catch this on VHS and, despite all the negative opinions I had read concerning it, I was glad I saw it. It was typical Rocky entertainment: hokey but satisfying and generally enjoyable.Richard Gant did a nice job impersonating Don King and Tommy Morrison, a real-life fighter, turned out to be a pretty good actor. Again, we see the familiar characters, namely ""Rocky,"" his wife ""Adrian"" (Talia Shire) and ""Paulie"" (Burt Young), Rocky slob-friend.The final scene provides the usual over-done fight but, if you've seen the others and enjoyed them, then you should like this, too. It may be the least memorable of the Rocky series, but it was still fun to watch."
3,Not that bad,"Yes compared the others in the series this movie falls short, however, that doesn't make it a horrible movie. It is a decent Drama especially compared to a lot of recent movies. Rocky is still a likable character. Tommy Morrison (Tommy 'Machine' Gunn) and Richard Gant (Duke) play their roles as bad guys well.Some of the problems of the movie include the music soundtrack which has not aged very well. Old school rap really doesn't fit into a Rocky movie. The plot is also very predictable.If you have not seen this movie in a while, I recommend watching it again with an open mind. It was years since I saw it last and I liked it a lot better now. Best quote from the movie: ""Adrian, I can't wait to get you upstairs and violate you like a parking meter."" -RockyIts hard not to laugh at a line like that."
5,What the #@%$!!!!!!,"so, out comes a great pic with a different twist and everybody got a bug up their flabby out of shape keester that this one is so terrible, and they all are bad since ROCKY!??? This (#5) is the first one i bought! Great story and great example of what goes round comes round. It shows that some people don't need to be in the ring and center of attraction to be (-come) a true champ. Rock On, Italian Stallion!!! The saga is great from start to finish, look forward to enjoying ONE thru SIX for years to come! Nuff said!"
1,worst rocky movie,this movie is only good for like 10 minutes. when he street fights at the end. the rest of it is boring. i think they should have stoped at 4. i heard they are think of doing a rocky 6 where is works in youth center. i think its time to hang up the gloves on these movies. let 1-4 be classic and not make any more
1,No eye of the tiger here!!!,"A bum and a country bumpkin. Definitely not worth watching! This was just flat out bad acting.The movie picks up where it left off in 4, in Russia. Wasn't little Rocky a chubby 7-yr-old redhead in IV? Anyway, Rocky comes back to America and was greeted by little Rocky, who was all of a sudden 12 and had black hair.I am a huge fan of 1-4, but 5 doesn't deliver."
1,"I, II, III AND IV WERE GREAT, BUT THIS ONE WAS PITIFUL!",This was the worst Rocky movie of the whole series. The plot was really stupid. They should have stopped at IV.
2,Enough Already!,"This one takes the ultimate fall from the silly tree and hits every branch. The only thing I liked about this was the return to the familiar Philadelphia inner-city setting. This film was shot on the same location as the exellent ROCKY I and its as if they are trodding on sacred ground. The sequels of II, III, and IV were at least watchable and entertaining with II being the best of the sequels, but this one is not worth the time. There is an interesting sequence as the ending credits roll and the Elton John song ""Measure of a Man"" plays on the soundtrack(we are treated to a series of B&W photos of all 5 films in a chronological order) while assuring us that this is, indeed, THE END."
1,wrong DVD delivered,"I have waited for the holiday to come to watch the Rocky V with my son. Therefore, it wasn't until yesterday I opened up the DVD box to watch it. Then I found out it was wrong movie. Something like ""The Witches"" and ""The never ending story"" were in the box. It was quite ironic. I hope this was just accidental wrapping mistake."
3,Rocky 5,"I thought this film was quite good. In this film Rocky loses everything money, health only to go back to where he used to live where he meets and agrees to train a young boxer Tommy The Machine Gunn(Tommy Morrison) who Rocky finds out does not have his heart. Morrison is great as the boxer who takes Rocky on as his manager and then dumps him for a flamboyant promotor. The final street fight where Gunn knocks out Polly and challenges Balboa to a fight is very good."
4,Rocky V,It is a great movie about when Rocky gets older and still has the ability to fight in the ring. He is a success in the restuarnt business also.
2,Down But Not Entirely Out,"Well-intentioned yet hopelessly contrived, ""Rocky V"" (1990) earns a few points by avoiding the comic-book slickness of ""Rocky IV."" Unfortunately, Sylvester Stallone does a poor job establishing the Italian Stallion's bittersweet decline. The climactic street brawl works, but the family-oriented narrative goes in too many directions. At least ""Rocky V"" paved the way for a triumphant finale with ""Rocky Balboa."""
2,Rocky Balboa vs. Reality,"This final? entry in the Rocky series is yet another further decline from the Oscar winning first entry in the series. Rocky is retired and Mick and Apollo are both dead. Tommy Gunn, a real life pro boxer becomes the new face of boxing and Rocky is passe. The appearance of Don King in this film makes me wonder if the real life boxing industry was going after the Rocky series for some reason. Not worth seeing unless you were really moved like myself by the first film. Rocky and Tommy Gunn duke it out in a street fight."
2,The worst of the six Rocky movies,"This movie didn't suck but it wasn't a great movie either. The main thing that hurt it was the street fight. When people went to see the Rocky movies, they expected to see prizefights. Not a street fight. At the beginning of each Rocky movie (except for the first and sixth one) it showed the ending of the fight he had in the previous movie. Why wasn't the ending of the street fight shown in Rocky Balboa? It was obviously not shown because the street fight was pathetic.Another thing that hurt this movie was that Rocky lost all of his money. Many fans hated this. This movie is worth watching but it is obviously the worst of the six Rocky movies."
2,"NICE TRY, BUT STILL THE WORST OF THE SERIES! 2 1/2 STARS!","I own the older box set with the first 5 Rocky films included in it. I wanted to write reviews for the individual films. This review is for the film and the older release DVD.I have to give Stallone credit for trying to go somewhere new with the series, but this film just has too many clichés to keep it from being very good. Stallone's real life son is a terrible actor and is one of the reasons this film is the worst in the series. Overall the formula keeps you watching and the film is entertaining if you don't think about it too long.The DVD transfer on my edition is OK, but there is room for improvement.*** ADDED NOTE ***The worst film in this series is kind of unclear, as part's 4 or 5 could be viewed as the worst installment. While both films are entertaining, they are the least in the Rocky franchise. This point was brought to my attention by an Amazon buddy!Thank You Stan!"
3,A must for Rocky fans...other's Eh!,"IMHO, Sylvester's WORST acting skills are shown here. However, the storyline is GREAT! Tommy Gunn was excellently cast and, shockingly, I really, really liked Paulie in this one. Talia Shire did a great job too. The ONLY think I hate with ALL the Rocky's (from 3 on) is the fact that they re-cast his son in all of them with each one worse than the prior one. They are way too different looking as well."
3,Rocky V,I have enjoyed the complete Rocky series ever since they have come out in the theaters. Very pleased with this DVD.
2,"UNFORTUNATELY, THIS IS A SIGN THAT THE ROCKY SERIES HAS DIED","DUE T0 BAD BUSINESS DECISIONS BY PAULIE, WHO'S ADRIAN'S BROTHER, ROCKY ENDS UP BROKE AND HAVING TO MOVE BACK TO HIS OLD NEIGHBORHOOD. MEANWHILE, ROCKY TRAINS A YOUNG FIGHTER. THE CAST DOES THE BEST THEY CAN, BUT, UNFORTUNATELY, THIS IS THE WORST MOVIE OF THE SERIES. THE ONLY THING THAT'S REALLY WORTH SEEING IS THE STREET FIGHT AT THE END. OTHERWISE, THIS IS JUST A BORING MOVIE. TAKE MY ADVISE, THIS SERIES IS DEAD. THERE'S REALLY NOTHING LEFT TO DO WITH THESE MOVIES."
2,What happened to the Rocky saga?,"This film has stained the Rocky name and brought our hero down to his knees in shame.In this movie,Rocky Balboa has suffered brain damage at the hands of Ivan Drago in IV,and is forced to retire from the ring.Just when the Italian Stallion is forced to give up his dream,along comes Tommy Gunn,an oafish,yet deadly fighter that Rocky agrees to train.Shunting his wife and son aside to train Tommy,a corrupted fight promoter takes over Tommy's fighting schedule and convinces Tommy that he will never be recognized if he doesn't defeat Rocky.It all leads to a blowout in some street as rocky and Tommy each throw punches and decide who is the real champ.The storyline was awful,Rocky was not the fighter he used to be,and the fight did not take place in the ring.Don't buy this film."
2,Rocky V,"Overall it was okay, SLY tried to end it well, but Rocky VI was alot better ending of the saga... But every single Rocky 1-6 Rocked...."
1,Really Bad Movie Dont Watch,This Movie is really bad. I watched it once and just about threw up. The way Rocky changes from a sophisticated person to a bum like the first movie is stupid. I didnt think money made people talk different and all of a sudden have an education. The only time I would watch this movie is never.
1,Rocky fights cavities,"What a horrible movie. Come on, this really puts Rocky in a bad light. Even Stallone looks bored in this one.Stick with the origninal Rocky"
3,A very good movie but....,Here are the good things and bad things:GOOD:* Amazing acting!!!* The relationship between Rocky and Tommy Gunn was cool.* Rocky's son is Stallone's real son.* Rocky is still the champion even if he doesn't fight again.BAD:* WAY TO EDUCATIVE!!!!!!!!! Rocky spend more time with Tommy than his son and money means nothing. (Must of the movie is like this).* Rocky lose his money for a stupid reason!* I dind't understand why Tommy had to betrayed Rocky.* The colors of the movie SUCKS!!! (Rocky 4 have the best budgets)* HORRIBLE fight choreoghraphy and Rap music at the end!* The final fight was in the streets.P.S: The director Jonh G. Avildsen always srew up the sequels. (Let's not forget Karate Kid part 3).ADIOS!!!
1,Pass on this unless you can just borrow it.,"First let me say, I took Alexander lessons and they have made a wonderful difference in not just my riding but also my health. Unfortunately this book will not give you the information to apply Alexander techniques to your riding, depite the author's attempt to explain what Alexander is about."
3,"Great Book, but too wordy","I am using this book in my studies in Anatomy and Physiology class in college. The book is well written, but too long and wordy. It does explain things well, but it's impossible to study from for tests."
4,An Excellent Resource,"Marieb's book was an excellent resource in my A&P course this past semester. The diagrams, figures and drawings used in the text are very detailed, thorough and very helpful in understanding the material. I loved the integration that she used in the book. I also greatly enjoyed the sections that are included in each chapter about diseases in different systems and the case studies at the end of each chapter. It really helped to keep me interested, motivated and kept me actively learning the information, not just memorizing it to quickly forget it later! This book has helped to make this class an awesome adventure."
5,This is a great book for anatomy and physiology students,"I used this book in my college anatomy and physiology classes. It's a well-written book that I could understand the first time reading each page. In other words, you don't have to keep looking back or reading each sentence over and over again before you can understand it like in some other books. This books is easy to understand and gets to the point and is presented in a very organized matter.However, I also used Anatomy and Physiology Study Guide: Key Review Questions and Answer with Explanations by Patrick Leonardi(Vol 1) and (Vol 2)(ISBN: 0971999619) (ISBN:0971999627) also sold on amazon.com. These two books helped me study for the same type of questions that were on my exams. I got a ""A"" in Anat& Phys 1 and 2 with these 3 books. The textbook gives a great foundation of knowledge and the study guides showed me the kind of questions that most A and P teachers ask on tests."
3,review updated!,"Marieb is obviously interested in patient care and that focus remains throughout the book. The ""chatty"" style is at times unclear. Later editions of this book are more clearly organized graphically. However, as a transcriptionist in training, I was horrified to find in both the CD-ROM that came with the book, and, more egregiously, in its online modules, amazing errors, misspellings, and misleading terminology. My personal favorites were, for metacarpophalangeal joints, ""metacrapophalangeal joints,"" and for ligaments, ""ligemants."" But there are many more. I write this because I've contacted them SIX times and nothing has been done, over a 5-month period, to correct it. Enough said.DECEMBER 2003 UPDATEafter my 6 attempts at contact, i finally heard from the publisher. the online modules have been updated; i have checked them and they are much improved. hooray."
3,A good overall analysis of the Human body,"I love this book. It's a great overall analyis of the Human body. The words and concepts are comprehensive. The only exception is the diagram. Some of the diagrams are hard to follow. It's best to have another book go with it. The diagrams are not really clear, can be on the confusing side. Other than that, I would definitely recommend the book. The workbook is very helpful."
4,Excellent anatomy book for Beginners,"I took a course to test how i will perform in anatomy and physiology for med school program. We had 4th edition text as our main book through out the course. I am very much pleased with the book, specially the topics on CNS, PNS, and related to nervous system, as it covers lots of neuroanatomy, which is very helpful during med school program. However, Marieb must come up with a new consize book like Essentials of Clinicaly oriented anatomy by Moore. That would be great help for med school students, who love more than class notes. I would rate this book 4th edition as 4 out of 5"
1,Never received Book,"Unfortunately, the book was never received from the third party. They said they mailed it but it never came to my house or back to theirs. Therefore my review of the book doesn't exist and my review of the sender is poor."
3,Disappointed,"The whole album is not in the league of Farewell Transmission. I've tried to warm up to the other songs, but it's not working.Farewell Transmission alone is worth the $16 I paid for this album, but that does not change the fact that the rest of the songs are a) not even in the same league, and b) not in the same vein musically or atmospherically.Sounds like a bad Neil Young cover band at times.I will continue to listen in the hopes that I have a change of heart, but as of now, you can count meDisappointed in Baltimore"
3,markers,I thought these would be thinner in the body than they are. It is fatter than a regular sharpie and takes some getting used to. But they work well and last a long time. I have only used 2 of them so far drom the case and I have had it for over a year!
4,Appearances are Important,"This lengthy, but well-written book provides splendid examples in support of the authors' theses. Another reviewer has provided a very good summary and I can only add my hearty recommendation."
2,Cute Set -- But the Quality is not the best,"When I saw this item on Amazon, I thought how very cute it was. It is cute but the quality of most of the items in the set leaves a lot to be desired. It is very overpriced for the quality. One of the shoes fell apart about five minutes after our granddaughter (age 4) wore it -- the little tutu began losing the sequin flowers about two days after receiving it. Very disappointing to realize that I overpaid for this set. I contacted Amazon and they said they are Sorry -- so am I!!!"
2,Cute but cheap,"I bought this for my 5 year old. Within an hour of opening the package one of the straps on the wings broke, the elastic on the tutu broke and the crown came apart. The shoes broke a couple days later."
2,Are they trying to tick off collectors?,"The quality of the episodes of this set are decent (but consists of about 50% filler) and is why this gets 2 stars. The main problem with this box set is the cost cutting efforts of making the box set without a decrease in the cost. The first four in the shippuden series had each disc in its own mini case. Starting with the 5th box set they have changed to a compact 3 discs in one standard sized DVD container design. ...But hey, I've always been threatened by change."
3,filler,"fist off this box set is a filler. not only is it a filler,but it has all of three of the dvds cramped in a small case.on top of all that it ends before the main battle starts. the box set begins with narutos training. then the rest of the box set is a filler about sora. its not bad for a filler box set,but it ends without finishing it. so that means its gonna be on the next box set as well. the reason why i cant give it one star is that the battle scenes it has are actually pretty good,and its quite funny."
3,Lacking,"The story arc is decent enough, but lacking in over all enjoyment. The box set also ends at a point where it would ""just be getting interesting."" This seems more like an optional story arc then any true meaning to the series."
5,Edge of America,Good movie. Just goes to show what one person or a nation could learn if they just took the time to. Was an eye opener for me.
4,Great Movie for High School Girl's Basketball teams!,"The actors, basketball scenes was an open window into the lives of Native American people on one reservation. It touches on the realities of racisim toward one's culture, skin color and gender. I got my 14 year old daughter to watch it and she enjoyed it in spite of her rejection of basketball as her sport."
3,Good Film,"Good film. Good message. It has some real moments of vision and beauty. It has a valuable message - it doesn't have the depth that it could - but, it's along the lines of ""Coach Carter"" - without the punch. It's worth owning and watching, however. Issues of racism, etc. Tolerance, forgiveness - good stuff."
5,Excellent Pen,"For a few years now I have used a fountain pen as my primary pen at work and every where else.But then I received one of these free in a office supply shipment and I immediately fell in love. It's a guilty love and I still use my fountain pen outside of work but in the office I remain faithful to this guy.Honestly, I didn't even know I was using a micro point until I went to reorder them. I usually perfer a medium point. This pen writes incredibly smooth and leaves a nice bold (but not fat) line. And the added benefit of being acid free and that it's not easily ""washed"" by a forger is icing on the cake for me.It has a nice comfortable grip and my hand does not fatigue easily when I use it. They are sold in smaller quantities here and elsewhere if you don't want to commit to a 12-count box. But I would definitely encourage others to try this pen out."
1,wrong thing received,"I ordered black ink pens and they sent me red ink pens. Thanks a lot guys. On a positive note, the useless red pens got here pretty quickly."
2,Eccles Bus Book,"Lots of facts and production info. Reads like a series of VW mag articles (i.e.- lightweight) Many great color photos, but too many of the more interesting ones are postage-stamp size! The author had a pretty good thing going here, but at only 95 pages, came up about 15 pages short of a really good VW Bus book! To his credit, there are no pages wasted on chopped, lowered, hand painted or ""Cal-Look"" bullis!There are a few better VW bus books avail....before you'll need to buy this one."
4,Very valuable technical resource,"I have found this book to very helpful when deciphering the various details (m-codes) and specifications of numerous VW buses. The quality of the book (pictures, text, paper, manufacturing) are top notch. It has lots of good information and interesting photos I have never seen before. Everytime I pick it up it feels like a new book. I just ordered a second copy for myself."
1,The Sleeping Tiger.,"This DVD isn't an original copy, the quality image it's quite bad. Sadly I made the mistake of purchasing this."
2,"Good reference, horrible text book","This book is definitely not well suited for use in a college engineering course. It is simply much too terse and does not present key concepts or ideas efficiently. I did myself a favor and bought Linear System Theory and Design by Chi-Tsong Chen, which is actually a surprisingly readable book. This book is not readable as a text book, I would recommend using it only as a reference."
2,"Poor brush, poor service","Brush was delivered promptly, hence the 2 stars. One cleaning and this brush fell apart - 7-8 wire bristles came clean off the brush. Another half a dozen wire bristles are barely hanging on - making the brush look like a Hallooween witch's hair-do. Sent an enquiry plus pictures of the brush to the seller through amazon 5 days ago, have not heard back one way or the other. Disappointed with both the product and the level of customer service."
5,Family Friendly Funny Fun that Rocks,"The show was fast paced and well written.The focus was on the multiple facets of being a teenager within a high school context.I believe each character represented a different facet of what it is to be a teenager.It was a pleasure to watch a show where the context was not centered on the intimacies of human sexuality.The character development focused on the frailty of youth with dialogue that was free from salacious sexual innuendo and cheap double entendres. Well done MR. DAN SCHNEIDER...Finally,without singling out any one special performer (ELIZABETH GILLIES) these youthful actors Ariana Grande...Leon Thomas III...Matt Bennett...Avan Jogia....Daniella Monet...Michael Eric Reid and of course Victorius Justice are going to be heard from again and again."
4,"Sublime, but try the import version first","No matter how you package this incredible album, it will always shine. This has a few perks that the original does not have, such as Change We Must and a great 5 minute Vangelis intro to Wisdom Chain. It is a must for all completists, but if you are only getting one Page of Life, you need the import version which has 4 other incredible songs strangely not on the American release. Vangelis himself was very upset that this version was ever released. Some of the songs were remixed and do sound different from the originals, but, to be fair to Jon Anderson, it still is a masterpiece of an album. The song Page of Life must be one of the most beautiful songs ever written. Change We must and Garden of Senses are so inspirational and uplifting. It is hard to listen to this album and not feel more relaxed and inspired. I suggest buying both versions, you really can't lose."
3,Not their best,"This is the last of 4 albums by this duo, and it suffers from that early 90's sound - also, it's just not as fun or unique as their previous works. It does have it's moments though, and any Jon Anderson fan will appreciate it."
4,Very simple introduction,"This book is not a college book on relativity. it is written for curious mind who wants to know something about the relativity and author gives a very layman introduction to it.It starts with space-time concept of Aristotelian, Galilean view and than slowly enters into relativistic view. A lot of space has been delegated to definition and explanation of the concept of Iterval and than jumps into physical meaning of the concepts. It is only as the author says from A to B and no more."
5,The American Eric Ambler,"One of the finest American writers of the late 20th Century. Thomas has a near perfect ear, and a dark and wry wit."
3,Bamboozled...,"Bamboozled by the New Yorker quote on the jacket, I expected something quite special from this book. Turns out it's a par for the course spy/international intrigue novel about competing interests pursuing a vigilante killer of culpable Nazis in post WWII Germany. Its distinguishing feature is the protagonist's foil, a likable but untrustworthy Romanian dwarf (there's only one dwarf in the book, the first seven are a reference to Snow White's) who is usually a serious character but also provides occasional comic relief. The book held my interest, however I found the ending weak. This stems, I think, from the supporting characters not being sufficiently well developed for me to accept their motivations - well, Le Carre it aint."
2,Not enough basics,"I read this book based on the great reviews and was dissapointed. My main concern was that although there was a lot of information in the book about supplements and other related diets, they basics of how to start and keep a low carb diet were broken down into one paragraph. There wasn't even a list of foods considered high carb vs. low carb, or guidelines on how long to eat a certain level of carbs before (maybe) increasing them. There are a lot of reviews of medical studies, but the basic how-to's seemed very limited. I'm looking at a few other books now to get more step by step instructions."
3,"Okay, but a little on the excessive side","I am new to low-carb dieting, and have resisted because of all of the hype. Decided to give sensible low-carb a try, and wanted a book with some, duh, sensible advice. The guidance is pretty good, some good sources for low-carb foods, but over the edge in some regards. ""Practical"" advice for dining out - ask for a sample of the food you're thinking of ordering, chew it up, spit it on a special stick, and if the sugar is too high, ask for something else. This is the kind of guidance you'd give to people who might die if a sugar gram accidentally passes their lips, not to those who want to get some pounds off their butt (and actually keep their friends around). The author also subscribes to a whole array of products to take to stave off those accidental carbs. This book wasn't as much practical guidance to me as it was just another over-the-edge book, but this time written by a ""regular"" person, not a doctor hawking his latest program."
2,This book is problematic,"On one page the author suggests canola oil as a good source of omega 3s, then just two pages later she cautions against canola oil as being overly refined. This makes me doubt her attention to detail and the rest of her advice. Further, she mocks people with peanut allergies as the ""peanut police,"" clearly not understanding (nor having bothered to research before commenting) the nature of severe peanut allergy. The issue on planes isn't accidental ingestion. For the severely allergic, being on a plane with recirculated air while surrounded by 50 or more people simultaneously opening bags of peanuts is a guaranteed emergency landing with a trip to the hospital. Anyway, the above makes me doubt the quality of the information in this book"
2,missing episodes,"This set is incomplete. Not because it doesn't include Vampire Knights Guilty as stated in other reviews, but because episodes 5 through 8 were not in the box. We received 1 disc with episodes 1 through 4 and another with episodes 9 through 13. That was it. Where is the disc for the missing episodes? It was definitely missing from our order. My daughter loved the episodes we got, but it was a bit difficult to figure out what was going on when she went from episode 4 to episode 9."
4,Is it dubbed??,"The language says that it's just in Japanese with English/Japanese subtitles? Did Amazon forget to put English in the Language part or what?Other than that I LOVE Vampire Knight, and I'm glad someone finally dubbed the anime. :D"
5,Addictive,"Originally this show was watched on an anime streaming site online with English subtitles. and though i LOATHE subtitles, i watched it anyway. Boy was i impressed...i couldn't stop watching...i have since purchased both this series and the second series, Vampire Knight Guilty. I am impatiently awaiting their arrival at my doorstep! A very riveting and addictive anime!"
2,About the version here,"The series is fine. You can read a review of that else where. This is feedback about this version.1) The voice actors were miscast. They tried, but the original feel of the series is severely compromised. Halfway through I went back to the Japanese version with subtitles.2) The audio is sloppy. It varies from place to place in the recording and is too soft in places, too loud in others.3) There is no translation of Japanese text in the english version without the subtitles. I guess that even though they realize we all don't speak Japanese, we're all supposed to be able to READ it.4) For a ""box"" set, the quality is very poor.Frankly, I would try and get a hold of a fan sub version. It's better than this."
5,I don't usually write a review...,"However, this anime was amazing. From the opening music to the closing music. Everything about it screams gothic and the music really puts you into the mood with what the anime is all about: darkness, romance and secrets. I don't usually write a review...I think this is my first one actually, I just had to say this is an amazing anime. It took be my the neck(;D) the first episode and I was hooked. I bought this and just finished it right now...let's just say I already bought all next season already :) I love Zero (even more so since the man who dubs his voice is the main character from the anime AIR TV, which I recommend as well.)Can't wait to find out what happens next...I hope Zero ends up with Yuki. >w<!!!<3"
3,"Good, but it ends not even half way through story","The animation and voice acting were great, but as a fan of the manga the anime cuts off way too soon in the story. The manga continues on way past where the anime ends bringing in some realy great plot twists. I was very disappointed that it didn't continue on, if you're like me and a fan of the manga you probably won't like the anime because of that."
3,In a world of Vampires and love triangles....,Yuki Cross a naive young girl lives at Cross Academy with her step father who is principal. The school has two classes: Day and the night class. The day class consists of your average run of the mill high school students while the night class.. yes you guessed ti is for vampires! Yuki and her friend/ companion as a guardian of the school Zero keep the day and night classes in check. This is our basic plot of course a love triangle has to be made: Yuki loves both the night class and pure blood vampire Kaname Kuran and also has feelings for Zero. Vampire Knight is a typical Twilight like shojo romance except with this series it at least is bearable. I absolutely loved Zero he's my favorite and in my opinion the most likable character. The best things about Vampire Knight are the art and the music the openings and endings are amazing. So watch a vampire romance without loosing brain cells and enjoy the anime Vampire Knight.
5,Live for the night,"Great series. If you love anime and vampires this where you should be. Romance, drama, action and comedy all rolled into one! Well worth watching"
5,Love It,"I had seen these before but had to read subtitles, so when they came out in english i knew i had to get them lol very good!"
1,"NOT ""Complete Series""","Just because they call the second season of this series ""Vampire Knights Guilty"" doesn't mean they will fool everyone into believing that 12 of the 24 episodes of Vampire Knights qualifies as the complete series.I got excited when it seemed I would get the full 24 episodes of the series so quickly (late January) but it is all deception. Instead they've given a subtitle to the second season and are calling it another series entirely.Lame."
4,vertical limit,"This story is about a family that likes to climb moutains. The main charecters are Annie and Peter Garret and their father. They are out climing in Utah in the moutains. There are two amatures that are falling down the moutain and crached on the ground laying there motionless. This made the Garret family move quickly and slipe to the side of the moutain. The rope could not hold that much weight so the father made his son, Peter, cut the rope to save him and his sister's life. His sister blamed him for the death of their father's death. This was the best action book that I have ever read. If you like action books this is a book for you to read."
2,Vintage was Better,I was really looking forward to receiving this book. I had received the Workbasket when I was learning how to knit and crochet and I have many fond memories of it. I am very unhappy with the book. The vintage patterns are reworked for the book and in many cases the vintage were much better. It is too bad that instructions are not included for the vintage as I found several of them to be nicer than the new patterns.
2,Vintage beats vogue,"I have to agree with the other reviewer who said the old designs were much better. I couldn't believe it when I saw it. It was almost worse because they put a picture of the original pattern beside the redesign, and you could see exactly how much better you would have liked the other one. I haven't tried any of the patterns in the book yet because they aren't that striking, and also because I'm still feeling bitter that they actually made good designs worse!"
5,This is a great publication for anyone who enjoys knitting and/or crocheting.,"I remember how my mother looked forward to getting The Workbasket and this brings back wonderful memories. It has patterns of beautiful things to knit or crochet, and compares patterns popular in the past with the present."
4,historical romance,Great book. It makes you laugh out loud. The characters are great and you become interested in each one of them. I love the descriptions of the clothes and jewels during that era. This would make a good movie.
3,Ok but a little too silly,Not my favorite read by any stretch as the characters were a bit too silly and over dramatic most of the time.
3,Predictable!,"Yep, it's a predictable romance. I usually enjoy novels set in this era but am not a big fan of romance novels. Combine the two and it was just a very light read that was not something that I would recommend."
5,Great exposition of the Regency period,Years ago I read everything Georgette Heyer had written which our library had. I think she does a great job with the period and I appreciate her delicate handling of sex and violence. I intend to reread her books.
4,"Not my cup of tea, but an excellent work from a literary standpoint","First and foremost, a reader needs to remember that this book was written in 1926. It is not a ""modern"" historical romance. Temper your expectations accordingly.There is no bodice ripping. What there is instead, is a complex story of intrigue peppered with colorful, intricate dialogue interdisbursed with French here and there. There is a villan most dastardly. There is a plot of vengence 20+ years in the making. There is a man with such a reputation that he is called ""Satana""--for good reason, yet capable of deeper feelings than he'd ever thought possible.I won't lie to you---this book is difficult to wade through, especially to one not familiar with French expressions. I found myself constantly hopping over to Babelfish and the like to translate a sentence here or there. But, it is worth the slow pace of digestion in the end. Be patient with it and you will find satisfaction in the end."
3,A mixed bag for me,"I opened this book with great expectiations, having seen it so highly lauded by many of my favorite authors. It took me quite some time to get into it. I really did not like the Duke early in the book, although I found him highly amusing as the book wore on, and I never really became fond of Leonie--she comes across as immature rather than spirited. The enormous age difference was a little off-putting to me; I'm not convinced this couple represents one of those great love stories, despite the compelling proposal scene.The use of French in the book provided realism, but often left the reader (unless well-versed in French) a bit out of the loop. Very little of the action actually takes place in England; most is in France. By the way, ignore the cover; the book is Georgian in time period. The Duke's revenge & the intrigue behind it is well-played.Although I eventually enjoyed the book, it'll never be one of my favorites. Sorry, fans."
1,That's what I get for reading others reviews!,"The book sucks. It's taking me forever to get through it. Avon is a prissy French hero in high heels, a fan, and a snuff box, and Leonie is a girl pretending to be a boy who falls to her knees at every opportunity and kisses Avon's hand. A weak story, weak characters, and too much French which I do not speak. How could I have ever wasted space in my Kindle on THIS!?!?!?"
5,Great book,This is one of the first romance book I read. The writing is excellent and the story line is classic. Graphic sexual scenes are not needed to make this book a wonderful read.
4,disappointing book,"I HAVE READ SEVERAL BOOKS BY GEORGETTE HEYER. NORMALLY I ENJOY THEMTHIS SEEMS A SILLY STORY THAT IS TAKING FOREVER TO TELL. IF IT ISPART OF A TRILOGY, I WILL NOT BE INTERESTED IN THE REST."
4,Worth a Read,"Very clever story line, keeps you interested, and the local color of the time is excellent. Mysterious in a laid back way."
2,Period Piece,I really could not get into this book and probably quit reading it after about 30 pages. A foppish man picks up a run-away boy to serve as his page. I was led to believe this man was peculiar and perhaps a pedophile. Maybe later in the book I would discover he was actually a kind man hoping to mentor the child. I have it on my Kindle and may try it another time.
3,Playful story,"I promised my wife I'd read a Georgette Heyer book by year's end, so I did. I woke up before 6am this morning to read it. I didn't love it, but liked it enough to wake up early to finish it. It didn't have the normal English wit that I enjoy, but it was funny and entertaining. I don't think this will be my last Georgette Heyer book."
3,The Duke of Avon is too mean,"It is common for the hero of romances to be something of a SOB, however, this one goes too far. This guy outstrips the limits and is really satanic and cold hearted and even sadistic. I never could accept the romance between him and Leonie. There is no gentleness in him. In addition, she is nineteen and he is in his forties. His son in Devil's Cub is better, wild, dangerous, but with more warmth and consideration, more emotional and reachable than his father.I was also taken aback when reading this book for the first time in high school by the snobbishness. Lower class characters are physically coarse, snub nosed, large pored, big footed. The Duke knows Leonie is an aristo because she is fine boned, small nostriled, delicate, small footed. Usually this kind of thing passes as part of the genre. But this was a little too pronounced."
2,These Old Shades,"To me it is confusing to keep up with who the character are. Keep having to go back and re read. Also, I hate the hero of the story is a prissy man. I couldn't get past the third chapter."
5,Read this first!,This is one of my favorites - if not for Leonie then for the supporting cast of characters. If you read this one then Devil's Cub is a must. Heyer picks up the story 20 some odd years later following the adventures of Justin and Leonie's son.
4,These Old Shades,One of the best of georgette Heyer's books I have read. Very good characters. You find yourself caught up in the timesand feel like you have to try to find something to wear to the balls and parties.
4,These old shades,These Old Shades is a fun adventure/romance with many twists and turns-and no definite outcome until the very last page--but don't read it! The fun is wondering how it will all turn out!
5,Georgette Heyer is still the master and this is one of her best romances.,"I am still in the middle of this book and find it is one of Ms. Heyer's very best. The hero, if you can call this bored, dissolute, rake a hero; still has a certain appeal especially in his treatment of Leon/Leonie. While the heroine is a delightful scamp with enough sass to make her guardian bend from his stiff-backed personage of the Duc. Half of the book takes place in Franc and the action move to England after Leon is unmasked as a girl."
4,Classic romance by Georgette Heyer,"Quite the bestseller in its time, ""These Old Shades"" is my second favorite Heyer novel. Features a jaded duke and a mysterious French mademoiselle in a Twelfth-Night-type plot. Great fun."
4,Nice Bag,"My Marathon car seat fit perfectly in the bag with plenty of space for toys and books. The strap makes it easy to carry the akwardly shaped bag on your shoulder or even across your torso. I checked the bag at the airport twice and noticed minor wear and tear, but nothing too major."
3,OK...but Bulky,We purchased this carseat travel bag to use in airports. We used it 2 times when my child was younger and not mobile. Now she is a 19 month old on the go and this bag got just too bulky to carry. I opted to go out and puchase a new travel bag with wheels...it works MUCH better...you may not have both hands to work with but you can keep up the pace.
2,Hard to get seat in,"We had this for a little while in the quest for one good bag that would meet our needs. There is only one zipper down the center so it opens like a clam shell, which makes it really tough to get the seat in and out. It naturally wants to close as you push something in or pull it out, so it just made it a frustrating experience. The single strap is pretty useless, too, because there is no way to effectively carry it despite what the smiling people in the pictures look like. It hurts your back and is off balance so you need to hold the seat, which means it really doesn't make it hand(s)-freeThe only reason it doesn't get one star is that there are worse ones on the market."
4,Luckily I bought it!,Great purchase! It kept my sons Britax car seat from getting wet and dirty! Could be a bit longer to fit a Britax car seat with a GoGo Kidz TravelMate attached!
2,great size but not durable,"We used this product once which was wonderful while the strap lasted. On our way back home from vacation the strap broke in the airport before we even made it to check our luggage. The size is great, but the one over the shoulder or across the chest strap is a loss. Two shoulder straps would probably have made this bag much more efficient and durable. Maybe they will come out with a new and improved bag."
4,"Great car seat bag, but can rip","I purchased this car seat bag to use for airline travel. The 2nd time after I checked it as luggage, it had a big hole/rip in the bottom of it. Since the fabric of the bag seems to be pretty sturdy, I was pretty surprised to see the hole, especially only after being checked as luggage twice. But I used duct tape to fix the hole, and it survived two more trips. Overall, this is a great bag (especially for the price)-- but just know that it can rip if you're checking it as luggage."
5,Will never leave home without it!,My family has travelled extensively since our twins were born in March. We unfortunately didn't have this with us on our first trip and it rained so the boys' seats were wet when we picked them up at baggage claim. So when we got home I went right out and purchased two bags. We have used them over and over with infant carriers and bases and were even able to use the extra space when we overpacked suitcases. Other than the plastic strap loop breaking on us we love it and you can't beat the price!
5,Great Buy!!,"This bag held up great and was well worth the money spent. It was very roomy- Not only did it hold our toddler's huge car seat, but we were able to store the base to our infant seat in it as well."
4,Overall a good product,We travel a lot with our two year old and have always bought a plane seat for her. This bag makes it easier to carry her carset and other supplies while running through the airport. Overall it is very durable with one exception. We have been in situations where we have had to drag this bag and there are now some holes in it. The truth is not many products would not have a hole if they were treated how we have treated this bag. The best solution (and one I would love) is if they would come out with a similar product that had wheels.
4,Great for Travel,"We loved this car seat travel bag. It doesn't provide the best protection since it's thin material, but my car seat hasn't been damaged and we have used it for 2 years now. I would practice putting your seat in it at home so you aren't struggling with it at the airport. Don't lose the straps it becomes a pain to carry. My husband has to lug this around, he wishes it was more of a back pack then a duffle bag, but this really is a great item. Even our huge Wizard Convertible car seat fits in this."
1,I have a question?????????????????????????,Does this cover fit the Eddie Bauer Blue Glacier Booster? I can't find any descriptions of dimensions.Thank you.
5,Awesome! Once you figure out which way is up. :),"Once you figure out which way your carseat goes in, this product is AMAZING! I was able to fit a large carseat in it as well as some other junk that would not fit in my suitcase. I LOVE this item!!!! Very durable, and keeps your carseat protected from abusive handling by the airlines! Don't hesitate - buy this!"
1,GrrrArgh! BABY size!,"I ordered two of these to replace ones which were lost. BE FOREWARNED! Nowhere does it say this bag is for BABY car seats only! It will not fit regular size car seats or boosters! It says it on the packaging once you receive it, but not on the web page.We live overseas and have always used car seat bags to save our car seats from dmage, so we do think they are great products."
1,very disappointed,I bought this travel bag with the expectation that I would be able to use it for many trips to come and was very disappointed that it didn't last even one trip. I flew one way and when I retrieved my bag it was torn on the bottom and top. The bag cannot be used again.
3,The Amusement Never Ends,"It's not a ""good"" movie. I'm not even sure I'd call it ""well done."" However, it is the most amusing thing I've seen in a long time. Zombies, an 80's ""hard rock"" band, a bass line that brings back the dead, midgets, and Hitler. What more do you need to know?"
4,Better than Citizen Cane+ Casablanca,"The only reason this doesn't get a 5 star review is because, the audio isn't Dolby 5.1, these songs won Oscars!!!IN THE FUTURE.Own this movie. Everyone you know will think you the better person for it.It's shame about the poor audio quality, but you can still get a glimpse of the aural bliss to complicate this visual feast of a movie.They just don't make them like they used too, eh?"
5,A real page turner,"This book has the most interesting plot and most fully developed characters of any of the Cold Fusion books on the market. Although I personally have some reservations about the graphic ... activity depicted in chapter four, most readers will find this par for the course in today's publishing world. Get your copy now!"
1,Waste of time,"The beginning was OK but when it came time to do the tutorials, there were no data files. None on the CD and none on the Sam's website like the book said. I bought this book because I needed a tutorial, not a ""book to read"" but thanks to the incompetency of the publishers, this so called ""tutorial"" isn't a tutorial at all. It's a waste of money and a waste of time."
1,Watch out--this is Volume One!,Amazon refuses to fix this problem. They are trying to list Timm's Karl Kraus volume one paperback as volume two in a paperback edition which apparently does not exist. Buyer beware!
5,How has this gem been overlooked ?,"It is obvious that Steve Coleman is not interested in labels - but in music. This cd is to jazzy to be strictly funk, to funky to be strictly jazz, and very African throughout. The rhythms may give the illusion of simple music - but when they are closely listened to, they are intricate and sophisticated. The melodies and harmonies sound like nothing else - completely original. You are warned that it is addictive !This cd has Coleman and and the Five Elements playing beautifully and originally. The cast is impressive: David Gilmore (guitar), Reggie Washington (bass), Marvin ""Smitty"" Smith (drums), James Weidman (keyboard), Andy Milne (keyboard). Special guests are Greg Osby (alto sax), Michael Wimberly (percussion), Don Byron (clarinet and bass clarinet), Lance Bryant (tenor sax), Cassandra Wilson (vocals), Camille Gainer (drums) and Meshell Johnson (bass).If it is available - but it now !"
2,pdcreview,"Having discovered Charles Siringo & wanting to learn more about him, I thought this item would add to the knowledge. Advertised as a book, it was in fact a 18 page overpriced booklet containing no new information which I did not already read from Siringo's book A Texas Cowboy. The idea of a ""Great Western Series"" in the sixties was logical but sadly missing in detail and depth. A more serious effort should be made to combine all of Siringo's works, for he seems to be an authentic hell raising cowboy as there ever was in the 1870's and 1880's."
1,Garbage! Not C2G cable,I ordered this cable and couldn't wait for it to arrive. What I got was some knock off no name brand in a plastic bag without the C2G logo on the bag. No where on the cable is it labeled Cables To Go either. My 5 foot black C2G cables are great...they are the real C2G cables but this orange one is a knock off.....I got ripped off.
3,OK but marred by not including Persian pronunciation,"I am a native English speaker, learning Persian. This is an otherwise excellent dictionary, that suffers from one glaring defect. While it includes the pronunciation of English word entries, it does not include the pronunciation of Persian word entries. The Persian words do not include the vowel markings, without which it is impossible for a non-Persian to learn how to pronounce them. It is clearly designed for native Persian speakers to learn English, not vice-versa. But is so easily could be improved by including the Persian pronunciation! I hope the authors take note of this feedback, and include it in future editions. It would make the work twice as useful."
4,Best I've used,"This dictionary is very useful. It has thousands of entries and is written by two men, one of whom is Iranian and studied in England for years. One may have to cross-reference some words, because it is a foreign language and meanings do not exactly correspond sometimes, until you find the one that fits best.It even gives example uses, and derivatives of usage. I challenge you to find a better one, even in Iran..."
2,Room for improvement,"I feel like I need a magnifying glass to read this dictionary. I appreciate the fact that it has thousands of useful words, but could we make the font just a little larger. Also, it would be nice to have indented letter tabs for quick reference since there are so many words. I feel like it takes forever to just find the letter..."
3,Decent but not advanced,This is a nice looking dictionary and useful for a beginner or mid-level Farsi speaker. If you are at an advanced level or need extensive vocabulary then research some other options as well.
2,needs work,I have been using this dictionary for over a year and I hate it!A good many of the definitions don't match from one language to another. This dictionary is so very poorly organized that it is not even worth the paper it is printed on. Avoid this dictionary if you can.
4,Great book with the right instructor,"I found this book to be easy to read and used it with an online class. With the supplements the instructor provided, I was able to easily get through this online course."
2,Reads like electronic instructions,Book is hard to read and keep up with if you have never taken a regular ethics class before. But alright other than that.
5,Great Collectible for any Bulldog!,"I was a little hesitant making this purchase because the color of the helmet in the photo looks almost more orange than red, but the color is actually Georgia red. The photo should be changed to more accurately represent the color. Otherwise, it's a cool collectible for any sports-basement or ""man-room""."
5,Please Ignore the Negative Reviews,"This book reflects ""BUSINESS AS USUAL"", when it comes to Washington. I found the book to be thought provoking and in line with other accounts by Liberty survivors. The negative reviews are using very phony sounding names and their intention is obvious; they should make you want to read this book even more. Highly recommended."
1,Just another pathetic attempt to rewrite history,"One of the most overused myths of this friendly fire accident is that Israel should have seen the American flag on the ship, however when there is no wind a flag does not fly, it lies limp against the pole. A. Jay Cristol investigated this accident for 14 years and even viewed the plane's gun camera film which showed smoke rising from the Liberty, proving that that the flag would have been impossible to see.Neither of the authors here spent $75,000 of their own money. Neither of these propagandists interviewed the CIA's then station chief at the Tel Aviv embassy. Neither of these bogus authors talked with the 3 living IDF pilots who strafedthe Lberty.In short the information here is mostly based on hearsay that cannot be affirmed by anyone i.e. it's a book based on lies.Don't waste your time with these venomous opinions."
3,Interesting,This book is ok. There are a lot of bibilical quotes but very little explanation. In other words if you read the Bible you already know everything in this book. Nothing extra was added over and above the data in the Bible.
2,Billy Budd,"Billy Budd is a short story in which it tells about the life of a young sailor. It mainly focuses upon the life onboard the Indomitable. It tells how he ticks and what makes him work. The words and usage of language describe the story as a college or older high school type of literature. It is very hard to understand at first, but after a few tries you will understand."
2,What a God Awful Book,"This is an awful book. It could have been a lot longer, who were these people who wrote the letter and what happened to them anyway. What could have happened is that the Intro should have been longer, names could have signed. It is not the best book written. Dear America: Letters from Vietnam was so much better. In Letter from Vietnam you find out what happened to the soldiers."
5,Very good purchase!,"The book arrived in the extimated date and the situation of the book, described as good, was better than expected. Very good purchase for an exchange student as me, I saved U$ 35,00. Thank you."
1,beware,I had a very bad experience. This toy came and was in a sealed box but when opened there were a lot of missing parts. I had to contact the company to try to replace the parts so that I could build it and it has been a huge headache because even the company was not easily helpful. I dont know who screwed up the seller or playmobil but I am furious about the money I spent and the experience I have had
2,not quite right,"After being told of our Lego preference, grandma bought this. The children are frustrated because it is hard to get together and stay together long enough to play with.I would not recommend this to a child under 7, because of the amount of parent time needed to put it together and keep it together, if your going to use it for younger children -- super glue it together."
1,Major Disappointment,"I agree 100% with the last review. While I had high hopes for this book after reading H.O.L., I quit trying to read this book after several attempts. I did follow the publisher's recommendation to alternate reading a few pages from each story, but it didn't help. Finally, I skipped to the end of both and put it down for good.The formatting does seem gimmacky,and the writing, for me at least, quickly became tedious."
1,"An awful book, virtually unreadable","There might be some people out there who liked this book. I however, am not one of them. This is a terrible read, one which will most likely disappoint everyone who's read House of Leaves and found it a refreshing glimpse into horror fiction in the new millenium. Only Revolutions has been described elsewhere as Only Revolting and I couldn't agree more. There should be an automatic refund option somewhere for unhappy buyers to claim their money back."
4,"Trying, but no HoL.","I'll be the first to say, I absolutely fell in love with House of Leaves, this lead me to read more of Danielewski, that of which I do not regret. The whalestoe letters were great, and the 50 year sword, amazing.This is not to be classed with those books.This book is more of a freeform poetry style of writing, and is notoriously difficult to read. You read 8 pages of Sam, and then flip and read 8 pages of Hailey. You'll understand that when you get it. The book chronicles the road trip of a young couple, and is very well stylized in doing so.I wouldn't dare say this book is bad, and overall I'd recommend this book. I was just hoping for something as engrossing as House of Leaves. It let me down in that aspect, but it also surprised me in many ways."
2,Only Revolutions,"ummm...started it...put it down...one of these days ill pick it up...but you really need to devote a ton of time to get thru the upwards and downwards and backwards and forwards... I dont know, Ill take Steven King's books over these any day."
2,So what?,"Eh.I suppose we're meant to be so taken with this trifle's claustrophobic formal ditherings that we won't notice its trite and adolescent pseudo-intellectual blitherings. A more interesting read if one imagines that Sam and Hailey are siblings, as has been suggested in a few online forums. And where does this author go from here--Scratch and sniff smell-o-drama? A book with embedded chips that's also a musical? One with a pullstring?""The protagonist says, 'Moo!'?""On the whole, more poesy than poetic, more puzzling than puzzle, more...is definitely LESS, I'm afraid. Again."
2,"This is a work of art. It's not a novel, nor is it a narrative.","I loved House of Leaves, and, in a way, I was not disappointed by Only Revolutions.Where HoL was art and readable as narrative, OR is a work of art not readable as narrative. If you're looking for a read, this isn't it. If you're looking for fine binding combined with exquisite typography, this is your book.Make no mistake: I take the book out occasionally, and look at it, and admire it. But I can't read it, and I suspect few can. But by gosh, it's beautiful."
1,Rubbish !,"It seems this is either a one star or five star review. Sadly, all the one people got it right. And I really enjoyed House of Leaves."
2,Doesn't live up to its predecessor.,"House of Leaves = Awesome book. I got a tattoo for it.Only Revolutions = Not so awesome. I struggled to get through it; the prose and rhyming was annoying.If you are really into fiction written in overbearing prose, try reading this book. If you want to attempt it for the sake of it being a Mark Z. Danielewski book, good luck."
1,You were NOT there.,Randomness! Word salads! Stream of consciousness! Everyone reads the book but I review it. Second novel and oh so preeeeeeetentious! The cause: writer that believes his own hype becomes so inudated with mathematical page layout that he looses sight of telling story. Sophomore slump in the extreme. Can only hope The Familiar will recapture the magic of House of Leaves.
2,Reach exceeding grasp?,"I really liked ""House of Leaves."" ""Only Revolutions"" is incomprehensible. On the other hand, if you never try and fail, you don't know what you're capable of. Here's to more glorious failures."
4,It's fun to flip a book!,"Have you ever tried that experiment where you read a paragraph but most of the letters inside the words are gone, yet you can still make sense of it? That's kinda how I feel about this book. I have to admit that at first I was very let down (I think many of us were expecting another HOL) but then it really grabbed me. I started to enjoy the task of figuring out what was going on and the flow of the book along with unexpected moments of beauty really ended up hooking me. I think that if you are in the right mindset for a puzzling but beautiful and very unconventional book then you will enjoy! Not for everyone though so be warned!"
1,A disappointing departure fom House of Leaves,"Only Revolutions is a crumby follow-up to House of Leaves. The plot is nigh-incomprehensible, the ridiculous structure detract from the novel rather than add to it, and all-in-all, the book is not a fun read. I didn't anticipate it to be as good as House of Leaves, but this sunk below my worst expectations.Only Revolutions is worth, at most, a library visit to verify how bad it is."
3,It doesnt seem new,"I ordered this book a couple days ago and the shipping was extremely fast, which was awesome. However, I did order a new copy, but the condition of the book when I received it suggests otherwise. The jacket is torn and peeling around the edges and corners of the book are dented. Kind of disappointing."
3,Good start for stories of the egyptian gods,"It's well put together, the only problems I had with the book were the author putting in mythology from other countries in. Studying mythology is hard enough without gettin them confused with other ancient religions as well. But it's a great start for learning the myths, not as many stories as you'd think by the title, there are short versions of stories (and mainly the popular ones which I already knew of), but it left me craving more stories and more of the stories that the author told and left out."
4,Good book for the money...,"We just got back fron a two week trip to the Hawaiian Islands. We visited three islands, Kau'ai, Oahu, and Hawai'i. The book proved to be a valuable tool to have during our visit. I'm not sure that I always agreed with the author's opinion on some things, but overall most of his tips were good ones. I paid $11 for the book and considering the cost of the trip, having this book or one like it is very worthwhile."
4,Greatest Big Band Jazz Ballad Ever !,"I bought this CD just for the piece ""Pipe Dreams"", which was originally recorded on ""A Different Drummer"". It is worth the price of the CD to hear this soulfull ballad and a rare treat to hear Buddy lay a quiet groove with the brushes. Lots of straight ahead BIG BAND on the rest of this compilation CD."
4,Decent Compilation,"Half of this CD was on an album I once owned. The rest contains a couple of tracks with a smaller group, and then the Piece of the Road Suite from a much older album. Playing is pretty good, but better on the more recent tracks. Dave Stahl and Jon Faddis play on this, as do Bob Mintzer and Steve Marcus, so there are great moments on tracks like Ya Gotta Try and No Jive. The second track is actually ""Time Out"" by Don Menza, mislabelled here as Tales of Rhoda Rat (which was on the original album I had but is not here).Lin Biviano, a trumpet player I never liked much , is in the band for the Piece of the Road Suite (which is an OK chart I played once with our University Band) and sounds kind of scratchy and weak on solo and lead. Faddis sounds great, and Buddy's playing is as good as his best."
1,Poor Product,After purchase of this product I found the temperature to be inaccurate (97 degrees to start and then got lower and lower over a week to 93 degrees). Not acceptable! The product was returned for a refund.
2,not what I expected from HoMedics,"I gave up on this after trying it a few times- as some of the other reviews mention, it consistently reads a low temperature. And don't use it without the covers, the taste is awful in your mouth."
2,Quality not good.,"I don't know how accurately it measures temperatures, since I was only using it to check for fevers. However, I can say that this thing fell apart -- the back kept coming loose. I wouldn't buy one again."
5,from bose to yamaha,"I recently bought the Yamaha HTR-5640 and couldnt be happier about my switch. I have owned a Bose Lifestyles 8 Series II for about 2 years prior to the Yamaha. It will now be in my bed room as a secondary system. The problem with my Bose is not sound producton, it just is'nt prepared for the present or the future. I currently have my Yamaha strapped with a 6.1 Yamaha speaker package and notice a lot of different ranges of sound I wasnt hearing with my Bose. This reciever comes with 3 component outputs and 2 digital and also has dvd audio inputs. For $299.00 thats a steal."
4,"almost excelent, but","I bought this 8 days ago from a retailer. It has great, clean sound, the problem is it allows you to input only two digital sources. It is difficult to see the wisdom behind to come up with such a good product with such inconsistency. This is the digital age. Competitors whose products are even cheaper than this one allow you to connect five digital sources in a combination of optical and coaxial input jacks. If you insist to have this option, you either buy a from a competitor such as JVC RX-7030VBK or SONY STRDE695 and save money or buy the next step up in Yamaha which of course means emptying your pocket. I can exchange this, and I will in the next few days, but not with a more expensive Yamaha."
5,Individual Patterns To Social Manifestations,"This is one book that explains the rudimentary reasons we are at this crucial stage of our personal and social development. Our society is at a crossroads. Because of the major advances in technology we can no longer afford to linger in behaviors that limit our ability to adjust into an advanced culture. Because dysfunctional personalities now dominate our major social institutions it behooves us to understand how and why this has happened. What we are left with is the responsibility and realization that real social change happens one person at a time, and this book is a vital tool in that quest."
4,Not bad!!,"It works, but i think i need it something stronger...I had a lot of pain after drinking the pills and the taste is not that good neither, but for my mom it did work.."
1,waste of money,"Did not work from the first day. So disappointing! No way to return or replace this item. cheap plastic. Looks good in photo, but no good in person."
1,"If by copper, you mean brown plastic...",So ugly! I certainly didn't expect real copper for this price but I thought it would at least be a copper colored sheet metal. BROWN PLASTIC is what this is. Hideous and cheap looking.
1,Disappointed...,"The fountain was very pretty after I got it set up with lots of rocks. However, the light at the top went out after two weeks, and the pump stopped working a week after that. Would NOT recommend buying this."
3,Okay at best,"I've had multiple tabletop fountains, and can say this is one is OKAY, not great. I was hoping that with the light and circulating water this fountain would give me what I wanted, however, I was disappointed. The light worked great, but the fountain was easily gunked up, and hard to clean. Honestly, it was a pain to clean, as I had to remove the rocks, base, then flush the lines to allow for water flow. Thankfully, I have access to syringes so I was able to flush the lines, otherwise I don't think the fountain would work for very long. It's now been discarded, as it was too much effort :("
2,Disappointed,This fountain was advertised as being copper. It's actually green plastic. Buyer beware.
5,Ships Ahoy! It works!,"For a rather inexpensive, it works just fine. It is very, very quiet as long as you keep s sufficient amout of water in the boat. I put a couple of very small animals amoungst the rocks and this adds a little life to the scene."
2,Cheap Junk,"I even tried to add my own rocks and make it look better, but it still looks & sounds like a piece of plastic with a small motor inside. Broke down after about 60 days. When they say copper, they mean copper color. Their is no metal parts or copper in this product.But it was cheap, not entirely deserving of 1 star.. I told my spouse it was junk, and you can clearly see from the picture and product description that it is junk. So if you are buying it, at least you know what you are getting. And if you didn't know, I think my review will also help you to know now.It would definitely be better if:1. The actual frame looked nice instead of cheap plastic junk2. They included enough rocks to actually fill up the bottom3. They took the LED lights out4. The motor lasted longer than 2 months."
2,Fountain,"Pump was too small, couldn't pump enough water to make any water fall noise with the water. Light not bright enough."
2,Buyer Beware,"This fountain looks nothing like the picture. This product is made of plastic. It looks like plastic. The rocks provided don't cover half the bottom so be prepared to add rocks to make it look nice. If this wasn't a Christmas present, I would return it. I am really disappointed in HoMedics selling this product for $35.00. It isn't worth $10."
3,HMMM,"have to say that I really expected this fountain to be a bit bigger. yes the light, the sound of the water is somewhat nice, but the 20 thumb sized rocks were barely enough to place 2 or 3 on each leaf, and cover 10 of the bottom base. the plastic is also just that...""PLASTIC"" ANY KIND OF METAL WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER AS THIS IS MOST DEFINITELY NOT CAT PROOF..."
3,too quiet,Fountain is OK.... WAY too quiet to hear soft gentle trickle of water cascading down. Cheap looking plastic material used... makes a good donation for thrift stores
3,Great....when it worked,"My wife got this for Christmas one year. We used it every night and it was great the first few months. As the spring rolled around and we started sleeping with the windows open, we did not run it. Once Summer was here and we had to close back up and run the AC, we went to start using it again and it would not run. I took it apart and could not get it to run at all. Eventually I was able to get it to work but found that the pump will freeze and needs to be opened up and manually turned while set on to get it going. Basically, it cannot sit for longer than a day without the motor locking up.The other problem with this is that it does not have a very good water sound as pictured. We found that we had to take some of the stones and put them in key spots on the leaves to get a good a nice water fountain sound.PROS:Nice lookLED lights under the leavesNice river rocksCONS:Motor is inconsistentBronze looks wears off after some timeHave to move rocks around to get the nice sound."
2,Nice fountain but the lights burn out very quickly,Homedics Envirascape Garden Leaves Relaxation FountainI received this fountain for Christmas 2006. By July 2007 I had to send it to Homedics to get a replacement since all of the lights were burned out. By January 2008 all of the lights are burned out again. I really like this fountain but will not buy another.
2,Fountain broke after 5 weeks!,"Buyer beware! It is a nice fountain, and I was happy with it. It requires a weekly change of water or else it gets noisy, and daily additions of water to keep it full. Mine just stopped working one day after 5 weeks of use. I can't return it through Amazon, and I'll have to pay $7 shipping to return it to Homedics."
2,poor,"While the fountain does what it's supposed to do,the color in the photo is is not the color ofthe unit itself. It's brown, plastic, and lookscheap. I don't understand where the copper comesfrom until you turn it on. The light gives it abit of copper color. Also, the stones around thebase. You can't even cover a quarter of it. Ihave to buy more.Overall, I guess you get what you pay for, however,I have paid less and gotten more."
1,Looks great but NO water sounds,"The only sound I could hear was the motor gently humming. There were no water noises. I tried placing rocks on the different leaf-platforms but that didn't help. The fountain is made of plastic, not copper. The photo is accurate. It is pretty, table-top sized and the lights were nice.I was so grateful that the Amazon return process was easy."
2,Please don't waste your money :(,"My husband and I recently celebrated our seventh wedding anniversary, and one of the traditional seventh anniversary gifts is copper. I bought this fountain, thinking that it would be beautiful for my husband's desk at home or at work. Wrong! It's made of cheap plastic and is NOT copper at all. It's dark plastic meant to *look* like copper from a distance (but it doesn't, really). The rocks that are included aren't big at all ~ they're more like pebbles! There aren't even enough to cover the bottom. The fountain is very small. I'm totally returning this item and saving my $30 for a *real* copper fountain someday."
4,Nice fountain but the water reserve is too small,"I think this is a great product with one exception. The bowl at the bottom is too small. I live in a dry environment and literally had to refill this fountain twice a day or it would stop making the splashing sound I bought it for because there was no longer any water underneath the flow for it to fall upon. I ended up replacing the bowl with something much larger and deeper so I wouldn't have to refill it as often and am happy with the results. But you shouldn't have to do this. If you don't mind ""engineering"" it a bit upon arrival you will be happy with this."
1,"Nice idea, but poorly executed","I purchased this fountain at Target and was disappointed when I opened it at home. It's made of brown plastic that does not come close to resembling copper. In my opinion, it looks very cheap. I searched for the fountain on Amazon to read reviewer comments. They confirm my concerns...that the fountain likely won't last long. I will return it."
1,Don't waste your money,"I ordered - and returned - two of these before I gave up and switched to a different model HoMedics fountain. The lights went out after less than 2 weeks. On TWO of them. It must be a design flaw. I had purchased other HoMedics fountains (different designs) and never had a problem. But, this one is a loser. The Shimmering Towers (which looks like candles) works well and holds up well. The last time I returned this model, I switched back to the Shimmering Towers."
3,fountain,"It's a nice fountain for the price. The pump is a bit noisy and the light is inconsistent but with added rocks, it can sound nice. Sometimes the pump noise seems louder than the water. The plastic does look like cooper and it is appealing."
3,It was enjoyable - till it leaked all over my desk.,I really liked the fountain and received lots of complements on it. The sound isn't too distracting and the pump is really quiet. Everything seemed to work fine when i set it up one afternoon at work. Then when i came in the next day half of the water from the fountain had leaked out the back by where the electric cord comes out.Not sure if this is an issue most people had or if it was just mine. I took it back and swapped it out for a different style of HoMedics fountain just in fear that i would have the same issue if i got another one.Wasn't bothered by the Plastic material because it doesn't look bad. What can you expect for under $40?
2,Highly OK,"Had my expectations a lil high after viewing all the reviews...however, wasn't really happy after I started using it...yes, the motor is quite quiet :) but the sound made by the water is really low even after I adjust the stones to get a lounder sound; at times I really couldn't differentiate btwn the sound of the fountain water and the ones running in my heater pipes :("
1,Disappointed in Denver,"It wasn't coppery colored like in the picture (cheap flat colored plastic instead) and even more disappointing, it came missing a tube that was an essential part. I ended up throwing it away, between the two defects it was useless. I won't buy from them again."
1,VERY DISAPOINTING,The motor is louder than the water falling. I wish I'd read the reviews before I bought this. VERY DISAPOINTING
1,good but noisy,"Not bad. Not good. VERY noisy. Had to buy more rocks for the bottom. Pretty, good detail. Somewhat cheesy yellow light on top. Using it, but would not recommend it."
1,JUNK,I bought this product from another store. I expected it to be a nice fountain. It is absolute junk. It may look like it's metal but it is not. It's plastic. The plastic isn't even painted to look like it's metal. It's just brown. I am not even setting it up because it is NOT worth the $35 that I spent on it. I have already boxed it up and am taking it back to the store. Please save yourself the disappointment and DO NOT buy this item.
2,Doesn't last long,"The lights were very pretty at first, but lasted for just a few weeks, although 1 kept working on and off for a few months. We added a lot more rocks to stop the water from splashing: rocks had to be placed on every level-leaf. After 5 months the motor died altogether. It looked nice when it worked, but wish it lasted a lot longer than that."
2,"Great Sound, Very Cheesy and Cheap Looking","This fountain has a nice design and very gentle, soothing sound. The actual construction is CHEAP. It is all plastic and looks chintzy even in a dimly lit room. $20.00 is about the maximum it is worth. About 10 stones came with it, which is not enough to look artistic. The motor is not silent but it's not obnoxiously loud either. I plan on keeping and painting it to make it look a little more chic. If you want to use this in a spot to add some class, fu get about it. I plan on using it in a clinic which is not expected to have anything but the inexpensive furniture found in a community clinic. With some artistic paint work it will add a nice touch and a little feng shui."
2,Very poor quality--won't last for more than two weeks!!!,"Oh man... The idea was really great to create such a fountain with this nice design of garden leaves and lighting but if only it could work for a little longer!! The bulbs were dead by the end of the second week, and the pipes through which the water runs become stained and there is no way to clean them. Finally, the inner surface of the boat gets really tough stain with time and I used endless amount of cleaners to get rid of that stain--no way!!! The water needs to be changed very often, otherwise, it will get sticky and the engine will work slowly... Wheh... Too much work for a little pleasure. Would not recommend this product."
2,Not worth your money,"For $30, you can buy yourself a better fountain. This one was a big disappointment for me. It does look like the one on the picture but it doesn't give you that shiny glare since the whole unit is made of plastic. The rocks included are small, about the size of a penny or a quarter if you get lucky. If you don't care about the plastic, then the fountain might be for you. But that plastic look really bother me and it felt as it was cheaply made. They could've at least spray painted it gold or copper."
5,"Book, ""Concentration - A Guide For Mental Mastery""","This is the best book and the best exercises for increasing your ability to concentration and mastering your thinking, that I have ever read. I lived in a Yoga Ashram for 2 years in the 1960's and this was one of the books that were like our text books. I have done the concentration exercises in this book and if the student is diligent and does ""exactly"" what Mouni Sadhu says to do, they will be able to increase their ability to concentrate to a degree that they would not have imagined possible."
1,Not What I Expected,"This product was not what I expected. I purchased it based on the raving reviews I read on this site and other shopping sites. The product had an unusual odor. That didn't bother me too much, as it faded upon application. However, the coverage was extremely light and was not buildable. The only thing good about the product it it's hygienic packaging. Since I couldn't return it, I was forced to sell it at a very high discount. I would not recommend this product to anyone looking for medium-to-full coverage in a foundation."
3,Foundation,I think its overrated. Its messy to use and doesn't cover any better than Revlon Colorstay or Almay TLC. I have oily aging skin and would have appreciated information relating to this condition. It is definitely over priced! Won't buy again.
4,VERY PLEASURABLE BEDSIDE BOOK,"My boyfirend and I read this book, one chapter at a time. We tried out all the different sensual and exotic massage techniques described in this book and we were pretty upset when we were finished with the book. We learned many different ways to please and satisfy each other, just by touching each other on different parts of our bodies and by focusing on our pleasure zones. This book offers good advise that can be useful for everyone, especially couples. This was a great book and the price was very reasonable."
1,Nice Try,What we have here is an English import whose author simply helped himself to the title of a very well known American book WORD FOR WORD! There oughta be a law...but I suppose there isn't.
1,garbage,"guru sucks, his voice sounds like he should be reading books on tape and his flow puts u too sleep.."
2,Uninspired,"Those who know Guru's history and provenance will expect this to be a very musical, clever combination of old school and new R & B. It is not. While it has some fairly catchy tracks, particularly ""No Time,"" ""Step In The Arena 2,"" and ""Cave In"" (which samples ""White Lines""), Guru fails to deliver brilliant hooks and breaks, ending up an effort in forced gangsta thuginess. As far as grooves, where Guru once excelled, ""Cave In"" stands at the top, and yet he has to use one of the most overused samples in hip hop. Those who long for more Gang Starr sophistication and meaning must be content with looking back."
3,"Congratulations, you completely missed the point.","This album isn't weak because Guru suddenly changed into super thug. It's weak because Solar's beats are cheesey....because Guru is rehashing old lyrics......and because hip hop is beats AND rhymes...not one or the other. Don't bend it, accept it for what it is.But y'all don't get it. Y'all just know what you heard from him back in '93 and still swing on his nuts because of it. Bottom line, the beats are weak and Guru ain't kickin' it the same.P.S. - notice how the other reviewer only mentioned the dope rhymes? He failed to mention that those kinds of rhymes are few and far in between on this cd.Peace"
2,More Proof Guru is Nothing without Premier,"The title really says it all. Guru has yet to produce a quality album without Premier's assistance. There's a good reason. Guru is one of the most dull, deadpan rappers in the game. With the right beat,anybody can sound okay. But when Guru has to carry a track with his vocals he never manages to do the job."
5,"Men,Ships and the Sea",I was very pleased with the condition of the book. It is going to be a Christmas gift for my son who is in the Navy. I have been very happy with Amazon and the vendors they choose to use.
4,surprise sleeper,"Having been a fan of Sean since A Close Shave, this is the first I'd seen of him outside of a W&G feature. Its right up there w/all the others of AArdman and now my 6 year old wants them all! Bloody hell! I may have to as they are quite good. If you like W&G, you'll love these too."
3,"Great pot, but the rubber on the handles is already loose","I got this pot a couple months ago, and have always washed it by hand. It's a lovely pot, and I still think a good value, and the perfect medium size for a family of four to make veggies in, or a one-meal pot of soup. The nonstick is great. But the rubber on the handles is already loosening, and I suspect I'm going to end up doing something to either try to glue it down, or replace it."
4,Based on what I know so far,"Since I may be going to Korea I thought I would learn a little bit more about the country. This book has been very helpful, providing a thumbnail sketch of the culture and providing good, easy-to-understand background info which puts it in context. Keep in mind I have not actually gone to korea yet so i can't necessarily vouch for its accuracy on current cultural trends."
5,fantastic,"This book makes me LOVE LIFE! Get it if you plan on going to Korea, or just find the ideals of other countries interesting."
2,Korean Culture Awareness,Excellent book on Korea. Gives details on what to expect and how to react. Many things that I did not know....VERY HELPFUL!!!
3,Not All It's Cracked Up To Be,"I was very excited about this book when I first got it. I bought a copy for myself and one for each of my daughters, who were going to Korea to teach English. I faithfully read it and thought it was a GREAT book...until my daughters got to Korea. Much of what is said about the respect held for teachers in Korea is not true for young people going over to teach English. Many such teachers teach in ""hog-wans"", or after school schools. The kids are NOT particularly respectful to such teachers, despite claims to the contrary in this book. Korea itself seems a bit illogical to American minds. If something is not understood, the response for most Americans is: ""Well, that's Korea for you"". One thing the book did get right is how the Koreans respect older people. That was something that pleased me when I visited my daughters there."
5,"Dates in some aspects, but very useful in a business context","I've lived in S. Korea for 3 years and I continue to draw comparisons to this book. The book addresses the extreme formality of Korean culture and has gone a long way to explaining the cultural differences that I, as an American, see everyday in dealing with Korean people. The most valuable aspects of this book involve the social hierarchy and how Koreans view friendships. Many westerners view the Korean people as ""rude"", but I now see them as a warm and generous people that do not give their friendship lightly. It does not address the younger generations because of when it was written and how fast it's changing here. However, it's extremely valuable nonetheless. There are many things we can learn from each other and this book goes a log way towards that."
5,Great!,It works great and it wasn't expensive! Just what I needed! I recommend it to anyone who wants to use a product like this.
4,"Dated, but still worth it","As other reviewers have mentioned, some of the information in this book is dated-- but these days that's almost impossible to avoid. Society is currently changing so rapidly in Korea that even something written a year ago would be outdated now. Also, many of the customs and rules listed are still applicable but not quite as important as the book suggests. Nevertheless, this book should still be required reading before ANY trip to Korea, short- or long-term. It'll give you a much better perspective on where Korean culture has been and where it's going now. Once you arrive you may find yourself overprepared with this book-- but that's much better than the other way around."
4,Don't Leave Home Without It (or an updated version)!,"This book answers many common questions about Korean culture. With humor, insight, and understanding, it explains why Koreans do the things they do, especially those things that boggle foreigners staying in Korea (the scoop on personal space, ettiquette with strangers, formal language, work relationships, etc.).It is, understandibly, OUTDATED. (I believe there is an updated version available, which I haven't read yet.) Read it anyway, if you are going to Korea. You will be prepared for the cultural conflicts you run into; You just might not run into as many differences as the book lead you to expect.Highly recommended!"
3,Over priced,"I was a bit disappointed with the quality of the film, it was poor. This DVD was certainly over priced, but I do love Motown music."
3,Nice collection,I bought this as a present and they liked it very much. The audio video quality is not that great.
5,FOR MY DAD: PART #4,"I didn't watch this myself, it was a purchase for my father who seems to love it. If he likes it I love it"
3,DVD review,"The music is great.I am disappointed the disc won't play in my car, which is where I would have been using it most. I have to play it on my computer."
1,Motown - WORSE MADE MEDIA I HAVE EVER VIEWED,"This item was made in a back alley it is so badly done and obviously by some inexperienced individual going through personally taped concerts from broken down VHS tapes that are possibly scratched and lacking any original quality or resolution it might have at one time had.There are lines running through some of the musical sets, offset and horrible view. Worst, absolutely the worst made DVD I have yet seen. I love Motown and own many DVDs of this excellent music era. I was ripped off knowing I paid certainly more than the 25 cents for its value.I want my money back, this is garbage.Highly disappointing!!!!"
2,"Good idea, but poor execution","This DVD was something I looked forward to, but unfortunately, fell short of my expectations. First, off.... the first video of ""Please Mr. Postman"" by the Marvelettes carries HORRIFIC film faults running down BOTH SIDES of the picture throughout the entire performance. The sad part is that Universal released this sad quality version on DVD when the same footage on YOUTUBE doesn't carry that fault (Only has minor fault on one side, intermittently)a rank amateur obviously did the transfers for this DVD, as color balance if off many times, and some clips have been artificially sharpened, and the result is VERY grainy footage. Universal was also very cheap in that they did no digital correction of any film or video tape faults. The clip of ""Tears Of A Clown"" looks great, until the color flickers in a couple of places, something that could have easliy been corrected with today's technology."
2,Disappointed,"With the thousands of hours of video that must be available of these fabulous Motown stars, I can't believe this is the best they can come up with. The film is often very grainy and in poor condition. The Temptations are seen doing My Girl with such poor footage that their heads are cut off at the top for much of the song. There is more bad than good. And forget about the ""Bonus"" features. There are way better Motown videos available."
5,DVD Review,"What can I say, I loved it, especially knowing that the great voices of Mary Wells, Eddie Kendrick and David Ruffin are no longer with us. This is must if you fans of MOtown and wnat to catch one of the lat real performance of Mary Wells. This is a collectable DVD."
2,Motwon DVD disappointing,"Great song selection and interesting extras but the guts of this DVD were disappointing. Almost all were lip-syynched TV show performances. Although there were some historically interesting Mike Douglas, Lloyd Thaxton TV show videos, I was anticipating more live music performances. Oh well. Still the price was right."
4,A Classic DVD!!,"This was a great concept. Although there were times in certain areas of the video, the quality was gritty and streaky. Overall, this is an excellent dvd showing the classic motown performers in their prime. The video also shows, these performers had a strong support system in Berry Gordy. With that factor, and their strong work ethic to their profession, they were successful. Hard work and dedication paid off for many of these performers. I would recommend this treasure to anyone who would like see how the motown sound was created."
2,Not the Real Deal!,I was very disappointed. I was expecting the artists to be performing their original songs. These performances were t.v. performances on Mike Douglas show and so forth. Not the real deal1
4,Made to Last,Very happy with this slotted spoon. I wish the end was a little flatter to aid in degassing pots and pans.
2,Stay out of THE CAVE,"I'm curious as if the writers were in a dark cave when they wrote the script. Stealing from MIMIC, THE CAVE tells the story of . . . well, creatures in a cave. That's about it. The beginning is slow, the middle is confusing, and the end is pathetic. However, don't take my word for it. It's the first movie I've seen in years that was boohed! Two people that left the theatre said that it ""sucked."" And several others said ""it wasn't very good."" On the flip side, two people said they liked it . . . just not as passionately as those who hated it!"
4,Better than expected!,"I know most people will dismiss this movie quickly as yet another ""something evil and flesh-eating in the dark"" in the vein of many a cheesy man-eating creature movie, but I thought the story was good, even if none of the characters were very memorable. Better than any straight-to video creature movie (-killer gators/sharks/mutated things), although still predictable in the age-old formula of characters going back after the others instead of getting the hell out. You know when the attacks are coming and who is next because it foreshadows, but it still provides entertainment and makes an attempt at a plot. A good way to pass the time and a must-see for horror movie fans. Open-ended for a sequel...I'd watch it again, and it was much better than a similar themed ""Descent""."
2,"Preditable, and already done","There was nothing about this movie that stood out as great. It was just another monster eats everyone movie.The only thing that made this tolerable was knowing that the movie was almost over when characters began dwindling down. Typical horror flick, you know the movie is almost over when you are left with the white guy, the black guy and a female.May be a good idea to watch for laughs, but don't expect anything great."
2,Good well almost ....A little short on substance of Plot.,"I like the sets like the other reviewers mentioned , but i thought the diagloue was woody and dull only some of the script was interesting to listen to. there was soo much this film could've been , but it lacked all which was too bad i actually like this one, especially for the the underwater photography done it was nice and water monster nicely done , but all in vain because there was no solid plot to hold it together . i found myself at times wanting to laugh even though this was a serious film i thought so i held my laughter. but i have to say this film was way better than that joke of a film octopus that was prize turkey of a film. this was a 100 times better.in closing i wish the screenwriter just would've made a tighter script that'd make you care for the characters in the movie , all in all it's decent rental Oh and for you (Lost Fans) Out There The Guy That Plays Jin Has A Part In This Film. He's Good in Part."
2,Pitch Black Under Ground.,"the story follows a group of highly skilled cave divers and scientists as they make their way to romania to explore a newly found cave system. Naturally they somehow get stuck while in the system and not only have to find their way out, but also deal with a pesky new species of deadly creatures living there. Cliches and predictability run rampant throughout the film, but a couple things kept the story somewhat intresting (mostly what happens to our lead.) Sadly, the film is full of flaws, lack of scares, and too much studio handy work. A decent renter if you're not looking to use your brain four an hour-and-a-half. Otherwise, if you're looking for a good story with lots of scares, I suggest checking The Descent. Also the flick pretty much plays out as I expected, predictable story, cheesy lines and a pretty cast that does'nt fit the characters they play. Regardless, I did find the movie to be midly entertaing popcorn horror flick."
2,"""Pitch Black"" meets ""Alien"" -- but you can't see anything!!!!","This film is so visually dark/poorly lit and edited that you can't see what's going on half the time. Or, the editing is so fast, you have NO IDEA what happened. Yeah, he or she was killed, but how did it happen?There is only ONE good scene, when the women is trying to swing from cliff's edge to edge to escape from one of the aliens. It's a nice, big visual scene as she swings and there's genuine tension.Best of all, when she lands safely to the other side and shakes her fist at the beast she got away from, her eyes get big and she screams, ""They have WINGS!""But the rest is just awful and lame..."
1,Horrible,"I love a good sci-fi horror type flick, but this was unbearable. I did stick with it though (in hopes it would improve). But, it finally wore me down and I had better things to do with my time ... like wash my hair :)I shut it off about an hour in, and never looked back."
1,This Film Cures Insomnia!!!,"While watching this horrible excuse for cinema, my friend and I dozed off. When I awoke I realized that this was some of the best shut-eye I caught in a long time. Needless to say, this film was tiresome to watch. Horrid acting, bad special effects and a very stupid storyline can lull insomniacs to sleep. This is the kind of film you watch when you've gorged on a whole pound of chocolate, four cups of caffeinated coffee, and a two liter Coke and you need to get rest for a very important job interview. To sum it all up, this film was a lulling mess!!"
1,Didn't i see this movie before????,"The drugs of Hollywood! No talent, nothing creative, same old music,. The ""B"" movies of the 1950's were 100% better than this piece of trash. To bad Hollywood wasn't located in New Orleans."
1,Horrible,"The Cave was a horrible movie that should have never been made. It's totally a rip off of Alien, or ""Alien in a Cave"" as I like to call it. I feel like an idiot for wasting eight dollars to go see this movie in the theater, I would not wish this movie on anyone. SAVE YOUR MONEY. BUT IF YOU MUST SEE IT FOR YOUR SELF WAIT TILL SOMEONE YOU KNOW RENT'S OR BUY'S IT. I PERSONALLY WOULD GIVE IT A -5 IF I COULD."
5,whats is up,whats up am i the only one that thinks this is a totally aswome movie. come on give it a break its hollywood its underground and its a sci-fi\horror. and the sets are some of the best i have ever seen. moral of the story just go watch this movie and enjoy it.
2,"alien, abyss, the thing, etc, but miserably fails","This is a genre horror movie. It is a find the monster in the maze, until he starts eating you, type of thriller. The only intrigue is that the batlike creatures infect humans to become them, and survive in subterra. Thus these explorers are really just chasing explorers from 30 years ago, who perhaps wanted the transformation.The movie fails is every way imaginable. Watching it makes you appreciate other B grade flicks like this, that somehow capture your imagination, or are in some way suspenseful. Making movies is not easy, and ones like the cave make you appreciate that fact."
4,"Throw the haters in the wastebasket on this one, really really surprisingly good!!","I passed it by for years. Heard the horror stories, avoided it. Was on a stint recently of Neil Marshall, and so this came up as a 'might also like' and man it was so intense. To make a film virtually entire in the dark, must be brutal, lots of those horrid B horror films, we so love to hate, are so hard to see anything, but with The Cave, there is enough light to enjoy the immense world around you. I was genuinely impressed with the monsters in this film. Everything was really well done. The long traverses as well really edge of your seat stuff. I loved it!"
4,"Enjoy ""the Cave"" for what it is-- a monster flick","The cave is a monster movie with great sets, impressive camera work, nice editing, and despite all the really negative reviews-- a fun story.Yes-- the characters were cardboard cutouts, and it was almost fun watching a few of them getting picked off just because they were so annoying. The ending was a little too abrupt, and trails off so as to keep it open for a sequel. You have to pay attention to the beginning of the movie to catch the gist of the threat and plot, and figure out the food chain in the Cave-- it's not terribly subtle but some people seem to miss that point.It's not really scary, mature, or and it won't keep you up at night, but it was incredibly fun to watch."
3,"salamanders with wings,somehow that isn't supposed to be boring","I love horror movies from Halloween to Alien. Sadly this movie doesn't hold up to it's to be called horror hell it hardly holds up to be a action or thriller.Don't get me wrong this is an OK movie.The story is great and brings a very oringinal villan and setting. It's just it's so boring they go do the same thig over and over again, they move to another section of the cave it kills someone they freakout do that another five times until the end. If you want to see this movie fine just don't buy it rent you be gald you did. I just hope the sequel wii be better than this crap."
3,"Typical, and Then there were none type fare.","The cave did have some scarey moments with good cinematography but, major flaws abound also. The dialogue of this movie was just horrible the scientists spoke to each other, like high school kids. The climbing action was a bit outside of the realm of normal physics as well,jumping to stationary rocks while swinging at 30 to 40 miles an hour. The monsters were creepy looking, sort of like The Alien. Overall if your looking for a scarey cave monster type movie stick with The Descent,which is pretty much the same formula but much more jump out of your seat."
2,The cave,"The movie itself was fine. The seller on the other hand was not honest about how he labeled this movie. He said it was new, it was not. No wrapping, inside the cover was a blockbuster sticker. WAS NOT NEW AS LISTED. Dishonest seller."
2,"GREAT SETTING, BAD WRITTING AND ACTING!","It is a shame that this film wasn't done better. The cave setting is cool and seems like a fairly fresh idea, but the script and acting are pretty bad and turn this into an OK thriller. Too bad... :-(......"
2,A huge screw-up.,"Could have been really good, but in the end it just looked goofy. I award the 2 stars based upon a cool monster design for the movie, but aside from that I was pretty disappointed.I can't emphasize this enough: See 'The Descent' instead. It has a much smaller budget, but a director who is about a hundred times better at what he does."
3,It was pretty good.,"It was pretty good. The sets were beautiful but the choppy editing didn't really give us the chance to enjoy them. Same goes for the action scenes. The editing was so bad, at times, you didn't know what was going on. This movie needed a better director. But I liked the story, characters, and the monster was pretty cool."
3,A surprising good action/thriller adventure,"I was really surprised witht his movie it was actually good. It was a box office bomb and most people forget this movie actually came out and when you tell them about the movie they will be like what, I've never heard of it. The movie has a good premise cave dwellers go down in a cave that is inhabident my creatures or things and they get stuck there and they try to escape. The movie is rated pg-13 so it's not really scary but it has sacry moments. The movie is also an adventure movie and intersesting at times. The acting is not the greatest and it's a downfall in the movie a big downfall. Overall it was a satisfing surprising action/thriller adventure movie."
3,"The Cave is suspensful, shocking, and I guess it's ""scary.""","The Cave is about a group of explorers exploring a hidden cave that another group of explorers along time ago went missing or believed to be dead. The group finds themselves hunted by a group of monstrous creatures, and now they have to find a way to escape the creatures.The monsters do look real and the setting is amazing. And it has a twist ending which is shocking. I actually would rate it 2 and a half stars, because the movie was kind of okay in a way. I recomend you go watch it in theaters, and it really does scare you!"
1,There are some movies man was never mean to see.,"Horribly done. The plot along with the dialogue and the style of just wandering around the caves is just so boring. This makes DARK WATER better by comparison. And I don't mean comparing two good movies. I mean that compared to THE CAVE, DARK WATER is the lesser of two evils."
4,What is wrong with me? I liked it!,"Some cave explorers, a cave, darkness, some water, and a bunch of winged pyscho alien-predator monsters picking off the aforementioned explores and you get The Cave! Of course this movie is not going to wow you with its plot or acting, although the actors here all did a pretty good job, it was made to scare. Its not all that scary but I liked the creatures, flying around chomping on the explorers, its good fun.Oh, and yes they did copy Alien, but whats wrong with that? The monsters are cool and this movie is a lot better than some other films out there, Anacondas anyone? So enjoy this movie for what it is: A very good directorial debut for Bruce Hunt, with some good effects and cinemetogrophy........And some COOL MONSTERS."
3,Entertaining,"Wife loves monster movies in caves, so this fit the bill well for both of us. Not an all-time classic, but it was entertaining :)"
3,"Bring On The Monsters!.,..","THE CAVE isn't a terrible movie, but it's not that great either. I like the mutant creatures, especially in the water sequences. The cavernous sets are impressive, and supply a bit of claustrophobic dread. My problem is that I kept comparing this movie to THE DESCENT, which is the classic of subterranean, monster horror. THE CAVE has it's moments, like when the explorers find themselves in deep water, unable to see what's swimming around their legs. Unfortunately, such tense scenes are few, giving way to more typical, hollywood action sequenses involving one or more of the male / female super-model cast. So, if you like explosions, flying cgi monstrosities, or super-models in peril, then THE CAVE is the perfect night's popcorn fiesta..."
3,extraterrestrial folklore,"An alluring thriller with an intimation of extraterrestrial along with immense CGI effects which have been nicely played down allowing the film to keep as much of a pragmatic atmosphere as possible. The Cave isn't really a movie with distinguished climatic plots and elevated dilemmas, but it's a clear-cut plot, with appealing diversity of characters and with some brilliant location shots and cinematography.It manages to hold your attention throughout the film, thus I give extra credit due to the fact that my imagination doesn't really dig the whole factor of Aliens, Goblins and Boogiemen.I guess the only downfall of the film is that it fails to embrace any unique quality of film elements and principles that could gain critically acclaimed recognition."
3,ok but not there yet,"This was an ok kind of movie, Love the concept but they could have did better on the directing and writting aspect..To me i think Cole Hauser is a very good actor and wish he start thinking before he picks his scirpts, he is the type of actor that people won't know how much talent he has until its too lateVery much still watchable but you can still try to enjoy it"
2,THE CAVE IN,so glad i missed this one in the theatre..save your money..this will be on the sci-fi channel every saturday soon
2,IT'S JUST OK RENTAL ONLY!,"I just rented this flick and watched it! ...Its kind of cheesy aliens/monster movie. Real poorly special effects when they want to go big seen story and scrip is lame. Only thing in this movie have attractive good looking cast. That's all about it. Is those kind of movie u see and forget fast!. Watch ""the aliens"" made 30 years ago, but a lot better special effects with great story and scrip. Skip this for sure or only rental, one time seen that's all about it. C+"
1,A CLAUSTROPHOBIC CATASTROPHE!,"One or two legitimate moments of suspense do not a thriller make, and anyway, the obtrusive and relentlessly cheery song and dance numbers make this play like a claustrophobic GUYS AND DOLLS."
1,Worst ever in my view.,"Wish I had paid more attention to the reviews before I bought this DVD. I consider myself somewhat of a seasoned sci-fi fan. With that in mind, I can honestly say this film 'ain't got it'! The plot is somewhat reasonable; however, there's certainly nothing new or exciting about the plot.If I could return the DVD for a refund I would do so."
3,Could Have Been So Much More,"This book was good but not great. It could have been so much more. The book is made up of a series of bullet points (e.g., ""The five-pointed star is a magical symbol linked with duration and time.""). The bullet points are followed by some explanatory material, but there is very little, if any, text that ties all of the points together to show their context and relevance. If this book had more prose that tied it all together, it would have easily deserved 5 stars. The book also has numerous factual and typographical errors. For example, the author calls the second president of the United States ""John Adam"" instead of ""John Adams"". The author also makes numerous references to things on the dollar bill, saying ""the seal on the right"", when it is really the seal on the left. This book needed a good editor! Overall, I enjoyed reading this book, but feel it missed the mark in key ways."
2,Fictional account,"More fiction than fact, in my opinion. Some interesting observations, however. I will not pass this one along to family."
1,Don't waste your time,"This is a very poorly written book, and I mean VERY. I can see where it might have had some potential in the hands of the right editor, but as it is, Ovason comes off looking like a chump. If I were him I'd be asking Harper Collins for my money back."
1,Not very enlightening,"Part historical documentary / commentary & part obvious design element breakdowns, this left me feeling as though the author put together a few colloqial bar stories about the dollar bill, googled the rest and cobbled it together in the least interesting thing I have read this year."
3,You get what you pay for,I bought the book because I wanted all the information I had come across about the Dollar bill in one accesable place. The information was interesting and there was a good history of those aspects covered. The format is rather encyclopedic rather than a readable book but easy to browse through all the same. BUT one of the areas I was interested in was the Owl hidden in the top Right hand courner but there was nothing and I found this disaapointing as it is a well known graphic hidden in the note
2,"Interesting. However, definitely not written from a ""scholastic"" viewpoint.","The Secret Symbols of the Dollar Bill by David Ovason was an interesting read for about 10 minutes. I did not ""purchase"" my copy rather it was in a ""bundled"" package with the DVD National Treasure from BJ's.I am glad that I received this book ""Free"", because it was not very ""scholastic"" and I would have been extremely disappointed and upset. I realize that National Treasure is a family movie. However, unlike the movie, this book cannot be understood and enjoyed on various levels.The Secret Symbols of the Dollar Bill is a picture book with some explainations. Granted, it does have some interesting facts and references. Perhaps, on a postive note, this book can be used as a reference for a 3-5th grader doing a mini-report on US Currency.My overall advice is: ""Unless you are purchasing this for a 5-8yr old child -- save your $$ and get this at the public library!!!""~FallenMoon"
3,Secret Symbols of the Dollar Bill,Learn all about the Occultic Jewish and Freemason symbols on the dollar bill. The slave owning Freemason scumbags that founded America have flaunted their planned new world order for centuries.
5,Buy this album if only for the tune: The Single Petal of a Rose,"I really dig Marcus Roberts. My first album of his was ""Alone with Three Giants."" A great album! Just Marcus on piano playing Ellington, Monk and Jelly Roll Morton tunes. This album pulls several Ellington tunes from that album. However, one tune on this album that was not on his ""Alone With Three Giants"" album is ""The Single Petal of a Rose."" Gorgeous! You must buy this album just for this tune! It stirs the soul. It is right up there with the Strayhorn tunes; Lotus Blossom, Day Dream and Blood Count (which can all be found on another great album ""And His Mother Called Him Bill,"" Ellington's tribute to Strayhorn)."
5,Brandon T.'s voice is always amazing.,"I can remember back awhile after the release of ""Get a Load of This"" by The Funky Butt Drum Club (brandon's former band) I went to see them at Ernie's Club Twang(periscope recs). AMAZING!!!! If you love TOLM you should do yourself the favor of listening to FBDC if you able to find it. I personally give this album a rating of 5 for the before mentioned reasons. Recording is clean, vocals are great, the music is fantastic, and a very overall fun feeling."
5,These guys are going places,"Knowing the guys from TOLM has nothing to do with how great I think this album is, it's just a perk. Brandon T. is a great talent as a singer/songwriter. Seeing him play solo is only topped by seeing the entire band jamming away on stage. I've recommended this cd to tons of people, and every single one of them has loved it. Can't wait to see this guys hit it big."
4,Very Interesting and Educational Novel,"""DK Biography : Abraham Lincoln"" was an interesting book. This book would do well for people that want to know a little more about Abraham Lincoln than most others. A nice thing is the book could be read from someone 1-100, and they would be interested. Actually, I caught my dad reading it one night. What made me like the book was how it was filled with those interesting little details and pictures your average Social Studies book wouldn't have. Like how Abe's home looked and how he built and other stuff like that. I also sadly disliked the book a little bit because some of the Abe's love-life paragraphs weren't really that interesting for boys, or even needed that much. Abraham Lincoln's story needs to be remembered and retold because he was a big reason slavery was abolished. This was a terrific biography."
3,Abraham Lincoln,"The book arrived quickly in great condition. However, I did not realize it was a simplistic biography written probably for the junior high level."
1,Don't expect this version to be anything like the original c,"If you've never seen the classic original of this book, with its wonderful illustrations, then perhaps you would not be as disappointed as I was when I got the re-written ""children's version"" with none of the original illustrations. There are occasional ""boxed"" texts that provide background material, but it's like taking a Beatrix Potter book (e.g., Peter Rabbit) and rewriting it-- it doesn't work. The original is beautifully written, the language is lyrical and the descriptions of the life and the veld take you right into the setting. This book is a poor substitute. If you can find it, get the original by Sir Percy Fitzpatrick and read it to your children when they are too young to read it themselves; then they can enjoy it on their own a few years later."
1,Not Like the Origional,"This book is a very big dissapointment after reading the origional Jock of the Bushveld by Percy Fitzpatrick. My son will be growing up on the origional book, not this one."
1,"This particular edition (Jonathan Ball Publishers, April 17, 2009)is a Disgrace and a Travesty","As other reviewers have stated, this is an awful and disgracefully edited, unforgivably PC version of the original - and it has lost a lot in the unskilful hacking it has been subjected to. DON'T BUY THIS EDITION! Go and look for a reprint of the original, or even a second hand copy - you'll be far better served than with his abomination."
1,Shocked by the sheer arrogance of the Politically Correct!!,"I read Jock of the Bushveld when I was a child, and loved it. It is a wonderful adventure story about a man and his beloved dog, an animal that eventually dies to save his master's life. It is on a par with ""Old Yeller"" and similar older stories that catch your heart forever. However, Jock is a TRUE story, depicting the life and culture of the time it happened. How Dare publishers summarily decide to PC up the story in order to make it more palateable to readers?! This is just total arrogance on their part. Why not re-write Shakespeare to make it less patriarchal or classist?! Jock is an original, true Story!!! Any publisher who dares to treat good literature in this way has obviously no respect or appreciation of the work of real authors... I guess the old saying.. "" Those who can, Do, and those who can't..."" imperiously desecrate the work of those who have talent.. because they who can't, don't... How utterly small-minded!"
5,Very good listening!,I remember hearing a few songs from this CD on Radio Free Virgin and thinking I must have this CD. This was back in 2001. Couldn't find it anywhere at that time. Finally found it here on Amazon. Excellent collection of music!
5,Dont let the sales rank fool you,"This album is great! If you are into the electronica, dance theme music, this it it. Ive been trying to find it everywhere, but very few stores sell it.All in all, this album is also a great value as it comes with 2 discs and both discs are filled with good songs that you wont have to skip through. Despite the sales rank of this title being 225,000 when I bought it, it is an excellent album.I would most definitely recommend this music."
5,The best Mascara!,"I have tried every mascara that has probably been made; from the low cost to very expensive and found this one to be the best. It goes on great and even - ample coverage without clumping (unless you keep caking it on) and adds a bit of curl to the lash. (I also use a warmed eyelash curler on my lashes after applying mascara) Whatever you do, do NOT buy the new Lancome mascara that is coming on the market for all in December that ""vibrates"" and is supposed to make for better lashes. It does not - one of my girlfriends tried that one against her mascara (one on each eye) and neither of us could tell which was which. Other than that I love a lot of Lancome products and use Clinique, Bare Minerals, and some other brands but Lancome Hypnose is definitely my pick for a great mascara!"
2,the motorcycle gathering,It shows Harley riders as a totaly different breed of motorcyclist. As a keen biker for over 35years i must say that i am slightly embarrased to say that i own a harley as most of the bikers in the dvd are plain show offs.There seems to be a large amount of credit card riders and not true bikers who ride for the shear enjoyment and freedom of the road.
2,Not worth it...,"This workout really isn't worth buying. It's three sets of just crunches. Which I already knew how to do on my own... I learned nothing new. And it's not much of a challenge. BUT, if you're a total beginner in working out & need motivation and a guy telling you ""GOOD! GOOD JOB!"" the whole time, then totally go for it. I'd recommend this dvd for older people who are out of shape.. like 35+ who just need a quick easy coach on standard crunches."
2,"For Beginner only, some serious stuff is missing","I bought this book because of the five star rating, and I need a good 8051 book for my project. I spend about two days to go over this book, and are quite disappointed with the depth of the book. If you just want to know the very basic application of 8051, it's probably ok although there are quite a few typos.There are three major flaws with this book:1. Most of the serious topics are touched very lightly; it's almost useless for a firware/hardware engineer. For example, the memory map and the handshaking application of 8255.2. Lots of trivial questions after each section, and each section is very short(again, nothing is really covered in details).3. Very weak index, try to find memory-map!I don't think the book deserves the price they ask for. I actually learned more from the 8051.com tutorial than from this book. The search for a good 8051 book is continued!!!"
2,Not very useful for real project!,"If you need to use 8051 in a work project, this is not the book for you. It's a not college level text, and the more advanced topics are either not covered or left as an exercise for readers. It's definitely not worth the price they charge."
1,Perhaps one star is too much,It appears that a lot of the contents were copied or gleened from other books.It is not much better than a data sheet.
3,This is boring...,"Department of treasury to buy crapy stamps! This should be redone into superman special delivery, takin all crap out on bonds n drunk uncle sam!"
3,Little disappointed in the amount of polarization,"This is a pretty good piece of glass but I would have hoped for a slightly stronger effect. I had a cheaper hoya CPL and it would polarize more noticeably but would also leave a much stronger gradient in the sky when shooting wide angle.Construction and build of the piece is solid and of quality. Maybe a slightly more expensive B+W would produce more results, B+W is supposed to be a fantastic manufacturer. I would recommend it, but just be aware that the polarizing effect it produces it subtle, which isn't necessarily a bad thing."
5,How wonderful and funny,"THis is a profound wonderful film set in Barcelona and following the hapless exploits of two cousins as they persue love and other interests in Europe. THe cousins couldn't be more different, one a reserved nerd obsessed with books on marketing and the other a swashbucking naval cadet proud of his country and disdainful of the foreigners. The best scene int he film is where a Spaniard says 'you americans kill to many people' and the cadet says 'no we are just better shots'. Other commentares abound as the american debates the left obsessed communists who complain about AMerica and spray paint 'OTAN is evil' on walls throughout the city. Definetly an enjoyable film for anyone who enjoyes europe but likes poking fun at how serious people take themselves."
2,Boring and weird,"The main characters are always at odds and one of them is so melodramatic that you kind of wish he would die somehow. Alas, he does not and instead spends the movie complaining about everything around him. This was supposed to have a love story but the focus wasn't there."
3,Thin plot -- Lame acting ...,"Two Americans reunite in Barcelona and pursue relationship with indigenous females. One is an expat working for a US Corporation; the other man is a Navy officer serving as an advance man for the fleet. They encounter much anti-American sentiment.The actors give their lines as though they were reading them. If this is a romantic comedy, I must confess I don't think I laughed once. I pulled this movie because it was compared favorably to the recent Woody Allen film, ""Vicky, Christie Barcelona."" I have not seen the latter film, but I'd recommend you take a ""pass"" at Barcelona."
2,Bore-celona,"The same people who created the ""No Man's Land"" trailer must have created the trailer for ""Barcelona""... making both look like they are filled with light-hearted fun when in actuality they are not. And I fell for it.But while ""No Man's Land"" has fleshed-out characters, comedic moments, and a message, ""Barcelona"" was filled with cardboard characters who every 50 minutes manage say something semi-witty. I kept waiting for it to get better but it was so painfully boring. I am thanking the gods that I did not purchase this movie and only rented it.How the Boston Globe, Phila. Inquirer, and S&E give this movie ""thumbs up"" is beyond me..."
5,a funny laid back romantic beautiful talk fest of a movie,"The comparisons to woody allen and kevin smith are valid, everyone likes to talk in this movie. Or at least the guys do. And that's the point. Two young, neurotic americans in laid back barcelona in the seventies. The spanish girls listen and nod and look at the guys like they're from another planet. This is a very sweet and very funny movie. Chris Eigeman has to be the most un-stereotypical military man ever presented in film. And Mira Sorvino never looked so beautiful. The scene where the guy spys on Mira and the other women learning a dance step is one of the most beautiful in all of film."
5,Captures the experience perfectly,"As an American who's lived on and off in Spain over the years, I can say the movie captures the cultural differences exactly! Spaniards and Americans are both similar and polar opposites at the same time, and the clash makes for a hilarious introspection into who and what we really are. Spend time in Spain and you will run into each one of these characters. Truely one of my favorite movies!"
3,Pizzarelli is a talent,"This cd was a bit of a disappointment. He has others that have more personality. I recommend Double Exposure, which he created his own version of famous songs as well as blending songs together."
4,Yu-gi-oh cards,"In this game I think that this game was tareted towards pre-adults and or adults. If getting into this game it would be good to get protecters, then your cards will not get damaged. to me this game is fun and great. it is also fun to trade with others and get stronger cards."
3,crock of poo-poo,"well for 1 yu-gi-oh DOES NOT I reapeat DOES NOT teach""santanism"" and so called ""black magic"" it is based on a child trying to save his grandfather from a evil duelist called pegasus,who has a item called a millenium eye,which gives him evil magial powers.yugi also posses a item called the milleinuim puzzle that is good not evil.so it's basicly good against evil.and now to the toy i bought it 4 my son and he really enjoyed it,but said he would rather play the tcg"
1,Teach your kids satanism & black magic,"PARENTS PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE watch this show with your kids before purchasing these or any other items related to Yu-Gi-Oh. I was shocked to discover just exactly what this show was when I watched it with my children. It is NOT a harmless copy of Pokemon. The characters and settings of this cartoon strongly resemble satainistic and black magic icons. I am not a strongly religious person, but I can not and will not allow this in my house.Please parents, before you buy these for your kids watch this show to decide whether or not you feel it is right for your children."
4,A True Life Saver,"I just finished reading ""Finding Your True Calling"". Up to now, I didn't think that most people understood what I was going through as someone who had just turned forty, is recently unemployed and possesses no real desire to go back to the same old grind. Until reading this book, I thought any chance of having a life and doing work that I really enjoyed had passed me by. Now, I know different. Though the book is really a collection of articles, the exercises and real-life accounts of people who have found the courage to leave the monetary security of their old jobs to live their lives persuing their dreams are thought provoking as well as inspiring. I recommend this book to anyone who is reluctant to live the life of their dreams or thinks it can't be done."
3,Okay....,"Content is valuable, but it's really just a bound computer print out. Poor packaging really. Not knowing what to do with your life is depressing enough. Receiving such a dreary-looking book you paid good money for doesn't really brighten your day. As I said, content is good, not life-changing, but good. It's probably worth $7."
2,Anthology,"I hasitated for some time before I ordered this book (the price). Then maybe because I expected something really special it didn't satisfy me a lot. It's just an anthology of various authors and exerptions from their most appealing works.So if you are taking your true calling seriously, the author that will bring you in deeper levels of your soul is Barbara Sher and her Wishcraft (its complete version is, by the way, available on the net free of charge). And the best explanation of the subject itself I have ever read is in Neal Donald Welsh's first book of Conversation With God. These two works really worth reading."
1,seriously...,This book is a mere compilation of several career help books. It is not even taking the best part of the each books.One could say it is a creative way to get your book published.
3,"not bad, but there's not much substance here","This is part of a three-book series that includes ""Zen Paths to Harmony"" and ""Zen Paths to Laughter."" It is a very short collection of (typically one-sentence) snippets of wisdom paired with black & white nature photographs. As I read through the book, I kept thinking that each page should be shrunk, laminated and reincarnated as a refrigerator magnet. The sayings are interesting although in my mind, not necessarily profound -- for example, one page quotes Abraham Maslow -- ""If our nature is permitted to guide our life, we grow healthy, fruitful and happy."" The facing page sports a photograph of a tomato. On the next spread, Carl Jung says ""The most terrifying thing is to accept oneself completely,"" and the accompanying (not particularly interesting) photograph is of a tree. This would make a cute gift or something to sit on a coffee table; I don't think that it would provide much more than a starting point for serious thought."
2,A basic intro...with some basic misunderstandings,"This book is a fairly good intro to stats, for someone looking for alternate explanations. HOWEVER, there are some glaring problems-- Philips does not understand significance testing, for example. This book should be taken with several grains of salt and used only as one of many supplemental texts."
4,"Helpful book, but bad printing","It's been about 20 years since I'd done any statistics, so I got the 5th edition from the library. It's a very good overview of the basic concepts.I purchased the 6th edition so I could have my own copy that I could write in, but I'm very unhappy with the book itself. It's printed on a cheap pulp paper that's so bad that any kind of marking (highlighter, ballpoint pen, etc.) bleeds through to the other side of the page. The binding is so weak I'm afraid to put it in a book holder. Overall, the quality is no better than a supermarket romance novel.What a shame, I'd have paid more for a quality book I could have kept on my reference shelf."
5,Worthwhile but poor print quality in this edition,"I had one of the earliest editions years ago, and decided to get the latest edition. Unfortunately, the various ""Boxes"" have a weird gray, streaky shading--reminiscent of what you get out of a 30-year-old photocopier at your library--rendering them hard to read.The book is still a great introduction and quite valuable if read before you take a class in the subject."
2,Book was overwhelming,"My wife & I have a new Tonkinese kitten - and I searched for the word Tonkinese and found this book. After I got it, I was disappointed with it. While I agree with one of the other reviews here about the author being enthusiastic, I felt way overwhelmed.It felt to me that this book was written more for a breeder than a ""regular cat owner"". It also felt like a ""reference"" book, more than a book you can just pick up and read.It was well put together, but for me, I felt it was way more than I needed. Also, for the size of the book, $31 is a bit steep (which was the price when I wrote this). Shouldn't have been more than $13 or $14, I felt."
2,Painful,"The tip of this baton looked exactly like the one I had 36 years ago when I was a majorette in high school. However, the dimples on each side of the shaft of the baton were so rough that they have actually cut me on several of my fingers. The batons that I twirled with years ago had smoothe dimples that would allow you to feel them and allow you to have a firm grip, but they would not stand up and cut you. If I hadn't already thrown away the packaging I would have sent this one back."
5,My second baton,"These batons are wonderfully made with hammered dimpled bands towards the top and bottom of the shaft. The texture adds a nice bit of visual appeal and also helped me learn two handed tosses.Like all the Star Line products, very well weighted. When you're ready to move up from the Starlet, this is a great starter professional baton with enough weight to help learn how to do some of the body spin tricks.Measure from armpit to fingertip length for sizing."
1,Horrible Picture Quality,"At such a cheep price(3 movies for under 10 bucks!)I was excited when I saw this in a store. But the buyer should definitely beware. Fans of Corman know how beutifully atmospheric his films are, but here the colors are faded out and blurry. The other B&W film are covered with spots and are very blurry,which is a shame because I don't know where to find these elsewhere. They looked like they would be a real treat for vintage horror lovers(especially with horror diva Barbara Steele)but the quality was so terrible I couldn't get through them. It's not just that they're not digitally remastered, but many scenes have a an ugly digital look(i.e. little squares every where.) My reccomedation is to buy Corman's classic Poe films on MGM's ""Midnight Movies,"" which are an excellant value and their gorgeous transfers do justice to the films."
4,Three for the Road,"Virtually everyone in Upper East Side and Los Angeles society makes a lavish appearance in at least one of these trio of novels from America's favorite chronicler of the very, very rich. Dunne has a sharp eye and a sharper pen while he takes us by the hand into the salons of those most privileged. He writes from the truth dipped in fine fiction and the result is brilliant, easy reading. His enduring theme throughout these fine novels is that in the end even the rich die too and they can't do a damn thing about it. If you're a reader of the grand and famous, or infamous, then this convenient book of all three novels is a must-have."
1,Poor Customer Service and inferior product design,Well then I suppose I can start by saying that this was my first ever Hamilton Beach product and last.... Construction of the food processor is weak and inferior. The blade broke after chopping vegetables for a pesto sauce I was making. It wasn't even a third full. So I called costumer service to get a new blade. They sent me one but it did not fit. Why? Because the change the design of the blade and also changed the design of the bowl. But I did not get the replacement bowl only the blade. So now I have to pay to get the new bowl. Yes you read it correctly. They would not send me the new designed bowl even under warranty. Their costumer service is a far cry from understanding customers with their issues. I don't think they even understand the English language. Save you money and buy something else... My is rendered useless...
4,Great!,I received this processor as a gift about a year and a half ago. I use it at least once a week. It's still working just like the day I got it. It does a great job. I haven't had any problems at all. And it is very easy to clean.
2,disappointing engineering,"This was a gift for my wife who had wanted a large capacity food processor. When she used it, it leaked liquid all around the sides since the liquid thrown up the sides went right through the seam between the top and the bowl, and bits of food were thrown up into the lid of the feed-tube where it was hard to get to and remove during cleaning. She was not happy with these two problems and was disappointed that the chopping mechanism was not more efficient. Ultimately, we returned it and bought a Kitchen Aid food processor instead"
2,Disapointing,The positive is the big mouth which certainly accomodates whole fruit and vegetables.The major negative is the speed. The lowest setting is much too fast and things like cheese clump. The blade sits too high to puree effectively.
2,i just dont like it,"Yes, it is huge and no, it's not too difficult to clean but keeping food upright in the chute and getting the machine to completely chop something is not possible. I'm a novice at food processors. This is my first but if they are all like this I don't see the point in having one. Actually, I would be willing to donate it to our thrift shop if I knew which one to buy to replace it without having the same problems."
5,Even a caveman can do it!,"This product has nice big open spaces so its' really easy to clean up all parts when finished, and the unit itself is not complicated..Love it.."
4,food processor,Sure is nice not having to cut itemsup to fit in the unitjust throw them in wholelove it
3,"lots of power, but poorly designed","I got this large food processor when my smaller Hamilton Beach processor finally died after a long life of shredding frozen cheese (among other things). I love the huge mouth and large bowl, but it seems to have been designed very poorly. First off, it is VERY tall, it fits under my cabinets but just barely- and I have high cabinets. Secondly, there is too much room beteween the blade and the lid of the processor which means large portions of everything you try to shred or slice gets stuck in the top and is wasted. Unfortunatly, I have found that most food processors have severe design flaws such as these. At least the blades are sharp and the price is a lot lower than other brands. Because of the large bowl it's great for making pie crust, biscuits, etc. If you chop a lot more than shred I say go for it. If not, you might want to check out other models."
5,Commercial use of a home food processor.,"This is my second BigMouth Processor, in as many years. They are the bestfood processor for the cost. I run a BBQ stand. I put a heavy demand on a processor daily. I use it in preparing every side that I offer. Shredding cabbage for cole slaw, is probably the heaviest strain on the moter and drive train, and it performs wonderfully. I can not say enough about the power of this unit. The only complaint I have about this unit, is the unavailability of replacement parts, such as a replacement bowl. The powerful motor has years of life left, but I had to replace the entire unit, because I couldn't get a replacement bowl.David W. Camp (Owner/operator Hogleg BBQ)"
5,Love my processor!,I got the Big Mouth Food Processor for myself and I loved it so much I got 2 more (one for each of my daughters). If you are looking for a great food processor and want a super price then you could not go wrong with this one.
3,parts are costly and not easily available,"i have used HB food procesor. I broke the s shaped blade.My exp is parts are costly and not easily available......Also , while shredding , food gets stuck between top and the jar.Otherwise ok."
1,VERY DISAPPOINTED~!!!,"I PURCHASED MY PROCESSOR ABOUT 10MO. AGO...AFTER SEVERAL WASHINGS WITH THE BLADES ETC. THEY STARTED TO BECOME REALLY RUSTED AND SMELLED BAD...YES, I DID DRY THEM COMPLETELY-THEY JUST ENDED UP RUSTED WITH THAT SMELL AFTER SOME TIME...I EMAILED THE COMPANY FOR A REPLACEMENT OF SOME KIND, THEY TOLD ME I NEEDED TO BRING IT BACK TO THE STORE I PURCHASED IT FROM...THE STORE ONLY ALLOWS RETURNS UP TO 90 DAYS...I ENDED UP THROWING THIS PRODUCT AWAY...I WILL NEVER GET ANOTHER PRODUCT FROM HAMILTON AGAIN...NOW I HAVE A KITCHENAID AND THE PARTS ARE REPLACEABLE AND THEY WILL GUARANTEE THEIR WARRANTIES LIKE NO OTHER...PERSONALLY RECOMMEND ""NOT"" TO PURCHASE THIS ITEM-$$$ WASTED!!!"
1,Died after just a few uses,Died after just a few uses and did it while mixing flour with salt of all things!Also blades got duller after just the first couple uses. One could tell that this was an inferior product by how thin the blade metal was. Definitely do not recommend.
2,What a mess!,"I have had this food processor for a couple of years, and found it difficult to use, hard to clean and impractical. It is very hard to get it closed properly to operate it, and the suction cup feet make it next to impossible to move once you've got it placed somewhere. The lid stayed dirty, even after the dishwasher, and eventually broke. I do not recommend this model at all... go with Kitchenaid."
2,not as I expected,"I bought this food processor because it had a large capacity, which I needed, but the engineering and design of this product leaves alot to be desired. The first usage surprised me because all of the liquid inside splashed up and began to run down the outside of the container. I have decided to add liquids last, but there are several other downsides to this food processor. The splashing of what is being chopped in the bowl sends food up into the upper lid, where it lodges and is hard to remove. Chopping is uneven and there seems to be no way to get all things chopped evenly, whether layered on top or the bottom. Although this is called ""Big Mouth"", it is hard to add large things through the food chute since the opening to the chute is smaller than the chute itself. In order to load the 'big mouth' you have to open the top, which automatically shuts off the food processor. What a disappointment this machine was!"
4,Processor review,It works great so far. I m finding it powerful and easy to put together. My complaint would be the size of it. I put it back in the box and store it in the porch. I was surprised at the size.I fixed pesto and slaw with it so far. Love it! Would recommend it.
5,Very satisfied,"I bought this food processor to replace an old Hamilton Beach food processor. There have been some nice improvements in the decade since I bought the old one. First, this is much quieter than the old one. Second it cleans up easier than the old one, and third the mouth size can be adjusted which is really nice when you want to slide potatoes first and then celery."
3,Could have been 5 stars,"This would be the perfect food processor except for two things. First, the one inch gap above the slicer/grater blade means you lose the last inch of every food you put in for slicing. Second, the extra strong suction cup feet make it next to impossible to move. If you have a permanent space for this appliance on your kitchen counter, that could be a plus because they do hold it firmly in place. If you can live with these two shortcomings, then I certainly recommend this processor. Otherwise, you should keep shopping."
5,LOVE IT!,I have had this for about a year now and I still LOVE it. It can handle most food without having to cut it up first! I have dropped an entire steak in it with some chili seasonings and pulsed it a few times with perfect chili meat results. It's just a bonus that it mixes the spices into the ground meat so nicely! (I have also used left over roasts without having to cut it into pieces)I make hummus all the time in it as well. Takes about 5 minutes.There are so many uses for it!
5,Great machine for a super price,"The Hamilton Beach Big Mouth Food Processor is wonderful. We are raw foodists and use this machine at least twice a day. It is easy to use, pretty quiet, doesn't walk all over the counter because of suction cup feet, easy to clean. The large mouth makes it so easy to just about anything in the processor, too.This is a very hardy machine and does a super job. It is a tall machine, so if your cabinets won't adjust it may be a problem."
4,Consumer Opinion,"I think it could be built better, more durable. Also, I could have gotten it about $10-15 cheaper at Wal-Mart."
5,"Soothing, Peaceful, Emotional Music","I found this album in a small record shop off the Avenida Paulista in Sao Paulo in 2003, while looking for quiet bossa guitar classics. The sound quality is amazing, each chord plucked clean ans the timbre full and rich. Each song has its distinct flavor, yet the songs segue smoothly into each other. Baden Powell is a true guitar genius. The music has never failed to calm, soothe and put us in a tranquil, relaxed mood especially after a rough day, the same way Kind of Blue does. When Ezra gave birth to our baby Jakob we put this on in the labor and delivery room, and the hospital staff all mentioned how great it was and asked for the artist and album information, intending to get their copies, from the doctor, anesthesiologist, to the nurses! At any rate, it worked like magic and my wife had a very easy delivery!"
5,"Based on the late, great Eddie Bunker's novel",Simply put: one of the finest crime flicks ever made. Hoffman never better. Eddie Bunker has a cameo in it.Check it out.Isn't it about time they put this gem out on DVD?
5,classic dustin hoffman,Beautifully acted by Dustin Hoffman as a con released from prison after 10 years and is now trying to go straight against all obstacles. Revenge comes into play here as well in this fast paced film.
4,From a book by Mr Blue,"A very good hardboiled crime movie with an excellent cast -Harry Dean Stanton and M. Emmett Walsh are sublime as always- but an important fact for crime fiction fans not mentioned by other rewviewers is that this is the movie of the outstanding crime novel by Edward Bunker 'No Beast So Fierce'. Bunker of course was a real criminal before becoming a Hollywood advisor on films like 'Heat' (in which Jon Voight played a character who looked like Bunker) not to mention his acting role as Mr Blue in 'Reservoir Dogs'. If you've seen the film, read the book, if you've read the book, the film is well worth watching too. But where is the DVD edition ?"
5,great criminal-character study.,"Where to start......i remember my 1st viewing and i was shocked by all the great secondary roles. Harry dean stanton,m emmet walsh,kathy bates and gary busey(and his son playing his son)in their 1st film roles. I don't include theresa russell because she is'nt in the same league. Written by eddie bunker(reservoir dogs) and directed by ulu grosbard(last exit to brooklyn) it's an unflinching look at the everyday life of a career criminal.The camera meanders and ponders these questions at a smooth pace. If you think this is slow,then you can't appreciate why 70's films were so great.No big explosions or gunfights,just great storytelling.I almost forgot.....(my opinion),dustin hoffman's greatest performance ever. Harry dean stanton is a revelation."
3,Good Information But Too Much Filler,"This book contains some very good information for arbitrators, but the last 200 pages (almost half of the book) is just checklists derived from the table of contents and the rules of various arbitration associations which are available on the internet for free. The substance of the book is written in chronological order of the arbitration process and is geared more to the experienced arbitrator than a beginner. I found Allan H. Goodman's Basic Skills for the New Arbitrator (make sure you get the new second edition) to be a more concise, practical treatment of the same subject for beginners and valuable even for experienced arbitrators. Written in question-and-answer format, it teaches you rather than talks to you."
5,ITS 1980 & I JUST PLUGGED IN MY KORG KEYBOARD!!,"WHY THIS BAND ARENT WELL BIGGER THAN THEY ARE IS A MYSTERY, I CAME ACROSS THIS BY ACCIDENT BUT IT WAS AN ACCIDENT I ENJOYED!! anyway the cd is a melting pot of 70/80S new wave,early ELVIS COSTELLO & early SQUEEZE,the confusing thing is that this music is being lourded by some of the punk scene at the moment and bands such as THE STEREO, REGGIE & THE FULL EFFECT & THE GET UP KIDS are getting all the limelight ...buy this and lets see this band get the attention THEY DESERVE ...now wheres that adapter gone?"
2,grief reef,"post elementary punk with something that HAPPENS lateron cheap,and rough.LIKE the heavenly beat that seduces electronic w\ electric in a sharper imagery.SUPPOSEDLY you cant retrieve those sounds better than you can see them!blisteringly better than the last time..."
4,1313 Dead End Drive: A Review,"This game is really fun but you can get tired of it soon. I have played it about 10 times and I'm not tired of it yet. It just dependsa on what makes you bored. If you like a GOOD mystery, this game isn't what you are looking for though. It really has no MYSTERY to it. It is just traveling the house trying not to get out. I give this game about 2 1/2 stars for the amount of mystery. 4 stars for the fun because, like I said, you can get tired of it really soon. 3 stars for durability because a lot of the peices are made out of cardboard and the ends will split really easily. 2 stars for educational value because the only thing that it really teaches you is to be a good sport."
3,Ok for Under 12,"This game was an OK game. I bought it so my 10 year old could have a game to play with the rest of the family. He thought it was fun but the rest of the family were bored with it. The one rule that allows you to go into the same space more than once on a turn causes the game to be less exciting than if that were not allowed. Over all, I would say this is an average game, no better than some, no worse than others."
2,Not worth the trouble.,"I got this game for my nephew who had just turned 8. It has been taken out the box only once. It was very difficult and time consuming to put together and then rather difficult to play. He did okay with it, but his little sister, age 5, was unable to play at all. I would not reccomend this game for the mentioned age groups, maybe 10 and up."
2,Not so good,We searched high and low for this game. When we finally found it here I was disappointed in it. It is hard for the kids to understand and play. Not a purchase I would recommend.
3,Cool game,"This game was pretty cool, but it took a little to long and a little too much work to set up for a game. It was ok because it was fun just to make people fall into fireplaces (yhats the only reason i gave it a 3) I just didn't get the point that much."
4,Cool game,"The whole plot of this game is to get out of the creepy house with your aunt's inheiritance.But of course, who is there to stop you?Your other relatives and revolving fireplaces,falling suits of armor, and other traps too!1313 Dead End Drive is a really cool game!"
4,Dead End Drive -- a Board Game for Everyone,"7-10 year old boys in our neighborhood have been seen playing this rather than a video game. Wow, what an endorsement. Even my husband likes it. Takes some strategy."
4,Fun Game,"This is a really fun game but its very hard to assemble and its confusing at first, but still fun."
4,TEXAS HILL COUNTRY,"I share the authors love of the Hill Country and yeah like the review below said the authors view is utopic, but ive spent lots of time in the hill country and frankly it is simply perfect, well maybe not San Ynez Valley perfect, but close to it. The images are quite good, though some just dont really capture my vision of the Hill country, but most are very representative. Brousing this book will make anybody dream of a long drive through the hilly, bluebonnet strewn landscape that is Texas' iconic Hill Country; how's that for utopia."
2,A BIG book with little to offer,"I purchased this rather expensive ""coffee table"" book with the hope of receiving an idealized photo-documentary of the Hill Country (at least, more than what I already know). I got a big book with lots of mundane landscape scenes - many shrouded in fog and cloud cover. Sort of like battlefield pictures long after a war ended.The narrative was short and basically a flashback of the writer's utopic vision of the Hill Country set against the current status quo. Not the kind of story that inspires you to rush to Central Texas and explore."
5,Good addition to non playmobil playsets as well,"When I first saw this set I knew I had to get it for my daughter because it's way too awesome to pass up. She doesnt have many Playmobil toys and doesnt care for the people in the sets but instead enjoys the chickens and coop with her Calico Critters family. The size is close enough to scale for the Calico Critters and I imagine would be good for many other play houses as well. This isnt the easiest playmobil set to find on the internet, so be sure to snatch it up when you can. If you have never purchased Playmobil before, it would be good to know mostly all sets have really tiny pieces and some can even be fragile, they arent recommended for small children."
4,Playmobil Chicken Coop,"Ordered this for my grandson's 5th birthday. He enjoys playing with it, but the chickens are quite small compared to what I thought he would be getting. This was ordered through Amazon.com, but was shipped from the UK. After I clicked on to send my order, it said that it would take until almost Christmas to get here, and I had ordered it the first of November. My grandson was thrilled when I opened what I thought was another package I had ordered and he ""found"" chickens. It had arrived in less than two weeks!"
5,CHICKEN COUP,I HAVE BOUGHT THIS HEN HOUSE AND CHICKENS FOR MY GRANDSON BECAUSE I HAVE REAL ONES SO i THINK IT IS GREAT FUN FOR US BOTH!!!
4,Cute toy,"Cute set, my 5 year old son loved it. Only drawback is very small pieces, but that seems to be the case with all Playmobile sets."
5,Lots of fun on the farm!,"The Easter Bunny brought this set for our daughter for Spring. She has had lots of imaginative play with this toy. She collects eggs from the coop, has the chicks follow the mama hen, and even sets the rooster out on a fence to wake up the girl to come start her work! Too cute! Just keep in mind the toys are tiny and not recommended for households with small children who may mouth the toys. They are a chocking/swallowing hazard."
4,MOTIVATION,"The tempo never changes throughout the whole cd. Some of the cadences are a little corny. But I have to attribute my whole aerobic existence to this cd. You can't quit, the other guys will look down on you, especially your first sargeant! You picture yourself with the group, all of you feeling the same pain. Next thing you know, you look up and you're 3 miles down the road! I've asked for more cd's for Christmas, I've about got this one memorized."
3,"Slightly dated, but interesting concept","This is a book about the latest stealth bomber. It is also a book about nuclear winter. The author presents the idea that nuclear winter may not be as bad as originally thought. As the story develops, the idea of the US launching a first strike against Russia is believable.Anyway, this is ok. Not great, but not bad either."
3,Smaller than I thought.,"I had the choice of ""small"" jackets or jackets. I bought the jackets thinking there were regular sized and I could get my pearls to seat in them. They ended up being too small for the pearl size I would use in them, so I gave them to my little niece. Perfect for a little girl, not perfect for a big girl ;-D."
5,Great Book for Mangagers of 9-10 year olds,"I had been looking for a book on how to conduct practices with 9-10 year old players. This book's title was ""perfect"". It outlined my first 5 practices and gave me precise instructions on how and when to conduct each drill. I consider myself a knowledgeable baseball guy but always had trouble on what drills to run for this age group. This book gives easy to understand detail of each drill with diagrams when needed.I have just completed my fifth practice and have had parents of the players come up to me and tell me that they think my practice and drills are great. I owe it all to this book.The twinkie eating contest at the end of the first practice was a player favorite. Also, as a graduate of Eastern Illinois University, I was pleasantly surprised to see that the author was from Charleston, IL."
4,great little book,"I've been coaching youth baseball for several years now. I got this book at the start of the 9-10 yr. group winter ball season. It has some great ideas on how to manage and run the practices and interact with the families. It has some really good drills that the kids like to complete. Not much on specific mechanics and skills, e.g. you won't find how to teach a kid to pitch, or what specifically to look for in a struggling batter. If you're a little nervous about moving up a level, or how to fill up your first several pracices, I recommend this book."
3,"It's Okay for Young Kids, but There Are Other Books Too","This is a fine, middle-of-the road book on coaching kids. It's especially aimed at coaches of 8 to 10 year-old teams. After reading all the 5-star reviews, I was expecting a tour-d-force and this book, while valuable, simply is not that special.It has some interesting drills for young players, but is devoid of any real baseball skills descriptions. The book focuses on the basic throwing, catching, and hitting skills. It all flows together if you're a post-Tball and pre-skilled-play coach. It does have some handy cut-out diagrams and a very good bibliography.This book also has some good tips for dealing with parents. However Dr.Fortanasce's ""Life Lessons from Little League"" is a much better book on a coach's relationships with his players and their parents. Similarly, Ripkin, Bouroughs, Cluck, Kendall, Voorheis and others all have more in-depth books on baseball skills.Check out Amazon and look at the wide range of coaching books available."
3,I was exactly what I was expecting,This game is not nearly as bad as all of you say it was. The controls were the same as they were in the first Getaway. The story had the same feel as the original getaway. It did add some cool cars and i like that they added motorcycles and other 2 wheeled vehicles ( a bicycle). I got this game for 22 bucks at gamestop used and I dont feel ripped off at all. I feel i got exactly what i payed for.
2,IF THIS WERE A REPORTCARD.......NEEDS IMPROVEMENT,YOU MEAN TO TELL ME THAT I WAITED FOR THIS.....I COULD HAVE BOUGHT THE OLD GETAWAY FOR ALOT CHEAPER!!!!
3,Great Game if you liked the original...,"Graphics are awesome, and London is very well done (if you've ever been there). The problem with this game is in the difficulty setting...the ""combat"" portions are VERY easy, IF you can drive to get there...once again, no maps..vehicles handle very poorly, with lots of obstacles. This game could have been great with the addition of difficulty setting, or a some adjustments in the driving aspect...fun game, but not the next Grand Theft Auto."
2,"Decent, but didn't live up to expectations","I loved the first Getaway and was very skeptical of all the bad reviews I'd been seeing. Unfortunately, many of them are correct. I just got Black Monday a few days ago and its already quickly losing much of my interest. While the first Getaway was gritty and griping, the sequel is comparably bland. The story in the first was simple and made sense without getting too complicated, but in Black Monday I often don't know or don't care why the characters are being asked to do certain missions (much of this has to do with the fact that the interlude movies are annoyingly long). There are a few upgrades - you can ride a motorcycle, etc - but these really seem like minor issues. The game is also too easy. Its too bad - I was looking forward to Black Monday. My advice: if you really want to play it wait a few wait a few months until you can buy a cheap used version. At least you won't feel too let down this way."
5,Don't know about Jack... but O'Toole IS God!,"This wicked, hilarious and original piece of filmmaking could be the wildest British movie ever made as it boldly goes... in all directions, milking Barnes' brilliant idea for all its comedic worth : as long as poor (actually filthy rich) Jack believes he's God, his relatives want to commit him -- but when he turns into a killer, they start adoring him as he takes his place in high society.While I don't know about Jack, I firmly believe that Peter O'Toole IS God. If his audacious and mesmerizing performance wasn't reason enough to want to own that DVD, the Criterion edition is a MUST since it offers a delightful commentary by the 3 Peters which is both insightful and funny -- you even get to hear O'Toole's inimitable laughter. Hours and hours of bliss."
4,"the brother of Sherlock Holmes!, you illeterate oaf!","wow, this is quite honestly the weirdest(not to be confused with strange, that is reserve for clockwork orange) movie i have ever seen, and ive seen some weird ones, but nevertheless, very very funny but make sure you dont have some apahty for dark british humor, imean honeslty its a fanstatic film and hsa some great songs(everybody do the varsity slag!) its very very pricey though, so keep in mind to have an open mind nad very liking to british humor, i am very proud it is in my collection though, deffinatly worth price"
2,comedy that turns to incestuous murder?,"This movie doesn't know what it's own genre is. It's a silly romp for over 2 hours, then suddenly becomes a dark comedy.If it weren't for Alistair Sim's brilliance, I'd have turned this off several times. Every scene with Sim is magical and original.Putting aside all the weird 70s crumminess, it's hard to warm up to characters with awful wigs spewing Shakespearean-like nonsense from the get-go. We don't even meet our ""beloved"" lead character until about 25 minutes into the ""story.""The murder that happens is not only out of place in this film, but it's AFTER the entire movie should end! It should climax & paste ""THE END"" on the screen about 10 minutes before it turns murderous.If you like psychedelic 70s nonsense & over-the-top performances by great actors stooping to unfunny stupidity, you'll love this. I love Peter O'Toole, but not in this. I'd rather watch him for 4 hours in Lawrence of Arabia than for even 1 hour in this thing."
4,What A Wimpy Peter O'Toole Performance!,"My local video store cut out the entire ""Jack the Ripper"" skit and made it so the credits would appear superimposed over a frozen picture of Jesus saying, ""My name is Jack..."" Peter O'Toole did a rather wimpy performance as Jesus Christ, the 14th Earl of Gurney (if I'm allowed to put it that way)."
1,"Pretensions, Not Class","""The Ruling Class"" is a disappointingly pretentious attempt at satire. There isn't a moment of truth, humor, or subtlety in this overlong, airless film. Nothing elicits a laugh or even a smile (not even the esteemed Alastair Sim stuttering away during the heavy-handed marriage scene). One might have expected some sense of satiric humor from the country that gave us ""Kind Hearts and Coronets"", ""The Ladykillers"", ""A Shot in the Dark"", and ""A Hard Day's Night"", but ""The Ruling Class"" just lays a big, self-important egg."
1,Stay Away,"This movie is described as a black comedy. While it is certainly very ""black"", over the top in my estimation, I found little humor in it. The movie makes its point that the Britsh upper class is an arrogant, witless, self-serving, immoral group in the first ten minutes and continues to heavy-handedly beat us over the head with this for the next two plus hours. In the meantime, Peter O'Toole chews up the scenery as the schizophrenic black sheep heir of the family estate who initially believes he is Jesus Christ and is then ""cured"" and believes he is Jack the Ripper.In order to be funny there should be some shred of connection of reality that you can relate to the situation portrayed in the film.I found this film to be absurd and humorless."
4,BETTER JESUS THAN JACK - WWJD?,"Jack may be an English Lord, but he's clearly nuts: he thinks he's Jesus Christ. And then he's ""cured"" and comes to believe that he is in fact Jack the Ripper. Peter Medak directs and Peter O'Toole stars in ""THE RULING CLASS,"" an irreverent and hysterical black comedy from 1972 based on the notorious play by Peter Barnes. A truly outrageous film of ideas both caustic and urbane. The three brilliant Peters share the incredibly funny and insightful commentary track. This is the 154 minute director's cut. Cool extras include Medak's home movies shot during production. An esteemed cult classic that still delivers."
3,Spaced-out British satire that is right on target.,"Hilarious fun is poked at the eccentric British upper-class in this no holds barred satire. Peter O'Toole is memorable as the mad Earl of Gurney who believes that he is Jesus Christ and when restored to ""normalcy"" turns into Jack the Ripper.Characters at various times take to madcap songs. The aristocracy, it seems would rather welcome a Jack the Ripper or an extremely reactionary lord than it would Christ. With Alistair Sim as a feeble-minded Bishop and Arthur Lowe as a hilariously insolent, left wing ""Bolshie"" manservant. 3 1/2 stars."
5,Very Impressive,This is truly an amazing CD. The track As the World Burns is a must listen and a great song to kick off this solid album. The solo work on Black Masaquerade is air guitar worthy. City of Peace and Time is All We Need really showcase the brilliant song writing of Yan Leviathan. This is an album that will be timeless and is one the best debut efforts I have ever heard. I look forward to enjoying future projects from this band and seeing them on tour (must come to Phoenix!). Keep up the great work!
5,This on my TOP 10 for 2005,"OH MAN!!!!!! There is really no way to describe this CD. When i first heard that LANCE KING was doing the vocals i had to have it. ONCE i got it I couldn't stop playing it. This is one heck of a cd, Power, Progressive Old School my type of music. The vocals of LANCE KING once again prove to the metal worl he is the best metal singer out there. He sing with passion, and from his heart, he puts every ounce of his being into every song. LANCE YOU RULE my friend. Dave Elfeson from MEGADEATH plays bass and drives the rythm section of this band. Then there is YAN, YAN my friend YOU RULE. And newcomer Jonah Weintgarden on keyboards, he is also the keyboardist for PYRAMAZE and LILITU, and he is awesome. Is this a CD i recommend? YOU BET IT IS. Go out and buy it today and you won't be disappointed. IT IS AWESOME. Also check out PYRAMAZE and ASCENSION THEORY, MANTICORA, SHINING STAR, and WARMACHINE."
2,Horrible Production,"I bought this CD hoping the production was better than the amazon samples.But no, This CD has horrible production, sounds muddy and cheap. Very disappointing CD.Sorry I can't give this anymore than 2 stars."
4,Pretty Good,"This is a pretty good album. The only thing the songs all sort of blend toghether, that being good or bad depending on your tastes. This sounds like 80's power metal, but nowadays anything that doesn't sound cookie cutter get's an A in my book."
2,Don't Waste Your Money,"There is nothing in this book you can't learn by doing a little research on the web. If your child is having a ""pooping problem"" I recommend trying ""It Hurts When I Poop, a Story for Children Who Are Scared to Use the Potty"". I bought this for my daughter and it worked like magic!"
4,book review,this book was very helpful outlining the important aspects of bladder and bowel problems and how to overcome them. It was very helpful.
2,Enough material for a good article,"I wanted to like this book, but:It's a very simplistic idea - Speak like a human not a jargon-addled automaton and people will like you and understand you better. Basically, if you read the first chapter, you've read the book.I had hoped that there would be some actual research or references to research that supports a lot of the opinions the authors put forward. I was disappointed. Their own research sounds really thin and designed to prove a foregone conclusion rather than really shed light on the subject. And there was little in terms of linking to meaningful, objective research.The examples they gave of what they consider good communication versus idiotic business-speak weren't very clear, fair or convincing.I also felt like the tone of the writing and the read were pretty vindictive and self-righteous rather than helpful. I actually started to feel sorry for the ""idiots"" they are ripping on.Conclusion: ""truthy"" ramblings galore, but no real news here."
1,Only Got halfway through,I only got halfway through this disk. It made its point early on and kept going on and on about it. It tried too hard to convince and had too little on solutions. I know some people proactively seek synergies and other stuff like that. I was hoping for a more practical applicable solution.
2,Utter twaddle - commits all the sins it attacks,"I bought the audio version of this book on the basis it would make the points more forcefully and concisely in helping me understand and apply (a great example being the four CD of ""Execution - the discipline of getting things done"" being my best prior example).The reader Alan Sklar tries manfully to try and bring it all alive, but the core issue is the raw data of the words and story is not that great or well written - I actually found aftre one CD I was getting very bored and despite many attempts to dip in subsequently, found the whole thing very tedious and boring which is exactly what was not hoped for given the title.I did not find myself learning much that would help me ultimately in my job, which is a shame as the subject is very relevant to what I do."
2,Borrow it from the library,"This is one of those books that make me wish authors could publish 20-page books and sell them for $1. Twenty pages is probably all that was needed to convey the thoughts in this book, especially if you've read any communication books previously. Also, the authors seem kind of arrogant and general. (P.S. I don't think they are quite as funny as they apparently do.) So I would suggest that you go to the library and leaf through it, rather than buying it and reading the whole thing. (I got the CD from my library.) My favorite communications author is Deborah Tannen."
2,So what? Tell your readers the HOW,"Does it really matter why business speakers give poor presentations? Get to the action quickly and the why is irrelevant. Persuasion is most effective when the speaker focuses on the new way of doing things and avoids any comparison to the old way. Readers searching for better presentation skills will remember new and better presentation techniques by learning them, not by having the bad old ways rehashed again and again.Please read books with actual action steps, not theory, and you'll be a business speaker who doesn't speak like an idiot."
5,Should not be unknown...,"Anyone who likes wildly creative, original, and atmospheric music should scoop this up. Delightfully off-beat and unlike anything else, but I think classical music aficionados would appreciate it as much as would admirers of new age, rock, or industrial. ""And if I fall"" is a particular favorite."
4,My boys LOVE this dragon!,My boys (5+8) played this game at acommunity center and fell in love with it. When it came time to buy a Christmas present for my nephews (7+10) I immediately thought of this. They adored it. If your kids - boys OR girls - are into dragons and crystals this is great fun. Your character needs to enter the dragon's cave and steel crystals(1 at a time) but when your opponent rolls a certain color he gets to turn on the dragon and the mechancial dragon that sits in the center of the board with the long snakey neck whips around and could knock your crystal out of your hands sending you to find another. The first player to get a crystal of each color gets a chance to go back in for the golden dragon eggs. If successful - he's the winner! The kids just love the random element of the dragon and his windy neck and roaring sounds.
5,Love the dragon!!,Even without the board game its worth the money just to play with the dragon! it has a huge neck! and sways with very very lifelike snake motions!love everything about it!!
1,Big disappointment,"Shipped this to our grandson who is crazy for Dragons for Christmas. Opens it, puts in batteries and NOTHING happened.BIG DISAPPOINTMENT FOR GRANDSON, BIGGER DISAPPOINTMENT TO GRANDMA & GRANDPA."
4,My son loves the dragon,"I just got this toy today. My three and half years old son keeps saying: cool, this is so cool while I was opening it. He is too young to understand the rule. But it is ok, the moving dragon is good enough for fun."
3,Two out of three ain't bad.,"There's always a risk when purchasing bargain basement DVDs. More often than not, you end up with scratchy, faded old prints and distorted soundtracks which make them hardly a bargain. However, there are some rare exceptions. Case in point, this DVD, which I bought primarily for Horror Hotel and was not disappointed. Apart from a few minor scratches, the film looks and sounds great, with nice contrast levels and a widescreen transfer to boot. Fans of the Vincent Price classic, House on Haunted Hill, will also be pleased. Both picture and sound quality are very good and it's widescreen as well. Alas, there's the ugly duckling of the bunch, Little Shop of Horrors, a scratched up, badly faded, full frame mess! Since I've never much cared for this film anyhow, it's not a big deal to me. In other words, depending on which films interest you in this package, you may or may not be satisfied."
4,"Has everything, great stuff--but not for beginners; rather it's for somewhat-competent organists, we think.","Not highly complex, but not beginner stuff. Advises on various pipe settings, for instance. Due to the large number of excellent pieces--you'll know all the melodies and titles--get it and work it up and you'll get better and will enjoy it."
5,full of so much romance you'll fall in love with the book,"CERISSA!Wow! it's such a great book filled with all emotions, Ms.St.Claire does a fabulous job writing this one. Cerissa is a heart-capturing book. Packed with action, jealousy, and a neverending quest. Each page will take you on a journey so great you'll want to read this book over and over again! This book is certaintly worth every dime you pay for it!!!"
1,"Terrible, Terrible book","I have read every Forgotten Realms novel ever published. I have enjoyed almost every one of them. I don't think I have ever disliked a book this much in my life. This is the only book I have ever started that I haven't finished.There is very little plot to this story, the characters could be found in any book, and the setting is just plain terrible.If you choose to read this book, have a pillow close by as you will surely fall asleep."
2,Worth reading only for geographical insights.,This is the kind of book that only Forgotten Realms enthusiasts who HAVE to read ALL the FR books would read. Anyone else not totally obsessed should stay away.
1,A great tragedy!,"I have one thing to say. Wizards of the Coast is destroying what TSR built!A note on this book in particular. The author shows little imagination in the plot of this novel. Also, the details in this novel are far removed from the normal Forgotten Realms novels (lasers...comon!). This may be a passable novel on its own; however it is far from a good Forgotten Realms fantasy."
4,A fun ride,"It wasn't quite what I expected from a forgotten realms novel. Thing happend in a tiny place of no outside importance. A place with strange, pompous, and sometimes rididculous rules of warfare.This book is hilarious. The vast majority of the book wil make you laugh. But along the way characters are developed. Make no mistake, there is a story here. There is drama, characterization, and plot, but humor underlies them all."
2,Yech! What was that and what did it leave in my mouth?,"Ugh! What a waste of time. My usual 2 day read was elongated into a 3 weeker. I left this book in the bathroom to skim through during my daily constitutionals. It wasn't worth being in any other room. Boring story, boring characters, almost invisible cast of thousands, with no face and no name supporting an equally invisable storyline. It was almost as if these cities were all bubbled up and kept away from the rest of Forgotten Realms."
1,Worst book I ever read,"I read all of the Realms novels. I now wish I didn't. This was without a doubt the worst book I have ever opened. Where most books take me one or two days to read, I was reading this one for over a month. It almost made me wish I was illiterate by the end of it. The plot (if you can call it that) is slow to get moving, and the characters are more boring than watching grass grow. Stay away from this one."
4,Tailgate cable for Chevrolet S10 Pickup,"This item has a very good price. Unfortunately, I noticed too late, that the picture does NOT show the attachment pins. The OEM pins are destroyed to remove the old cables, so you have nothing to attach the new ones with. The attachment pins are obviously not available anywhere separately. Spend a bit more and find a cable WITH the attachment pin."
4,An excellent read for anyone moving across cultures!,"Island Soul: A Memoir of Norway, by Patti Jones Morgan, is the delightful and poignant story of one woman's expatriate love affair with her host country. Relocating from Houston, Texas to Norway, the book evokes the phases of the transition experience and describes both the challenges of culture shock and the joys of cultural learning. Filled with insights for anyone relocating internationally, the book speaks especially to the importance of language study, to the role of animals and children as cultural bridges, and, most importantly, to the possibility of new relationships when hearts remain open. I recommend this book highly."
5,Great Book,This book is for anyone curious about life in Norway for an outsider.. That can be anyone besides a Norwegian!!!! It brought back many memories of my expat life for over four years in this beautiful country.... A must read if you are planning to move to Norway. It would have helped me a lot had it been in print before 1991... Patti does a wonderful job of letting the readers see with their minds the beauty of Norway and it's people....
4,A Stranger to Norway,"Island Soul captures the outsider experience with sensitivity and warmth. After moving to a Norwegian island community, Patti Jones Morgan tries to connect with her new neighbors but their natural reserve and her inability to use their language are barriers. Morgan struggles to learn Norwegian, taking the reader along as she gets to know students in the classes and gradually builds friendships with Norwegian children and adults. She conveys the isolation of a newcomer, an outsider, but also shares the scenes on her morning walks, the people she meets, and her eventual assimilation. It's a delight to read."
1,Don't waste your time.,"The author is a politically correct atheist who feels compelled, on nearly every page, to tell you how advanced the Chinese and Islamic civilizations were in the Middle Ages despite the fact that mechanical clocks were invented in Europe. Her anti-Christian and anti-Western asides got so disgusting I had to toss the book in the garbage."
3,This Here's A Fun Book!,"Author Swierczynski has crafted an entertaining, light-hearted, and trivia-filled glimpse into the great American pasttime of bank robbery, complete with how-to (and how-not-to!) tips from the pros. It's packed with historical chapters on all the noted practitioners of the trade and, while there are a number of historical errors crammed from unreliable sources like Nash's Bloodletters and Badmen, it's still packed with good information presented in a devilishly tongue-in-cheek format."
1,Incorrect information,The year of the Infamous shoot-out between Fred Barker and the FBI in listed incorrectly in this book. The shootout was not in 1939. How can this be published with such a huge mistake???
3,Devil May Care Attempt,"This book was purchased and read by me several years ago and at the time I wasn't too impressed with it. However, now that I have read it again, I found it to be somewhat appealing. It's a light-hearted book with fun filled chapters on bank robbers of the past and even how-to and not-to tips. However there are a lot of errors in the book, which tends to distract some readers, but others will like it's format and the authors style. For this, I have given it a ""three star"" rating. Read it at your own risk, for entertainment or historical value!Mike Koch, Author of ""The Kimes Gang."""
5,VERY REALISTIC INTERPRETATION,"This book is a must read,to anybodyinterested in the Sadat era.It comes from a famous journalist,who is close to power in many countries,and with sources of information that are full of intrigue.A very realistic book,loaded with facts,and analysis...it gives youthe answer to what happened on theday of october 6th 1981,why did ittake place,and why the end had to belike this.i highly recommend this book,thankyou Mr. haykal"
3,Beautiful package - terrible sound.,"The beautiful styling of the new Sony discman really caught my attention and I love the remote with the digital display. Battery life is great and the shock protection is faultless.All of these things do add up, but if it doesn't sound great, then what is the point! I bought this unit to replace my ten year old Sony car discman, but when I listened to them side by side with a nice pair of headphones (I used Grado SR60's), my old unit blows this right out of the water! The new Sony sounds muddy with any of the bass features on; tinny with it off. The highs are almost non-existant and there is no warmth to the sound.If your primary requirement for a portable CD player is sound quality, then this is NOT the one to pick! Now I'm kicking myself for not comparing before I purchased.(P.S. Anyone interested in taking mine off my hands?)"
3,Where's my LCD!,"It's definitely the smallest and the sleekest CD player outthere. Though I have some problems with it. There is no LCD display on the actual CD player (only on the remote control) which makes it pain to see what track you're on if you use it for your car or separate speakers. And the interface on the side of the CD are miniscule, whereas a top interface would have be more user friendly. The remote is also clunky; I would expect more from the designers at Sony. I'm guessing that Sony put all the controls and display on the remote to make the player smaller, but if you lose the remote, you're screwed.I regret not getting the Sony DEJ815 CD Walkman. It has a longer playing time (72 min), it [costs less], has the same exact remote control, and has the display and interface the on top of the player. The ONLY difference is that it's slightly bigger, and when I say slightly, I mean barely noticable. So for [less money], you get a much better player, in my opinion."
2,Avery 4021,"We are currently using the Avery 4021 Avery 4021 Dot matrix printer white addressing labels, 3 x 15/16, 4 across, 20000/box, but are experiencing a lot of paper jams on our IBM 6400 printer. The paper that the labels are mounted on appears to be extremely light and the feeding tractors rip it very easily, causing paper jams, wasted labels, and multiple reprints to get what we need. The tractor margin also seems a bit wider than the last box that we had. We have been using these same labels for several years and this box is really giving us problems.I have been trying to use less tension, but then the print quality seems to be less, too.We have had the printer checked by a qualified technician, but no easy solution to this problem has been found."
3,Not as visually adverised,Advertisement of product on site show item in box WITH the rubber spacers for setting the windshield. Arrived in a plastic bag with no setting blocks. Now I will have to make the spacers. Why can't they just say how it will actually come???? I guess that is what they pay their marketing employees for. It's always easier to ask for forgiveness or give excuses rather than ask for permission.
1,Still revolting after all these years....,I read the first book as a teenager. What a sickening and unrealistic plot. I could not understand why anyone would want to read this. It is boring and uneventful reading about cardboard characters with some stomach-churning incest thrown in.
4,REVIEW OF SHACKLETON DVD,"A very good film on Servant leadership, especially by the main actor as Shackleton. I remember he starred in Henry V and impressive when making speeches of inspiration.The only setback is the limit on the regions for playing the DVD on the computer notebook which allows you only one chance to play on the DVD drive. However, it can be played on certain DVD players if you get the right one. Perhaps, something can be done to permit the playing of the video for other regions."
3,"Educational, but not for Education","This DVD was well produced and tells the exciting story of Shackleton's fatefull Antarctic expedition very acurately. However, as a teacher, I must warn that without a lot of careful editing and fast-forwarding, this film is not immediately classroom appropriate. Definitely pre-watch for parts with language and one gruesome scene involving the amputation of a sailor's toes. I did show some appropriate scenes to my students and they really enjoyed seeing everything they'd read in Jennifer Armstrong's ""Shipwreck at the Bottom of the World"" acted out on screen."
2,I guess the book is always better!,"I got this as a gift for my husband. He had raved about the book and used the Shackleton story in conversation so much, I thought he would enjoy watching it. He said it was terribly disappointing."
2,"Disappointing, compared to the REAL story.","(My comments refer to the version aired on television.) I had read Caroline Alexander's book when I watched this. I was looking forward to it but found myself very disappointed -- Kenneth Branagh (ick), [bad] dialogue, the portrayal of Tom Crean as some kind of quaint Irish sidekick rather than as the indispensable and experienced leader he proved to be....Maybe it's just not possible to do a good ""dramatization"" of this story -- it's so dramatic and visceral on its own terms that anything else feels phony and watered-down."
1,What! No subtitles??,"Again, A&E has lost another sale. Product description of this DVD mentions ""closed captioned"" - which my system cannot manage, and says nothing about subtitles. Too bad; I'd love to own this true adventure story."
4,Shakleton...,"An okay movie loosely based on Ernest Shackleton's doomed voyage to the bottom of the world. The movie does its best to stick with his life from his diaries.This is a set of 3 dvds that give you a biography Shackleton, discovery channel of Anartica, and the movie itself."
4,the book is better,The movie doesn't have enough time to convey the extream hardship they faced. I read the book before i saw the movie and i thought the movie made their adventure seem tame. It is interesting if you don't have the time to read The Endurance. The story is so great that it needs more time but you get the general idea of the real life heroism that makes the story so unique.
4,I luv it,its the first album that I ever heard that sounds like people are falling down the stairs in the statue of liberty
3,cement lawn ornaments,I bought this book entirely because I was born and raised in murphysboro. It is a rarity that you see anything that acknowledges this town these days. Although there is no true mention of the town in this other then the title.
1,saxon algebra 2 home study packet test forms,"I'm having an incredibly hard time finding an answer key for this, if it even exists. If there is no answer key, this packet of test forms is pretty worthless for us, since we're not willing to spend hours each week figuring out the answer to correct the tests! Too bad!"
1,Don't Bother.,"There is no value at all in this movie. It's hard to believe this piece of junk is released onlyin 2008 - lousy cinematography, poor acting, simplistic plot, bad casting, and horrible lines - I've seen movies made in the 80s and 90s that have better production value than this."
3,Franklins first movie,A decent movie and good acting for Rich Franklins first film but could definately tell it had a low budget. I am glad I purchased this movie and hope the next one Rich acts in has a higher budget.
3,laughable,The only reason why this movie isn't getting 1 star is because it was funny commenting on all the obvious flaws in continuity and it was the best movie we rented that night...305/Restless....The main character is an extreme fighting star... get this movie if your an extreme fan of his...or if you want something to laugh at...eitherwise stay away from this movie.
1,Not what I expected!,"I had hoped that this was a serious look at Ki/Chi developement. It is not. It is a guy in street clothes teaching people in a parking lot to follow his ""moves""/ The music in the background is like that in a 3rd rate movie. Save your money ... do not buy this video. I wish I could get my money back!"
2,Not a brite idea,"Looked like a good product and it charged up OK. However the first time I used it in the dark the LED light left a lot to be desired. I need a light that shines a stronger beam. The person that was with me at the time asked, ""Is it on?"" Nuff said."
3,One good song and that's pretty much it,The only good song on Shades of Grace is Butterfly Kisses. What's the purpose in buying a 16 dollar CD and listening to only one song? The other ones are drowsy and make me want to fall asleep. Enough said. Just request Butterfly Kisses on your local radio station and you're listen to just as much Carlisle songs as you would buying the CD!
5,Very touching!!,"This song was part of my wedding back in '97! I absolutely loved it the first time I heard it. It brought tears to just about everyone at the reception! Since then, I have lost my father and this song has even more meaning today then it did 3 years ago. What a wonderful song!"
5,I GET LOST IN THIS CD!,"I am so impressed with this CD. You can ""feel"" the moment the singer is expressing. Sometimes I can invision the ""story"" and it reaches deep within. God is present here. Worth much more than words or money."
5,I think it's great!,I think the whole CD is great. My wife and I listen to it all the time and really enjoy it.
3,Good. The band Hump stands out above the rest of the groups,I don't like Lemon James voice. I wish bands would pick bettersong to cover. Jeax Couvade is way to weird. MY FAVORITE SONG IS 39DEAD.
3,Good book bad plans,"This is a good book to understand the making of Arch top guitars.BUT, I was very disappointed from the plans, actually there are no plans at allThere is a small scale plan of the top, poor informationAnd a few sketches of the braces....waste of paperIf you need a good arch top plan - this is not for you. Buy a plan separatelyThanksYaron."
5,All the information you need to make an archtop guitar,"I have now read this bock twice through since receiving it and feel confident that it provides the building blocks to start my (your) own journey into building archtop guitars. The chapters are concise focusing on the fundamentals of each element of the building process from wood selection to top and back shaping, side bending neck construction and finishing. I am about to embark on my first archtop guitar and after reading Robert's book I feel confident to do so."
4,Great book!,I had purchased this book for my son who is looking into the guitar making profession. He loves this book! Highly recommend it!
3,Nice to have but you need the paper version for a how to book,"Great book, was nice to read but if you want tobuild a guitar I imagine the pictures are notgoing to help you as they are hard to see.Probably want to get the paperback book next."
2,Not Sewn,Amazon could make it a little clearer that the binding on this notebook is *not* sewn but glued.
4,Great for college students,"I think the paper is high quality, and I particularly like that all of the pages come numbered. I don't know if you've ever had to number every single page in a composition notebook, but it isn't the most rewarding task. The only complaint I have is that overall the shell is a bit too compliant. I wish there had been a stiffer material used for the front and back covers."
5,I love this notebook,I like those notebooks for my lab work.They are big and a letter size paper can fit into itIt is also numbered which is good for indexingI recommend buying this nice notebook
4,Log book,This is a very handy notebook for retaining technical notes. We have used these at work for decades. They allow engineers and technicians a good way to pass down knowledge to later generations of technical workers. The grid is easy to use for writing and for drawings.
2,Out of date...,"Theologically, this book was out of date for me, focusing too much on just ""Christian worship"" without considering the growing awareness of cultural influences from other religious sources. It was also too evangelical for me, preferring a much more unitarian approach. It will work for some, but if people begin asking deeper questions about our historical resources, it will come up short."
4,Great project,"We used this as a preschool construction project. The kids had fun building their own birdhouses. They needed help with reading the directions and holding the pieces together, but an older child would be able to do the project easily."
4,Warning! No paint included.,"The box for this cute project shows a PAINTED, finished birdhouse on the front and says ""everything you need is included"" to make it, but they don't include any paint, so that statement is a little misleading. If I had known I'd have to go to a hobby shop to buy paint to finish it, I probaby would have just bought a kit from the shop."
5,Delicious!,"""Night Silence Desert"" is a treasure - pure heaven to listen to. The exquisite spiritual beauty and true loving instrumental/vocal mastery of this work is a collector's item - one of the best in Persian music. For me, it reflects the timeless grace and delight of Persian art and culture. I can easily listen to this CD again and again."
4,A fun addition to any Boggle-lover's collection!,"This is a great addition to any Boggle-lover's collection! Its small size is convenient to carry most anywhere. There are two basic games, timed and untimed. In the timed variation (3 minutes), two players can challenge each other. This is probably the device's strongest point. When playing against the computer, you can easily lose by 100 points or more! Unfortunately, the computer only gives you a partial list of words which it thinks you missed. But it's good practice anyway. In the untimed variation, you can only play with one player. The manual indicates that you can play an untimed variation with a 2nd player, but this is not true. The only other concern is that the screen is sometimes difficult to read - the lighting has to be just right. The screen is also not back-lit. Despite the few complaints , I still think this is a really fun gadget for Boggle lovers who would like to practice on the go!"
2,Don't recommend buying from Rave,"I purchased this item from Amazon (from Summit Sports) with free super saver shipping. It arrived, we filled it up. It didnt hold air. Summit sports said that I needed to handle the defect with the manufacturer, who in turn said I needed to ship this back to Minnesota ($25!) on my own dime. It took multiple emails/calls to Rave with my request to simply be a completely new tube. They ended up repairing it, which in my opinion, was the wrong thing to do, and they shipped it back for free. So my $100 end of the season deal on a tube became a $125 semi-new repaired tube. It still has yet to see the water as its now November!"
2,Good Sound Quality - Hard to use - Freezes a lot,"I have this player for 5 months now & am looking already to replace it.Pros:I really liked the sound quality, FM transmitter and the battery life.Cons:1)When a expansion SD card is used the MP3 player freezes upon start-up one out of five times. It then needs to be reset with a pin (it usually happens on the train when there's no pin to be found.2)You can't navigate the music files from the Expansion slot to the Actual players memory. You have to manually set the player If you want to select from the SD card or the players memory.3)Poor instructions in manual (pdf) included.4)Hard to navigate the button & options.I never use the FM radio & Voice Recorder,"
3,OK mp3 player for the price,I've had this product for about a year and a half now without any major problems. Some of the other reviewers should check to see if their firmware is updated to vs 1.7 as this fixed several issues with the unit. I have to say that for the price this player performs well. I use it with some Phillips sound reducing headphones and I think it sound pretty good. The fm transmitter is a little weak and the ear buds work as a better antenna than the one that comes with it. Also the menus are not very intuitive but after a while you can navigate them fairly quickly. I'd have to say that for the $60 that I spent I'm pretty happy. It's no ipod but then again it doesn't cost $300 either.
5,Standards Come Alive !,"What can I say about this guy's playing! An awesome talent with good help, makes this disc one that you can just keep spinning. Every time you will catch something new, a pause, a trill, a fill, a thrill. I got the cd for my 15 year old son who is an aspiring jazz pianist, but we will have to share this one!"
5,Best cordless phone with answering machine I've ever had,"We have tried many different cordless phones with answering machines and this is the best one we have had yet. It has a sleek design and great features. We wanteda unit that included call waiting/caller id, one that displayed new messages in some fashion (this unit has a blinking light with how many new messages you have since the last retrival), and had volume control for the handset as well as incoming and outgoing messages. Initially we didn't think we needed the extra hand set, but are using it by a computer and it is great. Interferance problems with the TV and microwave in the kitchen (where we have the main unit) have been minimal, which was a big problem with othercordless phone/answering machines we have had in the past. For the price, this is a great phone/acnswering machine combination!"
5,A Feast of Information,"Across from Emory University, in Atlanta, there used to be a store called Horton's. Over the entry were the words: IF WE DON'T HAVE IT, YOU DON'T NEED IT! The same could be said of ""Testing the Waters."" Ms Culbreath and Ms Neal have compiled a veritable feast of information for the career seeking teen. ""Testing the Waters"" is used frequently by the young people who frequent my study. It is extensive, accurate, and a veritable atlas of the roads to a successful career. The authors have done a wonderful thing in providing this tool. I cannot recommend it enough."
5,Great documentary of an intriguing Queen,"I really am a fan of David Starkey, who is one of premiere historians on the Tudor era, so it's no surprise I love this documentary. It is in two parts, with David Starkey narrating it. This documentary is not boring and it uses actors/actresses to act out various points. Of course this should not be taken as a be all end all discussion on Queen Elizabeth but it offers great insight and historical knowledge of the great Queen. If you like Tudor history, or just are interested about learning more about Queen Elizabeth, then I highly suggest you check this out. It is also has great replayability. I have watched it a dozen times."
5,I learned more than I thought...,"I tend to stick to French and German history, but a couple of years ago I began reading about Anne Boleyn and the fate of the other five wives. Now I'm learning about the children of Henry and Elizabeth: The Acclaimed Saga of England's Virgin Queen is a fantastic watch. The amount of information isn't overwhelming or underwhelming. I like that this isn't full of nonsense and wild untrue stories...I know some would consider it a bit boring, but I loved it. I hope to find more like this on Mary too."
2,Terrible service from Coleman,"I had a problem with the chair after just using it twice. A rivet broke on the backrest and it slid down, puncturing the fabric, making the chair unusable. I have tried to contact Coleman via email on their website and have not recevied a response after 2 weeks. I called them on the phone and was on hold for over 15 minutes before giving up. Makes me wonder if all of their products are as shoddy as their customer service."
2,Chair,I like the chair at first. The cooler pocket was a big hit. Then the chair snapped at the point where the bottom pieces cross and it is worthless.
3,it is okay...,Good quality but really heavy and hard to carry. Almost worth buying a cheaper lighter chair just so i can carry it. Hard to get in the bag to carry like most chairs but for this one it is necessary to go in the bag if you are going to carry it. Wish i didn't buy two of them.
1,Don't buy this chair!,"Bought this chair on-line. The 2nd time I used it the frame holding the back of the chair bent inward. I weigh less than 200 lbs. so it's not like I was overweight for it. I've had $10 chairs that never had that happen. It would of been a great chair if that wouldn't of happened. I'm stuck with it and it would probably cost around $10 to send back, not worth it. These chairs are made in China so you can guess how sturdy they are. Coleman buys a lot from China leaving me to not want to contribute to there products."
2,Coleman Blue Chair,"It is a comfortable chair for the it's primary design. After reading the warranty, my taste for Lawyers has been reinvested. Basically any chance for Coleman too be Green is lost. The warranty basically uses pages to inform you it has NO warranty. You are on your own PERIOD. Yuck. The chair does have some back support, for being folding."
4,Comfortable and useful for field sketching,"The description ""oversized"" does fit this chair. I bought it for a field sketching course and it is comfortable. I use the cooler to hold my supplies and the cup holder for my water bottle--both very handy for that. There's also a side pouch for holding my sketch book or other frequently needed items. The cooler compartment could also keep my lunch if I needed. The only disadvantage to this chair is its large size on long hikes. It's not as light and easy to carry as the smaller version that some of my other classmates have. Slipping it back in its pouch can also be difficult to do, especially if you have to leave in a hurry."
2,Coleman Oversized Quad Chair,"From the photo this looked like the perfect chair to take to the beach or park. In fact, it is easy to set up andit folds fairly easy and fits snugly in the bag that comes with it. I ordered two of them for my wife and I.We have used it on two trips to the beach and we agreed they are just not very comfortable. You really can't lean back sitting in the chair and if you want to try and get comfortable you almost have to slouch in the chair. In addition, at 10 lbs each they are too heavy to lug around very far. These are not inexpensive chairs and I regret that I waited too long to send them back.I'm still looking for a simple light weight chair I can take to the beach."
3,Great camping chair,"This chair is very comfortable with its higher, wider and padded back. Having a portable fridge to keep the brews cold is cool, too. The only reason I only gave it three stars is because I received two defective chairs before getting one that appears to be in good shape. Once you get a good one though, it's great."
2,Sade Live Munich 1984,The video quality is very poor... the audio quality is acceptable... I have the impression that it is an unofficial product.
3,I almost never review,I got these yesterday and they are small and the blue in the picture is kind of a duller bluse. All in all concerning the price these are a cute little earning. If not for the duller color they would have been a 5.

1,Proto-Religion,"Take this book, professed dictation of alien intelligence by a mere hominid, let it stew in hyperhype for generations and voila... new religion! Let's see... can anyone name a major world faith (or, gee, nearly all of 'em) centered on one person's claim to an intimate relationship with some creator deity?Stop kidding yourself. Remember Santa Claus? Same thing."
1,Classic Pseudoscience,This is classic pseudoscience -- representing either the delusions of the author or (which happens in many such cases) a way for a clever author to rip off as many readers as possible. It is too bad that there is a market for this sort of fiction presented as if it were factual.
1,BEWARE people of the Zetas,"This group (the zeta greys) is responsible for the many unwanted and uncomfortable abductions that we hear so much about. They are in direct confrontation with the Guardian Alliance of the Elohim, Arcturians, Pleiadians, and other beneficent entities devoted to helping mankind usher in the New Age. It is true there will be much upheaval and chaos but the Zetas want to capitalize on your fear (and our governments) to ultimately use it to destroy us.If this material doesn't resonate (truly feel right) with you then try Barbara Marciniak's series of teachings from the Pleiadians and Patricia Pereira's Arcturian Star Chronicles. Then once you have a solid understanding of what's going on, move on to Operation Terra I & II and Ashayana Deane's Voyagers I & II. These last 4 books will open your eyes like nothing else about what is in store for the human race in the next few years.Namaste!"
4,Zetatalk,"I think the website is more updated and gives more reading than the book. There is nothing said of the Hollow Earth though and of the superior beings living inside it (other than the Men in Black.)Nothwithstanding the above, for readers who wish to obtain an insight into the alien presence and influence, this book gives much knowledge and information which is not available in many places.A revelation of facts which makes many of our theories fall apart or fall into place.Andrew Foong"
3,Lieder and Zetans with an Ulterior Motive,"Having traded email and other postings with Ms. Lieder herself, there is much to be said about considering the source. While I have a tendency to agree with some of what she says and even believe that there may be contact with these entities, I also believe that Ms. Lieder has designs publicly for other more self-motivated reasons. She does exhibit symptoms of schizophrenia and this is profoundly evident in some of the email traded with her from her discussion forum.I would be wary of anyone, including aliens, that say 'I come in peace'."
2,Drivers not available online,"For some unknown reason, even to the management in customer support, there are no drivers for XP available online. I got the ""in an ideal world every company would have every driver available but we don't live in an ideal world."" He also told me that Creative makes a lot of products and I suppose that means they can't afford the bandwidth or the time to make it available. I've been a customer of Creative Labs for years and years, and honestly, this is the first time I've been disappointed. I hope they correct this problem."
2,"Great concept, poor execution.","For the price, I was happy with the quality of construction.No where in the product specifications does Creative claim that it'll work with Windows Vista or MacOS X, and it certainly doesn't work with either; but it's almost 2009! They need to get their act together and write drivers for modern operating systems. (Most PC manufacturers aren't even shipping computers with XP anymore!)If you've got XP, it's a fun device, and it works well with the software provided by Creative. It's been a little flaky for me when I try to use it as a MIDI device in more advanced, third-party software (likeReason), but that's usually cured with a reboot.If Creative wrote MacOS X drivers, this thing would be fantastic with GarageBand... but alas, they do not (and as far as I can tell, based on the forums on their website, they do not intend to)."
1,No VISTA support,"Gosh this would be a really cool product -- except that it doesn't work with the Vista operating system and, guess what, Microsoft considers XP to be ""end of life""! Come on, Creative, if you are not going to support your current products under the current Windows operating system -- well, that's pretty bad."
2,Tiny print,"I find this book almost impossible to read without a magnifying glass. I guess they saved on paper, but at the cost of my eye sight. The content seems to be useful, but how can I know when I can't see it?"
2,"flying insects, not!",I bought this item to deter flies because it says it will work with flying insects. Flies will actually land and sit on it without any apparent problems. I gave it to charity.
1,Doesn't Work,I don't have mice so I can't rate it on that. I does nothing for insects. Also I had to give it one star because it was required.
4,ultrasonic pest repeller,I don't like the item because it consist of 2 pieces: a power cord and a repellent unit. It would be great if it would be one compact item.
1,seems to work,"we started seeing small black spiders in our house so we wanted to try one of these to see if it would get rid of them.a few hours after we plugged it in and set it on the insect setting, i started seeing spiders periodically running across the floor so its obvisously doing something to them (hope its running them outta the house).i have heard that some spiders can adapt to the sound after awhile so its still up in the air wether it works in the long run aand wether or not its driving them out or the sound is just agitating them but so far its certainly doing something and having an affect on them.***UPDATE***After a year the device quit So have dropped my rating down to 1 star.Seemed to only annoy the spiders when it was working rather than keep them away."
3,It only work for ants!,"I'm very afraid of spiders and expected it would work for them, but it seems only work one month for SOME spiders, not all of them. And after one month those spiders all coming back...but it did work for ants! But the way, it is noisy all the time, have to get used of its small annoying noise."
2,not happy does not work,i bought this product for my garage to help with spiders and other bugs.i have not noticed any change what so ever. matter of fact there was a spider walking across the front of it while it was turned on. what a waste of money. don't waste your time it does not work!!
4,works great but noisy,"i purchased the ""Black & Decker EX900-A-TP1 Ultrasonic Pest Repeller (XL Room)"" because we had some roof damage from a storm a while back and a pair of squerrels moved in to the ceiling. 24 hours after pluging this unit in they where gone.the only drawback is the unit emits a constant ""chirping"" sound. it can be quight annoying. but efective none the less. the chirping is less noticeable on the ""insect"" setting tho im not sure this setting would work for ""rodents"". all in all quight pleased."
1,Did NOT work :-(,"My friend had a bad mouse problem in a high-rise condo. I gave her my unit, and over the last 12 months, the problem only got worse, despite glue traps and other efforts."
2,Makes annoying chirping noise,"The repeller works fine at repelling, but when on the ""rodent"" setting it makes an audible chirping noise that's annoying so it can be used only in remote locations where people don't normally go.The reason we bought this model was because it can run on batteries and we wanted it for an outer shed, but the manual says that it'll only run two or three days on battery power, making it absolutely worthless for this use."
1,Don't Waste Your Money!!!,"I bought this thing and put it in my garage for about a month. One night I saw a mouse running across my stove so I brought it in and put it directly on the stovetop. Later that evening I was washing dishes, and the mouse ran back and forth from behind my microwave with his little cheeks full of Shake'n'Bake RIGHT PAST THE RODENT REPELLANT FIVE TIMES!!!"
2,B&D Pest Repeller,"I just purchased this B&D; pest repeller for an off-grid cabin. I bought this specific model because it also takes a 9-volt battery. About the sound it emits - there is noise coming from the unit, but you really have to be paying attention to hear it. I wouldn't recommend buying it for a bedroom or living area. Get it planning to place it in your basement, garage, seasonal cabin (with electricity), etc.---UPDATE---DON'T MAKE THE MISTAKE I MADE - ACCORDING TO THE MANUAL, THE BATTERY LIFE IS ONLY 2-4 DAYS, OPERATING CONTINUOUSLY FOR 24 HOURS A DAY.That little tidbit of information should be in the product description. Guess I will be plugging it into the garage and setting up Adirondack traps in the cabin. Joy!"
2,Didn't work for me,"When I first got this home, it seemed to do the trick ok. The mice really avoided it, however we could still hear them across the room. I was going to order a couple more to place around the room, but they walk right past it now! It doesn't seem to affect them at all! For $20 it's not a bad deal because obviously it works for some people, it just didn't work for us:("
1,Not worth it.,I purchased this product as I was familiar with the Black & Decker brand name. The reason for this purchase is because I had seen/killed several maybe two or three roaches in my kitchen over the last week. After cleaning everything & not finding anymore I plugged the repeller to repel any future pests. About two days later I saw another roach not far from the ultrasonic pest repeller; in fact it was right on TOP of the repeller as if it was doing an inspection! I quickly got rid of the pest & took the product outside to the back & plugged it in near spiders & other outside bugs. They were not fazed by the thing at all. You will be better off just calling someone to take care of the problem for you.
2,Great concept but disappointing,"I recently bought this toy for my 2 1/2 year old son. While it's a great concept, the finished product is definitely disappointing. The main problem is that the drill becomes idle too quickly. There is a reset button on the back of the drill but it's too small for a young child to push. So before he can finish drilling a peg into the hole the drill stops and he's forced to wait for it to reset itself. Unfortunately, by that time, he's become very frustrated with the toy.Despite this, he does seem to like the toy and enjoys playing with it. However, every time he plays with it, I am forced to reset the drill every few seconds for him. Independent play time is definitely out with this toy!"
2,This toy is SUPER annoying...,"My son picked this toy out on a trip with his aunt. She bought it for him for Christmas last year. He tried so hard to get the drill to work properly. He would get mad and cry because it wouldn't screw the screws in. My son has a workshop with tools that he can really use, so this one was confusing to him. This is not for a child that can already use a toy screwdriver. It will only frustrate the child and you."
2,Disappointing Christmas toy,"Quite a lame game! The toy stops constantly-I know this is part of the game, but my kids ages 3, 5 and 7, lost interest very quickly. Frustrating for them, and a waste of my money!"
2,Don't bother,"My son who is 3 1/2 saw this on tv and had to have it. He is a total tool guy and loves to be by my side with his tools and fix things. This toy is REALLY [bad]. Our screwdriver gets stuck on the same phrase for a very long time and the only way to stop it is to turn the drill off and turn it back on. He definately did not get why the drill turns off while he is trying to drill. It might be ok as a toy (if it worked), but the concept of the game totally does not work. If I were you I would not bother spending money on this one. Buy him some toy tools that he can just play with instead. I thought this was going to be one of his favorites and we have to return it to the store."
5,"A smart, engaging and elegant read - and great fun, too.","Lev Raphael does academia better than anyone. This book takes a clever and delightful series up a notch. The story grabs the reader's attention immediately, then twists and turns as clues and characters are introduced in a very engaging manner. Throughout the solution of the crime, we are entertained by Raphael's sharp wit and humor (look for Minnie, and the Michigan ""trend"" of older women in relationships...), his skillful use of literary references, and the wonderful growth in the relationship between Nick and Stefan. Mystery fans will love all the allusions to writers and trends within the genre. This is an absolutely delicious read!"
5,Dazzling Satire/Delicious Mystery,"Lev Raphael is writing the best academic satire around, in the rich tradition of England's David Lodge. I've been a professor at a Michigan university for 30 years and have never seen anyone capture the absurdities of academic life so well. Not only that,the mystery is intelligent, the writing is sure-footed and witty,and every character is engaging. There's an almost Dickensian feel to this book that makes me determined to follow Raphael's series,and I don't usually enjoy mystery series that much, but prefer stand-alones. No wonder he's admired by the New York Times and the Washington Post! Don't miss the erudite, literate entertainment of this book."
1,School daze,"This self-billed academic mystery has reviewers divided into two schools of thought: loved it or hated it. I'm forced to enroll in the school of hard knocks (against the head) instead of the school of soft pats (on the back). The book squanders too many pages presenting campus as canvas, then fails to paint anything of worth. The stabs at wit were blunt and distracting, despite the supposed satiric nature of the story. I don't mind that the author is an elitist bent on displaying how much more clever he is than the reader. I just wish he'd do it through a mystery that delightfully stumps us. He came about as close as the next galaxy."
2,the Donnas lite,"I listened to it a few times, and nothing really stuck out, other than Who Do You Dance For, but it just sounded like watered down Donnas to me. Kinda like the Donnas new album, which is pretty watered down too! I haven't heard Sahara's earlier albums so I can't judge wheather or not this is watered down Sahara Hotnights, but I did hear great things about them in the past. Disaapointing. Best thing about it? I borrowed it from the library and didn't actually pay for it."
4,Ditch Heidi cut'n'paste,Heidi Kakes - the review you wrote for Kiss&Tell is *exactly* the same as you wrote for the Strokes' new album (Room on Fire). Quit wasting our time with cut'n'paste.
4,Hotness!,"I first listened to this CD in my store, and while I wasn't real excited by it, I plopped my name down to get it free.Flash forward two months.I get home with my horde of CDs and pop them all into my CD player, taking a few moments to listen to each and every one of them. Sahara Hotnights caught my attention.Now I listen to it everyday.The first single to catch my ear was Empty Heart. The ""Oh's"" at the beginning of the song remind me muchly of Jimmy Eat World's wonderful ability to make hooks without words, and thus started my descent into the CD.Soundwise I would compare Sahara Hotnights to Sleater-Kinney and Peaches. While that combination is a bit strange, it makes sense when you listen to the songs. Throw in Jimmy Eat World's music and pop sensibility.Give it a listen, it's so much fun."
4,Crisper vocals allow band to finally shine...,"My main complaint about this band's previous work was that the lead singer's vocals were often unintelligble or overly distorted by a kind of Siousxie and the Banshees echo effect.This CD is the first where the vocals are presented crisp and filter free, and the result is fabulous. There is less of a 'bat out of hell' quality that Jennie Bomb had, the tempo is a little slower and the songs are a little bit more structured -- surely there are going to be garage purists who say that they 'sold out' -- but the quality is so good, I think we can just write those people off as annoying hipsters.Those of us not trying to prove how cool and underground we are are going to have a hard time not liking the incredibly infectious collection of upbeat rock songs on this CD. It is sure to appeal to many, and hopefully, this talented group of Swedes is finally going to get the recognition they deserve."
4,almost great,Excelent production values but the sound remains rocking hot. It may not be as raw as their previous two records buut it is great. Thez have a slightlz more poppz sound which is whz it did probablz not come over as well and did not do as well as the previous release did.
1,automotive book with a political agenda,"I read the introduction and the first chapter before I had to stop. The book is written in a very opinionated editorial style and the author's anti-american sentiment was very perceptible. All the facts, he says, were taken from old automotive magazines and news articles but he failed to list each specific reference in a footnote on what he was stating as fact. A careful reader will see opinion is laced within the facts. The six truisms he lists about why we think, as car guys, the cars from the musclecar era are the best, is interesting. I've often thought how the ""good ole days"" never really existed, but his tone is that cars made in that era up untill today's SUV age are ridiculous, unneccesary, and wasteful. Robert Harless is more of a critic than he is a enthusiast of American musclecars. His ideals are something we'd expect from the French."
2,Sucked - do not buy this book,"Rating the author is senseless because the book (especially car books) never have enough pictures and detailed descriptions of the unique features of the selected car... however this book is a waste of a read. The author is way off base, his conclusions are nonsensical and he is ranting about something nobody cares about. I ordered it by accident, gave it to a friend as a present and he returned it... just my 2 cents"
3,"Good quality, nice scent.","These are good quality candles in heavy frosted glass votive holders, but they're nothing spectacular. The scents are wonderful - my favorite is the Sonoma Valley - but are not strong. After burning one for hours in my bedroom, the entire room was only faintly scented. If you enjoy burning scented candles for the scent as much as the ambience, you may want to skip the votives and go for the poured candles (stronger scent, but larger and more expensive). If you just want nice candlelight and a pleasant scent, I am sure you will enjoy these. The votives are nice for re-use, too."
5,candles,"I like that there are a few differnt colors. If there is only one or two colors I get bored with them, but if there are like four I'll like them."
4,Summer fun,Bought these for a trip to Florida 1st day walked 3 miles an are so comfortable. They clean up very nicely and I would suggest these for anyone who walks a lot in resort parks. This is my 3rd pair and I won't buy anything else.
5,Most Comfortable Flip Flops,"Reef Women's Girls Slap 2 Flip Flops are the most comfortable flip flops ever! They are stylish, provide outstanding comfort and you can wear them all day and your feet feel fabulous! There's no pinching, blisters or discomfort. I would recommend these to anyone who loves to wear flip flops and wants comfort for their feet. Worth every penny!"
5,awesome,"i got these,, i needed something with good support as i am recovering from foot surgery.. they are soo comfy. took to the beach and they clean off so easily.. like new, there is good traction on bottom of them so you wont slip either.,,, Reef makes awesome flip flops i have gotten them for my son,,this was my 1st pair. PS they do run a little small.. so may get next size up :) great shoes"
2,Comfortable for a while,Very comfortable and well made flip flop. These flip flops are great if you need cushion and support. Not sure why but I had to return first pair and order 1 size larger than the exact shoe purchased in the store. After wearing them for a few months I have discovered that they are not as well made as the same brand purchased at a surf shop. The rubber hardened pretty quickly and the straps became loose fitting. They say they are REEF but they may be a knockoff.
2,Fit odd,"I've previously had the Fannings and loved them. I thought since it was the same company that makes these they'd be very similar. I was very disappointed to learn that was not the case. These state they're medium and I've never had an issue with a 7M before, however, when I try to slide my foot in the back strap near the heel is too narrow and cuts into my arch. It's extremely uncomfortable and I had to return them due to the discomfort.I should have just stuck with what I'm used to. I knew the Fannings were comfortable and I these looked so similar I thought I'd give them a try. Even from looking at the photo of these the straps don't look like they're squeezing the foot but either I received an item that was put together wrong or the shoe is the photo is just better.I hate complaining and returning but I really had no choice on these. Looks like everyone else has had success."
5,Reef thong sandals are the simply the best...,"My last pair of Slap 2 thong sandals from Reef are exactly what I expected: attractive and well-made with excellent arch support and ideal bottom walking surface. I've been wearing Reef sandals for years. I love the Sandy, but find that the Slap 2 has a bit better arch support and looks a little less casual. I started with the men's Slap 2 in size 5, but moved to women's size 6 and find them perfect. I normally wear a size 7 medium shoe, so the Slap 2 runs slightly wide. The Reef sandal is a staple in my closet. I always have at least four pair (in good shape). They are my garden, casual, and run-to-the store shoe nearly year round."
5,Great!,"Henry and Mudge and the Wild Goose Chase (Henry & Mudge Books (Simon & Schuster Paperback))We have about 9 of these books. Each is a unique story, there is no formula here. They are creative stories that deal with real life situations in a special Henry and Mudge fashion. They are warm and loving and fun. Henry loves his big dog Mudge. In this story the family takes a trip to the country to buy some farm fresh eggs. An aggressive goose frightens Henry and Mudge, but Mudge has the last ""word""."
2,You'd better see it first...,"Umm...yikes. Wish I would have flipped through this one before I threw my money down. It's hard to fault Ms. Charton for her enthusiasm and inventiveness, but this book isn't for everyone. I found many of the designs to be gimmicky and over the top. All in all there's nothing in it for me. Maybe for the do-it-yourselfer? Design professionals looking for elegant treatments, look elsewhere."
5,"excellent resource...a ""must have""","If you have a child with ADHD, an Autism spectrum disorder/Pervasive Development Disorder, or sensory integrative issues then this book will be an excellent read!! I love that it has entire chapters/sections devoted to the interaction between a specific disorder/diagnosis/cluster, and sensory response/reactions...the book is well-written, is readily understandable to lay-persons, yet it is as useful to therapists as many other books on the market...my son's therapist copied almost the entire book when she borrowed it from me!!!In a nutshell, this book gives you certain behaviors that may manifest, gives ideas on how to resolve...yet is never preachy...love this book"
2,Poorly Organized,"This book rambled, stumbled over itself, and was filled with grammatical errors. It was hard to determine where the authors were trying to go, and it seemed that once they got there, they offered little, if any, information that was actually useful. I learned perhaps two new things from this book, and they really aren't things that will help me to help my Aspergian son."
3,A Good Book for a General Introduction - Serious Fans May Be Disappointed,"Overall this is a decent little guidebook into the world of the new Battlestar Galactica series. Most people will find a lot of good general information.However, for serious fans, there is very little we don't already know contained in this book. Also, apparently this guide was thrown together quite hastily, and by people not that closely associated with production, because it contains many pieces of information which are in direct contradiction to statements/info/events in the show and on RDM's weekly podcasts.Overall, meh, it could use some work. Thankfully the quality of the guide does not reflect the quality of the show."
1,Nearly a vanity project,"I am a recent BSG devotee. Because I have watched the seasons out of order, I read all three season companions this past weekend, hoping to find some answers.However, these companions are full of accolades for every director/actor/writer. Everyone is brilliant!! Can you believe that?They do describe alternative writing scenarios - this episode was split into two, etc. This might be interesting if you were considering a career in television writing."
4,A fun read on a Sunday afternoon,I was vacationing in Washington DC for a few days and came across this book. I'm usually a bit skeptical about these type of books but this one had some good behind the scenes info and was an enjoyable few hours of reading.Vermonter dot com approved!
5,The sweetest songs...,"This tape was given to me by a good friend when my 3 month old little girl would not fall asleep in her own crib. I played it the first night she gave it to me and she has slept in her own crib ever since. Not only is it relaxing for baby but for mom and dad as well, we listen to it on the monitor as she falls asleep. There isn't a night though, that we can't get past the song Butterfly kisses without tears in our eyes thinking of the future with her. My other favorite song is ""You made me real"" about a toy that lives because of the love the little child gives it. It is so sweet and makes you think back to when you were a child with your favorite stuffed animal/best friend. It's such a sweet album I will give it to everyone I know that has a baby in the future!"
4,Not what I expected,"This is overall a great cd, but for one thing... I bought it mainly for the Butterfly Kisses song, but to my great disappointmnent the version on this cd is not the really deep and powerful one we always hear on the radio. It's much lighter and kind of wimmpy, I thought. Defintely not as good as the version I was expecting."
5,Fantastic! Perfect for parents and children!,"This is a wonderful CD! They have just released a second CD. Butterfly Kisses and Bedtime Prayers II. I already placed my order. ""Before I Knew Your Name"" is a perfect new parent song, as well as an excellent wedding song for parents to dedicate to their children. My sister is having it played during her ceremony, when the mothers light the unity candle. It will be a forever favorite!!!!!!"
5,The Most Beautiful Lullabies I've Ever Heard!,"I bought this 10 years ago to play for my grandson and other grand children while getting them to sleep. It was perfect! They slept everytime. When my grand daughter was in Children's Medical Center Hospital in Dallas, I mailed it to her Mom to play for her. Well, it didn't get there, so I found another one here at Amazon.com....several days later I got the one I had mailed back! So I've got 2..I gave the new one to my grand daughter and I have mine back. It has the sweetest songs on it by some of the greatest artists. I haven't found one yet to compare to it. You will love it..I promise!"
2,A hillbilly with a doily for a mask is not scary....,"Or even psychologically daunting, the fifty cent flour sacks from the strangers were better at scaring me than grannies lace doily.The acting in the film was not to blame for the dismal failure of this film, the blame for that lies with the costuming, the director and most of all the screenwriter.The film is not the worst out their but given the choice again of watching this film or sponge bathing seniors at the old people's home, I will head on over to the home without a doubt."
2,A little weak on real advice,"As a college admissions professional, the author spends too much time on her former ""upper east side"" [...] clients instead of giving advice on how to get parents' ""real world"" students into the best college or university they should apply to and get accepted at."
5,Most Informative and Helpful,This book was Very helpful. All the information I needed and a lot of help on items I would have never thought of myself.
4,"KD, KD, Give me your answer, do!","This is Canadian author K.D. Miller's first collection of short stories. It was apparent when I read this collection in 1994 that she would become a force in the Canadian literary world, and so she has done, with her second collection, _Give Me Your Answer_, and her latest non-fiction work, _Holy Writ_. The skill and delicacy with with she lays out a story is unsurpassed. While some of these stories are dark, reading will provide rewards. A writer to watch, closely."
2,Thumbs down,"SAILING BRIGHT ETERNITY by Gregory Benford is the conclusion of a series that failed to live up to its jacket blurb. Reading 50 or so pages in, I stopped because of boredom. Initially, I thought the series might be like Robert Heinlein Lazarus Long books, which I enjoyed back in the '60's and '70's. No way. The jacket praises the ""hard science,"" which I saw as totally speculative far futurism. The use of a chimera of hard science detracted so much from the action of what I read, I couldn't go on. The conversations were minimal and hard to follow. My suggestion is that if you haven't read Heinlein's STRANGER IN A STRANGELAND, read it first. Then go to the first of Benford's series. To be somewhat fair, it is possible that had I done that, I would have been drawn in and at least read the whole first novel of the series."
3,A mess,"Whilst there's a nugget of a satisfying conclusion to the rest of the series here, the editor should be fired for not expunging at least 1/3 to 1/2 of what ended up between the covers of this book. Besides the needlessly shoehorned speculative science and the dread dreary zombies and riverboat and a couple of other sections, the high-concept stuff gets seriously weakened by over-prodding. If you're going to have aliens which are beyond our comprehension, be aware that if you write their dialog, it will be coming from a human mind.And how many times do we have to be told about how matter deforms spacetime so spacetime can be deformed to simulate matter in the form of the esty? It seemed like it was twice a chapter at one point (And the chapters are short)"
4,a deep review on japan keitai/mobile phone culture,"This is THE source for understanding japan keitai/mobile culture from early 90s to current. And authors investigate different aspect of keitai in japan life which do help me understand how it is, and why it is.With current issues, Nokia pulls out of japan recently, and iPhone's user are very unhappy about iPhone ( less than 7% iPhone users really like it). All the questions can be answered by this book partially.But this is not a great book by lacking the compare and holistic view as normal anthrography research dose.Anyway, it's worth reading."
2,"Not very good, but the only thing out there","This book, like most of the other nutshells I've read, is not particularly helpful. The organization is confusing, and not enough attention is devoted to major topics, as the format is primarily just a recitation of cases. A study guide is supposed to provide a concise synopsis of the law, not merely throw a bunch of conflicting cases at the reader. Steven Emanuel has the market for law school study aides cornered, with the Examples & Explanations series a distant second. Unfortunately, this is the only major study guide that exists for employment law. Thanks to Rothstein's worthless and maddening casebook, learning employment law is neither interesting nor fun. This nutshell will provide some relief, but not much."
3,"Cute, but not easy!","This is a fun set with a lot of options, but it is fairly difficult to change the rings and bands."
1,Not Pleased....,"Very cute on the website and sounded like a good deal. But as they say if it sounds too good to be true it probably is. This set is very cheaply made and smalll. Not very cute in person either, the picture does it some good. I guess I learned my lesson on purchasing just off the picture."
1,Not pleased,"I too purchased this watch set as a ""gold box"" deal and was very disapointed with the quality. I bought this as a graduation gift for a friend's daughter and am now looking to just give her a check and will give this to my 10 year old daughter whom I think it would be more appropriate for. This is definately a childs watch set and should be marketed as such. FYI, the face on the watch I received appeared to be ""rumpled"" as the other reviewer remarked upon."
3,Not Croton's best quality,"The watch comes in an attractive case and makes an initial good impression but the quality isn't there. The watch links seem to be made of tin rather than a solid metal. The various colored bands and bezels appear ok and are also attractive, but I don't trust them to hold up to heavy wear. I've worn just the pink once thus far; haven't wanted to change it out yet.It has a one year warranty and maintains accurate time so far. I've had it 2 months."
5,It's about time someone set some new standards!,"I love John Pizzarelli's work, and this is one of my favorite of his albums. For one thing, there are a lot of wonderful songs on here that haven't been done to death by every other jazz artist living and dead. With the exception of the Rosemary Clooney hit, ""Come On-A My House,"" these were all new to me. And Pizzarelli performs them beautifully. He can convey playfulness or longing or soaring hope in a song. As much as I liked his Nat King Cole and Beatles covers, I hope that he will chart a new direction with more material like this."
2,not up to par,"First off, let me make it clear that I love John Pizzarelli and his style. I simply don't like this album. While five or six tracks are excellent, the others are just trite. Even with this I normally just listen to the first two tracks then turn it off."
5,Hanukah candles,"Beautiful, exactly what I wanted.. the box although packaged well, had a big hole in the center. I would still buy from this seller again. The product is Great!!!"
5,Enjoyable,"This book is a must read for anyone even minutely interested in World War II. It's an overview of all the events of World War II. I dropped all other books to finish this one; it is that good. It's dated, but don't let that scare you away. After reading this book you will close it with an understanding of World War II most books fail to deliver. It's easy to read and very enjoyable. The author throws in interesting history that makes the war personal.Don't waste money on some newer history book that's going to cost tenfold and won't be nearly as enjoyable."
5,Star Wars: Epic Duels,"This game is great for anybody, from casual players up to the deepest thinkers. On the surface, it's a fun game; but there is plenty to dig into. Every character has special cards related to the movie (i.e. Boba Fett's thermal detonater, or Yoda's force push.The best part of this game is the chance it gives you to create and recreate any one on one battle with your favorite characters from the Star Wars movies. Darth Vader can now fight himself, Anakin Skywalker!Buy it. It's worth your money!"
4,Epic fun,"You don't need to be a SW fan necessarily to enjoy this game. It has some similarities to chess, in that particular characters can only move and attack in particular ways, and that strategy and thinking/planning ahead are important.There are different ways to play: free-for-all/every-man-for-himself version and good vs. bad teams version. The game's rules are good at keeping to the spirit of the SW universe and its characters' powers, and you can even find ways to make your own modifications that might make the game more interesting for you. Depending on how well your character decks are shuffled and what characters are in play -- as well as players' level of aggression! -- the game can go very quickly or drag (the first game or two can be like that as players get acclimated)."
5,Epic Duels,"I think this game is a great idea for Star Wars fans who dream what it would be like if the Emperor fought Yoda or if Luke fought Count Dooku. It is a great value ... It keeps your interest for a good while and it doesn't let you down. The decks provide different strategies I see as the character's personality. My brother, my sister, and I all selected our personal favorites and keep them to ourselves. I suggest playing with each deck until you find one that fits your style."
4,very fun,"I got this game about two weeks ago and I love it. You should play it a couple of times to see who you are best at playing with and discover ways to win.I gave it all four stars because no game is perfect.... but this is pretty close. The more people you have playing the more fun it is. It is still fun with two people though. This is my favorite board game. It can be easy, it can be hard, it is at a different levels of difficulty every time you play it. This game is worth the money."
2,WARNING: this game needs help,hello i got this game 3 days ago and its not all its cracked up to be. the detail on the figures are poor and they are flimsey.it is also lacking important people. it also ends too quik(about 5 minutes with 2 players). i do not recomend this game it is a waste of you money.
5,Another must see for the serious horror fan!,Another excellent horror movie. A must see film. I just wish they would make horror movies like this currently. Excellent scare factor.
2,not scary enough,This had the makings of a real classic. It was a pity the way it turned out. There were times I actually laughed at this. I agree with the reviewer who wondered why bringing it all out in the open suddenly makes everything OK. It never explained why this was the case. It seemed to be edited very badly in places and made us laugh at what could have been truly scary. This didn't scare me at all. I kept waiting but it just didn't happen.
3,the legend of hell house,this movie was not what i expected. i found it BORING! nothing about it was especially good.
2,"Beware, Horror Fans","If you're looking for a really scary movie, don't buy this movie. It takes a great premise and goes nowhere with it. There are a few chills, but they're all dissipated by the poor direction, writing, and cast. Nothing makes sense, and when it does, it just seems stupid. Poor Roddy McDowell is stuck in a role no one could play believably, and that goes for the whole cast, all of whom appear to be sleep walking. Horror fans, don't be fooled. This is not a scary movie."
1,low camera angles and dry ice fog do not a movie make,"Wow, what a glorious disaster of a movie. I couldn't discern a motivation from any of the four characters. Stupid people doing stupid things and being either stuffy or melodramatic about it. Cringe-inducing performances linked by adequately artful cinematography and some easy-on-the-eye set design. But neither the paranormal nor the ""scientific"" explanations of what's going on have a leg to stand on. There are a few effective sequences, especially the bit with the ectoplasm, but, they're hamstrung by the simple fact that MONEY (let alone convictions about the paranormal) doesn't seem a believable enough motivation for supposedly intellgent characters to allow themselves to be repeatedly assaulted and maimed (and WORSE). I'm all for sustained mood in this type of film but for crying out loud- SOMEBODY tell a JOKE... make a funny remark... ANYTHING that might make the scares in between just THAT much more effective."
1,"Not scary--- no ghosts, nothing spooky","I bought this movie because it had so many high-star ratings. So, I was very surprised when I watched it and found there were no, meaning zero, ghosts, skeletons and scary scenes. The movie takes place in an old, dark house with cob webs all over. There are some strange sounds that are supposed to represent haunted spirits. The scariest scene is when a black cat chases the ""mental-medium"" character and scratches her.The 4 characters in the movie went to the haunted house with the task of finding out if people survive after death i.e. determine if the owner of the house who was supposed to be dead but no body was ever found is still living in the house ""in spirit"". In the end of the movie, 2 of them leave the house alive. The other 2 had died from things falling on them. Overall, the movie was disappointing."
4,A Classic Haunted House Story,"I've recently gotten interested in ""haunted house"" stories and decided, based on the reviews of others, to check out this title.Yep, it's a keeper for my slowly expanding collection of favorites. I know a flick belongs in this collection when I view the film more than once and, so far, I've viewed this on about 1/2 dozen times!The story involves a psychic research team of four that enters the worst haunted house on Earth to satisfy the curiousity of an aging, but generous, millionaire as to whether or not survival after death is possible. By the end of the movie, the two survivors who emerge from the horrors of hell house will be able to definitively answer that mystery in the affirmative!This movie is best viewed during a rainy night. Don't be surprised if you find yourself sleeping with a light on afterwards."
4,A classic haunted house film,"This film is not overly scarry by any means, but it's a well acted, well written film that never goes over the top. It is certainly one of the better haunted house flicks made (though none can top The Changeling). I only wish Hollywood would stop putting out the trash horror films they continuously spew out and would watch some of the classics and get back to basics."
4,ONE OF THE BEST HORROR MOVIES OF ALL TIME!!!!,THIS IS A SPOOKY MOVIE WITH A CREEPY ATMOSPHERE AND CAMERA TECHNIQUES THAT WILL MAKE YOUR SKIN CRAWL!!THIS IS A TRUE HORROR CLASSIC!!!!ENJOY!!!
4,Clunky but Spooky Fun,"Despite the editing flaws and some hokey camera work, this film is infinitely superior to the 1963 thriller ""The Haunting"", which seems to be accorded undue accolades simply by dint of being an earlier film.Pamela Franklin makes this film--her acting is convincing and interesting, even when the lines written for her are bad.If you are a fan of modern gore or slick, challenging, modern thrillers, this movie is not for you. But if you appreciate clunky films and classic ""Creature Double Feature"" fare, you will enjoy this film.Legend of Hell House is less about Haunting than it is about so-called ""psychic power"" and the nature of the human spirit. From that perspective it is amusing. Yes, there is a lot to forgive in this film, but unlike many other movies, it is entertaining once forgiven."
2,Not Scary,"Being a huge horror fan I was told I had to watch ""Legend of Hell House."" I have to say I am a bit underwhelmed by the film, although I hear the book is absolutely horrifying. I may have to check that out.The story starts out promising, in fact it was a bit chilling. It just fell flat toward the middle and then lost me.The premise is the oldest one in horror, the haunted house. A group of mediums and a scientist stake out the house in promise of money if they unlock the hauntings.I never connected with the film. Perhaps it was the pacing or the over the top acting, but I just didn't feel it scary at all. If you want to see a truly scary haunted house story, I'd pick up Insidious. Or if you want vintage horror, go w/ the Amityville Horror (og, of course!)."
3,DUMB ending!,"Great movie, actually AMAZINGLY good, until you reach then end, then it gets really dumb as some movies did in the 60's and early 70's."
2,Eh... just didn't age well.,"I am sure that back in the day when this film was released it was something that surely frightened the average viewer, but unfortunately this film has not aged well. I am sure that the ""PG"" rating that the filmmaker had to settle for probably can be blamed for 90% of the poor staying power that this film has. At best it is a cliche' haunted house filck with a fair amount of very dry but competent British acting. Watch it if you have nothing better to do but do not expect a four star film. Take the $7 or $8 and buy a Richard Matheson short story collection book instead. This movie just isn't very good. You might like it if you are a ""Hammer"" fan - but probably not."
2,Middle road taken,"I did not enjoy the movie as much as I thought I would. They left out alot of the parts in the book where your mind could just picture it so clear and vivid. I did this as a read aloud, slightly modified with my students. I was really excited when I found a movie to go with it, and showed the class it. It's rated PG, which for the material of the book is really a clue as to them leaving out alot of stuff. My class enjoyed most of the book and felt the movie didn't do it justice. I agree."
5,This movie will make you scared of the dark,"I first saw this movie when it first came out in 1973, and it had a different rating then. Originally based on a true story, but edited for the ""PG"" rating it still follows the storyline and can ""SCARE"" you like no modern film can. A favorite of mine and now my children.Especially good on those dark and stormy nights!"
3,Decent spooky movie,"I just watched this movie on the heels of ""The Haunting"" (1963) and it's far superior. It really isn't all that scary (I am a hard scare), but definitely more spooky and enticing than ""The Haunting."" This movie has a great set, sex appeal (Gayle Hunnicutt made me drool) and pretty good acting. Roddy McDowall's acting is probably the best, as he manages to convey much simply with looks before even speaking.I realize it's not completely fair to compare this movie to The Haunting, as they are not the same, but they are similar enough to warrant some comparison, as the premise is quite similar.I would want to see this one again, however."
5,I still cannot watch this movie alone!,"The first time I saw this film, I was scared to death. The last time I saw this movie, I was scared to death! It may be vintage horror, but it is not your typical ""haunted house"" flick. It may not have all of those glitzy, Hollywood special effects, but it still manages to chill me to the bone. For good, old-fashioned horror movie fans, this is a MUST have!"
5,One of the best horror/supernatural films ever made,"This film is a classic in every sense of the word. It has every element of supernatural and even some psychological horror. It has the spooky house, and a superb cast of characters. It is extrenmely well-written, and the direction and cinematography are truly excellent.This film marked one of the late Roddy McDowall's best screen performances, and I'm not the only one who says that. It was even mentioned by several members of the Motion Picture Academy at memorials after his death a few years ago.If you are looking for a genuinely good fright movie, you cannot go wrong with this film. It is required for any good horror movie collection."
1,Can not listen,"I can not listen to the music on Amazon - called and told to use Mozilla or Firefox - still can't hear any music.The software goes through the motions, have checked volume on EVERYTHING and still no sound comes out with Media Player or Real Player."
1,Sounds like it was taken from worn out LPs,There's surface noise and tracking distortion typical of worn out records audible on some of these tracks. It sound like Madacy just took a bunch of used Marley records and used a cheap turntable to copy them to CD. REALLY DREADFUL SOUND.
1,not the best,wow i bought this thinking i was getting 3 cds full of bob marleys greatest songs but its full of songs i never heard of..maybe i knew one or two songs at most but other than that it was a waste of money..i'm buying either legend or the VERY best of bob marley next time
2,Not what I expected ... the sound quality was terrible,"Being an avid Bob Marley fan I understand the different stages in which he recorded in, but when I think of box set I anticipate re-touched, digitally remastered or something along those lines. Not something that sounds like it was recorded in my basement with a half fuctional microphone!"
2,Don't buy it!,"I got this collection under the Name of ""Bob Marley: 40Classic Performances"" ...and the sound quality is absolutely terrible. Also ... there are songs performed by Peter Tosh and they aren't creditet. It's not at all a Bob Marley Box Set. I bought it for ""Chances are"" and ""There she goes"", and they are of course worth the low price I paied along with all the other songs. But I can't recommend this unless you are a ABSOLUTELY diehard fan and even then you will know the songs on this recordings and have them on some other record. If you want a good collection, take LEGEND."
1,Bob's never sounded worse,"I really wanted to like this. A great collection of his lesser known songs, but what's with the sound quality? It sounds like someone stuck a microcassette recorder in the door of the studio and made an album from it. There's much better recordings out there... get one of those."
2,not the best,"i was really disapointed in this cd. i bought it because i am a huge sublime fan and sublime speaks vey highly or bob marley. i enjoyed the music but the sound quality was just horrible. i was wondering why i got 3 cds for so cheap anbd i found out when i listened to it. I've heard good things about legend best of bob marley so i'm gonna pick that one up and i think you should take a look at it too, but my advice to you is dont get this cd if your looking for a quality bob cd beacause this one is deffina;tly not one of them"
3,Not the best of Bob Marley....,"Only for the absolute most die hard Marley officionado. Some of these recordings are spotty, recorded with numerous other musicians not the regular wailers band. One would do better with ""rebel music"" or ""legend"" for a representation of Mr. Marley's finest work. Cool runnings....socks"
4,Incredible Price,"This combination of a car charger and an AC charger is perfectly adequate for my Nokia 6215i and they were about $50 less than I would have paid at the Verizon store. Delivery time was within 5 business days and without any issues. If you need cell phone chargers, buy them here!"
5,Best scrub/cleanser ever!,I've used several scrubs and this one is my favorite. Not too harsh but exfoliates well enough to give my skin a nice healthy glow. I don't even use a separate facial cleanser anymore! It's all in one. The scent is very pleasant and refreshing. Well worth the price.
2,Not for Sensitive Skin,"I just purchased this cleanser and found it to be harsh. I have good skin, but it's sensitive and was quite disappointed to find my skin very tight and dry after using it. I think it's better suited for normal to oily skin.If you want a high quality skin exfoliate that doesn't leave your skin dry, check out louisebianco.com - they make a product called Derma Polish - it's not listed on their website so you have to call them to order it. It's about $25 but it's remarkable in that it removes dead skin and leaves your skin feeling moist and looking great."
2,Love Earth Science but HATE this product,"I am a BIG Earth Science fan and LOVE their facewash and moisturizers (been using them for years) but this scrub creme I DO NOT like. It smells bad and it's just a thick, sticky, gooey, gross mess. There is barely any materials in it to ""scrub"" -- I guess that is why it's called gentle -- but I don't notice any exfoliating results like I achieve with other exfoliating cleansers. It's sticky on your face and is hard to wash off. I highly recommend Earth Science but NOT this particular product!"
5,Go Ahead Richard!,"This album is one that will never go out of style. Richard writes songs of ministry that will minister to everyone with songs like Total Praise, Angels Watching Over Me, Bless The Lord, and most of all Thank You! The anointing on this album greets me everytime I turn it on. I recommend that every gospel lover have this album. Also, if you do not get the cd, the video is all the more worthwhile."
5,An Uplifting Blessing,I really enjoyed every song on this CD. Angels is such a comforting song!Thank you for this wonderful blessing.
4,Four and half Stars for this masterpiece of work,"Since buying this cd, Ricahard Smallwood has become apart of my life everyday. This master piece of work has songs on this cd that touches my heart and makes me think. Like songs like ""Total Praise"", ""Bless the lord"" and my favorite on the cd ""Thank You"". I have encourage all my friends and family to go out and but this cd, to experience the feelings I got from it. I can't wait until he comes out with his next cd."
1,The Worst Film of a Poorly Planned Exhibit You'll Ever View.,"To view all that is wrong with ""Destroy All Rational Thought"",simply skip to the interview with the creators. They fumble through weak excuses of why you hate what you just saw. Lack of money, art-school student film work, bad blood between Gysin's old friends, no shows, and late arrivals. Burroughs on the cover, but with a shaky, poorly recorded 3 minute interview being his only contribution to the film. Purchase ""Thee Films"" to experience the true brilliance of Gysin/Burroughs. I was very disappointed in this DVD."
5,Excellent product.,"This product was like I expected it to be, every song was pleasing to here. Great collection of songs. Thanks!"
3,Poor photos spoil a good book.,"Books on design make or break their reputation on two factors: text content (tips, advice, project descriptions) and visuals (photos, drawings). Altoon draws on his extensive experience to give a fairly good discussion of shopping center design in the international scene. He contends that while some components or details may be exported successfully to other countries, overall concepts do not usually travel well. He then discusses the components individually and provides a comprehensive portfolio of shopping centers in different cultural milieus. (However, if you're a designer who's had some experience doing shopping centers, the discussion probably has little new to offer you.)The text, however, cannot make up for the very poor printing quality of the photographs. Almost all of the photos are somewhat blurred - imagine the fifth color copy of a copy of an original. Such a pity since the book ends up less than half effective because of this."
5,Adorable mugs,"I purchased these as a Chrismas gift. The mugs are a nice size, crafted well, and very cute, so cute I had trouble giving the mugs away."
3,Rhubarb Spread,"I should have read the label on this: It is a spread, not jam. The flavor is acceptable, but I've been looking for a good rhubarb (not rhubarb-strawberry) jam since Bonne Maman stopped making theirs several years ago. I'm not rating my disappointment, though--even as a spread I thought this was average. I've also tried Andresy's rose jan (3 stars) and fig jam (4 stars)."
1,Very disappointed,My daughter received this for Christmas. I was thrilled she got it until she began to play with it. The pegs are WAY TO SHORT and do not stay in. It is a disgrace they have allowed this to stay on the market....don't waste your hard earned $$$
4,Fun toy,"Fun, but not as easy to put together as it appears. Not as sturdy as the one I had when I was little, but with 4 sides to create, much more fun!"
4,IT WAS A GIFT HE LOVED,I gave this as a gift to a 4 year old boy. He had played it before and wanted it and was very happy when he received it. It was nice that all 3 boys could play at the same time becuase they all had a side (with one extra side).
3,Disappointed Grandchildren,"I have to agree with the other reviewers who wrote indicating their disappointment with the lack of refills for the Lite Brite Cube. Unfortunately, it wasn't until after Santa made his deliveries and we tried to play with the toy that we discovered that the regular refills don't fit the Lite Brite Cube. A word of warning on the package would have been appreciated. And yes, finding the refills has been extremely difficult, and also, the Hasbro website only says that ""refills are beginning to ship in early December 2002."" Unfortunately, that doesn't explain to disappointed children. Hasbro should have made the Cube refills available much sooner. The toy has been around for awhile now, since I bought this one about three or four months ago in a round of early Christmas shopping."
1,What's the purpose...,of having a toy like this when there are no refills (I looked everywhere)? My daughter loves it and used up the included pages in 3 days. So now she has a xmas present (good thing I didn't buy it for her) that is basically worthless and takes up space. I'm thinking about buying a regular lite brite on ebay and the refills to go with it and chucking the cube in the trash.
4,Refills are available,I have searched for the refills for this toy and have found them on hasbro's website. The website is pretty easy to find with a search of playskool. The refills cost around [$$$].
1,LAME!,"This toy is so lame. The paper sheets that come with it are hard to keep on. The pegs fall out unless you use the papers, and then they still don't usually stay in. The pegs that come in a row(to save time) only fit diagonally, and stay in even worse than the single pegs. This toy is super lame and useless. Don't waste your money."
3,Didn't last. Pegs fall out.,My 6 year old daughter received this as a christmas gift. After we put it together she used all of the pictures that came with it in a very short time. Unfortunately the pegs fell out easily. There aren't enough pictures and I thought they could be a little more complex. After a couple more uses the sides fell apart. We fixed it and it fell apart again. We fixed it again and it fell apart again. What a dissapointment. I thought it would be fun but now it is just a mess of parts. The original lite brite would be a better choice.
2,Hi! Just me again!!,"I would like to add this to my review please! After 1 week, my girls still enjoy playing with this, though we have used all of the contained designs. I can't find a refill pack for this cube model(screens are smaller) so have adapted the regular sized refill--with MARGINAL results.Hmm..wonder why there is no refill pack? I guess the company figures that our kids will: break it, lose most of the pegs, or become bored with it, by the time the contained designs have been used!! Note: I have downgraded my review!!"
5,Fire the whole marketing department!,"What were they thinking of when they made this cube without having refills available??? I purposely didn't buy this because of the helpful review about unavailability of refills, but my daughter's aunt bought it. My three children, ages 7, 8, and 10, had a great time--for about 2 hours!--using this item. It is great being able to do more than one picture at a time. But when they are done, they are done!! No more pictures. We tried making our own with construction paper but that's no fun ..."
4,Unfortunately no refills!,"As so many other reviewers have noted, I have found it very frustrating that no refills are available for this item. My sons loved it, but it is now on a shelf until more refills can eventually be found. I did go on the playskool website to order and received a letter that they aren't even available as a replacement part. My advice is to buy the old fashioned version, where refill kits are plentiful!"
5,awesome and amazing.,I choose this toy for my granddaughter because she needed some additional stimulation and education and this did it for her. She is 4 years old and has a younger sister who loves doing what she does all the time and this is perfect for sharing as well.
4,"Fun, and educational toy","I bought this for my 4 year old son. I remember having the orignal Lite Brite as a child, and it is much nicer having 4 sides! Once we finish a picture now we can leave it up to look at, and still get to work on a new picture! Also we have kept all the little pegs together thanks to the little drawers it has to store them in. I've also found it educational because it has become another tool that we use to help him with his colors and letters. As well lets them use their imagination and create their own art.The only problem I have with it is that it does not come with enough pictures or blank pages to make in my opinion. And the refills for the orignal Lite Brite do not work with the Lite Brite cube. Unless some are made soon that we can buy, this toy may end up sitting collecting dust. As I'm sure he will become bored of the same 8 pictures it came with. Beyond needing refill pictures, we've really enjoyed this toy. And gives us another project that we can do together."
1,Where's the refills!?!?!?!,"My son got this for his birthday. He loves to play with it. Unfortunately, we can't find refills anywhere. The Toys R Us store claims that they carry them, but are out of stock. We've been to the store numerous times and they've always been out of stock. The Hasbro website is useless too. VERY DISAPPOINTING. This would be a 5 star toy if we could find refills!"
2,Short-lived fun,"My two children received the Lite Brite cube as a present for Christmas. They absolutely loved it...for a whole two hours! After this, they had gone through the limited number of patterns that the cube comes with. We went out to the store today to purchase more patterns, to find out that they don't exist. How disappointing! Now we have a cube that does not store away easily and has no play value left. To top it off, we tried to make a picture free form without the paper and the pegs fell right out. We had almost finished writing out my daughter's name on the cube with pegs- one fell out and started an avalanche of pegs until they were all on the floor. This was particularly upsetting for my 6 year old daughter who spent approximately 10 minutes writing out her name. Stick with the original lite-brite if you absolutely want to get one. The cube seems like a nice idea in theory, but that's about all it amounts to in the end."
4,Disappointed................,"I'm with the rest of you....this toy is so much fun....""Santa"" just brought it for my daughter for Christmas. I am very disappointed to find out that I cannot purchase refills. I wish I would have looked into this BEFORE ""Santa"" brought it, because I would have just gone for the original Lite Bright instead."
3,REFILLS???,"I also agree that this toy would be perfect if it had refills. I made the mistake of buying regular lite brite refills only to learn that they wouldn't work. I am now searching for refills so that my children, ages 4 and 6, can continue to use it. I hope they will be available soon!"
4,Good toy,This was a great Christmas present for my 6 yo and 4 yo to share. They both loved it and it is easy to operate. I do agree that there need to be more sheets included. We ran out the first day. There is nowhere to purchase them online anywhere or any store.
2,Not fun!,This toy was not a hit with my kids. The pegs that hold the paper in each side constantly fall out. The game only comes with 8 sheets of cover page which runs out very quickly. Have not found a re-fill in the stores. This toy has been shelved.
4,just a little puzzled,"the toy is good, educational and pretty durable however we have gone looking at about 5 different stores for re-fil pictures and cant find them anywhere. There are not many pictures in here-they go fast-esp. when you have 5 children that want to use it-the reason we got it in the first place-so that at least 4 of them could at one time. Now the pictures are used and we cant find more-it WAS fun-but what are we supposed to do now?"
4,Looking for refills!,"I loved this when I was a little girl. I think this is a great toy. It helps kids with coordination, colors, shapes etc., but like many others, I wish there were refills!"
5,A little dissapointed...,"we love the new ""light bright cube""...i grew up with ""light bright"" and really wanted my own children to have one! what a great idea...however; the people [the store] informed me that i could get the re-fills on-line, which i obviously can't! ...one happy ""cube"" owner..."
4,Definitely will captivate your little artists!,I loved this as a kid in the 70's so bought it for my 4&6 year olds. The pros: cube design is great! Kids can work on separate pix simultaneously! Plenty of pegs are included! The cons:Pegs are smaller and can easily fall out of screen during a creation. Only 8 pre-printed pages included (spurring arguments over the butterfly design) Not as sturdy as I remember! Maybe Playskool can work on this! I can tell you that my girls were anxious to start new designs-- instead of turning on the tube and watching cartoons! (2 days in a row!)
1,PLEASE DO NOT WASTE MONEY BUY ORGINAL,I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY DAUGHTER LAST YEAR FOR CHRISTMAS AND I WISH I WOULD HAVE BOUGHT HER THE ORGINAL LITE-BITE NOT THIS ONE. THE PEGS HAVE TO BE USED WITH THE BLACK PAPER ON BACK. IF NOT THE PEGS JUST FALL RIGHT OUT. AND WHAT FUN IS IT WHEN THE PAPER IS FALLING OUT OR TO GO BY THEIR DESIGNS ON THE PAPER???? I WOULD BUY THE ORGINAL WE USED WHEN WE WERE KIDS NOT THIS NEW HI-TECH ONE WHICH IS MORE MONEY!!!!!!
1,Stay away from this product!!!,I thought this would be a great toy my son and i could play together. We both get frustrated since the pegs easily fall out; they don't stay put. I dont' recommend this product AT ALL. STAY AWAY FROM IT!!
2,Lite Brite disappointment,"I ordered the Lite-Brite cube for my granddaughters for Christmas. They are 5 and 3 and love art work and projects. We were all excited to make the pictures. However, it was such a frustration as the pegs kept falling out, and there weren't enough colors to do the two pictures the girls had chosen. It just wasn't like the original Lite-Brite. I am sorry that we purchased it...."
1,Lite Brite was a huge dissapointment,"This was our 5 year old daughters Christmas present from Santa Claus. What a horrible present. The pegs do not stay in and if you are working on one side, you will end up knocking the pegs out of the other side! Absolutely horrible purchase and I am hugely disappointed."
5,Like the four sides,"4 and 5 yo love the box approach since both can work different sides. Plenty of pegs, but limited number of templates. Recommend photocopying some templates before first use to avoid running out of sheets."
2,Refills!,"Like others, I am very frustrated that there were only 8 pictures included with the cube. The refills are impossible to find, and Hasbro.com only states they have a refill pack, not which one. Ebay has them for $16.00 which is almost as much as the whole cube. I also agree that the pages are hard to keep up without putting in quite a few pegs and that there is no storage for extra sheets (not that I have any!).... Wouldn't buy again or recommend to anyone unless refill pages were readily available..."
4,Plug in to outlet!!,I have not opened the box yet because I didn't realize it is NOT battery operated. I am not too sure if I am comfortable with leaving my 4 1/2 year old alone playing with and toy that is plugged into an electrical outlet.
3,Make sure you get the Canon-brand cartridge,Be careful that you get what you order. I ordered a Canon E20 cartridge from Amazon.com but ordered it from ANTOnline rather than Amazon (who didn't have it in stock). I was careful to read the description that I was ordering a Canon-brand cartridge and not a 3rd-party replacement. ANTOnline shipped an inferior replacement-brand cartridge. ANTOnline did not respond when I contacted them. Amazon.com originally denied my claim that ANTOnline shipped the wrong item. I appealed by telephone and Amazon refunded my money.
4,Leo's review on Cannon E20,The E20 was delivered quickly as indicated in the e-mail. It provides much quality as the one came with the PC150 Copier.
5,WORKS LIKE A CHARM,I purchased my Cannon copier right after retiring and getting a computer. The toner for the Canon copier is so simple to change and the copies are more brilliant the the ones made using the toner that comes with the copier. I primarily use my copier for receipts and/or statements received from health care providers. So it gets very little use but the copies are cheaper to make than those made on a computer printer and they come out almost as nice.
2,Canon toner,"When it arrived it did not print (no or little ink). Upon calling, it was replaced, but it still wasn't as good as the same product bought at Staples."
4,Good price for the product,I just used 6 of these and they worked OK. I do have a beld in the flue liner and it did not bend all the way. I was able to hand clean the last 2 feet from the bottom. I was also worried they would unscrew and get stuck but none came loose.
1,not what i expected,"The ad said ""rods"", I got one rod. I cant clean my chimney with one rod. I'm probably going to return this ""rod"" and buy the set from someone else"
5,"the feeling, bitter-sweet is defined in this novel","Found this book at a hosp. book sale. I was drawn to the forlorn look of the young women on the cover.Took me two years to actually pick this book up to read, and only two days to finish. The author so completely draws you into this familys life.It twists and turns and at times seems to actually repeat certain events. But at the same time these turns help clarify the emotions.Every character was defined and understood without a lot of rhetoric. This was without a doubt the best novel I have ever read that left me understanding the meaning of ""a great read"""
3,She was afraid of his love now....,"From back cover: It had taken Aline five years to get over the pain and humiliation caused by Dominic Lietch's harsh rejection of her teenage love. The foolish young girl had become a sensible young woman, so when Dominic returned unexpectedly to Scotland, Aline was dismayed to find that her growing up had not changed her feelings for him. She was determined to get away from his dangerous magnetism before he could hurt her again. Dominic, however, seemed equally determined to make her stay....."
4,For Loyal Fans Only,More information on the Man than one thought possible. This book is for the truly dedicated fans of Kubrick. Photo stills are taken from the same film that you saw in the theater. Beautiful. The only Big disappointment was that my book did NOT contain the film strip that came in the first printing of this book. The small print neglects to tell you that! This book is made very well and should be cherished for generations.
4,A reminder for those who wants this new print.,"Just got the book today. I don't ever get to see the original prints so I dont' know if there's anything difference compare to this newly released copy which now I own. I want to make sure you do aware of this.....THIS NEW 2008 RELEASE DO NOT COME WITH THE 2001 FILMSTRIP AND THE AUDIO INTERVIEW CD.However, if you look around the internet, you might be able to find the CD material.*wink*Please don't ask me for a copy. I don't own one.I give it 4/5 star for not having the CD and filmstrip. Else, it's a must have for Kubrick fans."
3,Disappointing,"It was nice to see a lot of the images i've never seen before but a lot of my favorite images were between the creases of the bind. The print quality was poor dingy and dark, at least on my copy, very disappointed in the quality especially from taschen who usually do great work. But the price is good."
4,Filmstrip Not As Good As Book,"I had high hopes for the piece of 70mm film included with the book, since 2001 is one of my favorite movies, and is my reason for buying this book. Unfortunately, I must have gotten one of the crappiest images in the whole movie. It's a sun/star blob on a murky background, from the end part of the movie. Jeez - I thought the worst I could get was part of the press conference scene. At least that would have had something recognizable in it.It's still a great book, but I expected a better film strip. So don't get too excited about this bonus. Apparently the Kubrick connection matters more than its content."
3,Disappointing but only at first glance,"Am glad that I ordered it and have it, but (first-glance impression) it's too heavy, and most of the excess weight is devoted to a tedious excess of full-page stills from films without annotations or captions, and the by-far most interesting photos are too small and the most interesting texts of all are in a font that's absurdly tiny for such an enormous book. Still, it's a nice, albeit unwieldy, souvenir of a filmmaker whose career I followed with great interest having met him briefly at its very start."
5,A treasure for Kubrick fans,This book is a must have for Kubrick fans. Without a doubt the most detailed book on the mans work including rarities that I do not want to spoil for others. This is one of my favorite books that I glance at a few times every week (im a kubrick fan).
4,drum up grade,The drum has larger cooling fins than the bottom of the line drums I got from the discount parts store.
2,returned... not what I expected,If I had had an opportunity to view the pages up close I would have known that it wasn't what I wanted. The WilsonJones S490 Visitor Register is what I was looking for and found.
3,its alright...,"Easy to use, works okay, UV reflective, after buying this I found that automobile liquid cooling/ anti-freeze works way better, plus its WAY cheaper. Using automobile liquid cooling/ anti-freeze dropped my CPU temperature by 8-10 degrees, rather than using this coolant."
5,Awsome...,"Perfect. My computer used to get so hot and used to get frozen.. but.. after I use this product.. the temp. never goes higher... really a great product..Cons. You know... this is a UV sencitive product. So, I preffer this bottle to be brown collored or placed in a fully coverd box.. anyways... Just keep it in a closet for better profomance."
4,missed opportunity,"Another decent set from A&E, but despite the packaging offering ""seven complete, uncut...color episodes"", the two-part story THE FICTION MAKERS is presented here as the compliled film version - what a pity..."
1,Terrible product...,"This dvd is pretty bad. I've seen the online trailer for the kino dvd release and the picture quality on the streaming quicktime movie was better then the picture quality on the ""triple feature"" dvd."
3,19th century Orchestration,"Rimsky-Korsakov's treatise deals with many of the common issues of orchestration but is steeped in the music of the 19th century when it was written. The modern student of orchestration needs to study orchestral techniques of the 20th century as well as the techniques of the earlier musical periods. Another failure of this treatise is that Rimsky-Korsakov only uses extracted examples from his own compositions. This limits the breadth of the work and provides no understanding of other composer's methods. Overall this book has some useful information provided by a clever orchestrator but should be seen more as an addendum to the broader, more modern, more detailed and less egocentric works of Piston and Adler."
5,Tunes for dancin' and chillin',"I first heard this disc at a house party 3 years ago and I STILL turn it on when I'm making dinner, getting ready to go out, driving around town or funkin' it up. Without a dime in my pocket for a concert ticket, I once hid in the woods behind the outdoor venue where Maceo was appearing with some friends and wine and lived it up anyway. Dancing to these tunes with a group of friends can't be beat and the combos with Rebirth are smokin'. I have shared this album with everyone I know and almost all of them have run out for their own copy. Beware when you introduce this disc at parties, though. We have had an empty-case scare almost every time, but it always finds its way home."
1,NEVER PLACED THE ORDER,NEVER EVER ORDERED THIS PRODUCT BUT IT WAS PLACED AS AN ORDER SO I HAD CALL AND THIS REMOVER FROM MY CREDIT CARD THANKS TOO AMOZON REP.
5,fantastic discovery,I loved this cd -- what a fascinating collection of artists. Great exposure to an interesting cross section of sounds and artists.
1,Blue and Grass should not be together in this title,"I thought I was getting a bluegrass CD, but this was a HUGE disappointment, for pete sake, there are drums on most of the tracks. Out of 14 songs, I would only want to hear two of them again, not worth the price paid."
5,An outstanding book,This litle book about the Gospel of John is a gold mine for an understanding of the theological claims in the gospel - a truly outstanding work.
3,Not bad,"I had a hard time understanding the text at times just because of the writing style, but it was a good story overall."
2,a strange story!,"Hmmm . . .This is the story of Tess, a high-powered executive for a firm which specializes in raising charitable funds, who needs to hire a guy to stave off the efforts of a determined matchmaker; and of Shayde, the mysterious guy who shows up to take the job. But Shayde is more than he seems (With a name like that, what would you expect?). He is tangled up with the Cupid Committee, a shadowy group of individuals also determined to matchmake. And Shayde's got other secrets . . . This is a strange story, actually, especially because Tess seems convinced that the only way to stave off matchmakers is by convincing the world she's having an affair. Bizarre. The second star is partly because I was impressed that Leclaire could keep all the complicated details of this mess straight! And there are a few surprises along the way."
5,"Elvis The Alternate Aloha Concert 2 , The King Is Still Here",Elvis The Alternate Aloha Concert I'm Trying To Get Hold Of It But I Have Not Had Any Luk What So Ever The Last Review I Wrote Was A Big Matsake Because It Was Not The Alternate I Got Hold Of It Was The Original Video Of Elvis Aloha From Hawaii But To The Alternate Aloha Concert I Think It Was Great And I'm Still Going To Try And Get Hold Of It Because It's A Great Concert One Of The Best I've Seen . CLINTON HORTON
2,1973-1977,"In January 1973, Elvis filmed his awesome Aloha From Hawaii TV show. THAT is the video to buy for a great look at Elvis. He plays the same songs as in this show, but he plays better in the real concert. Here, he is tense, boring, unprepared and stiff. He completely forgets ""Burning Love,"" he has mistakes in a lot of his other songs, and he does LESS songs than in the live broadcast.The Elvis presented here is more along the lines of the 1977 Elvis, you know, the one who skipped verses of all the songs in ""Elvis In Concert."" 1977 brought a fat, nervous, unfun Elvis, much like the Elvis here -- nervous and unfun. Do yourself a favor and spare this for the TV broadcast. (I bought them both around the same time on VHS but could certainly live w/o this one.)"
3,B CAREFUL! ONLY FOR COLLECTORS!,"CANT BELIEVE IDIOTS (THIEFS) KEEP ON RELEASING SOMETHING WHEN ITS NOT COMPLETE, IM SO LONESOME I COULD CRY IS MISSIN~! SO IT WAS ONLY RELEASED TO MAKE DOUGH, SHAME!OTHERWISE HIS REHEARSAL ROCKS MUCH BETTER THAN ORIGINAL, LIKE LAS VEGAS AUG 1969 EP ALWAYS SHOULD HAVE USED THAT STYLE!"
5,The Pool of Fire,"The novel The Pool of fire is a very enjoyable book to read. It held my interest because of it's thrilling rush of action, which John Christopher has a great style of this technique.In the novel a few favorite passages were made. As a tripod destroys Will's boat while they are traveling in the war. This interested me because it put a true meaning to true meaning ""up a creek without a paddle"" and all the gear that was saved had to be carried. Another part of the book that interested me was when Will had to escape slavery by going down a sewage pipe. The reason this drew my attention was because of the humor.In The Pool of Fire John Christopher has a great way of keeping my interest. He managed this by always has something big or major going on.As I read this novel I learned some great vocabulary. I would also recommend this book to any body because it's so action packed.RyanCreston Ca."
4,Sci-fi story that stands the test of time...,"This is the final book in the Tripods trilogy by John Christopher. It does a great job of wrapping up the story and explaining how the free men take on the Tripods in their golden cities.In this book the rebel faction of free humans works to recruit others to their cause; they also spend time learning some of the technologies of the ancient people. A plan is put together to infiltrate the Tripod cities and destroys the Masters.Fast paced and intriguing, this book is a great conclusion to the series. Will still struggles with his brashness and lack of foresight; Beanpole is as clever as ever. A quick read and a great series conclusion; this book really stands the test of time."
5,EPIC,"THE POPULAR SERIES FINALLY CONCLUDES IN A SWEEPING EPIC THAT SPANS OVER THE COURSE OF SIX YEARS. FASCINATING, MANKIND FINNALY GETS HIS REVENGE ON THE MASTERS."
4,Better than the other books in the triology!,"This book, The Pool of Fire by John Christopher, is an adventure/fantasy/sci-fi book. Will, Henry, Beanpole and Fritz team up. Why? Because, very soon, the Tripods will kill all of the people on Earth. The four-some are split up, and they are paired with five or six others. They all must conquer the three cities of the Tripods. Told from Will's point of view, this story is the very picture of adventure and excitement. Will, Henry, Beanpole, and Fritz come up with a wonderful invention that might actually conquer the third city that was not yet destroyed! Will the Tripods conquer the Earth? Will the third city get conquered? Read this exiting adventure story to find out what happens!"
5,My kids love this!,I bought the book for my 18 month old son and he has gotten really good at putting the Cheerios in the correct places. My 3 and 5 year old daughters love it too. The book is really cute and sturdy. And the kids get a healthy snack while they play.
3,Do you have any?,"This book is just a few pages long, featuring a total of six pictures of animals. Each picture has a few slots where you can fit a Cheerio to fill in something round that is missing (like eyes, spots, etc.)The funniest has to be the seal page, which reads, ""One seal needs two balls to juggle. Do you have any?"""
4,read and eat,Cheerios are the essential snack for little ones. My daughter loved putting the cheerios on the pages to make the picture.. then eating them all. It's something that no other book does and its built well to handle being wiped off and cleaned.
2,The worst of Hot Body,"I have purchased several Hot Body DVD's, this is certainly the worst I've bought. The women are really average and I'm really not sure what is supposed to be kinky about any of the stuff they do. A major disappointment."
5,The best chess book I have ever bought,"This book taught me how to prepare an opening repertoire. First I adopted all the suggested opening lines for black and white, and then I improved and accommodated them to my own playing style. It is a book I consult regularly. Although I bought this book in 1997, I still keep on reading it. It is a very good book."
1,Repertoire is incomplete,"The Black side of the repertoire is missing any information on when White follows 1.d4 with anything else besides 2.c4, i.e. the Colle System, London System, Trompowski, Veresov, etc. Therefore I consider the repertoire incomplete and cannot recommend it."
4,Knowledge is power,"I have been a martial artist for 19 years, and this is the kind of knowledge that masters didn't pass on to their students until the students were ready for it after at least a decade. After watching this video, I watched 'Enter the Dragon' and recognized a couple of these techniques being applied. Granted, you need a black belt's skills to apply these techniques, but scary/wonderful stuff indeed. I hope I never have the need to apply the skills I learned from this video. This video should be rated ""Mature"" because it teaches the ultimate weaknesses of the human body. And only mature people should know those."
2,Overpriced!,"I bought these and at the same time bought some zwipes brand. While these are larger, they are the same cloth as the zwipes but are much more expensive. Not worth the cost compared to the zwipes."
2,Good towels but they come with a label attached that scratches!,"These are normal quality microfiber towels, nothing special, but not bad either. My complaint is that each one has a label attached to it that can scratch and it's not at all easy to remove it. Very poor idea to include a label on each towel. I cut the labels off as close to the cloth as possible and am careful to fold that portion of the towel over when I'm using it on my car, etc.But I've found the exact same quality towels at my local auto supply store for about the same price and they had no label sewn on which is much better."
3,Not for you with bad knees,"This is a good variation from the other things I am doing, once or twice a week. The only thing I would change would be all the lunges he does..ouch, my knees! Don't have trouble with them usually, but they can get sore with this one. My husband does have bad knees and can not do this one..wouldn't suggest for everyone."
2,Really is boring...,"When this dvd arrived I watched and though it was great, not boring as some reviewers said. But then I do it... It is really boring. I have 6 years of strenght training and regular aerobig training too, so, maybe this dvd was not to me, but maybe to a sedentary people it is ok. I like of exercises with only weight body some times, but this dvd is not able to defy aperson with some training. A much better option, much more dinamic and much harder workout is Dolph Lundgreen's MAXIMUM POTENTIAL. There is only in VHS,but I transfer it to dvd:Dolph Lundgren: Maximum Potential Workout [VHS]"
4,What we have here,"The original book, ""A book-lover's holidays in the open"" by Theodore Roosevelt (1858-1919), was published by Charles Scribner's Sons, in New York, in 1916. It is not in copyright. Contents include: A cougar hunt on the rim of the Grand Canyon.--Across the Navajo desert.--The Hopi snake-dance.--The ranchland of Argentina and southern Brazil.--A Chilean rodeo.--Across the Andes and northern Patagonia.-- Wild hunting companions.--Primitive man; and the horse, the lion, and the elephant.--Books for holidays in the open.--Bird reserves at the mouth of the Mississippi.--A curious experience.--Appendices.The volume tries to reconcile hunting with biological conservation, as well as reading. Information on Roosevelt's South American trip to Argentina, Chile, and Brazil that is not available in his other writings can be gleaned here."
5,Excellent beginner's introduction to cryptic crosswords,"The American crosswording public is largely unfamiliar withthe cryptic crossword, and are baffled when one turns up.No more! Cox and Rathvon introduce us to this clever andentertaining form of wordplay, taking a very effectivephased approach, teaching us the tricks one by one untilwe're ready to set off on our own.The book also includes eight practice puzzles and 65 full-sizedpuzzles, graded by difficulty.Anyone who loves word games will want this book. But beware! You'll become hookedon cryptic crosswords; don't say I didn't warn you!"
5,Very fun,"I got this book as a gift and it was a hit. Cryptic crosswords, if you've never done them, are a real hoot and having a primer is a must before tackling them. This provides the primer and said ""hoot""."
4,from a high school teacher,"This book has been enormously useful to me in the high school classroom. I think the people who say it is useless are missing the point--this book is not supposed to present new information! What it does is allow my students to understand some of the specific study skills and to practice them under my guidance before I expect them to move on to apply the skills independently to some of our more difficult content. Thank you, Diane Vener, for saving me a lot of prep time to create my own materials! The book was well worth the purchase price."
1,BULL S*@^,This book is worthless. It gives the reader very little. All the information that is given is common knowledge. I question the authors credentials. This book is a waste of time and money to read. There is no new information here. All there is cliches about teaching. Do not buy this book
3,Great Compactness but Low Number of Copies,"Great cartridge for the Canon PC785 and PC700 series copiers. It is small. The cartridge does need to be shaken lightly, frequently to get even toner distribution and also will last longer if you shake it vigorously at the end of its near time lifespan. Also, the number of copies per cartridge isn't quite as much as larger copier's but is worth it overall in its use and economy."
3,Item as presented,This toner cartridge was exactly as presented in the ad. No problem with this transaction at all. Will pay from this vendor in the future.
