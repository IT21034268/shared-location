2,Fair book,"Didn't anyone else get from the very first page that this story was partly fictionalized? Who in their right mind believed that he would've been able to board an airplane in that condition? And his friend ""Leonard"" seemed a little too contrived...the hard mobster with the heart of gold...come on!!! Not a great book and not a bad book. I just admire him for getting under Oprah's skin! Not an Oprah fan whatsoever! And he wrote a book and made millions--GOOD FOR HIM!"
2,Eh...okay,"Man, do I get tired of these books. I get it, drugs are really bad and there is a built in plot of self desctuction and partial redemption.This books, sadly, reads no different. From the tone of the narrative, I expect a sequel sooner rather than later.It will be called ""A Bazillion Little Pieces""Oprah will have second thoughts."
2,Good Luck Mr. Frey,"Thousands of alcoholics and drug addicts may read this book and get hope that they too can make it without AA and God. Most of them, maybe all, will die. Thanks Mr. Frey."
3,Fooling the reading public,Author has a tremendous imagination. He should regret having claimed that the entire account was true.
5,raw,"the only word to descibe this incredible story is 'raw' Frey writes in a way that hooks you from the begining and doesn't let you go. he wrote as it was, nothing more nothing less, raw details of what he was thinking, feeling and seeing. amazing!"
3,"Promising, but still ho-hum","James Frey's memoir of addiction gets off to a harrowing start and manages to sustain the momentum through the first half. It is stark, bold, and wholly unsentimental. But then things start to slide. James' parents visit him at the clinic where the reader is treated to page after page of sentimentalized touchy-feely ""you don't understand my feelings"" psychobabble that reads like an Afterschool Special, albeit with an edge. Things pick up again toward the end but by this time the shock of the new has worn off and it's become just another memoir by just another former addict."
1,Another Oprah scam book & fraud,Zero stars. I cannot believe Oprah supported this book filled with lies and fabrications.I want my money back Oprah. I believed you but you are a liar.
4,"Good to read of overcomers, but did not hold interest!","I read this book because Oprah recommended it and she usually has Sixth Sense when it comes to good books!I wish I had ordered Martha Stewart's new book instead.Although Frey is a good writer--even masterful in places--too much of the book was repetitious.One thing he does well is flesh out his characters so they become real, enabling his readers to sympathize with them. I felt the pain of his characters, but the joy of reading about the ""overcomers"" was the highlight of the book. And his dialogue seems realistic.While I think this book might benefit some people with addictive personalities--in danger of becoming addicted to alcohol and/or drugs--I could only give it a 4-star. It's not for everyone."
3,Readable,"This is a decent,readable book about a privileged white boy hitting bottom then being picked up by his parents. The writing is perfectly adequate and, thankfully, lacks some of the pretension of the other privileged white boys that Frey so famously wants to tear down. Ultimately, it's a bit whiney and, for my buck, Jerry Stahl's PERMANENT MIDNIGHT is a much better, and more honest read."
1,lowest rating possible,"This is a sad, pathetic work of FICTION. I read it with a definite bias against the author from the beginning; it was my book club's monthly selection. I borrowed the copy I read, because I did not want to contribute in any way to the author or publisher. As I read this book, I hid it inside a magazine. I did not want anyone to see me reading this garbage and assume it's worth buying. I expected to glean some small nugget of truth regarding Frey's addiction and experience getting sober, but I was sadly mistaken."
3,"Great explanation of addiction, but I do not like James","Hazelden saved my life. It costs ALOT of money to go there. James is a damn whiner. And the funny thing is, the Tao Ching book IS basically the steps... Just without the Higher Power part. I could go on and on, but he is just not worth my time. All AA says is to:1. admit problem2. believe in something/someone to help you3. clean house4. make amends5. help othersThat is ALL AA is about. People try to complicate it and all this stuff. Thank God I had a sober uncle who knew Bill W. (founder of AA) to tell me the simplicity of AA. And the fact that this guy profits from this book kills me. I don't see him helping anyone but himself. If he truly cares about his friends, then he should go out and give back what was so freely given to him."
2,Over-rated,"Lots of drama about being a junkie and detoxing, not enough on living clean for a long time and no where enough explaining WHY he was a drinker at age 10. I can respect him chosing not to do AA, not doing the ""higher power"" thing, but if anyone could have used steps 4 and 11, it's him!"
1,Frey's Lies into second book...,"It's a work of fiction, was shopped to publishers that way and finally made money as a bogus biography. What parts are true? You'll never know... so reading this as an account of his time in rehab is a complete guessing game as to what is truthful! Even worse, he leads into the continuation of this ""story"" in his next book ""My Friend Leonard"", with completely false imprisonment! His writing style and descriptions are quite well done... but of fictional events or truthful events??? You'll never find out!"
4,Good stuff!,"Having lived with an alcholic for 23 years, I could well relate to the story line in A Million Pieces. Listening to the details of him hitting his rock bottom and where he went from there was a true page turner. I couldn't put the book down. A must read."
5,Worst case scenerio,"This book is about what the worst case scenerio would be for an alcoholic, addict and criminal. I, too, have to compare James Frey to Augusten Burroughs. He has a real and true style of writing and I thought the book was excellent. I could not put it down. The part about the dentist office made my teeth hurt! I am just so glad he is still writing, because it means he is still alive! Highly recommend this book for anyone who wants to learn more about addiction or just enjoys reading true stories that read like a novel."
4,I loved this book,James Frey tells a moving story. I recommend this book to anyone dealing with their addiction or who has a loved one who is confronting addiction. I could not put the book down.
4,A Realistic Look at Addiction,"This book is not easy to read. Not in content, not in style. James Frey's story is a realistic account of addiction and recovery rather than the standard issue movie version. It is gritty, difficult, at time nauseating in it's descriptiveness of the depravities committed by and to addicts. I do find the style to be distracting from the story. His insistence on capitalizing certain nouns, eg. ""I walked down the Hall to my Room"" rather captured my attention far more than the plot. The single word ""chain of consciousness"" type writing is a distraction as well, I found myself skipping most of those parts in order to get to the real meat of the story. Overall, it is a good read, not an easy read and certainly not a comfortable read, but well worth investing time in."
3,An entertaining work of fiction,"As everyone knows by now, many of the details of this story were completely fabricated by Frey. That being said, if taken as a work of fiction, it is an entertaining page turner. If this book had been labeled ""based on a true story,"" I think it would have stood up to all of the criticisms and Frey would not have come out looking so bad.This is a story of someone with a terrible past and nothing to live for. He somehow manages to find redemption and purpose in life while brazenly ignoring all of the advice given to him by the experts at rehab. If you are interested in taking a peek into the mind of an addict, this book is for you. If you are an addict looking for inspiration to stay sober, I recommend that you look elsewhere."
2,Tahnks Oprah (sic),"I have used drugs (primerly marijauna) for quite a few years now, and have never been in a drugs rahabilitation facility or had my life adversly affected due to my drug usage. Having read the first few pages of this book, I would venture the authors problems stem more from his abrasive, self induldgent, self agrandizing personality than anything to do with his intake of illegal narcotics!"
5,"Controversy aside, this is a great read","I enjoyed reading this book and was slightly disappointed when I learned of the discrepencies in this memoir. However, after hearing all sides of the story, I believe the changes that Frey made were minute and insignificant. The story is still real, believable, and it sells."
5,"Fact or fiction, who cares! It's a good read!!","I don't care what any body says, whether fact or fiction James Frey wrote a powerful gut wrenching book. It grabbed me from the first page and kept me on edge until the end. Read his second book, ""My Friend Leonard"", you'll be weeping and cheering at the end!"
1,"I want my Money Back, James",Can someone please help me out with the address I should send this book back to for a refund?I'm a drug addict. I'm a liar. I'm a criminal. I'm a liar. I'm an alcoholic. I'm a liar.I'm a liar.I'm a liar.I'm a liar.
1,Huh?,"Three things amaze me about this book:1. That Frey thought anyone would believe this embarrasingly awful macho fantasy story.2. That the publisher it was submitted to didn't spray coffee over every page as he/she burst into mocking contemptuous laughter when Frey describes facing down various Mafia Dons, storming crack-houses to rescue distressed damsels and beating a man to death for touching his thigh.3. That there are, apparently, millions of witless chumps out there who find Freys memoir remotely plausible, and even inspiring.This isn't quite the worst book I've ever read - its certainly in the bottom five - but nothing has filled me with despair at the poor taste and gullibilty of the general public quite like the success of this extremely silly and mediocre book."
1,"How come I can't vote ""No Stars.""","I don't believe a word of it.Leaving aside the fact that this book is over 400 pages of two-dimensional characters spouting trite dialogue in contrived settings, there are too many factual inconsistencies to find this book credible.Maybe this guy did go to Hazeldon, maybe he didn't. But this book is fiction. That would be fine if it were well-written, but that's the worst of it - even if every single thing reported in these pages actually did happen, it's so badly written that I hope it's not true because it would be an insult to the people involved.I have read a number of memoirs which document battling addiction. This one...I think it's a scam to make money and not in any way an honest document. I want my money back and the 5 hours of my life I spent reading it. (Yes, I finished it because I didn't think I had a right to comment without giving it a full read.)"
1,Frey has killed a lot of people,"Who cares that its all a lie? I'm a recovering addict. A REAL addict, not a spoiled privileged midwest frat boy with a penchant for lying.I've been to four funerals in the last 12 months. One of them was a guy who dropped out of AA/NA after reading Frey's crap - before it had been exposed as a fraud.He decided to follow Frey's advice - beliving that Frey was ""one of us"" - a hardcore addict who had beat addiction without NA.He lasted about three months boefre he got high again. He was dead 2 months after that.Maybe it's ""who cares"" to non-addicts, but to us, to see someone claim to be one of us and to advise people to ""just hang on"" and ""you don't need the program"", then to find out his is full of it & is actually a spoiled little pampered pseudo-addict who has NO BUSINESS advising any real addict......Frey has killed a lot of people with his lies. He should be sued for wrongful death and consumer fraud. No, - he should hang."
3,20-20 Vision,"I had this book in my hand, wandering around Border's, thendecided that reading a ""train wreck"" was not worth getting aheadache over. The print was unusually tiny... just didn'tseem worth it."
4,not the truth but thruth in his story,"I waited until finish the book to read the expose on thesmokinggun.com, and to see oprah, and to listen to the gossip. At the start of the book, ever so graphic , on the plane, a hole in his cheer and bleeding, I began to wonder how he could remember this is his 'state' was so altered and injured. I wondered this again during the dental surgery.I thoroughly enjoyed the book but I did know he attended the snot bag Hazelden rehab for frat-boys-turned-drunks. I also know that 99% of rehabs have ""checks"" every 15 min, in which each patient must be accounted for since they are liable. Knowing this; I wonder how James could take off with Lilly for such seemingly long amounts of time. I also wondered about the open campus rule.Over all the book was a quick read and I was definately riveted. Upon seeing him read passages on Oprah under the ruse it was real, it kinda turned me off. A book wrapped in scandle with many good point but you must use a questioning eye."
3,Readers deserve truth in non-fiction novels,"Frey has done the reading world a diservice by selling a ""non-fiction"" book that includes a lot of fiction. There is no doubt that ""Million Little Pieces"" is a fascinating read following the life of an angry, confused, and addicted young man. Still, readers need to be warned that parts of this book consist of fictional writing. Even in the opening chapter you will likely wonder as I did what U.S. airline would have allowed Frey on a flight in the condition he claimed to be in (was this opening chapter all fiction?). We must demand and expect TRUTH in non-fiction books. Frey and his publisher do not deserve any more of our hard-earned money. If you must read Million Little Pieces read it knowing that some parts are completely ""non-fiction"" and borrow it from a friend or from the library."
5,Books are entertainment,"This is a great book and an excellent piece of storytelling. It does not claim to be a self-help guide. It is one person's story. The idea that it is supposed to be a memoir makes it even more entertaining. I don't expect every word of it to be true and neither should anyone else.Read the book and judge it for yourself as a piece of entertainment. Each individual can decide whether or not to believe everything he or she reads (or in this case everything Oprah recommends).This whole idea of adding a disclaimer to the book is ridiculous. So, every book should now say ""WARNING: SOME OF THIS MAY BE MADE UP SO IT SOUNDS BETTER""??I have a better warning:WARNING: BELIEVE EVERYTHING AT YOUR OWN RISKWhy are people so shocked that some things that were supposed to be true were made up? What about every book about Nostradamus? Fad diet books? Alien abduction? They all claim to be true and there is no need for a disclaimer there.Two words for everyone: Critical Thinking."
3,"what is the big deal, about altering a few things in a memoir","doesn't the world have anything better to do than to scrutinizea few inconsequential facts that the author misrepresented inthe book? I think that all this hype is petty..so what? Ina memoir things will be altered or changed, unless you wantto open yourself up for a law suit...this isn't a historybook..it is the story about someones life experience..noteverything is going to be told exactly as happened...is itever in life? Do you really believe that every memoir that hasever been written has been 100% accurate? If you do, thenyou are deluded. so why persecute this author? Why not digup the dirt on all the other authors that have written memoirs?"
1,Decadence,"This book is such testimonial bout his author; no truth but a pack of lies.A pathetic teenager brat, who turned into a pathetic Criminal adult, who turned into a con artist! No integrity, no personal honor, no character.A man who is so self absorbed and happy with himself that he only cares about himself.This fabricated book is not worth to be called a memoire and the publisher should know better."
2,My opinion after all of this...,"I read this book...before it was even an Oprah pick. I thought it was pretty interesting, kind of drawn out, the writing style though original became extremely tedious and annoying.The one thing so upsetting about the contraversy surrounding his book, is that if you are the kind of person who is inspired by other people's true life journeys, which I am, it is extremely disappointing to find out that the journey was not really as it was portrayed. The trust is lost.I really hope James doesn't decide to write ANOTHER memoir about the experience he has had being caught as a liar. He has no ethical standards, duped us all, and does not deserve to be selling anymore of these books, especially in light of the fact that he is an admitted liar."
1,A lie,"Frey was urged by his agent from novel to non-fiction because he couldn't sell it as a work of fiction. Then it sold. Bam!So basically people are reading a fiction labeled as non-fiction, and this idiotic shadow play passes for okay. And of course Oprah (who's morally fallen flat on her face) has to enable this liar because his book ""resonated"" with her, never mind that the book wasn't at all true and therefore the resonance has to be false.How Alice and Wonderland-ish America has become, when fiction must be dressed up as fiction to sell. If only truth had been allowed to prevail this mess would never have occurred.Ah well, welcome to the sinking ship that is modern America. Ancient Rome in its final death throes had nothing on us!"
2,Don't judge this book by its cover,"The book's opening snagged me. From there it all went disappointingly down-hill. For me, there's very little new here. Frey's stream-of-conscious, run-on sentences made the physical act of reading the book very difficult. I found myself tripping up and having to re-read passages. I also had to read this book in small intervals. Frey as the main character is extremely angry, bitter, stubborn and hateful, it's hard to want to spend much time with him or any of the other people in this book. The overwhelming negativity throughout actually forced me to take twice as long to read. I would have stopped reading if I wasn't such a completist. However, kudos to one of the coolest book covers in a long time. It's quite fetching!"
3,In case you cared......,"Not that this book needs another's opinion, but for good Christ, people, lighten up! Who cares whether or not certain parts of it are embelished --- did you LIKE the book or not? Frey is not someone so special that the whole of the country should be discussing his life. Take the book for what it is and go on with your life. Unfortunately, the world we live in with Amazon and other online reviews readily available, books are hardly sacred anymore because too many people who have no right to have a say on things all of a sudden have found a forum to make themselves feel important; things in the book world were much better and much more authentic before online reviews were available."
1,Pieces of bologna,"C'mon - the mobster with a heart of gold? Federal Judge and mobster bonding? Even if you believe the wannabe-tough-guy author can beat addiction through sheer strength of will, you shouldn't be fooled by this fiction. No airline would let this kid fly while covered in blood and vomit. No dentist would operate without anesthesia, no rehab councilor would take a patient to a crackhouse to rescue another patient. Oprah is a naive fool, as is anyone that believes this stuff."
1,Recovery?,"Aside from being a blatant liar, James Frey has done an enormous diservice to himself and the millions of us who are in recovery. His mockery of the humility and soul searching taught at places like Hazelton doom him to reside in the bardo of dry drunkeness and its consequent misery. It is not the sellers of this misleading book who should reimburse us readers but rather James Frey himself. And then, if he's serious about being a sane and healthy person on this planet, he should consider checking himself in again."
1,"self-promoting, selfish memoir- read SHANTARAM instead.","There are a million recovered addicts out there with more courage heart and compassion than Frey. Why Oprah would choose this guy to promote breaks my heart.There are better memoirs. Read SHANTARAM instead. It is more interesting, more original, more refreshing, and the author has learned from from his life than the spoiled rich kid Frey.Frey is SO impressed with himself by the end of the book I wanted to scream. Such ego."
1,The worst book I ever read,"I had high hopes for this book and found that I couldn't even read through 50 pages of it. It's written poorly, there's really no story, just thoughts. What a waste of money."
3,RUINED,THIS BOOK WAS ONE OF MY TOP 5 FAVORITES OF ALL TIME UNTIL IT WAS DISCOVERED TO BE MOSTLY FABRICATED.IT RUINS IT TO KNOW THAT IT'S NOT REAL.THE INTENSE STORIES KEPT ME ON THE EDGE OF MY SEAT WHEN I THOUGHT I WAS ACTUALLY READING A MEMOIR. NOW THEY ARE JUST THAT: STORIES.
3,Engaging in spite of it repetitiveness,"Had this book been 200 pages and cut the repetitive descriptions of the clinic (which, perhaps, seek to establish the monotony of his environment), ""A Million Little Pieces"" would have been a 5-star book. Within it is a frightening look at a self-loathing but determined recovering addict to prove that he can take responsibility for getting and staying sober. His relationship with Leonard and Lilly kept me from putting the book down and forgetting about it, as did his exploration (in the clinic) of what created his addiction and ""the Fury."" You will likely get restless at parts and be completely engaged at others."
3,Oprah knows a good book,I enjoyed this book very much. It is written in the first person without parenthesies which makes it very interesting and quick to read.
1,***A MILLION LITTLE LIES***,"This is the book that made Oprah sob her hypercommercialized sentimental eyes out?Who can't smell cheap sensationalist fiction out of this fabricated autobiography? ....Oh yeah, DIM-WITTED Oprah BOOK-CLUBBERs can't!If you read because Oprah is reading it, (I'm sorry, but I'm just being honest) your most likely an overly impressionable moron who can never stray out of the pseudo-literate herd without a big TV Woman's consent.Bottom Line: There are too many other and far greater books out there....and just because they are not touted by mainstream soap sellers doesn't mean that they should be devoid of reading....though it might mean that they are devoid of the same ol' recycled soap opera, soap Oprah, hackneyed melodramatics."
1,Complete fiction,"This book seems like complete fiction -and bad fiction at that. I'm stunned that Oprah's group didn't do any research - no airline would let this guy on the plane covered in vomit and blood. No rehab facility would let meals be catered, patients gamble to televised football games nor, especially, let one of the patients lead a counselor into a crackhouse in search of a patient that left the facility. James Frey is a failed screenwriter that came up with his best dose of fiction and a lot of desperate people bought it. Funny how the ""people"" or should I say ""characters"" that could have exposed him are all dead. I doubt that any really existed, particulary ""Leonard"" the mobster who says the author is the toughest kid he'd ever met. Pure, awful, dangerous fiction."
1,He had me going for a while,"Then I felt like a player in a poker game with a mirror behind my back. The book is in no way a memoir, the lies become so obvious after a while that it's insulting to the reader. His style is intriguing at first, then it becomes tiresome and tedious. The glowing reviews astound me. The positive side is that I see now that anyone can write a book. Now if I could only get on Oprah's book list. And maybe we need a treatment program for Oprah addicts. Cheap pulp fiction at it's best."
1,really should have seen this coming,"I read most of this book and was skeptical even before the hoopla broke out. Afterward, it seemed so obvious.The plane trip... ummmm, they wouldn't allow that, would they??The dental work.... hmmmm, that either...The gal who died tragically & everyone blames James ...gee, this rings a little falseLeonard the mob boss ... yeah right....But still, I really thought there might be a:Lily... oh come ON!!! You killed her off!?! oh please!Sorry, I actually enjoyed reading much of this book, but am left thinking it isn't just part fiction, but more fiction than non"
2,I Don't Get It.,"Hmmm. Frey is kind of a fake I guess. I'm not surprised but I guess what surprises me more is the way the media has fallen all over themselves to ride the Frey Express. How hard is it to write a book like this? I guess it's easy to judge but I really thought it stunk. There's a million little stories like this on every sad street in America but we somehow glorify this self promoter who gets off on telling us how BAD he is. Pathetic, yes. A con man? No Doubt! He's put one over on the whole world, not just his identity but his ability to make people think that this piece of literary garbage is somehow great writing."
1,Tedious,"Drink and drugs make most people boring, and this is no exception. The book is the narcissistic rant of an egomaniac who seems to think it's entirely all right to misbehave.North American society has created a wretched culture of celebrity that has deemed Frey's behaviour acceptable and something to be admired, rather than calling him to task and ensuring that he and only he takes responsibility for what he's done.It's not even a polemic or cutting-edge, since so many others have lined up to tell their stories. It's not big and it's not clever, it's just dull. Frey is not a superior person, he's just a person who thinks he is."
1,"""Lying became part of my life. I lied if I needed to lie to get something or get out of something.""... James Frey","Anyone considering reading this book should first read the investigative report, ""A Million Little Lies, Exposing James Frey's Fiction Addiction"", at The Smoking Gun website.James Frey lied with his claim that this book is the true story of his battle with addiction. He lied in order to get this book published. Now he is lying in an attempt to minimize the inevitable ridicule and bad press that the uncovering of his previous lies have caused him. Lies, lies, and more lies. When James Frey needs something, he lies, and when he needs to get out of something, he lies. Oh what a tangled web we weave..."
5,get over it people,"For those of you who are disappointed, or upset about the controversial news about this book need to get over it. This book was great. Fake, real or otherwise I enjoyed it and everyone else that I know did too. You go James Frey. WRITE ON!!!!"
3,Flawed but compelling,"My reaction to this book is mixed. On the one hand, I will freely admit that while I was reading it, I couldn't put it down and when I wasn't reading it, I thought a lot about it. The story is certainly a compelling one. On the other hand, I was struck by how self-indulgent, and in some ways, self-congratulatory, it was. While the author honestly portrayed the sordid and criminal nature of his pre-rehab life, he also paints himself as this strong, fiercely independent hero who manages to kick addiction, and save the life of another addict, on sheer will alone. He's certainly inviting you to admire him while at the same time, insisting that he is despicable. As for the ""style"" of random capitalization, minimal punctuation and odd paragraphs, I found it to be more gimmicky than anything else, as if Frey is trying too hard to eschew convention. But I wasn't distracted by it after a few chapters."
5,Edge of the chair,"A Million Little Pieces keeps you on the edge of your chair throughout most of the book, it is hard to put down and an excellent read. It ranks up there with the likes of Nightmares Echo (sad and courageous writing),Beauty For Ashes (written from a christian perspective) and Fractured Life (the hollywood tell it like it is).This is amazingly well done and highly recommended."
4,A Million Little Pieces,"Have only just started the read, but my daughters have read the book already. It is said to be excellent."
4,great book,"This is a memoir that is ""inspired"" or ""loosley based"" on an addicts life. Despite the fiction; it is truly an excellent read. The insight of an addict's mind, and the recovery process in well written."
3,A million little lies,"A Million Little Pieces is a good book to reed. But the writer dident mention it was fiction untill later making himself look like a hero. That is not nice to the readers but anyway its a good book fillid whith drugs, sex, love, and rootcanals."
1,People! Stop Buying This Book!!!,"This guy may have a very creative mind and he mey be a great writer and that is why he should have stuck with fiction! Stop giving him and his publishers money! He lied, plain and simple! Don't give him any credit he doesn't deserve! He is becoming rich off a lie! Stop buying his book!"
2,over rated,"Starts off okay, but as you continue to read this book, it keeps repeating itself. Anyone who has had drug problems would not want to read this book as it is very depressing and shows no hope. Most of the people in the book ends up dying except for the author who makes money off it. Also can't believe most of the book because if you broke as many rules as this person, they would have thrown you out of re-hap. Would not reconmend this book to anyone."
1,Overhyped fiction,I was interested in this book because it was on the Oprah Book Club list - then while it was being delivered - the Smoking Gun.com article came out which I read in it's entirety. The smoking gun article held my interest far greater then the Million Little Pieces Book. I have yet to get past the second chapter. It is a very dull read once you know that it is fiction!!!!!
2,I kept falling asleep...,"I just can't figure out what the appeal is with this book. I've talked to and read reviews from so many people who ""just couldn't put it down."" It literally fell out of my hands every night as I fell asleep reading it. I guess something about it reaches many - as indicated by the majority rave reviews. I was just expecting something more compelling."
1,Million Little Refunds,I read today where the publisher is offering refunds to who all bought this book and feel scammed becuase the author ( as we know find out ) lied. I took mine back today
4,"Most realitstic, non-glorifying account of addiction I've ever read","Addiction/recovery books generally fall into two categories: an author glorifying their own experience, or an author who has never had this experience simplifying and demonizing the addiction. Frey does neither. Although I am not an alcoholic or drug addict, this is the first book on the subject that has ever rang true for me. It criticises mainstream depictions of addiction and is, like Requiem for a Dream, one of the best tools to prevent people of any age from abusing dangerous drugs."
1,He is dispicable!,"I'm reading this book for my book group right now--I didn't vote for it. Right from page one it is such obvious fiction. And not even good fiction. No one would be allowed to board a plane covered in every bodily fluid and a literal hole in their cheek. I'm pretty clear on what happened here. The book was shopped around as fiction (to 17 publishers), but no one was interested because it just isn't that compelling to read about a character someone made up who has survived such horrendous obstacles. Now---make that person real and whoa!---you've got a story. I believe Frey was an addict and that he did go thru rehab---that part is proven. However, I also believe that he had a perfectly mundane addiction/rehab experience that he embellished from stealing parts of other people's lives. I'm just sickened that he lied about his involvement in the true story of a classmate's accidental death for his own gain. That poor family. I hope they sue him."
3,A compelling piece of fiction,"Amazing how everything just fell together for this Drug Addict Alcoholic Criminal! Anyone who's been in rehab will know most of this book is fiction...it just doesn't work that way, Mr. Frey. A counselor driving a patient to a crackhouse to find a runaway patient. Wanna buy a bridge?"
2,I can't imagine his behaviour tolerated in a treatment center,"I kept thinking that a treatment center, and esp. one with the reputation of Hazelden, would never have allowed James to repeatedly carry on in his disruptive way. Many go into treatment centers with little or no life discipline and order; whether we ""got"" it, or were willing to work at ""getting it"" the first time or not, hopefully we eventually achieve sobriety by some means, if not a 12 step program, then some kind of constructive plan of sane and peaceful living. I had a problem with the way the book seems to belittle any kind of disciplined treament, the way James' hero worship of the mobster was glorified, and the general repetition. There are many clues that James is not done abusing chemicals; I hope others that find themselves in his place don't refuse treatment based on his story."
2,Got punctuation?,"This was a very tedious book to read--tiny print, repetitous phrases and virtually no punctuation. The relationships Mr. Frey made in rehab were interesting (especially Leonard), but the idea that his raging addictions could be ""cured"" by a mind over matter attitude left me shrugging my shoulders."
1,A million little lies,"stretching the truth? Not even Elastic man or Plastic man could survive the so called ""truth"" that is stretched here. To stretch the truth one must first have facts to manipulate in the first place. In the case of James Frey (no relation to that woman who was sleeping around with the Peterson guy who was convicted of murdering his wife in California) it is nothing more than a made of story, a fanstay if you will. If you want fantasy read Piers Anthony, but if you want something in a modern day setting that is total fiction then just read this. Why anyone cares about somebody who destroys their life and others and then asks for sympathy and makes money on it is beyond me, totally beyond me. James Frey fooled a lot of people, including Oprah."
2,Oprah's an idiot,All the hype (both good and bad). All the talk. All the press and all you get in the end is: Meh.
3,worth a read,"generally I love Oprah -- but I think for myself. And I generally love peeks into how others live. This book lets you do that.Admittedly, I skimmed through the dental procedure. it was too much to imagine -- real or not.I suppose we would all have our own very interpretive account of this life -- if it were our own. My guess is that it's gut-wrenching and sometimes mind-numbing to go through this type of 'clean up.'But, it's a good story, and pretty addictive. Of course, I loved Eggers' book too -- and this is a lot like it.Everyone, incluing the author, was a bit of a caricature of themselves...but so much of everyday life IS truly mundane and Frey did a good job of including only what I needed to know to move the story forward.If you can look inside this life wihtout judgment it's a great read!"
2,CAUTION!!!,"A loved one, on his way to recovery, read this book, stopped going to AA, and started drinking again. Frey's book denounces AA, and maybe my loved one is just impressionable, but he started to think that going to meetings wasn't such a good idea anymore. Frey's way worked for him, but it doesn't work for everyone. Just a note of caution b/f you give this book to an alcoholic loved one."
1,Frey makes big bucks off sh*tty writing.,"James Frey swindled the gullible into thinking this garbage piece fiction is truth. Truth or fiction the writing is awful, and this man is only gaining wealth through the swine of oprah's book club. This makes me sick, please ignore him so maybe he will finally disappear. Well opinions are like A-holes, everyone's got one. Why am I even wasting time writing this....?"
5,"Didn't care about hype or ""truth""","I read this book before the controversy surrounding it...I picked it up because the title caught my eye. And now in light of recent events I couldn't care less if he really went through everything in the book. Whether its fiction or non, I could care less. I loved the book. I read it as someone telling a story and it didn't matter to me if the person telling it was real or not. *shrug*"
1,A Million Million Million Little,"After reading two biographies back-to-back, I decided to read some quick, cheap, pulpy fiction. I chose A Million Little Pieces. I can't believe anyone bought this as a memoir! From the first page, it reads like a treatment for a pretentiously gritty screenplay designed as a breakout, ""serious acting"" vehicle for some comedic actor (Tim Allen, Jim Carrey, Jimmy Fallon, etc).I started to wonder, perhaps James Frey never even went to rehab...? From someone who knows a thing or two about rehab, it certainly doesn't sound authentic. And the writing the writing the writing...Oh my God! So repetitious and oh so juvenile. Arctic Blue - locked and loaded - wanting wanting wanting - Why was everything in threes? I cringe everytime I think about this book."
4,If Oprah says so...,"Hey, Oprah says it is still a good book, so isn't that enough. Sure it is sold as non-fiction, which means it is true. And sure it is proven that he made up stories, even put himself in the center of a story involving the tragic loss of a real person. But why should that matter? The guy has to make some money selling books, and if he didn't embellish the truth would it have sold?Listen to Oprah folks, she knows books."
3,Not Surprised,"I'm honestly not surprised by this outcome. Its sad that he felt the need to ""embellish"" to the extent of complete fabrication. It was originally written as a work of fiction and one cannot help but wonder, how much of that remains as such. Its also too bad he felt the need to use a the death of a ""friend"" for dramatic effect. For those of you who deem his misdeeds as minor or irrelevant to the overall point of his story (supposedly recovery) OPRAH...I say lie in what is small, lie likewise in big. He flat out and repeatedly attempts to portray himself as ""a criminal"" which is a large portion of the overall tone of the book. Subjective memory. It was a good read, however I will not be spending my money on any of his future books, should there be any."
1,IT DOES MATTER,"Most of the glowing reviews state the power of the author's honesty in telling all the nasty secrets of his past. Oprah herself SOLD the book on her show by saying she had to meet the man who lived through this extraordinary nightmare. She ranted over and over about his criminal past - being wanted in 3 states. The guy made the whole thing up! Injecting himself into a real tragedy just for the sympathy is not only dishonest, it is sick! And now we are to believe that he just fabricated a few things to grab an audience. His mother stated on Larry King Live that she didn't even know he was drinking and doing drugs. Nothing he has to say can be believed.Shame on you James. Shame on you Oprah."
2,"Unbelievable and bad, or unbelievably bad","I can't believe anyone ever believed this story could be true. The characters are unbelievable, two-dimensional, and unlikeable. The protagonist is sanctimonious and substance-less, nothing like any real addict I know. Emotional breakthroughs come as if a switch has been turned, and within minutes and with no real introspection. And the writing is repetitive, unoriginal, and annoying. Writing the same sentence over and over and then adding the f-word to the same sentence is something that a 15-year-old might do in a remedial creative writing class."
2,Oprah's book club failed me,"James Frey wrote a book lauded as a memoir, which turns out to be untrue.Similarly, this book was lauded as a good read.This as it turns out, is also untrue.The story of the journey through rehab is repetitious - but its worst offense is that the characters are unsympathetic.It's hard to feel sorry for them, despite their dire circumstances.Finally, this story depicts a series of dental appointments that require extensive surgery without local anesthesia.This is a ridiculous fabrication.Drug abuse is not a contraindication for local anesthesia."
4,I don't care what anyone else says,I was referred to this book by an old friend of mine who got into doing drugs until they finally overcame his life. I had just gone through a bad phase myself and was now cleaning up. He was not. He told me 2 things: 1. you need get your life together. and 2. if you want to understand how i feel and what my life is like read this book. And told me about James Frey and a million little pieces.The script is very monotone and dry and the writing is very different than anything else I have read. It was refreshing. Frey has a great way of explaining exactly what he was thinking.I don't care if people don't believe in what he says and all the controversy. I read it before that all went down and didn't pay any attention to it. When you get off drugs your memory isn't going to be perfect and you just relay it the best way you know how.
1,Read this before you buy the book,"Oprah was certainly taken in by the story. But one of several people who weren't conned by Frey is John Dolan, a writer for exile.ru, who immediately panned the book as the cliche-laden hackery that it is, and in a later article even showed that the work is outright plagiarism of a far superior book by the late, genuine junkie, Eddie Little - Another Day in Paradise."
1,Wretched stuff,"What a jerk!!! An obvious liar and braggard.He does a great disservice to people in recovery.At one point in the book he rails against a rock starwho exagerates his drug and alcohol abuse and says""The truth is all that matters. This is f***ing heresey.""At another point he is offended by someone's bragging and thinks, ""Bobby, like all Liars confronted, is instantly defensive and instantly mad.""The worst of his offenses is his appalling prosestyle. Puerile, repetitive, stupid, clumsy...He actually writes ""I turned and I walked away and my legs were shaking like jelly with each step down the stairs."" And this guy says he wants to be the greatest writer of his generation.Heaven help us!!!"
1,I felt cheated and lied to,"I began reading this text several months after Oprah had embraced it on her show, and was at first disgusted at the language and then at the graphic description of events that supposedly happened to the author. You need a strong stomach to read parts of this book! Then came the reveal that the author had embellished details of the text. I haven't opened the book since and probably won't again. I can overlook vulgar language in a text of this type, and even some of the disgustingly graphic details, but being lied to I cannot overlook.It should have been the job of the editor to verify the truth of the story being told before promoting and publishing it as non-fiction.Oprah was duped by this author -- and so were we, his readers. That, to me, is far more disgusting than vomit and snot crusted clothing."
1,Put in Fiction!!!!,Just bought the book because it was suppose to be real and now I have learned it is fiction. I will return this as there are many authors out there who write very good stories and dont get publicity but if you write a book of lies you become a millionaire. I guess thats why all the dishonest are at the top!
1,"30 percent truth, 70 percent fiction.","Oh, come on. I know that alcoholics and drug addicts are great con artists, but give the reader an inch of credit for being able to see through it all. There's no way, at all, most of the things he's decribing could ever happen in a well respected rehab center. Beat downs? Destroying furniture? It didn't happen. There's no way an airline would let him on a plane in his condition. That ALSO didn't happen. The dental work? Nope. Aside from the obvious fictional aspects, the writing is Annoying. What's with The randomly Capitalized letters? How many times did we really need to hear about the Green of his Eyes? And his Fury? Made me furious to read about.The author is/was a spoiled rich kid who took up drugs to get attention from his family or SOMEONE because even negative attention is attention. When it turned out they didn't really have time to give him what he wanted, he spiraled out of control.Save your money, unless you're looking to be Irritated Beyond Words."
2,Very disappointed in this book,"After seeing Oprah and her staff go on and on about this book. I had to see what the big hype was all about. I bought 3 books, one for myself and 2 as gifts..big mistake. He bucked the whole treatment process so why was he there or allowed to stay? I was hoping to find some secret in recovering from an addiction but was left feeling empty at the end since he recovered by just saying ""no"" to his addictions. I wish willpower was that strong in everyone, then there wouldn't be addictions. I am disappointed in Oprah for endosing a book by someone that does not believe in God. I am also disappointed in Oprah for saying it was a page turner and I don't understand why anyone would stay up at night to read it, I had to make myself finish it."
3,I must admit I was hooked on the first page.,"I must admit I was hooked on the first page. I enjoyed the writers style of writing, although the language is pretty harsh. I was disappointed when I finished the book and then heard all the news of actual events. However, while reading I did assume that incidents had been slightly exaggerated. Bottom line worth reading and there probably is something you will take from this book."
5,From the addict's mother,"I am blown away, on how much i can relate in this book to my own experience. My child is an addict fot he past 11 years. This is the only book, that i read, that resembles reality of an addict. I would recommend this book to every parent, who is strugling to understand every day is ""why"". I do not care about controversy, it is not significant in comparision with the rest of the content. I also heard from addicts, validating similarities with their lives.I am greatfull to have more understanding after reading this book."
1,What next?,"Mr. Frey writes ""I lied if I needed to lie to get something or get out of something.""Say it ain't so, BigJim.Mr. Frey also says (out loud, mind you) that he ""wants to be the greatest literary writer of his generation.""That ship sailed with that sentence. If he aspired to being the greatest NON-literary writer, maybe he'd have a shot."
1,Hey Amazon.com -- Stop deleting bad reviews,"Liar, mama's boy, bad writer. Publisher lied, author embellished, Oprah stood by an integrity violator. Three wrongs won't correct things."
1,what an idiot,"A note to anyone contemplating this read- don't bother!!Frey is unsympathetic, unlikable. Having traveled a similar road as the author, I fear the uninitiated reader will be left with the impression that Frey's mentality is indicative of ex-abusers in general. I do share Frey's weariness of coerced spirituality. Nevertheless, the reader should be aware that alcoholics and addicts come in all shapes, sizes and worldwiews. In this addicts humble estimation, most of us have outgrown the phony, adolescent bravado which he so boorishly demonstrates throughout the work. This guy sucks !!"
4,Drug use,"I think the book really shows the reality of drug use and what really happens when you abuse drugs.. Some parts were made you cringe and some parts made you feel really bad, but you gotta think that he put himself in that position. It is really sad that so many people turn to drugs and alcohol now days to get rid of there problems.. In reality it usually makes things worse for them...."
3,I felt I was in rehab with him..,"The book started strong, but as it went along, the same cuss word was used almost every sentence, and who proof read this book? Many words were capitalized in the middle of the sentence that should not have been. I like the interaction between James and Lilly. He had an over kill on his mother's crying, but did not tell enough about the blond girl he loved. The book ending was not what I thought it would be. I thought the AA concept would finally register. No man is an island, but he came close. The description of the dental work (with no pain medication) was exceptional. I do hope he realizes that there really is a God. How could he not after taking a trip to hell."
2,"Fiction, but captivating","I read the book way before the smoking gun came out with their report. Needless to say, I didn't really believe the majority of what Frey wrote. Now that we know that the majority of it is fiction, i would not recommend this book to anyone who has been in rehab or is dealing with a drug and/or alcohol problem. If you would like a beach bum read, or something to keep you occupied on a rainy day then MAYBE pick it up. Honestly, there are so many other better books out there.... don't waste your money."
2,Way over hyped!,"I was really expecting much more - it was one of those books that I couldn't wait to finish and started skimming through repetitious pages towards the end. I hated all the characters whether they were addicts or reformed addicts. Sorry, unless you like to read about gross and dispicable low lifes, pick another book."
1,Definitely not the best book,"I bought this book to read on a flight - and it was one of the longest flight's I've ever taken. The writing style was difficult to get used to, but I finally did. However, his recollections were not very believable, and come to find out - they were all lies. While I appreciate this is a good story (and I emphasize story, because it's all fiction) about addiction, it is dangerous to embrace lies as ""who cares because it's a good story about addiction."" It's as good a story about addiction as Bambi is a National Geographic special on deer - they're both made up and have no correlation to reality, and his story is made up - there's no reality about addiction in it. Therein lies the danger - that people will believe his story is true and act accordingly."
1,Very Immature and Ego Inflated,Mr. Frey writes a typical and trite addiction/recovery book. Unfortunately his immature view of his own strength and Chinese philosophy may lead some troubled person to try what has worked (so far) for Mr. Frey instead of the methodologies that actually help with addiction recovery. Mr. Frey will probably write some excellent books when he acquires more wisdom and maturity. This book may appeal to Oprah's audience but it does not strike me as an important work.
1,pieces of what?,"Since recovery is based on truth, please don't pick up this piece of crap and reccommend Frey's narcissistic rambling to someone with a drug problem. If someone wants to write seriously that takes honesty too, not to mention discipline, attention to detail, and a little humililty. It's a craft, not a freak show. If you buy that he did 10% of what he says he did, or that he is an ""author,"" well, I guess that's probably how we ended up in Iraq, and is a plausible reason that good portion of the country believed (and still do) that Saddam Hussein bombed the Twin Towers. Some of our citizenry are just as lazy as Frey is. We all love a good story."
1,Dishonest,It was a good book until the media coverage hit. A good way to make a buck until you get caught!
4,Even Though,"Even though the author may have embellished his recovery story, his unusual writing style was fresh, honest and illuminating in a new way.Anyone who thinks they understand or knows they don't understand addiction and the toll it takes on everyone involved will gain insight and hopefully compassion from A Million Little Pieces."
4,Doobie anyone?,"Ok, so I enjoyed it and I don't care what O said, but I did find parts repeating, repeating, repeating...do you think he was having flashback while writing?"
1,This book is NOT just an exaggeration. The entire thing is a LIE!!!!,"People who have reviewed that the poor guy was given a bad rap because he ""embellished"" have not read the facts.James Frey, himself, admits the entire book is a LIE. He made up time spent in re-hab, he made up going to prison, he made up killing an officer, he made up having a drug problem!!! He was a spoiled little rich kid who drank a few beers with his fraternity brothers.It DOES make a difference that this book is a lie. 99% of why this book is inspirational is because the reader assumes it is true! Over and over in the book, he says his life is dedicated to telling the truth. Meanwhile, Frey has admitted all of it was a lie. His message was if he can do it, so can you. But in fact he never did anything! It's as inspirational as Snow White!The man should be imprisoned!"
3,Not a page turner for me,"This was an interesting look into a life I might otherwise not be privi to. There were similarities to the various obsessive thoughts I might indulge from time to time...but this wasn't quite the page turner, it was claimed to be!"
3,if you've ever been there.........,"You'd never be let on an airplane in that condition. Bottom line. But it sucked you in didn't it? Me too. I dropped an awful drug habit over 5 years ago.Yes, it was painfully obvious that the book was embellished. But the underbelly of it all is painfully true. Kicking a habit is one of the hardest things to do--drugs, alcohol, all of it. Frey gives a good kick to the story that we've all heard a hundred times before. He does it well. He makes you feel how disgusting it all is. The writing style is unique and kept me reading 'til it was done. My underlying feeling that it was very much embellished kind of got to me, but how else can a loady convey a story about being a complete wasted wreck?Pick up a copy if you want something to read on the plane or in line at the bank, or just to pass some time."
1,Where is the zero when you need it?,"The worst part of this book is that it's written as if it's happening in real time. Were it a journal - something the author contributed to on a day to day basis - it would be more honest. But as it stands it's a memoir of sorts and seems romanticized.James really pitied himself for having to go through recovery. He wanted the reader to feel how perilous his life had become while using. He wanted the reader to care that he stayed clean because if he didn't he would die. He even went so far as to write an obituary, which is more like a resume on his drug career than what would actually be printed.Also, the menial style in which the story was written was abhorrent. Maybe the chronic repetition is symptomatic of a drug abuser but it was quite annoying.Congratulations, James, you are the first author I have quit reading because I don't care to know how your story ends."
2,Missing CDs,I think it arrived 2 CDs short. I never told anyone or gave them a chance to make me happy. It was disappointing but I have other stuff to listen to.
1,What about LILLY?,"As a recovering addict, I knew there would be tragedy at the end of this book. Maybe the James Frey Program worked for James but it didn't work for Lilly and probably won't work for the majority of addicts. What if ""The Rules"" and the 12 steps had worked for Lilly? I believe that his helping her to rebel against ""The Program"" and ""The Rules"" was completely, utterly selfish and irresponsible. The steps that he disdains might have given her tools to deal with her Grandmother's death. I am not impressed with this book at all. I hope James Frey feels some responsibility for Lilly's death. So sad."
1,rich kid does bad,"Indulgent, uninspired but unflinching rant about addiction. Jack London, Burroughs, Bukowski all covered this territory with greater technique and genuine fever."
1,Depressing and predictable,"Ouch. What a depressing read. It's OK but totally predictable and it comes off as phony and made up, which is strange for a book that purports to be so real. Also, this book aside, I think a more interesting tale would be an analysis of why Oprah consistently picks such negative, depressing books. She sees herself as the queen of positive thinking, but she urges readers to wallow around in negative novels. I don't get it. I wish she'd recommend something uplifting for a change."
3,Funny,"So I needed something to read and I was at my mom's house and I saw this laying around -- I decided to check it out.It was a good laugh!From the first page, did nobody consider that there's no way an airline would let a guy fly in that condition? Bleeding, covered with puke, beaten to a pulp, missing teeth?So it gets off to a start that anybody with any real-world experience would never believe, and then just gets more and more fanciful as it continues...Laughs on nearly every page, from the twisted punctuation and grammar to the man-hugging and blatant tear-jerking and single-word paragraphs."
4,"Despite the drama behind the book, I enjoyed it!","A lot of readers do not like or recommend this book due to the drama behind the story, but it's a good story. Sure, the story isn't based off of his life as he once said, but it still gives you the raw, emotional feel of being a recovering addict in rehab. I've read this book many times and still enjoy it each time."
1,OPRAH needs to come clean,"After reading the section on ""The Smoking Gun"", I am amazed that OPRAH has not come forward to disavow and revoke this book as one of her selections and its author (after all she had a show dedicated to this ""Alleged"" con man).Book is in fact, apparently, ""A Million Little Lies"""
3,Hard to Rate,"I was about midway in the book when the controversy broke. I had told many people that it was one of the best and most fascinating book I had ever read. When Oprah revealed that it was fiction, I tried to read on but could not. Even at the very beginning when Frey told about his root canals and the capping of his teeth, I thought ""how could anyone survive that?"" I plan to go back and finish the book some day, but it will be with a different attitude. This time I will be reading it as fiction loosely based on facts. I am very disappointed in the writer. He is a very talented author but has ruined his opportunity to be remembered as one of the great writers of our time. Instead,he will be remembered as a liar and a deceiving inddividual."
3,Verbose and tiresome,"A frustrating but insightful read. Rather verbose and repetitive. A good ""Skim"" read by the end."
3,Fiction,"I read this book and ""My Friend Leonard"" before the media storm hit James Frey. I will admit that I enjoyed both of them, though I did think that this was one lucky guy to have met certain people who helped him out along the way to recovery. Now we know why he was so ""lucky"". It wasnt the truth. Good read, but was much better when the reader thinks its true, not fiction."
3,Too much hype,"I was really looking forward to reading this book after all the ""buzz"" that was out there on it. I do admire James for his comitment to get clean and stay that way for 13 years. The book itself was just not a great read for me. I think if you have not gone through something like this it is hard for you to relate to it thus it was a slow read for me presonally. I would still recomened it to anyone suffering from addiction issues though."
5,The Truth Hurts,"We talk of the ""hard"" truth, never the ""easy"" truthand that truth ""hurts."" In this book it is and it does.As a therapist, who has tried to help addictive men and womenfor over forty years, I know the truth of which James Freywrites. He has lived it and now he is telling it. Envy the style,complain about the form, misunderstand the message, but DO NOTquestion the validity or insult the purpose. The book has theparadox of hope and helplessness, help and hopelessness, despair and faith, as life itself."
1,Another Oprah Directed Best Seller,"I find it an insult to the American literary community that as soon as the big ""O"" attaches her seal of approval to a work it instantly soars to the top of everyone's bestseller list. Are we that lost that we wait until a talk show host informs us what is quality literature? Please tell me it isn't so!! Let us all be a reading Rosa Parks and ""sit"" at home and not ""stand up"" to flock to the end of the Literary Lemmings Line."
2,"Yes, he lied...","I, too, feel ""duped"" by James. I read the book before Oprah put her brand on it, and I was blown away. I was also shocked when she picked it, as it doesn't quite fit with her usual selections.I love that he had the guts to own up to his mistake, but he still came out ahead. He made a ton of money on his fabrications. Sadly, this will only cause people to buy his book more to determine was was truth and what was fiction. Save your money!"
1,"A Million little lies, or omissions","There's a big difference in puffing up a story and flat out lying about it. This book is about his personal recovery. But then again it's not his story is it? It's a mythical character that he created to sell books. It's a mythical character with mythical adventures. If the book had been listed as fiction I wouldn't have a problem with it. But lies are lies no matter how much color they add to the story. Oprah is dead wrong to say the lies are much ado about nothing. I guess any whacko can lie about their history, road to recovery and because it helps the story sell it's alright. Two Thumbs way down!!"
1,I need a long shower. I feel dirty after reading this book,"I read this knowing full well it was fiction, after the furor. The plot is sophmoric. Everything tied up so neatly. Tiresome language. And the treatment of the female lead is a deplorable exploitation. It's hard to exploit someone who is not real but that might be Frey's singular talent. Dreck"
1,Fraud,"Everything about this book is a lie and it's very dangerous to say to addicts that AA and NA are hogwash and one should just quit and follow the James Frey pathway to sobriety.If it was that easy, no one would be smoking cigarettes Frey, like you do.The topic he addresses is deadly serious.l The advice he gives is by a lying deceitful quack, himself.So, should you believe anything he says to be truthful or helpful?absolutley not."
1,Nice piece of fiction-- total fabrication,"I read this book in about a day after hearing about him on Oprah. The first couple of pages brought serious doubts to mind about the authenticity of his ""story"".I have since learned that Mr. Frey fabricated a majority of the things that happened to him and attempted to sell this book 17 times as a work of fiction not non-ficiton.I feel duped because as a consumer I thought I was reading a true story.Would not recommend this book to anyone."
2,Hmmm,"This is a good read for sure, but the problem I have with this book is Mr. Frey has no problem discounting a higher power/God, etc. and is willing to throw the Bible in the trash with used Q-Tips and used tissues, but he is eager and willing to take advice from Leonard - a cold-blooded, vengful killer, as well as adopt Leonard's catch phrase, ""Just Hold On"". Good advise for sure - I even saw a young man on the Oprah show tattoo this phrase on his arm. Good advise or not, the fact that this is where his inspiration is found says a lot about the author. I wish him well and I hope he continues his life of sobriety and continues to help others...whatever works I guess?"
1,"no great writer, not worth the hype","i picked up this book (at the library, fortunately) to see what all the hype is about. btw, note that had this guy not been backed by oprah, not a word have been said. but i digress. i envy frey his lucrative writing career, but he is by no stretch of the imagination a great writer. it's pretty boring, actually. every day in rehab is the same. he eats, he talks with people, he argues with counselors about how he'll never get better, he berates himself for being a drug addict and criminal, he pines over a girl, he eats lunch and dinner, and then we repeat the cycle.and, pre-oprah hype, how could anyone not see the fake parts of this book? the scene in which he describes Leonard's father dying -- is so fakey and straight out of a Godfather or Goodfellas movie. uck.worth a peek if you're curious, but see if you can borrow your friend's copy. or hit the library."
2,Too Much Profanity,"I purchased this book over nine months ago before all the major controversy surrounding the author of this book. I thought this book was very interesting, but used a lot of profanity throughout the book. It was hard for me to imagine a person actually going through every event in this book. The book was ok for me, but I believe it would definitely touch a lot of lives."
5,Unbelievably Honest and Truely Rivoting,"""A Million Little Pieces,"" by James Frey is an intense and perfectly detailed account of a human quitting his drug and alcohol dependency. James Frey is horribly honest and funny in a young-guard Eggers and Wallace sort of way, but perhaps more contained and measured. He is unerring in his decent into a world where the characters need help in such extremely desperate ways. Read This Immediately."
4,Raw look at Addiction,"This is a terrific book, although brutal. It is a raw look at addiction that ranks among the most honest in the genre."
5,One Man's Reality cannot be non-fiction,"The hype surrounding this book is great- for the sole purpose that it has asisted Mr. Frey in selling an extraordinary amount of copies of his book.Many critics will argue that truths have been exaggerated- even fabricated- the point is his message. Drug addiction, rehab centres and jails are so far from pleasant. Simply writing methodically about it would seem dry and tedious to the reader. Frey's account accentuates the rawness of being human and brings home to the reader the horrors of a self destructive life.Many memoirs lack a natural talent for language but this one does not. Frey does not ever try to ascribe blame for his situation to anyone but himself. He is humble in himself and unaware of his own superior strength- which was also his biggest weakness.I recommend this book to all, and ask readers why they are so quick to criticise one man's acoount of an experience that only he lived?"
3,O.K at best,"After all the hype with this book I really expected it to be great. People I work with talked about it, friends talked about it and I just had to read it. It was ok. I really dont understand what the big deal is about it. Sure its a good book, worth reading, but its not the greatest book ever written like some say."
2,sad story pathetic writer,"This books starts out well, but very quickly even w/out smoking gun you begin to realize it's built on lies. I had a hard time finishing it. I just grew to not like this guy. unfortunatley I got talked into reading My Friend Leonard, and like him even less after that. This guy still needs help."
2,What a waste!,"I honestly don't understand what all the hoopla is about. This is a garden-variety rehab story. I guess those who are bowled over by it probably don't get out much: tons of people either know someone who went through rehab or experienced rehab themselves. In addition, Frey's self-conscious, repetitive, and pretentious writing style prevents any chance it might have of being considered great literary drama.James Frey is very luck Oprah jumped on his bandwagon. Otherwise, this book would be a prime candidate for the remander bins at one's favorite local or online bookstore."
5,Honesty,absolute honesty is found in this book...a book that people should read to be able to get a feel for the raw side of life and the daily ramifications of it.I want to also mention Nightmares Echo and Running with Scissors. Each book has its own words of honesty and many life lessons learned. Though these books are not for the faint of heart it will teach you about life and what really goes on within a persons soul
3,"Good read, but slightly disappointing based on reviews","I picked up this book because I saw my wife watching Oprah and everyone on the show was saying that it was an absolute must read, that they could not put the book down. Although I did find that the book was extremely ""real"", I did have a problem with the attitude of the author throughout the book. He comes across as very anti-authority, even when he is at death's door. That part of the book was hard for me to adjust to.Overall, I think the book is worth reading. It takes you into a world that few see and makes you aware of the desperate lives that addicts find themselves leading. It doesn't pull any punches. Don't look for a feel good story in this one."
3,Interesting book but a real disservice for anyone hoping for recovery,"I enjoyed reading this book and, in fact, found it hard to put down. However, once I found out about his embellishments it was a real turn-off. I also think that his way of ""testing"" his sobriety is to put a glass of whiskey ( or whatever it was) under his nose is ridiculous. It is a good read but I somehow have lost some respect for the author."
2,Interesting but thats about it.,"Ya this book is amusing, or should I say interesting, But honestly I didn`t believe have the stuff in it, just impossible, I have seen the worst of the worst in addictions, and this just didn`t sum up.If you want to read a book that is right on with addictions, read Lifes Trial written by Gina Henderson, its about a little girl that had to grow up with a parent on heroin, Its really Shocking, and believable."
3,Bleh,"One reviewer writes that Mr. Frey is a ""spoiled rich kid"" who lets Mommy and Daddy foot the bill for his rehab, and that is more true than most of what's in the book. I never felt sorry for Mr. Frey (except when he was ripping off his toenails, and that made me a little squeamish), and in fact was a little angry at his self-serving attitude. I felt like he portrayed himself as this hero figure who made such a positive impression on the poor down-trodden souls who happened to stumble into his ""light."" The only thing about Mr. Frey that impressed me was his unwillingness to assign blame to anyone but himself for his addiction, and for that I applaud him. I hope other people will read this ""dramatization"" and realize that the only real message lies in the fact that HE made himself an addict, that HE chose that lifestyle, and that only HE could make himself better. It's true for addicts of all kinds, including smokers, shoppers, and overeaters - the only one who can change one's life is self."
4,It was insightful,"I read this book right when Oprah introduced it a couple of years ago. I found it intriguing because coincidentally my older brother was entering a year long stint of drug rehab at the same time. It was insightful as a caring family member to be able to see inside of a former drug addicts mind. Even though we know he didn't tell the whole truth in parts of the book, I found it very insightful and it truly didn't matter to me whether all of it was the complete truth or not. It was a story that one person wrote that had some truth to it and that story helped me get through that hard part of my life with my brother. It made me be more empathetic towards him. So while he is getting a lot of critcism for the book and his truthfulness, I would still recommend this raw account of one person's struggle with addiction."
2,Why is he so angry?,"Worth reading so you can talk about the hype surrounding the book but not great literature by any stretch of the imagination.I came away just wanted to know why he is so pissed off at the world ... After all, if he is sober and happy now, why not blend some gratitude into the book, even just as a postscript?"
3,How Could Anyone Think This Book Was Nonfiction????,"From the first few pages I was sure that parts of this book are fiction; I thought this was obvious and enjoyed reading it regardless. Hello!!! What difference does it make??! Dentists don't just simply refuse to provide any form of anesthesia just because someone is addicted to a drug or alcohol. DUH!!! And if someone has blackouts all of the time due to their addictions, how would they remember everything in detail? None of us does, even without the blackouts, but who cares?! If a book is good reading, it's good reading. If the publisher told Frey to claim it's strictly non-fiction, I don't understand the point. From page one, I believed that this book is fiction based on a true story and accepted it as such. Why was this made out to be such a big deal when there are other more newsworthy items??!!"
2,shockingly boring,"I understand the desire to shock a reader to keep things interesting however, in this book Frey did not succeed. I first read this book as a senior in high school and was unimpressed. It's an easy read and is moderately interesting, enough to get through at least, but Frey's attempt at being brutal and honest comes off as unrealistic and cold. He as a main character, although fictional, is very hard to identify with let alone like. Overall I really didn't like this book because to be blunt, it sucked."
3,A Million Pieces of Kleenex,"A Million Little Pieces is a MUST READ for folks such as Oprah enthusiasts who live for gushy sob stories, rivers of gushing tears and endless gushy hugs. And it's a pretty good read even if it's more of a novel that memoir. Besides after a few chapters it's pretty obvious that it's liberally seasoned with baloney. I don't mind, most of the bible is fantasy too yet some folks think it has value. James Frey deserves some credit for spinning a pretty good yarn, more credit for managing to sell it but mostly he deserves a gushy group hug for fooling Oprah."
1,Read it as Fiction - still hated every page,"I read this book far after the hype that it wasn't entirely true, and it was embellished. Even after knowing that I found myself hating every page...in fact I found myself skipping up to 5 pages at a time just so I would be through with the book quicker. I felt like Frey was going for the heartstrings a little too much, which was hard to fall for after knowing most of it was a lie. I feel for those struggling with addictions and I hated that he capitalized on that. I also hated how he setup the dialogues, and just didn't like the writing style at all. Can't wait to trade it in at the local book swap."
5,Deeply personal book,"A Million Little Pieces is certainly one of the best books I've written in quite a long time. His writing style--lacking quotation marks, paragraph indentations, and most commas--does an excellent job of conveying a profound sense of desperation and near-defeat. For me, Frey's most impressive achievement is his ability to write about personal emotional exchanges in a very simply way without seeming cliched or overly sentimental. The only story in the book that seems a little unrealistic is his relationship with Lilly. Otherwise, this is a fantastic read."
2,NOT GREAT,"I HAVE TO BE HONEST THE FIRST FEW PAGES WERE INTERESTING , AFTER THAT IT JUST REPEATED ITSELF OVER AND OVER AGAIN . I WANTED TO SKIP TO THE LAST CHAPTER JUST TO FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED . WELL HE WROTE THE BOOK SO I DIDNT HAVE TO DO THAT .. NEVER FINISHED , NOT WORTH THE TIME AS FAR AS IM CONCERNED ."
3,Don't believe the hype!,"Yes it's a good story. Is it believable? The jury is still OUT! I try to read all Oprah book club suggestions. Some I made it through some I haven't. All the hpye Oprah and her staff have generated, as to how it keep them up all night, and how it is a page turner, about this book left me so unfulfilled. Yes, I wanted to know what eventually happened to James at the end. And yes, I WAS ABLE TO PUT IT DOWN (It actually took me 2 weeks to read this one). Good story, but Don't Believe the Hype!"
2,"Great Liar, Bad Writer",I wouldn't have much of a problem with this book if James Frey hadn't rediculously presented it as non-fiction. How stupid does he think the average consumer is?? The blatent and absurd lies and ego-stroking in this book are an insult to his readers' intelligence.
4,Honesty is what recovery is all about,"I truly enjoyed this book, it was great writing, incredibly descriptive, and very engaging. I respect Mr. Frey and feel somewhat bad for him now. I do not believe he realized the harm lies could actually do to people in the depths of addiction as well as those in recovery.I lived a life similar, give or take a few indulging scenes.Addiction is painful, destructive, and as insane as this book describes. However, recovery is indeed possible with individualized efective and competent treatment.Hopefully, Mr. Frey now realizes the importance of honesty and will continue on his spiritual path.I think enough is enough and we should practice forgiveness for this mistake.Recovery is a tough journey, lets not make it more difficult for James.Any comments or discussions please feel free to contcat me."
2,A Million Little Pieces,"I give the author credit for writing his experiences. But after reading half way through the book, I couldn't stand reading anymore about vomiting, etc. I found it depressing even though I am a nurse and know about such things. I'm glad I only paid 50 cents to get it from our library~~~"
5,wonderful read,I read this book a few months ago long before all this crap started coming out. The thing for me is that this book drew me in and I would only put it down when I had to do something else. It is amazing to me that people would be wasting so much time and energy on such a ridiculous matter. He wrote the book and described it as he remembers seeing it and that is all that matters.
4,good despite the media whoo-ahhh,"I was midway through this book when the media found out that there were ""embellishments"" by the author. I have to say that even though it wasn't 100% true, it is still a great book and my fastest read ever. The only problem with this book is that is should be in the ""based on a true story"" section rather than the ""memoir"" section. It is a gripping account of drug and alcohol rehab and I couldn't agree more with his thoughts of personal responsibility and choice."
5,Memoir or otherwise - great book!,"James Frey has taken a lot of heat recently over whether or not details in this book are true. Regardless, I think this was a fantastic book. It was interesting, thought provoking, intense, funny at times, and overall very entertaining. I have never suffered from an addition myself, but James' description of what it feels like to be overtaken by one seemed very real.I loved this book! (I loved its follow-up ""My Friend Leonard"" just as much too.)"
2,Pure Fiction,"I think that the book is pure fiction.I have worked as a therapist in a rehab and I know that the fantasy stuff that he is claiming happened would not have happened in a real rehab. There are so many people waiting in line to get a shot at being sober and ""humble"". He would have been out of the rehab so fast if he carried on the way that he claims!Frey is arrogant and self praising. I would rather like the book more if it was considered fiction."
1,Crummy fiction,"It would have been a compelling piece of non-fiction but as everyone knows there isn't much that is true in it. Even Oprah finally figured it out.Before I had completed it - it seemed a bit far-fetched. Mr Frey on the verge of death was able to intimidate mafia bosses and tough guys of all sorts. He was able with his iron will to rescue maidens from crack houses withstanding the temptations.So it wasn't a big suprise to read the online article that discovered that anything that could have been documented such as arrest records, didn't exist or the events were dramatically different from Mr. Frey's recollection.So I'm am unhappy to have added to Mr. Frey's wealth with my purchase."
5,Boo Oprah,"This is one of the best books I've read in a long time, and Oprah's endorsement had nothing to do with it. I will NEVER watch her show or support anything that egotistical women does after watching the public humiliation that Frey had to endure on her show. Thanks Frey, for the great book. I'm looking forward to reading ""My Friend Leonard""."
3,"Okay, James Frey has been exposed...but...","...having gone through addiction rehab myself, I can tell you that overall, this is a somewhat accurate description of the hell one goes through when trying to reclaim their life. Although, personally I recall more of a personal, in-the-hot-seat-and-in-your-face therapy, I was able to relate to some of the torment described in this book.A) Is it worth the read? mmm... now that we know what we know thank to Smokin' Gun, maybe not.B) Could it affect you if you suffer an addiction? Yes, very likely.C) Should we condemn James Frey? I'm not sure any of us can claim that power.D)Should we form an opinion? Of course. And we will."
1,misslead,"I was about 1/3 the way through the book & when I seen on TV how he had lied & twisted the truth I have not picked the book up again . My son is crack addicted & a drunk, I was really looking for some insight as to his life & maybe how I could help. I just feel if its all made up then why even finish reading the book. Really dissapointed!!!!Jerry Jean"
3,Are some of the facts altered?,"If anything this is a great story to share with youth to establish a fear of what addiction can be like. On the other hand some of the material seems, well, perhaps a bit stretched. This is an extremely expensive detox rehab center. Would they allow one of their clients to have two root canals without anesthesia? Seems somewhat barbaric!! In addition, the detective scene at the end of the novel where he is able to hunt down his girl friend in practically no time in a crack house?? I am sorry for being cynical, I am just trying to tell it like it is. Otherwise, the book is well written in a diary like format. It is a page turner and will be hard to put down once you are into the book."
5,A Million Little Pieces,"This book should be read by everyone. We all suffer from some sort of addiction and this book makes you look inside yourself in a very raw and honest way. Although I am not a substance abuse user it gave me a new perspective on drug and alcohol abuse.This book is brutally honest and vivid. James Frey puts you in the recovery process with him. At times I felt physical pain, at times I felt anger, at times I felt sadness, at times I thought I don't know if I could have been as brave as he was and is to this day.This is a must read book for anyone who knows someone with an addiction or who is an addict or a recovering addict themselves.The words are powerful, moving and in some ways almost unimaginable. I think all of us will come away a little better for having read this amazing story."
2,"How much is fact, and how much is fiction?","I had a hard time with this book. He goes to rehab and falls in love with a crack-addicted hooker with a heart of gold, and becomes like a son to a well-known and very connected mobster? Who then asks him to be his son? Are you sure this wasn't an episode of ""Touched By An Angel""?The writing style is really annoying. I tried to like it, and attempted to think from his point of view, but the author is so pompous. And listening to him repeatedly try to convince himself he was a badass quickly became old.From previous reviews I've read, some people obviously love this book. I don't get it."
3,I feel for him...,"Am I the only one that sort of feels sorry for Frey? I only got a 1/3 of the way through the book until I put it down for good. I didn't like it that much, however, I can see how other people could. I can understand the writer's impulse and compulsive need to get published. If you write books you want to get that stuff put out there and there will be plently of people (hello Doubleday) that will tempt you to compromise your integrity. I know that he lied, he has admitted as much, but I can sort of understand the desire to get the book published. I noticed back in September that he was extremely uncomfortable on Oprah when she was questioning him about his addiction and I remember his parents there- the absolute worst part of this whole ordeal is that he got his parents involved in this. I think that we can all learn something from his situation."
4,Trusting Oprah,"I never had any doubts when Oprah announced this as a book in her Book Club...I ran the next day to get it ....BUT it was not available in any Book Store in UAE...so, I kept hoping for 3 weeks..nothing!..till i saw Oprah interviewing the writer himself & her own Harpo Studio Staff..OH GOD ..I said to myself ""i should have this book NOW!!!"" So i bought it with one click from Amazon and i recieved it in 1 week & i read it in 3 days....It worth reading it ! My friends still trying to get a copy untill this minute. Thanx to Oprah for her wise choices & to amazon."
3,Poor Writing Skills,"I thought that this book was alright. Even though most people feel it is a work of fiction, it is still a good book. It tells a good story of overcoming ones demons and proving your self worth and overcoming addictions. I also thought that his writing style was very poor. At times, Frey didn't use correct punctuation and I never once saw a quotation mark. This made reading a little confusing, especially at times where there were long conversations. I also thought that the repetition of words was unneeded. I only need to read the word once and then I get it. I don't need it repeated for me. Overall, I give the book three stars."
1,Disappointed!,"I bought this book based on Oprah's recommendation. After I started reading it, I personally questioned the validity of this book. Then the news broke about the author and now I can't get back into reading it. It was a waste of my money."
2,OUCH!!!,All I can say is OUCH!! This thing works but your back looks as if the Roman's thought you we're the Messiah. The red cut marks go away in a day or two so unless you wanna claim you we're in a cage fight use a couple days before you go shirtless in public. The problem is even with the longer handle you cant always cut straight causing it to bite maybe more practice and it gets better. So ask yourself how bad is a hairless back worth??
2,"Good idea, bad implementation","I have to agree with a lot of the others.... the Mangroomer does a good job of reaching all those hard-to-reach areas, but once it gets there, WATCH OUT. It will cut, scrape, pinch and irritate your skin. I've gotten serious skin infections after using the Mangroomer because it cuts the skin so readily.I don't know why they couldn't have used a more sophisticated and better-designed razor, the one that's there is extremely cheap and does a better job cutting skin than it does cutting hair.I wish Norelco would make a device like this, using the razor mechanism in their BodyGroom, that would be a great product."
1,Mangroomer,"The head broke the second time I used it and will not go back on, $40 for a one time use."
1,Faulty design,I purchased this item and was dissapointed with its performance and design. The shaving head is curved at around 75 degrees to the body and this design along with the quality of blades will not cut the hair. Gets stuck on hair and will not cut even with brand new batteries. I am returning it.
2,It works...but for how long?,"First off, the product does work as described. However, this thing is one of the most cheaply constructed, flimsy products I have ever used. The plastic is incredibly cheap and brittle and would not likely survive a 2-3 foot drop onto anything other than padded carpet. After about the 3rd or 4th time using mine, the adjuster button for the extension arm snapped off inside from simply pressing it in, so now it will no longer lock in position at the various extension intervals. Also the thing would not power on after only a few uses unless I banged on it repeatedly (I made sure good batteries were in it first). All-in all, like I said the shaver does a decent job without biting the skin but the price is outrageous for the poor quality of materials, construction and sheer lack of engineering. If I had to guess, one of these probably costs around $1.50 to make. I am currently looking for a better-made alternative to this product and I suggest others do the same."
2,"Helps reach difficult areas, but that's about it really.","This item is not very well made, does not always work to specification (especially the part that bends, which refuses to stay in the position you want it most of the time), does not cut hair very well, and it just feels cheap and flimsy. Oh, and it eats up batteries in minutes. Really not what I expected.I am lucky to be able to reach practically any part of my back with a normal, small shaver. I can understand that this item will be invaluable to anyone who cannot do that, but other than that practical point, this is really very subpar compared to any other trimmer and/or shaver. It really should have a much lower average score."
2,"Doesn't shave close, is flimsy and poorly designed, and overpriced.","It just plain doesn't work. It leaves stubble, not a smooth back. Plus it's flimsy so it doesn't stay in position, and is awkwardly designed. It seems like a good product, but it doesn't work right. The company does a good job of getting fake purchasers to spread buzz and positive reviews -- but it's just hype and clever marketing. It *might* work for a few people with a very certain hair type, very flat backs, or something...but I've tried it a few times and am very disappointed with this shaver. Don't buy it.My recommended alternative is Veet for Sensitive Skin if you want to go smooth, or just an adjustable-length beard or hair clipper to trim. Or you know...a girlfriend who's seen your hairy back but loves you anyway. Unfortunately they don't sell those on Amazon."
2,Man Eater,"What is really remarkable about this product is that while it's fully capable of shredding your flesh, it has a hard time cutting human hair. It's really quite a feat. I assumed that this thing would be like my small personal groomer, just on an extended handle. It's not. It seems there is too much of a gap between the cutting blades to do much. The teeth seem too tall as well, which is why it can grab so much skin, without cutting any hair."
2,wouldnt buy again,"This product does do the job but not very effectively. it does pull hair if it has any length so don't wait too long between uses.it is very cheaply built,the handle cracked the first time I used it so it is now taped.is fairly easy to use but for the money I think it was over priced....."
4,Does what it is designed to do,"Not much else to say. Relatively simple piece of technology, doesn't cut you and makes life a lot less acrobatic"
4,Works Well,"I would recommend this get rid of that pesky back hair. It isn't especially heavy duty, but does the job. It has a large head and extends so far it would probably go around two people."
4,i didnt even know i had hair there,did you know your back grows hair? oh your back doesnt grow hair? well screw you! JERK!sorry. that was uncalled for. I apologize. I've had a rough week. Anyway this thing is great. Makes it much easier to 'tidy up' my back and is a lot cheaper than having to go to the bus stop and pay some homeless dude to do it for me - i'm not that flexible you see. But this little beauty is excellent at getting those hard to reach places. back is nice and clean now and i no longer have to wear that natural sweater.enjoy!
3,"Good idea, poorly executed","Well it does allow you to shave your back- but the trimmer does not give you a close shave! So you get a less hairy back, but it's still a hairy back!!"
5,shipment,good information about the shipment is provided and I get the item even faster than what was minted to .
3,Needs a locking mechanism,"This shaver will trim your hair, but not shave it close like a foil razor. I ended up using a Norelco body groom, which gets very close without irritation. I still use the Mangroomer occasionally to reach places I cannot reach with the NOrelco, which has a very short handle. I can only use the Mangroomer by holding it with the upper end of the handle, the part near the razor head. If I try to use the lower handle past the point where the folding joint is located, the razor flops around and is uncontrollable. Did anyone every bother to test this thing? They developed a long folding handle which would probably work very well, except that it won't hold it's angle and just flops all over the place. Really annoying!!!"
4,It does what it says,"This thing works pretty well. It is very useful if you are not a contortionist and have an annoying patch of hair on your back. It unfortunately seems like its not really made too well, but what do you expect for $25?"
1,Waste of Money,Does not work - get clogged with hair and all it's useful for is an expensive back scratcher. I am very disappointed in this product.
4,Not as bad as you think........,"So I bought this a few days ago and when it arived I was excited to try it out. When I opened the box I felt let down, I was expecting something well put together but it felt very flimsy. So I placed the batteries in and gave it a shot and to my freaking surprise it worked pretty freaking well. It took a few more passes to get it all off but it did the job. Worth the $25 bucks I spent. I would have given it 5 stars but I thought it could be more solid. Hope this helps!"
3,A bit overpriced,"After reading reviews I went and bought this. Great idea and definitely makes it easier getting to the back. Did not have much trouble with it not wanting to cut my hair, but I had previously trimmed it down and used this while my hair was already really short so not much trouble for it. My only real problem with this is the price, I don't really understand why this costs more then $10 or $15. Feels like its cheap, and doesn't even have it's own battery like all other shavers in this category. Unfortunately there's nothing else out there I know of that's as convenient as this so your stuck with this if you don't have anyone to help you."
4,"Does the job, but cheap construction","The mangroomer works pretty well to get those hard to reach areas on your back, I found that the blades cut pretty close and as long as you don't press too hard won't cause much irritation. The unit is definitely cheaply constructed, which is fairly disappointing considering the price."
1,Waste of time,I just bought this at Target today. I had to wait 25 minutes to get it because THEY didnt even have it on the shelves (nor a spot for it anywhere in the store). Target had to get it from the back. I should have taken the hint. This product sucks. My 10 dollar shaver does a better job at cutting my hair.All the good reviews here must be made by the Mangroomer folks themselves...
2,Not up to par,I used mine 5 times then it broke. Its made of cheap plastic and leaves a lot of stubble. I also went through 2 sets of batteries.
2,"great concept, great product","I'm not sure if I received a defective product...The Mangroomer doesn't do the job it claims to do. I'm very disappointed with the product. It seems people are only happy with it for light touch ups. Don't buy if you are a first time back shaver or seasonal back shaver like myself.*EDIT* As it turns out, I did receive a defective product. The new Mangroomer works very well and I am completely satisfied. Returning the original defective one was a breeze. Both Mangroomer and Amazon were very helpful and provided great customer service.I'd like to change my star rating to a 4 but I don't know how."
1,Piece of Junk,"did not work well, broke on very 1st use. It broke into 5 pieces. No warranty!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!JUNK Not Worth the price. Waist of MOney. Dont Waist your time."
1,0 stars!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Do not waste your money on this product. It does not work, the idea is great and if it had a real razor attached it would be great. It is junk"
1,Terrible Product,"Defective junk, isn't much better than a $4.99 microtouch on a stick. Don't waste your time, there are better products on the market. A high percent of the units are defective. If you get a working one just call and complain, now you just got 2! Hard to use, and terrible job shaving."
5,Hair removal,This is a fantastic back hair removal product. I've used this unit 5x since I purchased it & I couldn't be happier. I was using a hair removal product but use this exclusively now every 2 wks. & I would recommend this product to any man with back hair issues.
5,Simply awesome,"For years, my ex-Freundin had to shave my back. Now I have to do it myself and the MANGROOMER came to my rescue. This unexpansive electrical tool helped me to solve one of my biggest problems in life (life is hard, you know). It's very simple to use, only need two AA batteries and it's helping you to be more flexible and shave you back at the same time. It worked very well."
5,My husband looovvveeessss this!!!,"Got this for my husband as part of his x-mas gifts. He has always bothered me to help keep his back looking human,I haven't seen or heard a peep from him since he's opened this. I think I love it as much as he does. It does a wonderful job. Anyone thinking about purchasing this as a gift or for themselves don't think twice, you'll be glad you bought it."
4,It does the job,"Definatley useful if you are like myself and would like to shave the backrug before you go to the beach. It takes the hair off that it makes contact with pretty easily so keep it away from any hair you don't want removed, it will slice through it like butter.My only complaints are that the head is angled at 90 degrees while the arm only opens to about 135 degrees. It is a little awkward when you are trying to get hairs around your lower back. The head could also be a little wider. For the shaver to work effectively you need to have the entire head level on your back. Being so narrow and trying to shave with your arm behind you tends to make the head tilt. A wider head or a head that can pivot and stay on your back would be useful."
4,thank you,"This is a great product that should be in the hygine aisle of every big box store. Its essential to those who have ""carpets"" on their back, but dont have a sensible way of grooming. Completely worth the price."
3,Moderate performance for a high price,"I've used it 3 times now for my moderate back hair. I think it would work well for light to moderate hair. I don't think I would trust it for more intimate areas of my bod. Since my hair tends to lay down, a back and forth motion seemed to work best for me. It took about 15-20 minutes to do my back, shoulders, and upper arms. Fresh batteries make it work more efficiently. I wasn't impressed with the quality for the price paid. The on/off switch is flimsy and the overall quality reminded me of a cheap flashlight. I would think twice before buying another product from this company. I thought about sending it back but it is handy and the adjustability of the handle is good though it feels fragile. I have gotten much better values from Amazon.com."
4,Mangroomer back shaver,I thought this worked well. All the flexible angles one can use made it easy to reach all areas of the back. The blades were sharp and di a great job very quickly
5,My Boyfriend Loves It!!!,"I got this for my boyfriend as part of his Christmas gift(along with two of their replacement shaver heads for it). He is Italian and does his ""mangrooming"" a couple times a week...He used the mangroomer and said it cut his time in half maybe even more! He's sooo pleased, so I'm happy, :), and he'll probably be writing his own review too, hehe.Happy Holidays & Thanks!!! ;)"
4,Good for the price,"The construction is a little janky, but it works. I'm not sure what the other brands have to offer, but I felt it did well for the price and what I expected out of it."
4,Almost perfect,Works well - makes it easier to reach the hard to reach areas but would be better if there were a slight curve to the handle to make using it even easier
4,Billy Goat,"I've got a patchy coat, so this worked great. Not sure if it would work on really thick hair, but I'm satisfied."
4,Works as advertized,"The product works as promised. It does a good job and the handle extension is very useful. You can easily reach all areas of your back. The shave you get is surprisingly close. Although some reviewers find it cheaply made, for the price it is a good value. Based on what it does and the few options that men with back hair have available, I think it is great. Even if I have to buy one a year, at the price it is worth it. Just keep making them!"
2,"Great handle, poor blade. Works only for those who don't need it.","The handle designn is indeed a great accomplishment, even though it is made of very cheap plastic and it feels as if it could break at any moment. But for the price that's okay, I suppose.The real problem is the blade. It is extremely rough on the skin and it will not, repeat, WILL NOT cut hairs longer than a few millimeters. If you've a rather furry back, forget about this product. You will need to remove the hair some other way first, and then, perhaps, use this as a way to KEEP the hair short. Otherwise you'll just cause yourself a lot of pain (did I mention the blade hurts like the devil?) for no reason.By comparison, the much cheaper Remington BHT-2000 ""precision"" trimmer removes even the longest hairs with practically no pain at all. I almost dislocated a shoulder in trying, but it does work really well. Now I just have to find a way to strap the Remington on the Mangroomer's handle..."
1,Useless piece of junk,Threw it in the trash today - the same day I got it. I doesn't cut the hair. What is the point?
2,Flimsy and Cheaply Built,"I considered submitting a video review and then I imagined hundreds of people collectively ""eeewwwwwwww-ing"".Needless to say, I won't be doing that.What I will say though is that this device is quite flimsy, is VERY hard to use, and does a VERY poor job. The frustration it creates alone would make it worth paying for laser treatment!"
1,Hope you like Cat Marks,"I bought this as a less expensive alternative to a popular brand after reading the reviews and I have the Cat Marks to show for it. The cutting head is cheap and will leave tracks on your back, and I do not have sensitive skin. I pitched it and will buy another brand. Sometimes I have serious doubt on Amazon's review system cause this item is garbage."
1,didn't work after first use...if it worked then,"Blade to cheap, stopped cutting even after cleaning.Purchased spare blade at same time(different vendor)...doesn't fit....right now wasted money and unusable."
2,Low quality junk,I have owned two of these now. After using the first about 5 times it stopped turning on so I returned to Amazon and it was replaced. The second unit's blades were not precise and literally tore the hair off my body. Even the 1st unit was uncomfortable and seemed dull making it painful to use. The best part is the handle obviously but it does not click firmly into position. It is very easy to loose its position with moderate pressure.Once it worked the shave was not close by any means leaving stubble that caught my clothing and more importantly disgusted my girl...nothing like a nice five o'clock shadow on your back!Still tons of room for improvement in this market. Com'on inventors what are you all waiting for. This is probably a 100 million dollar industry waiting to be tapped!
1,Doesn't work,"This thing has a great design approach hampered by an extremely poor cutting device. Basically it barely worked, and it will be going back to Amazon."
1,Not Recommended,I bought this but I can't recommend it. You have to hold the edge flat to the surface which is almost impossible when talking about your back. Either one side or the other digs into the skin. It scratches and hurts. It's sitting in my house gathering dust.
2,Stock up on batteries!,I purchased the mangroomer about 3 months ago and have used it every few weeks. It is still difficult for me to maneuver and the batteries only last about 2 shaves before needing to be replaced. It has a wide blade and does work if your patient enough to go over the same spot a couple of times but I'm left wishing I had purchased the Philips Norelco Bodygroom Shaver instead.
5,A must have,"For any dude with hair in hard to reach places this is a must have. These last for years, give a nice close shave, and are by far the best option I have found."
4,Embarass-free shave,"Need to get rid of that back hair before hitting the pool and don't want to ask anyone else to help you out. Works surprisingly well. Feels a little cheap, but has not broken on me so far. Just don't drop it or I'm sure it will crack. Razor is nice and wide and works well."
3,Hair Remover,Does not really perform very well. It actually sratches when you try to use it. I really wish the design ahd been better.
1,Bad product,The product didnt even work and it was very cheaply made. Horrible product! I would not suggest this to anyone.
3,Does what it says... But ouch!,"So I went through two of these things... Here are the pros and cons...(The ""ouch"" part is at the end.)PROs:I used to have a hair on my back.This thing gets rid of it no problems.It's a cordless electric shaver on a telescoping plastic stick.So simple, yet so brilliant.And a lot cheaper than laser hair removal.CONs:It's a great product that needs to go through a second generation refinement.The construction is generally flimsy.The telescoping plastic arm rattles around more, the more you extend it.I dropped it once, and the entire plastic housing came apart (had to get it replaced.)OUCH:The blades on my second trimmer are, dare I say, TOO sharp.I am NOT putting extra pressure on the blade.Yet if I am anything more than gentle when using it, my back gets all scratched up to the point where it looks like I was making out with a grizzly bear."
1,Broke second time using it,"I bought this for my husband and he was happy he could take care of his back on his own. Admittedly, that is what i was excited about too. Anyway, he followed directions and the head broke off of the handle the second time he used it. It really was poorly constructed. We wondered if it would hold up as soon as we opened the package due to the flimsy feel of the handle. Unfortunately we were correct and since we couldn't return our expensive purchase, we improvised with electrical tape to hold it together. I know, it sounds ghetto rigged, but it worked for a couple of times until it finally met its death. I am very disappointed that this product was so poorly made because it has the potential to be a fantastic product. For now, we have gone back to using Nair."
1,Product quality - aweful,"Received the product in a timely fashion, but took a lot just to get it to operate. Once it was operational, the clippers didn't do anything but vibrate. Did not shave anything.Amazon did not allow for return either even within 30 days."
3,Takes some getting used to,It took some time to understand how the product works. It's hard to keep it clean. And it requires some good hand eye coordination. :)
1,Does not work....,"Horrible product. My husband tried it and it does not work. He went over the same place at least 10 times and it did not remove any hair. He tried to shave in the opposite direction and it just pulled his hairs out, which was very painful. Big waste of money. Would have given 0 stars if I could."
1,junk,The shaver broke the first time I used it so I taped it together. It lasted only a few time after so I threw it away.
2,Not powerful and broken after 6 months!,"I ordered the Mangroomer in november 2011, and at first I was excited about the product. It worked well, but it was always a struggle to clip the hair.After 30 minutes I finally got it, and was very pleased.Unfortunately the Mangroomer broke down this morning. I would not go back on! So after 6 months, and I dont use it every day, the groomer broke down.So very bad product, so I'm looking for a new one."
2,Im sure there are better products,This product is very difficult to use and can only be used for weekly or daily maintenance. This will not work if you have thick hair. It is very painful to use on thicker hair because instead of cutting it will pull the hair out. It is also difficult to use this at the correct angle but when you do finally get it at the right angle it works fine on shorter hair. I would not recommend this product.To improve this product they need to make a more powerful trimmer preferably with removable heads so that it will be easier to clean and maintain.Another improvement would be to place the head at a better angle so it isnt so hard to maneuver.
4,works but for how long?,I didn't want to shave (since i'm covered with hair) so i decided to try this buzzer. I couldn't believe how easily it worked with little effort. I did get some irritation but most went away after showering. My only concern is how long it could last since it didn't feel like it was assembled too well but i think i'll get a few uses out of it before then. I would recommend trying this electric shaver to anyone before investing more money into other options.
4,Not Bad!,I found this product more than adequate. It made quick work of my back and shoulder hair. I did however find it a little too rigid. The product could benefit from a pivoting head.
4,GREAT,At first it's a little weird to get used to..The second use was much easier..What a great product..I would recommend this to anyone with a hairy back
4,Great way to keep the hair on your back away,"I have thought about buying this for a long time, and finally decided to because of the good price on Amazon.com When I got the Mangroomer, it was easy to put the batteries in and easy to figure out how to use it. It does take a little while to get use to tilting the head correctly to shave the hair effectively, but once you get the hang of it, it works great.I do find the angle to feel a little flimsy, when you snap it into the specific angle you want, it wiggles, a benefit of this, is it allows the mangroomer to move and adjust easier to your back. but they could have spend a little more engineering to make it feel less cheaply made.I have had this for a week, used it once, cant wait to try it again. No longer do I have to worry about hair all over my back. The extender does a great job getting to the lowest part of my back and I would recommend this to anyone who wants to get rid of hair on their back."
5,Great Back Hair Remover,Bought one of these before and I broke it. So I bought another one and I'm now relieved of itchy back hair problems. I know they make a professional model but have yet to chance and try it. It's more expensive but have yet to see that model up close. They both look the same from the pictures.
5,Phenomenal Product!,"I ordered this product yesterday after reading everyone's reviews here. In my last relationship my girlfriend use to nair my back for me...but alas all good things come to an end. So when I saw this I thought it was a God send...and sure enough once I used it it was.The product is light and made out of plastic but don't let that fool you. You will thank the makers if you have a lot of back hair, like me, cause it took a bit to do the whole thing. The blade is awesome and I even used it to shave my chest (also very hairy) and it did a great job!A tip, try going back and forth with the blade instead of in just one direction (i.e. Kinda like a vacuum)I am really pleased with this product and thank everyone here for helping me make my decision. Sometimes you order something and don't have any user opinions and it is a shot in the dark with some products!"
1,OUCH,This thing snapped at my skin like it was mad at me. I've been using clippers my entire life and have NEVER been so scratched up. Everywhere I touched this thing to my skin it left stripes - I have already returned it and will say something positive now. Thank you Amazon for making it easy to return stuff!!!
3,Good but lacks in quality,"Unlike the trimmer from the same company, this trims/shaves to the skin so in essence it does a great job at that. However the main drawback is that it's very very loud. I do mean loud, so don't try this at night while others are sleeping. And i'm not sure if it's just the one i got, the shaver is very cheaply made, it's very loose and does not hold it's different angles. Otherwise a decent working product."
2,Don't do it yourself,"I was so excited to get this product since it is hard to get people to shave your back. I didn't think much of this when I tried it though. It works only OK and leaves you instead of an all over hairy back, a patchy one instead. Save your money and just find someone else to do it."
2,Ouch!,"An innovative product that just does not work very well. It does it's job of removing unwanted hair, but it also takes a lot of skin with it. Your back may look like it's had an encounter with a clawed creature, as mine did.The problem lies in the head design. It is bare metal against bare metal, like most shavers, but there is nothing preventing it from grabbing, or rubbing your skin right off your back. Since the moving blade is flush with the ""guard"", it just chews you right up.I cannot give this product a recommendation until the head design improves."
3,its ok..,"hey..it has a good reach..a little cheaply made, blades are good, overall- not bad.. but it could be a better product"
1,BUYER BEWARE,Do not buy this product. It is cheaply made and does not work. Worked ok for about 10 seconds and that was it. Worst product that I have ever bought. PIECE OF JUNK!!
1,mangroomer review,The shaver won't will not cut my arm or back hair. At first I thought it was the angle of the shaver to my back but it doesn't matter how I tilt the shaver it will not cut the hair on my body. I threw away the packaging or I would have sent it back for a refund. It hasn't worked for me at all and I'm very unhappy with this purchase
2,Owch!,"Being your typical big, macho, hairy guy, I've got hair growing everywhere. So when I'm checking out this months Maxim magazine, I see the ""man groomer"". For once, I thought, there's a neat idea. So today I hit the local bed, bath and beyond and drop $40 on one of these gadgets.I popped a couple AA batteries in and pulled the t-shirt off. Bzzzzz... owch! Ok, so it pulls some hair. I go back and forth trying different angles and bupkis. Don't get me wrong, I'm no sasquach but I've got more hair than just fuzz. I was greatly dissappointed by this product. After evaluating first hand, I'd give this gadget a 3 out of 10. I'll be returning it for a full refund tomorrow."
4,A little awkward but it works,It is good at cutting short hair but longer hair takes a couple of passes.
3,"Great Idea, Needs to be better quality",The idea is fantastic. Currently there is nothing else on the market that does the same job. The quality of this item could be much better. The first unit I got didn't work but was quickly replaced at no charge. I would recommend but check the item very well when it is received.Nick
3,Great product but lasts 2 hours total,"I bought this 2 years ago and until recently has worked great. It takes about 15 minutes to get the entire back and shoulders. Some bleeding but nothing too dramatic that a shower can't handle. I was very satisfied with the close shave it gave me. I got 8 sessions of 15 minutes each out of the Groomer over a 2 year period , so it comes out to just over $5 per session. I tried 4 different sets of new batteries and still nothing, unit was completely inoperative.There was no response from customer service so I couldn't get a handle on what was going on with the unit. So now I'm deciding whether I buy another one. $5 a session compared to what waxing costs is still a pretty good deal. I'll keep looking out there for another product that may be more durable that has the long handle feature that separates this groomer from the others."
2,Ow!,"First time I used this, it worked ""ok"". Not a very close shave, but better than nothing. The second time, my back ended up looking like I got beaten with a belt. I literally have red welts in the exact width of this thing's shaving blade crisscrossing my back. And no, I didn't press too hard, I let it rest against my skin while I slid it across.So if you like that just tortured feeling, go for it. In my case, I'm leaning forward while typing this review."
2,Grabs skin instead of cutting hair,"They used a crappy clipper. It really doesn't cut hair all that well, but it does leave a lot of welts.I have a Norelco beard trimmer that is far superior. If only I could somehow put those blades on this handle."
2,Cheap stuff - high price!,"I read all the negative reviews on this and still went to buy it hoping they were just being overly critical.This device is the worst clipper I've ever had...would have been better to attach a stick to my beard trimmer.It's horribly cheap plastic, like something you'd buy at a flea market...the blade is way too close to the skin and makes it look like you made love with a wolverine when you're done, then you go to take a shower and that's the most excruciating shower you'll probably ever have.The only reason this thing got 2 stars from me is because it is the only thing like it I could find and I applaud the inventor of the idea...the product itself is a ripp off and not worth it at half the price!"
2,Its just OK,it made of the poorest quality materials. Also it does not come with batteries. It did an fair job on my back. A smaller groomer I was using before does a better job but this is easier to reach those hard to get areas. So until someone comes up with a better made groomer this might be it.
2,Worked OK when it worked.,"I've used it maybe 3 times and during those times it functioned. Yes it scratched and left marks, but I'm not too surprised that it did. It removed the hair and the handle was helpful.But on about my 4th time using it (after a long time just sitting there) it powered on for half a second and then died. Inserted new batteries and it didn't even turn on. Tested the batteries...they're fine. Removed batteries, reinserted a few times...same thing. I don't see anything wrong with the connections the batteries are making.So for a product to die after so little use is very sad. And it wasn't even the part I was most worried about (the somewhat flimsy feeling plastic shell)."
4,Have to use it twice,"The first time I tried the Mangroomer, it had been a while since I been clipped and the hair was a little long, but not exactly bushy. There seemed to be more pulling then clipping and I finally had to use regular clippers to remove the hair. I was convinced I lost my $40. The second time I had about a 1/4 inch of growth and it worked like a charm taking it down close, not razor close but good enough. It takes some getting used to working backwards in the mirrow, but overall it does what its intended to do. Just keep in mind a short base of hair is required."
4,Good Product,"Pretty good considering design/ergonomic difficulties with product like this. Requires some care & practice to use effectively without scratching or nicking yourself. To get a close cut, and because shaver edge must move against skin while perpendicular to body, the top & bottom blades are set at the same place--unlike, say, a regular barber's electric trimmer on which the bottom blade extends a bit beyond the top blade and the shaver moves along the skin surface parallell to it. Hence, blades are more likely to nick the skin unles you hold the shaver edge evenly against the skin surface. That's why you have to practice a bit, perhaps making a few runs with the shaver off. In any case, once you get the hang of it, it does a good enough job so that you no longer need to rely on your spouse or partner--or the sadists who do back waxing."
4,This works for maintenance,"This unit works, but primarily for maintenance. If you have a ""pelt"" it will not work well as the primary treatment. I had to remove as much hair as I could with an electric trimmer, and then use the Mangroomer. Then it functions to keep the hair down. So get someone to help you with the first trimming, and then use this to keep the back hair in check."
4,Works almost perfect,"Works great just have to be careful about irratation from the edges of clippers, but a close cut otherwise"
3,underpowered,"The design of the handle is great and makes it possible to easily reach anywhere on your back (or elsewhere for that matter). It is possible to get a pretty good shave with it. What I don't understand is why they chose to go with the AA battery power. This is the reason many (including myself) are complaigning about irritation and the feel of pulled hairs. The blades are just not moving fast enough. Pretty much any other electronic shaver/body groomer on the market will either be run off AC or have a pretty beefy rechargeable battery, but of course none of those have the handle necessary. The profit they must be making off of each one of these must be outstanding, because the money is not going to materials."
5,Mangroomer works as advertised,"The Mangroomer works very well. It can reach all areas of a back. It does take several attempts and a bit of getting accustomed to using it, but all-in-all it works very well."
4,"as advertised, easy to use","works well, not hard to maneuver with either arm, comfort and quick, The sound is barely audible and results are easily seen close cut each time."
3,flimsy/effective,"the handle feels flimsy as if it may break off, but it gets the job done. shaver doesnt pull or snag."
1,"Clever Design, Cheaply Made","This product is a great idea, but cheaply made. The quality is no better than you'd find at a $5 shaver at a flea market. It left razor burn all over my back because the blade guard is apparently non-existent. At $25, I expected much more. I will be returning the item."
3,"works on the back, but cheap construction","Worked fine for about 6 months, then the coil spring holding the battery broke, rendering it useless. Similar problem with the Norelco Bodygroomer where the pushbutton on/off button ceased to work after about a year."
3,Good Idea with Exception,"This product is a good idea for an unassisted serious need. The exception is the battery operation. Use drains the batteries within 2-3 uses. It should have an AC option. The razor isn't the sharpest knife in the drawer, either. Several passes are required to eliminate back hair."
3,OK,Works ok. The actual clippers are nit fine enough to take the hair down. Needs the head from the Bodygroomer.
2,Skip it,"Used this for the first and maybe last time yesterday. If you have a little hair on your back, this is fine. If you have more than a little (like me), it stunk. Painful and awkward to use. I had to ask my wife to finish it. I will opt for a better trimmer and a bottle of Nair next time. Did I mention it was Painful. I like the idea of it, but not the product. I would spend your money on a better trimmer."
2,"Cheap Plastic Trimmer DOES NOT ""Shave""","This thing is a trimmer, NOT a shaver. It leaves stubble, so don't expect great results. It's also very poorly made. The battery cover falls off easily and when it doesn't, hair trimmings enter the battery compartment. The handle is wobbly. The whole thing is made from the cheapest of plastics. Honestly, this is the junkiest thing I have purchased in a long time. It belongs in a dollar store and is certainly not worth the $40! I only wish there were more alternatives."
1,POS,This has got to be the worst product I have ever bought. What little hair that did come off of me with this thing was just pulled out. It doesn't shave worth a darn. I'm looking into finding a way to return this product and I can't recommend this product to my wort enemy!!
1,OUCCCHhhhh! Better off with Nair.,"The directions suggest it may take time for skin to adjust/experience minor irritation ---- to clip the hair (sure I have some, but I'm not sasquatch) seemed to also take a layer of skin with it... it is a rather awkward tool to use. Rather uncomfortable--for days! I'll just stick with Nair."
1,Torture device,"Device is very cheaply made - powered off a single AA battery, I was worried before I ever applied the blade to my back. Immediately ripped out a handful of hair; upon close examination of the shave head it was clear that the cheap plastic housing had been assembled improperly. Returned immediately; will look for something well-made or will just go back to my au natural state."
1,Came broken in the package,"Wow. So I was skeptical, but went for it, because I hate my back hair. I took it out of the package and the shaving head was in two pieces. Not good. Who knows if it works? I didn't even get to try it. Customer lost. Returning...Updated - I called the company before returning it and they took my info and said they'd get back to me in 48 hours after reviewing the sale from Amazon, then likely send a replacement. They never got back to me. Brutal."
2,Works... But Not Impressive,I have used several different types of Self-Groomers for back hair. This does cut hair but it's not very impressive and there is a lot of afterwork to do.
3,It does work but with some patience,"This product is far from excellent - and that's what's frustrating about it, because it should be. Putting some clippers on a stick is not what I'd call an engineering feat and in fact, I but you could make a better one with a stick and some duct tape...but you won't so read on.Main complaints are that the clippers are really low quality and only work well with hair that's already short. The first time you use this thing you'll be in pain and it will take over 1 hour to shave that hairy back (if you're part simian like myself). You'll be tempted to send it back, but don't. After that first grueling session, if you keep a regular grooming regimen it will be much easier, faster, and way less painful.Bottom line - it's not a great product and it hurts at first but it's the only way I know of to have a back that's not apelike and for that alone I would recommend you buy it. You'll be amazed at how much better you look!"
2,More of a gimmick,"Really tried to like it, but didn't work like I had hoped. Didn't remove hair in a very consistent manner and caused irritation. DId not use but 3-4 times and threw away."
1,Poor quality recently,"I've used four of these over the past six years, replacing them as they wear out (they start pulling hair rather than cutting). They used to last about one year on average. My last one wore out after three months. Its replacement has stopped cutting and started pulling hair after three weeks. The quality isn't there anymore, look elsewhere."
3,Recommended for hair control,"Overall this groomer does what it says it does. It takes a couple AA batteries and takes the hair off.Pros: Shipping took less than two weeks. If you are thick in the waist and/or back and shoulders, this product works. I have patches on my back and was able to reach them all. The handle extends with ease. It easily takes off hair.Cons: It feels cheap as it is made of mostly plastic. Also, when using it extended and with the sharper angle, it tends to pop out of the the angle into the less angled position. When using just be gentle when trimming your back, the blades work really well.The trimmer is kind of loud too and seems to rattle the plastic parts."
4,hello beach or pool,"This is my second mangroomer, my first one was dropped by careless roommate. The product works excellent it can get to all the spots. Do not use it in the shower, use it right when you get out.No more painful waxing or having to cover up your back with a t shirt. Depending on your genes you might have to use the product twice a week but few minutes its worth it!"
3,Good idea in theory,"I took a chance on this, and have to say it worked pretty good. It's not going to give you 100% smooth results but does a pretty good job once you get used to it. If you're gonna walk around the beach from a distance your back will probably look fine, but it's not going to give results of a razor. The problem is it seems very cheep in the way it's made, and after a few tries this thing is broke and no longer works at all. I see there's now a re-chargeable one out, but I'm not sure it's made any better besides not requiring batteries. I would purchase another one, even at a higher price if it were made better."
2,Not satisfied,"I have used this product in the past and was satisfied...kind of. My first time the device lasted a few months and then it just died. I replaced it with this second device and it only lasted a couple weeks. I love the idea of the device and when it works it works great, but it just doesnt last very long. Wish I could have gotten more for what I paid for."
1,pulls hair doesn't cut,Beware. This trimmer is PAINFUL and completely ineffective. Do not waste your time and money. It is not eligible for return and you WILL want to return it.. Cheaply made gimicky waste of money. Suck it up and ask a friend to trim your back.
2,mangroomer good idea but not a good product,"very substandard finishing of product, it seems its a sample. Gr8 idea but product doesn't have good trimming capability what it is meant for and handle in different position has very loose fit."
2,Product isn't great,"This product worked effectively twice and then started breaking down. The battery cap started to fall off and the shaver would shut down every 30 seconds or so, even with new batteries. not worth the money"
2,No shaving power!,"If this were a plug-in appliance, it would be much better. (it is battery operated)It has cut me many, many times.Angle of the head is not optimal for getting most of my back hair. (it is difficult to ""push"" clipper, rather than ""pull"")bottom line: when I first bought this, I was excited. It was first time I had ever seen anything like this. The are others out there now. Try those ones instead of the mangroomer."
2,"Good idea, but cheaply made.",This was a good idea because of the long handle but mine only lasted a few months and then just stopped working.
3,"Works, but does have issues","It absolutely removes the hair and in places that are impossible to reach without someone else to help, so it's less embarassing. It is not a clean shave, though, so while it improves back hair problems, it does not eliminate them. It is cheaply constructed, which is concerning. It sucks batteries very quickly."
3,groomer shaver,"Should be sold for $19.95,,,,needs a feature to lock in place and open to a larger degree. But if ur looking for something in-expensive, this is ur product!!"
3,It works but it's very cheaply made.,"When I received this item I was surprised at how cheaply made it seems. The hinge in the center does not lock so the end of the groomer wobbles when you hold it by the handle. Was also surprised to find that this item operates on AA batteries instead of a chargable internal battery. Maybe I should have read the fine print on that one, so it's on me. When I used the groomer it seems to work alright. With the exception of the wobbly handle it is easy to maneuver around my back and seems to cut easily. It's not the closest shave, but it gets the job done. I have only had it a couple of weeks and have only used it once. I am curious to see how long it will last given it's cheap construction. I hope it surprises me and lasts a long time, but I'm not holding my breath."
4,back hair be gone!,"Got this a couple weeks ago and finally tried it out. Operating it while looking in the mirror took a little getting used too, but it works great."
4,My wife says Thanks!,"I wish that it cost less, but not having to ask my wife to shave my back before I go swimming is worth every penny.It does a great job and I can do the job quickly. Most importantly, I CAN DO IT MYSELF!"
4,best thing for back hair,"This works really well. A little flimsy, but it shaves very close. You can't even tell I have back hair when I'm done, and it reaches every inch of my back."
5,mangroomer,I think that the mangroomer is a great product. Small and light weight. Works great to keep a clean smooth back or chest. Bout time a man can shave his own back! LOL-
4,"Good product, good price","I just got the mangroomer yesterday. It seems to work well. Easy to use. The quality does seem a bit cheap, so I'll see how well it holds up after time.I think if you have a ton of back hair, this product might not work well. I guess i have a ""medium"" amount of back hair--and it seemed to work well."
5,Gorilla no more!,"The first time I used this, I knew this was a great product. Previously I strapped my Norelco Bodygroom to a back scratcher with numerous rubber bands, and achieved limited success. With the Mangroomer, I have very good control over my entire back. The shave is comfortable and close, but the blades aren't sharp enough to disturb warts or other skin imperfections. Using a mirror can be tricky, so for the most part I do it by feel, and check my results periodically. I was initially hesitant to buy this, fearing a cheaply made product due to the low cost, but I'm pleasantly surprised at the quality I'm actually receiving."
4,works great,"I bought this razor and once I figured out how to use it properly it worked great. Second time I used it, it slipped out of my hand and broke. I was pretty mad since I had just got it. I wrote to the company and they replacesd if for me. If you have a hairy back this will help you out greatly. It does a good job."
1,No customer service,"The unit stopped working after 45 days. The company would not respond or back their product. Only a 30 day warranty. I tried to repair it myself - I disassembled it and moved the wires on the motor and it has worked ever since. The product performs its function ok (adequate, not great), just did not like the poor quality. I am surprised Amazon is carrying the product again."
1,Very Pleased At First.............. But..............,"I bought this product and used it three times. The first time it worked great, second time (with fresh batteries) the power mechanism started to poop out but finished the job. The third time (with fresh batteries) it simply quit halfway through using it. I then purchased another one and the same sequence of events happened. If they were smart, they would make one that actually plugs into the wall with better construction for the clippers and power mechanism. I would pay double for that if it meant it wouldn't die out after only three uses. Each use basically cost me $14.00. Very disappointed."
1,"great idea, terrible product",the mangroomer has a great design: it really lets you reach every part of your back. the problem is that it eats your skin! i had huge red welts after a few seconds of using the mangroomer. it took a couple of days for my skin to calm down. .
1,Doesn't work at all,I had high hopes for this product. It unfortunately doesn't remove any hair. The razor is not effective. The construction is cheep. I think this is a good idea poorly executed.
1,Misleading advertising.,"This is NOT a ""mini"" cassette recorder/player. It uses standard size audiocassettes, not the true minicassettes, which are slightly larger than a microcassette. Please call it what it really is! I have already ordered and received a so-called minicassette recorder and have had to send it back.Mark A. Bauer"
2,Noisy motor,"I should have listened to the reviewer who said the motor was noisy. I'm very disappointed with this cassette player. I like to listen to relaxation tapes at night, and I need to move the unit far away from me just to use it, because otherwise the motor sound is too distracting."
1,Don't Waste your money,I bought this tape recorder and was very disapppointed. The sound quality is just horrible. Don't buy.
5,Galinsky is right on the mark -,"This is a terrific book! Finally, we have something that deals head-on with parent-child communication from BOTH sides. Galinsky's insight and tips are invaluable. I would recommend this book to anyone who balances going to work and raising children. It's already changed the dynamics between myself and my kids with regard to work."
3,Gator Puppet Hat,"Arrived in time. Puppet hat was somewhat squashed (ears, eyes, tail). Otherwise it was OK for the purpose of cheerleading for our team."
2,Syn review - forgettable DVD,"I'm a Yes fan, I bought this to see what the Syn was all about - forgettable music, really didn't find anything compelling whatsoever about their music. Probably a band that was laid to rest way back when - and should have stayed that way."
3,Great if you were there,"OK, Nardelli can't sing. Let's just get that out of the way.But Alan White and Chris Squire can surely play, and that makes up for a lot of other things. The footage of White is great -- he looks like he's having a ball.I was in the second row right in front of Squire, so my concert experience was at least as good as anything on this DVD, but the DVD does help bring it back."
1,Horrible Sound Distortion!,Unplayable due to horrible sound distortion on DVD. Tried to play on several different DVD machines.
5,A Fun family to watch.,"This is a fun show to watch. There is also an education that goes along with this show, at least for me it is an education. There are two dwarf parents, Amy and Mat. They are parenting four kids. 15/16 year old twins. One tall boy & one Dwarf boy. A 12/13 year old girl normal height and a 9/10 year old boy normal height. It is a chore when parenting the twins. Especially when the taller twin starts to talk back and the dwarf twin analyzes everything the father does in trying to get the taller twin to do the work needed. Mat really needs be married to Amy. She is the reason, the master mind behind the parenting. Matt is usually there to get things done, but there are times Amy needs to finesse the work her husband does."
5,EXCELLENT REALITY SHOW! GREAT FOR THE ENTIRE FAMILY!! GOTTA GET THIS ONE!,"With three little ones in the house its hard to catch anything on tv that isn't a cartoon. My husband and I are hooked on this reality show which is still on TLC. Once you start watching it you want to see more. You can learn so much from the Roloff family. I have been waiting for them to come out with these DVD's by season. I'm excited to see they are putting out season one and hope that they continue release all of the seasons here on after. I plan on introducing this program to my children as they get older (my oldest is 6). You get a better understanding of what ""little people"" go through in our big world. It's really neat watching all of the Roloff children grow up. You won't regret it pre-order your DVD today!"
1,ripp off!!!,"This product is actually amazing, but this seller is a ripp off!!! u can get this product brand new from the actual seller La Mer website for $65 or on Ebay for $50."
5,Compact but far ranging,"It lacks an index, but helpful headings on almost every page help you find sections. Really ""covers the map"" including topics such as Irish Traditional Music in Quebec or The Scots-Irish in the Appalachians. It profiles important musicians in the history of Irish music, but I wanted more details on the recent (1970s-2000) artists.The list of traditional music organizations, glossary, discography and note on session etiquette were useful.Good for getting the basic background on Irish music, but I recommend taking a look at Far from the Shamrock Shore for a more emotional, yet historical look at the same topic."
1,Not worthy of the Fisher-Price or Little People name...,"We did not like this CD, nor did we like the ""Songs about your Neighborhood"" one. Both have been discontinued by F.P., which is no surprise to me. I was so impressed with the Fisher-Price Little People ""Birthday Party Fun"" CD (we absolutely LOVE it!) that I wanted to get some more Little People CD's for my daughter. We basically dislike all the songs on both of these two CD's. Many are completely different from the versions you are used to. While we were listening to this CD, my 13-year old said ""Mom, this CD is depressing."" I really wish I hadn't wasted my money. Maybe I can sell them on Ebay....I also have ""Baby Boogie"", and at least it has upbeat songs, but no words, and the tunes are different than you'd expect. If you want a really wonderful, upbeat, energizing CD for your toddler / young child, hold out for the ""Birthday Party Fun"" CD."
2,What happened?,"As always, the artistic value is great, but what happened to the story? Although I did not find The Gryphon & Alexandria as compelling as the original trilogy, it still had a decent story line to follow.I have to say that I was deeply disappointed with how the story concluded. There was no real closure, and it seemed that the ending was rushed and not really well planned out. I basically felt like this book was strictly to showcase the art rather than the text content. Such a sad thing.It had the making of being something so classical and great, but fell flat on its face. I would recommend that readers stick with the original Griffin & Sabine trilogy and stop there."
2,Huh?,"Beautiful artwork, but after six volumes, readers of this series will find themselves sorely disappointed. What is the mysterious connection between Griffin and Sabine, Matthew and Isabella? What is the significance of the artifact in the desert? What did Matthew mean in the last book when he said, ""They are coming--both of them""? Where, precisely are Griffin and Sabine trapped? What, exactly, is Minnaloushe? What is Frolatti's stake in all this? What is this store of knowledge he is trying to keep hidden? Did Matthew and Isabella's union open it? Well then, what was it? Sorry, Mt. Bantock, but a one-liner about science and art merging, or something to that effect (I'm badly misquoting), simply will not do. There was room in this story for some questions to be left unanswered, to allow the reader to ponder, but not every question. I have a genius IQ, but I didn't get it, and, judging by these reviews, neither did anyone else."
2,"Uh, the artwork is still beautiful. I guess.","I dislike being a conformist but I have to go with the crowd here when I say ""Huh?"" I loved the Griffin & Sabine series but the Matthew/Isabella reprisal just left me confused and mostly dissatisfied. To give Nick Bantock credit though, the Griffin & Sabine series was more creative than anything I will ever achieve in my life, so I'll give him snaps for that and move on."
2,And The Point Was.......?,"When a sincere Bantock admirer, a faithful purchaser of his books, AND a fairly bright woman can't ""get"" it, well, something is amiss. The impact of his art remains fresh with all its texture, depth and excitement, but...ummm....what was the point? Maybe I'm overthinking the work in trying to link it to Yeat's great beast slouching toward Bethlehem, or Nostradamus' quatrains, or...for goodness sake, just the simple nod towards male/female union. But Yikes! It took six books (and years & years) to tell the tale, and I honestly don't know what the tale was. A body of work this wonderful ought not be leaving the reader feeling empty or stupid. My two-star ranking was a compromise: five stars for the art and minus three for the story. Sorry, Nick."
2,Beautifully trite,"Usually, I find Nick Bantock's books enchanting and full of visual and literary surprises. Unfortunately, _The Morning Star_ cannot be counted as one of these delights. The only thing that keeps it from being a complete waste of time is all the captivating collage and mail art. The story itself wraps up the series in a very expected, ordinary manner that's not worthy of all the luscious art. Bantock has told us this story before and he's told it much better (when he gave us _The Venetian's Wife_). You won't have the sense of satisfaction that you read the final chapter of a wonderful series, you'll just feel cheated."

4,true!,"Quality of service and product is perfect, that is all i have to say thanks! is not that enough informantion? I do not like the system decides how many words I have to sayit is easier do not rate products"
2,Not as good as it might have been,"I love Dick Francis and wanted to love Lyndon, but I gave up trying. I like the style it is written in and the basic Francis-esque scene it paints, but I was waiting and waiting and waiting some more to 'feel' something for the characters. The story was going along fine I guess, but I just felt no empathy for anyone. After 20 pages of Dick Francis I am often feeling the pain and the joy of his main character and I guess this makes it sound like I was expecting a Francis masterpiece, and this was the real cause for the let down, but I honestly think that the two dimensional characters were the back breaker for me.I will try another Lyndon Stacey, but I don't reckon I will make number three unless number two does something for me."
4,Daughter - cna,"I purchased 2 of the stethoscopes for my girls they are going to school to be a nurse, They were purchased for them to practice on. Both of my children seem to be very pleased with the purchase I made for them."
2,Overall Quality,"After 4 months of limited useage in an EMS course the Lumiiscope failed entirely on me. I can't say it was the same model (the model isn't printed on the thing)but ...it was a close model. It is not one that I want to rely on however.The model I have was never used over 20 times. Then one day I tried to take a BP and it choked above 40....then suddenly sprang to 300 and the proverbial ""ping"" occured. It decided after that everything was 120!~I'm saving the cuff...but ..I really don't want to go back to that day when I had to rely on it.Robin"
3,Good IF heart beat strong,"Works fine. Readings match doctor's office and devices in pharmacies for customer use.BUT, if the machines in pharmacies sometimes fail to give you a reading at all, you may not be able to hear the pulse on this stethoscope.The product works fine for me. Useless for my wife (for reason noted above)."
1,What a bummer.,"What a bummer. I bought this for a gift for a patient of mine where I volunteer here in Uganda, Africa, and had a friend bring it over. It reads about 20 points below zero with no pressure. It needs calibration straight out of the box. The $5.00 cost to send it in for recalibrating is no help from Afirca, and the poor baseline calibration took all the joy our of giving my patient a self empowering gift, as well as all the value. A total waste of $20.00 There is no way for the user to self calibrate, so all i can do is tell my patient to subtract 20 from his readings. Very dissatisfying."
1,Not worth the money,This product is not calibrated and was way off. It did not hold calibration after I took it in to be adjusted and now too late to return. Very unsatisfied with product. Shipping was fast
2,Lumiscope 100-019 Manual BP Monitor with Poor Stethoscope,"BP cuff is great the stethoscope is very, very, very poor quality and would not encourage anyone to purchase the set if they want a quality BP reading."
5,Good for all ages,Good family movie. Good quality entertainment. I Recommend it highly. Quality of this product is excellent.
5,Fabulous!,"I had forgotten how wonderful this show was until I got this recently! How fun! The flying effect is almost hilarious, you can see the lines at times as she flies and it is just so low tech compared to what we are used to nowadays! I loved the fun running plot of the gambling womanizing wealthy man on the island all of a sudden helping the convent after seeing the Flying Nun fly. And seeing the hip portrayals of go go dancers in cages, etc. at Carlos' casinos is aged and funny too. Sally Field moves on from Gidget into this role with spunk: she comments when the sisters pick her up upon arriving at the convent that she was recently arrested at a free speech rally! The scenery is stunning: the red-tiled roof of the convent hanging on the cliff over the ocean is gorgeous...not sure where they filmed those shots, but the old cobbled streets and tight neighborhoods look authentic. A light-hearted, kindly tv series worthy of a second watch."
4,Brings back silly fun from the 60's as a kid,"Though Sally Field candidly explains how she disliked doing 'The Flying Nun', it answers questions about why her acceptance speech 'You like me, you really like me'. It was a tough decision as an actor to take a part that in her gut she really wanted to pass on and it proved to be the butt of a joke on her for many years - a cloud over her budding hopeful career. How uplifting it was Sally Field rose above the silly series character to become one of our most famous and twice Academy Award winning actress of our age. I say 'Go Girl!' and I have nothing but fond memories of 'The Flying Nun' and have enjoyed seeing is again on this DVD set."
5,Closed Captions,"I finally received this DVD The Flying Nun season 1. It has Closed Captions. It works in my PC DVD player, not normal DVD Player (Australia).It should shows a back of this DVD where it can see ""CC""."
3,Shedding some light on humanism.,The notion that humanism cannot be considered a religion is very naive at best. It would be quite the misconception to believe that no one will ever take humanistic philosophy and reform it to a religious faith. It is happening. Those who believe humanism can never be a religion may be those who are not aware that they are practicing a religion. This book shines some light on that issue.
1,"Misguided, uninformed rant","Ehrenfeld doesn't seem to really understand humanism or humanist principles -- or for that matter he doesn't even seem to have a good grasp of general philosophy. Humanism is in no way a religion, and anyone who imagines it is is simply not well-informed or experienced in the subject. This book is one long misguided, opinionated rant."
5,Best Cookbook Ever,"If you enjoy cooking, consider yourself somewhat of a foodie and love wine then this cookbook is for you. My husband and I make dishes from this about 3 times a week and wish another version with even more delicious recipes was being published. I cannot say enough good things about this. Sure the recipes sound frou frou and may make you start buying red wine vinegar on a regular basis but aside from a few, they are really not difficult or that time consuming. Plus, it will force you to expand your food horizon and make you experience flavors you may not have tried previously. This has truly transformed how we eat and drink wine. We actually have trouble spending gobs of money at high-end restaurants now because we know we can make just as good (and usually better) meals for 1/4 - 1/3 of the price! I've already recommended this book to all of my friends who I knew would appreciate it, so go on, be adventurous and try something exciting! You truly will be amazed."
2,"Complex Recipes Requiring Too Many, Specialty Ingredients","The recipes require too many ingredients (over 40 per recipe in some cases; average > 20) and ingredients that are difficult to find in typical stores (such as achiote paste, preserved lemons, etc). The recipes take a long time to prepare and have not once been worth the effort to shop for or to prepare."
4,Best wine to food match cookbook yet!,"I bought this cookbook for a friend and now I'm back to get my own copy. It is clear, concise, well-organized and beautifully photographed. Sid Goldstein gives food matches and food no-nos for each varietal and follows with some mouth watering recipes to match each wine. If you love wine and food in delectable combinations; don't miss this one! Bill Rogers Colorado"
3,Firm Red Flesh and Delicate Smokey Flavor,"I am rating this three stars although I wish I could give it 2.5. The fish itself is very good sockeye with a nice red color and firm flesh. However, the smoke on this fish is so delicate it nears bland. The smokey flavor is there but you have to strain to taste it. What is unfortunate about this fact is that sockeye should have a rich distinct flavor. Instead, the smoke robs the flesh of its richness and doesn't really give you much in return. The net result is something nearer salmon jerkey rather than smoked sockeye. The overall effect is OK, but my initial reaction was ""what have they done to this fish!""Edit: Sockeye has a high fat content and as a consequnce you should avoid if on a diet."
1,Not worth it!,I bought it as a gift for my family. But it turned out making everybody disappointed. The fish looked pale and tasted odd. Also it fell apart so easily that we finally could only eat it with lots of thousand island dressings. Don't even try it.
3,Small portion,"I expected a larger portion when I ordered this. It was very tasty, but I expected a little more of it is all."
3,Alaska Smokehouse Smoked Salmon,The box of salmon arrived but on the box it does not state that the salmon is sockeye. This concerns me since the description says sockeye fillet. I think the box should state that it is sockeye salmon.
3,Missing link,"I liked this and it was working well for a while, but then my dog decided he wasn't into the taste and stopped eating his food when I put it over it. Had to stop using."
5,Unbelievable benefit,"My kitty has re-occuring anal glan problems. I give this to her, and in two weeks it's gone !!!! Ho-Raaaay"
2,Was ok At first,"My dogs loved this, however once we got half way though the bag they ended up with loose stool whenever they had Missing Link. I used half the recommended dose."
2,Must be a rocket scientist to construct!,"This toy had it's appeal! I thought for sure that my five year old daughter would love this toy. Christmas day, with her sister, she opens the container and they have at it. Thirty minutes later my five year old is fed up, my 9 year old is confused, and as a parent, I am left scratching my head! You can make very basic gear configurations, that move, on the boards that are provided. But in order to make some of the more complex ones that are pictured online and on the container, I am afraid that it would take a little more than imagination. They need to include better instructions!! Sitting there with them, I felt confused and gipped! It could be fun - but know this going in...."
2,Mission Impossible,"They say for 3 year old and up ? how about me 30 year old and don't know where to start, The instruction very very short, no picture, no 1 2 3 step, no sample model,no where to start. They just give you many letter about basic of building base, gear, light, no photo. With 20 kinds of gears , flips, lights, you have to figure it out yourself. The toy have 121 pieces, with over 100 step to build I guess ,without photo instruction, they are nothing but a looser. Need too much time but still impossible. If you don't have time, forget it."
5,Great learning and imagination activity,"I purchased this toy for my 4 and 7 year old grandsons. They both played with it endlessly upon opening it,and then the parents and other grandparents joined in building gear structures. Who knew the adults would love it! Great family activity and really gets the imagination going in all ages."
5,Gears Lights And Action,Awesome toy! My 3 1/2yr. old son loves following the picture instructions and builds the whole thing himself (he loves puzzles). My husband and I couldn't wait till the kids went to bed the first day we got it just so that we could have a turn at building it. It is a lot of fun. I am sure we will have this toy around for years. Comes in a big bucket great for storage.
3,"light break very easily, otherwise fun toy",all kids and dad had fun...while i watched them play and be curious about what they could construct....light that flicker are fun but are like strobe lights...and the on off button broke off on all of them!!!!! def not worth the money spent!
3,gears spin around and around,"It's not really a toy to teach about gears. About all you can do is connect the base plates and chain gears together. They give you parts to make vertical elements but I didn't succeed in doing much. There are a few parts that came with no instructions and I can't figure out how to do much with them. They have a few parts to make different ratios but again, you can't do very much. I wish there were more instructions.It's a great toy if you have a little one who likes motors and spinny things - they can put the gears down and make them spin. Just don't expect to be able to teach anything about gears."
2,Poor design disappoints,"My 9-year-old son got this for Christmas. The simple stuff is easy to make using small gears lying flat. We tinkered together for a while to make some of the complex systems displayed on the box, but frankly, they are impossible to make. I believe another reviewer for a version of this toy said that it would require adults using superglue to hold pieces together to make the cool stuff. I agree. The pieces do not fit together in a predictable or stable way to allow gears to turn as you build a tower (well all but the simplest tower with the small gears). I'd build a tower only to have it not work, or have it fall apart because the gears would only mesh if the pieces were not firmly fit together. The brief instructions don't help. The instructions crucially lack drawings of sample set ups. My son gave up after 15 minutes and I did a half hour later."
2,Poppy and Depressing,The album starts off ok...but after a few tracks everything starts to sound the same. Butterglory sounds like the lemonheads with a touch of Yo La Tengo mixed in. The problem with this album is that it doesn't go anywhere. After the 4th or 5th track you're wanting to turn the cd off and put on anything to possibly wake you up.
5,Stories with Morals,A great gift for young children to read to them. Each story of several in the book has a moral.
4,Lincoln Douglas Debate,This is a great collection of strong opinions on the new LD topic about genetic engineering. We used it for cards and to get us acquainted with the whole shebang.
3,Interpol Meets QOTSA,"Dark, modern rock sound. Band has not yet realized its full potential on all the tracks. However, several tracks stand out immediately. ""Capitol"" being the most dominant. This song is so good it will lodge in your head for the next few days. Other standout tracks include ""A Theme"" and ""Writing on the Wall."" Good bet that this act puts on a solid live show."
1,Lenox Eternal Bath Sheet and Face Cloth,I rate this set very poor. In less than six months the face cloth has holes in it. The towel absorption is ok.
3,Ah Yes.......nice to see this again !!,"Seeing all these films when i was younger, i wanted to make sure i got them allyears later as most of them now are available on VHS or DVD.Took quite a while for Arabian Adventure to make it. But behold...here it is nowwith our favorite evil actor Christopher Lee, Peter Cushing..Mickey Rooney and more... Ok sure, this is not the best, but it is quite a important piece of these types of movies as only so many were made.So enjoy, the beautiful sets, the Arabian adventure feeling, the magic, the Genie the magic carpet and so much more.Great for kids...great for older ones also who are still kids in their hearts.A Keeper."
3,"Plenty of familiar faces, good special effects, evil Christopher Lee","Christopher Lee is upto his old evil tricks this time in the Middle East in the time of Ali Babba, Arabian Nights and the ilk. I enjoyed watching this film and have been waiting for years to see it so I was happy with its release on DVD. Made in the era of Star Wars it has some good special effects including the flying carpet sequences especially the grand finale when the good guys and bad guys get airborn.Many familiar faces: Lee, Cushing in a cameo, Mickey Rooney as a gibberish speaking crazy iron smith, and Milo O'Shea as a stoole pigeon for Lee.I recommend this as fantasy family viewing. My 2 kids really enjoyed this( they are 3 & 4). It is what it is an entry from Saturday Matinees of years gone by. Fun way to pass the time with the whole family."
3,30-Day Subliminal Smoking Program- hard to stay with.,"I was only able to stick with spending 20-40 minutes per day with this, for two weeks- BORING! If I had felt less of an urge to have a smoke...- it would have helped me stay with it, it didn't.Before you buy this- I suppose you need to make a commitment to stick with the whole 30-day program?"
2,It works,"I recently bought 3 items from this brand - Lumiscope. Actually this is the only item that works among them. Though I am kind of suspicious about it's inconsistent readings from time to time.I think Braun IRT452 is a much better product, which I bought one for my parents in China. During SARS epidemic it never failed and provided consistent readings."
4,It is a very good thermometer but the box case is missing,"I like very much the thermometer. It is easy to use, precise and lightweight.The only thing missing is a box case that is shown on the picture. It was not included. There was only fabric bag included.Overall, the product picture is misleading. The shape of the thermometer is slightly different vs that shown on the picture. I think they show a bit different modification."
2,Not accurate!,"I've tested this product against a Vicks oral digital 8-10 second thermometer, and the Lumiscope thermometer seems to be rather unreliable compared to oral thermometers, being off +/- 1-1.5 degrees F. I would spend a bit more for one of the ear thermometers by Braun."
2,Low Battery,I don't know if it works or not - I just received it and all I get on it is a low battery reading.
4,"Good Product, easy install, fits F150 too!","I ordered this unit from Amazon with Prime and it showed up in two days. Great pricing compared to local dealers and no tax/freight! I installed this unit myself and had no issues with installation. You definitely need to use the Shims to get the rails level/flush during installation. I used the pressure clips, which may have necessitated the use of the shims more so than had I mounted direct to the bed with sheet metal screws.Also, as my title notes. This DOES fit a Ford F150 too."
1,Waste of money,"While opening the cardboard wrapped around the bowls, they slipped and the red bowl landed on my hardwood floor, breaking into several pieces. I didn't even get to use it! After reading all the other reviews from people having problems with the red one, go for a different brand unless you only want the small 2. Even if you aren't as clumsy as me, it seems the red one cracks or breaks no matter what you do."
3,Too small,I wish the description would've said how big these bowls are b/c the biggest is barely big enough to mix a cake.
1,broken bowls upon arrival,"when the bowls arrived, they were broken. There was NO packing in the box with them. So much for that Christmas present as well as the aggravation of packing them and taking them to the post office."
5,The Greatest Bowls!,I love these bowls! I bought them about 8 months ago and since then have used them almost everyday. They are perfect for just about anything you need to do in your kitchen. They're sturdy and still look almost new even though I use my electric mixer with them a lot and always wash them in the dishwasher.I have several other mixing bowls but I might as well give them away because I only use these now.
5,love it,great overall for the kitchen. I gave these as gifts recently and they were warmly received. you can never have too many mixing bowls... there are always a few in the sink!
1,dont buy these!,the entire bottom of the big red bowl cracked out after 2 normal uses. have not yet used the other 2 bowls but i expect the same from them. looked at the return policy and it is not even worth returning unless you are a diehard for justice SO BE WARNED. would give them them no stars if possible.
5,My favorite!,"LOVE:The colorsThe spouts and little handle notchesThe feel and varying sizes are perfect for different needsRubbery grip on the bottom is superbEasy to clean- hand wash only, which leads to the only dislike...MILD DISLIKE:Not dishwasher safe. HOWEVER, part of what I love about them is the feel and material, and that's what you get with melamine. You just can't put melamine in the dishwasher. They are easy to hand wash though because, so it's a fair tradeoff.I would buy them again and again, they are my favorite bowl set ever."
4,Very Handy,These bowls are perfectly sized and have an extra grip to make carrying easier. Very steady on the countertop.
1,Broken,"Have been waiting for these bowls for over a week, and now they finally came, but with two out of three bowls broken. The package came with no protection, so these fragile bowls got broken of course!! Would not recommend it!"
5,Ten years and going strong,"I acquired these in 2000, when only white was available. I still enjoy them. Bread, cake, tipping over from kittens,moving, dropping. Although I was adamant about ""no plastic in my house""... these bowls changed me! Light, quiet, safe for a bad wrist,easy to store, easy to hold while mixing, soaking beans look very elegant in these bowls. White can stain, rub with baking soda.. poof! One of my best kitchen purchases. Still pleased. I wash them by hand.Just get them and enjoy!"
2,2 bowls already broken,"I bought this set last year. I must agree they are great while they last, one of them my son dropped on the tile floor and it totally cracked the other one cracked when I washed it.I still have the biggest red one and enjoy using it but I must admit I was quite disappointed how little the other two lasted."
2,GREAT but bad material?,"I have had this set for a little over a month. I LOVE them, they are VERY convenient, the spout is a GREAT touch, they store well, and clean up easily. The con is I dropped the large bowl as I was putting it away and it shattered. It only fell two feet. While the concept is great, I would suggest investing in a set made of thicker material."
2,Not sturdy AT ALL!!,"Slips and slides all over the place. You would think that the bottom would be non slip - nope. Only have 2 left, dropped one after 2 wks of purchase and shattered into pieces. Not something I would even consider purchasing again."
3,It is possible to break Melamine,"I'm not sure how I did it, but I did break the middle sized bowl. I dropped it on my linoleum floor. I thought these things were supposed to be indestructible. Guess not"
3,Trudeau Melamime Mixing Bowls Adequate--But Nothing to Write Home About,"The bowls are brightly colored, of average weight and are just that--average and adequate. I purchased them to replace an old favorite I'd dropped and broken from a set of melamine bowls purchased years ago from Williams-Sonoma--sadly, a style no longer available. I have really loved the Williams-Sonoma bowls and use them daily. The new Trudeau set is a lighter weight, the bowls are a bit smaller than expected, and the colors less subtle than they looked online--i.e., bright rather than the dark red I prefer. The price was also much lower than I'd paid in the past for the higher quality product. Bottom line, you get what you pay for!"
5,Great bowls,"I can't say anything wrong about these. Great colors, grip well to the countertop, and easy to wash. I think I'll buy more."
2,Nice bowls but one cracked,I use these bowls a lot... they are thick material and just the right size BUT the red bowl (the big one) cracked on the bottom soon after I got it. Now I can use it only for dry ingredients . Needs more attention to quality.
3,3 Stars for Inadequate Packing,Our first shipment came totally destroyed due to the lack of packing material. Amazon was very good about returning it and quickly sent another with much better packing that arrived timely without any issues.
4,Good Set!,"Non skid, handle, and a pour spout - what else could you ask for in a mixing bowl?So why only 4 stars?1. Non-microwavable - it's a pain having to melt butter in a separate container, then pour it into the mixing bowl.2. I know some reviews have said lids would be nice, and I agree. Maybe in Trudeau Melamine Mixing Bowls 2.0?But for straight mixing (no melting or storing), these are fantastic!"
5,My SIL loved them,"These bowls were just what she wanted and she loves them. would buy for a gift again, for sure. Thanks."
3,Trudeau Melamine Mixing Bowls.,"Good set of bowls, however I found the set to be slightly on the small side. Was hoping for something a bit larger. But they do the trick well and are easy to clean."
1,Defective bowls,"I was pleased to find these bowls and was delighted for two months. Unfortunately I have a problem with this set and feel obligated to warn buyers to avoid this item. I am most concerned as I cared for my red bowl very carefully. I bought it Nov. 15, 2009 and Friday, February 26, 2010, the bottom center developed a hole the size of a dime with plastic chipped out around it. I never used any sharp objects with this bowl, washed it by hand and used wooden spoons. Buyer beware!"
1,It came broken!,The three bowls came bubbled wrapped like crazy and the bottom bowl was still broken. I have to assume it was broken before it was even shipped because there was an awful lot of bubble wrap on there and the box was not damaged at all. I just returned them.
2,"Great bowls, very fragile","I really like these bowls except that they break really easily. I've gone through two sets in the last year, just by slight drops from about a foot to a cork floor. I bought them so I wouldn't have to worry about breaking glass bowls! Sadly, I'm not buying another set because of it. I think the melamine is just too thin."
2,"Cute, but cracked in dishwasher after 1 month","Every one of these bowls was in the trash after 1 month. I did not microwave them, just dishwasher. They all developed an S crack at the bottom. They were nice, but not worth it since they didn't last."
2,disappointed,"purchased these bowls about four months ago. they were great, looked good, very functional, used them weekly... until the bottom blew out of two of them during normal dishwashing (manual dishwashing, not dishwasher). I will not purchase trudeau products agaqin."
4,Great durable bowls,Definitely a great set of mixing bowls. I only wish they came in larger sizes as well. Very solid and easy to work with in the kitchen!
5,Finally!,"This will not be a long review.Finally. Are you people looking for something Psychopod, Acut Genius, or Brainbug-gy? This group of 9 tracks is truly inspired by the outlaws of hardcore acid trance. I only wish I could find more immediately, but then again, my head is still vibrating from these 9. I challenge anyone to put on a pair of earbuds, fill up their mp3 player with these 9 tracks and wander the streets alone at night with a head full of chinese methamphetamine and not agree - a long-awaited breath of skull crushing fresh aire from over there ... keep it up boys ..."
3,I think someone missed something---,"Did anybody notice that Van Dyke Parks did the music for this soundtrack? One listen and any stalwart fan will know right away. Perhaps he was trying to keep this a secret? Nevertheless, if you are a fan, you could probably get a copy of this for pennies. The shipping might cost more!!! The anthem, ""Sweethaven"" is my favorite."
4,Good cut of the series,"It's not obvious from the product page here on Amazon, but this is an edited version of the entire 26 episode series. It has been cut down to 2.5 hours for a movie experience. It is a good buy if you have already seen the entire series or don't want to spend the time which would be upwards of 9 hours if watched as 26 episodes. It gets the idea of the story, but of course, some good things are lost. Personally, I think GITS is too good not to see all of the details."
2,Different English voice cast from GitS:SAC.,"Just like GitS: The Laughing Man, it just sounds ""wrong"" with different actors. Kusanagi has no anguish, Batou has no menace, and Aramaki has no wisdom.And you can buy the ""Anime Legends"" full season collection of GitS:SAC 2nd Gig for less than $20 more. That makes GitS: Individual Eleven is a poor value in my book."
2,Lacking Somewhat in Detail....,"I should have read the box myself before buying this ""recut"". Had I not already seen the original, I might have a little trouble following what's going on. Entire episodes from the original full length storyline are explained away in a single scene or sentence.I guess that had to be done for times sake, but you do seem to loose much of the detail and nuance of the story. To me it feels 'rushed' to tell its story rather than letting the viewer develop along with the plot line.I'd much rather watch the originals."
2,WARNING - Recut from Original,"I guess this is the danger of not reading the box. I started to watch this 'recut' version and kept asking myself ""where is the scene where...happened"". It is much better to obtain the entire series than pay for the ""recut"". I am very disappointed and will be returning my unopened ""laughing man"" recut."
5,Eleven Clay Men,"This is the second season concentrated down to 2hrs. and 40 min. For those of you who don't have the time or inclination to go through the 7 DVD series here is a way to get the essentials in an intense and violent way. I have already viewed it several times and actually prefer this two-DVD set to the whole Second Gig. While a lot is left out if you never saw the original you wouldn't know it. It holds together as a lengthy movie and has a lot of action. My understanding is the English voice actors aren't the same but I couldn't tell it. It really does save time and is entertaining besides. [Ed. note: the original 660 minute ""Ghost in the Machine S.A.C. 2nd GIG"" of which this is edited from is well worth the viewing. ""The Individual Eleven"" puts a whole season into one great movie.]"
3,"Not bad, but you miss so much...","If you have never seen the origional episodes, then I would recommend this for you. But, if you have seen the origionals, this will dissapoint. There is just too much missing to make me enjoy this. I know it is difficult to cut an entire season down to a two-hour movie, but I suppose everyone will have something they miss when done in this fashion. If you are a casual fan, go for it, you will enjoy it. Just do yourself a favor and watch the full series after."
4,is a interesting book,"i m so interesting about the character of this book, i would like to share with ""you"". please analyse the character with me."
2,Felt like a Ben Stiller movie,"Holy crap - we get it already - you dislike Leibniz.I can appreciate satire - I love satire. But Candide is essentially a collection of horrific happenings each told as a separate joke ending in the exact same punch-line each time: ""blah, blah, blah - but I guess it can't be so bad since this is the greatest of all possible worlds.""This is really satire at its lowest point. I give it two stars only because the book is a classic (albeit undeserving of the title). I've never been so relieved to be done with a book as when I finished this one."
3,:),"I enjoyed this book, but it was irritating looking up the footnotes. They made it especially amusing and odd, but it definitely isn't my favorite."
1,Awful translation,"While Candide is a great book, this translation (the Dover Thrift Edition) has but one merit, and that is its low cost. Not only does the translator (anonymous) use archaic language to render in English a book that was written in modern French, but he misuses it. While one could make a case for using 'thou' when Voltaire used the informal 'tu', this translator uses it seemingly at random. He reverses the meaning of at least one line and skips several words for no apparent reason. If you want to read Candide, either find a better translation than this or read the original."
2,wonderful book bad translation,this is a terrible translation of a wonderful book. the original in french is a lively and funny book but this practically word for word translation makes the flowing writing in french look chunky and outdated in english. don't bother reading this version find another translation.
4,True Satire,"Much like a painting with its colors, many novels have elements that bring out the true nature of the story contained within. Satire is one element that does such a job. Voltaire attacked the social wrongs of the French society in the 18th century. The story is enjoyable, and does its job to prove Voltaire's social beliefs. This book is definately an 8, having stood the test of time to delight readers over mant generations. This book should be the standard by which all satire should be measured."
5,Easy to Read & Funny,"After readingDarwin's Dreams, which featured ""the best of all possible worlds,"" I decided to revisit some classics that I haven't read since high school or college.This was one of the few satires that geuinely made me laugh. Candide is taught by his teacher, Dr. Pangloss, that they live in the best of all possible worlds. Right away, this is put to the test when Candide is banished for loving Cunegonde, who is considered above his station. Not only do horrible things happen to Candide, but terrible events also happen to everyone he knows.What I found funny is how Candide seemed to bring it on himself; he makes one bad decision after another, to the point of being predictable. The ending is exactly a happy ending, but Candide finally finds a place in the world that doesn't bring on more problems.I think this is a great book to entice young minds to read classic literature."
3,plain old cat toys,"well, not much to say about'em, except they were way too expensive, i paid like 9 dollars for shipping, so i ended up paying 15 bucks for some pefectly normal cat toys!!!! my own fault for not checking the shipping rate i guess...."
1,Don't hold,Bought these to hold wires up in our boat. They last about a day and then fall off. The adhesive is worthless.
4,Come on...deliver the Delivery Boys!,"I loved this 1984 comedy and could hardly wait when an announcement was made that it would be released on DVD last year (6/11/2007). Unfortunately it wasn't and I can't find out exactly why!I've made a DVD copy (for my own personal use, of course) from my original VHS tape but the quality is not the best."
5,A Superb Biography,"This is one of the best biographies I've read -- a fast paced, thorough, and fair look at a key member of the Johnson administration and a pivotal person in the mid-20th Century. It is simply astounding that one man had such a major hidden role in a presidential administration."
4,Too Much Culture,"Fun, fast, loud, creative, and punky, Cornershop tosses tape loops and traditional Indian-subcontinent instruments on top of the formula guitar/bass/drums but doesn't stray far enough to become unrecognizable. Straightforward lyrics about living between cultures rise above the mix and maintain a sense of humor even at their angriest."
2,A sketchy outline of what was to come,"For anyone who has heard Cornershop's last two albums ""Woman's Gotta Have It"" and ""When I Was Born For The 7th Time"", hearing their first album may be something of a disappointment. The band had yet to add the pop and dub influences that pervade much of the last two records and some of the songs are downright unlistenable. Although the East Indian influence is detectable, Cornershop was, by and large, a rough, lo-fi indie band at the time. The first album may be difficult for anyone but the hardcore Cornershop fan to like."
3,Somewhat less than expected.,Preservation Hall Jazz Band New Orleans - Vol I CD.The Band did an excellant job on some of the tunes but a few were better left off the disc.
5,Excellent Product,This light works great for illuminating a painting that is hanging in an area that is not accessible to electricity. Has a soft white light that clearly highlights a large oil painting. Looks good and batteries last a long time between changes. Would highly recommend this product.
2,not worth it,"4 of the 12 songs on this disc are his greatest hits. the others are good productions, but not what a greatest hits collection should include.... I wanted the songs I grew up with. I got 4 of them."
2,Wonderful music...but,"The songs are great but the sound is so flat. No highs, no lows, no dynamics - could have been a keeper."
1,"Short lived, not worth it","Realizing that this type of monitor is not real accurate, I used it probably about 40 times to establish a base line to compare with occasional readings later to spot trends. It worked fine during the baseline period (about 3 months) and I have used it 3-4 times a year since then. I went to do a check recently and although the unit seemed to function perfectly, the display is missing so many segments that the readings are undecipherable. Fresh batteries make no difference. This item was never dropped, treated with great care and always stored in it's protective case in my office at home. It never got wet, I never left it in a hot car etc. I'm gonna try an Omron next..."
3,"Very disorganized, careless, but not useless","This book started with incredibly many typos (and some errors). A lot of important details that I was looking for was just not explained. The author might have tried, but didn't spend enough time to make it crystal-clear. It was really amazing how some chapters have so little written, but were appended with a lot more pages of unexplained kernel (C language) header. A lot of the other material seem to be simply cut and paste from other sources.I did learn a bit from this book after reading it through, out of desperation - without another Linux Kernel book in my hand. I still don't feel I understand what I was expecting from this book. I don't think it is worth the listed price. I think it is worth $... Not to say, a lot of the material is already out-dated, even for the 2.3 kernel."
1,Unedited garbage,"This book was not edited. I believe they folded up the second draft and mailed it to bookstores. The author is also a very poor writer. Portions of the text remind me of the ""All your base are belong to us"" funnies or similar jokes about bad translations. I recommend that no one buy it; that the author be vigorously slapped with a large wet fish; and that the publishers and editors be exiled to some land without books or paper.This is the worst technical book I have EVER purchased."
2,a scratch on the surface,"This book is not a good reference for kernel internals in Linux. It has a very superficial treatment of the majority of topics. If you're expecting to use this book like the famous UNIX ""Magic Garden"", forget it. This book does not have any depth."
3,Not the best for advanced,"This is a good workout, don't get me wrong. But it's not that great for advanced exercises who want a REAL workout. I don't even think I broke a sweat. But the band work is good."
1,Will not,"For the life of them, these shears cannot make a single clean or proper cut.There has to be something wrong with the design, built or material.How many times can I keep going over the same batch of hair HOPING it will cut?The one I got is worthless and even at .01 cent, they would not justify the price."
2,Simco thinner,"I taught this thinner is made in Japan as expected. It was advertise as Japan made but when I received it, found out it is made in Pakistan"
1,DON'T CUT,"I bought these to cut my toddlers fine hair. These scissors are so dull they just fold the hair maybe cutting only one or two hairs. Waste of money, and you'll have to pay for the return shipping."
5,hair thinner,my hair grows unevenly so a thinner really helps. This one is better than the one I lost. Thank you.
2,"Not made well; frame distorted, spinner unbalanced.",This product is not very good; it is not made well. The spinner doesn't fit in the frame well and it is not balanced. This causes it to wobble pretty badly so it is almost impossible to really do much with it. I wouldn't pay half as much for another one.
3,"Not bad, but not what you remember","This toy is attempting to be a replica of the gyroscope just about everyone had as a kid. it's not a bad copy, but it's not nearly as nice as the original. Mine, for example, is decidedly unbalanced and wobbles quite a bit, which limits the top speed you can get via the string.So it's a decent throwback, but if you're looking for the authentic experience, buy a used one off of ebay; these simply don't compare."
1,AWFUL!,"This product is useless, horrible, awful. Looks really bad and does not perform as a gyroscope. Spins only for 15 seconds, no balance at all! Buy something else!"
1,Shoddy copy of original toy!,"I LOVED the gyroscope given to me in the 1950's - sturdy, hypnotic, hours and hours of fascinating play. I bought the Tedco version recently to share with my grandchildren: Metal surfaces rough to the touch, lightweight compared to original product of my childhood, metal frame BROKE the first day of simple use! Disappointing to say the least! I am searching the web for vintage gyroscopes - I highly recommend that you not waste your money on this product!"
2,Mine didn't last very long,"This toy was great fun, and magically educational, but it wore out after 25 or so spins. The small pins that hold the gyroscope in place are made of a very soft metal that wore down quite quickly due to the tremendous friction incurred. Ignore the other users comment on it looking broken. It is supposed to look that way."
2,buy a different gyroscope !!!,"I have seen a similar model of a gyroscope a long time ago, which has prompted me to buy it now for my son. The quality of this toy is horrible. Metal is not polished before coating and is full of small bumps, the circle holding the gyro is not even closed - it has got a gap with two sharp ends on both sides.DO NOT BUY IT, GET A BETTER ONE!"
5,Better than a top,"Nicely crafted metal gyroscope. It is fun to play with and the spinning just seems to go on forever. To me, it is better than a top. Good fun and low price too."
5,gyrating gyro,"In this world of too many computer games, it is nice to go back to the basics. Lots of fun. Every kid should own one of these. Fast shipping. No problems."
1,parts didn't fit together,"I remember buying one of these for my kids in the 70s. It was larger and sturdier than this one I got for my grands. Worse, this wouldn't even go together. The inner gyro axis was manufactured too short to reach the intended insets in the outer frame."
2,Poorly made ... outside cage not even welded together....,No structural integrity ... consequently does not work very well. Very disappointing. We'll need to buy a better example in order to show our 5 year old the wonders of gyroscopic force.
2,Gospo Mixx,I bought the DVD for the very last song. The DVD cuts off in the middle of the last song and starts showing the credits.
1,Not worth it,"This light is not worth buying. It uses 2 D Batteries, which don't last long at all, and the nature of the light will not illuminate anything other than what it can directly shine on. Look for something else!"
3,Worth a watch,"Only if you're a Veronica Lake fan will you have any interest in this movie, which was her last. She has the lead role, and plays a scientist who experiments with maggots. For a DVD transfer, it was just awful. Smudges and particles litter the screen and the colors weren't that good. I was interested in seeing an old Veronica Lake, because I have heard rumors she became a big alcoholic and her looks faded and her teeth fell out. Those rumors were SOOOO exaggerated. She looked perfectly fine to me, and she DOES have her own teeth! This isn't one I would watch over and over, and I would suggest ONLY buying from a Marketplace Seller for a few bucks; not really worth $20, but if you're a Lake fan you'll want it. And no, it wasn't THAT bad like people say."
2,stand up comedy brian,very bad and stale comedy. not at all engrossing. couldnt even watch the full episode.not a good experience. he needs to improve.
1,agree w/ john,I also love Dane Cook. This is NOT good. Lame. He seems to be trying to hard and the physical part is a bit much. Wanted to love it....
1,Not funny,Big Dane Cook fan. Pass on this. Trust me. That's all the review you need... this sentence required to make 'at least 20 words long' criteria. And it gave me more laughs than this video.
4,Previous reviwer is mistaken,"This guy doesnt know jack. First off, Soilwork, Inflames and D. Tranquility are not even American. Get your nations straight buddy. Secondly, it sounds nothing like Soilwork, Inflames and Dark Tranquility. While they do have an ""American sound,"" they have their own. THe guitar in ""Ex's and Oh's"" has a ""classic, metal/rock"" sound which is refreshing because many of these bands cant play."
3,seems a bit rushed,"a half hour cd. last time i checked cd's hold 80 minutes. atreyu still has their classic sound, though there are a couple songs that just don't belong with the rest. lyrics aren't nearly as deep as suicide notes and butterfly kisses. song order isn't as good as it was on the promo version. overall a catchy and well designed album that you'll find yourself listening to over and over...because it's only 30 minutes long."
4,"Pretty Good, still lacks a little","Atreyu's third release is a SMALL STEP DOWN from the Curse, but overall these other reviews are somewhat pathetic. the songs do not sound the same, but it does somewhat sound like a rushed album. There are a few really cool solo's which considering that all the stupid radio bands don't have any talent Atreyu should be thanked for putting the effort forth to take time to write solos. ATREYU IS NOT A MAINSTREAM BAND as one reviewer posted. This album may not be as good as the Curse, but is still a lot better than all the mainstream crap played today."
3,Too Short,"I really like the music on this cd, but the cd is very short. I listened to the entire cd after buying it and running to the Post Office before returning home. I take away 2 stars just because of the length. I would download it and not spend the money on it. Best Buy after this week is charging $14 for it. That's a lot of money for a half hour cd. The music is awesome though."
2,These guys are done,"So what is Atreyu? These dudes are like hardcore one song and 3 doors down the next. I hope this isnt where this genre is going. Some if these tracks are ok. Totally not for somebody lookin for a ""break sh#t"" album. Like everyone is sayin, not as good as the other albums with butterfly kisses being the best. These dudes got softer and softer. Ill give em 2 months before theyre on TRL and eatin up the pop rock scene. Its sad but true."
1,Uhhh...,"Ok first of all this album is complete garbage. Second of all Suicide Notes is hands down their best album, not The Curse. The Curse was ok, but I knew that their next album was going to be horrible, and thus we have Deathgrip. The only reason I bought this album was because I hoped that Atreyu would have stopped the pop metal they did on The Curse and go back to real metalcore. But... they didn't. Atreyu started going downhill the day that ""Ain't Love Grand"" became popular."
1,"Absolutley Awful, Biggest Dissapointment of the Year","Suicide Notes and Butterfly Kisses was great, The Curse was awesome, A Deathgrip on Yesterday however is ne of the most dissapointing and horrible releases of this year. How can a newer band who was doing everything so right, go so wrong. This is a perfect example of what fame can do to a band. This release holds no substance whatsoever, the lack of creativity makes this release a very boring 30 minutes, and the lack of guitar solos shows that this band wants to conform to the ""no-solo's"" popularuty of today. Atreyu is done."
2,Dissapointing,"First of all, anybody who is a die hard Atreyu Fan will not like this album. It is very short and I feel as though they half-assed it. It kind of sounds like they just went into the studio and cranked out an album for some quick cash. Obviously Atreyu is not known for having ""long"" albums, but 9 tracks that are all pretty short is way worse than other two albums. They did stay true to thier sound and I suppose that some people who are just now starting to listen to them will like it, but the songs just aren't as well done as the songs on the Curse or Suicide Notes and Butterfly Kisses. On a final note, the guy that said that this was ""the best Atreyu album ever"" has obviously not listened to the other albums.-""Hatred isn't a waste of emotion if it forces you to better yourself""-"
4,A branch outside the keyholed image,"The album, while not an exact copy of either Suicide Notes or the Curse, showcases the talents of Atreyu. While not all will be happy with the lyrics (to which i say, you write 32 songs and see if you can keep up a worthwhile style) the band really does well with other forms of metal, staying with the screaming, but branching out more. The guitar remains amazing, and the songs have a few catchy lines. Overall a good album."
3,not bad,"Deathgrip is not bad, but I really think that ""the Curse"" is a masterpiece...I was hoping that the dark vampire theme would carry on and this album would be even better. Well, this is not what happened with this cd.It is not bad, I have been blasting it in the car for the last couple weeks, but it is not on the same level as ""the Curse"".I am left a bit empty....no spooky and deep chilling ""interlude""type track, and nothing close to ""right side of the bed"".In closing....I just started listening to this disc again now, months later (November 2006)...wow, it is really better than I thought when I wrote this review. But still much too short of an album. I am ready for the next disc!"
4,Not too bad,"i think its an ok cd, not as lyrically good as the curse but i like the more straight rock feel...And the the guy who said something about from autumn to ashes, maybe you should open your ears to the whining they produce, or maybe if they got any play you would notice they [...], and atreyu owns them, and as i lay dying owns them as well"
4,album worthy b-sides,"This review will not offer any off-beat wit or blabbering like some other cd reviews i've happened to read. I will say that the songs on this cd are very good, especially the first 4. If you like ""slow note"" and tha Chunk, then pick it up."
3,So-so,"This is not quite what I expected. Struik is a South African publisher, and South African tree books rank among the finest in the world. This one does not, although the printing quality is fine, and the quality of the photographs looks pretty good too. However, these pictures are printed quite a bit too small to do them justice. A bit less space devoted to typography and more space for pictures would have helped a great deal.Another thing that detracts form the book is the ""common trees and shrubs"" which turn out to be the trees and shrubs commonly encountered, including exotics that are planted the world over. Also, the book is not free of typo's and other errors. This is not a terrible book and perhaps even value for money, but hardly what one would expect from a publisher with this background."
1,Terrible field guide.,"This is one of the worst field guides I have ever seen. It includes too many garden exotics, has no key, and is not organized taxonomically. Photographs not at all useful for identifying trees. Only very rarely can you use the guide to definitively identify something."
3,What's on it,"Bad Neighbors: Homesteader Frank Stewart has been shot ?sparking a feud between the ranchers and farmers.Strangers: Lanny Gaines and his ailing father moved to Paradise Valley months ago and are dismayed that no one from town has come to introduce themselves. When outlaws, posing as surveyors, seek shelter at their home, Mr. Gaines is so desperate for company that he is happy to oblige.The Outlaw's Girl: Young and naive Thelma has fallen in love. The problem is that her beau is none other than the vicious gangster 'Chic' Dillon. Dale must talk some sense into her before she ends up in jail - or worse.The Desert Fugitive: When his twin brother is found shot to death, Bill Harris enlists the aid of Roy to find the killer."
3,"A bit too snug, Size is a bit misleading","I got this for my 15 inch mac book pro. I like the look and feel of the sleeve a lot, and it is very well constructed. However, I think the size mentioned is a bit misleading. it is a bit too snug for my laptop. It is a quarter inch too small in my opinion."
1,Bad Play turned into Worse Movie,"This movie started out as a play, which is rather obvious, given that it entirely takes place in one location/set: a bar where the stand-ins hang out. This movie is truly terrible. It just doesn't hold your attention and barely makes sense. I love period pieces, old Hollywood glamor, and I have actually worked as a Stand-in. None of that could save this truly abysmal piece. All of the characters are ridiculous and uninteresting. The small slivers of historical fact only serve to make you wish the story focused on any of them, rather than these ridiculous women. What's with the distracting, inaccurate, and stupid accents anyway? Save your time and money and rent something else."
2,Great until it breaks,"I had this machine for 2 years. For the first year it worked terrifically, having accuracy even the doctors were amazed at. Shortly after having it for one year, the machine broke down. Sent it to Lumiscope for repair but since it was a few months out of warranty had to pay for the repair. Think it was $20. The machine worked for a few months thereafter and then again broke. Sent it a second time to Lumiscope; again a repair charge. About 6 months later, it finally gave out and I threw it out. So the machine which cost me originally $79 plus some $40 for repair, actually cost almost $120 for less than two years of usage."
4,Great cd!,"I used to listen to this album all the time when I was in the Army.Been looking for a remastered version for years,but it just is not available.At $6.99 I decided to go for this analog version.Glad I did,'cause this cd sounds great.I guess this music was recorded and played so well the first time,nobody sees the need for a digital remastering.Great singing,great easy listening songs!Worth all $6.99 (plus shipping) ha ha:)"
3,All the illustrations are missing,"If you're interested in the history of fashion this title is worth reading, but it would have a lot more value as a reference if the illustrations had been included when it was ""Kindle-ized""."
5,Words fail me,"Lambchop is simply amazing. I'll let the other reviews do the talking and just say this: Listening to Lambchop is like finding the perfect denim jacket at a thrift store - ragged, comfortable and solid - and then, when you wear it the first time, finding a hundred dollar bill in the pocket. And maybe some Dutch clown porn.If you don't love Lambchop, you will be left behind after the apocalypse."
2,Flawed DVD Playback,"Picture looked great via HDMI, but unfortunately there was a major problem during DVD movie playback. DVD movies would frequently stutter at chapter changes. This was a show stopper for me and I returned it. Perhaps my issue was specific to my setup (HDMI), a defective unit, or something else. However, I went and got the Panasonic single disk HDMI player (S52?) and all is well (except no 6 disc changer). Onkyo tech support was not much help either (They basically told me to return it). Save yourself the return shipping costs and buy the Panasonic player."
4,Very good to excellent rating.,This HDMI player is very easy to set up and produces excellent picture and sound quality. For the money it is a very good buy.
1,Great convenience... when it worked. Infuriating inconvenience now,"Had planned to build an Onkyo branded complete A/V system around this changer. Those plans, and the money Onkyo might have gotten from me, are now in question. The same errors that the other 1 star posters have had are exactly what I've experienced. Bad Disk, skipping, not recognizing a disk is present, freezing, etc. Additionally, like the other posters, this started randomly and infrequently and has progressively gotten worse. It's now a paper weight and with the price of electronics I'm debating on getting it fixed (likely more than a new player). Onkyo should be contacting it's customers and replacing these defective players. Don't be fooled by a positive review. They may have just received their changer. It will get worse for them in time."
4,"Excellent DVD Changer, upconvert is crisp and bright","The only reason I did not give this product a five is because i did not like the remote. Hover seeing as everyone uses their own remote these days i think it is a wonderful player. I also enjoy the ability to have multiple CD's in the DVD drive so i don't have to change out CD's when grown up are watching or children are, i just change to number on the disk."
1,I hate my DV-CP704,"I have had mine for about two years and at first it was okay. Then it started rejecting DVDs, saying that they were bad discs, but those same discs played just fine in my cheaper Sanyo player. At first it was only about 1 in 10 DVDs that were rejected but now it is more than half that it refuses to play. Even brand new, straight out of the box DVDs frequently are rejected.I can't get through on their help line to ask anyone if there is a fix for this problem. I did notice that there are other Onkyo technicians on the internet that will help but they wanted me to pay 45 bucks for their help. I said, 'no thanks'. It makes me wonder how dependable Onkyo products are if other companies can make a living by fixing them.I'm taking mine to the pawn shop and swapping it for a Sanyo."
1,Piece of junk,"I bought this DVD player from Amazon in 2007 as a backup to a 2 year old Oppo upconverting model. The Onkyo no longer loads DVDs, so now it has become a large, cumbersome CD carousel. Onkyo's response? Find a service location.I have an Onkyo amp/receiver that I love with a passion, but I will never buy any more optical products from Onkyo. This DVD player is worthless. BTW, my 5+yr old Oppo is still plugging along."
3,Sheds!!,"This wig is ""ok"". It is cute when you wear it with the actual Ariel mermaid costume. The wig doesnt stay on the childs head well. It is a cheap made wig, with terrible fake hair that turns into one big knot! It ""sheds"" a lot too.If you really want an ariel wig, give it a try, its not the worst either.I had to put a ponytail holder on it to keep it out of my daughters face...it's a bit wild!!"
2,Wild Hibiscus Flowers in Syrup,"Disappointing. I went to a lot of trouble to buy these, as I thought it would be impressive and novel for guests when drinking champagne at Christmas. No-one had any useful comments to make, some left half of the champagne and the flowers, although encouraged to eat them.It was a waste of money and champagne should not be interfered with, maybe better in lemonade!"
3,Diversificating Nation,"Early Dame Edna takes her UK-born Australian nephew back to England to merry on a local girl of whose mother arranged this trip on her expense.Showing the England of the seventies as seen by an Australian-bread lad and lad's behavioral features as seen by local Pomes distinguishes traditionally between Australia and mother country of England by usual made-in-Australia way.Perhaps, Crocodile Dundee in the States ( see, for instance,The Crocodile Dundee Triple Feature)is the further much better developments of this topic on one nation's diversification upon a passage of time occurred."
3,"Quality looks good, but cuff is way too small","The size limitation is not listed on the Amazon site, but according to the Lumiscope help line this model is limited to arm circumferences 12.5"" or less. That's too small for an adult male with average musculature. I'm no muscle-man but my arm is 13"" around the biceps, and the cuff was not even close to big enough. I had to return mine to Amazon."
4,Good product for the cost!,"This is a good quality product for at home use. Requires some assembly, but thats no trouble. Overall, its exactly what we needed!"
4,not bad,"Easy to use, as long as you've had a lesson from your doctor. Packing it back up is a bit of a pain, but otherwise, well worth the money"
4,good for PRO's.,if you are a buying this then you are a professional or close to that and know exactly what to expect from this aparatus.Newbies- try this one Omron HEM-432C instead.
1,Very Disappointing for our family,"I read this book aloud to my 3 oldest children (13,11,8 yo).To be fair, it had some good qualities:It was funny in some places, although usually just to ME; Most of the humor went right over the heads of my children who were in the intended age range! It did have a likeable main character, and a likeable secondary character (the ""Gawgon"".)But these qualities were not enough to redeem this book. The eccentric relatives were apparently added for comedic effect or possibly to lengthen a rather short book. But they were just WEIRD to us and left us wondering why they were even mentioned... to torment us? Yuck. We'd rather have more interaction between the main characters.For some reason, few paragraphs were more than a sentence or two long. You just don't appreciate a well-organized paragraph until you read through an entire book without them.My kids like almost anything I read to them. They were glad when this one was over (SO WAS I.)"
4,This book was wonderfuly silly!,"The Gawgon and The Boy was a good book with strong characters. The book was a 1 day read for me. Lots of kids will enjoy all of the silly nicknames the main character has given, and they will be sure to recomend it to all there friends!"
3,A Tutor?! No Way! !,"David (also known as The Boy, laddie-buck, blighter, and Bax) thinks that getting out of school is the best thing that could happen to him after he nearly dies. That is, until his parents decide he is going to have a tutor instead. This fact is made even worst when they decide that Aunt Anne will teach him. She doesn't need a salary, which is good since it's during the Depression, and she needs something to do. David dreads his first day until he realizes that it's actually the best thing that could have ever happened.I think this is a good book for anyone eight or older to read."
4,Victoria Magazine Country STyle,"This book was in GREAT shape, shipped fast and a good addition to my collection of Victoria Magazine Books. I have my old magazines because they had such a nice magazine."
3,There's a better book!,I wasn't happy with this book. The pictures weren't of true original English country style they were of houses that used sparse furnishings and didn't tell or show you how to decorate in this way. If you want two exceptional books on English Cottage decorating buy The Country Diary Book of English Country Style and also The English Country Cottage. The pictures are wonderful showing how to decorate and the written paragraph explains why you decorate that way.
2,Not particularly useful,"Book broken into sections: Hearth, Sheds, Outdoor, Living, etc. Limited usefulness"
3,Living Your Dream,"If you want to live your dream, this book will point you in the right direction. Look forward to surprises in Finding Our Way. This is no ordinary travel book. Jayne and Mike's journey will challenge you to take a closer look at life. This book will take you to unexpected and unexplored places in both the outer world and your inner self where new discoveries are not only possible, but are likely to change the course of your life!"
4,A good overview of the early renaissance,"'Foundations of Early Modern Europe, 1460 - 1559' is the first in a series. For me, it has the right level of detail and is readable (for a history). It provides an overview of the events at the start of the Renaissance. It puts the invention of the printing press in context with scientific thinking, and the explorations of Magellan, Colombus and others. It is thought provoking when you compare the revolution created by the printing press to the impact of the internet today. As a person who avoided history class in High School and College, I plan to read the remainder of the books in this series."
4,Disabled Village Children: A Guide for Community Health Workers,"Really like this book, it is full of useful information for parents, teachers, health care professionals etc. The book is well-layed out and I fully recommend it."
1,Do not waste your money!!,"I grabbed this on vhs (thank god) what a joke all the ""interviews"" are over the phone the footage is simply pitiful!! i have boots that would knock this crap out of the park the so called ""concert"" footage is so sickingly beyond believe that it makes one wonder if Winter himself ever had a hand in this,one part is, at best 4-5th gen bootleg footage, where is the Musikladen footage? where is Winters consideration for his fans??? Go to your nearest record show find some quality footage and leave this trash to the landfill"
1,"C'mon Johnny, your fans deserve better than this!",What a drag. I have been a hardcore fan of Johnny Winter for over 25 years. The man is a remarkable guitarist with a style all his own. The picture and sound quality on this disc are poor...even terrible at times. I've never been more disappointed with a concert DVD. Guess I'm not as hardcore as I thought.
1,Very Poor Quality DVD- A Real Pity,"I can't believe the terrible quality of this DVD. A terrible waste of all that DVD can offer. The first two cuts come off of the ""Johnny Winter Live"" vhs.The picture and sound quality of the vhs tape is great. I can't understand how it could have been butchered so badly by being put on DVD. The quality of the rest of the DVD is only slightly better, if at all. I am a huge J.W. fan, he deserves much better than this DVD offers."
1,Great bluesman -- bad DVD,"Sorry, but this DVD is a waste of money unless you want grainy clips with bad sound from old concerts. Winter is still one of the best bluesmen alive and it would be great if he could muster a concert DVD with better production values. This isn't it."
3,HIGH-TECH,"First of all I would like to say that I like JW very much! but this DVD is terrible! It's like a pirated VCD. When we speak of DVD, it comes to our mind of high-tech. In this DVD there's nothing high-tech. The songs which he performed by the way are all excellent, the quality of sound is fair and the quality of the picture is the worst I've ever seen.If you're a JW die hard fan, think twice before buying this DVD. I recommend that you buy his albums instead."
2,To Bad - He deserves better,"After viewing the DVD, and shaking off the feeling of being ripped off, I pulled out all the VHS material I've collect on Johnny. Sure enough, most of the material was there, minus the interviews of course, clean video and pretty decent sound. I can't say that about the DVD. Most of the material was copied from the VHS format, the better being ""Guitar Greats"", and they would have been better off using the tapes I have to copy from.If you're a true fan of the best blues guitar man alive, buy it. If you're looking for the video footage that you thought would be crisp and clear, and audio that would knock your socks off, you better wait till someone puts together something that this man deserves."
5,Some Details,"The songs ""Rock & Roll Hoochie Koo,"" Stranger,"" and ""Sweet Papa John"" are excellent and are from a 1984 concert video which I own. The whole video is 45 minute long and is a complete concert. ""Mad Dog,"" ""When You Got A Good Friend,"" ""Don't Take Advantage Of Me,"" and ""Mojo Boogie,"" are also well done. These are all from Johnny Winter's second comeback period. The last song is from Bob Dylan's 1993 birthday at Madison Square Garden. It is a wonderful performance of Johnny's signature tune "" Highway 61 Revisited."""
1,I Can't Be Good All the Time,"This book is the most horrific laothful book I've ever seen. I find myself a man of good humor (yes the review is from a man) but after going through this book I can nothing but feel sorry for Anne, the author. I am so sorry that life has left her so bitter and hollow that the cartoons might bring her comfort and/or humor. But maybe that is where life has gotten for both her and a lot of america's women.The last page sums it up ... ""alone at last"". From the bottom of my heart, I feel sorry for them all."
4,Hilarious!,"Very funny and clever. However, the binding fell apart in just a few days after I gave it as a gift to a friend. She still loves it, but she had to reglue it and is now very careful about how she opens it."
3,Clarification...this is not Peter Jefferies,"Just a quick point to clarify the other review here. Peter Jefferies is NOT part of The Cakekitchen. It's Graeme Jefferies. Anyway, a friend of mine gave me a whole lot of CDs of Peter and Graeme's music and I have to say that only a handful of songs really have stuck with me. For a devastatingly good Cakekitchen song, listen to Everything's Goimg to Work Out Just Fine. Nothing on this album resonates with me in quite the same way."
4,Really good one,"This bad is even more quality, as I expected. Massive and solid in hands, nice looking. The only problem that this is not real leather. This is something like a rubber leatherette, but very quality leatherette.So, as for price this stuff is good at all, but if will be cost more $30-40 - I will be not sure to buy it."
3,Review of Briefcase/bag,"The bag fits my needs and is overall pretty good. I can see that the strap may end up having a short life, since I carry about twenty pounds + in the bag regularly and the strap is thin and relatively flimsy. On the whole, though, I am satisfied with my purchase."
4,"Good, but has problems","When I first received this briefcase, I thought it was great. It looked professional and durable. However, one of the zippers does get stuck often. After using this for about two weeks, the shoulder strap broke and cannot be fixed. If you just want to carry it using the handles, then it is great. But beware of using the shoulder strap if you have a lot of paperwork in the briefcase!"
1,Don't Bother,Briefcase looks cheap and starts breaking almost immediately. Within the first week the lining started to separate from the inside. By the third month the shoulder strap broke. By the fifth month the handles were pulling off. Very disappointed.
1,Piece of junk,Had this bag a little over a year and always had problems with the zippers. Now it's at a point where 2 zippers have come off and the bag can no longer be used. I would strongly recommend not buying this piece of junk.
5,Exceptional Value,"This was the third purchase of this item, the other two wearing out because of many trips on business overseas. Its utility if high; its price is more than reasonable."
1,Broken strap on 3rd day,The 3rd day I carried this I was waiting for the elevator when he buckle on the strap broke and the bag crashed to the ground. Did not contain anything heavy like a laptop. I was disappointed with the appearance of the leather-like material which did look like leather to me. The strap is 1 inch wide and the grommet for attaching a key fob is very small and awkwardly placed. I struggled to attach a nail clipper on a key ring. Pockets are not well organized and all pockets on the side are the same depth - all the way to the bottom. The pen holden has one small zippered compartment so if you want to make a portable desk out of it you will have to use less items. I would not buy this product again and will probably try to shop for a new briefcase at a store where I can view the item person.
1,Bag did not last,This bag ripped at handle after 3 1/2 months of use. Nice roomy bag with sections which is nice but does not hold up.Handle ripped so can no longer use.
1,falls apart with heavy use,"After 2 months, I started getting tearing at some seams. After 3 to 4 months the 2 zippers were broken, it was torn and both of the straps had ripped out of the sides of the bag walls. The straps were only inserted in holes with some backing to keep them in and not really sewn properly. If you are wanting a bag for heavy use, get another one. What should i expect for the price? I expected more."
4,"Overall, great bag for the price but missing one key accessory.","All in all, I really like this bag. The many pocket options on the front are nice. A couple of the front zipper compartments hold a deeper pocket than you think based on the outline of the pocket. That was a nice surprise, when what looked like a relatively small pocket was revealed to go behind the pocket in front for a nice deep slot.It has virtually everything I would want...pen holders, checkbook holder, zipper pouch on the inside for coin, wallet, cell phone or whatever. Virtually everything. Virtually. The one item it is missing in my opinion is a key ring holder. Something that is tethered to the inside of the bag, with a quick release clasp that grabs your keys. My previous bag had that feature and it was one of the most impressive, yet simple, designs I have grown to love.All in all a great bag, and yes I can throw my keys in a zipper pouch, but I still prefer the easy access of a specific holder."
4,Great for the price,"Great bag for the price. I love all the pockets and compartments. The strap works fine in my opinion. It's not first class leather, but you can't expect that for the price. All in all a good purchase I say."
2,Good for the price,"If you are considering this bag, don't think you are getting a deal. It's very cheap, but it also looks and feels cheap. I bought mine for around $27 and I think it's worth just that. You get what you pay for."
1,Zippers are almost unusable,"I bought this bag as a replacement for a similar leather bag I had been using for years but whose lining had become torn. The bag looks good, and it has a reasonable amount of storage. The problem is the zippers appear to be very cheap and just won't work at times. I have had to pull so hard to get the zippers to work that I have bent one zipper pull and actually broken another. When I found the zippers difficult to use, I pulled the sides of the zipper together, to insure that the problem wasn't that I had overstuffed a compartment. This bag is so bad that I have gone back to using my previous bag, which has torn linings. My recommendation: DON'T BUY THIS BAG. It looks great for the price, but it's not worth it."
1,Bad Quality Hooks,Bag is good but the hooks used for bag is poor quality. Its broken. I can't use this bag any more.
3,Softl-Sided Briefcase,"Not quite what I expected, the two large pockets could use at least one more divider in them and two pockets are a little too large, but I've managed to make it work. But these cases are getting harder and harder to find; mostly all I came across were bags for laptops. It will do."
4,Good briefcase,"I like the design of the briefcase. It has enough different sized compartments that I can find a place for everything. As someone else has mentioned, the zippers occasionally stick making it difficult to retrieve items."
2,It was not large enough to replace my current bag,It performed as described. A wordy review is required to submit this rating. Everything after the 1st sentence is filler.
3,Good for the price,"The zippers, as many others have mentioned, aren't great. On mine, it seems to be the fabric around the zippers interfering with their operation, rather than the zip itself. It's a minor problem and the briefcase is still usable.While the briefcase has more than enough room to hold the laptop, mouse, cables, and two books that I frequently need to carry in it, the bag strap becomes uncomfortable to carry when it is this heavy.All in all, not a great product, but good and functional for the price."
4,My doctor liked it,"I don't own one now, but I did years back. It was the last BP monitor that I owned and I haven't had one for a few years since it broke after I'd had it for five years (cuff wore out and burst). Shame on me for not self monitoring for so long. I'm starting a drug regimen that might upset my BP control, so I need to start monitoring again, and I'm shopping for a new device.When I used this, I took it to my doctor's to check its accuracy every time I went and I always found it to be on the money. My internist at the time, an old guy, was fascinated by it. I'm surprised that so many people had problems with its accuracy. As for fit, I had the opposite problem--I have big hands and fingers and sometimes had to twist my finger around in the cuff to get it to agree to inflate with it adjusted all the way out. The only person I ran across that it wouldn't work for was my grandmother, who was ill, bedridden and emaciated."
1,Dangerously Inaccurate,"I had an excellent Omron finger BP moniter for 15 years, that was Always right on the mark at doctors offices. Sadly, they no longer make them, so I got the Lumiscope 1083N Finger Blood Pressure Monitor. I checked it out several times, and every time, it was literally 'dangerously' low in its readings. That could have really dangerous outcomes for anyone with high blood pressure. I hate that it turned out this way, as the finger BP way of taking your blood pressure is certainly the quickest and easiest way. I think I am in mourning for my Omron. Be Safe and Don't depend on the Lumiscope 1083N Finger Blood Pressure Monitor for accurate readings. You just won't get them, and that could even prove to be fatal to some."
2,Noisy and Inaccurate,"I received this unit on 6/29/2005 and submitted a return request on 6/30/2005. Here's why:(1) The unit beeps the whole time you are using it. This is somewhat annoying, especially if you are sitting at your desk at work and trying to check your blood pressure. I suspect you could open the case and cut the speaker wire, but that would void your warrantee.(2) Myself and three other people compared the results this unit gave with the results from two different units. This unit consistently read *much* lower for all of us than did the two other units. So I would be concerned that using the 1083N would tend to give you a false sense of security."
1,"Lousy accuracy, nice function","Any of these finger units are notoriously inaccurate. I've tried 2 including this one. I went back to a self inflating arm cuff unit. The accuracy STINKS and is very errattic. Anyone who tells you different has an agenda. Ask your doctor. Compare at your doctors. Whatever. Then add that experience with your own. When you do it 3 times and the reading is all over the place but your arm cuff is derad on, what's your conclusion?"
2,Easy to use but not accurate,This was given to me as a gift cause I have hypertension. And I have high blood pressure. I monitored myself with this a 1 1/2month and blood pressure was in great stable condition and I've kepted track and wrote down everyday my blood pressure to show my Nephrologist to see if this works. We tested this monitor at the Doctors office(it was way off) and when we used his it was more accurate.......he said its more accurate to monitor on your arm. He doesn't think using this is a good idea because I won't be able to get an accurate result. So I was a little bothered. Its easy to use and convenient but when it come's to my health I'd rather be on the safe side. So I have stopped using this.
1,"Cute, but it didn't work.",I had to return this machine because it gave inaccurate and nonrepeatable results.
1,"Review / Biography of Bendix, Deanna an author","I have ordered this review of ""Contemporary Authors - Biography"" on Amazon.com. However, it has been a great disapointment. I expected a lot more information for my fee. It was a small, one page blurb about the author/artist. I expected to enjoy reading something about the life of the person. It said very little. I am very disappointed."
5,Nano Skins w/armband and lanyard,"Great product, love all the different colors and lanyard is great for hands free playing."
3,Good skins; but bland colors,"Pros - Economical, good quality skinsCons - Bland colors (except for the Pink skin), Armband is uselessReceived the product from third-party seller within 5 business days. Good quality skins but the colors are bland (not at all like the picture). Except for the pink skin; all the others are bland. And the armband is totally useless - it's a thin strap with velcro; it's not ""designed"" for holding the iPod. So; don't factor the armand in your decision. Other than that; for the price that you pay ($15 including shipping); the product is worth it. The skins are good & even though it does not completely cover the screen or the click wheel; it will protect your ipod quite well. I give it only 3 stars because the colors are bland & the armband is not good."
5,Excellent,"Excellent product, excellent price, excellent speed of arrival (standard shipping...arrived in less than 4 days from the date of ordering until delivery)"
3,"Great Price, OK product","Pros- affordable price, lightweight, not bulky, protects the ""body"" of the iPodCons- Doesn't protect the click wheel or the screen"
4,Great for the Price,"These were great for the price and worked well enough. I did notice that if you are going to run with it, the sleeve will not keep your Ipod in and it will go flying out. So you really do have to use the arm band and turn it upside down on the band. But overall I was very happy, it did what it was suppose to do and besides not fitting perfect it did just fine."
2,Lighter color than expected,I found the coloring of what I received to be much lighter than displayed at Amazon.com. The quality is good - though the coloring on 3 or the five was bland and boring beyond belief.
5,Awesome Armband For Running,I read previous reviews and some were bad but most were good so I bought the product. I absolutely love the armband! It is great quality. I run everyday and use my armband and it has not weathered yet in the few months I've had it. The skins were also a bonus. Great colors and fun to change them out. My favorite is the glow in the dark since I also listen to my ipod at night in bed. It makes it super easy to locate without turning the lights back on.
4,"Great price, good buy","Fun colors, really nice armband strap. I bought these skins and armband specifically for running with. The colors are nice- the pink is the brightest and looks great. The nano fits perfectly and snug, but when I was running my ipod slipped out of the case. It took about 30 minutes of hard impact before that happened. I've come up with a solution and that is putting it upside down on my arm. For the price, I am very happy with what I bought...just had to find a way to make it work for me!"
3,It's a lot for a little,I have two minor complaints about this product: 1) The picture of the product leads you to believe that the cases are not see through but in fact they are very translucent. I have a hot pink iPod and no matter what skin I have on the hot pink is completely showing through. 2)The cut out for the hold button at the top is not lined up correctly and the case partially covers the sliding button.
4,The best flag you can buy,"Basically their are two different types of flag footbal flag belts, the ones where each individual flag comes off the belt by means of velcro and the ones in which the whole belt comes completely off the waist of the player when pulled. This is the latter and the one that I prefer because the flags don't ever get lost. I have had this product a few years and they are still in great shape. I would buy these again if I ever needed any more flags."
2,Three Words!,"Ow Ow Ow!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I hope these things are going to untwist, because they won't stay straight when you try and put them in your ears and OW!!!!!!!!!! They hurt! The Y tubing is made of thick flexible rubber and the eartips are hard plastic. I've got them set up to try and ""untwist"" them. Update: They are less twisted but the hard plastic material that the eartips are made of are painful to the ear!!"
5,Great deal,"I bought these for a studio prop, so not sure how well they function, but great price and look great on photos."
3,Macademia Flavored Hawaiian Guitar Jam,"This EP by the Squirrel Nut Zippers has a slightly more tropical flavor, produced by a heavy emphasis on Hawaiian Slack Key guitar. I suggest listning to it on cold days, while turning up your heat and dancing around your house in your bathing suit. It should produce a strong Island Vacation feel."
2,Caution,"Their usual fun preformance, but note this CD has only 4 songs for 10 min. Little Mother-in-Law, You Are My, Anything But Love , and Wash Jones."
5,"Alright, alright","I bought this CD while standing right next to Jimbo Mathus,the band leader of the Zippers. He's a really cool guy, and if you ever see him you'll be able to tell that he's got a mouth full of metal. I really like this album, which is just chock (is that how you spell it?) full of pleasant jazz. It's rarely heard in comparison with their newer stuff, but I'd say that although the group wasn't yet famous or anything, that doesn't change the fact that it's really great. I just wish there was more of it."
3,You might want to know...,"1. I would consider the ""white pique"" to be a waffle fabric, not pique.2. It says that you can hand wash if you remove the bottom insert, but it feels like the top part of the stacker is a piece of corrugated cardboard sewn between two pieces of fabric. I don't think it would hold up to a single washing.3. The picture for white pique shows a single tie in the center. Mine came with two ties on the outer edges.4. This works much better when you hang it from a closet rod or towel bar. If you try to hang it flat against a wall, the bottom is not level. The front and back are equal lengths of fabric and both sides are designed to spread out from the top in an ""A"" shape.I'm going to keep this because it was cheap and the only white diaper stacker I could find. I really wish I could hang it from the wall and wash it, though."
2,Cannot wash it due to the card board in it,"This works fine but cannot be washed due to the bottom made of cardboard. Also if you put too many diapers, it does not close well."
4,"Good, but picture misleading - is much shorter","This diaper stacker is a good product, but is smaller in length than the picture shows. Overall we are pleased but probably wouldn't buy again."
1,I bought 3 different products that day.,"This one is not for someone who has weakness in hands; I was unable to turn it on. The buttons sides, and I tried for awhile; then asked two others to try. One was able to get it on and off, but state it was not easy for him. This is not for someone with disabliities extending to arms and hands."
5,Best Swaddler Ever!,"I love this swaddling blanket. When my newborn was smaller, I was able to make the blanket into a triangle and do a traditional swaddle. Now that he is bigger, I follow the instructions printed right on the tag of the blanket and only turn down one corner to swaddle him. He is 6 weeks old now and still loves being swaddled and sleeps better when swaddled. The blanket is the perfect size and is great for winter months and for heavily air conditioned houses in the Summer months. I am getting ready to purchase one of their lighter weight blankets too to try them out. Love the generous sizing of this blanket, love the weight of it, love how soft it is and love that it is so damn stylish too!I love it so much, it is my new baby shower gift of choice!"
3,Not as nice as I expected for the price!,"I bought this blanket in the pink with brown mod circles It arrived in a nice package, and I thought it looked really good at that point. However, upon washing this blanket, it came out of the wash slightly pilled and not nearly as soft as it felt before washing. Its still a cute blanket and is a nice larger size for a receiving blanket, but I won't be buying another one..."
1,Bummed,"I was sucked in by all the good reviews about this product, but once I received it, I was so disappointed. I can't believe I spent $25 on a square piece of flannel! It would be far cheaper to pick out some pretty flannel from a cloth store and have the edges hemmed by a tailor or dry cleaners, for those of us who can't sew. The little ""how to swaddle"" diagram on the blanket is helpful for my husband, but doesn't justify the price."
3,Great ... For about a month,"I loved this blanket for about 5 weeks. It was the perfect swaddler! But after that point, my baby was just too big. She was 8 lbs at birth and about 10.5 lbs at 4 weeks. If you have a smaller baby, this is a great blanket. But for bigger babies, I love Aden and Anais. Much more effective for us."
3,Very thick and too big - not for newborns,"This blanket came highly recommended, but so far I've been unable to use. It's really too big to use for swaddling 0-3 months and it's a lot thicker than our other swaddling blankets so it doesn't stay as tight. When I've tried swaddling my child, the fabric just gets to be too much (due to the large size) and I end up taking her out of the swaddle and going back to other blankets. I think this might be ok for older babies, but then again, you might not be swaddling that long (since it is not recommended once babies can roll over)."
4,"Very cute, but quite stiff",This blanket is very cute and is a good size for a swaddling blanket. My only complaint is that it takes a LOT of washings to get soft. It starts out very stiff and that isn't ideal for swaddling. I actually prefer their muslin version of this for swaddling (which also takes a few washings to get soft).
5,This actually lives up to the hype!!!,"As an O.C.D. pregnant woman. I researched and researched and finally purchased four of these. Once i opened them i knew right away they were going to be amazing! The quality is far far better than the four packs you can buy for $14-20 at local stores. It is so easy to swaddle and actually holds. They look amazing. I love that the have sewn the ""Swaddle process"" on the blanket itself for my husband (when i have to run to the store). My absolute favorite thing about this (besides the amazing colors) are how big they are. They will last far longer than the swaddle sacs you can buy. Swaddle sacs are great but they can only be used until they are too big. These will last much longer. I am about to order 2 more. I decided instead of buying $160-300 crib bedding set for them that comes with nothing you can ACTUALLY use besides a crib sheet. That these would work better"
4,Swaddle Designs Ultimate Receiving Blanket,"This is excellent as a privacy throw when you are breast feeding in public, as well as doubling up as a play mat. I have five of them now and think they are great value for money."
1,BEWARE THE RIP-OFF / TERRIBLE SOUND!!!!!!!!!!!,"Wonder why there are 2 identical packages like this? This one was done cheaply in an attempt to mimmick the sound of records. I wish I could give this a negative 2! It's missing songs, it sounds like hell, and is a rip-off. You want a box with the first 8 Cd's buy the other one."
5,Buy every Don Camillo book you can find!,"I was about 12 when my father brought me home a copy of ""The Little World of Don Camillo"", and I couldn't put it down. Over the years I have searched high and low for more of these delightful stories (with varying success). They have the attraction of being interesting, humourous and heartwarming all at the same time, and have a great appeal for children and adults alike. They also show a real understanding of human nature and the human condition. Often when I feel a little low I pick up Don Camillo and cheer myself up again.The stories are set in a little village on the Po river in Italy soon after the end of World War II (note that some stories are set later than this, although most are set in this time period). They deal with the never-ending rivalry between the local parish priest, Don Camillo, and the communist Mayor, Peppone. I really can't recommend these stories highly enough."
4,Don Camillo,My mother was very pleased to receive this edition of the Don Camillo collection on Mother's Day. She is enjoying the stories she read years ago once again thanks to the availability of the many old and new publications through Amazon. Thank you.
4,"Charlie, the Lonesome Cougar","My grandson loves the Disney ""animal"" stories. He has worn out his VHS tape so I was glad to be able to find it on DVD."
3,Charlie,"I loved the movie and it's content. However, much to my dismay, I found out that approximately 15 minutes of the movie had beenedited. Some of these scenes were very important ones, whichwould have added greatly to the movie. I thought I was buying thewhole movie, not just a part of it."
5,Great Movie,When I watched this movie when I was young I loved it because I love cats. This movie was great when you just sit back and watch a family comedy movie along with great scenery. I just want people to love this movie with every fun part about it.
4,"Good movie, lousy print",The VHS I have of this is longer and has better color. I'm not sure what is missing but a few minutes are definitely gone. The print has faded to a blue or grey overcast which is a shame because much of the movie is shot outdoors in the Pacific Northwest amid some really beautiful scenery.This print really needs to be cleaned up and the missing footage restored.But it's still a great movie for kids.
4,I FOUND IT,I TRIED SEVERAL SITES BEFORE I FOUND THIS DVD HERE. IT WAS A NICE FAMILY MOVIE. MY WIFE HAS WANTED IT FOR AWILE AND I FOUNT IT HERE.
4,Pretty Ok! for Beginners that is,"Well, i dont have much to say about this book. if you want to learn java and xml and you dont have lot of experience with java, this book will give you a helping hand. however, if you do have a fair amount of experience, then this book will be a little too novice style esp. since it begins with an introduction to java language itself.So, in a nutshell, this book will supplement many online tutorial nicely and give you quick info on how to get your hands wet with xml. however, the information may not completely satisfy an experienced user (for that go for O'reilly's java and xml)"
2,OK,"All in all not that much stronger than the factory hitch as it relies strictly on the frame mounts and you give up the bumper mount. If you want a true hitch upgrade get the Reese TowBeast, you'll be much happier."

4,Atomic Jihad - something we should worry about!,"This DVD documents not only the threat, but it gives the particulars as to why it is a threat. The edicts of the Koran are covered in detail. These passages are those that are ignored or censored by the mainstream press who continue to call Islam a ""peaceful religion."" Historically and in recent times we see that it is anything but peaceful. The danger this country faces has not decreased, it is greater than before. The potential for a thermo-nuclear attack is great. The Islamic Jihadists are motivated to do this and as time goes by the potential for them to be supplied a weapon, particularly by Iran is increasing.The Islamic Jihad is focused on conquering the world and forcing submission to Islam. This has been and will continue to be their goal. Particular attention is focused on destroying Israel."
3,liviy,I dont cere much for this book. I also think this book could have ben beter. I think that if you made the book longer that would be betor. Becaus the rilly is does not sond like the end of the book. Or anthor way you could do it you could make a theered story. I would not rekamend this book.
1,Let's drug our children!,"Who wrote this book, Novartis? (The makers of Ritalin.) Let's teach our children to take drugs to curb their natural childish exuberance, I'm sure it will teach them to take drugs for every little problem all through their life. I'm sure the greedy psychologists and drug companies LOVE this book, as well as lazy teachers who would like for their students to sit through class like zombies and substandard parents who'd rather not work at parenting, but I'd hate to have the writing or promotion of this book on MY conscience."
4,A Very Good Book,"I like the book Joey Pigza Looses Control by Jack Gantos.It was a funny book,it was also a very good book.The reason I liked it, is because it has a little funny Chihuahua named Publo.One day Joey was playing darts and acidently peirced Publo's ear.Another reason I liked the book is because it has a lot of baseball.Writen by a 10 year old boy in AR."
1,Depressing,"I was very disappointed with this book. Joey leaves his mom for the summer to visit his alcoholic father and chain smoking grandmother. Joey requires medication to keep him from chewing his nails raw and breaking out in hives. Then the father decides his son doesn't need medication. His dog has problems too.Kids books are supposed to be fun, maybe a little scary or mysterious, or maybe fantasy. This one is just ... depressing.I'm not letting my pre-teens read this."
3,Joey Pigza Looses Control,"Joey Pigza Loses Control: reviewMy lit circle book, Joey Pigza loses Control was an easy and kind of short book. It has 196 pages. I would give this book a 6/10; it wasn't that interesting like people said it would be. The story is about a boy named Joey who goes to see his dad and he makes a bond with him along with his grandma. His dad and grandma both smoke. His mom told Joey before he went to go see his mom that his dad was kind of crazy. Joey's grandma uses an oxygen tank because she has leukemia, his dad where's nicotine patch but I don't know what that is. His dad soon lets Joey play baseball and Joey becomes happy. On the day Joey has to go back home with his mom he argues with his mom that she was wrong about his dad. This book was pretty weird but worth reading. You may want to even read this book a second time.By: Andrew"
3,Think about reading it.,"Joey Pigza is a kid who is on medicine for his hyperactivity. He meets his dad. His dad doesn't like the fact that he is on meds for his hyperactivity, so he flushes his meds down the toilet. After that day, Joey starts to lose control. Will Joey ever get back on his meds? Read this book to find out. This book is for anyone who wants a good laugh and loves a crazy story. It is a great story; I would read it over and over again."
5,a very exciting book,Well i think this book was a good book becouse it kept me entertained all throughout the book.I also think it was a good book becouse it relates to some kids real problems and feeling and it is also very funny and serious and the same time and that is why i think this book gets 5 stars
4,Joey Pigza loses control,"In this book Joey Pigza is on a vacation to his dad's house that he has never seen in years. He brought his dog with him, and he meets his grandma and Leezy, Joey's father's girlfriend. Once Carter, Joeys father, finds out that Joey has a powerful arm, he just might use him in his baseball team. The only problem is that Carter But will Joey go through all of this? Will he make it?"
1,joey pigza reveiw,joey pigza lit reviewMy lit circle book right now is not exciting because i don't like books but it doesn't make it a bad book to every one its just my opinion but i would still recommend this to anyone who likes reading . Also this book would be a good book for anyone who might have a.d.d Cause joey also has a.d.d so for anyone this would be a book to read to relate to it. I Would give this book a 0 if i could rate it cause it is kinda slow. . . . REALLY SLOW IN MY OPINION. This is a book for people who can sit still and read through a book.will
3,:0,I highly recommend this book. One because I'm sure a lot of kids can relate to Joey in one-way or another. Also I'd love to read another Joey Pigza book by Jack Gantos because Joey has such a great personality and is a funny character. Overall I really liked Joey Pigza Loses Control and would recommend it to anyone.
2,SOOOOOOO STUPID!!!,"I had to read this book in school. It was almost like beeing eaten by a band of killer roaches having to read it. It is a story about a boy who goes to see his father. He lives with his mother.His parents are divorced. He is a hyper-active kid who has no common sense whatsoever. His dad is an idiot. Plus he has a little dog that gets carsick and throws up everyware. I wouldn't think that any normal person would want to read about that. If you have to read this book run far, far, far away as fast as you can."
2,6th Grader's Review,"This story is about Joey Pigza before his medication (the medication is for ADD, and it is working for him). He is 9 years old and beyond hyper, and he is becoming quite dangerous with just his grandmother around. His mother is away chasing his dad who also can't control himself. Joey has many problems with his hyperness and must go to special ed. This story is filled with excitement and fun. Joey is unaware of himself and the people around him. This gives him quite a few problems. I would not like to meet him in a crazy stage.This book was very good, but some parts were a bit too crazy. I sometimes felt like it got a little too insane by Joey. The author tries to make things funny that are not intended to be funny. Overall it was a fairly good book, and I think people should read it.Reviewer: Douglas2 out of 5 stars"
5,My students loved it!!!,"Joey starts to realize he needs help, and his mother does it best! Carter just doesn't get it. He needs even more help!"
4,Joey Pigza Loses control,Joey Pigza Loses Control by Jack Gantos was a great book. This book was very funny because of all the dumb things they did in the story. You will have to read the story to find what they did. Joey's dad and grandma are very weird. They are not like your normal parents. This book makes you just want to keep reading and reading. It is excellent for kids of all ages.
5,Do you know what it's like to have ADHD?,"Well Joey Pigza does. Joey Pigza is the main charcter in Joey pigza loses control by Jack Gantos. His dad,mom and grdanma are other characters in this book. One of the two canflicts in this book Joey has to chose to live with his mom or dad. His dad has alcholoism. Another conflict is Joey has to stay on his medacation or off them. His medacation helps him with his ADHD. Read this book to find out what he decides to do. I recomond this book to people with ADHD and to people who know people with ADHD. I like this book because it's funny and tells how he is coping with this disorder. ADHD is Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder."
4,"He's wired, are you?","The second installment in the Joey pigza series i a great book for you to enjoy. it will make you laugh 'till the very end and give you such a vivid visualization, you'll wanna keep reading it over and over again. So I suggest that whatever you're reading now out that down and rush down to your local library or bookstore and get the book.The book is about Joey spending his summer vacation with his dad that he's only seen once. Joey soon finds out that his dad is just like him; hyper, has ADD (Attention Deficit Disorder), and has a hard time with his life. Spending time with his dad he learns how to play baseball, how his grandma and dad live, and how his dad is way worser than him. Although Joey wants his parents to get back together, it will not happen for his mom cannot deal with his dad.I give this book for stars because I liked it and it's one of the better books I read. So give it a try."
2,"Would work for a costume, maybe",Don't buy this for actual use expecting much. I bought it for obtaining sound effects for film and I was dissapointed with it's performance. I can barely even make out a partial heartbeat when using it on myself normally.
5,Best cd I've heard all year,"I caught these guys and gal in some backwoods bar in Birmigham a year or 2 back. One song after another just blew me away and this cd along with Seat Beneath captures the experinces w/o sounding watered down like most of the crap out there. Not too sure where they are now, but dammit if I don't find myself singing one of their tunes in my head almost every day!!"
4,Good Recording,"I really enjoy this recording of Puccini's second opera. The cast is very good, and Queler conducts the ochestra well. There is some beatiful music in this opera. It is'nt Puccini's most exciting opera but there are some musical moments that must not be passed by. Fidelia's aria at Edgars mach funeral for example is beautiful, Scotto sings beautifully here. Bergonzi is solid throuhout the whole opera, and also has a nice aria. The rest of the cast does a stellar job as well. If your a Puccini collector you must this opera to your collection"
2,Totally Useless,Outdated and useless. You are better advised to obtain one of Frommer's books on Berlin. I did not find anything of worth in this volume.
2,Grill It Vegetarian,"The first line of the book reads, ""Drain anchovies, reserving oil, and chop."" I would just like to point out that calling for fish in the first line is not starting out right for a book that claims to be vegetarian!"
1,avoid it,"Couldn't get it to work on my laptop (with Windows Me), then on my work computer (Win 2000 pro), it worked on win 98SE, but crashed frequently. Waste of money. Gonna return it."
1,"Nobody here needed support, YET.","I bought a QPS back in April, I had configuration issues right away.I followed the tech support format and emailed them. Giving them benefit of possibly being busy or email issues I emailed four times over four weeks from seperate servers. They do not respond through support.Now the hardware failed, I repeated the email attempts with no response and have phone support three times in two weeks to give up in Cue after 45 minutes. No 1-800 number.Now I have a very high phone Bill coming and a useless QPS device that I will eat also.Please don't allow companies like this to thrive, which they all too commonly do in todays market.Buy elsewhere."
3,What's on it,"Ghost Gulch: Jim Barton is missing ? leaving his wife to run their ranch. Neighbor Larry Ridgeway, offers to help by purchasing the ranch from her. Little does anyone know that Ridgeway kidnapped Jim so he could get the Barton land cheap.Shoot to Kill (a.k.a. Pat Brady Outlaw): Photographer Elmer Kirby starts a world of trouble for Pat when he convinces the sidekick to pose for a picture pretending to rob a stagecoach. Carl ?Alfalfa"" Switzer guest stars.High Stakes: Jerry Hill is the only eyewitness in the case against the Collins gang. After Jerry is ambushed, Roy must make sure he is kept safe until he can testify.Phantom Rustler: Rustlers are using trucks to steal cattle from the small-time ranchers in the valley."
2,should have been better,"Looking at the names in this live quartet recording - Roy Haynes, Steve Swallow and Gary Burton - one would have expected a great Getz recording. It is not. Getz sounds harried and uninspired on most numbers. This impression is partly produced by a very unbalanced recording: Roy Haynes, a regular in Getz' groups since 1961, is surely one of the greatest drummers in jazz history, but not necessarily the best drummer for Getz - is here miked up front in a very annoying and distracting manner.There is much better stuff by Getz to choose from."
3,worth getting,"Getz' playing here shows, in my opinion, a kinship with Sonny Rollins', rhythmically, and even motivically, which alone is worth hearing."
5,Make Room,"As a Pastor of the average church I was always looking for practical books and methods to move beyond average. When I first came upon Neil's book I thought, ""There is no way simply making room for increase could grow my average church."" I decided to try it out in our nursery area. We simply added a separate room and to my surprise it filled up with in two weeks. We have since added four more child care rooms and in two years our children's department has grown exponentially. The practical application of spiritual laws in this book are amazing. Thanks!"
2,"Dated, but concepts are still useful","The problem with books that talk about specific software is that they become dated rather quickly. This five year old book shows its age. It has lost significant relevance but still contains snippets of wisdom.2 stars because it is dated, probably would have been 4 stars in 2005. my suggestion is not to buy this, I did and I am disappointed."
4,"Useful info, some parts could use a update","Book is a bit out of date, doesn't discuss the newest technologies, but if you need some good guidance on the how and why of development environments, this is a good choice."
1,Blah Blah. Do NOT buy,"this books is full of fluff that it reads like a giant 'feel-good' self-help propaganda, except the author is clue-less on reallife product development. I can not help suspecting that is the result of someone's talking circus trips around country (those 'technology/sales' conference) if you are a mid-level manager at some consulting firm who is pressed by the boss to sell, it will help you B.S. your clue-less customer with big buzz words during yout next sales meeting. otherwise, stay away! I give one star for the cover design only."
5,Phenominal!!,"I first played the original Tomb back in 1980 and barely made it out alive! I thought we killed Acerack then...but I was wrong. Now I DM'd the ""Return"" module and was flabergasted at the content as well as the layout of it. It took my players 4 months of game playing to finish it and they are still talking about it! Top notch gaming material!!"
5,Great Buy!,I ordered this for my daughter after she mentioned how she missed the TV series. I'm glad I did. Fast shipping and a great movie!
5,Scruffy,I used to watch this movie non stop when i was younger. I finally found it and shared it with my 3 year old cousin. I'm 21 now and I love it just as much as I did when I was little. I didn't realize how much it taught me about caring for animals. No wonder I'm such a sucker for helping them. I would recommend this movie to anyone with a child or an adult for that matter.
1,Unwatchable,There was a big black line through the whole movie I was really upset they had good reviews but I guess I got screwed a waist of money and time
4,What were they thinking?,"For the life of me, I can not understand why my kids loved this movie so much. This poor dog suffered terribly and brought bad luck to all who encountered it. I considered burning this tape after about 15 viewings, but I knew I would be forced to purchase another copy. Finally, I doubt there is a movie I have seen more times and enjoyed less. My kids on the other hand, 15 years later still love this movie. What were they thinking?"
2,Utterly boring...,"This is the second text I've come across (in my course requirements, not by choice) and once again it is entirely boring, grammatically uninteresting and occassional errors can even be found. I agree with another reviewer that institutions shouldn't choose books merely because the text fits the class description. Rather, professors should have the freedom to choose the required text. I literally dread reading this book and have come to the point that I basically skim and find answers because actual reading is painfully boring."
2,Boring!,"Compared to other texts of the same nature, this one was boring and dry. Instructors & institutions should take care to select teaching texts that will set the spark of interest in the student. This one won't. It's a b/chore to read."
4,It's a text book,"The transaction was flawless. The product being a text book, well it is what it is... A text book. The a lot of statistical information and tons of information that could be simplified. But for my college course this book was a nessessity."
5,Excellent Instrumental music from the 70s,The Popcorn song sounded Fantastic just as when I was a kid hearing it on the 8 track tape Excellent Quality I would Recommend Hot Butter CD to anyone!!!!
3,Look for the vinyl instead...,"Most of these modern Moog collections seem to be going for the ""Gosh-golly-gee-I-remember-this"" factor. They pick the shortest and cheesiest songs, ignoring some of the (imho) better and more creative stuff. I'm not sure what the reason, but in any case I would recommend you find an inexpensive record player, and think about buying these songs on second-hand vinyl (try Ebay) instead if you like the sound of the Moog. Despite the clicks and pops, you'll get a much better representation of what some of these artists did with analog synthesizers, rather than some record company producer's picks. The 'cheese factor' is just too strong on these CD compilations."
4,What You Don't Know about Retirement,Gave the book as a gift --- used as a guest sign-in book for guests at a surprise retirement party.
4,Funny and right on the mark,"This little paperback is a great inexpensive alternative to a retirement card. Funny, but so realistic in its ironic comedy about the life of retirees. I laughed out loud."
5,"cute and funny, loved it!","Unusual format - a tiny book which is in form of a question and answer for each page. and it is very funny. makes a great gift for someone retiring, though the book is small in size (sp. thickness) so you may want to combine it with a box chocolates etc. should give it to them as a gift. lighthearted and entertaining. look at all aspects of retirement - the great, the not so great and downright bad."
3,Retirement,"I purchased this as a gift for my boss that is retiring. I didn't pay close attention and this book is very small. I was a little disappointed. It is funny, but not quite what I was hoping for."
2,Cute but not that great,"The book is a lot smaller than I thought it would be, and the jokes/questions really weren't that funny. I ordered it as a gift, and when I got it, I realized I needed to go get something else. It's a cute idea to have it accompany a bigger gift."
2,About 1 minute of humor,"As hinted in the description and some other reviews, this book is really just about 100 jokes: 1 line questions followed by 1 line answers. To be sold as a book, I had really expected it to have some additional explanation or insight to expand the thought, although the jokes are really easy enough to figure that out on our own. The time to read it is about as fast as you can turn the pages.Granted, some of the jokes are amusing. This book is best used as a gag gift for someone retiring. I like another reviewer's suggestion to use it as a sign-in book. Having purchased as a Kindle book, I can't even use it for that."
1,Boring,This is a great book for the weak minded.If you find this funny than you are easily amused!More words to finish review.
3,Purchased as gift,Purchased as a gift for the postal carrier. He seemed to like it. What more do I have to say?
3,Not as good as in the photo,"I was a little disappointed with these suspenders. It seems to me that in the photograph the ""base"", that has the padding and the straps attached to it, comes down lower in the chest area than when you are actually wearing it. When the photo was taken the suspenders were flatten out on a table making it look longer than it actually is. It fools you when you look at the photo making you think this is how the suspenders will lay on your chest. This is the reason why some people complain after buying it that the straps are too short. The manufacturer should make this ""base"" longer so when you are wearing it it will look the same as in the photograph."
1,"If your 6 foot plus, don't bother.","I purchased these after reading reviews that other brands were to short, hoping these would work. I am 6'-1"" and these don't even come close. I maxed out the length and if I pull the front straps down to my belt it is tight at my neck and the back straps only reach the center of my back.They do seem to be well made."
2,Not impressed with this product.,the type of buckles that connect the Toolrider GS to the toolbelt do not lock on sufficient to hold a tool belt up well. The buckles also do not fit in most rings that are on attached to tool belts. I would not have bought these suspenders if there would have been pictures of the type of buckles big enough to see on the website.
2,Good product,good product but was not adaptable for my existing tool belt as the clips had difficulty staying on the webbing belt
1,Weak hook,"I can't used it, because the hooks, clips or wherever its called, are weak. The Brown Bag Company 30289 ToolRider GS is not a professional product."
1,inutil,"dinero tirado a la basura. El sistema de sujeción NO sujeta... no sirve para nada. No sirve, No sirve, No sirve, No sirve, No sirve, No sirve, No sirve, No sirve, No sirve, No sirve, No sirve, No sirve, No sirve,"
3,it worked great (when it worked),"I bought this drive when I needed high speed burning and I didn't have a desktop PC that was fast enough to push a 16x burner. I bought it because I read that they were using plextor drives and I'll swear by a plextor on reliability.I got the drive and it was a plextor. Unfortunately, it had been damaged in shipping. I guess the UPS man dropped it. I sent it back to amazon and got a replacement about a week later.This drive was a Teac, but the thing worked perfectly. I burned tons of cd's. I was in college at the time and moved about every semester but otherwise the thing just sat on my desk. I wasn't carrying it around a whole lot.One day (about a month after the warranty ran out) the thing just quit. It won't read or write a cd. Win98 will recognize it as a drive but you can't get any data from it.It was a good drive but don't count on it for a long term solution. I'm buying a new desktop next and i'll put an internal plextor in it."
1,I Hate It!,"I hate it!! After waiting for nearly a month, it arrived (today 12/13) with no users's manual (not even on disc), no drivers (I assume they are needed) no instructions on how to even turn the thing on!!.... only the ""Toast"" software installation disc.""Toast"" will not recognize the drive. There is no phone number for technical support ( I hate that!). No helpfull info on the QPS Web-site.I also own an equivelent LaCie Firewire drive which works flawlessly.I thought it was designed for ""portable"" use (it does come in a nifty carrying case) however, the thing is big and bulky. As I bought for use with my Mac laptop it is apparently of no use to me and I intend to return it.I'm sorry I bought it1"
5,Portable and Easy...,This is the easiest CD-RW drive I've worked with. Includes BURNproof technology that creates skip free music and NO COASTERS! Everything in one convenient carrying case makes it easily portable. I also recently purchased one of QPS' 20G external hard drives...works like a charm...
3,This drive is outdated! And huge!,"I bought this drive in late 2000 when it was perhaps the best choice. In today's market it is outdated by smaller and better designed drives from other manufacturers.The case is huge, with lots of empty space around the sides and top for no reason other than a designer's idea of how the drive should look. The power supply is outside the case and is one of those huge annoying black ""bricks.""The power connector is fussy to plug in (din connector) and delicate. On one of my drives the brick failed completely.I fixed it by doing what most users do these days, I put the QPS drive in a PYRO external case, which has a built in power supply, and is about the same size as the original QPS case."
1,This company is a joke!,I have a QPS burner and it has been nothing but trouble. It throws errors all of the time and is basically useless. I have tried to contact the company numerous times for help and technical support and they have never responded. A friend of mine who used to work for a large electronics store told me this company has a reputation for poor product support and customer service.
5,Fully capable little box,"I needed a CD-RW drive for my iMac and, since I had FireWire connectivity, I went looking for FireWire drives. The QPS drive was the fastest drive available at the time for what I deemed a reasonable price and it had received good reviews so I picked it up.I have not been disappointed. Documentation was well done and connecting the drive and setting it up to burn CDs was a snap. Though the packaging contained third-party software, I chose to use Apple's iTunes to burn my first CD, in order to check on compatibility. The burn was flawless and seemed fast (though I have little basis for comparison) and has played well in several different systems.So for quick, easy CD burning for your Mac, I can highly recommend the QPS drive."
1,Good TV-movie - LOUSY DVD (junk quality bootleg),"Once again, Televista, a video/DVD pirating operation, gives us another homemade DVD-R with cruddy quality, color Xerox sleeve art - the usual ""high"" standards that all of their garbage products exhibit.Don't be a sucker. Don't buy their junk. And, Amazon, quit letting them sell their illegitimate crap here!"
3,Good for teenagers,"I read this series for the first time as a teenager, and I have to note with some sadness that I think it's definitely lost stars for me as an adult reader.The premise of the Spellsinger series is that an aspiring singer/lawyer (Jon-Tom) is pulled into an alternative universe where all animals except lizards can talk and think and he has magical powers as a spellsinger. But since all he knows are rock songs from our western world, his results are occasionally unpredicatable.In this book, Jon-Tom has to go searching for medicine for his mentor Clothahump. On the way he picks up a 7-foot high white tiger, his irascable companion Mudge, and a teenage street kid named Folly. Hilarity and mayhem ensues.The spellsinger books are light on the realism and heavy on the humor. Note that many of the jokes are dependent on knowing pop culture from the 80s. I laughed at the Def Leppard jokes. Current teens may not get them."
3,a bit disappointed,"This book covers a lot of territory and hikes, and it gives good directions on how to get to the hikes and how to follow the trail, but I was disappointed. Although it's 258 pages long, it does not provide a whole lot of background information on what you are going to see on the hike--just where to turn left or right, etc. How about what I'm going to see other that just say ""there is an overlook?"" What kind of overlook? What am I going to see? There are quick mentions of a few plants and animals that may be seen, but certainly no background on them to help me identify them or know about their natural history. Very little, if any, mention of human history is provided.The contents shows 70 hikes, but as you look through the book you find multiple hikes in several areas that could have been identified as just one longer hike. In all it identifies 46 sites to take hikes in.It is a nice book to direct you to some good hikes in WV, but don't expect much more than that."
2,dubious...,"Nobody should read this book without reading Tim Mitchell's account of the author and book in The Rule of Experts (2002) -- it's clear that Critchfield deliberately left out a long history of social and economic change, and may have plagiarized sections of Ayrout's The Egyptian Peasant, writing a book that is more of a confirmation of western readers' expectations (and hence very well-received) than an ethnography."
4,He should've waited some time before he wrote this boook!,"When I read the other review I just had to comment. This WAS an interesting book, but it was a bit childish. It is as if Piers Anthony had several interesting ideas, but didn't really know how to write a novel about them - the results seems confused and unconvincing. I think it's a book to read when you REALLY have nothing else to read."
4,itchin for a scratch,"Ted Nugent's Cat Scratch Fever is my favorite album from him. A great classic rocker from start to finish. The famous title track is my least favorite song on here, but that one is still good with an awesome riff. If you like Ted Nugent this is a must-have CD. The music of Wang Dang Sweet Poontang is incredible, I wish it had decent lyrics. Home Bound is one of my all time favorite rock guitar instrumentals. Standout tracks include: Death by Misadventure, Live It Up, A Thousand Knives."
3,Book & CD,"The material is great,as I would expect from Charlie McCoy. However the CD is difficult to work with. You must listen to it all the way through or not at all. Its not programable so I could not go back and review a particular area. You must start from the beginning each time."
5,LOVE these pens!,"I rented a camera case one time, and one of these had been left in a pocket. I managed to forget to stick another pen in the case on the day of my shoot, so I ended up using this. I LOVED it! As soon as I got home, I looked it up online to get some more.The pen writes really smoothly, not skipping like other pens do. I just got to the end of one pen, and that was the first time it ever didn't write as soon as I opened the cap. The ink dries pretty quickly (especially for being gel), and I didn't have problems with it smearing all that much (and I usually do, on any pen... not just gel pens). Anyone else that has borrowed a pen has commented on how much they like these pens, too. I would definitely recommend them!"
5,The Real Thing,"This is what Gulden's wishes it were, if it didn't have to be dumbed-down and blandified for the masses.Mister Mustard is hot, vinegary, and hits you in the nose.Add a hotdog and some onions and you have some kinda heaven in your mouth."
5,Funny show!,My cousin got this for my grandparents and I was watching it and it's sooooo funny! It's one of the best English comedies I can think of. Get it!
5,"'Allo 'Allo! The Complete Series 5, Parts 1 & 2",Great series! Stumbled on this at public television which was shown on the BBC. Humor galore and a must if you like British humor!!!! About a French cafe owner during WWII and all of his misadventures!!
3,"Cute, but nowhere near as funny as lots of BBC comedies","There are endearing characters, but some, like the waitresses, are one-joke characters and it's just not funny after a while. In fact, the only characters who keep being funny are the cafe owner, the main commandant, and the gay lieutenant. Everyone else has a very narrow range. Some good jokes on the French and the English stereoptypes. I just saw series I and II. Maybe the later ones are better. It never makes much sense that Rene harps on how stupid his wife it - she's a bad singer, and she acts blind to Rene's flirting with the waitresses, but she seems no less bright than everyone else. And the old man spy is annoying. Maybe the people who like this grew up on cliche-ridden WWII dramas, so they have more context than I do."
4,Listen to this with pleasure until Andeas Scholl records it,"This is a wonderful opera and the recording does it justice. The orchestra sounds very fine, particularly the oboes, piccolo ""birds"" and the pizzicato sections. At all times the crispness of the dotted rhythms keeps the work moving.Cotrubas and Scovotti are in good voice. ""Lascia ch'io pianga"" moved me to tears and Almira's equivocating magic worked very well. The other roles were also well sung.Having recently heard a fine performance by Opera Australia with Graham Pushee in the title role, I missed the agility of his voice, particularly in the second theme of ""Cara sposa"". It would be wonderful to hear Andreas Scholl in this work.In summary, I would recommend adding this to your collection now, especially if your budget extends to a second copy if Andreas obliges."
3,Pretty shoes but narrow,I think there should have been a notice regarding how very narrow these shoes were. I had gotten them for a special occasion so wore them anyway but they were too narrow and if I had not had to wear them I would have returned them.
2,For a class,"I'm finding it rather boring and haven't really learned anything new at this point. If you aren't already a teacher, you may find it more useful."
1,rubbish,"just got dis perfume, guess i should not ve been expectin much, but i am totally disappointed wit dis perfume. like totally, should ve taken anoda instead. d smell is ok, but it does not linger long at all."
5,fabulous,this is really a chilling story and even though Meg won her battle in court nothing will ever take away the pain and hurt that she has had to endure with for so long. there are so many sick people in this world and after reading this it just makes me wonder how could a mother put a price on a child this way to let someone abuse and hurt a precious child. no amount of wealth is worth anyone abusing a child. keep up the good work and please continue to write because I'm sure that this will be a wake-up call for many.
5,Heartbroken,"I just got through reading this book - 3/26/01. This child that was tortured by not only her father but also abused by her mother is the reason why so many children are suffering in our society. If you get a chance please read this book. If you see child abuse, please report it. You may wonder why Meg Clairmonte continued accepting the horror from her stepfather even after she became 21. The reason for this is her mind was totally programmed at the hands of this beast, her stepfather. Also her trying to keep her mother happy. Please read and learn from this book. This child/woman, Meg, will never be the same. I have also suffered this way and I know that this is a true story."
1,More sensationalism of a very sad story,"I cannot believe that this woman says she was grown, married, and living in her own home, and still allowed this to happen to her. Did her front door not have a lock on it? Could she not tell her husband to help her? Does she feel vindicated now that she has money? Has her money made her happier, or given her any peace? And what about her brother? How has this story helped him?"
5,Memoirs of a dysfunctional family relationship.,A heart wrenching story that makes one wonder how many others are and have been treated as second class by their family due to race and/or circumstance. I could not put the book down until I finished.
1,Could Have Done Better,"Having read this author's work in other venues, I am very disappointed in the writing and the subject matter. Any type of sensationalising of child abuse is distasteful to me. The book appeals to the prurient interests of people, but offers no education about the subject."
5,"Bizarre in a wonderful way, great pictures by Gorey","This is a book I loved as a child, because it was so bizarre and interesting and mysterious! I don't think the book is really meant to have a message---it's meant more just to be a strange and memorable tale! I love all the little details about Treehorn we find out---that he has 56 different favorite TV shows, what his cereal send-away collection consists of, etc! Even my 2 year old was enchanted by the pictures---he called a page with several odd dogs on it ""monsters"" and said ""I like those scary monster dogs!"" My 5 year old loved how the bus driver thought Treehorn was Treehorn's younger brother, also called Treehorn! Read it because it's fun and great to look at!"
5,Do you REALLY Listen to Your Kids?,"Treehorn's parents are so wrapped up in their own problems that they don't notice Treehorn is shrinking, Neither do any of the other adults. This speaks to the sad fact that many kids feel they are invisible to grown-ups. However, the book is lighthearted and fun, with terrific illustrations. One you will remember for a long time."
5,Excellent information,Very good DVD and excellent positions and movements. So glad I purchased this DVD. It has already helped my bad back.
5,Yoga for he Rest of Us: Easy Yoga for Easing Pain with Peggy Cappy,"I love this! I knew nothing about Yoga and because of my knees, other types of exercises haven't worked for me. However, I can exercise along with this video with no pain, and I feel great afterwards. I recommen this video to anyone who has been sedentary for a while due to joint pain."
4,good for us older folks,"I have other Peggy Cappy tapes and this one is a nice addition to my collection! Sitting while doing yoga poses is exactly what I need sometimes. Thanks, Peggy, for another great video."
4,happy with purchase,"Have not viewed yet, but looking forward to using when physically able. Have been looking for a DVD that I can easily use."
1,not for me,this DVD had to many difficult moves for me - liked other people as trainers - I have to many medical conditions so this DVD was to difficult to folow
2,Easy Yoga,"I didn't like Peggy, her earnest goody goody manner, and she talked too much at the beginning, a waste of space. I thought it would be all seated yoga, which it wasn't. The standing part introduced new moves too quickly. It is not nearly as useful as anticipated, and had I seen it before buying, I would not have purchased it."
2,Wish I could use this at all,"Yoga for the Rest of Us: Easy Yoga for Easing PaiI paid full price for this item only to find that I need to update my video card to get past the security coding. My laptop is newer, and I have never had this problem with any other DvD; surely the security is a bit overboard. Hopefully I'll be able to view this when I have more time to update my system. :PThis is an Amazon review, and the product was purchased as an Amazon Prime product."
2,Pill Timer,"This is a very handy gadget once you figure out how the timer works, but you have to reset it all each day. Once you have the current time entered you have to set the alarm using how much time is left before you want it to beep. You don't set the alarm like a clock. It's confusing at first, but it can work. If it's 8 am clock time and you need to take a pill at noon, you have to set the alarm to beep in 4 hours. If you also need to take one at 2pm you need to set the second alarm to beep in 6 hours and so on."
3,Alzheimers timers,"This thing sucks. The directions suck. Once you thought you have it right, HA! You missed another dose. As others say, it more like a count down clock, with PMS. Another draw back the pill chambers are really small. Truely if you took that little of Rx you wouldn't really need a timer. It's a great concept. But concepts don't help you from missing your medication. Even at $3.00 its a waste of money..."
3,Pretty,"This is very pretty, although, it is very heavy and you will need a much heavier chain than the one that comes with it. It had great clarity and is a unique design, with a great price."
2,Needs more grommets,"The wind blows this cover off my car every single day. If it weren't for the cable lock, this cover would have blown out of my neighborhood and into the ocean long ago. It's a good material, but it desperately needs more gromments and bungee cords to hold it on the car. I find it hard to believe that BMW would create an outdoor car cover that is only effective when the weather is perfect, but that's what they did here. Shop elsewhere, you'll be disappointed with this one."
5,Superb Dice Cup!,"If you're looking for a well-made dice cup in the ""old"" style - with that perfect feel, look and (leather) smell you remember from years ago, I think you'll be as pleased with this finely-crafted item as I am.It's refreshing to find a product made these days that matches the quality of those made years ago. In addition, this dice cup comes with five white, ultra smoooooth 5/8 inch dice which are a joy to handle."
5,Leather Dice Cup,"this toy was a gift for the grandpa-child. It made him happy, great sound/feel. and this makes 6 more words"
5,Excellent Conversation Item,"This calendar was a gift. It's one of the first things that greet my guests when they enter my home. You are instantly drawn in by the artful colors. No matter which month we're in, one has to view the other months just out of curiosity.Not only is this a great calendar but it has introduced us to some very talented African American artists. I'm now anxious to get the 2003 version!! (hint, hint) :-)"
1,Not worth the money,I just bought this video. If you are buying it for the jump rope portion don't waste your money. The video consists of you watching Roger Koo and his class (who most of them can't even jump rope). He doesn't show you any new things to keep jump roping interesting or to get a variety in your work out. The video is blurry and the camera man doesn't even hold the camera straight. The audio has a lot of static as well. WASTE OF MONEY.
3,What's on it,"Ambush: A couple of hired guns make the mistake of ambushing one of Roy's friends on the Double-R Bar Ranch.Empty Saddles: A series of near-fatal 'accidents' have occurred on Roy's big cattle drive, and his ranch hands are disappearing one at a time. Roy and the gang must figure out who is responsible before someone gets killed!The Knockout: A training camp for boxer Willy ?Killer"" Conley has sprung up on a desolate corner of Roy's ranch. When his 'guests' are spotted digging for something, Roy investigates the suspicious gang. Charles Bronson guest stars.Sheriff Missing: A note has been found convincing the people of Mineral City that Sheriff Blodgett has run away in disgrace for accepting bribes, but Roy suspects foul play."
5,Husband loves it!,"Bought this for my husband and he said it was the best he has ever had. He had me order 2 more, 1 for him and 1 for his Dad. They make a nice gift for someone who likes salmon. Also a great price on Amazon!"
5,Dad was thrilled!,"I bought this as a gift for my Dad who is hard to buy for because he already has almost everything, that said he was THRILLED to get this as a gift , impressed with the box and that it was a full pound. He called after eating it to tell me it was amazing and that i can just send him this for all his birthdays and xmas lol. so i say its money well spent. It did not ship in 2 days like most prime items but it did get there a day before they said it would. I would not hesitate to purchase this again. Thanks Amazon!"
1,Ugghhhhhh!!!!!,The smoked salmon was absolutely disgusting. The box is very neat but also put together very poorly in CHINA! I would not recommend buying this. Don't waste your money.
2,Not Worth the Money,I sent this out as a gift to two different persons (who are family) this Xmas and asked that they give me an honest review. Both separately reported that it tasted no better than canned salmon--which I could have got for half the price.
3,so so,we planned to give these as gifts but sadly we found the taste and smell unpleasant. The box was nice though.
2,disappointed -,"I don't order often from ANYWHERE but if I do 8 or 10 times it's Amazon. Because I love to eat fish esp. smoked salmon - I though it was a great deal. I was disappointed, packages were small and the fish fillets were thin,and really not that great of taste. Smoked? where? I would have given it one star - but I didn't hate it - just wouldn't order it again."
1,"Rank, Gross and Disgusting . . .","I have eaten Smoked Salmon for sixty years, I love it, but the stink of this stuff was enough to turn your stomach. And, if possible the second package was worse than the first. Both tasted as bad as they smelled . . ."
1,Spit It On The Floor !!!,"I grew up on the Columbia River and have tasted all levels of quality in smoked salmon. This was the worst, and an insult to every salmon smoker who has ever lived. This is Not Smoked Salmon, this is some vile slop."
4,As a Gift,"I purchased this item as Christmas gifts for two people on my list who are difficult to buy for. The price was within my alloted budget, and when I purchased two, they were eligible for FREE Super Saver Shipping, which is always a big PLUS! The packaging is very attractive and larger than I was expecting (18.5""x7""x2""). Although I have no idea of the quality of the salmon (hence the 4-star rating), if I were to receive this as a gift, I would be pleased. I'd consider buying this item again when I need a gift for under $20.00."
2,More than advertised,"While I agree this is shipped in a nice wooden box that can be used for other things and the fish has an excellent flavor, I was surprised to find it was not what I expected. I expected smoked lox salmon like you find at a good deli or grocery store, not fully cooked salmon as this actually is. For those expecting the latter, this is a great product, however this is not for me as it was smoked (or cooked) too long."
4,Great ball....,"The color is exactly as shown.This was a big hit for our 9 year old nephew on Christmas!Had to inflate it when received which was ok, but wanted to let others know."
5,nice,love the color. Just keep in mind these are rubber and not leather so it gives a totally different bounce when you are shooting baskets and it hits the basket or backboard. I bought this for me gym so that they couldn't be confused with anyone elses basketball.
1,Too Small,"Fortunately, my ex- wife, who suffers from hypertension can use this product. I cannot. The cuff adjusts from 8.66 to 12.6 in. I am not obese but my upper arm measures 15.5 in. relaxed. I am not out any money because she can use it but specs should show min. and max adjustability."
2,ok,ok- It was something that I brought as a presemt. It would not be something I brought for myself ok
1,VERY INACCURATE,"At the lower range of blood pressure the device is accurate. BUT- as blood pressure goes higher, it is very, VERY inaccurate. My Doctor says it is not safe to use. If you have one, DON'T TRUST IT !!! Using the device has resulted in very misleading info."
1,Very Inaccurate Monitor,"Higher blood pressures from 130-150 systolic, and 90-95diastolic, were wrong. Also if one takes beta blockers forhypertension, this model gives wrong readings.The monitor's month, & date stops working 1 year after purchase, despite inserting new batteries correctly."
5,Good Pop CD,"I don't really care for U.S. pop but when I go abroad, I usually find a group that gets me going. I heard Sugababes on the radio in Germany a lot. When I returned to the U.S. and saw the CD, I had to buy it to reminisce. I really like the music on the album."
3,Police tv weak,"Police TVWell, the book ""Police TV"" is a book, cool, short. which tells the story of a series of robberies that occur in a shopping center, Sue and Dan, are policemen and go in search of the thief, and after an arduous search to locate along Ana's complice. This story does not change over the course of it we don't have many action. Anyway, I did not like the book I think the book is BAD. The only positive point is easy to understand the words.Rafael."
1,A Chils is waiting,This was a girt and the person i gave it to was unable to play itWhat a waste of my moneyA Child is waiting
1,Wrong viewing format,Did not know I was purchasing a DVD formatted for Region 2 viewing; I am in the Region 1 viewing area. We are in the process of returning it to the vendor.
3,Correction to first review from Northern California,It was not Billy Mumy (sic) who played Reuben Widdicombe but Bruce Ritchey.
3,A bit dated,"Though the acting is okay in this the movie is quite dated. If you work with handicapped students you might consider it worth a look, but otherwise I'd skip this one."
3,important topic and leading stars keep film afloat,"This is a thought-provoking film on the difficulties when dealing with children with disabilities. THe film is dated in its dialogue, and it is quite sheltered, by today's comparisons. The supporting performers (the children) are heart-breaking, and Lancaster and (especially) Garland put in beautiful work themselves."
5,A short yet Very Sweet experience,"Sagan presents a kind of deep awareness of the female psyche, in youth and in age. Truly a pleasure to read and engage with."
4,Easy to read and great story,"I wish I read French so I could read the original writing. However, you can still tell Francoise Sagan is a great writer even with the English edition of her works."
3,Pretty Light Fair,"You know how when you read a short book and you think ""why am I so lazy in writing my novel? I could do this."" THis is that kind of book. MOre like a novella than a novel, this book involves a girl, her father and his serious girlfriend. The girl doesn't know why the father decides to get married when he had a good thing going as a playboy but he does and the woman is alternately controlling and sweet. MOstly she just tries to be the parent that the protagonist never had.It ends badly.While some will say that this is deceptively simple, but actually it's pretty simple. A girl hates her stepmother. But she feels bad about it. THen they seem to get along when she is a little more reflective. Then the potential stepmother does something else.It's short. It's pretty light. She was 18 when she wrote it so that's impressive but it's not particularly insightful or deep."
5,Sad but beautiful,This novella is nice and short. It is very beautifully written. You might not like the narrator but she knows what she's about. Bonjour Tristesse is deservedly very famous but its immediate impact on French society was because of its immorality. Actually I think the book has real depth. It has a certain sensual quality that makes it really live in your imagination. It's not just a story. You are there in the narrator's world. That's why I give it 5 stars.
4,Excellent read,"I found Bonjour Tristesse an incredibly moving and stimulating book, which I would recommend to anyone who is intruiged by the emotions that a young woman goes through during her adolescense. The book touched on love, her relationship with her father and the other women that enter her and her fathers life. Sagan writes with a flowing and very realistic style, which I found interesting to read. A really fresh and thought provoking book with an excellent ending."
4,Good reading,I read this book when I was 20 in Turkish. After 2 years I watched its movie and re-read the book. It is really a good book.
1,Never arrived,"I ordered and paid for this book and it never arrived and I have been unable to get my money back. This seller is false - do not order from them. If anyone in a position to help me reads this, please do help me get my money back. This is outrageous."
5,One of the most underrated albums of the 1970s,"My older sister had this on LP back when it was released. Mother's Finest is one of the most underrated bands of their era. While they had some success, they weren't nearly as successful as they should have been. This is a truly classic album. It is the perfect party album. It is a great blend of hard rock n' roll, funk, & R&B. Bands today just don't make music like this. They all pale in comparison to what was created on this album. It's hard to pick a favorite. They're all classics. Go buy this album. It is very much relevant today. All generations can get off on this stuff."
1,Another Mother Further,"I placed the order on 8/14/01 and as of today, the friend I sent it to has not received it. One month is not impressive!"
5,WAAAAAAAAAAAAY Under rated!!!!!!,"This funked up rock band was before it's time. This is truly tasteful funk at it's best. Joyce has the voice of a true Diva, more soul than today's modern day Divas. Anyone would agree that Joyce can shine just as bright sitting beside all the Arethas, the Gladyses and Tinas. MF is one brilliant mixture of attitude and talent. HOW they ever slid under the radar and missed all the billboard/award blah blah will forever be a mystery to me. Frankly they were short changed and robbed of one heck of a career ride."
3,Street Fighter Alpha 2 Pack,I like the fact that u get both alpha movies in one package. Space saving is key for me.
5,another great CD,"I know many people miss the old AJ, but I personally like his new vocal range. I saw him play in Chicago last summer and he did a great job. Hats off to you AJ for another great album."
3,ok but not great,"The texture of this cloth wasn't what I wanted it to be. Other folks might not mind it, but for me it tarnished the whole washing experience."
2,Arrived with old batteries,"The lights arrived with old leaking batteries.I replaced them with new batteries and they work but they are supposed to come with new batteries, luckily I had some at home."
3,Good for the beginner,"This is a great little pond to get the beginners feet week. Although once we got started, we ended up upgrading. This is solely due to the fact that when started digging, we got a little more ambitious than expected and needed a bigger liner. The shipping was unbelievably fast and I could not wait to get started. My only advice, stick with the proper dimensions (depth included) and this should suit the beginner well."
4,Fascinating hypnotic tapes,"Glauberman is a master of the dual induction technique of hypnosis in which he tells a separate story to each ear. You need headphones to use these tapes. They are very relaxing. Whether they work or not to produce prosperity is another story. I've had them for a few weeks and will have to see if repeated listening improves my financial situation. In any case, they are enjoyable to listen to and do induce a refreshing hypnotic trance. If my income improves substantially over the coming year, I'll write an addendum to this review to give feedback on the outcome."
5,just what she wanted,this was just what she wanted and makes doing her hair easier and faster than ever it work great and really is worth the money
5,Works great,This item works great for soft curils. The added blow dryer works good on damp hair.Thanks for a great product.
5,love It,Love this Tangle=free product. Easier than my old hot=air curler as it do not have a detangler. Great price and fast service.
4,salon edition hot air brush,"Ist im Grossen und Ganzen gut,nur manchmal verfangen sich die Haare und es ist nicht einfach diese wieder abzurollen. Zum Glueck ist es nicht allzuoft passiert . Bin zufrieden"
2,"Salon Edition Hot Air Brush--3/4""","Concept is great for easy styling of short hair. However, this keeps cutting out on me--is there a short in it?"
1,Unable to get accurate readings.,"I have had this unit for awhile, and just recently tried again to get a decent reading out of it. No such luck. There is a chance that it isn't the unit. The max arm circumference for the included standard cuff is .5 inch less than my arm circumference. Whether that is enough for the unit to fail to detect a pulse, drop the pulse reading after detecting it, and get confused as to whether or not it has taken a reading I don't know. All I know is it doesn't work well enough for me to use it."
1,Cheaply manufactured,"Both the black and gray undershirts have been manufactured out of cheap, thin, cotton material and are uncomfortable next to your skin. The dyes used smell distastefully strong and required three washings to become odorless and wearable. The shirts also ran a bit smaller than sized. I would not buy these shirts again and, with a clear conscience, I cannot recommend them to anyone else."
4,Could've been a 5,"The sharpening stone is one of the best. I've never had any complaints with this product, but the sheath is cheap. It is made of cheap material and is easily torn. This was bought as a replacement for one that was lost (it was also an EZ-LAP). The sheath that was lost was made of good, thick leather. It was a much better product."
1,Doesn't work,"I've had two of these Analog clocks so far, hoping the second one would work. Theoretically, these clocks use a signal that is transmitted from NIST (a US government agency) in order to set the time automatically. However, neither clock could pick up the signal. Another digital clock right next to this Analog model did pick up the signal without any problem. Additionally, the Analog model had other basic construction problems.Don't buy the Analog model. Buy the digital model. The digital clock that actually works is below:La Crosse Technology WT-5360U Atomic Projection Alarm Clock"
3,Little known anthology...,"I found this out of print collection of fictional stories about cults a while back. I enjoyed it.It has a variety of authors and a long spanning selection of stories ranging from 1935 to 1990 .There is even a story by H.G. Wells included.There is probably a little something in here to appeal to most tastes.My favorite story in the collection is ""The Questing Tycoon"" by Leslie Charteris. It is about the famous character Simon Templar aka The Saint in Haiti among voodoo adherents.Its a decent collection worth reading."
3,What could have been but wasn't...,"A pity that such cast and means do not yield better results. Cotrubas is as always the lovely singer but Domingo is at his coarsest, the voice unbearably throaty and the vocal acting as false as a $3 bill. The rest of the cast and conducter give a routine performance, which is not worth their reputation."
3,don't waste your money,"'bel canto' it's not only a question of beuty voices. Both main performers have beauty voices but this a opera they don't need to record or even perform, especially Domingo, because is not into their repertoire. In opera is always, very, very important to have the right type of voices for each role beacuse if don't, like in this recording, everything sounds false. If you want to hear Domingo and Cotrubas togheter try with his 'Traviata' under Kleiber conduction. And think about this...do you really like Placido Domingo's voice?"
1,Disappointing,"Like A_Vinajay, I too had heard nothing but praise for the author. After reading various stories by this author, I was left extremely disappionted. Granted, his style is unique, but his stories are also unique in that they lack any direction. In essence, A Narayan tells very poor stories, well."
5,Excellent Short Stories,R.K Narayan brings to life the people and places as he narrates the story. I would strongly recommend this book for the people interested in Indian culture.
2,I wasn't very impressed,"I didn't find this video erotic at all. It is very choppy. They show you what to do in sections for each part of the body, then they show a couple doing it and you're supposed to follow along with the couple. But then when the instructor moves on to the next part of the body, you're supposed to stop and watch, then do it with the couple?? Kinda ruins the mood to have to stop the massage each time they teach it to you. I just followed the first time then kept touching as the second couple did it. I found it kinda hard to do the massaging on the bed. You need a table or maybe the floor with lots of space."
3,"Great if you're in the mood,,, but not technical enough!","This video gives no background on WHY you're doing any of the massages. It has value for a basic massage, so if you know nothing at all it's a start. Don't waste money on it if you want a technical guide. In the end, once you know these basic moves, it's the massage oil that does the trick. If the couple is in the mood, you'll have an enjoyable evening and of course, sex... that's why you're buying this thing isn't it? Just don't think you'll work out any other kinks as a masseuse!"
2,Not Good,These boots are way too narrow. I ordered a 11.5 Medium D.Not even close to a fit. I really tried to like these bootsbut was very disappointed. Toe is too pointy too.They weren't a price bargain either.
4,A nice romance book by the Queen of romance writing.,"I have been a fan of Nora Roberts for some time now and recently read Dual Image. This book is an older title by Nora Roberts first published in 1985 as part of her Language of Love series. It is a rather typical romance book. Boy meets Girl and they fall in love but their is an obstacle to their love. Finally they are able to overcome the obstacle and true love reigns. Despite the fact that we know the ending will be a happy one, the author does a fine job of taking us on both the journey and the final destination.Dual Image is set in Manhattan and I particularly enjoyed reading about this city's landmarks as the couple travel around. But it was a bit eerie when the Twin Towers were mentioned.I do recommend this book and many others by this author. Today Dual Image has been reprinted along with Local Hero, which is also set in Manhattan, in the one volume book, Truly Madly."
3,Alco tester,"I am happy with my purchase, but I must say this product deserves an ambivalent review. If it worked consistently it would be much more useful. I find that I often get a false negative result - a reading of ""zero"" when it should reflect some alcohol. Therefore, I have to question the accuracy of the results it gives when I do get a positive result. On the other hand, I have seen a fair amount of consistency when used infrequently (multiple uses seems to overload the system) and according to directions - the 20 minute wait between a drink and a test is absolutely necessary. I have to say I was surprised by how quickly I can be in the ""danger zone"" - better to take my own reading (and adjust my driving schedule accordingly) than to have the police administer the test!"
1,Product does not work right.,This product only really works when you are really drinking. When I had a beer and tested it by the book it did not register. I owned a AlcoHawk slim which was much cheaper and would at least register when you had less to drink. I am not satisfied at all with the product and am sending it in to get calibrated new out of the box. I would not recommend this product and learned the hard way.
3,from vhs to dvd,i've had this TUSK DOC and concert vhs forever and have wanted it on dvd. i was shocked to get a copy that looks worse than my twenty or more year old vhs. it looks like it was copied from a bad vhs and has a line going thru it at the top for the whole thing. its murky and not cleaned up. SARA is still that edited version. i'm glad i have it on dvd it has some real great things in it. but in the future i would love an official release with extras and unedited performances.
5,"This book is a ""keeper"".","I bought Prof. Edminister's earliar Electric Circuits book when I took his class in college over 20 years ago. I learned far more from his book than any other book on electric circuits. This book belongs on the bookshelf of every practicing electrical engineer. I've referred to Edminister's book more often than any other engineering book I own. The clear exposition and the terrific depth of solved example problems make this book a ""keeper"". -Rick Lyons- author of ""Understanding Digital Signal Processing"""
4,Good supplement,"This is book is a very good supplement for a class in introductory circuit analysis. The techniques are explained in a clear and concise manner. The examples and exercises provided are very appropriate and serve to provide a good understanding in the subject matter. My only complaints about the book are that some areas are not covered as thoroughly as I would have liked (for example, the section on Thevenin and Norton Equivalents) and that some techniques of circuit analysis were left out. However, many other things that were not clearly explained in textbooks were made comprehensible with the help of this book."
4,"Good, but not a place to Start",This book assumes you know some advanced math and doesn't go over basic concepts with much detail. It does present good information for more advanced circuit analysis techniques and is a great book for someone looking to review or touch up on material.
3,decent materials but bad binding,"The book itself is a decent collection of practice problems. However, I ended up with a copy that was stiched together improperly. For some reason, the first 32 pages appears twice, skipping the the second 32 pages of the book such that parts of chapter 3 and all of chapter 4 are completely missing. I couldn't return the item due to the policy of the seller regarding books lik Shaum's, but I was given the publisher's phone number. Let's hope I can get this resolved satisfactorily."
2,I really expected MORE from this one,"I bought this book about 6 years ago , recently I was fired from my job and begin using it as a refresher on the circuit analysis and electrical engineering foundations. And let me say that this book really needs a revised version!!! IT is good on the study of amps and some circuit analysis , but it is a real stinker in the sense that it does not have enough example ,and in some cases the examples are too easy . If you are having problems with your circuit analysis class at the University please STAY AWAY from this book.!!!"
1,Lots of errors in solved-problems,Very difficult to follow. He didn't give the detailed explanation of the formulas being used. There are quite a few errors in the solved problems that obviously contradict to each other.
1,not surprised they discontinued it,"Let's see, how can I say this diplomatically........ OK, here goes; this camera ..... The picture quality is poor, the sharpness of the images is poor. The flash on button sticks out so that when you put it in your case, or as in my wifes case, her purse, all it has to do is bump something and the flash gets turned on. It doesn't have a battery saver, so you may take one picture, put the camera away and when you get it out next time the batteries are dead. This has happened to us innumerable times in spite of our awareness of the problem. It's one of those things that gets you no matter how careful you are. I wouldn't buy one used even if it were dirt cheap. Other than that, it's a great camera............."
3,Where is the hose spray??,"The product itself works well. The smell only subsides temporarily. I had to buy my own hose spray due to my package not including the actual hose attachment as stated. That is probably my biggest complaint about this purchase. In all fairness to the company, I never complained to them directly but, I didn't feel like going through the hoops."
3,Works okay-bleach works better,"I run a dog day care and boarding facility. This product was recommended to me by another smaller facility so I thought Id give it a shot. It worked well in knocking down the odor a peg or two, but did not destroy the odor completely. Two days later we had a heavy rain storm and the odor was back with avengence.I chatted with a veterinarian who recommended diluted bleach for both the boarding yard and the day care yard. The bleach works sooooo much better than the yard odor killer. Its is safe to use on grass, cement, wooden fence, etc. It also kills disease and bacteria.I actually fill the naturvet hose spray bottle with the bleach and it dilutes it perfectly, and the bleach is so much cheaper than the yard odor killer product.I recommend bleach over this product!"
4,Odor Killer Review,"The product does a great job of eliminating odors in our dog run, but it can be fairly expensive to use unless you buy the double pack. You do have to be careful when applying it, as the container will empty very quickly. A moderate application once a week is usually sufficient to keep odor under control."
4,Economical approach to back yard smells,"I have four large dogs, and with the heat of the summer and lack of rain, I tried this product. There was a similar one at the store for a few dollars more, but this one has a refill bottle that you can purchase for cheaper. For people with lots of pets, I would recommend using this at least monthly as one treatment isn't a solve-all. This product would be the most economical way to keep you back yard smelling better as you can purchase the refill kit. One bottle was enough to cover my entire back yard, so I was very satisfied. It hooks up well with the hose and I didn't have any trouble."
4,good outdoor spray,"I like this product because not many are safe for your plants. Also the smell is fairly pleasant. The only problem is that it is fairly expensive. I could use one bottle each time I clean my outside. I would like to adjust the amount of liquid that comes out. I bought an empty outdoor sprayer that allows you to adjust the amount of liquid, so that helps."
4,Good,I gave this product to my son for use in his yard where a new puppy plays and spends many hours. My son says that the product helps to reduce the odors.
3,Coverage is grossly misstated. Did work to minimize the smell but did not eliminate it.,Coverage is not close to what is advertised. I would suggest using it in a small enclosed area. Cannot submit the review unless I add additional meaningless words.
3,"Didn't work for me, unfortunately","I had high hopes this would make a big difference in our dog run, but I think our very hard ground (decomposed granite) might just need a more thorough approach. I did use it as instructed, and put a very thorough soaking on the entire area, and for the day if seemed to smell much better. But the next afternoon when it warmed up, they unsavory smell of dog pea was back. But for the cost, it was well worth the try!"
2,Simple green imposter??,"I bought this item hoping that it would deodorize my synthetic lawn (about 400-500 sq ft)from all the dog pee. Had a little trouble at first with opening the nozzle which was a little frustrating, but finally got it after a few mins. The stuff smells like simple green and of course immediately after using it the lawn's pee odor wasn't there. However after it dried the odor returned so I'm not sure how effective this stuff really is."
2,Expensive for so short relief,"Considering the cost of this product, I would have expected it eliminate the dog urine and feces oder in the back yard for more than 2 days. Even if it lasts a week, that's still a lot of money to be spending on this type of product."
4,This was a nice gift for my son.,"This was a nice gift for my 13 yr old son. He is a basketball fanatic and we recently moved to Atlanta so, this was perfect. It's not really that easy to zip the ball into the bag but it is fashionable and all the other kids he plays ball with envy his new accessory."
2,Poor Quality and Inconsistent Packaging,"I ordered 8 of these for a program that I did at a local college. Upon opening the boxes, 3 of the ceramic bowls that come with the fondue pot had broken into pieces, and 4 of the packages had missing items (like a few forks, the plate that goes on the bottom, the thing that holds the fuel). I didn't return them because it had been too late (and obviously it wasn't out of my own pocket so I didn't really experience a financial burden) but I really advise people to look elsewhere for fondue pots."
3,A gift for a young adult grand daughter,"In appearance it was less appealing than it could be, although our grand daughter liked it. It was an alright gift."
5,Beautiful,"Worked very well, although we did add some extra water and had to lift it up to add some in between cause it just didn't seem to be working right. But once you find out how much water you need its great!"
4,Great cheap fondue pot; Double boiler is great.,"I did a lot of research on fondue pots before buying one for my wife as a present. I didn't want electric, as we'll only be using it for chocolate and cheese fondues, and nothing that requires high heat(coq au vin, oil, etc). I narrowed my search to this item because of the price, the double boiler, and the reviews.It did not disappoint! Sure, it does need the gel fuel, but that's not really an issue and Amazon has it here for a decent price as well. Beyond that, the ceramic double boiler is heavy, and holds enough fondue for at least two hungry people, definitely more for a party.All in all, this is a great bargain fondue pot. You can spend more and get a nicer pot that will last forever, but as far as budget goes, this is on point."
2,Mis-titled: Extremely Not Challenging!,"I was extremely dissappointed in the riddles in this book (in fact, I am returning it: and I am a charter member of Book-Collectors-Anonymous). For our family and friends, this was easy to the point of disappointment. We own all of the previous I Spy books (not the board books), and they are loaned out constantly. I have even gone as far to buy them for my son's classroom (at the request of the teacher) and the library (again, because they were so popular). For our books, the primary audiences range from Kindergarten to adult. This has no new pictures (which I don't object to), but no substance. Perhaps for the stated age range, these would be great (as a transition from the board books to the more challenging full-size books), but not as an extension of the excellent fore-runners. It is a fun book, but for a different market than the title and the story at the back identify."
3,It's okay,"Not real big on this one. I wish they would come out with new ones. Oh we'll, it works for my four year old"
5,absolutely great,"Fantastic show well worth a watch. The directness and honesty in its story telling is so refreshing many other shows should take note. The characters are all worth putting time into and are very interesting. The style is engrossing and you just want to keep watching. I think it is best to watch in one go without ads, keeps the flow going well.Wanting season 2 on DVD, why is it not out yet..."
5,I really liked this one!,"I bought this on a recommendation, and I am glad I did! The story glides from drama to humor with ease. The characters are well developed and then get better defined with each passing episode.Things get complicated for Huff with every episode, and still he manages to keep a stiff upper lip and forges headlong into every misfortune the writers of the show can come up with. Huff, in a nutshell is a Psychologist whose family is indirectly torn apart by an unfortunate suicide in Huff's office. As you might guess, Huff also plays confessor to his family and friends, which can be awkward, but also highly entertaining.I look forward to the 2nd season someday!Buy this DVD, and then veg for a weekend marathon of Huff."
5,simply the best,This and Weeds are the most entertaining shows on television. Hank Azaria is just incredible and the only person who could play Huff. Oliver Platt is an absolute comic genius and I am madly in love with him. He is in a class by himself and deserves his own 5 stars. The way the whole family interacts is so fascinating and complicated and keeps me wanting more. I have watched the whole first season again just because I can't get enough!!! Bring on season 2.
5,Really great show!,Everything about this show is amazing. It has a cliffhanger of a season finale that will leave you speechless!!
5,Huff is Addictive!,"I started watching this program on Showtime in the middle of its second season and was hooked! As a writer, I find this to be one of the best written shows on all of TV (motion pictures for that matter, too!). It is poignant, funny, painful, and serious. It is so well-acted, that it's hard to see these characters anywhere else. It truly shows the human side of psychiatry along with all our neuroses. This show should have been nominated for an Emmy in every single category!I can't get enough Huff!"
1,Glad This Wasn't A Gift!!,"My order arrived today. I love this show. I've never placed a rating as bad as this. But I will tell you why. This is a 4 disc Season 1. I excitedly opened it and to my surprise, Disc 2 wasn't there. Just an empty space. What if this was going to be a gift??? How embarrassed I would have been! A total fiasco. This probably won't happen but I hope the seller will find me a Disc #2 free of charge & rush mail it to me. I will change the rating if this blunder is made good."
5,Wow! Huff is outstanding!,"Went to the library to find something to watch over the weekend, almost didn't take this home, and am I glad I did. Right up there with Dexter, Damages, Mad Men, etc, but still in a class all it's own. Smart, excellent writing will pull at your heart strings and plenty of dark humor (thanks to Oliver Platt as Huff's attorney) to make you laugh out loud. Huff is believable and extraordinary.Bittersweet drama with lots of laughs. WHERE'S SEASON TWO?"
4,Better than expected! Keeps you on the edge of your seat...,"There are numerous little twists and unexpected turns in this movie. You will root for the family as they try to figure out a way to save themselves from a group of armed ""intruders"". The bad guys have some issues and flaws..which makes this plot feel believable. The well to-do family also has their flaws which will frustrate you when they don't automatically make the right decisions. Really good tense movie."
3,Everybody's a critic....!!!,"It's my fervent hope that someday I'll see a review that cuts right to the chase and tells us if they simply enjoyed the film (or not), lists a couple of reasons for either side, and doesn't insist on picking apart each camera angle, the actors' individual abilities (or lack of same), and the ineptitude of the various directors and writers. Makes me wonder why these film ""experts"" aren't out in Hollywood themselves and writing and directing movies that meet their own obviously higher standards - instead of so arduously ripping into the work of others.With respect to ""Trespass"".... if you enjoy Nicholas Cage's acting in general, you'll probably enjoy this movie. Although it's pretty much an ""average"" movie all the way around, it does have entertainment value. If you're in the mood for something profound, just find another movie to watch tonight.That about covers it!"
3,Entertaining,"It's not art, but it is a movie that entertained me. I don't understand why it didn't do better, I guess if it doesn't have a throw up/puking scene in it or the approved PC agenda scenes (at least one) then a movie doesn't do well."
1,boring,"Let's talk about a terrible low budget movie. 90% of this worthless movie was taped in one room. For the longest hour and half I heard"" if you don't open the safe I will kill your wife"". Now for some men, this would have been music to their ears, ""shoot away"".However, it was just repetitive, boring, and a absolute insult to watch. Please don't rent or buy."
5,TresPass,"For not being advertised very much, that was a terrific movie. A very suspenseful thriller. The price was very good, got a digital copy with the Blu Ray. By the way, the UltraViolet Digital Copy sucks. I want my movies all in one place but the UltraViolet goes to Flixter."
2,Lame,"Not much to say that hasn't been said already. This is just a poorly written, poorly acted and often incoherent mess of a movie. Not really worth the time to rent, let alone own."
2,How did Cage and Kidman get sucked into this ?,"Nicole Kidman and Nicolas Cage are great modern day actors ...... but unless this was a favor owed to somebody or a lost bet ........ how did they get sucked into doing this movie ?Ouch this was bad.Like others have commented, it is like watching an episode of World's Dumbest Criminals.I am not sure if this was supposed to be silly or suspenseful because the whole film comes across very goofy and comical.You can't take anybody seriously.It would be interesting to know the full story of how this film came to be because it seems like something must have gone wrong behind the scenes to create such a mess."
1,$$$$,"This movie is awful. I think Nicolas, and Nicole did this strictly for the money.I'm surprised at Ms. Kidman as she seems to have stayed away from this sort of film. After seeing Mr.Cage's last few films, sadly I'm not surprised.Your typical ""Home Invasion"" thriller.Who puts up the money for this awful stuff? They must make it back on the rentals.Skip this one."
2,Seems like a knock-off,"I love Nicole Kidman and Nicolas Cage, but this movie is awful. I seem to remember a French movie that was VERY similar to this movie.....just about a year ago. I wish I knew the name of the French film. It's much, much better than this."
1,BAD,"Not very good, extremnly predictable. This type of movie has been done to death. Let's steal from the rich people story. i wish i could get my money back."
1,Trespass,"The movie is horrible. The acting is also as bad. I didn't like it at all. It will be unsucessfull, because that Nicholas Cage'movies didn't do very well lately and that NicoleKidman, by now is ""box office poisson"". I wouldn't recomend this movie."
4,"It's all action, baby!","You can't really go wrong with TWO Academy Award winning actors and my new favorite hottie, Cam Gigandet. And don't overlook Dash Mihok -- he's one of my FAVORITE character actors and he's bad-ass in this (seriously, IMDB this guy - he's been in EVERYTHING). It's fantastic seat-gripping action from beginning to end. It's a blast."
1,What an awful movie!!!,"The storyline and the actors sucked! Who would think that with all those top rated actors, that it would be such a bad movie. You were warned."
1,Take a good look....,"This is what a truly awful movie looks like:""Give me the diamonds.""""No.""""Give me the money.""""No.""""Pretty please?""""No.""""I'll shoot her.""""No.""""Okay then, I'll shoot the other one.""""No.""""Okay then I'll stab you with this here syringe I just happened to bring with me on this break in.""""No.""""Awww. Come on. Pretty, pretty please?""Of course this is all followed by and preceded by lots of screaming, yelling, f-bomb dropping & over acting.That pretty much sums up the whole ""Trespass"" experience. I just saved you and hour and a half...."
2,Waste of time,You know those moments where the villain takes forever before killing the good guy and gets owned because of it. Well this movie is like that from the beginning until the end. Don't waste your time. I don't know how Nicole Kidman agreed to do this movie.
2,"Slow, Boring, Dissapointment of a Movie","I was surprised by how bad this movie actually was...but I feel compelled to warn others..it is pretty slow and boring. The negative reviews on here are spot on. Cage plays a wimpy businessman who refuses to open a safe, and Kidman is a meek and 'sexy' wife that a crook has a crush on. Okay...the thieves are pretty clueless and their plan unravels...the action is more psychological than literal. I would rent this or watch it on TV if nothing else was on. Seriously. It is pretty average and boring. Do not waste money on a purchase."
2,"Well, it was only $0.99","The good thing about this movie is that it only cost $0.99 to watch. At 90 minutes, it was slightly over a penny per minute, but it felt a lot longer and a lot cheaper. It was enjoyable in a sense, but has been done better before. Too much action and too many plot twists. The creators ought to have asked themselves, ""How many times does somebody have to die before they stay dead?"""
2,"Bad casting, writing, and acting.","I cannot imagine a movie where N. Kidman and N. Cage blend seamlessly to create a believable world for our entertainment. That being said, this was not only poorly conceived; the acting was lazy and boring. I attempted to look to the set or costume design, or maybe the special effects or story subtext that might give the movie hope, sadly there was nothing.I would like to see this movie executed properly. Clean up the plot slop and give the ending a face lift and of course, some 'better' actors that appear committed to the film. THEN, maybe this could make it worth a Wednesday night rental.Nicole Kidman has the talent to pull off any role she sets her mind to. Ive seen some dynamic and genuinely moving work from her! What happened?Nicolas Cage is PERFECT if the action and story line can carry his 10 lines throughout the film. He just cant carry a film in any context.Watch some PBS and safe yourself a wasted night!"
1,"Dreadful, simply dreadful","Though I understand why Cage apparently makes two movies a month because of his much publicised tax problems, I don't understand why Kidman allowed herself to be in this incredibly dreadful movie.The only good thing I can say about this movie is that I only laid out the funds for a rental. I tried like mad to find some redeeming quality in this movie but was completely unable to find one.This may be the worst movie other than The Wicker Man that Cage has ever been in (and that is saying a LOT). Please save your money and wait for this film to blight regular television. It honestly isn't worth the price of a rental at any price."
2,*Yawn*,"How many times have we seen this home invasion plot? Too many for it to be any different form any of the others. The only reason to watch it is if you are a fan of the actors. It's really, the same movie as all other hostage-in-their-own-home films you've seen since the damn of time. Regurgitated tripe that really doesn't merit a full review, so it's not gonna get one--"
3,How Not To Rob A Rich Man's House,"If you're planning to rob a rich's man's fortress, get organized first. Take your meds at least 1 day before the deed, get sober on that day, don't take drugs or too much alcohol, don't tell too many people about it, and please leave the junkie girlfriend locked up at home (she's leaving her paw-prints everywhere)!This movie ought to be categorized as a COMEDY!I'm giving this a pass grade because of the seemingly intense emotions that the actors displayed in this movie. Nicole Kidman may have saved this movie with her good looks, but she deserves better than to star in a cheap movie like this one.I'm not surprised that those robbers didn't get what they wanted as they were disorganized incompetents. Imagine the ""Home Alone"" robbers wanting to go pro right after snorting some coke!You might as well laugh at:Home Alone: The Complete Collection"
2,Very Mediocre,"The fake velvet touch only enhances how cheap this toolkit is. The pieces are flimsy and light, which makes them feel like they can break at any time. The box they came in is ugly and looks like something you'd buy at a K-mart. The ten dollar metal corkscrews you can buy at the supermarket are better designed than the one you'll find here.If you want a premium wine tool kit I'd recommend looking somewhere else and be prepared to spend $40 or more rather than waste $30 for this one."
5,Olivia is great,I love classic movies and this one is no exception. Wonderful story. I give this one a million stars.
4,Olivia Wins Her First Oscar,"This is Olivia's best and most mature performance since Melanie in ""Gone With te Wind"" (1939) and she elevates this well-crafted soap opera with her passion, steeliness and beauty, having to age from her twenties to her fifties convincingly. It's the story of an unwed mother having to give up her baby son and watch him grow up from afar. Olivia had just struck a great blow for freedom for actors in Hollywood by taking Warner Bros. to the Supreme Court and winning in a bid to stop studios extending actor's contracts beyond the seven year supposed maximum. Hollywood owed Olivia de Havillland a debt of gratitude and her Oscar win was popular but her performace was wide-ranging and top drawer. She was also fine in ""The Dark Mirror"" (1946), ""The Snake Pit"" (1948)(Oscar nominated) and ""The Heiress"" (Second Oscar, 1949) during this most creative period of her career."
4,GREAT SOAPER,"Olivia de Havilland gave a terrific performance in this famed post-war soap; her acting technique, by 1946 had acquired more dimension and she deservedly won an AA. Josephine has a baby by an aviator who gets killed in WWI; she never got a chance to marry him. A memorable scene has Jody's father saying to her (concerning her dilemma): ""I'm not here to judge you - ""I'm here to love you"". Jody gives the child up for adoption and in time she becomes a great success in the cosmetics industry. Of course thoughout the years she has never forgotten the child for a second. Years later, she is still playing the martyr when her son - now full grown - comes to London not knowing who Jody is. At a dance a friend says to Jody ""If you don't tell him, I will"" When the son asks his mother to dance, there ISN'T a dry eye in the house!!"
4,Gut-wrenching melodrama that's actually quite fun.,"Olivia de Havilland is excellent in this movie, which is a bit of a war melodrama and a bit of a woman's picture about the choices available to a pregnant, unmarried girl in a WWI-era small town.As Jodie, a girl who won't just settle for whomever proposes to her, she waits for true love, but, when it comes and goes too soon, she finds herself pregnant. Determined to keep her child and hide the scandal, the baby ends up in the household of one of her closest friends by mistake. Jodie, unfortunately, still is intent on keeping her child.The film spans 20 years, and, as you watch it, you keep waiting for the moment when she'll be able to hold the child she was forced to give away. When the moment truly comes, it's heartbreaking.De Havilland is absolutely terrific. The movie's fun."
5,Excellent!,This season of Bewitched is great to view ! A wonderful entertainment of sweetness and laughter. Enjoy! It's a real delight ! Marvelous ! Can't wait till season Four!
3,Bewitched - The 3rd Season,"I do love Bewitched episodes. However, Season 3 is a little let-down after seeing Seasons 1 and 2, which were spectacular. Also, this is the first season in color - they should have kept it in Black & White, in my opinion."
3,Not the best,"I love Bewitched however, season 3 lacks the charm and wit of the first two. If you are a diehard fan, purchase it."
5,Great Family Show!,The Bewitched Series on DVD is a wonderful family show. We enjoy watching it with our child and know it's a safe alternative to some of the questionable television shows broadcasting in the early evening today. It's like a mug of hot cocoa or bowl of chicken soup - makes for cozy evenings.
5,old goodies and still fun to watch,"I purchased this dvd some weeks ago and it was like old times. My son, who is 14 is now hooked on all these classic movies of yesteryears.This will truely bring back fun memories of good clean comedy."
3,not the best,Most episodes are great but some aren't so funny and Dick York is absent in alot of them.
5,Fabulous! As you would expect!,Bewitched is a timeless classic regardless of the season and makes for a good quick episode for working out or just for laughs.
3,Overpriced,"The prices for these old series are unbelievable. If you don't HAVE to have them on DVD, then watch them for free on Youtube. Yes, they are on Youtube. And google for the YTE episodes website and you will find an entire library of old TV episodes you can watch for free, including Starsky and Hutch, I Dream of Jeannie, All in the Family and lots more."
5,Great product for intermediate player,"Love 'em, love 'em, love 'em! Well balanced, nice and easy to toss. If you're prone to throwing tight groups, you will want to purchase some spinner shafts, as the shafts that came standard did not last very long after a few direct deflections. But then again, many users have a certain shaft they like to use, so buy the shafts you like and give these a try, you won't be dissappointed!"
3,"A prelude to ""In the Aeroplane""","If you are coming to this album after discovering Neutral Milk Hotel through ""In the Aeroplane"" don't expect the same level of music or lyrics, and DO expect some overdone, boring electronic interludes. But there are some gems here- ""Naomi"" is one of my favorite NMH songs, and so is ""Song Against Sex"". There are some NMH classics here, so if you like ""In the Aeroplane"" you won't be dissapointed, but I can't reccomend it to someone who hasn't tried their 2nd album yet."
3,Stands out but doesn't accomplish enough,"Limited but passionate debut from the alt-folksters might not have all the cathartic power and indie-might their acclaimed follow up possessed, but was a good start indicating the abrasive acoustic direction to expect. Too many songs just seem to embellish a simple chord progression to make the songwriting noteworthy, but these are one of those bands that thrive off of making simple transitions sound far more urgent and truthful then they ought."
4,decent,"Sometimes I love these guys and other times they really get on my nerves. Overall, I would say this is a great album. Still, I usually get through about 5 songs before I need to turn it off. Worth a listen if you are into that late 90's hyped up 60's thing."
2,"Instrumentally sound, lacks creative vocals","I think the music on this disc is great. Its melodies are thick and powerful and groovy. I find the singing to be nothing more than a whiny voice without much range, and unfortunately it dominates the music. Like a lot of pop, too much of the song contains vocals, as if the band is afraid the music would fail if the singing stops.One of the problems with reading online reviews is usually only people who love the music take the time to review it. So here's a review from someone who thinks it's average."
3,"Not as powerful, but worth checking out","I purchased On Avery Island after hearing and loving In an Aeroplane over the Sea. While On Avery Island doesn't measure up to the album from Neutral Milk Hotel that followed, I'm glad I got it and enjoy several tracks from it."
5,90 percent,"This album is good. If you like the beauty of AEROPLANE, then you may be disappointed. But this is my 6th favorite album. the emotion isn't necessarily more or less raw, it just isn't wrapped as nice. the instrumentals are more droning noisejams than the ones on aeroplane. I like it."
4,A Good Album by a Good Artist,"Neutral Milk Hotel delivers a fabulous album with On Avery Island. The album includes fast upbeat tracks like ""Song Against Sex"" and ""Gardenhead"" to slower, but equally good ones, like the best song on the album, ""Naomi."" This is a great album, but I prefer NMH's second album, In the Aeroplane Over the Sea."
3,"Fun to read, but take with a grain of salt.","This book is quite informative in addressing many different Goddess stories and legends from many different cultures in a brief, fun-to-read format but the historical information the author provides seems rather vague and incomplete. It proves to be an entertaining indulgence, nonetheless. However, if you want to address the worship of the Goddess in a more practical and educational manner, I would suggest looking elsewhere. There is some good advice here for beginners and those who wish to use the book as a quick-reference guide or as a possible overview, but I wouldn't use this book for any in-depth studies of the craft. Also, the repetitive spelling errors can become quite annoying."
2,Nothing that hasn't been done better elsewhere,"This book might -- MIGHT -- be of use to the beginner or the casual practitioner, but anyone who has been involved in paganism or wicca for any length of time will not find much here that hasn't been covered elsewhere. And, I am sorry to say, covered in more depth. The illustrations are nice, though, and for someone who is not very familiar with wicca or paganism this might be helpful, but ONLY as a start down the path. If you're further on down the Way, there's not much of any interest here, sad to say. And what is it with Llewellyn and spelling errors? This book is loaded down with them. People, Microsoft Word includes a spellcheck function - USE IT."
2,Found it difficult to read,"I really enjoyed DJ Conway's ""Moon Magick"" book and thought that this one would be just as fulfilling. The author didn't seem to do a lot of research and if she did it didn't seem to come through in her writing. I found that a lot of the work was inconsistent and a lot of times she wrote about goddess myths within a few words instead of investing the time to right a full report and complete body of their stories. To my knowledge some of the things she wrote weren't even correct but I'm not completely sure since she wrote about so many Goddesses I wouldn't know where to start. Honestly I just wish she had taken the time to write about a few important Goddesses and thoroughly research their archetype instead of mashed a lifetime's worth of information into a sentence or two. I don't recommend this for anyone who would want to know more about the Goddess, I wish I did have a good suggestion though."
3,A Decent Reference Guide,"I began this book with high hopes but alas, by the end, was a tad dejected. So I did the Lemon=Lemonaide thing. I grabbed my trusty high-lighter and went to town. To the authors credit, Maiden, Mother and Crone does give us bits of information on a wide range of religious cultures, giving us a look at the Goddess, her functions and her followers from every continent. This book has a million footnotes, most of which lead you to an author and title of some reference book, so I walked away with lots of suggested reading. Other than that, I'm afraid this one has little depth and is now in my Donate-to-the-Library pile."
3,Not at all what I expected,"When I saw the title of the book and read the editor's synopsis, I thought it would be a comprehensive overview of the Triple Goddess aspects. Boy, was I sorely disappointed! The overviews of the three Goddess aspects were very brief and all of the information on the world Goddess myths without a more thorough overview of the Goddess aspects wasn't very helpful. When God was a Woman by Merlin Stone does a much better job of explaining the prevalence and then decline of the Goddess."
2,Beginning of the softening of their sound.,"This came out in 1995. Indoor living, from 1997 was their last of 5 great albums along with indicental music, foolish, no pocky for kitty and mouth to mouth. This is the beginning of the slide to a generally more gentle sound. They got declawed a bit. Worse, they didn't write any of the real together, soaring, 2 guitar power songs here that they did on those 5 albums. I'm glad I got virtually all their records. Who knows, in 10 years when I'm 61 maybe I'll be more into this and their other late 90's/2000's records, less fast, less powerful. Though, on listening to this, none of the songs hit that great musical groove that 5 to 11 of their songs do on those 5 great albums. Still, much better than a poke in the eye. chrisbct@hotmail.com"
1,Not like they used to be,"This is a review of the comb itself not the vendor who sold it to me. I have no quarrel with them.I have used this type of comb for many years prior. I have psoriasis and this comb was an excellent aid in keeping the scalp plaques and flakes diminished. I bought two new combs becuase I had lost my previous one. The previous one had lasted me for several years with an occasional tooth breaking off.The new combs I ordered were a major disappointment. With the first use, the teeth of the comb started to bend and distort permanently out of shape. The comb became useless after the first use. I tried the second comb hoping the problem with the first was an anomaly. It was not, the second comb suffered the same problem with the first use. Perhaps these combs came from an overall bad batch. I will have to think twice about purchasing thes again."
1,does not work,"I cant figure out why just yet, but it does not charge my phone. When I plug it in my phone appears to take a charge but it just doesn't. Plus, when it is plugged in, the screen locks up rendering my phone useless. And its not my phone - every phone I have tried it on does the same thing..."
2,charger,"As it turned out it was the wrong charger, so it was no good to me.Maybe I will go be to Amazon and see if there is the right charger for my phone."
1,Arrived broken,This phone charger came right out of the box NOT working. Even if it is only 5 bucks don't waste your money buying something that doesn't work
1,Utter Crap,This sucked. I should have known spending less than a dollar on this thing that it would work. I plugged it in once worked charged it took a call and unplugged it after that it wouldn't charge my phone again. Not worth the S&H for the return.
1,Never Worked,"As a common complaint by others, mine never worked with my Razr 3. And for the price, it wasn't worth returning it."
1,charger sucks,"the charger does not work with my razor phone. plugs in okay, but I can never get it to start charging my phone."
1,I'm one unlucky person.,"For most people, this works perfectly fine. For some, it doesn't charge, or the phone doesn't even recognize it. I happened to be the latter one. It tells me Unable to charge. Well, it knows something is in the port, but not working. Great.It's a genuine Motorola product, and I expected more. Or am I expecting too much if I want a phone charger to actually charge?"
2,Good product,"The charger arrived just as expected, and it works great. It was very cheap, at only a dollar. However, with shipping and handling, the price was $10.00! I feel deceived, because the product is a lot more expensive then it seems. It should not cost that much to ship a tiny charger."
5,Prompt Delivery,Definitely cheaper than buying a new phone. We were not sure if there was phone problem or charger problem. This was an w=inexpensive way to find out.
3,"works, but charges really slow.","it charges slowly.and if the battery is completely dead, for some reason it doesn't work. it has to be on, and with some battery for it to work fine."
2,Bought 5 - 4 broke,"The shipping cost was 10x the amount for the adaptors. I bought 5 and although they were marked as Motorola chargers 4 out of 5 broke and they were pretty much disposable. I was planning on giving some away as spares to friends and family, but after the first 2 broke I decided to keep them all vs., giving junk out to people I care about."
4,Review of Motorola Mini USB Travel Charger,"I am pleased with the product, packaging, and shipping. I wish that I had known that the phone came with this exact charger prior to purchase and that the receipt contained more detail for company records."
4,Second one working well,"I purchased this charger from AccessoryOne, and after I received it I found it did not work. I sent an email to AccessoaryOne to complain about it, then they sent me another charger without requiring me to return the bad one. The second one works great."
1,Didn't really work,"When i got it and plugged it into my phone, it didn't even work. I thought even at 85 cents, something would work."
1,Does not work for Razr V3,"Does not work, microsoft wizard keeps asking for a software CD. Unable to load, emails to seller for drivers or software are fruitless no response. Good thing it didn't cost too much!"
5,USB Wall Charger for Motorola Phones,These take a licking and keep on ticking.What more can I say about a great product that never lets me down.
2,Wrong connection,"I couldn't use it with my phone, but for the cheap price, I could just throw it away. Picture was too small to truly evaluate."
1,Does not work,"I bought this for charging my Motorola RAZR while at work and it does not work. I plug it in and the phone registers that the charger is attached but hours later my phone is still not charged. When I use the charger that came with my phone it charges the phone in less than two hours so I know there is something wrong with this one. I personally am very unhappy with this purchase and cannot recommend it.UPDATE: I ordered a travel charger directly from my cell phone company and, while it looks exactly like the one I ordered via Amazon, it performs 100% better - it charges my phone in about 90 minutes. So I now know for sure that this one is defective. 85 cents might sound appealing, but if it ends up in the landfill then it's nothing but junk."
1,DOA twice,"Item was DOA, I contacted Supplier and they sent me another unit, it too was DOA, a refund was promptly issued."
1,"product not as described, customer service blows!","Searched for ""droid 3 chargers"" when making my purchase. This was the first product to pop up, had decent reviews, and was cheap. I purchased 3. The product arrived on time. HOWEVER this product does NOT fit our droid 3 phones. I contacted customer service over the course of 9 times. No results in replacement, return or refund. Contactd by phone and w/in the first 2 min of the convo the F-bomb was dropped twice. Very offensive and unprofessional. Needles to say, I have 3 chargers that dont fit any of my phones. Anyone wanna trade?"
1,frustrating,The product did not work. Would not charge my phone. I returned it and the replacement did NOT WORK! Beware.
1,very disappointed,The product is not what was described. I received the very old chargers that are not used for devices including motorola phones that have been made in the last 4 years. BUY AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!!
5,"Great price, speedy delivery",My cell phone is about 3 years old so it's next to impossible to find accessories for it in a Radioshack or any of those types of stores so when my charger broke I thought I was out of luck. [...] it was here in an expedient fashion are bonuses. I've had the charger almost a month now and I couldn't be happier.
3,Not suitable for all Moto phones,"I bought this item for a Moto Z9n . I need an special attachment in order to use it , therefore will spend more than if bought it from ATT"
4,it works,"i got it to charge my 2GB sanza clip. i had previously used the usb connection from my computer, but it took too long to fully charge. when i received this product i was unsure if it would work. i plugged it in and the display lights came on briefly then it went blank. i had read that it was only charging when the lights were on. i left it plugged in and to my amazement, it did indeed charge the mp3 player that i had. after 10 hours of charging, it was fully charged. you can't beat the charger for value."
1,Waste of Money,Doesn't work not worth returning. I'm just throwing it away. Waste of time and money. Spend a little more money and get on that works.
1,I HATE THIS CHARGER!!!!!!!!!!!,This is the second one that went down in two weeks. I'm a dee dee dee for buying this again! Somebody needs to tell the slave labor in China to stop making JUNK!!
4,The Real Deal.... Slightly Used,"Typical Motorola adapter, OEM, works as advertised. Couldn't beat the price (it was around $ 5.00 shipped). The only issue I have is that the retailer stated ""Retail Packaging"" and ""New"" in the product description. It was very apparent that it was a used adapter when it showed up at my house. It was shipped inside a clear plastic bag (no retail hanging card), and the cord had been re-wrapped.Can't really complain as the price was right. It would just be nice if the retailer was a little more up-front about whether they are selling used stuff or not.After I wrote this, I double-checked the product description and it very clearly states that it is a ""New"" product and has ""Retail Packaging"". I guess the people in the retailer's shipping department didn't get the word. If I had paid over $ 5 for this I'd be a little upset."
1,Does not work with Droid Razr,"I ordered this for my Droid Razr. It does not fit, so I am guessing this is for an old Razer phone (assuming there are any still in use)."
1,Not happy at all,"I am giving this company a 1 star raing becuse is the lowest that I can give, there should be a no star rating. I ordered 2 of these Motorola mini USB wall chargers, Sold by: UnlockedCellPhoneKings. The price was too good to be true. I should have known better. When I received them they were not Motorola Mini USB Wall Charger for Motorola Phones, they were actually Verizon mini USB CAR CHARGERS, not what I wanted at all. I called and was told that the correct chargers would be sent to me. When I got them, again they were the wrong item. I give up! For $1.02 they aren't worth going through the trouble to call and complain again. I will never do business with this company again."
2,Mini USB end becomes loose after multiple uses,"When this charger worked with my Motorola Droid 2, it worked great. But I have had two of these chargers, and the mini USB end became loose with both of them after many uses. The wires are too flimsy and need to be better reinforced."
1,wrong charger,They are not the ones for my phone and due to a computer problem mistakenly got 3. I don't have a need for any of them. Can't figure how to return.
1,Does not fit my RAZR...,Are you kidding me?... This was not the correct charger ordered. I'm very disappointed with this product. I will be contacting them. I put 1 star only because I had too in order for my review to come out.
1,Wall N Car charger,I was unhappy with both the wall and car charger because neither of them would fit my motorola barrage because the end was to large to plug into the phone piece. Tried to get them to exchange them but they were not sure what a barrage phone was. They are trying to make a exchange but have not as yet. Had to buy the chargers from someone else.
3,just like the original,This charger is identical to the original charger that came with my phone and both functioned perfectly until the original failed after less than 2 years.
5,great usb charger,"Great portable charger. Will quickly recharge most USB chargeable device not just Motorola. Very compact with folding plug, great for traveling and charging BB, PDA, phone, MP3 player, etc."
1,This product did not work at all and screwed my phone up.,"This product did not work at all and screwed my phone up. Everything else I ordered was fine.Thats all,Toodles"
1,Quit After Two Months,"I bought this a few months ago, worked fine at first, though it was harder to plug into my phone than the one that came with the phone. Then it quit altogether after about 2 months. I now doubt that this charger is actually made by Motorola."
2,It is a dirty used item,"The detail description does not say this is a used one. The worst thing is not it is a used item, but it is very dirty. The vendor should at least clean it."
5,Works good but shaped differently,"The product works just fine. However, the delivered product is a different shape than the one in the picture and actually works better. The one pictured inserts vertically, but the delivered unit inserts horizontally in the wall outlet which works better for me."
1,doesn't work,"I ordered three of these chargers. The items received did not match what was ordered, Two of the three chargers did not work."
1,Doesn't Work!,"As soon as the charger came in the mail, it had failed to charge my phone. I had ordered 2 other chargers with it as well which both also did not work, I am very displeased with the results"
1,Doesn't work,"It looks like I was one of the unlucky ones that received a charger that just doesn't work. Yeah, they have it for a good price, but apparently it's hit and miss. You might want to just fork over the dough for a charger you know will do the job (or at least one that's easily returnable if it doesn't)."
2,"bought two, one of them didn't work","I figured you can't go wrong with this price, so I bought one for my wife & one for me. One of them never charged our phone, confirming negative experiences of other reviewers.The item I got also looks different than the picture in shape. What's depicted is the original ""flat"" charger where the prongs fold, but what I got is a more boxy transformer with non-retracting prongs. Not as travel friendly."
5,great quality,i was really happy with the charger that i bought. especially the fact that i payed a lot less than having to but it from the direct retailer.thanks amazon.
4,Works perfectly,"I needed a new phone charger because mine wouldn't work anymore. The only problem I have with it is the giant box you stick on your outlet. It still works perfectly well, and if you need an inexpensive phone charger that charges through a mini usb port, I would recommend this product."
1,Don't waste your money.,The charger stopped working after a few weeks. I contacted Bargain Cell and never received a response. Don't waste your money.
3,charger,It will charge the battery. It can not cook me breaskfast. So it does what it was made to do.
1,Never delivered!,"I already owned one of these chargers and really liked it; especially the long cord. I would've enjoyed this one too...had it ever arrived! I ordered it and forgot about it, and when I checked back later it had been declared delivered but it had never showed up at my house!"
1,double-check your model,"I can't comment on the quality of the product itself, but I thought I'd post this as an FYI for anybody else who's about to make the same mistake I did. I have a Droid 2, and this came up in the Amazon search as a charger. However, the Droid 2 takes a micro-USB plug, not a mini-USB plug. It's not worth the $3 return shipping for a $5 refund, but hey, at least it was cheap."
5,Excellent and priced beautifully!,"Had guests visiting who had forgotten charger for their cell phone.Ordered this to fill the need, as it was priced so wonderfully.Shipped very promptly, worked as specified."
4,great!,I recv'd the product good & normal. It works well---normal! There's no misshaps on this prod.Thanks
1,Motorrola Wall Charger,It's hard to review something that I haven't even gotten ... I ordered this product several weeks ago and never got it nor did I get a response from AMAZON on the status of my order ... I guess just like the Motorola RAZR that I ordered from AMAZON that was sent by some obscure company that is on the market itself I APPEAR TO BE JUST SCREWED OUT OF MY MONEY ...
1,Make sure yours works 100%,My charger has been iffy since I got it. I didn't bother to send it back for an exchange and should have. Make sure your charger really works! Mine must have a loose connection. It's stopped working entirely and I'm too late for a refund or exchange.
4,Works perfectly and good price!,It works perfectly for me and you can not beat the price. Fast delivery too. No complaints from me.Good buy!!!
1,? is Seller doing a bait & Switch,I specifically made sure that the Motorola Charger was the same. The picture was exactly the mini charger I needed. The charger sent was not the same as shown. The cost of postage is more then the items cost.
2,Intermittent Connection,This charger worked fine for a while but now it has a bad connection somewhere inside. I have to jiggle the body of it around until a good connection is produced. The problem is not the wall outlet -- this happens in any outlet in any building.
4,good purchase but not 100% as described,"It works, but it's not the same one pictured in the posting. It's motorola charger and is compact, but the plugs don't fold down as shown in the picture. Either way, it's a good deal for the price so I'm happy. Delivery was quick."
5,Very good,It does exactly what it should do and it is a great price. I know some other posts commented on the length of the cord. I think it is more than sufficient.
3,You people are expecting too much,"What do you expect...it's a single. its how singles are...it has the song, the video and another track.you don't have to buy it. people buy them to collect them...and becuase also these are official and when there is a song on it such as say a HTEP song or a remix. it's the the official release of that un released song. of course people rip them and put them on the net...so it doesn't seem that rare. but alot of the live tracks are firstly released on these singles. of course some arn't...but thats how singles are.there also meant for people who wan't a video or don't know the band that much but heard a certain song before, so they buy the single.i collect them and if i need a video i'll buy them. jeee, you people are harsh"
1,This is retarded,"Why in the heck, would they try to get ppl to buy a c-d with 3 songs on it. let alone, you only need to get hybrid theory and meteora for the total amount of songs they have done! why waste the money???"
2,Falls Apart,"This single really bites, good song but not meant to be a single i'm glad they didn't air this on tv."
3,Wodney Wat Weview,I found this book to be quiet interesting. It was interesting because it taught an important lesson in a funny way. it taught to never be too serious.
4,Good things about Hoowas for Wodney Wat,"I like this book because it talks about apronunciation ,and how some people can't pronounce some letters or word.This doesn't mean that the're dumb or anything like tha and that sometimes the person you think is the smartest it's really the one that should learn to do simple things like listen."
5,children's book,This is a very clever and adorable book--but the humor in it probably requires about a 4 or 5 year old audience. Fun for the adult 'weading' the book. :)
5,Hooway!,"Wonderful! Delightful! Marvelous! Well, you get the idea--there aren't enough adjectives to do this book justice. The author of many wonderful titles, Lester has hit a grand-slam this time. It is sheer delight to read outloud. Buy it for every child you know, and buy one for yourself while you're at it."
3,I disagree with the ratings posted,"This book was recommended to me, as my six year old replaces his 'R' sounds with the 'W' sound. I read it myself before giving it to him, and then decided to not let him read it. I did this because, even with his struggles with speech, my son does not feel badly about his difficulties and his classmates and friends do not tease him. I was afraid he would put himself too much in Rodney's place and feel ashamed and embarassed.Although the bully was a force to be dealt with, the idea that, simply through the process of the game, she was allowed to wander away from the school and was never seen again, seemed a bit frightening to me. Where were the adults who should have helped her manage her inappropriate actions? Where did she go? Do kids have that much magical power to make a problem 'disappear' rather than resolving it?"
5,A weally gweat wead!,"Hooway for Wodney Wat will have you, and your kids, laughing out loud. Poor Wodney the Wat can't say his R's, and due to the teasing of other ""wodents"" in his class, spends most of his time hiding in his jacket. Enter Camilla Capybara, the newest, biggest, smartest and definitely meanest rodent at PS 142 Elementary School for Rodents. Rodney becomes a hero when his speech impediment ends up helping him rid himself and his classmates of Camilla's bullying - in a very humorous way. Text and pictures combine for a book your kids will ask for again and again -- and you actually won't mind."
3,Wodney Wat Review,I found this book to be quiet interesting. It taught a funny moral which is: never take things too seriously.
5,charming story,"This is just really sweet and funny. Sure, it teaches a lesson, but it's never heavyhanded or moralistic about it. The story and the engaging characters are what stand out, and the main character's speech impediment makes it fun to read out loud to a child."
1,terrible moral,"I took this book out of the library because my child is having some issues with bullying and realize this story is awful for a children's book. The moral of the story is not about how bullying is hurtful to others, but instead approaches the problem by having the person being bullied (Wodney) bully someone else in a very tricky way. These kind of books should never be published and really have the potential to invoke really distasteful behavior."
1,Terrible Lesson!,"My son has a speech impediment, and this book was recommended to me because of it.However, the lesson of this book is basically, ""If the kids pick on you because of something, find someone else who deserves to be picked on and earn your bully's respect.""Terrible Lesson!"
5,"Fantastic book for preschooler learning to say ""R""","A teacher friend suggested this book for our little boy who is having trouble saying his ""r"" sounds. He doesn't completely understand the humor in the story (he's only three) but we love it! He loves the delightful illustrations. I know this is a book he will grow into and one we will read again and again."
4,Wodney Wat Review,This is one of my favorite children's books. It is interesting because Helen Lester uses a fictional story to describe bullies. Wodney uses his speaking disability to make Camilla seem like she has lost her mind. Wodney ends up saving everyone from Camilla when he tells them to take a rest. Since Camilla doesn't know Wodney is not able to say his r's she begins to walk west. The illustrations in the book are well drawn and show movement in them.
5,VERY FUN AND GREAT ART,A GREAT BOOK for children of all ages (2 and older)!! Has a great encouraging lesson of selfconfidence and purpose too. The art work is funny and captivating.
5,Bullying can be overcome.,Hooway for Wodney WatThis is a perfect book for teaching and explaining the consequences of bullying. Tender and comforting story!
1,Not a Fan...,"I bought this book to read with my son, who's 5. I thought it would be about overcoming bullies. It was, but I didn't like the message. Basically the only reason Rodney gains confidence & becomes a 'hero' is because he makes the class laugh at another class bully so that she runs away. Message: if you're getting picked on, you should gain acceptance from those bullies by picking on someone else. Really? It could have been such a different & better lesson. Not keeping this book."
5,wodney the wat,"Wodney is little rat that cant pronounce the letter r.But over all he is and always minds his own bisness,when he goes to school the kids always laugh at him and make fun of him.So the only reason why i chose this book was because it was funny and it tought me to never be mean to someone before i get to know them.Also i thought it should have won an award,so if you read this youll know what iam talking about."
4,It covers a variety of content areas!,"At first glance, one might think that this is a book solely meant for entertainment. However, after the initial reading, one discovers that the text can provide the primary/elementary child with instruction in a variety of skills: animal identification, phonemic awareness, rhyme, as well as social skills like acceptance, tolerance, cooperation, and handling bullies, all character development skills so necessary in today's world.And, besides that, it's a fun read!"
1,Report,I had to read this for a book report. It wasn't too bad but it was boring. I don't like biographies
5,Girl Sluth Nancy Drew and the Women Who Created Her,"For all you Nancy Drew lovers! This book will surprise and delight you.Many interesting facts. This book really tells a very unique story, about a very unique and gentle man...Edward Stratemeyer. Carolyn Keene is actually 3 different women! Bet 'cha didn't know that!! You will enjoy this book."
4,Check the facts,"Girl Sleuth is a must-read especially for the over-50 Nancy Drew fan. Rehak's research is remarkable. However, on p. 47, Rehak has Mildred Augustine headed west to the University of Iowa from her hometown of Ladora, Iowa. She would have headed east. I have been teaching 30 years in the school district that now includes students from the town of Ladora and have my own degree from Iowa. I've traveled Highway 6 between Ladora and Iowa City many, many times.Marcia NillesWhat Cheer IA"
2,disappointing,"Though I was a huge Nancy Drew fan as a kid, I was rather underwhelmed by this book. I thought the writing was poor and the book as a whole was pretty boring."
3,The Magic of Herbs in Daily Living,"I found the book interesting but his other works were much better. I did find things I can use, but the content was not as interesting as his other book."
2,dissapointed,I brought this thinking bubble trouble was the episode i was looking for but i was dissapointed when it wasnt it was a remake of all gummed up which was what i was looking for. So if all gummed up is what your looking for dont bother with this one!
5,What can you say?,These are the stooges and they are awesome. There's some funny stuff on this DVD. It's well worth it. Get 'em while you can!
5,I love this book,I am in seminary studying for a ThD. This book is well written and gives the right dates and precise times of events in the Bible.
2,unsure...,"this is a collection of short stories focusing on the great erea of kink. the problem i had with the book is that the stories were so damned short that when i started getting interested, they would end. the author sacraficed quality for quantity.while the story concepts were hot, he didn't develop them and they had no life of their own. it was like a mc donalds cheeseburger versus a steakburger. the concepts were great, just WAY too short to be developed or enjoyed."
4,How much rubber do you like?,"(...) the 16 stories here may satisfy you. There is a lot of variety here in terms of what types of objects are rubber, how they are used, and where they are used. The stories are primarily in first person but equally split between bottom and top view. However, if your interest in rubber is specific whether than means a particular object or amount of rubber, you may be disappointed in the book. For example, my slave loves rubber but only covering most of the body, only black, etc, and he was not impressed by the book."
4,Clever Lyrics and and Jangly Guitars,"What I think of when I hear this album is a hot summer day in north Jersey. The best songs on this album are ""Good Luck Line"" and ""Stumble Up the Stairs,"" but the rest of the album has a great, well-produced quality to it. The lyrics are also clever without being pedantic, and the songs are full of pop-hooks which stick in your mind like any good pop song.Spent are in some ways similar to label-mates Magnetic Fields, without the dark melancholy and unusal synth arrangements. They are more like your traditional guitar-based rock band, playing to a college audience at the local pub, than the eccentric Stephin Merritt.I'm sad to hear that Spent aren't continuing this project, as this collection of songs shows they have a knack for songwriting and can pull off great pop songs.There are a few songs which drone on without seeming to go anywhere, such as ""Until We Have Enough,"" and for this reason, the album only gets 4 stars."
4,lots of fun,"My son loves his Mack truck. Just like the real thing. Could see that it would not withstand too much heavy handling, but is serving the purpose for real earthworks play along with his CAT excavator for now in his real world!!."
3,Cool looking truck,Nice toy. Wish it was a little stronger. My son likes playing with it in the sand. Overall I am satisfied.
3,"Good for static display yes. Durable for sandbox play, no.","Bruder has a superb eye for detail in the creation of this truck, which is what attracted me to it as a collector of diecast and plastic models. For me the features like opening doors and adjustable mirrors are great. But I purchased the Bruder Mack dump truck for static display. Does it have the durability to stand up long term to heavy duty construction jobs with a 6 year old as the foreman of his sandbox construction site? I rather doubt it. The all steel construction toys of old lasted for years and many are now valuable as collectibles because they survived so long. This toy looks great and could probably manage carpet play at Grandma's house but that is going to be about it. However if you buy a Bruder product knowing these things going in as I have, then I think a person will be happy with the product."
3,Handsome but not hardy,"Shiny & very handsome; what I always wanted as a kid but never got. However, swiveling doors & mirrors are very flimsy plastic, had to be reworked to open easily & are too delicate for 4 or 5 yr. old. Must yank on truck bed to open. Tires & body sturdy but more suitable for indoor play. Front wheels do not turn so truck has to be skidded around curves. Definitely not for child who likes to ride on or crash his trucks. A bit smaller than advertised: 20"" L, 6.75"" W, 9"" Ht. Too bad it isn't made out of metal.Overall more luxurious than practical."
3,Beautiful toy but no great way to push it!,"I bought this for my son on his third birthday. He instantly loved it right out of the box (what kid wouldn't). As it was raining, he played indoors with it all day. It held up well to his play, but he's very gentle with it. Great movement + realistic = kid win.However, there are two flaws to this truck. First, like everyone states, the mirrors are flimsy. I was scared to move them into their open position, as they felt ready to snap off.Second, this truck is not easy to push around in grass or in the sand box. The engine casing is designed to flip forward to reveal the engine. It is held shut on either side by tiny rubber straps that are looped over tiny tabs. Unfortunately, other than the engine casing, there is no great place for little (or big) hands to push this guy around. As a result, the tiny bands are overwhelmed and the casing flips open again and again."
3,Ok,"Son really likes it, but everything is plastic and kind of cheap. I will expect the doors to be ripped off soon."
5,Dump truck,The Bruder Mack Granite Dump Truck look's just like the real thing a great Christmas Present for my Grandson he loved it.
1,missing parts,"I ordered this dump truck for my grandsons for Christmas. It arrived the friday before and I wrapped. However, when the boys opened and went to play there was a part missing leaving the truck unable to what it was suppose to -dump. I called and was very quickly given instructions for returning thru UPS. I spoke with a young lady named Tessa who was very polite and helpful. Had the truck been in working order two little boys would be very busy. It is a good looking truck. Would be more stars but due to being inoperable only 1."
5,Bruder trucks rock,"We have purchased a lot of trucks over the past few years, and Bruder trucks really are the best. They are durable and heavy and a good size for 3-+ years. We like them because they are very functional and my son loves to play with garbage trucks that actually work. Shipping from Amazon was the fastest and very reliable. We found the best pricing at Amazon.............good luck to all u truck fans"
5,Great Truck for young children,"Well built, reall looking, does everything you'd want. Child is very happy with it. Always playing with it. Smiles all around."
1,Christmas,Received the wrong item ans it's been almost 2 weeks since it was picked up and I still haven't received my refund. This was a Christmas gift for my step father and I haven't been able to give it too him. You ruined Christmas.
2,This movie sucked,"Upfront, I'll admit that I've only watched about half this movie (till the mock trial of the schoolgirl) until I shut it off. There are two story lines running throughout the film, one having to do with a planned heist of a van carrying special blank paper from the government mint used in currency production, and the other involving a social outcast boy at a private school. The storylines have almost nothing to do with each other (at least till the half way point where I stopped) and the child acting is bad.I usually love espionage and gangster movies, but I would not recommend this film to others."
2,HB3 not PC3,Illustration of this item is is a Bosch PC3 (dark mandrel attached) but item sent was a Bosch HB3 (plain white cutter).
2,Return of Jafar:HORRIBLE :: King of Thieves: Average,"I think as a kid....it really didn't matter to us much whether it was original or sequel...BUT...i recently rented the Return of Jafar to see it again...it was ASTONISHING....i've never seen anything so horrible except maybe for ""Belle's Magical Castle"".....this sequel is absolutely appalling....the visuals are horrible and just...only suitable for little kids.BADBADHorrible tribute to Aladdin....he didn't even seem like Aladdin anymore...and Jasmine and Sultan...what happened to them...not to mention...the Genie voice over was so bad...King of Thieves was quite okay. I have a copy of it, actually. But, it's nothing special and just a normal Disney sequel. The songs are decent but compares nothing to what Alan Menken and Howard Ashman/ Tim Rice wrote. Owell, at least Robin Williams was back as the Genie so that was nice.As much as i LOVE the ORIGINAL Aladdin....i have to give this a bad rating....Return of Jafar is just too bad."
5,The best disney movies there are and ever will be!!,"aladdin has always been my fav. growing up and still is, i love jefar and iago there the best, they make it interesting to watch and the genie is hilarious!! robin williams is the best for the voice, thank you for doing the voice, you did awsome!!!"
5,Aladdin 2 & 3 collection,My grandson loved the 1st Aladdin movie and had seen these two at a friend's. He plays them over and over. The whole family can sing all the songs.
3,Three Stars Because...,...they were two brilliant films with real good plot lines and amazing songs. Neither of them were quite as good as the first one but they were close enough.
5,Great addition to your library,"Not a whole lot to say other than if you love modern American literature, this is a tome to add to your collection. The editors selected a bit of adventure, comedy, and tragedy from a wide range of authors. Something for everyone, and a nice value; if you're a reader, get a copy."
2,"Recommended for small, Christian, male support groups.","This book is a short guide for men who are seeking to participate in male, Christian support/mentoring groups. This book provides a very structured format for group meetings. I would not recommend this book to readers with any other purpose. It is instead a good starter guide for the aforementioned audience."
1,Save your money,"I am glad that my wife and I borrowed this from the library instead of spending any money on it. 15 minutes of clips edited together in a mish mash and then 45 minutes of other content. The quality is poor - I suppose if you are a addict it is a ""must"" but this clip show is almost an insult to the series.The best production value on the tape was the nicely produced affiliate reel at the end where they showed flubs and outtakes of other shows (not trek) in black and white. The rest. Just a clip show, and labeling it Star Trek Bloopers might as well be false advertising.15 minutes of Star Trek piece togethers ... gags by the editor as well as real bloopers. That's the only trek connection.CAUTION: Tape contains nudity (non-trek)."
1,"Impossible! Just A.W.F.U.L.! (ZERO STARS, IF POSSIBLE!)","I should have paid more attention to the terrible reviews on line here about this mess, but thought to my self, ""How bad can it be?"" Well, folks, it's really bad. There are perhaps 30 minutes or less of really poorly copied Star Trek episode out-takes that are truly execreable in viewing quality. Not only that, but even if they were perfectly viewable, they wouldn't be very funny. Poorly edited, bad sound, bad everything. From reading the Star Trek books by Shatner, I had really wanted to see this video, but my disappointment was really unbounded. The rest of the video consists of out-takes from a number of old TV shows, none of which would have made it to the Ed McMahon/Dick Clark show. Save your money. Really!"
2,Star Trek Bloopers,Very disappointed in this video. It is not worth the money. Looks like someone pieced together very old films that were worn out. It was not what I expected and I would highly recommend people do not waste their money.
1,"Poor video quality, few funny outtakes and much cursing","As a Trek fan, I was very disappointed with this video. I was expecting true Trek bloopers, instead, the film looks like an amatuer 8mm, very dark, and grainy. I counted only 2 times my family laughed at any of the Trek bloopers and most of the time, we looked at each other in dismay. The bulk of the tape is not Trek Bloopers at all, but outtakes from other 60's and 70's shows. While these were much better quality (and funnier) than the Trek bloopers, there was still a lot of off color language (G.. D..., S..., H..., and such) and one nude scene. This video is definitely not family material."
3,Not For Everyone,"Of COURSE it looks and sounds bad! It is true - these were eventually rejected and trashed, folks. I saw them over 15 years ago, and the quality was just as bad then. This isn't a video for most people, it's for us die-hard TOS fans who love trivia and oddities concerning the series. If you are willing to accept it for what it is, it is certainly watchable and actually quite humorous. I guess we should be thankful that Mr. Roddenberry decided to save them in the first place, no matter how they were mistreated later on. As far as I know, these are the ONLY bloopers of TOS in existence."
1,"Heavily compressed, full of artifacting!","This disc is so compressed, that the movements look like painted animation! If Platinun Disc would release these as two to a disc, they would look much better. Don't bother with this 4-movie DVD, you can not watch it!MR WISE GUY - Similar to the Alpha/Gotham edition but with more artifacting from compression. Watchable.THAT GANG OF MINE - Unwatchable! So Compressed that it is annoying to try to watch. However, it includes a scene missing from the Alpha/Gotham edition.GHOSTS ON THE LOOSE - Missing the opening titles! More compressed than other DVD releases of this title. I strongly suggest the VCI East Side Kids Double Feature version of this title.BOWERY BLITZKRIEG - Good master, but compression shows. I suggest getting Platinum's individual release of this movie, it looks good."
1,Given as a gift to a father in law,"He said it was kind of corny. He wasn't sure if it always had been corny back in the day when he used to watch East Side Kids, or if this collection was just not his favorites."
1,ugh,"i don't know how everyone rated this story so high. our heroine was in a horrible marriage, got dumped. then she gets into a relationship with our sarcastic, verbally and emotional abusive ""hero"". no matter how he acts with her, she loves him. he who only loves himself. she's pathetic, he's a lover of thousands, thinks it's ok. i wanted to tell her to pick up her pride and go home. our hero chose to be angry with her when everything wasn't going his way. UGH"
4,Paradise Found,I chose this rating because I enjoy how real the characters appear. This author does a good job of that.
2,Works. But has internal short circuit that weakens spark for the wire it's attached to,"Works just as it should. But has internal short circuit that weakens spark for the wire it's attached to, the result is that the engine doesn't run smoothly or at the correct speed when the light is attached. This might not be a problem with larger motors, however it makes it basically worthless on my 3-cyl Geo metro. My advice is just spend the extra 10 dollars and get one with an inductive pick-up as attaching the sensor lead to the spark plug wire is kinda a PITA too."
1,D.O.A.,Everything was great with Amazon except the timing light didn't work when it showed up. I returned it to Amazon and they quickly refunded my money. I would also caution people about buying this product because it doesn't have the normal inductive pickup that most timing lights have (I think that's why it's missing in the picture).
3,Direct connect timing light,Prompt service. Item shipped was as described in ad. I hope to get many years of use out of it. I'm happy!
5,awesome!,"The book is what one would expect but this edition has tons of reviews/ interviews/ analysis at the endAlso, near perfect condition as it came from library overstock :)"
2,Signifying Nothing,"By now, it will come as no surprise to anyone who follows my reviews that I am not a fan of Faulkner. But I've kept plugging along with him, because I wanted to read The Sound and the Fury, long considered one of his masterpieces. Now that I'm finished with it, I'm inclined to think the Shakespeare passage from which it gets its title sums it up nicely: ""sound and fury, signifying nothing.""I thoroughly enjoyed the autistic Benjy's segment once I got the narrators figured out. But its promise just never paid off. Here we have another disjointed unredemptive tale that's more work to figure out than its sum total is worth. I respect that some people hail Faulkner as a master, but he's decidedly not my cuppa."
2,"""Tungsteel"" is just a finish over brass.",These darts are very light and we don't like the grip. The Viper Elite Brass at 21 grams is a much better dart for the money.
1,Aaaaaaggghhh,"First of all, although the packaging doesn't make it clear, this album was recorded in concert, in less-than-ideal circumstances. Second, the compositions are rather shapeless, and tend to meander on..and on. Third, the music is unrelievedly ugly. I bought this (at import price) because I was excited at the prospect of hearing two of my favorite musicians (Reijseger's solo disc, COLLA PARTE, is wonderful, and Sclavis' ECM discs are among the best that label has to offer) in duet; don't make the same mistake. ... Now, if only someone would get these two back together, in a studio, with some rehearsal time and a few decent compositions..."
1,Moonhopper,"I purchased three of these moonhoppers for a party I had this past weekend. Withing the first half hour two of them had already broken. I wasn't expecting much out of these, however thrity minutes of use was all I got. Definately not worth the money."
3,Could have been better...,I would have liked it better if it were mulicolor instead of being all red. I know my daughter would have liked it too.
4,fun,"This is a lot of fun for the kids, but you don't get to pick the color of your moonhopper and I was given a blue ball and a blue ring. I wish we were given 2 different colors."
1,Cute.. but good?,"You have to admit it's cute. The acting is just terrible but it's fun to see local places in a movie. However, it does go to show it takes a little more than a cute blonde to make a movie watchable. Am I the only person not in the cast to write a review? Am I the only person not in the cast who saw the movie haha?"
5,Lake Forest indie film,"Lake Forest was an edge of your seat excitement...A movie that actually takes some thinking to figure out what was real or delusional. Reading the review from the liberal democrat was hilarious, because obviously the man is trying to destroy the young filmmakers dreams (lighten up Francis)...For an independent film, this could be one of the best psychological thrillers of the year! A must see film!!"
5,Carole Landis Fans Must See This,"I was so happy when I found out Brass Monkey was being released on DVD. Most people have probably never heard of this small British film but it's worth watching. The main reason to see it is because it stars the very talented and very beautiful Carole Landis. This is one of the last movies she made before her tragic death in 1948. Carole plays a singer who gets involved with the theft of a valuable brass monkey. She gives a wonderful performance which shows she could have a had a long career. Brass Monkey is a mystery but there is also a lot of singing and laughs. Caroll Levis and Terry Thomas play themselves in the film. The highlight is getting to see Carole sing the haunting ""I Know Myself Too Well"". If you are a fan of Carole Landis this is a movie you must see. If you are not a fan of Carole you need to watch this movie and see why she was such an amazing star!"
3,MORE CAROLE PLEASE!,"The movie is a bit boring, not much of a plat and story. It's too sad that this may have been Carole's last film. She adds a lot to the movie the few times she's in a scene, she was the best!Being on a DVD-R didn't help much either."
5,eeeeeeeeeeexcellent,"This is a hard record to describe just as Lambchop is a hard band to define. Its like creaky spooky masterpiece. Im not usually listening to lyrics but ""Im a Stranger Here on this is an awesome song with the mst wonderfully odd lyrics. The other song standout is the last track, which is just odd and funny and not much of an actual song..."
3,Great recorder BUT no external mic jack!,"I was very impressed with this product until I needed an external mic jack. It does not have one. Considering the price paid, it should. I ended up having to spend an additional $50 to get another machine that has one! I'll be selling my Sony, which is a shame as the clarity and functioning of this machine are superb!"
4,Useful,"These players are hard to find these days. Everything has gone digital. I was pleased to find one. Needed to play some old tapes to convert them to a digital format. This player worked just fine for the task. It worked and the playback quality was pretty good, considering the age of the media. This unit was very well priced for basically a one-off project."
4,Fun,"I got this for my 5 & 6 year old, and they really like them. Besides loads of stomping fun, my kinds have found all kinds of other ways to integrate them into their play. This week I was delivered my Valentine's letters inside a Stomper!"
5,"Simply, a great toy that doesn't require batteries.",My kids love these things. Their friends love them too when they come over. A simple toy. No batteries!!! No computers!!! No TV!!! Kids using muscles and imagination!!
4,good value and fun,"These were purchased at the same time as a more expensive version (almost 5 times the price!) and my daughter has just as much fun with them. For the money, this would be my pick. Not sure how long they will last in comparison but for as much use as they get, probably just fine."
3,A tad too late,"Had to leave for Christmas Eve at my parents. Stompers still hadn't arrived by 5:00 pm,so one less gift for my kids Christmas morning. The product was just fine, just not there in time."
2,A liability--lawsuit pending,One of the strings broke and my kid launched himself off of a retaining wall onto the concrete driveway 10 feet below.
4,Great workout,"I was looking for a new workout that I can get done in 30-40 minutes and had heard good things about Karen Voight. The exercise routine is fun and challenging and has some different moves that I've never seen before. Its a good workout, keeps my interest and I will be buying other workouts from karen voight in the future."
2,ok workout,"Let me just say that I'm a huge Karen Voight fan! I've been working out with her since Great Weighted Workout all the way to Burn and Firm. I got this dvd just to mix things up a bit. I was not impressed. I loved Strong and Smooth moves! Now thats a workout! This DVD felt like it was more for beginers! The moves are a little complicated though. I consider myself pretty good at picking up intricate steps, but I had a hard time learning these moves! I love Karens style of teaching! So if youre considering buying one of her dvds please buy Burn and Firm or Strong and Smooth moves!"
4,Nice Album,"I've always liked the Little River Band but have never bought a live album. This turned out to be a good one and I do like it. As usual, delivery was fast. Thanks."
4,pleased,i was very pleased with the product that was sent to me. i have purchased a mat before and was also very pleased
5,Scat Mat,"Great product! This keeps our cat where we don't want her from going. The 9 volt battery lasts a long time and it has 3 setting so we don't have to electrocute her when she touches it. Great for furniture, shelves, door ways etc."
1,Don't waste your money!,"It's just worthless. The suction cups are too small and do not reach to do any suction, plus it is so small that you will not be able to really see any good reflection. Don not waste your money like I did."
2,Very disappointed,"I know this product was only $14 or there abouts, but I still expected some quality for the cost. While I was installing this mirror, I pressed directly above the four suction cups in the four corners. In one corner, just pressing on the silver section caused a permanent finger print sized scar in the mirror. Since the mirror is so small, a pretty significant section of the mirror was now unusable. Cleaning it with the enclosed cleaner, or even with the seperate anti-fog spray cleaner made it streaky. I was thinking about giving this as part of a gift, but was too embarrassed because of the poor packaging and quality. If only I'd waited, I could have probably found this at the dollar store."
1,Poorly made,It looked nice when I got it but the heat of the shower is causing the mirror coating on the back to slowly come off. I'll have to replace it in a few months. The last one I bought lasted 11 years. This is a poor purchase and not worthwhile.
5,Works great for me,"I have used these mirrors for many years, and have one in each shower for shaving. They are small and unobtrusive, yet functional. They can fog up during a shower, but a splash of water clears it right up. The suction cups are a little small, and the mirror has fallen off on occasion. Only once did it break, not the mirror itself (which isn't even rigid), but the plastic frame."
4,good value,"Tried this mirror on shower wall and it sticks really well, also works really well. I would recommend this mirror to anyone. Service and shipping was easy."
1,Over rated,Does not stay on shower wall or stay fog free. Hoped this mirror would be usefull while shaving in shower.Tried many times to clean the wall and face of mirror--
5,CORPSE ARE BACK WITH A BANG!!!!!!!!,"It's been 1 week since Kill has been released, and it has yet to leave my Stereo..Kill is the best Corpse release period..Submerged in Boiling Flesh, greatest CC song ever, To Struggle Is Useless, damn that's awesome"
5,HAIL CORPSE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!KILL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Just recentaly got this cd.The cd store where I shopat was sold out of it,I couldn't believe it after 2-3 days sold out..This world must be coming to a end.In all, this Cd was worth the wait, the solo's, Riffs, Machine Gum drum effect, THE BASS, Fisher's vocal's on this one VERY AWESOME. This album was everything you expected and more. Corpse have released their best album to date."
4,"Not as Good as Tomb of the Mutilated or The Wretched Spawn, But Still Good","I consider myself a pretty big fan of Corpse, old and new school, and while this album is not they're best, it certainly is far from they're worst. My personal favorite is Tomb of the Mutilated, but that's just me. But this album has it's upsides. The track Five Nails Through the Neck is awesome and in my opinion one of they're better tracks, but a lot of the songs are just re-hashed concepts that are beginning to grow tiresome. Still Cannibal Corpse remains a dominating figure in death metal even after 17 years."
3,fairly mediocre...,"I like this band and the death metal genre, but to me, kill just doesn't do the trick. I'm pretty sure that cc rushed to get their tenth album out for accomplishment of quantity (ten albums from a death metal band is DEFINITELY an accomplishment)over quality. this album seems really flat and undistinguishable, most likely because corpse's most creative member, ex-guitarist Jack Owens, quit the band after the wretched spawn. I would recommend gore obsessed, or any albums from the chris barnes era."
3,Full Blast!!!,"These days it seems as if the melodic death metal scene was taking over the underground realms of metal, with extremely talented bands like In Flammes, Children Of Bodom and Arch Enemy leading the charge. Now Cannibal Corpse releases an album that shows us the darker side of death metal. ""Kill"" is certainly in the top 10 of 2006,the cannibals show their impressive arsenal of riffs, crunching bass lines, maniacal drum fills and twisted vocals. The reason why this album is among Cannibal Corpse's best is simple fact that almost every song is a stand out, songs like ""Necrosadistic Warning,"" ""Make Them Suffer,"" ""Purification By Fire,"" and ""The Time To Kill Is Now,"" are not only solid neck-brakers, but are musically some of the best songs that the band has recorded in years. A huge part of the succes of this album is the mix, which could not be better for a death metal album. ""Kill"" is a reminder that Cannibal Corpse is among the best extreme metal bands of all time."
2,ENOUGH ALREADY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Cannibal Corpse really need to hang it up........all their albums souond EXACTLY the same, and they've been at this for about 20 years or so.........and their time in the spotlight has come and gone......tI honestly haven't listened to them since Chris Barnes left in the mid 90's......so, please guys.you can only carry this schtick for so long...please give it up and leave while you at least hove SOME integrity left"
1,There worst CD yet,This is a sorry excuse for death metal ( I might as well be listing to Limp Bizkit) I can see why i stopped listen to this band years ago. When did Cannibal Corpse become a Nu Metal band :(
3,It's eh...,"I honestly dont know what do make of this CD. It's mediocre I guess. The lyrics suck, as do all CC lyrics...but the music isn't that bad. It starts to sound a lot alike after a while though and some songs seem just carelessly thrown together. Theres a few good songs though. Still, I wouldnt recommend buying it unless you're a die-hard fan."
2,Its...ok,"I heard most of this cd,i mean yeah its not bad but i wouldnt waste money on it.Besides anymore cannibal corpse is becoming the limp bizkit of death metal and it gets annoying when thats the only death metal band most people listen to(that and six feet under).For better death metal check out anybody from razorback records, and for non razorback records death metal bands check out exhumed and origin."
1,These guys are still around?,"Boy, I was surprised to hear these guys were still around...and that they have released their tenth album. Is is any good? Well, if you are a Cannibal Corpse fan (and apparently, there are plenty of them out there), they could put excrement on a platter and you'd buy it. This release shows no progression from their first one. It is still silly, gorey b-movie crud that attempts to pass itself off as music. Still, there are those out there that continually buy these CDs, which is really scary. If, after 17 years and 10 albums you are still listening to Cannibal Corpse, there is something odd about you. Hey, that's cool...some people thrive in oddness. I'm sure you are otherwise a perfectly stable human being. But, seriously, it's time to venture out of the dungeon and expose yourself to something that will not leave your ears bleeding. Heck, jump on the Arctic Monkey bandwagon if you have to... just leave the swamp for a while, please."
5,Way To Go Cannibal,"After hearing all the hype for this album, I was anxious to hear Kill and I Am Not Dissapointed.."
3,Hello,Where are the rest of the videos...simply incomplete! I would not have purchase if I had knew this did not have ALL the videos on the DVD.
2,Not That Great,"The convection cooking is a joke. The Temperature control is way off. Slow cooking produces burned roast.In fairness I bought this from the factory outlet and it was a returned unit sold as used-like new. It does cook but you have to figure out the niceties of where to set the temp and adjust the time accordingly. I wouldn't recommend it over the eighteen qt non-convection oven which works much better, but as noted somewhere else in the reviews it will cook two stuffed chickens at once if you watch them and that's mainly why I wanted it. I have learned to live with it after some trial and error and use it only in the roasting mode - no convection."
2,So-So Quality,Somewhat poorly put together when compared to older Nesco ovens. Outer shell of the oven tends to 'cave in' a bit too easy...and handles don't seem to be sturdy enough to support the weight of the oven ... and even more so with a full load of food. Recommend caution when using... and especially keep young children away since outer parts become very hot. I believe Nesco should put an extra $5 of structural integrity in the oven (and charge for it) if they want to maintain a quality built image. If you can find a older/used Nesco model (not made in China) I think you would be better off. Overall: quality and safety concerns.
2,"good one, but......","Doesn't tell you how to get to the starting point. Maybe should also give directions from major highways. 2) In the mtn bike section, could not figure out where I can start on a path. I chose mtn bike riding because I don't like being on the roads. It was hard to tell the difference on the key between dirt road and paved path. The key icons look very similiar."
4,Happy riding,"Great book! Very helpful when it came to clear, concise descriptions of what I would encounter on my ride. Have lent this book to about 5 friends and they've all said it was helpful. My book is pretty beat up now but still going strong!"
2,"Foul smelling, I don't dare use it.","I've had birds for almost 25 years and given them a lot of cuttlebones. This is the first package I've ever opened where the cuttlebones both had a putrid fishy odor. One had discolorations on it as well. I'm not going to use it as there is clearly something remaining besides the mineral. I'm not blaming the seller, but it's the last time I buy them online. These were from Thailand."
2,Came in Broken,Product arrived broken. In the future I'll just buy these locally. I wish the packaging was better. I'd return it but I'm not going to jump through hoops to save a couple bucks.
3,smelled weird,was just what i ordered...but it smelled weird. My turtles are not using these ones up as fast as they do the other ones i had. Huh
3,"Works great, but unfortunately clumsy","The sleek industrial design of the power unit belies the heavy-duty industrial ""design"" of the wires that connect to it: they are thick, heavy, and inflexible.While other laptop adapters can manage with a thin AC cable and two-prong plug, the iGo uses a heavy cable with giant plugs at each end that would be better suited for powering a refrigerator than a laptop. The same is true of the power output cable: an unecessary heavy braided shield visible through the thick and low-flexibility PVC insualtion makes that cable hard to use. I've often had the adapter tip pop out of its socket on the laptop because the cable doesn't bend properly.The power part works great, but I wish they'd offer replacement cables."
1,IGo is a NO Go!,"I purchased the IGo 7500 dualpower unit for a Dell laptop, but soon afterward bought a Compaq latop that IGo did not then have a tip for. I have written IGo 8 times asking if they intended to supply a tip for my new laptop. I have never, in six months, received a reply. I would strongly recommend you do not consider buying any product made by this company."
1,Does not work with DELL!!! Poor tech support.,"I bought the iGo Juice 70. Seems like a good idea with auto adaptor. However, the DELL adaptor does not charge the computer (it's ""power only""). I can't think of reason why anyone would spend $100 on a mobile charger that doesn't charge the device. They don't make this clear through their website or their third party vendors. On top of it all their customer service wouldn't take the return and told me I should have known."
3,Worked great while it worked,"Mine worked great for a couple of years as a 2nd power supply for my Mac G4 Powerbook, but I mostly only used it around the house.When I actually started traveling with it, I got the tip for charging my Motorola phone and Bluetooth headset and it worked great from the 12V car outlet too until the output (device-side) multi-pin cable started to come apart and I had a couple of incidents where the pins shorted with visible sparking. The unit will shut down with its own overvoltage protection when this occurs.After the last such incident however the unit now exhibits the ""flashing blue light of death"" syndrome, even when no device or even any output cable is attached, so I assume it's toasted. I'm torn about buying a new one, since I have a number of relatively expensive device tips and cables which I hate to write off, and the unit is now down to twenty-five bucks compared to nearly one hundred when I bought it..."
2,Died after a year,"Was great to be able to power up my Sidekick smartphone and laptop from one plug in the wall. But after a year, I had to ""jiggle"" it to get the blue light to stay on and then it died completely.Too expensive to only last a year.I'm back to carrying two OEM chargers with me when I travel. <sigh>"
1,Worked fine until the warranty ended,"This thing was a godsend... for a while. I didn't need to tote around 2 power supplies for my HP and Apple laptops.I awoke today to the ""rapid pulsing"" quoted by another user. The light actually gets weaker when the cable that goes to the laptop is connected.Avoid this thing."
3,Good idea needs work,"I travel with a notebook and a cell phone. This unit allows me to use/charge both in car, plane, at home, and at the hotel.I thought I'd save some bulk and combine two chargers in one. The IGO charger, cables, and associated tips are far bulkier than the two chargers I was trying to replace. The design team needs to work harder on making this a truly great product."
2,iGo adapter useful but cables are poor quality,"When I travel, I have spend more time packing up my electronic gear then my cloths so the thought of having to carry a few less cables was quite appealing. The problem, however, is that the cords that come with the iGo are completely unreliable. I have gone through 3 sets of replacement cords in a few years and now I am in need of a fourth set. The replacements aren't that expensive but when you are out on the road and your power cord stops working it means your computer stops working and furthermore, trying to get a replacement cord can be difficult, even online.I highly recommend skipping the use of iGo products unless they improve the quality of the cords. I'm sure it is very big business for them selling replacements but when spending $100 or more for power adapters you would hope they would last at least as long as the original would with the same usage."
2,doesn't work on airplanes,I bought this product to charge my PowerBook G4 in airplanes. I'm on the plane at the moment- writing this review- b/c there is no plug suitable for the airplane-plug of I-go in the economy class- and I don't know the business and first classes. I'll return this product as soon as I get back to the U.S.
2,Great Idea - Lousy Execution,"I bought my Igo about three years ago because the concept made so much sense ... sadly the unit did not live up to expectations. As many people have noted in their reviews, a moron designed the cables and the ""brick"" weighs as much as a real brick. I only take it with me when traveling overseas just to have a backup power supply and for occasional use on the plane. (I still take my OEM chargers with me and keep the Igo in the suitcase.) Now it is deciding to quit charging every once in a while and I have to fiddle with the plug to wake it back up. You might believe, as I once did, that something so solid would last forever but my Igo has proven otherwise. I could easily imagine some laptop companies bundling the Igo with their equipment had they designed a great product, but unfortunately they failed miserably on that score."
5,Everywhere has worked everywhere,"I bought this unit from RS in May 05 as we were moving overseas for two years and wanted something compatible everywhere. It has been perfect. I travel with this one charger kit and use it for PSP, three types of phones, two types of Ipods, three different laptops and it has worked everwhere we have travelled from Cyprus to Egypt to Africa to Thialand and more. I just recently had to order a new cable as it broke from my own carelessness."
1,short life,"heavy , bulky , and the brick quit working just out of warranty.Igo said I had to buy new kit can't buy just the brick."
3,"okay, but Capt of Crush are MUCH better","these grippers are most definitely an improvement over the wal-mart/Dicks cheapos (the ones your 78 year old aunt can do 100 reps on). However, as time goes by, the springs eventually fatigue and the span grows shorter and shorter. Also, IMHO the weight ratings are way over rated. I can do a couple dozen reps with each hand on the 250# heavy gripper, but only about 5 on the Captain of Crush #2, which I believe is rated at only 195#.If you are thinking of purchasing this entire set - save your $$$ and buy the #1, #2 and #2.5 COC grippers."
2,One of them is defective,"Product does what it claims. However, I'm giving it a two star instead of five because my 250 lbs gripper is misaligned (i.e, one of the holding thing is much shorter than the other) which makes it basically dysfunctional. It makes me wonder if they even do quality assurance on their products. :("
1,Why get these when you can get the real CoC grips?,I don't know maybe it was just the batch I got but the 200 was just as easy as a plastic store bought gripper to me and the 250 wasn't much better but then the 300 which is supposed to be just 50 lbs more feels like its really a lot more than that. The 350 feels exactly like the 300. I can close the 300 but It should be easier to do if I can do the 250 for reps of 15. Just seems like the resistance levels are entirely inaccurate. I am ordering the Captains of Crush hand grips since you can get certified if you can close the number three. So if thats the case those grips have to be very accurate. Anyway over all I feel I waisted my money on these grips.
1,DO NOT PURCHASE FROM HERE,I received my item but I had a change of mind a few days later and decided to return it. This seller DOES NOT respond to any type of inquiry regarding returns at all. EXTREMELY UNPROFESSIONAL...AVOID AVOID AVOID!!!
4,Heavy Grip,"So i purchased this item 2 moths ago and got say i loved them.I had a weak crushing grip, so when i got the gripers i stated with the lowest heavy grip griper with is the 100 pound one,i had a lot of trouble closing it,after 1 week i was able to close it.Now i can do 9-11 reps on the 100lb griper and close the 150lb twice.The only problem i encounter is the 100lb griper squeaks when you use it."
4,As expected,"I would agree with the others that the knurling is a bit coarse, but you can mitigate that in a number of ways, particularly tape.Either Chemlight's a beast, I'm a punk, or his order was defective.I can't close 250, so they seem accurate to me.Like another poster, I had noticed some tendinitis in the elbow region, but this disappeared after I began varying hand position (sets pronated, neutral, supinated, etc.), instead of doing all sets in the same position."
4,A genuine workout,"These are real grippers. I could do the 100lb (lightest) for about 40 reps each hand, but can't do more than 12 with the next one up: 150lb. Good quality product."
5,Value Buy,"These instruments have really developed my pinch and grip strength; by the time I finished with the intermediate, I could already see muscular bulges in my hand, when clenched into a fist. I think the package purchase is the only way to go and a definite worthwhile investment."
5,Great Product,"Great set of grippers. Very solid, even after near daily use over the past few years they spring back like new. Diamond cut pattern makes it easy to keep your grip with two fingers or four. I would buy another set but I don't think that will ever be necessary."
5,"Great grippers, no complaints","Opened the box right when i got it, and busted out the 100lb grippers. To my suprise they were far more difficult then I expected. But with practice i hope to one day close the 350lb grippers. This is an awesome set because allows you to work your way up, and become stronger! Defintaly glad I bought these, and worth every penny. And to the people complaining about the knurled(rough) handle: It's like that for a reason. If the handle didn't have this rough industrial feel, you'd never be able to grip it as easy!! Sure your hands will be sore and calloused for the first few weeks or so. But your hands will adapt, and get stronger; all part of the process. If you want to increase gripping power, and finger strength buy these. Overall good for increasing grip in any sport... especially gymnastics! So far... so good!"
5,nice,This was a great buy I use them my grip is already getting better I like how you are able to work up to the next one in 50 lb. incriments.
1,Marketing Scam,"The pizza kit does not contain enough for 4 meals. It contains 2 dough packs, a cheese pack, and a spice pack. That is the 4 packs.All of the Real Meal packs use this scam. The ""4 pack"" cake kit includes 1 icing, and 3 cakes mixes to make the 3 layer cake on the package. Not 4 cakes, 4 packs of ingredients.The pretzel kit includes the ""salt"" pack as one pack so it doesn't make 4 pretzels, it makes 2.Same thing for the 4 pack on the HORRIBLE macaroni & cheese. 2 packs of macaroni and, you guessed it, 2 packs of cheese powder.Although my son has fun using the oven, I refuse to give anything higher than 1 star for this because of how low the marketing group at Hasbro is willing to go."
1,30 pages does NOT make a book,"This book feels like nothing more than 32 pages of a high-school student brainstorming what counts in his or her life.I was ready for a slim book, when the Amazon listing said it was only 62 pages. The listing is incorrect. You only get 32 pages (plus a few ads). And some of those 32 pages are blank, lined pages for you to scribble notes.So, what are the secrets that the author reveals in this stapled ""leaflet""?Well...Did you know that choices count? How about money? It counts too.(Would you call this high-powered business information?)The subtitle of the book is ""A High Velocity Formula for Maximum Achievement.""Where's the ""formula""?Learning that 'health counts' is hardly a formula and certainly not going to instantly move me closer to my goals.This ""pamphlet"" really deserves less than one star.-=-=-=-=-=-=---Keith Pascal, author of martial arts books that give you an edge"
2,Tastes like pumpkin pie...,"This takes nothing like chocolate at all. It has a strong cinnamin/nutmeg flavor that reminds me of pumpkin pie. I tried one and don't think I'll be drinking any more. As far as energy goes, I do think it works - but I can't enjoy the drink enough to continue."
3,Not Chocolatey but a wonderful Tea.,I was trying to quit coffee and a friend suggested this tea to help wean me off the need for caffeine. The chocolate flavor is very subtle but the taste is great and as of today I am caffeine free.
5,Great Tea but Too Expensive!,"I love this tea, the flavor is great! I buy this brand at Trader Joe's and pay $4.69 a box. I didn't really read the description of this tea, I was in a hurry. I presumed it was a 3 box purchase for $14.61, not one box! Trader's doesn't carry this chocolate flavor, so I will enjoy this purchase, but can't afford to make another one!!!"
2,"Too much like chai, and the stevia is too strong","If you like chai, than you'll probably like this... I don't. I do however like unsweetened Yerba Mate, and wouldn't mind if it came with a more complex flavors. In the past I've mixed it with herbal mint or berry teas with good results and I was hoping this would be one bag solution to a chocolaty version. I knew it had other ingredients other than Mate and Cocoa, but were hoping they were milder background notes than they turned out to be. After I bought this I found (The Republic of Tea, Double Dark Chocolate Mate, 36-Count) and it's exactly what I was looking for, earthy and aromatic but not sweet cocoa flavors. It's a little pricey, but I feel it's worth it. I'm still happy with Guayaki's plain mate, but I'm going to have to pass on this one.PROS:+ Nice quality Chai style MateCONS:- Tastes like Chai and Stevia (neither of which I particularly care for)"
4,Same yerba mate with just a hint of chocolate,"I am already a fan ofOrganic Yerba Mate Tea 25 Bagsand a fan of chocolate. This mix is the best of yerba mate with just a hint of chocolate. If you are looking for a more milk-chocolate flavor, try it with a little sweetener and milk. The hint of chocolate gives this yerba mate a more bitter flavor closer to coffee than the plain yerba matte but without the coffee acid and reduced caffeine. Yerba mate is a good flavor in itself and not just as a coffee substitute. The chocolate gives us yerba mate fans some variety in flavors."
3,Hardly Chocolate,"I hardly caught the chocolate hint in this tea. It is more of a spicy tea with a teeny tiny hint of chocolate. It's good if that's what you're looking for, but I was hoping for more chocolate. I tried it with an almond/coconut milk and without anything added and preferred the tea with the milk."
4,Blues and Rock with Phil at his best,A very rare find. I have the album but the CD would be worth the effort. Very soul full and bluesy. A guitar player or fan would appreciate. Snowy White appears and Phil sings to the audience
4,a capable and ambitious explainer,"Davies has managed a masterly survey of modern physical theory. He covers a lot of area, so the treatment of some topics is brief. Always the teacher, he props up concepts with good models and examples. Davies has, in this and other books, registered as one of the best explainers of quantum concepts. Superforce includes an engaging description of the importance of mathematics as the language of physics. It also explains why some slightly opaque terms such as `fields' and energy' are useful in explaining physics mathematically."
2,poor wear qualities,"I bought two of these stones, a fine and super fine. They remove a lot of metal from the blade, so you have to be careful to only use them for an initial honing. The biggest dislike is how rapidly the stones wear. They are supposed to be diamond but seem to wear very fast. Although they remove metal rapidly at first they wear down quickly and become super super fine after a couple on knife are sharpened."
3,not new,"I sent the first one of these videos back because it had been opened and was scratched. The second one came and was not scratched but was also not sealed. Not sure, but it appeared they were not new. The video had good information however and I think the video is worth the price. I was dissappointed with the fact that it was probably a used video being sold as a new one."
5,"By far, one of the greatest albums I own.","When i first saw Verbena's cd, it was at a record store near my house. They didnt have any Pixies or Pavement so i was looking aound when i saw the odd cover of Verbena's ""Souls for Sale."" It caught my eye, and just as a test i picked it up and bought it. The first track ""Hot Blood"" slapped my right in the face. It was exactly the sound i had wanted. The female and male vocals were both amazing. The musicians' product seemed to loll along coherently, while at the same time their music was so jaded. It's not a child of Nirvana, nor a child of Weezer; Verbena is something on it's own. There's really no way to describe it in words, or any other medium i know about for that matter."
5,One of the best CDs I own,"This is one of those really great hidden gem albums. Considering the state of music it's not surprising that an album of this brilliance went unnoticed by many. My personal favorite songs on this album would have to be 'the dessert', 'hey come on', 'postcard blues', and the wonderful 'the song that ended your career.' Of course, all the songs are simply great. While Verbena has been deemed a Nirvana rip off for many reasons like the lead singer kinda looks like Curt Kobain, and kinda sounds like Kobain, and I've been told has some of the same mannerisms as Kobain, they are simply not. They have a unique style all their own that is by far better than that of most bands around today. Their second album, Into the Pink, is a bit darker in its tone and not quite as good in my opinion but still great. This is definately I would recommend checking out."
5,kid from birmingham,"this is so cool, i know anne marie so well. i love their music, and they're so fun to see live, i have seen them 3 times, and have seen anne marie a few times at the mall and around, they're great, i really advise you to get this cd, it's awesome."
2,Aggravated by Leftover Ingredients,"I must be very honest. I thought that I would like to try so many of the recipes contained in this cookbook after looking at the wonderfully appealing pictures of recipes over and over. First, I tried the Maryland Fried Chicken. After mixing the ingredients and following the directions throughout the recipe, it turned out that there was a pretty large amount of ingredients left. Although this may have been on my part, as a new home cook, much of the coating for my chicken slid off and ended up on the bottom of the frying pan. However, the chicken tasted wonderful, and my family and I loved it. I was just displeased that part of the ingredients ended up going to waste. After making the chicken, I decided to try the Hidded Cherry Cookies. Again, there were left over ingredients- this time it was melted chocolate. Frustrated, I did not try any more recipes from this cookbook."
2,Good overview but bias in most of its analysis,Gives you a one point view from the African Sudanese and their perspective of the situation and the issues facing them in the Sudan. Somehow bias in their presentation of their cause. Needs to be more balanced. I would recommend it if interested in the Sudanese Liberation Army point of view of the events taking place in The Sudan.
1,Dense and confusing,I bought this because I love Sculpting in Time but there are far better books. The authors analysis is out dated and is difficult to follow. They also describe a lot of material that doesn't help understand the films. I gave up reading it and I'm a film student so I don't recommend. There are definitely beter books.
2,"Decent Source of Background Info, but Flawed Critique","I also think that this book is too full of academic theory and techniques, and this may be the reason it comes off as so cynical. It works best in providing factual background that would be difficult to find otherwise. But when the book shades into critique, the tone becomes dry and pre-occupied, if not positively dispiriting - particularly when the co-authors subject Tarkovsky to their brand of Freudian analysis. The result is a disjointed collection of facts and vexing speculations, which on balance does a disservice to the poetry of the films. I personally much prefer Maya Turovskaya's book, which doesn't have the encyclopedic range of facts one finds in ""Fugue"" (a friend of mine described ""Fugue's"" method as ""trainspotting"") but is a far more inspired and illuminating combination of intelligent insight and love of its subject."
2,Academically Smug and Distasteful,"This book purports to be the definitive work on Tarkovsky's films, yet at closer inspection this is perhaps one of the worst books on him. Why? The authors are conceited, smug academics who never miss an opportunity to take a swipe at Tarkovsky personally, who is obviously in no position to answer back. Furthermore, their interpretations of his films are somewhat narrow and overly literary (one of the hazards I suppose of spending your life on campus and not in the real world). Finally, the authors also never miss a chance to criticize other writers on Tarkovsky over what they perceive to be mistakes which are, more often than not, merely cases of Johnson and Petrie being overly critical when their own work is far from perfect, or simply wrong. Having got all that off my chest, this book does some good stuff in it, but it has to be weeded out. It's just a pity about the authors and their attitude. Caveat emptor."
4,One of those books that makes you smile,"The Fall and Rise of Reginald Perrin is the funniest book I have read in a long time. After getting used to the British slang and unusual mood of the book, I was hooked.It takes a while to realize what is going on, and when you do - that is when the situations are funny.The humor is slight and you have to pay attention to get the jokes; especially theinsults he gives to his family and co-workers. The ending is hard to accept, untillyou realize it is the perfect mix-up to this mans mid-life crisis."
1,Save your money and buy a Mead notebook,"This is a huge disapointment. Yes, it has pictures of the animals from the Animal Cards, along with parsimonious prose, that is, I guess, suppose to be instructive. But most of the pages are blank, except for the lines upon which one is to write. I counted well over two hundred blank pages. Ok, it does say Journal in the title, but this book is not bound in such a way as it can easily be written in. This is a waste of money for the consumer. Instead, I recommend buying the original Medicine Cards along with a Mead notebook and your experience will be richer as will your pocket book."
1,DID THE AUTHORS JUST NEED TO MAKE MORE MONEY??,"There is NO guidance in this so called Guided Journal! If anythng they could have at least made it a spiral bound book but they did not even do that. Just page after page of blank lined nothing with A Blk& Wht. Picture of the Animal with little saying that are supose to bring great wisdom.. What a shame! These cards are GREAT and have been a source if inspiration to me for years. They added animals to a new deck which I do not have... And it costs a bunch..why did they not offer the extra cards in a seperate packet instead of just re-doing it? Money? If you REALLY want to Write about what you get extra from the cards then buy a notebook, Spirial Please. I am so disapointed in this 200 some page ""book"" I would not want anyone one else to have to find out the hard way as I did...Too bad David Carson, Shame falls on you."
