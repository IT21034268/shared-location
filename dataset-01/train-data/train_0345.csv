4,A digestible effort with little novelty,"This album has a concise set of 11 R&B; tracks, ranging from the up-tempo dance numbers, ""Lose My Breath"" and ""Soldier"" to slower, balladry grooves like ""If"" and ""Love"". Nevertheless, the album lacks anything notably spectacular or unheard... the girls continue to showcase their expert ability to harmonize and put forth virtually impeccable vocals, each one having a different style of singing (Beyonce has incredible range and uses it to the fullest; Kelly, a sweet, melodic tone; Michelle, airy and sexy). It is altogether a digestible CD, however, a successor to this album will definitely need to be ""stepped up"".The obvious influences are here... the Pointer Sisters in the gospel fused funk of ""Through With Love""; the 90s laid back soul of En Vogue shines in the breathtaking ""Free""...but the girls come through with stylish effort. Other high points include the classic grooving ""Girl"" and the sultry tracks ""T-Shirt"" and ""Cater 2 U""."
3,"Some Good, Some Weak","Destiny's Child newest album Destiny's Fulfilled is filled with slow songs and several uptempo songs. The first song Lose My Breath is a great uptempo song with great backing music. Solider was their first major hit, other standout songs include the third single Girl. Another impressive solo song by Kelly is Bad Habit. Two songs with old school feel and impressive vocals is If and Through With Love. Weaker songs include Cater 2 U, and T-Shirt. The weakest song is Love a slow ballad that loses your attention in record time. Free and Is She The Reason are average songs that are forgetable.Stand Out SongsLose My Breath, Solider, Girl, Thourgh With Love, IfWeak SongsCater 2 U, T-Shirt, Love"
2,Not their Best,"This album has only five songs I like on it ( Free, Lose my breath , Game over(bonus Track) , & Soilder). the beats a terrible. if you do buy this album, buy the album with the bonus tracks, something extra is just what this album needs. I purchased my copy from Wal-Mart and it came with a bonus disc then i felt better about the purchase of this album."
2,I want my money back...,"I really liked the two singles that came out so I thought I should just buy the album. Bad idea. I should have gone to Amazon and listened to the whole album first.The songs are generic R&B; songs and the lyrics in some of them are enough to make me want to throw up. Just listen to ""T-Shirt."" All I could do while listening to this CD was roll my eyes and ask ""Why?""They are amazing women with stellar voices and while I like their slow songs, I wish they would have had more upbeat ones.I hope in a few years they come out with another album that has the sounds I think most of their listeners are looking for."
2,What happened ?????????,"This CD was a definate OOOKKKAAAYYYYY. Only 11 tracks???? I don't think so. There are only a handful of songs that u can listen to more than once such as ""If"" or ""Cater 2 U"" or ""T-Shirt"". Michelle hardly does any vocals on the CD except for a making an appearance on a few songs and a few runs. I would have expected this CD to be better...especially since they all did their individual thing and then wanted to do the group thing again. If their individual CDs were good there is no excuse as to why this CD is so lame. Don't get me wrong I still love their voices but the songs on this CD......sorry but it is just not in the same category as their previous albums."
1,Unfulfilled,"You know I thought they were going to bring it, apparently I was wrong. The songs sound the same with an extra tweak or twang here or there to change it up. The video for loose my breath really looked ridiculous. What is with this wannabe ""street hood business woman, chic"" gang fight? It was for lack of a better word-corny. And it had nothing to do with the song. I think they knew this album was going to be a loser, and that's why they hurried up and put out the next single Soldier. This album is just plain boring."
3,Destiny's Child,"I was so excited when i bought this CD , because i love Destiny's child and their 2 hit singles ""Lose my breath"" and ""soldier""! This CD is pretty good it could have been better. The songs are mostly slow and are mostly R&B/soul type, so if your looking for a hip-hop style this isnt the cd. There are only 3 songs that are fast, which is (Lose my breath, Soldier, and Through with love-which is kinda fast but not really). My least favorite song of all was ""free"" i didnt like it at all, but alltogether the songs were good and so were the lyrics! This cd is great and buy it if r&b/soul is your type, or listen to the samples and decide yourself."
2,WHAT HAPPENED???,"I really liked the Destiny's child songs, I loved Survivor, Bootylicious, Independent women. I looooved Beyonce's debut, Crazy in love is one of the greatest songs in R&B, so when I hard that another Destiny's album was coming out I was excited. Lose my breatch was a kick - a$$ single and I expected the albbum to be like that, boy was I wrong!!! WHAT HAPPENED TO THE INDEPENDENT WOMEN, now they are talking about needing a soldier that carries big thing if you know what they mean, to wear their man's t- shirt, I wanted a lot more beats not so many ballads!!! There are a few songs who save the cd like Girl and If, but all in overall is a HUGE dissapointment, bring back the independent and fun women!!!"
1,Worst Album of 2004,"If there's one mainstream album to avoid this year, it's this one. It's quite the stinker. Lose my breath is an average destiny's child single that's neither daring nor memorable. Soldier, the followup single to Lose my breath, is ok. By far the most disappointing work by the group to date. Nice try but Beyonce has officially abandoned the group."
4,"Great, after a while...","First it sounds simple and boring, but after a while you realize that it continues to grow. And then suddenly it's a great album, the mix is perfect!"
2,Disappointed,"I bought this CD without hesitation because I believed all the hype about this being an anticipated album and I knew that DC always came up with the goods. I was much impressed by their first single because it's the sort of tune to get up and shake your booty with but alas that's where the booty shaking ends. Don't get me wrong, I like slow grooves but when I think of DC I always think of kick-ass upbeat songs which advocates the empowerment of women and letting your hair down to party with your girlfriends and that element which I expected from DC was lacking from this album. So if you like the upbeat DC songs go buy the ""lose my breath"" single and skip this one."
1,Big Disappointment !!!!!,I am a Destiny's Child fan and I was very disappointed with this CD. I rate it 1 star and that is being nice. The only good songs were the ones played on the radio and Cater 2 U. I must say that this is the reason why people burn and download music illegally on the internet. I expected so much more from these girls. A pure waste of my $12. But I guess that is the music business for you.... artists still get paid even if their music is B.S. Needless to say that I am still a DC fan and I pray that their album will be better next time around. Don't waste your money on this CD. Buyers beware!!!!!
2,Onto Beyonce,"They should have let Rodney Jerkins produce most of the tracks...After Lose My Breathe, they lost their breathe...All the other songs are so slow and although some are good, the album doesn't flow...As far as them supposedly maturing? They are all in their low to mid 20's, multimillionaires, with no kids...Lets have some fun girls enough of the sad stuff."
2,What a let down....,"I was really looking forward to this cd and thought it was going to be full of fast paced sounds like their single ""Loose my breath"" but after the first two songs which happen to be the two out right now the rest of the cd is not good. They have beats that don't go with the specific songs and there is nothing but slow songs. Plus the lyrics in the songs? I mean why sing about wearing your man's t-shirt and what you will do for him. Plus all of the songs are mostly the hook just being sung over and over again. Just like their last Cd Survivor this cd was not worth it. I expected better from them. If you want to listen to slow songs with beats that are way off and too cartoon like then buy this album. Otherwise you are better off downloading their two main singles and be done with it. The reason they deserved two stars is because they are a great group..they just didn't have it on this album."
3,When the chemistry is dying....it's hard to hide.,"I've been a DC fan since inception and I have to admit that when I heard that they were coming out again...I knew that Beyonce's songwriting skills and vocals had improved alot so I hoped the same for the other members. This is true on this cd, especially Michelle who is lot more confident but as a whole?? I think there is a lot of corniness on this one. Most of the songs like Soldier and Free are ridiculously bad and generic. I do like ""Is she the reason"" and ""Through with love"". Other than that this album does not deserve the hype that it's getting. It does not compare to Beyonce's CD at all and it seems very forced. I think Matthew Knowles pushed for a reunion album just because people didnt think they could. The harmonies are good and the arrangements are tight but the creativity is severely lacking. I hate to see it but I think this is the end of the white hot road for these ladies as a group."
5,"The Best Since ""The Writings""!","This is definitely a classic Destiny's Child album. Every song on here is good. All three of the ladies have grown vocally. Michelle--Girl you did your thang! She went off on ""Through with Love"", showing more vocal range than Beyonce in this particular song. This is definitely my favorite song on the album and it should be a single. Their harmonies are so tight on songs like ""Free"" and ""If."" This is a must-have album."
2,THIS IS A TRAIN WRECK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,THIS TRAIN HAS BEEN LEAVING THE TRACK SINCE BEYONCE RELEASED HER FIRST SOLO ALBUM!
3,Destiny Fullfilled...,"I like ""Lose My Breath"" now after listening to it after a while and ""Is She the Reason"". I love ""Soldier"" and ""Through with Love"" <<the best song on the CD. T-Shirt is pretty good. ""Cater 2 U"" is loved by many fans."
4,Go DC!!!,"Most people that write bad reviews on Destiny's Child or Beyonce are usually haters. This is a great album, not perfect, but it is worth listening. DC and Beyonce are at the top of their game. Give credit when credit is due, haters!!!"
1,"Destiny's Child ""Unfulfilled"" & Goodbye Destiny's Child!","I am a fan of Destiny's Child but I only like track #1 on this CD, that's all. The rest is just like other R&B stuffs we listen to everyday on radio or BET! Nothing sounds special like Destiny's Child. Why did they bother to release this album at first place? I am so disappointed and upset because I was waiting for this CD to come out for a long long time. Oh well, this is a good reason for Destiny's Child not to exist anymore. The end of this beautiful-talented girl group - DJ Hong <www.omahajoy.com>"
3,"Like it alot, but it could have been WAY better","I really liked this album. There are a few things that are wrong with it and the main one being that it is too slow! There is only 1 song you can really dance to, that being ""Lose My Breath"".They SHOULD NOT have released ""Girl"" as a single!!! It was such a weak song to put out as a single when they could have released something better. They should have released ""Through With Love"" which is the BEST song from the album and the BEST Destiny's Child song ever!Single's should have been:1. Lose My Breath2. Soldier3. Cater 2 U4. Through With LoveOther than the singles, the best songs are:1. Through With Love(the BEST song of their career!)2. Bad Habit(Kelly's solo track. Its awesome)3. Tshirt(I hated it @ 1st but it grew on me)4. Love(pretty ballad from all 3 girls)Worst song on here is:""IS SHE THE REASON""!! Horrible song!!!!!!"
3,I Need a bigger bang,"The best song on here is Cater-2-U and that is not saying much. This is was a over-hyped CD. Too many hip-hop beats and samples for my taste. If you are going to do something you should do it right. This sounds like a force recording like when Marvin Gaye refused to record with Diana Ross in the same studio. I love Beyonce, Kelly and Michelle but this is not there best effort and i'm rather angry.Why do they get 3 stars? Well because they are Destiny Child and them doing a half ass job is still better than what else is out in the music world these days."
2,Not Enough Effort Involved,I own all their previous albums and this is by far the worse album to date seriously. I know others may disagree & that's their opinion but this is mine. Destiny Fullfilled didnt gets no love. I hear alot of people bumpin this album but that dont matter to me because I dont like it. One of the most dissapointed thing about the album was the length because I paid 14.99 & their were only 11 songs which means they all better be top notch and of course they wasnt. There is not 1 song I could honestly say I loved. This album was made for some extra cash on the side & Beyonce's 2nd Project. Beyonce do ya thang girl get ya hustle on I ain't mad at cha but I am mad because you wasted my money but then again you didnt because now I'm using the album as a coaster.
4,WELL DONE!,"This album was well done. I see a lot of people think the opposite... I wonder if they are guys??? The majority of the songs on this one tells the stories of heartache, and other girlie things we go through. As a come back group album, they did a wonderful job! This follow up album is way better than some of the stuff being released by the ""OG's"" in the game. Great job DC!"
3,KARMA FULFILLED,"When i brought this Cd i was expected more than i get. Ok, Here you can find eleven tracks full of the same sound, the entire album sounds like just 1 song very slow and extensive. At least ""Soldier"" ""Lose my Breath"" and ""Throught with Love"" sounds a bit different. To be honest, ""Is She The Reason"" have good lyrics and is a interesting song, but as i said,all the cd sounds like the same...to me, more than Destiny this could be called Karma."
3,Like It...But Could've Been Better,"It's great that the ladies of Destiny's Child have taken a break from their solo careers to reunite and drop another bomb on the record buying public. And although their return has been nothing but positive, I feel that they should've taken more time putting this album together. I learned that this album was recorded in about three weeks(which, to me, is a pretty short period of time). While this album has it's fair share of tunes(i.e.: ""Lose My Breath"", ""Soldier"", ""Cater 2U"", ""T-Shirt"", and ""Girl""), it's mostly dominated by slow jams. Slow jams are cool, but where's the rest of the uptempos. Now DC may have amicably split for their return to solo territory. But if they happen to reunite many years from now, hopefully they return to their upbeat musical ways that they are known for."
3,Disappointing,"Don't let the hot first two singles ""Lose My Breath"" and ""Soldier"" fool you, Destiny Fulfilled has nothing else to offer. There are a few alright jams but nothing like their previous efforts, The Writings On The Wall and Survivor. I like that the group is trying new things and actually not bashing men on every song on this CD, but a lot of the songs turned out pretty boring.The hooks are bland and the girls have nothing to do but harmonize (which they do better than any girl group out there). ""Girl"" has good production, but is nothing special. The only other strong cut on this disc is ""Through With Love.""Reccommended if you're a Destiny's Child fan, but look elsewhere if not."
3,Don't judge too soon,"Well, I have never written a review before, but I felt I had to speak about this one. Now, I'm not gonna lie, when I first bought the album, I was ready to call Beyonce and them and get my money back. However, after several listens to the CD, it started to grow on me. It's not the same as previous cds cause all the booty-shakin is gone. (Why...who knows.) So, it's all mature and what not. Ok. You can have fast mature songs too. I give it 3 stars because you have to listen to it for about a week before you find your jams.There is really nothing memorable on the CD that will play forever like their old jams, but I give them credit for trying. If you are a DC fan, buy it (on sale) and let it spin for a few days. You will begin to feel a few of the songs. I still think the CD is kind of too mature for their audience, but what can you do."
1,Complete Bullsh*t,"I can't even begin to describe how bad this sucks. Why did they even make it?! It was just an excuse for Beyonce to once again take lead in MOST of the songs and sing about her relationship with Jay-Z!! What the hell happened to being indenpendent women?! This CD is not even worth burnin! Keep your money people because it's a complete waste of money, not to mention your time."
2,More like Destiny's garbage..........,"Im giving this album 2 stars for ""Soldier"",""Through with love"" and ""Lose my breath"" the rest of the songs are nothing special at all.......I have been a fan of DC3 since they first came out, I wanna know WHAT HAPPEND!?......They take only 3 weeks to record this album and it shows very much, this is nowhere near as good as their previous albums, and theirs only 1 upbeat song.......Their doing exactly what Beyonce did with her album ""Dangerously in love""..and speaking of her in the background vocals for alot of the songs she's on it and u can only hear her voice, i feel really bad for kelly and michelle........DC3 is releasing all the good singles first so that people will buy the album, well guess what?.....the laugh is gonna be on them cause this album is a joke, and i've lost ALOT of respect for them......"
3,2.5 stars,"it's a nice album overall but some of the tracks are skippable, which was not the case with survivor and writings on the wall at all. Lose My Breath was a great dance hit record but very unrepresentative of the album. The rest is full of ballads and soft hip hop tracks. Soldier was too damn overrated and has no melody to it. Cater to You has sweet music and a nice melody, t shirt and you are the reason are fillers; girl is really nice with a great melody, bad habit is a remake of usher's burn; if is a nice ballad but michelle's vocals ruin it, free is a filler track, through with love is the best song on this album with it's pianos and dancehall like beat, love is a filler. Download the songs I said are good and forget the rest. These ladies may be talented but after hearing this CD I think it's safe to say their destiny in their music career as a group has been fulfilled and I will forever have with me the memories of destiny's child music from high school up until the end of college"
2,Destiny Fulfilled,"I bought this disc after hearing the first single, Lose My Breathe & also hearing that Rodney Jerkins was involved in the project...only to discover that this is the only song he worked on. This album is as unevenly paced/produced as Beyonce's DIL!I feel like I was again bamboozled by the release of strong dance music only to find that the majority of the album is made up of mid-tempo r&b; grooves.I stand by my opinion that the best DC album is The Writings on the Wall - because some of the hottest songwriters & producers of that time worked on the album...Beyonce's songwriting skills are along par with Ashanti - both write simplistic songs but happen to get great beats to go along with them.The only songs that stand out to me are: Lose My Breath, Free, Soldier and Love. The rest makes the album sound like exactly what it is - a rush job."
2,Less Than Fulfilling,"Let me start off by saying that this is NOT a bad album. It's just a little misguided. This album is full of songs that are just ""ok"", not bad just ""ok"". It feels like they were saving the best for maybe their next album (or maybe Beyonce's next solo record), but songs like the infectious ""Soldier"", ""Lose My Breath"", and ""Cater 2 U"" bring back the classic R&B greatness of Destiny's Child. With constant slow ballads that draw out most of the album, you find yourself craving for more uptempo tracks like the first two songs from the album. The biggest surprise of all is that it is not Kelly or Beyonce (the obvious choice) who shines through the most, but it is in Michelle's raspy, sometimes child-like vocals that bring Destiny's Child to another level. Hardcore fans will eat up this album, the occasional Destiny's Child fan will enjoy most of the album, but if you had no desire in Destiny's Child before, then this album will not curve you on their side."
2,Destiny Dead,"I am listening to Lose My Breath right now. it is pretty much just a slut-off, and it's about them telling off stupid teens, but the video is three sets of Beyonce,Kelly,and Michelle in a dance fight with two sets in street clothes and purple suits until the real girls in mink and bras show up and whoop there butts. and the other girls do a cool rotine and blow there breath while the other sa ""you have no bissness in this Blah Blah you are dissmissed"""
4,you don't know what ur talking about,"enough with the negative reviews...i think too many people were expecting upbeat songs such as no no no and bugaboo. destiny's child is passed that phase now, and these songs are much more mature than singing about a man paying your bills. Personally, i think all the songs that were released singles suck with the exception of lose my breath which is just okay. VERY dissapointed in soilder and GIRL which is the worst song in the history of r&b; (in my opinion)the tracks that are good on this cd:cater to you, t-shirt, if, love, through with love, is she the reason.lose my breath, soilder, bad habit, and girl are WAY too commercial for my liking.another downfall, is that they did not put enough tracks on the cd. i wouldn't pay 13.99 for 11 songs."
3,Their Destiny is FULFILLED...,"Well they didn't title this CD Destiny Fulfilled for no reason. This is the last CD that Destiny's Child will make. It is a good effort, just not up to par with ""The Writings on the Wall"" or even ""Survivor."" It's too much Beyonce, not enough Michelle and second-rate Kelly vocals. Why would Beyonce come back to do another DC album when has blown up! (She's very loyal to her girls...but that's it for them) For the album...it's just ok. I was expecting a lot more from them...but I guess it's cuz they've ""grown up."" In any case, get it just to say you bought the last DC cd out there."
4,"This good, but not excellent!","He lacks Cd something, something with what they are characterized this fact like to the slight one and it doesn't contain anything innovative this repetitive and boring, anything overcomes to that made with Survivor that was one of the best albums in the moment in the 2001 all its songs Hit's they went at world level in all ways I am not an alone fan of them of beyonce."
2,WOW...what happened?.....,"I LOVE Destiny's Child...BUT this CD...big disappointment. The best songs on the entire CD were probably Lose My Breath,Cater 2 U and Girl...big disappointment...i just wasnt feeling the CD when i bought it..."
2,Very disapoointing,"I totally agree with what b-rocker said about this album. It is so poor and I was gutted when I first heard it. Destinys child can do so much better (and in the past they have) I am one of DC's biggest fans. Ive seen them and boyence (solo) in concert 3 times and im going again next summer, But I hope that they dont perform many songs on this album. The first two tunes are fantastic, but the rest of the cd- well dont bother!! What a shame!"
3,Why?,"The fans deserve SO much better especially this being their last album.I feel(my opinion)that they didn't put their hearts into it.Seems like something they threw up.Cater 2 U,Bad Habit,Soldier,T-Shirt,and Loose My Breathe seems to be the only songs worth listening to.They didn't have many tracks on the album and they didn't even give a dedication to A.T.(If you don't know who I'm talking about look at the end of all their albums.)BUT if you are a fan like me and just wanna collect all their albums you can but I'm just letting you know it was a huge disappointment to me."
2,Only three good songs...,"There are only three good songs on the C.D.! Don't get it, it is a waste of money."
2,No Wonder The Broke Up,"On this CD, Destiny's Child shows that they no longer have the ""it"" factor. Mid-tempo song after Mid-tempo song shows that they feel they need to slow down their sound to seem more mature. Lose My Breath is basically the only good song on the CD. Destiny's Child used to sing songs with a ""I am woman hear me roar"" theme but now their songs are more submissive ""let me serve you"" type songs. What happened!? it makes no sense to me. I just hope the they have more luck apart."
2,Not the same DC we once knew...,This CD just doesn't have the same flare as the others. You can tell they are growing up and so are their tones and lyrics. The whole CD sounds like it was taped in a few hours or separate sessions and they just put the mess together. But each member is in a new place in their life that it really shows in the songs and lack of cohesiveness. Its a shame that its easy to dislike more songs than like them. I hope this is their last CD... for their sake.
2,it sucked,this is not a good cd it could be a lot gooder then what it is and michelle has to go she is not good at all she sucks and hope that all of u that c this thinks so as well she just do not fit in wit beyonce& kelly so put home girl out ok and why do she saing so much on this album? the only songs i like a lot is t-shirt and is she the reason and soldier is ok but the 1 on the radeio is the good one the 1 on the cd is to long and girl is ok and love thats it dont buy this cd it will put u to sleep it just not good
2,Letoya and Letavia u are missed still,"This cd was rushed you can definately tell, Kelly's song is one of the better ones lyrically and sound wise, but if, and free are good because I like the vibe. Michelle was made a fool of because she was allowed to sing a smidget more on this album all together she song about two verses and they were the verses that Beyonce felt she might mess up on so she allowed michelle to cackle through them. Michelle stick with gospel because your voice better compliments it and people write according to what you can sing and not what Beyonce can. P.s. sorry about your fall and your unconcerned group members, but you are an hourly worker so the show must go on.The fakeness has to stop because there is no real love there.Letoya's single is great and we finally got the chance to see why beyonce was so intimidated, toya has a nice voice and it make B sound as if she is screaming more.If this is the end for them cool. I still paid for the cd though so i have to listen to it."
3,Still not fufilled,"Ok, so I tried to give the cd some time to grow on me. Unfortunatley, I'm still not impressed. There are a couple of good songs on the cd.Lose My Breath 8/10 catchySoldier 3/10 the beat was good but this song and video is a pure joke! soooooooo fake!Cater 2 U 2/10 this song is pitiful!T-shirt 3/10 Another pitiful song but the beat is okIs She the Reason 7/10 Ok song, nice beat. Michelle sounds terrible on this songGirl 0/10 Just Terrible!Bad Habit 7/10 OKIf 9/10 Very good song and nice harmonyFree 7/10 OkThrough With Love 10/10 The BEST song on this albumLove 6/10 Boring and forgettableOverall this cd gets a 6/10. Beyonce is still dominating most of the cd (even though she lets Kelly and Michelle get a turn to sing). And Michelle, no no no! Kelly is ok."
3,Just Not Their Best Work,"I am a true DC fan. I loved their previous CD's and their solo projects. I like their style and other things they are involved in. HOWEVER, I must speak on the Destiny Fulfilled CD itself. Something is missing. It seems rushed and not well put together. The songs all sound the same. They are rather bland. I am not feeling this CD at all. I gave it a 3 simply because I still like DC, but the CD is probably a 2."
3,Glad they are back!,"I was so excited to see another album come out of the trio of Destiny's Child. However, the first album is definitely much better than Destiny Fulfilled. It is a two disc album, #2 being a bonus disc. The second disc mostly contains remakes/remixes of the other album. I definitely enjoyed all of the songs on this CD set, but can't say that it is at the top of my list. I hope there is still more to come from Destiny's Child."
2,Fulfilled.........maybe,"I've listened to every DC3 cd. This one just seems like they threw it together.I KINDA THOUGHT THEY PUT OUT THIS CD JUST TO SAY THAT THEY WHERE STILL TOGETHER. THAT THE FAME THAT ONE OF THE GROUP MEMBERS WHERE EXPERIENCING,DID NOT CHANGE ANYTHING, BUT IT DID. Almost like they put out the songs that sounded the best on to this cd. There was really no variety.Six of the last songs where all about the pain of relationships, all in a row. I think that thats kinda strange I never seen them do that on any other cd. I thought they could have made some more uplifting songs, or some more club bangers could have made the cd better.The 4 best songs on the cd where: Solider, Lose my Breath, Threw with Love, and Love."
2,Destiny Unfufilled,"I have had this CD for quite some time now and it just does not grow on me. The OK songs include ' Through With It Love', ' Free' and 'Cater 2 U'. The song ' Girl' reminds me of 'Me, Myslef and I, which i don't particularly like. Their songs are lyrically challenged. (e.g.Cater 2 U - 'Let me help you take of your shoes, untie your shoe string...' & Girl- i'm your girl you're my girl, we're all girls don't you know that we love ya.....) please how tacky. The CD is rather boring actually, with 'Lose My Breath' being the only catchy track. The others are just 'filler' tracks in my opinion. It is good to see the group re-united but this disc is not good. Let's hope that they release some remixes to these bland tracks. This attempt was just not good enough."
2,Looks like their destiny has been fulfilled...,"...as crap.What happened to their energy and their unique sound?? All the songs on here are all extremely generic R&B; songs. Granted I can see that they wanted to mature their sound a bit or something, but come ON. This is slow...and useless. I could pick up ANY girl R&B; group, and get the same effect as this album.I like Lose My Breath and Through With Love. That's about it. All the other songs are just kind of their, and I just don't get my groove on with any of it.I have to say I'm disappointed. It leaves me wondering if Beyonce killed the group's sound with her solo CD, because THAT sounded just like Destiny's Child. Makes sense though, since Beyonce's father is their manager. Go figure.I wouldn't buy this. I don't like it. It unfulfilling, and generic smokescreen.Ah well, what can you do. *shrugs*"
5,Michelle has the best voice in DC.,"Michelle is the best singer in Destiny's child, because if you listen to all of the destiny's child cd she is the only one who stang up. I am sick and tired of hiring that michelle sucks have you guys listen to her last album is amazing!! this album kills kelly's and beyonce ( sorry ) michelle has dome musical in AID, and i hear that she is going to be in the next spider man movie. so and i am sure that she would rock as a solo artis and she would change the way we listen to music so to all of ya hatterrrs keep hating. Michelle 1!!!"
2,destiny fulfilled,"I love destinys childs. I have bought all of their albums and been to two of their concerts. I thought this album was very disapointing. The two best songs on the album are the ones they released, ""soilder"" and ""loose my breath"". This is not the normal destiny childs music. I'm very upset I wasted my money on this album. All they talk about is love and their man. What happened to the independant women who didn't need anybody for anything. Thats why I loved destinys child, because they didn't need anybody but themselves. Now it's a diiferent story. I hope they get their act together because I lost some respect for them from this album."
3,Growing on me...,"Honestly, I love DC3 and I plan on seeing them live in concert. This is partly due to the fact that Beyonce' just shines and she'll make sure the tour is tight even if no one else does. Everyone has to admit that Bee is just the leading lady and the group seems more like ""Beyonce' and her Kids"". I felt like Kelly stepped up with her vocals (good job), Michelle still needs some help to stop sounding so scared(bad job). Beyonce' held back a little more and I'm sure she just didn't want to over-power the other girls. Maybe it was a stunt to make sure they got another album out, maybe it was the rush of saying ""now we're grown so let's change it up and put out something, it's been 3 years"". You can tell at least Kelly and Beyonce' are in love with somebody... it's oozing out of every track. A more mature sound and they recieved 3 stars from me just because I like a total of 3 songs on the album.1) T-Shirt2) Free3) Love"
3,destiny was only half fulfilled,"When I heard the girls were back, I was expecting the talent I heard on their old albums (Survivor). But I was disappointed by what I heard with the new album. Destiny was only half fulfilled, with quite a few flaws.The best song on the album is definitely ""Lose my Breath"". I was expecting all the other songs to sound that good, but they didn't. Beyonce's talent surpasses that of Kelly and Michelle by a lot. She's attractive, talented, and the backbone of the group. Kelly is pretty talented too, but her voice isn't nearly as good as Beyonce's (in my opinion). But you get good results when you have them share verses and their voices blend well together.Now Michelle is something else. Her voice is really different than Kelly's and Beyonce's. I'm not saying it's not good, but when listening to their songs, hers stands out and you listen much closer. She should stick to gospel music because I don't think she's Destiny's Child material.so overall, I'd rate this album 3/5."
1,This CD was really bad!,"I'm not an avid DC fan, but I liked ""Soilder"" so I bought the CD from Target (it was on sale for 9.99). There is one song that I like and that is the last track called ""Love""...the rest of this CD is hot garbage! I'm on Beyonce' overload and I'm tired of hearing constantly taking over the entire song (leading, background vocals, you name it she's there!). Michelle's voice doesn't match the groups, she has this blusey sound to her and it's just not a good fit. The couple songs where Kelly did sing, she sounded really bad to me. I hope this is the last CD by DC, I don't know that I can stand another one!"
3,75/100 - Survivor was heaps better! But still good!,"1. Lose My Breath - Typically a great Destiny's Child song 9/102. Soldier - Great R&B; track - 7.5/103. Cater 2 U - Soothing song for anytime of the day - 8/104. T-Shirt - Not a top song, but alright - 5/105. Is She the Reason? - Nice old-school sounding track - 7/106. Girl - Takes a few listens before liking it - 5/107. Bad Habit - 2nd best track on the album ""GO Kelly"" - 9/108. If - Don't know how the track made the album - 2/109. Free - Very strong song - 8/1010. Through With Love - Hope to see this a single - 10/1011. Love - Not a very good track - 1.5/1012. Game Over - Just another fill in track - 1/1013. Why You Actin'? - An O.K song - 5/10"
2,Beyonce contradicts herself and Destiny's Child is lame,"Ok... Beyonce sings about being a very independent woman and being a Survivor but she's singing about have a ghetto thug in Soldier to make her complete and that she will slave over a man in Cater 2 You? She lacks substance in her music and she's contradicts herself. There's a better word for this a Hypocrite. First of all, the Destiny's Child girls are from a upper middle class neighborhood in Texas but they're dressing up as ghetto girls in the Soldier video? And they're singing about that they want a ghetto thug as a boyfriend. No girl wants a ghetto dude as a boyfriend. They mays sell more albums than most girls groups but TLC, the Supremes, and En Vogue and even latin freestyle girl groups from the 1980's like the Cover Girls, Sweet Sensation, Seduction, Expose have more substance in their music and lyrics."
1,Good thing I didn't buy it,"I'm not hating on destiny's child because I'm not a fan, I must admit they do have catchy songs but this album is a HUGE dissapointment. I borrowed it from one of my friends because i liked the first single ""Lose my breath"" and I can tell you that besides that I only liked two other songs. ""Soldier"" and ""Through with love"" and that's it! What happened to them? Even their previous album ""Survivor"" was better than this. I expected it to be great since Beyonce is what seems to keep the group together vocally and lyrically. These girls should've took longer to complete this album properly, most of their beats are old school but i miss the dance hits. I hope for the next album they'll do a better job"
2,OOOOOMMMMMGGGG!?!?!?!?!,"yo dogg i been dey fan b4.....but man dis thang is so dissapointing......and i'm just 14 and i noe dat dis CD is horrible......only song worth hearing is ""THROUGH WITH LOVE"".....all da other songs are bad,bad,bad......anotha thing is dat dis CD still sounds like one of Beyonce's CD's 4real.....she always all up on all da tracks .....I'm jus dissapointed and i feel like kelly is veryu conceited now and michelle is bout to be out......and beyonce is such a diva in disquise.....das wat i'm thinkin.....and also i wonder why b is talkin bout through with love den sayin she dangerously in love {HahHum}"
2,What happened?,"After Lose My Breath, it's all downhill. Beyonce, you weren't raised in the 'hood, so why go there with your lyrics? And if having a love life produces this kind of maturity, then go back to your ""Independent Women"" status. Get back to work ladies and give us better next time."
1,They aren't legit,3 Horrible looking manufactured girls.How can ANYBODY seriousallyenjoy this???This shouldn't be allowed to record anymore!
1,THEY SUCK LIKE THIS ALBUM,THE GIRLS COULD HAVE DID A LOT BETTER COUSE THIS CD SUCKS BIG TIME I LIKE 2 SONGS ON HEAR DONT BUY THIS S**T YOU WILL WANT YOUR MONEY BACK AND WHY DID THEY LET THAT OUTHER OLD BIT*H SAING? YALL KNOW WHO I AM TALKING BOUT I DONT THINK I HAVE TO SAY HER NAME BUT IT STARS WITH A .M. LOL BUT DONT GET THIS BULL S**T IT SUCKSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
3,Just not what I expected =-(,"BAsed on the previous albums I have to say that this was the nail in the coffin for the end of their careers. I mean with an album like this it's a wonder why Beyonce' bothered... it's her album. I mean to have Michelle sing bridges and have Kelly lucky to sing one verse it's quite embarssing. The reality is that no album touches ""The Writing's On The Wall"" that was a great concept album... this which was also, supposed to be a concept album. But these tracks did not flow one from the other.******************************************All I can say is if you a die hard DC fan than you'll love it. If you just tend to groove with DC than this isn't the alum to pick up... it'll make you glad you didn't pick up any others. Don't let this album taint the others."
5,Destiny for LIFE!! I LOVE THEM TO DEATH!! I LOVE U Beyonce Knowles!!,"Anyone who has ever seen a single Destiny's Child video or performance knows that these ladies mean business. They are like women with lyrical whips, doling out punishment to all the players out there. Beyonce, Kelly and Michelle -- the new (and final) Destiny's Child -- have taken ""girl power"" to a whole new level thanks to their sexy image, amazing moves, hard work, and unbelievable talent. We just can't get enough of them, and it seems that neither can their millions of worldwide fans"
4,I Love It,"In my opinion, vocally this is Destiny's Child's best album although they could've gave it more. All the girls can really SANG! and it shows on this album. But I feel as though they were holding back. I don't think that 3 weeks is enough time to create an album. But the album is really catchy and mellow. People are disappointed with the lack of party songs, but I don't really care. It's a nice album.1. Lose My Breath (infectious) 9/102. Soldier featuring T.I and Lil' Wayne (could've left it off) 7/103. Cater 2 U ( I really love this song) 9/104. T-Shirt (So Sexxy!) 10/105. Is She The Reason (Please be the next single) 10/106. Girl (Catchy) 8.5/107. Bad Habit (Hot) 9/108. If (The best song off the album) 10/109. Free (OK) 7.5/1010. Through With Love (Hott!!) 10/1011. Love (Boring) 8/10"
1,GARBAGE!,"I want my damn money back. I cannot believe that Destiny's Child had the nerve to put this crap out. ""Lose My Breath"" was an okay song. Seeing them perform it live made me amped up to buy the cd. ""Soldier"" was okay...but then i actually heard the words and I was like wtf! Then I saw the video! That is not the Destiny's Child I fell in love with years ago. What are they doing! Can you say ghetto! And then Cater 2 U, jesus christ what happened to independent women! This cd was pure garbage. I bought the cd and literally skipped every song after soldier. I was like this cannot be good...there's only 11 songs! The ONLY song that redeemed this album was ""Through With Love"". I praised God when I heard this song. That song represents Destiny's Child to me. This is the only song I really liked on this whole entire album. One SONG! I am so disappointed. DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM! They can do so much better."
4,desteny's child,ya know how to sing perty good. I love all of ya'lls songs.I HOPE THAT THE NEXT SONG YA MAKE COMES good. weel take care and i hope to listen to ya'll music perty soon in the radio.
1,Destiny NOT Fulfilled...,"There is only one reason why this album should ever have surfaced...and it's ""Cater 2 U."" The rest of the album is a huge disappointment but so has DC ever since after their first breakup. I never thought these girls could go wrong but once they split up (the first time) they lost the magic. ""Lose My Breath"" is OK but it really has no substance; fun to listen to but can get old very easily. I'd recommend downloading the two songs listed, not the actual album."
3,WHAT HAPPENED????,"Ok, I love Destiny's Child and I support them in what they do but I have to be COMPLETELY HONEST. This album was probably the worst in all DC Albums. They lost that energy and fun and they started going slow and old style ""yawn"". Michelle only sings bridges which is unfair because she has an amazing voice which you can hear in ""Girl"". I'm happy Kelly got her own song but that doesn't make up for all the parts Beyonce sings. I love Beyonce and she's probably my favorite member but everyone has a unique voice which they should be able to express. I am truly sad though that Destiny's Child is ending cus I love them from the bottom of my heart. Changes aren't always the best and I wish that they could of made another album with that same style in songs like ""Say My Name"", ""Bugaboo"", and ""Bootylicious""(Maybe not the same innapropriate lyrics of Bootylicious but the same catchy beat and style). Over all an OK album but not what I expected."
4,Great Album,"Not sure why the negative comments are posted, I really enjoyed this CD. Of course, it's hard to find a CD where all of the songs are good, however, I enjoyed more than half of them. Lose My Breath, Soldier, Cater 2 U, Girl, Is She the Reason, If and Through with Love are all very good songs.I don't understand why people are taking the songs so seriously though. Music is entertainment and we shouldn't get offended if someone wants to sing about ""Cater""-ing to their men. If what's in the news is true, all of these women have found new love and love makes you say some crazy things. Good job Destiny's Child."
2,Destiny fullfilled in 30 days....,I think that their album....sucks...I was expecting more from these super trio and what that I get... an albim full of crap....Okay fine Lose My Breath was good but all the other songs have no energy at all.I think that the album was made only in 30 days.Where is the power?The groove?The energy?Oh please!! No offence but Beyonce going solo is'nt such a bad idea! It would evern be better for her career...moving onI think that it would be a waste of money to buy their latest album.It would be better to just wait till these trio produce a better album.Coz I think that their album waS A rush!
2,destiny NOT fullfilled,THIS CD IS GOOD FOR WHEN U ARE.... GOING TO SLEEP.THEIR ARE NO BOOTYSHAKIN SONGS ON THIS ALBUM EXCEPT FOR LOSE MY BREATH AND SOLDIER.EVERY OTHER SONG ON THIS ALBUM LACKS.BORING.NOTHING LIKE WRITINGS ON THE WALL AND SURVIVOR.PS.BEYONCE... STOP TAKING ALL THE LIMELIGHT.MICHELLE AND KELLY DESERVE SOME TOO.
4,not their best but still great!,"destiny's child are back with a new album.this album is more grown-up than their previous albums.there are many great tracks here like:-lose my breathe,through with love,cater to you,soldier.my fave track is ofcourse through with love,it's a great track and one of their best.buy this album if you love DC,it's not dissapointing like other reviewers say,only it's full of slower songs.I love you girls,keep up the good work."
3,WHAT HAPPENED TO THEIR STYLE!!!,"I Love the album, it is very mature for the ladies but after hearing ""lose My Breath"" I was expecting the classic Dc with the fast singing and killer beatz. Instaed, the album is full of old r&b soul samples. Although their vocals are INCREDIBLE! I expected for Michelle to have at least one song for her self like Kelly did (Bad Habit). The Best Songs are: Lose My Breath, Soldier, Cater 2 U, Is She The Reason, Girl & Through With Love"
2,Save your money. Buy yourself a new copy of Survivor!,"Ughhh... yeah I was thrilled when I heard Destiny's Child would be coming out with a new CD... excited when I heard ""Lose My Breath""... enthused when I heard ""Through With Love""... and disappointed as all when I heard the rest. I'm admittedly not an R&B fan, but I loved 2001's Survivor, every track was awesome. Now listening to this is such a let down. These ladies have the best voices in the business and what I thought were good heads on their shoulders. To allow a record to come out looking like a teen pop album with the liner notes denoting who sings what (like you couldn't tell), and songs that sound like they were done on the fly.. I can't find a reason to buy this album! You would be better off buying the tracks you like from Itunes. If this is the last CD of Destiny's Child, and how they'll be remembered (except for Beyonce' of course), they should have just left it after 8 Days of Christmas.."
2,Destiny's Suicide,"Destiny's Child was the group we guys loved to hate. With their sassy {men are no good} and {we can take care of our selves} lyrics. But it seems they sold out. Allava sudden the same girls saying they want real men, want thugs instead. Where'd that come from. Beyonce YOU CAN't CATER to me. ...... Not that I mind catering, but that don't even sound right comin from her. Seems like they lost they're fire. Beyonce's album was {2 me} your typical Destiny's Child album. Alotta folk hate Beyonce, but ..... she really does {at least seem to} carry the group. Kelly's album Floped. Now that their image has changed Michelle has lost some of her Christian fanbase too. Beyonce should've never released a solo album. Cause now that she has, in comparision to this garbage, I now hope she goes Solo. For Good."
4,Pretty Good!,"this album is aight, but it lacks something from there last LP's. Michelle 's voice doesn't shine enough on the album. her voice is beautiful and so is kelly's. Beyonce's is out shining the other two. otherwise I love this album.My Top 5:1.lose my breath2.through with love3.is she the reason4.cater 2 u5.t- shirtDestiny's child has almost been fufilled."
2,WHY???????????????????????????????,"Through the years I have enjoyed a select few Destiny's Child songs. ""Bill, Bills, Bills"" and ""Independent Women"" to name a few. When I listen to their latest effort, I am deeply saddened. I am saddened by the fact that some artists are so market driven and this LP showcases that mind-set. While ""Loose My Breathe"" and ""Soldier"" are two outstanding numbers, the rest of the album reminds me of album filler and it's just that. There's nothing here that stands out and makes me loose my breathe. In today's music world there are very few artists that focus on what is felt in their soul. Most of today's artists focus on what is popular at the time. While that is important it is also important to appeal to the souls of the buyer and this Destiny's Child effort falls very short of that. The Destiny has truly not been fullfilled and with this latest effort, I don't think it ever will be."
4,DC fan fulfilled,"omg i am in love with this cd. finally they have come into their own and become the epic group they have tried so many years to establish. the harmonies they sing blend so well and make each song that much more great to listen to. the tracks that really stand out for me are Lose My Breath (of course), Soldier, T-Shirt, Is She The Reason, Girl, If and Love. the rumors of them just being a Beyonce-fied group are so false after listening to this because each member of the group has their own part in EACH song. and if you dont believe me, just look at the lyrics in the booklet because it defines who is singing what. much love to DC and im so glad they are back because the hip-hop world has been missing you for awhile."
4,A more mature Destiny Child.,"Destiny Fulfilled is their first cd i can listen to from start to finish. At a first listen, the cd is a disappointment. There is only 11 tracks(2 bonus tracks at some stores but the songs are only ok).You would think the whole cd would be like the singles but ""Lose my breathe"" and ""Soldier"" are the most upbeat songs. After a while i adjusted to the sounds of Destiny Fulfilled. The biggest adjustment is Michelle's voice. Her voice doesn't fit the group at first listen. What makes this cd different from the rest is how the songs song more grown up. The other cd's where good but had kiddy songs. The cd is more slow and calm. Kelly's voice is very good but Beyonce's is really really good. My favorites are Girl, Free, and Love. The only bad thing about this cd is it feels like something is missing But it is still their best in my opinion."
2,What a waste of time,"Well, what can i say? I didn't bought the album but i borrowed it form my cousin. I heard all the songs but at the end of the cd i fell to sleep. After the track #2 that is ""Soldier"" the album become slow and boring. Until it gets to track # 10 ""Through with love."" The rest is useless, boring and just not good, that gets me the impression that Beyonce dies to make her new album as a solo artist and that made this album just to console the other two girls of the group. Shame on you Beyonce or is that you are saving the best songs for your next album?Don't buy this album, get ""Writings on the wall"" or ""Survivor"" or one from TLC or WHATEVER...instead of this."
2,Very Unfortunate,"This album leaves a lot to be desired. I too fell for the ""Lose my Breath"" excitement, and can report that its the only hummable track on the entire CD. How they could expect to get away with this is beyond me. I really adore Michelle's voice and they totally marginalize her here, which come to think of it is not out of the ordinary. Kelly sounds terrible and Beyonce hogs the stage yet again. I love Beyonce, but someone should remind her that shes in a GROUP. Thats why its called that. If she wanted to take over the reins, she could just continue doing her solo stuff. This sounds like some crappy R&B-lite stuff that Beyonce would make, about ten times worse than the icky ballads on ""Dangerously in Love"". STAY AWAY."
2,Worst Album Of Destinys Child,"I Am Going To Rant Now Because I Bought This Album First Off Expecting More Than 11 Tracks. Getting Over That This Has To Be The Worst Destinys Child Album Ever. Their Other Albums Were A Mix Of Slow And Fast And Full Of Independant Woman Thoughts. Now We Have Cater2U Which Is Just Crap. The Vocals Are Brilliant But Lyrics Are Bland. Lose My Breath, If, Love And Is She The Reason Are Passable Songs. The Only Song I Truly Enjoy On This Album Has To Be Through With Love. Great Vocals And Great Lyrics.If This Is Their Last Album I Am Truly Disappointed They Finished This Way.."
4,It's Alright,"This album is ok. I love some of the songs ""Free"" Is she the reason"" and ""Soldier"" Some of the solos could have been left out. I personally hate Michelle's voice it sounds like she sucked on a helium ballon and then sang. Kelly did well and of course B was blowin as always! If you like this the whole pop/ R&B you will like this album."
2,"""Destiny Fulfilled!""","This is the latest album from the best selling girl groups of the 90's titled ""Destiny's Child,"" and you can tell that something is missing from this album such as great vocals and the sassy beats and attitude from previous albums such as ""The Writings Of The Wall"" and ""Survivor."" Also, you can tell that Beyonce didn't really wanna come back to Destiny's Child and her voice lets us all know it. Also, you will notice how EACH member of the group will have a solo in EVERY song and Michelle just isn't cutting it. This is NOT really that good. I didn't buy it, I downloaded it thinking it would be good and then if it was, I'd buy it. No I will NOT buy it and I will DELETE it from my computer because it's taking up space where I can put something else on it!! Girl's give us a break!!"
2,Destiny fulfilled indeed!,"Wow! Like, oh my god, it doesn't sound like anything else on the radio! Whatever. It does. Too bad though, they are talented. Wouldn't it would be nice (for once) to see major R&B artists take the sound and spirit in a fresh new direction............."
4,the truth about destiny fulfilled,yes we are all use 2 hearin just hot beats and club bangin songs from destiny's child but it was time for them to right there personal album.christina aguilera/usher/kelly clarkson/fantasia/ashanti has done this and it was their time people dont like the album because to many slow songs but if u take ur time and listen to it u will love it cuz b4 i didnt like as well now its all i listen to besides ciara-goodies
2,Why DC?????!!!!,"I love Destiny's Child especially my girl Beyonce but I'm so disappointed in this album. The only good songs are ""If"", ""Is She the Reason"", and ""Cater 2 U"". ""Is She the Reason"" is straight and I don't like the lyrics in ""Cater 2 U"" only the vocals and the beat. I think ""If"" has beautiful harmonies, vocals, everthing (except Michelle's part). I'm sorry but Michelle is not bringing anything to the table. She can't sing, dance, and she doesn't really have any looks. I'm sure she's a very nice person but she shouldn't be in Destiny's Child."
2,monotonous,"most of the rhythms behind all of these songs are identical. all of the songs sound the same! you would be better off buying ""dangerously in love"" by beyonce-shes the only voice you really hear on this album anyway!!"
4,Disappointed but Fulfilled,"1. Short Album; I really expected at least a 15 track album.2. Great vocals. They sound magnificent. The songs that really are the best are 'Cater 2 U' and 'Through With Love' but I feel that they made a good decision to release 'Lose My Breath' and 'Soldier' as simultaneous singles because they appeal most to their audience.3. More Variety; the album was very one-sided. I would of like to heard different styles of music other than the slow jams.4. Luring and Unique. Even though the CD is not what everyone expected, I think that the songs are still great. They'll never let us down. Also, the concept of the CD was a brilliant idea.Expectations for next album - I think that the next album should be longer and have more #1 hits. I dont think that they shuold wait another 4 years but it's worth the wait. Also, I'm looking forward to another Beyonce album. Can't wait for the U.S. tour. Go DC-3!; you girls did great."
3,Not too sure what to think...,"I have been a big fan of Destiny's Child since the ladies first started rockin it out years ago, but this Cd has me pretty confused as to what direction these ladies are heading in. Lose My Breath and Soldier are rockin beats, but then the rest of the cd has a more, mellow, NOT Destiny's Child Feel to it !! I bought the Cd to be supportive of these ladies who I have mega-respect for but I wouldn't recommend it, I would say get the singles for Lose My Breath and Soldier, or download them but don't buy the CD, I will have the two songs playing a lot and that will probably be it ! Sorry Diva's but I'm just not feelin the new vibe !"
4,Get the Japanese edition of FULFILLED... It's worth the $$$$,"11 tracks, as good as they are, just ain't enough DC3 for me. For about $30 US (including shipping and handling), I ordered the Japanese version of FULFILLED (from Amazon Japan) featuring the Darkchild-produced gem GOT'S MY OWN (which, by the way, has some excellent beats) and the sexy slow jams GAME OVER and WHY YOU ACTIN? 14 tracks in total, way better than the US edition, and worth the extra cash!"
1,Not Worth The Wait or The Cost,"I'm so sorry but I tried to make myself like this album but it's just not good. Maybe two good songs and that's it. I am still a fan of this group but not this cd. All three ladies are talented beautiful singers and I hope the best for them but I just have to be honest. Now we hear news of their soon to be breakup and maybe it's best. Beyonce, Kelly, and Michelle good luck on future solo albums..We'll all be waiting....."
3,More mature,"This is the more mature side of Destiny's Child and it's kind of scary because it almost seems like a farewell album. It is really mellow as the only two energetic songs (Lose My Breath and Soldier)are at the very beginning. It wasn't what I expected but I mean that in a good way. However, most of the songs are kind of ""I love my man"", ""anything for my man"" and ""I can't believe he went there"" which leaves the listener wondering what about the woman you've become? Is she really THAT dependent on a man?"
3,Destiny's wost unfulfilled album.,"Destinys child is one of the top selling girl groups in the U.S. And they really proved it on there last two albums, but this one is just lagging.To start off with michelle and kelly sing way to much kelyy is okay sometimes but michelle sounds like a drunken alley cat.The only good song an the album are lose my breath, soilder, t-shirt, cater 2 you, through with love, and love. Thats almost half of them with only 11 songs you could see were they tried two rush the album which took them 11 days to complete. I think Beyonce's solo album was far better than destinys fulfilled."
3,I'd like to give it 3 1/2,"This album is not nearly as good or bad as many reviewers make it out to be. The members of the group have all branched out and done their own thing, and it's got to be hard to reunite after an extended hiatus. Destiny's Child tries a more grown-up approach on this album, and it works . . . on some cuts. I love the mid-tempo feel of ""Love"" and I can play ""If"" all day. ""Is She the Reason"" and ""Girl"" are also good to me. Songs like ""T-shirt"" and ""Cater 2 U"" are garbage if you ask me and the first two singles aren't my favorites but I can get through them in the car or someting--no active listening. I'd consider the weak tracks filler, but it seems like the group has put some work into the songs with excellent production . . . It's just that the lyrics have no substance or purpose. Overall, I give this album a pass even though most were expecting more from the group. It's worth having for the good songs, just skip through the bad songs."
4,Great Album,"This album was definitely different but still a great album. It is very personable and real. If you listen to the lyrics, you can feel what the ladies are coming from and the problems they have gone through (mostly Beyonce) in their relationships. I love the CD.But then again, I am a lyricist. My favorite songs: Lose my Breath, Soldier, Cater 2 U, Enough, Is she the Reason, Girl. This is a great album. These ladies have matured and it shows!"
3,Its Ok,"Its and okay album, but most of the songs are slow or a bit boring. Although you do come across a few good slow songs here and there. The best songs have to be:1. Lose My Breath2. Through With Love3. Love4. T-Shirt"
3,Needs improvement,"My Main issues with this Dual-Disc Re-release of Destiny's Child are the following1. Girl (Video) - They put this out before that video was released. Should have waited2. The DVD side - The audio portion contains Game Over and Why You Actin' - International album tracks. They left off ""Gots my own"", Another international track and Also, They are not on the CD side. It's one thing to add them on The DVD side only if they exceed the 80 minute CD limit but they don't. They should have been on the CD side for us Ipod and Mp3 player owners3. 2 Step - Another Album cut wasn't added. These 4 left off tracks do not exceed the 80 minute CD limit. They should have been added onThis review only gets 3 stars because the original 11 American CD tracks still make a great album. But this really isn't a good re-release"
2,"DESTINY HALF-FILLED, NOT FULFILLED...","Only 11 tracks...enough saidLoose My breath and Cater 2 U, are the only great songs on this album. The album sounds rushed. I think they rushed to get this album out, just so Beyonce' could get her second album out. Destiny's Child no longer exists. Beyonce' is like a spider, she lewers you in with her music and booty poppin', then traps you in her web.And I have a question, ""Why is it always Beyonce', Kelly, then Michelle in every song. They always leave her out of the groove of the songs with those two second bridges. Save your money. This is not Destiny's Child...Sorry 2 all the fans."
4,Wonderfully Produced,"I rather enjoyed this album. The Survivor album was so Pop-laiden that we forgot about the real Destiny's Child. This album is one that shows adulthood and no more lame songs. I like this album because it's realistic. The beats are more relaxed and not so dance clubbish. Good work girls!Urr umm Michelle should only sing with more of an ambience on her voice or maybe not at all. Although, on some songs she sounds very nice but others like ""Is She the Reason""...oh God no, she sounds like she just came back from a wild night of partying and screaming with all the scratchiness in her voice. Beyonce blows me away everytime! She makes the songs what they are literally, seeing as though she did most of the vocal production and arranging also and most of the harmonies and ad-libs! LOL!I say when u have the X-factor, you just have it. Kelly's great but without Bee...there would be no real star power in DC3. Let's just face it! Great work Ladies..."
1,SUCKS!!!!!,"This CD TOTALLY SUCKS when compared to their former CDs.WHAT HAPPENED!!!!?????I love their old CDs but this one is CRAP!!! Has all but 2 good songs on it and that's it.. the rest of them are just slow crap... songs that sound like there just thrown together... just for the sake of putting out a cd for sale.They need to try harder next time before the're known as ""Destiny Finished"" or stick to their Solo Careers... Beyonce is Bad all by herself!!!Kelly is cool too!!.... but i'm not a big fan of Michelle's voice...."
3,Semi-okay,"The only reason I'm giving this album 3 stars is only because I love Beyonce's voice and Kelly's gracefulness. Technically this album should be a 1-2 rating. Why? Michelle is the absolute worst singer in the group. 1. She messes up a perfectly good song towards the end. 2. Every time she sings you miss the original better Destiny's Child with Latavia & LaToya. Why did the group do antoher album. Beyonce is to the point all she needs to do is focus on her solo career. When the original two broke away, it should have been only B and Kelly together or solo and no no-talent Michelle who also sings the worst gospel ever also."
3,ok,"It's an ok album, I skip around a lot I've heard better songs from these girls individually than what's on the album"
4,Not the greatest..but not garbage,"The first time through, I had my doubts. I only got it because ""Soldier"" is my anthem song for the year. After a few listens though, this album really grows on you. I don't know what these men are doing to Beyonce and Kelly, but some of the songs are a joke. ""Cater 2 You"" ...get serious...never in your dreams, so please stop giving these men false hope. Despite the few contrite lapses into adoration for the men in their lives, DC's latest project won't be winning Grammy's but it's ok to workout to or listen to during Saturday errands."
1,Pure garbage,"This is the biggest musical disapointment of the year.This cd is so bad it's not worth your money.I used to love them, I have all their cd's and have seen them in concert several times. I also love Beyonce's ""Dangerously in love"", which i think is a brillianr album.This cd is just plain BORING, so unispired and unoriginal it's not even funny.Unfortunatley it seems that it's all about making money now, and all the creativity seem to have gone.Sad!Save your money."
4,R U Serious...,"Everybody knows who the creator, writer, lead singer, and best singer of Destiny's Child was, Ms. Beyonce. Kelly, Latoya, and the other 2, didn't have what it took to lead this group. Listen to music and ask yourself, if you would even pay good hard earned money to go their concerts. Their has only been one who has made a semi billboard hit. Kelly... The others haven't done much to nothing. Instead of hatin', they should thank Beyonce for carrying them and making them millionaires in the process. Beyonce could and would have blown up with any other 2 or three girls. Believe me, Kelly, and the ""other one"", were the smartest ones. They shut up and were thankful for their high paying jobs. After Beyonce went solo, you know they went ""darn it, there goes the money."" They were right. The Kelly and ""other one"" want and need Beyonce back, not the other way around. Don't get it twisted again..."
3,Slow but not too painful,"A fairly solid album with mostly slow tracks. I bought the album because I loved the singles ""Lose My Breath"" and Soldier"". But, as big a fan as I am of Destiny's Child this album is relatively bland. As most of the album consists of slower songs its hard to pick any that really stand out but those that I like include: ""Cater 2 U"" and ""Free"". However, for the fans who liked their previous albums and like their voice and style then this may possibly satisfy you."
2,"Mediocre Album, but..","""Through With Love"" is a fantastic song. It's the reason I didn't give this album 1 star. The group would have probably been better off releasing this song as a CD single because it's the only one on the entire album that has substance. Download this song and you'll be set."
1,What was fulfilled? Because Destiny definitely was not..,"What is their to write? This CD holds nothing but disappointment. I'm not a huge fan, but usually they are able to carry a cd well. All of the songs on here are so dependent and slow. Don't buy it."
1,What The Eff?,"I haven't liked a Destiny's Child album since the Writings on the Wall, and I was like 16 then. What did I know about music? My roomate has this CD and it irritates the hell out of me everytime she plays it. What The F***! There is so much hype surrounding these ladies and I just don't get it. This album is just a bunch of rejects that did not make it onto Beyonce's album(which was trash by the way). All the media has to say is ""They're the next best thing"" and the entire world flocks to the artist, not matter how bad they are. Maybe I am out of the mainstream loop--but Where's EnVogue?"

3,Not bad but far from excellent,"Not sure if i'm sold on this. I got it as a gift and while I'm planning on wearing it, i wouldn't buy it for myself again. Its light spicy floral, pleasant enough but for some reason smells kind of cheap to me."
2,NOT CRAZY FOR THIS ONE!,Im not too crazy about this scent it is almost too sweet for me. I tried it on my wrist before I decided to buy and I decided not to buy! Just not for me.
3,Common sense,"As with many roles that of a photo assistant is to pay attention, anticipate and use good common sense when working with a photographer, The Photographer's Assistant offers a good primer on all elements of assisting at a basic entry-level."
2,Rehashed work,Seems like this book was a result of a Wikipedia entryand a bunch of Google searches.Most info WAY out of date.Needs update - in this century update !
3,Could've been a family film,"I loved this one for the simple fact that I love Robert Carlyle. It seems as though no matter what he plays in, the part always seems to fit him like a glove. While I enjoyed the concept of this movie: boy loves dog, dog wins as underdog, and everyone lives happily ever after. It just isn't so. Not to spoil the ending but the perfect ending never happens. I would've loved to have seen less severe profanity and outright violence. There's good lessons for children in the film but do to the nature of the script, it is definitely not kid friendly. Not to mention, the main child character smokes throughout. All in all, I liked it; I just wished I could share it with my family. It's a bit like a dysfunctional Lassie."
5,Zojirushi PA-FMC02 Replacement filter set use amazon.com to order is fast & easy.,"Before I try to call Zojirushi retail store & search all the near by location around spend a whole week, until my girl friend tell me, so I try to place an order from amazon.com, it is very easy, fast & save alot money, I really like amazon service, it is very helpful, no more headache & rush, I can easy to get what I need, so every time when I turn on my computer must click amazon.com to search any special first."
3,Good But...,"Interesting information, however, it's missing information from it's original televised version (i.e. the introduction of the elevator expressing how fast our culture is compared to the beginning of the 20th century)."
1,"I saw the author on CNN, some days ago","I'll be sincere.I didn't read this book.And I don't want to read it.About ten years ago, I tried to read another book, from the same author.The book was nothing more than a trash.Thinking there was possibility that the author had changed, I watched his interview on CNN some days ago.The interview was about this book.And the author if had changed anything, became even worse.Please, don't waste your time, money or perhaps even your mind, following the fool ideas from this trash-book."
2,thankful for opinions,"I have not read this book, but recently saw Pastor Hagee on television and was intrigued by his comments on Jewish persecution throughout history. I immediately came to Amazon.com to read reviews for his book because I knew I would get opinions on both sides. Thanks, Amazon.com, for giving people the opportunity to express their opinions. I have chosen not to spend time reading this book, since it definitely seems to be very ""controversial""."
1,"The book is garbage, period.","Forget even finishing it, the book is unreadable. It offends any sort of historian that might ask for sources to be cited, assertions proven, or a logical proposal offered. I won't even bother reviewing it against theology, where I am admittedly out of my depth and happily so if this is representative of what constitutes theological work. I managed to get through three chapters before I dismissed this book as garbage. It's a work of fiction, and it's bad fiction at that. Followers of this kind of thinking are the real fifth column threat to America.-C"
1,Shocked,"THE AUTHOR IS SPREADING A LIE THAT ALL JEWS ARE SAVED BECAUSETHEY ARE JEWS. THIS IS APOSTASY AND CONTRADICTS THE NEW TESTAMENT PRIMARY DOCTRINE OF SALVATION, ALL NT SCRIPTURES ONSALVATION AND THE WORDS OF JESUS CHRIST ON SALVATION."
5,Author gives numerous scripture references,"This is an easy to read book with numerous scripture references, many of them explaining why,as a Christian,I should support the State of Israel. As I read this book, I studied the references in my Bible. I gained a better understanding of the history of Israel and the Jewish people, as well as the Islamic fanatics and their command for violence. Pator Hagee helped me understand why I should not ignore the turmoil in the Middle East."
5,Very Revealing!,"If u want to know, the second coming of Yeshua Hamasia, You must buy this book for further reference. No book like it."
1,URGENT MESSAGE TO ALL BELIEVERS,"I sincerely hope that the author Mr. Hagee has not lost his mind in that he has totally thrown away all he has learned and preached all these years of God's word. He surely has lost it, teaching and preaching the falsehoods in this new book. I will have to appoligize to God Almighty for filling my heart and mind with such false trash. Salvation is for everyone and the new birth experience is a requirement to make heaven our home. To enter it any other way, is to be a theif and a robber, according to Bible. We can't rewrite it or change it to suit any group of people or ourselves. Shame on the author and anyone else who teaches this. I too, as stated by others, love and respect the Jewish people but Christ died for them as well and they will have to accept him and the cross. I can't fall for this new wind of doctrine, nor should any other person reading this new book."
3,Jerusalem Countdown,Extremely well writtenA lot of insight on World affairs that are presented under a different perspectiveAuthor however does not exercise caution when prophesizing about future eventsWorth reading however ...
1,I have deep concerns about the book: Jerusalem Countdown,"I love Israel and am thankful for all who are helping Israel, but I am very troubled by Pastor Hagee's interpretation and his belief that the Church and Christians are not to proclaim Christ to the Jews. I am neither a Pastor or theologian, but I believe what the Bible says in John ""I am the way the truth and the life, NO man comes to the Father but through me."" Those are not my words, or the words of some organization or denomination. Those are the words of Jesus himself! Jesus set the conditions! We ALL broke the law, and JESUS paid the fine. Not budda, not muhammad, not the Pope! I am believing in a risen Savior who paid the sins of the whole world! Pastor Hagee, please do not be the cause of sending a false message to people who trust you, and will believe your false doctrine. I would not want to be in your shoes on judgement day! Esther"
5,Jerusalem Countdown.,met my expectations. A great read for anyone interested in bible phrophacy. Pastor Hagee is an engaging writer! I recomend this book highly.
2,hyperbolic drivel...,facts? not in this book. insight? nope. this book seems like a collection of sermons and passages from other books..not much in the way of foresight or insight. Do we stand at the crossroads of trouble in the Middle East? well yeah..sure can find that out in a hundred different books which are more meaningful and fact filled.
4,Jerusalem Countdown,"Wat a book. Could not lay it down. A well documented work that gave me an overview of wat the Jews have gone through since their Exodus from Egypt. Also it gives me a glimps of what is ahead based on the profecies of the Bible. The God of Abraham, Isaäc and Jacob is the same Yesterday, today and forever."
5,Interesting!!,This is a good book for anyone wanting to learn about the state of our world!! Being we are so close to the end times this is a must read!!
5,It has come to pass what GOD has written in BIBLE,I reconmend this book to those who think that GOD willnot punish sin. Look around and you'll find out that GOD has a purpose for every body. that purpose is that He gave His begun son that who ever believes in JESUS NAME will be save and will have eternal life.
2,2 and 1/2 stars really...,this is the 1st hagee outline i've been able to read through. informative but dry in large parts. buy used.
1,A Complete Blunder,"If you enjoy reading the contuous cycle of books relating current events to things to come, than by all means by this blunder of a book. For instance if you were one of those who thought JFK was the anti-Christ because of the JFK assassination and head wound than by all means buy this book! Or if you later translated the anit-Christ headwound as the Gorbachev birth mark than please buy this book! Consider last years ""end-time"" hurricanes and the fact that hurricane season officially ended November 30 without a single hurricane in the United States and only five on this little blue planet called earth. During the true return of Christ, Hagee's work will be elimanted with the rest of the foolish propoganda he displays.If you'd like to read an excellent commentary on Revelation, I suggest Craig Koester's ""Revelation and the End of All Things.""Don't waste your time on work that by no means contains scholarship such as Jerusalem Countdown."
3,Jerusalem Countdown,"John Hagee does not always follow the bible, but interprets it to suit his own motivations."
1,"Yea, I don't know bout this one","I typically don't write reviews, due to the fact of, books are meant to be read without personal bias going into it, but rather letting the author make his/her case. Regardless if you agree with Hagee or not, the question MUST be asked...who in the HELL uses wikipedia as its primary source for information...Oh, that's right, John Hagee. If you turn to page 245 and read through 256 you will find most of his resources are secondary in nature and not primary. He cites wikipedia some 7 times on page 246. If I could give a no star I would. I have the 2007, ""Revised and Updated"" version. As a reader I was greatly offended and disgusted that I spent money on something that is most likely fabricated in nature. FIRST rule of research is FIND the PRIMARY source JOHN!!!!If you still want to read it just go to wikipedia. I'm sure you will eventually stumble across some of what Hagee did too."
2,I just don't understand such Ignorance...,"How is it Hagee in the 80's was saying this exact same stuff about the USSR? They were the Beast, Gorbachov was the anti-christ, they would attack israel with nukes, etc.... Pretty amazing. Oh Well, it makes him rich, and his readers have short memories.Glad I didn't buy the Book, borrowed my Moms copy."
1,Late(r) Great Planet Earth,"These types of writings seem to actually follow in the tradition of prophetic writings. Moreover, they proliferate in times of trouble. People are trying to use some guide to make sense of their situations and their lives. How to understand all of this. Might one recommend instead the excellent book, Misquoting Jesus, authored by a reputed biblical scholar, Bart Ehrman.That the Middle East is a troubled region is nothing new. Much of the material covered in Pastor Hagee's book was covered in Hal Lindsey's work from the 1970s, during the Arab oil embargo. While true believers have been beating the apocalyptic drum for well over 2 thousand years, it can be a distraction from the very real problems we face. Might we not do better to focus on the here and now, in learning how to live together in kindness toward each other?"
1,Not The Da Vinci Code,"I have not read this book and probably never will. It is clear enough from the well-reported historical and factual inaccuracies and unsupported conclusions that the book is fiction.Since it is fiction, but is clearly not intended to be entertaining or edifying, it fails as a book. A similar book, clearly labeled as fiction and written for the express purpose of entertainment, is The Da Vinci Code. That book presents a more rewarding experience -- simply because Dan Brown never requires the reader to suspend both disbelief AND the faculty of reason. Nor does he claim for himself or his book some sort of divine guidance to justify the suspension of both disbelief and reason."
2,A Little Disappointing,"I must admit, I am a little disappointed with this book. I watch John Hagee weekly and his sermons are so dynamic about the ends times that I thought this book would transcend that same information.But this book mainly goes on about the Jewish people and how we should support them. I do not disagree with him, but wished the book had covered more than just this point. He does speak of Iran and the nuclear arsenal they are building, but that is at the first of the book and it gets repetitive.I'll still watch him on TV and hope that he releases a DVD pack of these sermons on the Jerusalem Countdown to Crisis."
1,Horrible,"I purchased this to replace a similar Ace comb that broke in 1/2 after many years of faithful service. This comb looks the same, but is NOT the same. The tips of each tine are like little razors to my scalp. I'm scratching myself with each pull of it through my hair. Seems to be a problem with combs these days - they don't finish them properly. They used to have nice finished rounded smooth ends on the tines, now they just plain HURT! Waste of my money. I will never use this comb again."
1,ACE comb-disappointed,"I always buy ACE combs because their tines are usually smooth/rounded so the comb doesn't scratch your head the way cheap combs usually do. Unfortunately the ACE comb I received has sharp tines, I will not bother to use it. I have a black ACE comb I recently purchased from a grocery store that is of the quality I would expect; so I know good ACE combs still exist. I only ordered this one because I liked the color. I am very disappointed in the quality of this comb. In addition, the cost of shipping was more than the cost of the comb...if I had realized that before placing my order, I would have cancelled this item (this was one item in a two hundred dollar order).On a positive note, the seller was very quick in sending the comb. I received it within 3 days of placing the order."
2,Not a quality comb,"I bought this comb to replace my excellent, decades-old Ace comb that had gotten broken but I was really disappointed with its quality. It is a poorly made knockoff of the old Ace combs and has very sharp teeth that scratch my scalp. When I find a better comb this one is going into the trash."
2,Ace,Normally Ace makes excellent hair products. This particular comb was not of the best quality. It was not the strong sturdy quality I had grown acustom to. Very rubbery. Just not the best quality at ALL.
4,"Delightful and Thought Provoking, with a Kernel of Hokey","A jolly red thread runs across most pages of this STUNNING book, tying together themes that are found both in nature and computing. These connections are the spurious part; many of the interrelations are highlighted by similar looking pictures of phenomena in computing and nature.Yet, it is visually captivating and contains thoughtful facts about the wonders of nature and the history of computing.The ideal reader for this book will have a sense of humor; the comparisons are delightful. This book is a romp. I wish I'd had it in high school; it is a wonderful thought-provoker for inquisitive people who don't take everything at face value.Some things have a kernel of truth; this book has a kernel of hokiness, used as a device to keep the narrative flowing and lively."
1,Way too long to get Mag,"Ordered Nov. 14 & have still not recieved my first isse-1 1/2 months ,are you kidding me. I could see 3 weeks maybe."
3,Still waiting,I haven't received my first issue yet but I saw a copy and it'll do.I just wish they had daytime listings
2,Not What I though it was.,"Though it was a full T.V. guide, not Prime Time only. What if you want to know whats on at one in the afternoon or six P.M.? Could not care less what the stars are doing. Just want know whats on T.V. ALL the time."
1,TV Guide,"This publication only gives the TV schedule for prime time only, four hours.Certainly does not include many channels."
1,This magazine is a terrible joke!,"I would never have bought this if I had seen it ahead of time.It only shows listings for 3 hrs (in evening), yet it has pageafter page of other material I'm not interested in.It also seem hard to read the listings."
1,very disappointed,"I am not happy with the tv guide. There are no daytime entries......the time the programs are listed are from 8 pm.........the station channel #'s are not listed anywhere example CBS channel 2...... I have to use my daily newspaper to see what and when to see any programs.....I also refer to my tv channel selections which show only the next 3 hours or so. If I could get my money refunded, I would be very happy, because I find the tv guide useless."
2,T.V.Guide,"This is not the t v guide I remember.This is a magizine that only gives times of tv shows from 8pm to 11pm,Not what I thought I was geting at all.I was looking for an all day tv guide"
1,Subscription price is ridiculous,"This isn't a comment on the product, just the price. I paid $14 for 56 issues at the TV Guide website."
2,TV Guide + Kindle,"The TV guide is fine,but what does +Kindle mean? I thought I would be able to use my Kindle to see theTV guide. How does that work?"
3,subscription not exteneded,I was already a subscriber and my subscription should have been extended. Instead I received two copies each time. After Amazon contacted them they say it will be corrected in February. I hope so. virginia
3,Reflections,Paid too much for Guide. Others have lower prices for the same subscription. Should have does additional shopping. Guide is as advertised.
4,Nice Gift,"I gave this subscription to my Mother and Father-in-law, but they wish it had the schedule for daytime TV. They are both retired and are at home durign the day and want this included in the book."
2,Amazon ad misleading,"Upset with Amazon for not clarifying that the Kindle version is only available with Kindle fire, not Kindle touch or the other more basic Kindles. Can't really say the mag is okay yet, after three weeks have not received any copies. Not sure why it should take 4-6 weeks to receive the first copy."
2,NOT YOUR MOTHER'S TV GUIDE,"We got this subscription for Granny, who was initially delighted....until she realized that it only includes prime time tv listings. As she watches tv mostly daytimes, this is a dealbreaker."
4,Tv guide magazine,This item is a great magazine. I would recommend this magazine to anyone. Is highly recommended to people to love to read.
3,More magazine than TV Guide,"The articles are enjoyable but there is very little relation to local TV programming. TV Guide at one time was specific to local areas, but now has nothing on local stations, programming, etc. I'm disappointed! Maybe Amazon could suggest changes to TV Guide?"
4,TV Guide useful,Have discovered TV Guide again after a number of years. It offers just enough information to make decisions as to what to watch. Only wish they offered Saturday and Sunday afternoon info. They do waste a lot of pages at the front of the magazine giving superfluous information of lilttle interest to me.
4,TV Guide renewal Subscription,"My renewal went up by $5.00. Then I found it for $5.00 less in a few places after I placed my renewal order. I tried to cancel my order IMMEDIATELY, but was told I could not."
2,TV GUIDE: Bring back ALL DAY LISTINGS,"I am really disapointed that TV Guide only has Prime Times listed. I was expecting ALL DAY and ALL NIGHT listings so I could glance through to see what I wanted to record - especially movies. I have come across really good movies running at 2:00am or 1:00 in the afternoon. I don't have time to sit in front of my TV to go thru the next week's schedule for all the channels. Is there any magazine left out there that has 24/7 listings? DirecTV used to, and it was great. They even had a section that was all the movies for the month listed alphabetically with the times they played. But they stopped making that magazine."
1,It has not extended my subscription yet.,How long does it take to update my subscription? This is taking a very long time to update my subscription.
2,TV Guide,"I will not renew again.Chanel listings are not in order,2-4-5-7-9-and so on.Also it begins at 8:00 pm prime time.I would like to see it like before.To see daytime listings.I am retired and watch tv before prime tme.Other than that the articles are very good.But let's get the TV Guide like it was in the good old days."
1,extremely disapointed,"Unlike the past, current TV guide issues are worthless at any price and insulting as a gift for anyone. The guide does not give complete daily (twenty four hour)TV listings as I remember it. Whoever produces it has severely damaged it's reputation."
2,Missing information,"The TV Guide subscription looked like a good deal. When the first copy arrived, I learned that there was no edition for my time zone. (They have none for either Mountain or Pacific time.) This made the book virtually worthless, since I coldn't tell for sure when various shows were on...especially on the non-network channels."
3,Missing day time listings,"Wish it had day time listing also, especially for the weekends. Have to add nine more words, so here they are."
1,lost issues,My credit card was billed 3 months prior to the end of the orginal subscription. I canceled the renewal but my orginal subscription was also canceled without my knowledge. Upon calling several numbers I finally got somebody that understood what had happened and issued credit for what I lost.
5,great value,great value for the money and you can go back and have it not be on auto renewel if you want to
3,Not very dependable,"The main reason I wanted TV Guide was to get advance notice as to when TV shows would be coming on. TV Guide is not very accurate on this especially on their ""double"" issues."
1,taking its time to start,"I did not start getting it yet, taking a long time, hope I start getting it soon, looking for it to start"
3,I wanted daytime listings also,"I did not like the TV Guide because all the listings start at 8PM, or did I miss something here. What about the daytime listings."
4,Info Source,"I utilize the TV Guide as a info source and and entertainment assistant. I have found it to be extremely informative & accurate. I check the magazine for ""new information"" and listings."
4,A useful tool for TV watching,"I wanted a magazine which would tell me specifically which TV programs were on every channel for a whole week (or two, in this case), so I could plan my watching and/or recordings. TV Guide does that for me, quite satisfactorily."
1,VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!,"I really have to say that I would NEVER have subscribed to this if I'd been able to preview it. Not only does it NOT have the daytime schedule, it has far too many pages of ""nothing"". Total waste of money, as far as I'm concerned. I wouldn't even give it 1 star!!I would Love to have a refund!!!"
4,Great Magazine For Avid TV Watchers,"While some people don't like to admit that they watch a lot of TV, I'll gladly admit that I watch it, and enjoy it. Therefore, this magazine provides more in-depth information about many of the shows I watch. They let me know what shows are doing well, and what shows are on the chopping block. Also, I like the in-depth articles they do about a particular show each week.The one disappointment I have is that I thought I would be able to receive this electronically on my tablet that has a Kindle app. Apparently, one has to have an actual Kindle in order to have this feature, so I do wish Amazon would expand the electronic version to all tablets with Kindle apps. I docked it one star because of this."
5,reader,"Was a great buy, and made the day for my wife, who has been requesting this magazine for a while."
1,I have yet to receive this product,I ordered the tv guide on October 10th. It is November 20th and I have yet to receive the product.
1,Cancelation,Want to cancel this order within 3 hours of placing it.Told I CAN NOT cancel.WHY NOT?????
1,A waste of money.,This is not your mother's TV Guide. No daytime or early evening listings. No channel 12. Many listings are wrong. A total waste of money. Will not renew. Better to look up programming on the internet. At least it's usually accurate.
2,Poor customer service.,"I have not received a single issue to date, I plan to cancel it. I thought the price was qutie a bargain but like so many things if the price is too good, well then it is not real."
3,Prime Time Listings Only,"This ""TV Guide"" magazine only lists the shows, Monday through Sunday, starting in Prime Time (8:00PM - 11:30PM) and also includes sections covering TV related news, editorials, reviews of upcoming shows, sports highlights, and a weekly horoscope. We subscribed to this so my mother could keep track of the shows she likes to watch in the evenings and I was pleasantly surprised that it included version for the Kindle Fire along with the physical edition.The physical magazine is printed on decent enough stock to last the viewing week. The Kindle edition is actually nicely formatted and easy to navigate. Both editions include advertising.This could be right for you, if you only need Prime Time listings or are interested in the other content.CFH"
2,TV Guide for Kindle,"The price was good for a years subscription of TV Guide and I could also get it on my Kindle,what could be better? WRONG,the font is so small it cannot be read and the size button for your font is disabled on your device for this app.Have to rely on the hardcopy for this"
3,"It's OK - good for the reviews, etc.",I was disappointed that the time frame for shows were off for my area (Phx. AZ.)Plus there were some channels not listed I had hoped were. I think for most people in mostplaces it's OK. Good for show & movie info.
2,Not What I though it was,Not what I though it was. Can't get with my Kindle app on Touchpad. Wanted 24 hour listings. Doesn't cover all channels.
4,Handy to have the print issue,"I'm a TV nerd, I admit it and I don't want to miss anything so getting the print issue of TV Guide works great for me. I appreciate the ""highlights"" listed for each evenings primetime viewing and I like the grid format A LOT. At a glance I am able to see whats new for the evening so I can program my DVR quickly and get it done with. On occasion I have used the Kindle edition and found it fun too, but I much prefer the print. (Same with my books though, so take that for what it's worth, ha ha). Also as an aside I enjoy the ""thumbs up/thumbs down"" TV review on the back page each week too!"
3,Corelle dinnerware,I ordered a small 10 oz desert bowl in Corelle Enhancement pattern. I thought I was getting 4 bowls but later learned there were four available but I was sent one. $9.00 was about $4.00 too much for this one bowl. My mistake.
1,"Amazing rip off, but really easy to return",I ordered this bowl because I assumed that for 32.42 there was more than one bowl in the package. This is a 10 ounce bowl about 3 inches around. I couldn't believe that when I got the package it was one bowl. I returned it (which WAS very convenient and easy) and found the same bowl at another vendor for 34.00 for 8 (that's EIGHT) of them. Someone should look into the price of this item as I can't believe that it is correct!!!
5,Well worth the time,I love O'REILLYThere are aspects of his personality that I do not like but Bill is a voice in the wilderness of cable news today. He yells and screams as much as the next guy but he actually does research to back his ranting points up. This separates him from everyone else cable news (and radio) weather those people are liberal or conservative. I honestly don't know what side of the aisle Bill sits on.Overall-I think reading this book is worth your time.
2,Beyond Ego,"If you can get by all the ""great and marvels"" things this man says he does; if you can get by all the constant EGO; then you will have about 3 pages of good political wisdom."
4,Great video for learning kicks and turns.,"This video was great for learning the cool kicks and turns that can be used in swing and lindy timing. The instuctors were thorough and easy to follow. The video was evenly paced, not too slow like most videos."
4,Another Winner from Big City Swing,The only draw back with this video is that it did not delve into some of the moves unique to 8-count swing and the Charleston foot work. But Chris and Julie do an excellent job of teaching the swing out in a way that anyone can learn from it. They also do a good job of adding in 6-count swing to help students adjust to mixing 6 and 8 counts. I would make sure that you have either a sound back ground in 6-count swing or view the previous two videos in the series (Beginning/Intermediate 6-count Swing).
4,Wooden Nickel Factor,"Let me start off by saying that I am an avid fan of the Justus League since the listening from Little Brother. So much so that I recomend the group to anyone who is not a fan or who is just realizing what real Hip Hop is all about. This album is exactly what I expected it to be. The songs that really stick out in my mind from this LP are Up & Down, Big Game Hunters w/Phonte, Downpour w/Ill Son a.k.a. Stage Presence and, Rock like us w/Sean Boog. In this album, producer L in Japaneese(hope I spelled that right) and M.C. Ill son really stand out. L being the producer delivers a nice beat to mesh with the flow of Ill son, the guest mc on Downpour and commanche himself in who also delivers great lines. Over all, Dope beats dope rhymes hip hop is not complicated. The only reason why I gave it 4 stars is because for some reason I dont really feel as if this tops Paper Gods in which personaly I think is great classic material but..... thats another review."
5,Don't hesitate.Buy it asap.,"I'm Going to make this short and sweet.I think this the best record to come out in 2005. It's 2008 and I still listen to this religiously. Tasteful songs like ""Miss you"" make this nice for mature hip hop lovers."
3,Tim is a freak!,"This is 'Like a Tim's fourth full length album released on the great Rephlex label. This 19-track (75min) album stuffed with freaky - but interesting - electronica! Along the lines of Bogdan Raczynski (highly recommended) 'Like A Tim' makes music that makes you laugh... He simply uses sounds and sound patterns that are funny. It's music that some weird alien acoustics scientist (?) might have crafted. Some of the tracks tend to be a bit annoying, though, and it's too 'soft' for my taste - meaning that it's so slow that I don't feel like dancing at all. Still it's hilarious."
5,Better than expected,"This is a surprisingly solid piece of furniture that looks really good. I wish there were more color options, as I really wanted an espresso finish, but the dark brown look is just fine. The Shelf on the bottom is very sturdy and there is no wobble at all in this furniture. As a bonus, it came packed like a tank. Took a while to get out of the box (it was double boxed with spray in foam around it), but that helped protect it really well during shipping. COnsidering I looked at higher priced items and this was as good or better quality than all of them, I could highly recommend this."
3,Cleo lite,"Ludwig was a popular biographer of some decades ago. The scholar need not bother with his works. Cleopatra's breasts are mentioned on the first page. This is typical of the level on which Ludwig deals with his subject. This is, in a way, an historical novel. Ludwig invents things, as for example, he says that all four of the children of Cleopatra's father were clever and bright. There is no proof of this, this is just off the top of Ludwig's head. It sounds interesting, so he puts it in. And so forth."
4,Love the Name,"I love the name of this book but maybe because I'm partial...given I can't find a book mark, key chain, etc with my name on it yet, I can find this book. If you haven't guessed it by now, my name is Alena. This was given to me as a gift from a friend of mine who found it at a yard sale and knew I'd love it. I was 18 at the time. This book is what gave me the idea that I just might like reading romances. So I trudged through the book to find out that I do in fact love romances and am honored to share the name and a lot of characteristics of this heroine.Great book! and even Greater Name!"
2,LA Deco form A to Z,"As a current member of 3 Art Deco Socities (NY, LA and Chicago)and owner of at least 30 books on Art Deco, this book told me nothing new or enlightning. I am not in any way a Deco authority, but it would be nice to read (and see) something new about LA. Most photos are a rehash of already printed material and many need additional shots to explain the architecture. For example: the Wiltern Theatre. The interior is 1000% more fantastic than the one exterior photo used. The Wiltern is one of the best examples of theatre deco ever designed.But, for those that have never set foot in LA, this book may suffice their deco urge."
5,American Beauty,"At the time I first read this book I was living in Africa, fairly disinteresteed in the boomer generation, and this was the book that turned it around. In many ways it was my first introduction to the decade, the way it was experienced here in the US, and also to the modern American psyche. Although it is a brilliant comment on the politics and mores of the time, the driving force throughout is the accurate, human, living characters that inhabit and inspire the novel. On top of the sometimes bleak, sometimes ecstatic narative thread, is the most poignant, wonderful love afair. Honest, not a word of schmaltz. I am perhaps biased by over 10 yrs of fond absence from this fantastic book, and I must confess that I'm more interested in finding a back copy than giving a constructive, objective review."
4,A great review of growing up in the 60's and 70's.,"First of all I must point out that I read this book more than 15 years ago. It was a book that was passed around to so many people that the last time I saw my copy it had rubber bands holding it together. More important was the fact that people of all ages and backgrounds read it and took their own special meaning from the lives portrayed. This is probably the single best fictional historic account of a person coming of age in the 60's and 70's ever found. The characters were all reasoned and presented the joys and frustrations of an era that saw some of the best and worst times of the modern era. If anyone wants to understand where baby-boomers came from, and how they lost their souls, this is the book."
2,Why the 5-star reviews?,"I really don't understand the wildly positive reviews for this product unless they are company plants. The audio quality is poor and there are no pauses to be able to repeat. The manual is also poor quality and full of stuff that seems to have no relation to what is happening on the tapes. Finding the matching section in the manual involves paging through numerous pages until you happen to stumble on the part you are looking for. No logical layout to any of it. If you have lots of patience and extra time to waste you could probably get some benefit from these, but there are much better products out there. I was thinking of trying the regular Learning Spanish Like Crazy Courses but now I'm reconsidering after seeing this mess."
1,Disappointed,"I sent this product back because it arrived very damaged. The CD encasements were broken and most of the CDs were scratched. The CDs looked like burned copies of the program with an FSI Programmatic Spanish label stuck on top. The PDF ""textbook"" was hard to follow along with the CDS and overall is an inconvenient replacement for a hard copy of the actual textbook. I also felt that it was overpriced, as I believe level 1 & 2 of the same program is actually available online because it's quite old. I cannot say that the program isn't effective being as I returned it, however I would recommend checking it out online at this website- http://fsi-language-courses.com/Spanish.aspx first to see if it's what you're looking for and to try to get a copy of the actual textbook."
2,Dated material and bad media,"While the educative quality is good, it's totally ruined by the failure to update either the material and, particularly, failure to use decent media quality. The digital/print material is a bad copy job, the digital/audio material is sadly dated and poorly constructed, and the many of the discs don't function because of poor quality control.I'd look elsewhere for material and not waste my money here. The frustration is simply not worth it."
4,Yeah ... it's irreverent!,"Yeah ... it's irreverent!Some might even go so far as to say it's disgustingly lewd. I'm sure there are some who would rocket from the planet Earth or stick their heads in a bucket of wet concrete to avoid listening to this album, and good for them. Their sense of propriety and good taste are to be highly commended, and rightly so! This is as raunchy a gristle thumping, in your face, ear-drum pounding, wanton wad of brain bashing promiscuity as you'll ever hear. I love it!!!Not for the faint of heart, though."
5,The Absolute Downward trip to Hell,"This is sex and music combined to their best. Play this thing if you're about to have sex. It's not the NiN's ""Closer"" or Pulp's ""This is Hardcore"" kind of sex music, it's hellish. You're going to x-perience a trippy sexual intercourse. I specially like Voodo-U. Dirty Willy, Drink My Honey, and The Real Thing, which was featured in the movie Strange Days. Try to get this cover, not the other on, 'cause it really lives up to the level of the music in the CD. This CD will make you LUST."
2,not my favorite LOA cd,"I really do not like this album. I realize they updated their sound from the Lust album with its early big beat, acid house grooves: but the vocal on this album are way too screechy for my taste. This is not what I would call dance music, I sold this one back. I love the Expand You Head album and it has several of the Voodoo-U songs remixed and fixed."
2,A really horrible entry from an awesome group,"I am a huge LOA fan, but I don't know what was up with this album. Maybe they were trying to expand their horizons. There isn't a single track worth dancing to (Lust had many,and Our Little Secret had a few). Half of the album sounds inappropriately ecclectic. Jade adopts and accent somewhere between Counseler Troy from Star Trek and Bjork. The obscenity the band is known for seems forced and gratutious, and not the least bit rebellious. If you want to hear the group at its best, go with Lust, Our Little Secret, or Heaven is an Orgasm."
2,Good story; bad format & presentation,"Although this depicts DD's first showdown with the Punisher- the first of many classic clashes between these two- and was my first exposure to Frank Miller's comic writing & illustrating abilities, this collection is (literally) flawed. Every single copy of this TPB I've ever looked at has a few pages that are out of sequence. There's also a missing moment that was likely removed because the backstory involved was not included in this collection.Fortunately, all the issues reprinted in ""Child's Play"" have also been reprinted in the new ""Daredevil Visionaries: Frank Miller"" trade paperbacks. The color's better, the pages are in order, the missing panels are restored, and the backstory that caused the omission of these panels- AKA the ""Death of Elektra"" issue- is also included. Pick those up instead.`Late!"
2,"Plodding, patronizing and ultimately empty work","Robert Oxnam is a member of the Asia Society ""think tank"", the Council on Foreign Relations, and high level advisor to government and business elites who shape ""multilateralist"" China policy. Not surprisingly, this work of fiction papers over a pivotal period of Chinese history that remains a flashpoint for Chinese people (who know that the history was otherwise), with a globalist revision in which (for example) brutal Manchu conquerors were instantly benevolent and wise(they were not), turncoats are heroes (""peace and stability"" are preferred to liberty and revolution), Jesuit missionaries are ethical (they were not), and Confucianism (his version of it) conquers all. While Oxnam does a decent job with period details, he thoroughly fails to grasp the psyche of real Chinese people. This is a trip in the curio shop, from a western perspective, and it has an agenda."
1,Dissappinting,Not very useful limited customizing. Difficult to use. directions not clear for use. Consider something else. Not a good item for price.
3,A bit smaller than I thought,"The detail is okay, the charms are a lot smaller than I anticipated. I ordered this to wear in my scottish wedding, and I will still wear it. It is pretty, just quite a bit smaller than I thought it was going to be."
5,Quick and Easy,"This book saved me from having to spend a fortune on a period costume for the re-enactment party. With some dye, glue, pins, and the ideas gleaned from it, I came up with my own Renaissance gown. And, it was so easy. You would not believe the people who asked where I got my costume. There is no doubt in my mind, when other occasions arise, I will be able to show up in a unique costume I have designed myself. I would recommend this book to anyone, especially people who don't sew, in need of a costume for any occasion."
4,Jack of all trades,"I bought this book awhile ago, and I found that it came in really handy for my high school drama class. This book has great suggestions about how to create costumes when you're on a very limited budget; the hardest part of making any of these costumes is to avoid burning your fingers with the glue gun! I would especially reccommend it to anyone who is a high school drama teacher (like me) who has a program with no money and big expectations. :)"
5,Sublime Part,"This is textural music, subtle and sublime. Everytime I listen to it, I hear more and go deeper. Highly recommended by this musicologist."
4,Think Twice about this particular purchase .....,"Arbos and Tabula Rasa are much better introductions to Part's music than this sampler because of the mix of Chamber, Orchestra, Choral and soloing on those other releases. This is obviously an opinion, but I think that several of these versions of compositions, especially Britten and Summa, are performed much better on their original albums or other compilations. I only write this review as someone who just purchsed a large quantity of Part's releases and has been comparing them ... so I think I am trying to target buyers who might be looking to dip their toes into the work of this amazing composer. I really have been captivated by Part and I can't believe that I'm just now coming around to this modern composer who is not mentioned enough (I hear a little too much about Glass and Reich and Adams)"
5,NOT OF THIS WORLD,"Tabula Rasa: Silentium : This music is not of this world. I worship/pray in silence while driving with this music on with a palm facing the windshield. The haunting, surreal background...the two main violins mournfully cries out aloud...yet so beautiful...my heart cries with them."
5,excellent,I have used 2 other brands and they always seem to loosen a bit after a few miles. This strap has an over-center feature that tightens the strap when you close the buckle and then the Velcro wraps around to lock it in place and also hold any extra strap from flying around. Another feature is the hooks have a wire retainer that keeps them in place when tying down. I wish everthing worked this well.
2,A good remedy for insomnia,"My toddler with Autism is a visual learner and loves videos but this one could not hold her attention more than a few minutes. It is slow and quiet, resembling a lecture. It lacks any quality of fun and is devoid of any music or cartoon characters. There is nothing in this video that I couldn't have done myself with my camcorder, and my computer."
5,fire eyes Tee shirt Dragon,"This shirt was a Christmas gift for our grandson, he is into dargons and especially loves the fire Dragons. It is well made and as usual amazon got it here on time."
5,cute shirt,Cute shirt but I wish it was available in a smaller size. Medium was the smallest available when I ordered it.
5,Best Quality,"I bought this shirt ten years ago. It still looks brand new. The fabric is super soft and a good weight. The image is just as vibrant as day one. Read the size guide. I bought it too big, so it's been delegated to pyjamas."
5,A great chess book,"One of the things that make for a great biographical chess book is the honesty that author imbues in his life narrative. Although there have been a number of outstanding chess books of this type, Tal's book did break ground in the quality of his views.Outside of the great honesty and candor in the text is some great notes that help put you into the shoes of the late great Tal.Like the other reviewer, I have to report that the diagrams leave much to be desired."
5,A Truly Great Book,"This book is pervaded with a literary and anecdotal air that is rarely found in Chess literature (and, as I see it, is much needed). One gets the sense that he is reading the work of a man who deeply loved life and who took great pleasure in those little disjoint stories of which it is comprised whether or not they occured at the board. This book reads like a true biography with brilliantly annotated games acting as much welcomed photographs. Upon seeing the position from Tal's 1959 Interzonal game against Fischer, anyone interested in Tal will be captivated to hear Tal speak of how he tricked Fischer into losing a won position. The games and stories presented in this volume compliment each other masterfully. Quite simply, this is one of the greatest chess books ever written: In it one finds both great chess and great comedy. One must conclude that Tal was not only a master of chess but also of the pen!"
5,A true classic.,"I bought ""The Life and games of Mikhail Tal"" on the advice of many chess authors who have mentioned it in their works. I felt that if many Grandmasters rate it as the best chess book ever written, I probably wouldn't be dissapointed. I wasn't. The book is at once a superb peice of annotations and an insightful look into the life of one of the most beloved figures in chess history. It is a rare treat to be transported so vividly into the situations during some of the most famous games of modern chess, from the viewpoint of one of the players. Enjoy!"
1,Don't Buy This Book,"Mikhail Tal's game collection is one of the best books ever written by a world champion, but I cannot recommend this edition and here's why: Cadogan Books always fall apart! Regardless of the size of the book, I cannot get through a Cadogan book without half the pages falling out. The pages started falling out before page 80 of this 496-page book. Tal is probably the best writer of all the world champions, but do you really want to pay twenty-five bucks or so for a book that falls apart while you're reading it and has little or no resale value? Despite all that, if you don't mind reading your books in pieces, by all means buy this book. For you, I give this book 5 stars. Cadogan has several other great chess books and will surely publish more great ones in the future; but I won't be qualified to review them, because I will NEVER buy another Cadogan book again."
1,Wrong Book Edition,"I ordered the book of ""Anne's House of Dreams"" expecting it to be the Bantam Edition depicted in its advertisement. However, I received a different edition of the book. I was promised the edition I was looking at (Bantam Edition-pink book with just Anne on the cover) and was disappointed to see that it was a different edition."
4,"I really liked it, great story!!","I liked the book< it was entertaining. I did like it but at some points I was bored, so that's why it's only a 4 star rating"
3,Slog on to Get to the Real Anne,"Some of the wit and magic is missing from Anne's life in the beginning of this book. She's grown up, and there seems to be no real hurdles to cross, or conflict. It makes for a slow read for the first third of the book, while you wait for something to actually happen, instead of a completely idyllic life. Thankfully, things pick up by the 2nd third, and the reader is rewarded by the Anne we all know and care for- responding with love and romance to life's situations and participating in the redemption of those around her. Certainly the ending is a O'Henry twist you wouldn't ever expect. Here again is Anne that you have to sigh over in delight, and kick your feet in the air and laugh in the exhilaration of love found again."
4,Enjoyable reading,"Anne's House of Dreams is a very enjoyable book to read. LM Montgommery's writing style is so easy to follow. I read the other ""Anne"" books in sequence and felt I couldn't stop reading them until I got to the end. I just wanted to know how Anne's life and family progressed. The book is written in a simple style, easy for young readers to understand too."
3,Anne's House Of Dreams,"I am a big fan of the Anne series, but I felt that this book seemed different from the other ones. It was as if the characters weren't as painstakingly real as they seemed in the rest of the series. I would still reccommend this book if you are a fan of LM Montgomery, but not if you are just slightly interested in the books. There are new characters introduced, and the book chronicals the first few years of newly-weds, Anne and Gilbert Blythe. Their first house, first child, and first tragedy are all in this book, and I would say, Read it, but don't buy it."
2,BOO!,"I was super excited to read this book, knowing that Anne and Gilbert would finally be married in it.Little did I know that Anne would become totally boring once she got married, that L.M. would completely lose the magic that is anything about Anne, and that the folks in Avonlea would get maybe five brief mentions each in the book. (I exaggerate, but only slightly.)This entire book was about the other characters in their new location. Anne and Gilbert may as well have been minor incidental characters. It'd be like if Jane Austen had done a follow-up to Pride and Prejudice and then took Elizabeth and Darcy almost completely out of it, when THOSE TWO are the ones you want to read about.Extremely disappointing."
5,My favorite ANNE book!!!!!!!,"I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THIS BOOK! This is my favorite Anne book, hands and hooves down. I liked hearing about Anne's full transition into womanhood and the fact that she never really let her full spirit be crushed. Gilbert was a little too soppy in this story, but it is okay. And I really, really enjoyed the wedding scene. And the whole Leslie Moore story is so exciting, but sad...until she meets the sexy (by 1900's terms :-p )Owen Ford! And Captain Jim is something else...he is such an enjoyable, lovable character and the story of lost Margaret is slightly cliched (perfect love swept away, man vows never to love anyone else), but WONDERFUL."
4,"Anne - with Gilbert, babies and tragic friends","This book is like a rich tapestry. It has the added bloom of maturity that does not invade any other Anne books except perhaps Rilla of Ingleside. In this book we see Anne dealing with the first tragedy that happened since the start of her charmed life at Green Gables. Also there is Anne's enigmatic friend Leslie Moore, whose dark past makes this friendship more complicated than any other Anne has had to deal with.A gorgoeus book, but I miss Marilla and all the ""Avonlea folk""."
2,"what happened!?! this is not ghost recon, is it?","BLAH!! what happened to the old school versions of GHOST RECON. I bought this game first day it came out, so excited to play it. I played the very first stage, and never played it since then, It is very off topic. i dont like this game at all. I thought this game was going to turn out like every other great ghost recon made.negative features-there are only 2 squade members, not 5both members have same weapons, not their own unique.game play has very compicating controls and commandsthere are few health packs.squade member dies to easilyu have to constantly command your memberfinally-its first person mode so u cant see alot of your surroudings.posotives-I like the fact that its online.great graphics, sound and gameplay---- thats about itin this case, change is not good."
2,Truly Pathetic Ubisoft,"Well anyone who thought that the current gen versian of GRAW could match up with the 360 versian is disheartened. GRAW for the x-box is the worst game i've played this year. Unimpressive graphics, crap for controls and gameplay and it's laggy in single player! I am shocked that this game was made by ubisoft. There simply is no redeeming factors for this game it's just simply awful and UBISOFT should be ashamed of themselves for screwing over current gen owners with this craptacular game and what's even worse they had the nerve to sell it for 50$, that's just low. Easily the worst entry to GR series it's one you should avoid. The only GR game that could be worse than this is PS2 versian."
1,just no,"no. for the 360, this game is a brilliant masterpiece, but for xbox, just no. not gonna happen. shouldnt happen. i have it for xbox and 360 and i love it on 360 but on xbox i regret ever buying it. bad gameplay, bad graphics, and TYPOS to name just a FEW, no, LESS than a few problems with the xbox version of this game. just to many problems. JUST NO."
2,All Hype,"After waiting what seemed like an eternity for this game to come out, I can only say it was an utter disapointment. I have truly enjoyed every Ghost Recon up until this one. With hopes of good online gameplay, my friends and I purchased this game only to find out the online gameplay is tedious to initiate and full of bugs to play. Limited number of players is definitely a huge negative for this game for the online play!!Even in the single player campaign mode, the Xbox tends to bog down when the action starts to get intense.Expectations were high for this game, especially with all the advertising that was done. However, I found it was more hype than performance.It is still worth playing, but not worth the pricetag."
1,DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!,"this game is garbage for the original xbox - do not waste your money - trust me...I have ghost recon1, 2 & summit strike and this is a disgrace to have put out such junk and to think the studio that did splinter cell pandora tomorrow did this!! even a bigger disapointment...you have been warned."
4,This world is only going to break your heart,"I picked up the finality of all songs to coerce my shattered existence into believing that I was not alone. Something stirs upon the surface of ""Wicked game."" I can feel it now, as broken wings mend the indescribable feeling that there is nothing left. Is this world only going to break your heart? Yes. Upon the factors of condition which make us fall apart. She doesn't want me to contact her, but I only want to thank her for turning me into the person that I've always wanted to be. If only for a short time. I am only left to personalize my internal devotion, and hope that somewhere, she will know this enough to be true. So many lies. And if you play with fire, you're bound to get burned."
3,"I love wicked games, but the other songs are good too","Wicked games is definately the best song on this CD, but Spanish Games, and others, are also excellant. This is a great CD for when you want to just sit back and relax. I just love Chris Isaak!!"
2,A one song CD,"This is a bad CD the only good song on here is ""Wicked Game"" other than that its pretty boring. Since I have made and mp3 of the song I doubt I'll ever crack out this CD again"
1,"Boring, except for Wicked Game","All the songs sound alike and/or are boring, except for Wicked Game, which is lovely. Too bad. Chris has such a lovely voice."
5,Absolutely Mesmerizing,"This may sound nuts, but I never really heard of Chis Isaak until I heard snippits of Wicked Game in a commercial, and I had fits trying to find out what it was. Then one night I was running channels and came across a ""Friends"" rerun and there it was -- then I only knew it as the ""song"" played when 2 people first made love. And this is definitely a song that goes along with memorable moments. The words, the music, the vocals are spectacular -- they are moving, so smooth -- you can just put that song on, sit back, close your eyes and use your imagination. The entire disc is good -- but Wicked Game is definitely the reason I bought it."
2,It Just Doesn't Click,"""Beware My Lovely"" did not work for this reviewer: A war widow, Ida Lupino, hires Robert Ryan as her new handyman. The audience already knows that RR has murdered another employer in a different town. What could have been a noir classic falls flat. Ryan fails to generate anything resembling fear or danger and Lupino never seriously portrays a stalked woman. There is little use in remonstrating that both leads had more success in other films. Film fans are well aware of that. Silver and Ward's ""Film Noir"" opines that ""by 1952, the noir cycle was going into decline. Many elements previously thought emotionally affecting had become predictable through overuse"". Or it may simply be that BL is just not a good movie and certainly not solid noir. The amazon community is encouraged to pass BL by."
3,"Generic, except....","The first two CDs in the set cover the early years, the classics and standards heard at every tango dance competition around the world. Nothing much to add there.Oh, but, the third CD! It features some of the best Tango Chill (Nuevo Tango, Tango Electronica, pick-your-own-cool-tango-expression). This alone makes it worth the price of the whole set."
5,Great book written by Notre Dame student,"I'm so glad I found such a great book that really spoke in great detail about Notre Dame. Everyone interested in the school should pick up a copy as soon as they can, because there is so much great information available inside, it's better than simply going on a campus tour. Even an overnight won't tell you all that this book has to offer. Each section has student quotes and grades, and better yet, the entire book is student written."
2,"""The"" Best Reggaeton Producer !!!","El que todos los pega!! Elielll!! Here's the latest in production from VI Music featuring some new producers..Fade & Escobar. The album needed a little more colaboration on it and the removal of Mario VI & Valentino...Best song on the CD..?? ""Duelo"" by Glory...""negra con los ojos chino""."
3,Protective,"It took me a while to get used to typing on my MacBook after I put this protector on since it changes the ways the keys feel. This product was mailed to me folded up in an envelope, and unfortunately the top corners kind of roll up and don't stay down. The protector does an okay job of keeping my keyboard clean. Instead of dust getting stuck under my keys, now dust gets stuck between the ridges of the keys on top of the protector, and it's somewhat of a bother to clean. Dust and crumbs still somehow find their way under the protector though, but I guess not as much as before. My biggest complaint is that when I close my MacBook, the protector leaves an imprint of the keys on my monitor, which drives me crazy because it's difficult to clean and leaves faint squares on my monitor. It's annoying, but I love the color of it."
4,"Good overall, a few problems","Hard to feel the home keys through it, but it can be done. Good overall."
2,"good cookbook, if you dont mind waiting 3 months for it","This was ordered right before Christmas and was received first week of March. Completely ridiculous.... The cookbook is nice, but service was extremely poor!!!"
2,The best novel I've read,"It is a good book, i read the Chinese version in my 20 ten years ago. And i wanna read the English wersion now."
3,well... its a book,"I'm not really into the feminist stuff, but it did teach me some historical figures."
3,It grows on you...,"Although I was terribly depressed that I spent $ dollars on this movie and didn't really like it the first time, I kinda like it now. It really does grow on you. I recommend it to anyone who likes a VERY 70's type atmosphere, interesting story line, and, of course, the one and only ROBBY BENSON! If you don't like it the first time, give it another chance! :)"
2,INCREDIBABLY SAPPY,About a blinded young skatetress who goes off to the races anyway. Jealous boyfriend hockey type can't decide if he should help her or hurt her. So why not do both? Love attempt is often nauseating as Daddy thinks sheshould give it up too! A KLEENEX ALERT! for all the wrong reasons.
2,Disappointing/Not What I Would Call Family Viewing,"I read an article in which Lynn-Holly Johnson described this movie as a good family movie. She definitely should be proud of her accomplishments in the acting line as it was good that way, but I'm afraid I have a different view of what movies are appropriate for family viewing. I found the film to contain way too much swearing and it really took away from the story line which was not too bad. I am the first person to enjoy unrealistic, predictable movies with a romantic story line, but even this one was too unrealistic for me. However, the story was inspiring in that she overcame her disability and was able to figure skate again."
5,Exceptional Story,"I first saw this when it was relatively new. I had serious doubts that anything staring Robbie Benson would amount to anything--I was wrong. Now years later I saw it again, on Christmas Day. Back then I thought it was good. I now know this is a great film. Not every scene is perfection, but a majority of it is. One thing I noticed on second screening, was there was more to this story than a girl overcoming obstacles and the odds. There are two other important elements which I think raises this film as great: the intricate play between power and innocence, and a finely woven dramatic fear of abandonment. These themes run through all of the characters in the film--not just the girl. This same Christmas I started reading Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings's THE YEARLING . While I didn't do this on purpose, I was surprised to find that they tell essentially the same story."
2,Get Out Your Hankies!!,"Terms of Endearment on Ice.....This film is a box of Kleenex waiting to be consumed. Farfetched, poorly acted, but it all hurts oh so good! A must have for families with young skaters. My daughters (9 & 11) LOVE this movie!Besides, its a chronicle of early Tom Skerritt!"
2,Too much for young girls,"I remembered loving this movie as a girl, especially the skating. I selected this movie for a family member to purchase for Christmas for my 8-year-old. I knew it was rated PG but thought that would be OK. It seemed more appropriate than the PG-13 movies she's attracted to. The language and profanity was too strong for my taste. There were several G-- D--n and B-ss----. They were frequeent as well. My 13-year-old daughter watched it first. Not sure I'll allow her sister to view it now."
1,stopped after 5 minutes into movie,"'ice castles 1978' stopped the movie after several obscene word explosions and several obscene misuses of the word 'God'. writeup sounded nice and lured us in, but nowhere did i see obscenity listed on the product rated PG."
3,sappy but fun,"A movie not very true to the real world of figure skating. ... but many a teenage girl will love it.Starring lynn Holly Johnson and Bobby Benson ( the voice of Beast n the Disney movie Beauty and the Beast.) Story of a young girl with dreams of going to the Olympics only to have a terrible accident and going blind... but this she over comes with the love and help of her boyfriend and ends up triumphing through it all.it is not perfect, but an okay movie. If you are looking for reality this is not it"
4,Nice family movie.,"Good conversation starter with kids about overcoming challenges and the value of friends and family, An oldie but goodie. Enjoyed it."
5,Still Love This!,"I remember my older sister watching this when I was a kid. I love this movie it was just as I remember. Robby Benson is cute as ever! Lol it took about a week for my dvd to arrive , I opened it right up! I keep watching this over and over again! I'm very happy with the seller and amazon thanks again for another great order!!"
1,DVD Case was empty,"I opened the DVD on Christmas morning for my family to watch. The DVD case was wrapped in cellophane but when it was opened, there was NO DVD inside. I have contacted iPriceclub and hopefully the situation will be recified as soon as possible."
5,I want Freestyle India back!,"Maybe her voice was too big for one genre? Perhaps. But what a fun genre it is! India is the best voice to come out of the freestyle genre. You might say, well that's not hard to do considering. Yes considering that most of the gals had awful, thin, nasaly voices (then again that was their charm). BUT there's no denying India has an amazing voice [in any genre]. My only problem is that I find Salsa music to be utterly monotonous and boring. I miss the cheesy musical backdrop that Freestyle provided her.The likes of Jellybean Benitez and Little Louie Vega, powerhouses of dance music, matched up w/ India's booming voice are a match made in heaven (or sticky dance floors). Dance floor stompers such as ""The Lover Who Rocks You"", ""Right From The Start"", ""Dancing On The Fire"" and ""When You Were Mine"" alone are worth the 5 stars I've deemed this release worthy of. While Salsa's princess reigns, don't forget where she started. She'll rock you all night..."
1,BOMBA,"I came across the lp of this in a pile that was given to me by a friend who was leaving the country. It took me a few years to find out why he left it behind. IT'S A BOMB!Whatever happened to India? She was a mess then. She became a bigger mess under Ralph Mercado. Then she disappeared. I for one don't miss her, her voice or her cigars."
1,Broke on first try.,"Broke on first try! I finally got a chance to use this gift, but upon trying to remove a stuborn rounded off bolt the socket broke. Box says ""lifetime warranty"" and I need to return it but just haven't wanted to take the time to hastle with it."
1,lite jazz fusion,"They were such a great band, and there is no trace of that in this record. While the pipes are their signature sound, apparently it was the rhythm section, replaced for this recording, that gave them soul. Get 'Primeval' or 'Hard To Beat' instead (or both of them!)"
5,"""I know for sure his heart is here with me...""","Madonna's Like A Prayer is my second favorite album, my first being Ray of Light. Like A Prayer is a classic, Madonna bares her soul on every track. Her songwriting is strong here, standout tracks include: the title-track, Til Death Do Us Part, Cherish, Promise to Try, Spanish Eyes, and Oh Father. Love Song is also fresh and entertaining (a deut with Prince). The first time I heard Promise to Try I wept like a baby, so heartbreaking, the song is about her mother's death. Like A Prayer is pure genius, the perfect album to end the decade she entered in as an artist. Of course the best song is Cherish, could this song be any cuter? All hail Madonna!"
5,Can You Pray?,"Truly, Like a Prayer is the spiritual turning point for the Material Girl herself. Through various forms of singing, Madonna, yet again, proves to us that she will never run out of ideas. From the rock guitar song of ""Like a Prayer"", to the hip hop song of ""Keep it Together"", Madonna shows her captivated audience the compassion and love she holds for her family, God, and her life in one album. As one listens to the album, the songs bring life to your spirit while at the same time tell a powerful story of Madonna's past life. ""Oh Father"" certainly justifies what I have just said.Though many Christians reject this album for many reasons (one being the video of ""Like a Prayer""), I urge those looking for God to buy this album. It will make you cry, it will make you smile...it will make you think twice."
4,"I like this album, only this songs:","I like all the record, but I loved:Like a PrayerEspress Yourself!"
5,So Good,"Ah, this album reminds me of high school. It also reminded me of the fact that Madonna and Sean Penn were once married. This album is so good, and it has some juicy little insights into their tumultuous marriage. A must have."
4,Like a Prayer,"Like a Prayer is Madonnas 1989 release and her 4th studio album is not one of my favorite Madonna albums. Still it has many fine tracks, i.e., Express Yourself, Cherish , Keep it together and Dear Jessie. I never liked like a prayer mostly because I do not like gospel music. The book-let is so so. The cover art is confusing. I have no idea what she meant with this one. We get a nice list of personnel and muisicians and who played what. The lyrics could have been in a bit larger font as I find it a bit small. The center photo is a bit strange with a pose that is supposed to mean something that I have no idea what. 4/5."
2,Very Average,The Title Cut is one of her Best Songs ever.Like in Her top 3 songs Shes ever done.but the Album is Hit&Miss.Express Yourself i sone of The Most Over-Rated songs Ever.Love Song With Prince does Nothing for Neither of them.Keep it together is alright.The Title Cut though alone is a 4 1/2 alone.the rest of the Album is a One.She maintains her Trademark Sound but The Album Never Rises Again to the CHallenge of The Title Cut.
2,The two stars represent the amount of stuff I like in thiscd,"The only song I liked on this CD was ""Like a Prayer."" Madonna has a wonderful voice, but for some reason whenever I hear her music I think of her writhing around onstage and it ruins the whole thing for me."
2,Bad Bubblegum Pop,"I'm not a really a big fan of this album. Well, it just plain sucks. It's really bad 80's pop and it sounds outdated. And I love 80's music! I mean her other 80's stuff is a lot better then this crap. I was expecting her duet with Prince to be off the chain(boy was i wrong). It would be great to see them do an uptempo song together. Other then that Express yourself(well the album version is really crappy compared to the version i heard on the radio as a kid). Like a Prayer is ok, the video and concept are great. But the song overall pretty much gets overplayed way too much, even today. (its like mj with thriller,it gets old quick!)It's really not that great of a song. The only one that I really like is act of contrition. It's got sort of a rhythm nation feel to it. It's very good and creative. Other then that I would not waste two cents on this CD."
5,Her best effort!,"By and far Madonna's best album. Also check out her 2 next best, ""Ray Of Light"" and ""Erotica."""
5,MADONNA 'S PRAYER,"THIS ALBUM IS MY 3RD FAVORITE MADONNA ALBUM IT'S GOT SOME OF HER GREATEST WORKS ON IT.LIKE EXPRESS YOURSELF,THE TITLE TRACK LIKE A PRAYER,AND OH FATHER ARE JUST SOME OF MY FAVES THIS CD IS EASILY ONE OF HER BEST WORKS."
5,it is good,I like the song Like A Prayer I't is a very good song I think it is relaxing it has a soft tune.
2,ONE OF THE WORSE RE-ISSUES OF THE 2012 MADONNA VINYL SERIES - LIKE A PRAYER,"I saw all five re-issues in person and am peeved that the original prints weren't use to re-create these album images. Like a Prayer suffered the worst from this because the cover looks blurry and lifeless. I was most excited to get this one since ""Like A Prayer"" was the first album I purchased (back in 1989). This reissue also clearly didn't have any patchouli splashed on it.In second place, Like A Virgin doesn't have the same tint as the original cover and is much darker. The image on the back is also no longer flipped upside down but is now right side up which didn't keep with the original album lay-out.With that said, the best looking re-issues happen to be ""True Blue"" and ""Erotica"" and finally the ""Madonna"" album seems to have an improved cover with the brightening of the image."
4,Madonna grows up,"First of all I'm not a Madonna fan. When this album came out in 89, me and my buds were all hardcore headbanging maniacs. If anyone even knew I had this album, my life might have been over. Why did I buy it? 1989 was a crazy year for me, (left home on bad terms, bitter/sweet first love relationship, experimentation). Anywho when I first heard the song Cherish, I said to myself 'Wow wouldn't it be great to have someone feel that way about me? Then I heard Oh Father, and I had to break down and buy the record. It's not my kind of music, but it really struck me, and I still listen to it now and then (Hey I still headbang too! ) It's very listenable, I espescially like 'Act of Contrition'. The only dive nose tune is the godawful duet she does with Prince. It's so terrible my finger is on the FF button before it even starts. If not for that one tune, I would have given it five stars."
3,Not one of my favorite Madonna CD's,"I recently bought this CD along with her other 80's music. I had high expectations because ""Like a Prayer"" is one of my favorite Madonna songs. Having said that...only her released singles were the best part of this album. I do respect the fact that she made this a personal album, but to me it came off as kind of boring. I now have all of her studio albums, and I would rank this as one of the worst ones."
5,Great Album,"First off...this is a great Madonna album but it was way overrated.There a few fillers on this album.The highlights of this album include Cherish(my fav.),Like A Prayer,Oh Father,Promise To Try,Keep It Together,and Dear Jessie.....Express Yourself I think is one of the worst songs Madonna has ever recorded....I just cannot get myself to like it.But as for that track the rest of the album is good...Make sure you pick up a copy of it!"
5,Madonna's best,"This is the best album Madonna ever produced. She basically came out and said, ""I'm a pervert and you better accept me for it."" I'm not sure it was for the best reasons. She made a football field worth of money off of it. But as far as the bottom line is concerned, she did create space for people with bizarre sexual proclivities. We need more pop stars with brains like hers. (Able to make something utterly cynical into something that also helps other people out.) She remains utterly wicked."
4,Madonna - Like A Prayer,Product Quality is good bot the case is broken. Amazon please check before shipping out. This made me angry.
3,LUKEWARM,"Many fans consider this one of Madonna's best.Sorry guys, i just can't bring myself to like it at all...the only 3 tracks i think to be worth on this CD are PROMISE TO TRY (now that's a praying-related lyrics, definitely not LIKE A PRAYER or PRAY FOR SPANISH EYES...), CHERISH (which is in my opinion the only tune that holds on to her original pop hits)and KEEP IT TOGETHER (just perfect for the dancefloor, autobiographical to the point and radio friendly).EXPRESS YOURSELF and OH FATHER are not the masterpieces some people brag about, the duet with Prince is something that feels as if born out of pure commercial marketing, and the rest...well, lukewarm to say the least.She is an everchanging artist, you are right. And the album is nevertheless better than the average productions.But this album sounds very fake to me..."
4,Her best work,"The definitive Madonna Album. Depth, melody and sincerity. This is one of the eighties' essential albums. Timeless."
4,Classic Queeen Madonna,You can't go wrong with this CD. i purchased this because I was a young teenager when this came out and it brings back a lot of memories.. worth getting
5,Like Her Best Album Ever,"Mostly a country-music listener, I've been a 'kind-of' fan of Madonna's ever since ""open Your Heart"" in '87. That is, I consider her a great artist and own a few of her albums (besides this, I own ""Something to Remember"" and ""American Life"")but I am not a huge fan. I really love both ""Like a Prayer"" and ""Cherish"", but my favorite song on this album has to be ""Till Death Do Us Part"", a fantastic, heartbreaking song with a great beat."
3,A Swamp Teacher comes to Class,"Miss Nelson had to get her tonsils out,so her class had a substitute teacher. The class was afraid they would get Miss Swamp as their substitute teacher . The principal was the first substitute . He was very boring,so the class disguised themselves as Miss Nelson. Then the class went to the movies and got candy. Miss Nelson saw the children and called the principal. The principal did not believe her. Miss Nelson really was Miss Swamp,so she dressed up in her Miss Swamp clothes and went to class. She tricked the class and then came back to school as Miss Nelson again.I thought is was a pretty good book."
1,Not what I ordered,"I ordered the wizard of OZ costume thinking it would look like the picture. As I was going to wear it to work. I work with special needs children and thought this would be a good costume, as it does not look too revealing. What I received was completely different. It was a short revealing costume and not at all appropriate. I am very disappointed with the costume and this company."
3,Not as good as some of my others,"I'm happy the other reviewers enjoyed this book so much but it sounds like they were able to complement it with videos and demonstrations. Without those, I find the book less accessible than some other books. The quilts are pretty. But I would think that the specific title would be honored in the book: look at the cover. There are diamonds. Maybe I'm too picky. But I paid the full retail price. You'll like this book if you buy it for less and already know a little about quilting."
2,You get what you pay for,"This is one of the least expensive feature-packed mp3 players around but with all the bells and whistles come lots of glitches and inconsistencies. The first unit had to be returned after a software problem burned it up in the first two weeks of use. I'm now 10 months in with the replacement and have learned never to count on this unit- sometimes it works great, sometimes not at all. The WMA format support ended last month. I have never had more than 90 minutes of music on the rechargeable battery even after 10 hours of charging. With an alkaline battery it plays fine for up to 6 hours. The sound quality is good and the expansion slot is a must but I wish I would have spent a little more for something I could count on."
1,do buy this,could not get it to down load anything. Could not get the radio to play corectly and the battery wears down within only a few minutes. I have a Sandisk and it is a thousand times better.
5,very sturdy and comfortable,"After having spinal surgery, I was looking for a stand with a seat i could sit and be comfortable in. I used to be able to sit for about two hours and had to leave.Now i can sit all day. If you have back problems id reccomend this one, make sure you have friends to carry it in for you its heavy"
3,speak freakin' english,"The last dorkwad left a review in tagalog. HELLO, we're wanting to buy this book to learn the language because we don't already know it!!"
4,A long time coming...,"I'm so happy to have the demo songs readily available now!! Witches Sabbath is just an incredible tune. Sure, these songs are a bit raw, but they rip, especially being on a demo from '83! The 2 new songs are good, but I mainly bought this for the demo. If you haven't checked out Psycho Psycho yet, I urge you to do so. It's a delicious feast of metal!"
3,"Nasty Savage : ""Wage Of Mayhem""","I'm a huge Nasty fan, so when I saw this, I bought it immediately. Not that it was a mistake, but it certainly isn't the masterpiece I expected it to be....The song ""Wage Of Mayhem"" is kind of weak for Nasty standards IMO. It's not bad, but it's just not the same force that Nasty Savage laid out on ""Indulgence"" or ""Penetration Point"". Age may finally be catching up to Nasty Ronnie and the crew....However, the thing I really like about this release are the demos. They are fun to listen to in their uncut stages, and have an old school feel to them as a result. The song ""Witches Sabbath"" is incredible, and it makes this release worth purchacing if your a collector of anything Nasty Savage has released....That's basically what I would consider this. A collector's item, with a 3 1/2 star rating...."
2,More than a little outdated,"Although published in 1999, this book is more than a little outdated. About 1/3 of the book centers on the utility, ""Novell Administrator for Windows NT"". The book touts the utility as a free snap-in to NWAdmin, allowing a network administrator to administer NT Workstations and Servers through NDS. Herein lies the major problem with the book: the ""Novell Administrator for Windows NT"" is no longer available. It seems that after speaking with a Novell salesperson that the replacement is ""NDS Corporate Edition"", which is certainly NOT free. I have not figured out whether the book's content concerning Novell Administrator for Windows NT applies to NDS Corporate Edition, and I am not willing to pay thousands of dollars for the NDS Corporate Edition product to test it out."
3,Compare with Sybex,"This book is definitly not for the CNE elective, but u will learn alot of it. Shall be a good reference book.Other Sybex book is too out-dated."
4,Good info from the Novell side - a little dated,"The first part of the book is review of how NT and Novell work, pretty basic stuff. Chapter 4 is the best part of the book - it lays out what your options really are (or were 2 years ago). The rest of the book goes into detail on each of the options outlined in chapter 4, then throws in some extra stuff on ZEN and scripting. Overall it was very helpful, but unfortunately dated. There have been many significant developments in this area since this book was written that, of course, aren't in the book (ie Win2K, eDirectory, single sign-on, etc.) Its also definitely slanted towards the Novell way to approach this issue with the MS options mostly omitted or only briefly mentioned. A good place to start if you're coming from the Novell side, but you'll need more than this get the whole picture."
2,Microsoft bashing,"I'm no great fan of Microsoft, but the authors spend so much time bashing Microsoft that I could not finish the book.What a turnoff.This is an official Novell Press book, and if I wasn't sure if Novell hated hated M$ before, I am now.They really could have taken an unbiased view, and presented me with facts, instead of taking every opportunity to rip their competition.Not recommended. Want mine?"
5,Nice case,This is a kewl case nice color I dropped my phone and nothing happened nothing broke I'm definitely going to buy another case.
4,Excellent as usual; Collin's voice & song choices are great.,"I bought this because I've really enjoyed Collin Raye's last 2 CDs and also like the single off this CD very much. I wasn't disappointed-his songs on this seem to be more emotional in nature than his usual music and he wrote a few of the songs on this CD which is unusual for Collin. I don't know if Collin has become more religious of late but there is a definite Christian bent to his music on this one. I guess his past music has reflected that too-""I Think About You"" for example. Collin is terrific in concert so go see him if you get the opportunity."
4,Good for Teachers and Homeschoolers,"This book has helped me get my homeschoolers to write some interesting and fun essays. It's filled with lots of good ""story starters"" such as ""Describe your life as an alien would see it."" Good stuff."
5,the palomino waltzed,"I ordered this CD on the strength of Phil Cunningham's background and that it had included ""Leaving Glen Affric"" a mournful song of leaving behind. Beautiful cd, slow airs, reels, jigs, perfection. A strong sense of scottish folk, with some of Ireland mixed right in."
4,These Aren't MY Selections for Greatest Hits,"I've been a Hank Jr. fan since the late 70s. There are many of his songs that I consider to be among my favorites. None of these makes the cut for me. Even so, most of these were popular songs. Each has the ""Hank Jr."" feel to it and is done in his combination honky-tonk/good ole boy style. It is a style that began to wear a bit thin in his later career but the staleness is not quite present in these selection.Fans should appreciate this collection. I think it fine but nothing to write home about."
4,One of the best GREATEST HITZ,Now I'm not going to lie Hank Williams Jr. and Sr. are my favorite (country) singer(s) and I love just about all their music. If you love Hank get this CD. If you only some of Hank Jr.'s stuff at its best then still get it. This is definitely worth every penny.
1,Not very good quality,"I hate to give bad reviews, but I feel like I need to warn others. One of the rocks/beads fell off shortly after I got it. I'm sorry to say, it just wasn't what I expected."
4,This will help you.,"Going on a 6000 km trip on a bike you do not know, a manual like this is of great use. It is well organised, and I find it as good as the Haynes manuals. Only problem is that it very large since it covers both Katana's and GSX-R's."
1,stay away from this one,"Hello, I own this attractive looking power supply simply because Computer Geeks offered it for a low price of $26.99 and I was curious to see what it was.It is good to look at and much work in its making but total out of standards. I tried to fit it in four different cases (cooler master, inwin...) and did even try grinding the case. The ribbed aluminum shell is too wide and the flimsy grill over the radiator is held by tiny watch screws that come off and strip in the process.It is made most likely to fit one particular case and not others at all.The ignorance is evident when comes to SATA connectors. The ledge around the terminal is in conflict with the SATA DATA connector next to it on the peripheral device such as CDROM or Hard drive. It has to be ground or shaved off. I tried just fitting it and it broke my DATA connector on HD removable caddy. There goes my savings not buying it from Amazon. I did put it in the attic to avoid more losses."
5,Cuneesi Rum Truffles,"Had some sent to me for Christmas by my Sister who lives in Italy. They are among the best confections I've ever tasted, and I've been fortunate to have had the opportunity to sample MANY international goodies!"
1,fog cloth,"I do not like these, because they are so small fo the price I had to pay for them. I am sending the one I got back and I want the full price I paid for them to be return to me."
2,Meh,"Didn't work that well. Try out the Spit (real product name) as I thought it worked better, however you need a sink. With the clothes, you can carry it anywhere and apply. They are better than nothing, but not as good as Spit."
1,Huge waste of time.,I kept waiting for something to happen. I like Laura as a comedy actress. She doesn't cut it as a dramatic actress. Also the plot of the movie was pretty stupid. Wouldn't recommend that anyone waste their time watching this story that goes nowhere.
4,Nina Takes A Lover,"I have'nt viewed this movie as of yet. I'm a big fan of Laura San Giacomo.I watch her on the show just shoot me. I also have the movie ""The Stand"",even though it was a small part in this movie I thought she was great in The Stand.I also have another movie that I thought Laura was wonderful in ""Quigly Down Under"". Before I saw Laura On tv I only knew her from a few movies.The movie ""Nina Takes A Lover"" I only just found out about I don't know to much about this movie other then what I have read on the internet. I have tried to order this movie but for some reason they told me they can't get it is this movie out of print i asked they could'nt give me a answer. so I thought that i would try the internet.I'm glad that I did.If this movie is as good as The Stand and Quigly Down Under I'm sure I'll enjoy this movie also.Thanks,A Fan Of Laura San Giacomo"
2,Techno-Orientarism,"There is a mistranslation in the article about Japanese technoporn. The writer(translator) confused the word ""angel"" with ""nurse"". Some other misreadings about Japanese popular culture are seen. The writer and editors had to ask the Japanese speaker to read the proof. The part of teenage hackers also reqire the proof reading about computer history. (New Hackers Dictionary or RFC online documents will be helpful for readers.)They represent minority cultures as they like ... it may call as the techno-orientarism."
4,Great stereo for the price!,"I consider my self an audiophile, and I was looking for an inexpensive stereo for my wife's car. I researched a lot of stereo's and found the Sony (CDX-CA700X) to have the most bang for the buck. It has Lots of feathers and lots of power. The only drawback I found is that it is difficult to put in the face plate. I think you would be impressed with this low priced but impressive car stereo."
4,Good little book for the price,"I recently purchased a cockatiel (actually adopted it at a pet store that accepts animals people don't want anymore) and am really enjoying him. As for this book, you can probably find a lot of the info in it on the web, but I like having this relatively inexpensive book and found it worth the cost. It's not packed with information, but does provide a good amount of valuable information for people who aren't cockatiel experts, and it doesn't take a long time to read. Though, in certain areas, I would have liked to see some real photos in it that show what the book is describing."
3,"Fun Book, for New owners of Cockatiels","Hi! I totally agree with the person who said something like: a fun little book with not a lot of information in it...that's why I was surprised some people thought it had lots of info.I think if you have these birds as I do and did for 6 mo. before getting this book, you will pretty much already know at least 75% of this books info. Still a very cute gift to give a new cockatiel owner. Also, after I bought it here,I saw it cheaper at other stores...sorry amazon."
2,If they opened up his chest they would find a formula where his hart should have been.,"A professor (Claude Rains), ""the Old Man"" needs no new fangled instrumentality to tell him what he can figure out by calculus. Yes a mysterious planet (planet means wanderer) from another galaxy is on a collision course with earth. However the math does not add up when the planet instead of just missing earth takes up orbit. What can this mean? The professor says we must destroy it immediately.If the sci-fi thriller part is not enough we have budding love stories to boot.If the love angle is not enough we have a poor little doggy looking up to see if his master will return.Standard space movie with good guys (us) vs. bad guys (them) and they have a secret that only those that are not tone def can fathom.They Came From Beyond Space"
3,"Candy is okay, wrappers are bad","The candy tastes fine, but the wrappers are flimsy and stick to the candy. When you open each piece, you have to painstakenly remove the wrapping."
2,God Deserved a Better Sequel,"Lackluster sequel to ""Oh, God!"" (1977) offers little new and plays like a 1980 made-for-TV movie. The only saving grace is the inimitable George Burns, who delivers his one-liners with customary élan. Skip ""Book II"" and proceed to the superior final installment, ""Oh, God! You Devil"" (1984)."
2,Surprisingly below par from this respected conductor,"Richard Hickox has a large recorded output, a product of his reputation for fresh, reliable interpretations. But this Mozart Requiem sounds like outtakes from a rejected session by Neville Marriner. It's correct and dull, without any imaginaiton or even aspirations to be interesting. The vocal quartet consists of English stalwarts doing a bored job on a Sunday in St. Paul's Cathedral. At times the choral singing gets a bit pugnacious, although it mostly coasts along. I would avoid this one, even at bargain price."
3,It's pretty good,"This is a pretty good recording of Mozart's Requiem. The chorus and the orchestra have pretty good balance. It's not the best that I've heard, but it's not the worst either."
2,Bland!,I picked this cd up while visiting Ireland with the expectation that it would be the type of album that I'd want to hear repeatedly. Instead it contains mostly very bland songs with very average instrumental arrangements. A disappointment coming from such a talented singer with such a marvelous voice. I believe that Ms. Black needs better material that is better suited to her capabilites. I will certainly think twice before I purchase another Mary Black cd.
5,Joy! Soaring Spirit!,"This is the first Mary Black recording for me. To be sure it will be the 1st of many. As a musician and storyteller, I am touched at a deeper level.The joy in her voice is the like a special sunrise across the beloved Lake Superior rocks in the UP of Michigan. The smoothness of her voice takes me back to those shores and her words wash away my tension like the fog being washed away on the rocks of Copper Harbor.To choose a favorite is very difficut for me but the strength of her delivery of ""Fields of Gold"" makes me stand back and smile softly. Even the different feel of ""Big Trip to Portland"" has a very uniqueness to me.Thank you Mary for lifting my spirit today. I want to dance. I want to sing. I am going to play guitar.Blessing to all."
2,I must be getting younger...,"Mary Black has had my heart in my throat many times before - she's a beautiful passionate singer and some of her earlier CD's are high on my Desert island discs list but this....this is elevator music. Mary, the songs and the band just don't gell and occasionally (the wince-inducing Cut by Wire is a good example - Lord Franklin must be rotating violently in his tomb) miss by a mile. Before I heard this I would have said that Mary was 100% conviction if you needed a handy definition; now that I've heard this suburban sampler for the Keltique (tm) crowd I'm not so sure. Sorry Mary, I've loved your work for years but I can't get along with this CD."
1,Forgetable,"Her worst album. Much of the material has been done better by others (Eva Cassidy singing Fields of Gold; Dougie Maclean doing Turning Away and Broken Wings; Cry, Cry, Cry doing Speaking with the Angel) or isn't worth doing once (Message of Love is irritating). This seems like something she just slopped together for the sake of having a new album. I own all of her recordings and have played holes through them all, but I can't even remember the names of the songs on this one."
5,Mary: an angel!!!,"I don't know what possessed a certain ANONYMOUS (of course!) person to label Mary Black's latest cd as 'unlistenable'. I can only give him or her one piece of advice: buy another cd player, or better, go to an ear doctor and have that plug removed! Her latest cd is a jewel and I listen to it every day: her voice is heaven, she sings in a very expressive way, the texts are great and so are the melodies! I can only say: 5 stars! Hope you'll soon make another cd like this one, Mary!"
2,"MARY, MARY, MARY","This one is better than Shine, but only slightly. There are some good songs... ""speaking with the angels"", ""I live not where I love"", ""Bless the road"". Some are terrible... ""Message of love"", ""Fields of gold"". All in all a mediocre cd. If you loved Babes in the woods, Circus, No frontiers, Holy ground, By the time it gets dark, even... Without the fanfare, as I have and still listen to always, you'll be very disappointed. I'm slowly losing my interest in Mary because of the last two cds, but I'll keep buying because I know she'll be back!"
4,Her best release since No Frontiers,"I don't know what kind of CD player ""music fan"" from Raleigh was using, but is sure wasn't like mine! I thought Mary was back in top form, her cover of Fields of Gold was touching, as good as it was in concert. Nice work by Donal Lunny too."
4,Excellent,"This compostion of Les Wanyika is incredible.Anybody who's a solid fun of this group from it's humble beginnings until the release of this collection will agree with me that it reflects how talented they truly are.It's entertainment at it's level best.However,the only regret is leaving out the track ""shida"" out of this meaningful collection.This is one cd any true and avid fun of this group wants to keep for it revives your spirits of the 70's and early 80's."
5,Love it,"I use this product daily. My grandmother, whom just recently passed away at the age of 99, said it's what helps you live a long life."
1,African Decolonization,I gave this book 1 star it has little if not no information about the decoloniztion of africa i do not recommend this book to anyone of any age. Please take me seriously this is a waste of time.
1,Only one decent song,"Purchased CD for one song - From the Underworld - hoping there might be some other decent songs on it (it is after all a ""best of""). Boy, was I wrong. The rest of the album is complete rubbish but still happy to buy for that one song which I couldn't get anywhere else."
4,Vintage Bette,"A tad dated, but then again, this was filmed eon's ago. If you love Bette, then get this DVD, it's funny and true to Bette's form!!"
1,"5 Star Show ,4 Star Movie, 1 star DVD","I saw ""Midler on the Hoof"" the Broadway title of this show twice, the theatrical realease of this film at least as many times.I'd already seen the abridged video tape , so knew what to expect from this DVD.What I didn't expect however was the atrocious sound quality ,specifically the recorded volume level on this DVD .Even at full volume you can barely hear her.The contrast on the video wasn't monitored either.Someone just didn't care enough to do quality control on this one.Muted Midler ! What a shame."
3,"Fun, But Not Bette at Her Best","This concert film of Bette Midler, filmed not long after her success in the movie ""The Rose"", is okay, but definitely lacking. Much of the program is devoted to Midler's attempt to do rock, a phase she thankfully passed through. Her trademark bawdy humor is here, but some of it falls flat or was done better in her original HBO special (not yet available on DVD, sigh). On the plus side, her live versions of ""The Rose"", ""Chapel of Love"", ""Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy"", and ""Do You Want to Dance"" are enjoyable. Picture and sound quality are fair to good.It's a passable, inexpensive disc that will do till Bette's orginal HBO special comes to DVD."
3,Ok Concert Perforamce,"For starters, to get a better understanding of Bette at her best in concerts one needs to try to get their hands on a copy of her 1997 HBO special Diva Las Vegas which shows Bette tearing the stage up. This 1980 performance in which Bette was 34 years old and sick from the flu doesn't show her at her best in particular mainly because her full voice is not there due to sickness. There are points where she had to overrecord on certain songs because they sounded that horrible. The comedy routines work well and so does some of the songs that she sings. However, it seems as if she is very tired as well as the color of the concert is rather dark similar to her 1979 movie THE ROSE. A nice indicator of Bette in the late 70s and early 80s though. So get it for that reason too."
5,Bette Midler - Divine Madness,"Again, Bette Midler at her best. Excellent DVD. A must for all to watch. I highly recommend this DVD to everyone. Her stage presence is very exciting."
5,Always Divine!!!!,"Some people say that they are Miss M's biggest fan. THEY ARE WRONG!!! I am the ""Ultimate Bettehead!!!"" People at my work have to put up with my CD's all day, everyday. My 7 year old daughter loves this movie (of course, I had to censor some of it) but she love all the songs. We watch it together and sing every song. This is the beginning of her overwhelming extroidinary stage prescense. Her heart and soul pores out in each and every song. Do yourself a very and buy this movie!!!"
3,divine madnes,"purchased the dvd for a birthday present, to the enjoyment of the reciprocantits a girly movie, that was enjoyed"
5,Duel At Diablo,Duel At Diablo stars James Gardner and Sidney Poitier. It is a very exciting western. It is a favorite of mine. I love westerns with indians.
4,Entertaining,"Overall, this film is very entertaining. The interaction of the main characters are well defined especially Sidney Portier, James Garner,Dennis Weaver and Bibi Anderson. Lots of good action and worth viewing."
3,Duel's Duo Deliver,"This picture is a little overrated in some quarters, but does offer some good action as well as nice character touches from the two strong leads. The picture's kind of a bridge between the classic mainstream Western of the day and the more anti-heroic later 60s fare. Also, there's a more enlightened take on the Apaches, even if they are the villains for the most part.Portier's a little underused, but his caustic yet grudgingly respectful byplay with Bill Travers is one of the film's highlights. The real acting honors go to Dennis Weaver who's unsympathetic turn as Bibi Andersen's weak husband is perfectly acted.Very catchy but subtly employed Neil Hefti score."
4,Good Independent Movie with Real Life Meaning,"This movie wasn't the happiest of movie. Actually it was down right depressing. But the plot and the relationship with Wendy and Lucy was meaningful and as a big animal and dog lover myself I found meaning in this movie.Even though this movie was depressing, I gave it 4 stars as for me it was a ""what if"" movie that this could happen to anyone, and the strong bond she had with the dog was special. I wish it was happier, but I enjoyed it and made me feel good to live the way I do now and appreciate my life and my pets.."
3,A Woman and her Dog,"I really enjoyed Wendy andLucy. Maybe it would have been smarter for Wendy to look for a part time job instead of looking for Lucy. But the bond between the two was a deep one and Wendy had to do everything she could to find her lost friend. That is what it boils down to. Wendy and Lucy is a highly recommended film. It is a story that I, as a pet owner, totally relate to. Michelle Williams was really good in this film. And so was the dog."
3,"Strong performance from Williams, but to what end?","This is the other movie I watched on the plane ride (on a double feature with Nick and Norah). Wonderfully depressing movie, about a aimless loner with no money, no job and no personality. I had a hard time feeling empathy for the lead character, which means I had hard time liking this film. Michelle Williams does a terrific job conveying the desperation and loneliness of Wendy's life, and her minimilist acting is pitch-perfect for the role. I wish I could swap her out with Jolie in the 'Changeling' - one is a great movie with a decent actress, while this is a mediocre film with a great performance."
1,Boring!,I had to watch this movie for class...what an awful film. While Michelle Williams is amazing in her role - the movie had no point.
2,Half a story ...,"As a teacher of homeless youth I find it amusing that so many reviewers read historic-rendering drama into the lives portrayed in this movie. Homelessness is crude, factual, nonromantic and filled with mundane issues of surviving a life of where to sleep, getting food & money and socializing with like situated compadres. On the whole the movie and acting portrayed Wendy's journey and encounters fairly accurately although most homeless youth would have dumpster dived before risking such an obvious shop lifting. Where I have issue with this movie is this cutesy-fashionable ""leave-it-up-to-the-audience"" to finish the story. That, supposedly suspenseful yet incomplete, writing style works only rarely in literature and has no resemblance to reality - everything has a naturally occurring beginning and an end. The audience shouldn't be creating endings for someone else's beginnings. If we did then we might as well write the whole story."
3,Not quite what I had hoped,"Excellent work by Michelle Williams in this film. Unfortunately the story is fairly boring. I am drawn to tales of the dispossessed; whether the characters put themselves voluntarily into the situation or the world places them there beyond their control. I read about this film and thought it would fall right into that realm. I ended up feeling no empathy at all for Wendy and could have cared less about whether she made it out of Oregon or not. Perhaps that was the film makers intent, in that case great job, mission accomplished. Didn't work for me though. I was probably looking for a Raymond Carver story or a Townes Van Zandt song with this film and it fell far short. Oh well. Williams does put in an incredible piece of acting though."
2,Draggy and Sad,"A kind of draggy but sympathetic story of a young attractive woman and her dog as they meet hard times and encounter very disheartening down-on-your luck experiences. Since this film is very slow moving, one must rely on the fast forward button to get through time consuming scenes of inactivity."
2,In a word............. worthless.,YAWN! This makes Gummo look like an academy award movie. I've never cared less about a character. I saw it for free and still wanted my money back. Don't even bother.
3,Great toy but could be more durable,I purchased this truck for my 3 yr.old son for his birthday. He really liked the truck but some of the parts on the truck broke off within a few days of play. It is a o.k truck but it could be more sturdy.
2,Great access but absurdly disorganized,"Mr. Glatt appears to have enjoyed carte blanche access to these fabulous musicians but his book reads like he spilled his notes and put them in the book in random. One moment he's praising founder Paddy Moloney for his computer-like brain, the next we're supposed to laugh that Paddy is five hours late for a major recording session.There's some fun stuff here, but the weeds are thick!"
4,Karajan's Early Mozart & Schubert,"This CD from EMI's ""Karajan Edition"" series features the great conductor with the Vienna Philharmonic in 1946 mono recordings of Schubert's 9th Symphony, and Mozart's 33rd Symphony along with two German Dances. The featured item is undoubtedly the ""Great,"" receiving its first release on CD here. The performances overall are good but of course the poor, historical sound leaves a lot to be desired. Karajan recorded these works again in stereo for EMI in the 1970s with the Berlin Philharmonic (see my reviews), and those titles are definitely preferable. But with that being said, Herbie was never at his best with either of these composers and both this disc and the stereo remakes should be seriously considered only by the conductor's most avid followers. Most classical listeners will be better served by Karl Bohm in this repertoire."
1,No acceleration and jerky movement,"I just replaced this Kensington optical wheel mouse with a Logitech dual optical mouse. The Kensington mouse did not have a smooth movement. Also, the ""acceleration"" feature did not function. The factory customer service rep said this is standard for Kensington mice, because the acceleration feature is for a trackball. The logitech dual optical mouse is such an improvement! The dual optical sensors make it really precise, with a smooth movement! Logitech has the best acceleration function that I have found in a mouse. Also, the mouse glides on the mouse pad, whereas the Kensington mouse seemed to stick, then slip, repeatedly. Summary: buy the Logitech dual optical mouse."
2,VERY uncomfortable.,"I like this mouse because it has a cord (So no battery charging or changing required). However, I find it kind of pathetic when you have to install a driver just for a mouse. It takes up a small amount on my hard drive, but I still find it unnecessary. I replaced this mouse with a Logitech wireless mouse that required NO installation of anything! Also, (Not sure if this is just me) but the mouse tends to lag when I use it (Most noticeable when I play simple point and click games) which is VERY frustrating!! Changing the settings doesn't do anything to improve this. This mouse makes me want to go back to the days of mouses with balls. Because of the lagging with this mouse, my wrist tends to hurt if I'm on the computer for a long time (And I tend to try spending A LOT of time on computers).PS I understand that the software helps program the two side buttons, but the installation took longer than just to install the interface, it took up too much space for this one device."
1,Never got it.,"Kensinton is a good product name, but is worthless if the supplier is out of stock.That is why the 1 star. Ritzcamera was the supplyier."
1,Mac users beware: Cannot program buttons,"After downloading and installing Mouseworks, the Kensington mouse software, I found out the software doesn't work with Lion (or Snow Leopard for that matter). Kensington is aware, and has no intention of updating the software. I returned the item and have no intention of purchasing Kensington products again. I purchased it to be able to use the side buttons, but they were unusable with Mac. If you want a mouse without the side buttons, buy another one."
1,Mac no longer supported,They haven't updated the mouseworks software for mac in a very long time. It definitely doesn't work in lion (10.7) and I wouldn't be too hopeful trying to run it in 10.6 either. Saying that the mouse is (PC/Mac) is incorrect.
5,kensington wired mouse 72121,"I bought this as a replacement to my wireless mouse that kept eating batteries every few days. I play online games and when the batteries in the wireless mouse got weak it would get me and my team into trouble very quickly. So i decided i needed a new mouse and wanted to go wired just for that reason. I have nothing bad to say about this mouse. It is nothing short of amazing. Once you get it adjusted to your prefernce, I have not had any problems or bad things to say about it. Well worth the money for a great quality mouse. All the buttons including the scroll wheel work perfect and you can adjust the sensitivity of the laser to how you want it. I definitly reccomend this mouse to anyone wanting a great mouse. I see myself in the near future buying a wired Kensington keyboard to match it as well ! Great price and great mouse !"
4,Comfortable Mouse,The rubber top makes it comfortable. Some of the features don't necessarily work (or are difficult to figure out) like the side clicking which I haven't gotten to work properly yet. But overall it's a good mouse.
2,Not good for gamer ...,"I have had this mouse for about 2 months, with considerable use in FPS gaming. This mouse has a problem with lag between the time one clicks the left or right button and the actual action to take place on the screen. Not good for high action shooter games when instant response is essential. I have also found that the left and right buttons malfunction or stop working sporadically for no apparent reason. Thus my rating of two stars."
3,Great Mouse for Most Users,"I loved everything about this mouse from the time I opened the box- except for the fact that the buttons are rather stiff, and my clicks often didn't register. I'm returning it regretfully, because I like the fact that the two extra buttons can be programmed, and the general size and shape is good.I'd recommend it for people with medium to large hands, though. It's just a bit big for someone with small hands. It's definitely not for people who have arthritis or other problems with stiff buttons. Most people would get used to them after a while I think."
3,Fair economy mouse,"This is a good mouse for light use. I tried using it for gaming but many times clicks wouldn't register during fast action. Also, in a 5 button mouse I prefer to have the two extra buttons where my thumb can easily click them to go both front and back in a browser. This mouse has the buttons on opposite sides of the mouse. It is very difficult to press the button on the opposite side of the thumb."
4,Solid Mouse,"My old mouse died on me so this was a quick replacement. I was pleasantly surprised at how well it was made. It's been about a month, and I have very few complaints with it. Only problem really is the placement of the side buttons, but that is probably because I am used to the Microsoft Intellimouse. Overall, great mouse and I would definitely buy it again for the price."
4,Nice mouse - but a bit clunky.,"This was bought alongside the more basic ""72123 Mouse-in-a-Box Optical"" (non-Elite), and I honestly prefer the smaller, cheaper model. This is a bit over-sized for smaller hands and the buttons are a bit less ""crisp"" if you will. The extra 2 buttons on the mid-section would be welcome, but they are not really placed in a position that makes them easy to use. They aren't even as convenient as Apple's ""Mighty Mouse"" squeeze function, which I never have learned to like either. Still a very good mouse, but not worth the premium over the basic model to me."
5,great mouse,"I love this mouse. It's comfortable to hold, and has a nice grip to it. The 5 buttons come with software that is mac compatible, making this my favorite pointing device."
4,I COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN,"Dawn Powell is without a doubt one of the most remarkable writers of this century. Anyone who wants to know how this country truly looked, sounded, and felt in the 30's, 40's & 50's owes it to themselves to stock up on her books. Her New York novels, like ""The Locusts Have No King"", can be almost savage in their bitingly hilarious portayals of life in mid-century Manhattan and Greenwich Village. ""Dance Night"" is something else, entirely. Powell brings the grubby town of Lamptown, Ohio to aching life; you won't soon forget her finely-etched characters and their desperate efforts to create some happiness among the cargo trains and factory whistles and backsteet affairs that define the limits of their lives at the dawn of the Great Depression. I can't recommend this book highly enough. Powell fans may want to order a copy of ""The Best of Dawn Powell"", as it contains ""Dance Night"", ""Turn Magic Wheel"", and a collection of short stories."
4,American Classic,"This novel of early 20th century Ohio deserves a place with the novels of Willa Cather and Theodore Dreiser. Unlike Dawn Powell's satirical New York novels, this is a straightforward and touching story of a young man growing up and growing out of a stifling small town. The story paints a wonderful picture of a simpler time in our country. This portrait, along with Powell's knack for characterization and interesting plot turns, make the book a treasure."
3,Old fashion rock and roll,"This is just plane rock and roll. It sounds like something from the 60's or the 70's, and reminds me alot of Creedence Clearwater Revival.It's a very cool record. It's fun and it always get's me in a good mood. This is a classic guitar rock album, with fast songs, so it's hard to sit still while listening to it.Change my mind is their best song, and it's a great song. Semi acoustic rock song with cool guitar riffs. It's one of my favorite songs.Bad day, Ellie Meadows, Stupid ones and Love boat are also great songs you should check out.If you like old rock and roll like Creedence, Rolling Stones or whatever you'll will problaby like this."
5,"If you don't want a book, get the PDF version!","This text was published by Prentice-Hall, Inc., in 1984.It remains the definitive work on analytic modelling ofcomputer systems.The publisher has returned the copyright to the authors,who made the material available for viewing ordownloading, in Adobe Acrobat PDF format.Do a Google search for ""qsp.zip"" or ""Quantitative System Performance""."
3,the river review,This was a page turning because when I started reading it at first I couldn't stop reading it because every time I tried stopping another good part would take place. No this story was not hard concentrate on because I enjoyed reading it. I like the genre because it's about our time period. I also enjoyed the writing style. There were many parts in this story that surprised me. One part that surprised me was when Derek was struck by lightning. Not every chapter ended with a cliffhanger. This story wasn't a boringatory. I think it was one of the better books I have read. My mind did not wander while I was reading this story. The plot was unbelievable because they wanted Brian to go back on this island once again. Yes I do think 7th graders would enjoy this story because there is something always going on.
3,Adventure,"I recommend this book to kids that are twelve and up. This book is very good because it is very exciting. It shows how a teenage boy survives in the wilderness with a psychologist. This book is an adventure book. Before you read The River you should read the first two books. The first two books are Hatchet and Brian's Winter. In The River Brian goes back to the wilderness to teach Derek (psychologist) how to survive in the wilderness. Things go well until a lighting bolt hits Derek. He gets knocked out. One quote that Brian told Derek is, "" I won't let you die."" At this point Brian is very scared because he doesn't want Derek to die. Derek is feeling that he can't save Derek. Even though he told Derek that he wouldn't let him die he still felt worried. One of my favorite quotes that Brian had said was "" I can't give up"". This is a good quote because Brian knows he can save Derek."
2,Disapointed,"After reading Hatchet and then reading Brian's Winter, I was disapointed about this story. Having Derek involved screwed the whole survival story. Paulsen should be ashamed for ever releasing this clear downer"
3,the perfect sequel,"In the sequel to Hatchet, a psychologically hardened Brian is convinced to go back into the wilderness with Derek, a psychologist for the government that wants to study Brian's survival skills. Things start off well, until Derek is hit by lightning and comatose. Now Brian must navigate a river in order to save Derek. A strong, exciting sequel that appeals to young readers interested in wilderness and survival, but with a more psychological twist (particularly as Brian must take care of someone else) than the incredible predecessor. Grade: B+"
2,The River,To me the book the river really didn't make sense to me. And brian all what he did was drag Derek around.
4,The River,"The RiverThe river is a wild extravaganza, that Brian volunteers his self to explore and teach FBI agents the ways of the wild. Along the way Brian is filled with mi8shaps, and wrong direction. I would recommend this book to anyone who has read Hatchet, Brian Winter, or Brian Return. The river is an action packed slash suspenseful wild river ride."
3,Great book,The River is kind of like Hatchet. It has Brian and one more person namer Derek who got hit by lightning. Does he live or Die? After they stey in one plase they caneu about 100 miles or more. I canued for 3 miles before but I was out of the boat for 1.5 miles. Will they servive for that long? where will they get there food? and where will they get help?
4,describing what is the obvious,this book was incredible. the detail was superb with all the added things such as when brian always thinks about one word and how paulsen describes the place and what is happening. excellent.
5,The River,"I would recommend this book to any adventurous students who like excitement,adventure and a good book.It is worth reading.I would recommend this book for ages 9-14."
5,The River,The RiverI really like this book. I like the way that Gary Paulsen acts like he is in the book or he is the one that is out on the lake with no way out. Brian is the main character. He brought a guy with him this time. Last time Brian was alone this time he was not. The guy copied every thing he did .the book was filled with fun facts. The book was sometimes sad. There are times that the two fight. I would rate the book a ten.By David B
3,The River,"""The River"" is a book about a fifteen year old boywho has been lost in the middle of no where with only a small ax, andthe government wants him to do it again! The boy goes out there witha man from thegovernment. The man gets zapped by lightning and goesinto a coma! The radio they had brought for help is dead! Will theymake it? Read the book to find out! I like this book because of theaction. I would not recommend this book because I have read muchbetter books. Also, lots of people in my class did not like thisbook."
1,The River,"Brian was asked to go back to the woods so that Derek can observe how he stayed alive so he can teach it to army people. When they got there they found a shelter and found berries but then there was a storm and lightning hit Derek. Derek fell into a coma. Brian has to go a hundred miles to a trading post to save Derek. Will he make it?I did not like the book The River because there was not much action. Everything went to fast. When something happened it only lasted about one page, unlike Hatchet there was not a lot of troubles like he never really had to figure anything out."
1,The river,I think this book stinks realy bad. Because I downt like to read and I downt like out doorsy books. But this is just my opinion you mite like this book so read some more reviews. I give this book a 1 out of 5
2,Thw River,Over all I think the River is out of place in the series. I think that if The River was the third book in the series it would make more sense. If the book were in that order I wouldnt have been confused all the time. The book it self was ok though. It had a lot of adventure in it. I kept wanting to read more.
5,The River by: Gary Paulsen,"This book was fantastic! Brian Robeson was stranded in the wilderness for 54 days and barely survived with a hatchet. Two years later, the government wants him to go on a similar adventure with a psychologist, Derek Holtzer. The reason being is because they want to find out how Brain survived this adventure so the government can teach astronauts and the military these same techniques. When a terrible storm comes and lightning strikes Derek and the radio transmitter leaving Derek in a coma, Brian is now again on his own. He is left with nothing. Not even the hatchet. The only way to survive is to build a raft and transport Derek a hundred miles down a river to a trading post where he can find help. That is, if the map is accurate."
3,It was OK,"The book was ok. It wasn't the way I expected. I think the book should of been longer. Brian went on a raft and made it home safe, it was too short. I read Brian's winter thow and that is a excellent book, but Hatchet is the best of them all. I couldn't even put Hatchet down because it was so interesting, but The River on the other hand I could put it down because it was boring and you kind of knew what would happen if you read Hatchet."
3,The River review,"I think this book is very average, not as good as the first one, Hatchet. It's about Brian Robeson, who survived 54 days in the Canadian wilderness with nothing but a hatchet two years earlier. Now the government wants him to go back as a research for a training program for astrounauts and the military. But under a storm Brians companion Derek gets hit by the lightning and falls into a coma. Now Brian must save Derk by building a raft and travel down a river.The book is pretty slow, it's not until after about a hundred pages that their journey begins down the river. When that happened I think mr Paulsen just wanted to finish the book. However, if you really enjoyed Hatchet, I think you should read this. (Please mind my english, I'm from Sweden)"
4,A Great Book to read,"The River is a great book to read. The River is about a teenager named Brian who has to go back to the wilderness. The reason he has to go back to the wilderness is because many people want to know how he survived in the books called Hatchet and Brian's Winter. I would recommend this book for anybody. I would mostly recoomend this book to people that like crazy adventures. There is alot of action in The River. Some examples are crashing into the rocks in a river, a thunderstorm with very close lightning, and almost sinking into a river."
4,The Wilderness Throws a Curve Ball... And this time Brian's Not Alone,"Our boy Brian returns to the wilds of Canada but this time with a companion; a man who is part of a team that wants to understand how it was that Brian survived on his own with so few resources.Brian agrees to go because the information is going to be used to help others to mentally adapt to the isolation and the wild. What happens is nothing like what they planned.A good story, ""The River"" is geared more towards the juvenile shelves than the YA section. It's a lighter Paulsen read that is very adventure oriented. As an adult I thought there were moments that were a tad unrealistic. But that didn't keep me from enjoying this intriguing romp down river.mini-reviewPam T~ (booksforkids-reviews)"

3,THE BESEST BOOK EVER!,The River is about a boy who gets stranded out in the woods and is now asked by some scientists to live out in the woods again and take tests on how to survive in the wilderness. In the book I liked all of the action and the suspense. You never know what is going to happen next. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes lots of suspense and wilderness stories.
1,this book stinks!,"The River is a terrible book! i really wouldn't recomend it to anybody! I mean Hatchet(the book before this one) is alright but this book is so boring. all that happens is Brian Robeson has to drift down a river on a raft with a man in a coma and wait until he gets to a trade post for someone to save him. the book is so short but it seems to last forever because it is so boring! As I as reading the book I though ""okay this is the end finally"" and i turned the page to find four more chapters of Brian floating down the river. Honestly don't read this book it is a total waste of time."
1,The River By Gary Paulsen,"The River is a book about a boy named Brian Robeson and his survival.Brian was alone in the wilderness for 54 days with nothing but a hatchet.Yet he survived , the goverment wants him to do it again. This time he will not be alone.To learn more about this book read The River by Gary Paulsen. I thought this book was okay because in some parts of the book it is boring , but in other parts it is funny. I would recommend this book for any 4th or 5fth grader because some words may be a little harder for younger children.Plus if you like adventure or survival stories then you would like The River."
1,The River,"This book is an adventure book so if you dont like them you wont like The River. ""We want you to do it again"", says Derek Holtzer a goverment physiologist who studies how to live in the wilderness. He and Brain are going to the wilderness togther. One nightwhile they are sleeping Derk is struk by lighting and put in a coma. Brain had a close incounter with a moose it might just happen again. Some diffrences from this story from the last are that Brain has a knife not a hatchet,his plane didn't crashand, has a partner.I dont like this story because all Brain ever thinks is I think I should do this I think I should do that. I wouldnt recomend this book to young kids because they can get confused with whos who and whats what.Here are some other boooks you might want to read by Gary Paulsen, Hatchet And Brains Winter."
2,The River,In the book The River it's all about this boy named Brian and he get's lost in the woods and survived so these three guys come to his house asking if he would do the survival thing again. One man Derek Holtzer comes back when his mother is home and they go over what he wants Brian to do and the boy thinks that has to do this to teach other people how to survive. The mother says that he can go. Afte his mother says he can they take a few days to go over what they'er going to do? How long they are going to be in this place. They take off. When they get there Brian tells Derek to leave all of the equiptemnt on the plane. They make a shelter. This book was confusing to me. I really didn't like it. If you like a lot of excitment you might like this book.
2,Expedition in the woods,Hi my name is Jeff from the k team at Keigwin Middle School.Today I'm here to talk about The River.This is a book about a boy named Brian who survived in the wilderness for 54 days.Now he does it again but this time he does it with a psychologistnamed Derek.Derek wanted to go so he could learn more about survival. Derek gets struck by lightning when he reaches for the radio.Can Brian save Derek's life?I would rate this book a two out of five.
3,The River,"The River by Garry Paulsen is about a boy named Brian Robeson who was stranded alone in the wilderness for fifty-four days with only a hatchet. Two years later the government wants Brian to go back and do it again.Something happens to the man (Derek) that he goes with. I think this book is okay except for some parts go into too much depth. I recommend this book because of the fact that that it was suspenseful, you wanted to keep reading to find out what happens."
2,The River,"Brian Robeson survived in the woods for fifty-four days with only a hatchet. He was surprised to hear what the three phycologist said. They want him to do it over again.With no tool exept a knife, Brian and Derek the phycologist tries to survive in the woods near the lake. But when a terrible lighting gets Derek into a coma.Read The River to find out how they survive.I don't like this story because I think it is crazy for a kid to live in the woods with only a hathet.I recomend this book to a fifth grader.It is okay for others to read but the smaller ones might not know the meaning of some words."
2,Never failed to suprise me,"to the last chapter. Now, I knew from the past books I have read by the same author that this one was going be on the theme of ""man is so mighty that he can survive all the worst of Nature with a capital N"", but I must say, it started out good enough. But when they got to freak lightning comas and stuff, it just sort of, well, flopped. I'm sorry, but the part with the 'waterfall', it...uh well I suppose you could say it sank.No, I wouldn't recommend it. Don't bother wasting your time, unless you enjoy sop stories of Super-Nature Heroisim. I mean, it gets old. You hear one chapter and it's the same old deal.Megan K."
2,The River,"This book was not as good as The Hatchet. I think that the reason for this is because Brian had to save some guy Derek, who had been knocked out by lightning. Most of this book talked about Brian taking care of Derek. Even the ending was bad, the docters said that Derek would have been fine for another week."
5,The River,"What would you do if you were on island with a man in a comma? Well, that what thirteen year old Brian had to go through.Brian is a boy that got saved from an airplane crash in the book Hatchet. Now some people want him to go back to do everything over, so they would know how he survived in the wilderness. However, this time, Derek would also go with him, (Derek is an adult who would write down the things they did and how they would survive). Derek gets injured and now Brian has to take care of Derek, who is in a comma.This is a wonderful book for people that like to learn about new things in life and survival lessons. Gary Paulsen also wrote Hatchet and Brian Winter, too. I would recommend these books to anyone who likes to travel, so they can know how to survive in the woods, in winter, or with wild animals. So, I hope you and enjoy it like I did."
4,Good read,"I have to start off by saying that I live near Zichron so it was interesting reading about the places that I see all the time. I also enjoyed the structure of the book in that it skipped between the present and the past. Technically, Halkin is an excellent writer as shown by his many translations of leading Israeli authors from Hebrew to English."
2,"Period practice in Berlioz is fascinating, but execution needs to be better","On its own this would seem like a bizarre-sounding Symphonie Fantastqiue. The orchestra is scrawny, the strings scratchy and without vibrato, giving them an irritating zing, the winds thin and not always in tune. But of course this is period performance, which means that nobody has to be up to professional standards.Norrington is a rushed, unbending conductor of this music, as he is of most music, and although it is weirdly fascinating to hear such Berliozian oddities as the ophicleide in the orchestra (a blatty coiled metal kind of bassoon), the overall musicality isn't there. Those who like period performances would naturally disagree by a mile."
3,What Can One Say About k.d.?,"Ordinarily, I do not review CDs. God knows there are plenty of people out there to do that, and they don't need me adding my opinions of dubious value to the pile.However. However, I cannot let this particular album go by without comment. Ingenue is a superior album; one of my very favorites. I also prefer Shadowland to this one. But it was lang singing ""Pullin' Back the Reigns"" on, I believe, Saturday Night Live that made me a fan for life. That voice; those gestures; the power of the performance. It reached through the T.V., grabbed me by the ears, and *forced* me to pay attention. Other than Peter Gabriel, I have never in my life seen a performer of such dynamic power as lang. And to this day, that comes through in that track, at least to me.The remainder of the album is enjoyable, and often excellent (e.g., ""Trial of Broken Hearts""). But I bought this album for that one song, and I have never regretted it."
4,Absolute Torch & Twang,"This is a great CD, but my heart still prefers ""hymns of the 49th parallel"". Every fan of k.d. lang (or anyone who loves to listen to something quite special) should own ""hymns""-- and then buy this one for comparison."
4,Coming of Middle-Age,"Most coming-of-age tales focus on adolescents. Channeling Biker Bob treats the reader to a captivating tale of a middle-aged man coming of age and into his true, though long-buried, self. Stewart Chance wakes up to life and discovers deeper relationships with those around him, most particurlarly his wife, after he is visited by the spirit of the wise sage of masculinity, Biker Bob."
1,Glad I bought it used,"What a let down. Besides the poor grammer and editing in this book; the story was a real let down. At times the biker stories gleamed some hope of it actually having some biker philosophy, but that is short lived. And the ending; well, suffice it to say I would not recommend this book."
1,dud,I was very dissapointed - Chad Allen movies in the past have been very enjoyable. This was was a dud!
5,Really great!,"Again, I loved this one as well. They are right in saying that it is a bit difference; the focus that is. It really concentrates on the fashion and electronics; everchanging as it was. Add it to the collection and read them all."
3,"Not as good as ""Where Dey At?""","On their classic debut album Where Dey At, Lo Key? had some awesome tracks including I Got A Thang 4 U and Milkshake whereas on this the follow up, they have lost a member and some brilliance. While this album is not terrible 26 cents and Good Old Fashioned Love are quite decent there are no masterpieces like on their debut album."
3,Available on the web free!,"While this little booklet is worth reading, it is available to read on the internet for free."
5,Fun filled excitement!!!!!!!!!!,"I love this game and my son loves this game. My only criticism is that you can't save at indiscriminate points in the game you have to wait on the autosave. However, that is not so big a deal to de-star it. Its fun as Ratchet and Clank always is. The graphics are lovely. Five stars all the way for me!"
5,More of the best platforming title ever!,"While this is still a very solid entry in the series, it's the lowest one in my opinion only because the PSP's control scheme is a little hard to do the job. That said, the developers still did a wonderful job and this game is not to be missed. If you only have a PS2, spend the extra to get this game. The controls are probably better anyway."
1,I still haven't got the game,Right now I am still looking for the game that the Postal Severice had lost I hope that it will come my way soon.
3,"Very fun, but lacks area and length","This game was very fun. However, it took me about five hours to beat it. Add another week, and I have every item in the game. Luckily it's fun enough that you can play over and over again, but there is a limit. After my fourth playthrough it took me about a half-hour to beat it, and I leveled the final boss in thirty seconds with the rhino, the best weapon in the game.Pros: Pretty good plot, good graphics for a handheld game, very cool weapons, and fun mini-games.Cons: Easy, only about eleven planets to go to (the planets are not big at all), only 7 different armors, and about fifteen weapons, and maybe one or two mods for each weapon (not counting buying the Titan versions of the weapons).All in all, I'd only buy this game if you can get a used one. Or if you are a relitively inexperienced gamer, it might offer a bit more of a challenge, and could be worth the money."
2,Didn't receive a case/box for game,Was expecting to receive the actual case and booklet with the game but sadly only received the UMD ;[ for any picky gamers like myself take this into consideration when making your purchase.
4,Finally... another Fun game for psp,"I really like my PSP, but there just are not very many good games out there for it YET. I have 6 games, but only 2 stand out as any good and have replay value...this is one of them. Next to Daxter, this game is one of my favorites. I am on my way through it a second time...where I think each section is harder than the first time through, but your weapons also get better too, as well as a new one that you cannot get the first time thru! The game is similar in many ways to the PS2 versions of Ratchet & Clank, but some diehard fans may not agree. There are great weapons and worlds and creatures to conquer, and a fun story line. You also get to be a giant flying clank! The extra games are fun, as you toss mini clanks and fight robots and figure out puzzles etc. The game is shorter, but it IS a portable game after all. I thought it was fun, and I am enjoying the second time through. I am hoping for more games to be released like this one!"
3,"Great, but not for PSP","I've been a big Ratchet and Clank fan, so it only made sense to buy Ratchet and Clank for PSP. The gameplay started out great. It was challenging. The graphics were beautiful. The camera angles were a little weird, but I got the hang of it after a few minutes. It still had that wonderful R&C; PS2 charm about it. I even finished the first race!But the second race with the Skyboard Racer is impossible with the PSP joystick and controls. They are just AWFUL for these races! I've even asked another gamer who is excellent at racing games on the PSP to try to finish it and even he can't. So, as much as I love Ratchet and Clank, I can only rate this game 3/5 because it's just not fun when you can't progress in the game."
3,Babydoll is it,"The song Babydoll is a very entertaining song -- Anderson having an ongoing dialog with her brian. There are other pretty good songs on the CD, although I often find myself listening to just that one."
2,A dissenting view,"(Disclaimer) I'm not familiar with much of Laurie Anderson's work. I first heard ""Big Science"" in college in the mid-80's and loved it. Recently, I bought that album and ""Strange Angels"" together and am disappointed by the latter. This album has a distinctly mainstream 80's sound, and while it's apparent that Anderson takes a tongue-in-cheek approach to this musical form, the parody is a little too good for my taste. Fans of Anderson's offbeat and esoteric minimalist approach should be forewarned that this album may not be what they expect."
5,Great Anna Bolena,"This Anna Bolena originates from Toronto, Canada, 1985, and it has a spectacular Joan Sutherland for the title role, along with James Morris as Enrico, and Judith Forst as Giovanna. Bonynge conducts with wonderful Donizetti style(Italiainate), and the rest of the principles are excellent. Buy it and enjoy. A few cuts, but check out B Sills' recording for the complete(near?) of this fabulouis opera!"
5,Stayed in Rotation on CD-changer for months...,"I don't understand a lick of the lyrics, but the emotion in this music could raise the dead. Cheik Lo beautifully melds the sounds of West Africa and the Americas (from Tierra del to the Keys, at least!) into something unique and shimmering.I love both Bambay Gueej and Ne La Thiass, but have to admit I prefer Bambay's dynamic range. This album makes you smile, dance, and thank God that another day has arrived. I listened to this CD more than any other in the past year, and it still accompanies me on any trip I take!"
2,unimpressed,"I have this little heart-shaped flea comb that I searched high and low for before deciding to purchase the Vo-Toys Flea Comb. In comparison, it's not a good. Maybe the angle is off or maybe the teeth are too wide. Whatever the reason, it doesn't seem to fully comb out my short-hair, and it gives the fleas too much time to bail off of my long-hair.Moving to the third-floor and keeping my cats indoors and away from other pets has decreased their flea-incident to 0%.Interestingly, I found that little heart-shaped comb. This one has gone in the junk drawer."
5,The BEST Cat Brush,This is a superb cat brush! I bought one and it was such a good brush I bought another to have in reserve. It is easy to hold with a rubber handle with raised grip spots and the bristles are both regular nylon bristles and longer plastic bristles with cushioned tips. The brush curve fits the contours of the cat and we often leave the brush on the floor with the cat and he enjoys 'brushing' himself! The cat gets a complete brushing and there is no fear of hurting their eyes or nose.
5,Happy Kitty,"I used this brush many years ago when I found it at a local pet store. However, it was time to replace it and I was unable to find the exact brush anywhere. I got lucky, ordered it, and my cat loves the feel of the soft rubber tips on his coat and skin. The brush does a good job, along with the use of a comb. I would recommend this product. My cat is short haired but is a big boy with lots of hair and the brush works well."
3,"Needed, so I ordered it...","The product is as expected, and priced well. I recommend it as a suitable replacement for one missing from your kit."
4,Ya pa match!,"Il est unitile de commenter ce cd- peut-tre pour ceux qui ne connaissent pas encore Extra Musica.Shalai c'est du Matongi pur et simple, des tubes qui vont te faire vivre les matitis où que tu sois.Je regrette simplement que par moment, on pense un peu trop à Koffi. Extra Musica devrait mieux se concentrer dans son style de depuis Etat Major.Un ancien combattant a survecu une rude bataille..."
3,"An ""okay"" Collection","As a literature student, it's important for me to have read a fair share of what's ""out there"" to be read. I need to be able to sit across the table from another lit geek and now what he or she is talking about. For me, this book had a few obvious inclusions (i.e. Othello, Death of a Salesman...), a few acceptable, but still enjoyable, pieces (i.e. The Piano Lesson), and even more importantly a few gems (i.e. The Cuban Swimmer).For me this anthologoy was a hit or a miss. I would have rather seen a few more surprises and less cliched examples of drama. I don't know if I really agree with including Shakespear, but I wouldn't have used Othello. Just my opinion, but the anthology wasn't a complete flop.Also, 'Pocket Anthology?' How big are YOUR pockets?"
1,Table of Contents Would be Nice,"I haven't read the book, so this is actually a review of the info on the book. Why is there no TOC listed? How am I to decide on this book if I don't know what plays it contains. Very bad marketing."
5,Amazing Book,"Fast shipping, safely packaged. An incredible baseball book written from a fan's perspective that not only covers the details of the game, but also the emotions that go along with it."
4,great fun,"I read this as a kid and twice as an adult, now in my 50s.Wonderful simple reporting and writing approach, brings back the era when going to the park was the greatest pleasure.Curiously, his description of Willie Mays taking fielding practice is as dramatic and timeless as his description of The Catch....Tremendous book..."
3,Backache,"Long story short... I get backache after about 30 minutes carrying my daughter. I'm in decent shape and my daughter is not obese... so I think getting achy in such a short period of time is not reasonable.It does feel pretty good for the first few minutes with some lumbar support, but then the ache sets in."
5,A different sort of abandonment...,"While most people have experienced the loss of a lover, few have felt what it's like to be left for the priesthood. That's what this novel's protagonist (whose name is never given) faces, just weeks before her wedding to Eddie.Devastated, she decides to sell her engagement ring through a classified ad in the local paper. As the weeks and months pass, a verifiable circus of area residents visit the protagonist's home, giving her a glimpse of other lives and loves as she tries to recover from the loss of her own.Perhaps Shea does not provide a name for the main character because she is, in fact, just another person in emotional turmoil. This sort of situation could happen to virtually anyone."
3,Good summer reading,"Would have given 3.5 stars if it were an option. This book is perfect poolside or bedtime reading. It moves slowly enough to be able to put down, yet is interesting enough that you will pick it back up again when the opportunity arises. Strempek-Shea is very good at using insignificant details to add to the levity of the story."
3,an OK book,"I liked the Polish background of the family in the story, but the ending needs a little more twist. A good book doesn't always need a big ending but one must have an effective and believable ending to go with the rest of the story."
4,HUMOROUS AND SAD!,This book made you laugh and cry sometimes on the same page. I liked the main character but I wish she finally found someone for herself. The family was hilarious. I liked the way the author went from the past to present so nicely.
1,Big Letdown,"After reading all of the positive reviews for this book, I was really looking forward to reading it. I made it through about fifty pages before putting it in my ""donate to the library"" pile. I was raised Catholic, but I still couldn't relate to the unbelievable naivete of the characters, especially the main character. It was painful to witness, like being stuck in the 1950's! If you're looking for something of that era, I recommend Divine Secrets of the Ya Ya Sisterhood by Rebecca Wells."
4,heartbraking at times,"My first journey with Shea, and I found this book to beabsolutely wonderful. The story was for the most part very sad, theway she builds her life around the ring and how she needs to find this ""inanimate"" object the ""right"" home, is quite depressing yet at the same time understandable. We've all held onto things too long. Great book overall, the most heartwrenching aspect would be, her being left for God. Who on earth could compete? You want to hate her ex-fiancee, but you just can't, cause ultimately he is doing the admirable thing. In a nut shell - quite sweet and sad, but Shea could do with a few less run-on sentences."
1,"Just Long, Baggy Shorts","These pants are nothing more than long, baggy shorts, perfect for the ""sagging"" look and a drive by."
5,Can't live without this,I have two of these inside my linen closet door. I don't know how I'd manage without storing all my medicine chest stuff on these racks. They are a wonderful space saver.
5,Wild & Wacky Redneck Horror,"These two maniacs read some of this book at the Horrorfind Convention in 2002 and had the audience on the floor in hysterics. Droll, witty, over-the-top black humor (and genuine scares) from two of the brightest new minds in genre fiction. ""Scary Rednecks and Other Inbred Horrors"" was black-humored and amusing, but this collection manages to outshine it. Not to be missed."
4,Witty and Insightful ...,"Pico's short book is full of sharp and witty humor conjugated with intelligent insightful observations. He combines day-to-day anecdotes, personal interactions and socio-political prose with amazing dexterity. The background information provided for each lonely country visited by Pico is pretty amazing.I have traveled to some of these lonely places and can almost relive my travel experiences after reading his book (though he traveled almost a decade before I did). With every passing chapter, I could observe a progressive improvement in Pico's writing style. Essays from Argentina, Paraguay and Bhutan are very interesting. He comes into his own with the concluding essay on Australia."
4,Eight informative chapters,Much better than I thought it would. I really gained insight on the people of these places as well as the places themselves. I now would want to visit some of them. Others never---which is the point.
5,Fascinating Founder Father of America,"This book paints a fascinating picture of William Penn's place in history as a founding father of America. The authors provide poignant narratives that show Penn's enormous contributions to the founding of a new government of freedom based on covenant, implying that Penn should be studied as enthusiastically as Washington, Jefferson, Adams and other early American leaders. The Seed of a Nation also explains why democracy will only work well when practiced by a public that understand the primacy of covenant relationships based on personal integrity, genuine faith, and generous trust. What I especially liked when I read this book is that the authors cut through the boring dogma of religion and academic soliloquy to get to the heart of matters, focusing on how Penn actually treated others, especially native Americans, and how he formed bonds of friendship that still illuminate how political leaders ought to be leading in the 21st century."
4,very well though out,"This book is complicated, but it is worth the time invested in reading it. The chapters are very long though. Although, it is complex it can and should be read by everyone ( i'm 12). The book portrays his life very well and is very informational. This book is not based soley on his Buchenwald experience but on his life after liberation."
4,Peace alluded him,"He made his struggle quite evident but I never felt he appreciated how much he meant to others. He seemed to always be seeking more study, more people but none brought him peace. I was astonished that he told us practically nothing of Marion, his wife. The book was not finished when it ended."
1,Siemens Routers are clunkers,"I own a Siemens router. It worked great for about 6 months and then it died. Siemens did replace it with another, and upgaded it because they apparently admit the other was no good. The new ""improved"" Siemens router worked for a while, now it's print spooling function won't operate properly. I've wasted about three business days with tech support, fussing with the two Siemens routers trying to get them to stay running. I recommend to anyone to avoid Siemens router products."
2,Always needs to be reset,"I've owned one of these for months now, and I have to reset it at least twice a day, every day. All you have to do is reset it and it comes back up and works great, but we have computers in different rooms, and my wife always knows that the first time she wants to use her computer she has to stop in my office and reset the router first, so it has become a habit. It was easy to install, but what a pain! I'm on this site looking for another one because I just can't take it anymore."
5,"Un "" must"" de ce que l'Angleterre fait de mieux.","Ce CD n'a pas pris une ride depuis sa sortie en 1989. Si vous désirez savoir ce qu'est la pop britannique des années 80, son atmosphere étrange et ses mélodies que l'on se surprend a fredonner dans la rue, achetez ce CD. C'est indispensable, a l'heure ou l'on réécoute et réhabilite la musique des eighties.Apres, si ce n'est déja fait, achetez ""Closer"" de Joy Division, ""Violator"" de Depeche Mode et ""The Queen Is Dead"" des Smiths. Bienvenue en adolescence, bienvenue en Grande Bretagne!"
4,Cosmopolitan,"After trying to convince my friends of the genius that was New Order for 2 years, Technique came out, an album i felt paled in comparison to previous efforts, and my friends were instant fans. Certainly this slick new band was not the New Order I had grown to love! Kicking and screaming i went into the future. My friend's exaltations only making me madder, i listened with stuborness to this electronic record with a cool cover.But Peter Hook's bass warmed the ice in my veins. How could I not like the hook of ""All the Way"" even if it sounded like a ""Just Like Heaven"" rip off? ""Fine Time"" remains one of the finest disco tracks they ever made. Complete with the humorous sheep bleats. And ""Run"" is a fine tuning of any number of past New Order tales of love and loss. This time they just put a cosmopolitan bent to it. It took a while for me to grow to love this album but now it's one i can't do without."
1,Yet another DISASTER from TONE-DEAF Rhino,"What the previous reviewers wrote with regards to this mess Rhino issued is 100% correct. Wow! Mastered from vinyl! Are they kidding?! In fact, this seems to be an on-going problem with this once great, now completely tone-deaf label. (They also recently released The Stooges first self-titled album, and it too is an utter disaster. Rhino was utterly asleep as the speed is oh so very s-l-o-w. It's as if no one bothered to listen to what they were releasing or were too stupid to know just how painfully slow it was... point-blank unlistenable).The currently reviewed title (and I am afraid anything that comes from Rhino these days) are must avoids... if nothing else, to let Rhino know they need to actually bother to listen before releasing material as high-priced collector editions."
5,The mask behind the face!!,"This was the previous Op. of this perceptive director- Tony Richardson - before he became a status filmmaker with Tom Jones.The entertainer is one of the golden twenty films of the sixties. Laurence Olivier's virtuosity is quite breathtaking around the character of a tricky louse, unpleasant, third-rate British Hall performer and fatuous man. Through this overwhelming bravura performance gets to show all the shabbiness, pathos, banality of this impostor. Brenda de Vanzie (One of the finest British actress ever born) and a raising promising actor named Albert Finney, conform a superb cast hard to find actually.Intense, mesmerizing and memorable film."
5,An Emotional Roller Coaster... FANTASTIC!!!,"Within the first 15 minutes, you will understand all the characters and where the story is going. With that said, I can now rave about both story and Actors.The simple plot of a die-hard Vaudville-style Performer and the effect he has on his extended family (both up and down the family chain). Falling upon hard times is nothing new to Archie (Sir Laurence). All the sub-plots (and there are many) all center around Archie and he isn't dealing too well with any of them. You can literally watch this bastian of sleaze disintergrate as the people around him suddenly start gaining some importance and self-esteem, perhaps too little and too late.Joan Plowright (then Ms. Oliver) made her debut as Archie's daughter. Albert Finney is in the fantstic cast too. Off screen, this group were playing ""switch-partners,"" which eventually caused a divorce (Oliver & Plowright) and a marriage (Finney & Plowright).Oh what tangled webs we weave..."
3,good in theory,Product was not very useful for me because I bought it to use with my laptop. Unfortunately my laptop cannot convert voltage from 110 to 220 volts. Make sure you are using this product with an electronic device that can convert voltage from 110 to 220 volts.
4,Fun To Build and Play With,I bought this robotic arm to learn more about servos and motion. I already own an OWI-535 Robotic arm which uses a tilt motion at the wrist. This arm has twist motion at the arm. The base will spin freely when carried and that is the only thing I don't like about it.
3,Lots of assembly required,"When I bought this I didn't know it was a ""kit"" and it was pretty amazing. Luckily it is laid out well in the box so if you don't get ahead of yourself you will be able to figure it out. It's certainly educational and fun once you get it adjusted correctly. It's a little pricey too."
3,"It's O.K., but there are better and bigger ones.","I think that this 'authentic' performance doesn't sound too different from most of the 'inauthentic' ones out there. The main difference is that I could better hear the take-and-give within the orchestra. There were a few awkward moments though, and not surprisingly they came when Norrington was trying for more energy and less mystery than we are used to e.g. in the very beginning, or when he was trying for intimacy rather than grandeur e.g. at the very end."
3,Too fast,"While admitting this is a matter of taste, this performance is simply played too fast in all the wrong spots. As ""authentic"" performances go it is slightly better than Hogwood's attempt, and not nearly as good as Gardiner. The strings are thin and some of Norrington's eccentric dynamic readings are extremely unconventional. There are some exciting moments, but as a whole the dramatic nature of the work is not allowed to unfold. If you like authentic performances try Charles Mackerras/Royal Liverpool Philharmonic on EMI or David Zinman/Tonhalle Zurich on Arte Nova. Both are more convincing."
2,Pales next to Gardiner,"I bought this disk ages ago and played it a couple of times. While I liked the sound of period instruments, this recording just sounds terrible. I recently bought the complete Gardiner Beethoven. Wow! Lively, clear and intelligent. Gardiner convinces the listerner that he knows what he is doing (i.e. knows how to make this music) in a way that Norrington can't."
3,Slow movement ruins performance,"Beethoven's 9th is a great piece of music, I cannot imagine anybody arguing that comment. The greatest part of the music, in my opinion, is the slow movement. Most conductors play this movement in about 16 minutes. I like it about 14 so the music moves but still has plenty of expression. Any faster and the music pretty much sounds like a salon piece. That is exactly what Maestro Norrington has done here. His timing is 11 and change, way too fast. The finale lacks power and the chorus and soloists are both second rate. The first two movements are pretty good though, which is why he gets three stars, although2 1/2 is the correct rating. If you are curious about this rather famous recording, try to locate in your local library. I would not waste any money on it. If you want period instruments, buy the Gardiner version. It is much better."
4,Very Good Travel Mystery,"I enjoyed this book very much; it kept my interest and included a good climax. The story revolved around a travel group who took their first trip abroad - England. I have been to many of the places they visited so that was especially enjoyable to read about. This group runs into a few ""issues"" during their two week adventure. Claire, the main character, had to ""keep it together"" for all the travelers in the group and for herself. I just purchased the next in the series ""Washington Weirdos"" for the Kindle."
1,Dull and Stilted,"Based on the great reviews, I purchased this book for my Kindle. Normally, I finish books in a day or so, but this one was so boring, it took nearly a week. I had to force myself to finish it so I could move on to something good. I found the characters, including heroine Claire Gulliver, incredibly dull. The dialogue was painfully stiff and unnatural. With so many characters on the tour to England, I was amazed at the lack of variation in speaking style. The mystery here is pretty dull too and I found the resolution unsatisfying. I'm a huge Agatha Christie fan and enjoy cozies, period mysteries and contemporary mysteries, but wouldn't recommend this book to anyone unless they're suffering from insomnia."
2,T is for terrible!,"I am still slogging along in this dreadful story(84%). I would really like to like it because the settings,the sf bay area and GB are my top favorites, but boy oh boy is the writing flat and the plotting predictable. One reviewer mentioned some incorrectly used words, I have only found two so far and in fact that search is kinda what keeps me going. The funniest misuse was the word ""thong"" when the author was obviously referring to a ""throng"" at the airport. Anyway aim really glad I only paid the relatively low kindle price for this poor piece of writing. It does not even work for my insomnia because it is irritating, not just boringP.s. Just came upon this sterling example of literary styling .""The door opened on to a functional bathroom."" there must be a better adjective for this sentence, like spatious, elegant, cramped, well appointed, grimy, but ""functional""?"
1,Tea is for Terror,"Horrible book. How did this get published? How did it get on Amazon? Two words for the author: Editing. Transitions. Neither exists in this book. Doesn't deserve even one star. The author writes in her introduction about fulfilling dreams and I do admire people who jump into the fray to try something new and scary. I'm not a mean person, but I do believe when others purchase a product they should get their money's worth. Not here. There may be potential with this series but the author really, really needs to sharpen her pencil, edit, create proper transitions between paragraphs and topic changes and learn to use a dictionary! I bought the kindle edition for $3.99. Thank goodness I didn't spend nearly $20 for the softcover edition. I would be raving mad. As it is, I'm just disappointed in the publishing world and Amazon for allowing such a poor book out the door."
5,Best musical surprise of this year,"I heard about Céu when one of my friends on last.fm made me a recommendation. I think it's the best album I got this year.It's a well balanced fusion of vocal jazz, regae, afro, funky, samba, Miles Davis and electronic chill out music. Really a good job.Ceu reminds me in some way the first album of Norah Jones where you like every song. This is the same.I'm impatient waiting for her second album."
1,Does not play on my computer,Great music.I am pleased with the sound. Unfortunately it does not play on my computer so I can't take it along with me on my Ipod or even play it while I'm working. I returned it once because I thought it was defective. They exchanged it quickly with no improvement. I'm considering returning it even though it is great music.
5,Mellow,"Ceu has a mellow, relaxing voice. The album has lots of modern rhythms, as well as traditional Brazilian beats. A great CD to pop in after a hectic day at work."
4,Fun music you must have.,"A fresh, beautiful! voice. Not your typical traditional Bossa Nova, more in the style of Paula Santoro, kind of jazzy and pop."
4,Well done,"While I prefer small-scale modern-instrument performances, this is probably the best of the allegedly-historical instrument recordings. Parrott's conducting is quite good, the chorus and orch do well. Soprano Emma Kirkby is distinctive and particularly fine, although not quite up to the level of Lynne Dawson with Christophers.This one belongs in everyone's Messiah collection."
5,Value!,Love these bibs. Like many I am a Mom on a budget and these are a great deal. These are perfect for my 5 month old. He drools a lot and these soak it up. Also a nice size for feeding.
3,cotto but not water proof,"these bib are made with cotton, it feels good. The only problem is not waterproof, so I have to change very frequently cause my baby is drooling to much."
3,"Ok, but not great","The colors we received were different from the picture - and I liked those in the picture more. No big deal, but still.The bibs soak through rather quickly (my 4-month old son drools a lot) - be prepared to change them very frequently.Good things: the bibs are broad and large (good coverage) and the velcro holds very well and is comfortable to wear."
4,not as good as frenchie but good,2nd favorite bibs only second to Frenchie. Not for newborns at 2 months she can wear them well.
1,DONT BUY WHAT YOU CANNOT SEE & TOUCH,"bEAUTIFUL COLORS BUT THEY ARE THIN, THE SIZE WAS FINE. IF YOU HAVE SERIOUS DROOLER, YOU COULD USE ALL 10 IN A MATTER 3/4 HOURS."
2,"Nice size, but very thin","These bibs are a good size width and length and they have a large neck opening, so they fit a toddler pretty well. But they are VERY thin, two-ply very thin terry. My 10 month old drools constantly and he will soak through these bibs in less than an hour. The shape of the velcro rough and soft sides do not match, so you have to be careful how you fasten it to make sure the rough side doesn't touch baby's neck. And be sure to fasten it before the wash so they don't eat your other clothes. They are bright pretty colors and they don't fade or shrink in the wash.Bottom line: I wouldn't buy these again as they are too thin for my drooler."
3,"Large bibs, but NOT waterproof, will soak through immediately","Okay, so I was looking for bibs that covered a large area but also ones that wouldn't leave the clothes under the bibs wet. These were NOT the ones I should have bought. Sure, they're cheap at $1 per bib. They work fine to catch food messes, but they are not good if you want to catch the baby's drool. It holds almost no water at all. At the first sign of the bibs being wet, you can most certainly expect the shirt under the bib to be wet already. Depending on what you're looking for, these may or may not be for you."
2,Too thin,"Although these bibs are large in size, they are way too thin. When my 3-1/2 month old drools or spits up the moisture goes straight through to his clothes and they end up wet anyway. Also the neck size is large and is too big for him. I ordered the green sprouts waterproof pack of 10 bibs and they are well worth the extra $. They are waterproof, fit his neck perfectly and are also large enough to catch his drool and spit ups."
1,Total garbage!,"These bibs started falling apart after ONE wash! Pathetic. The velcro on all of them unraveled and now the tabs are falling off. Plus the velcro tab is really small so they don't adjust much, making a gap between my baby's neck and the bib so her clothing gets dirty anyway. Seriously, if you want throw away bibs, these are for you. If you want something that is going to last, look elsewhere."
3,Bibs,"These bibs were very affordable and look nice. However, I was looking for something thicker....my son slobbers and spits up a lot, but I'm not a huge fan of the water proof bibs. Overall these bibs will work great when I'm feeding him, but they aren't designed for all day usage."
3,Waaay too big,This seem like they would work but only for a 2-3 year old child. I have a 4 month old and they are way too huge. These bibs practically cover her whole body. I can't really use them now so I will keep them and maybe try and use them once she grows a bit.
3,"Good size, wash well, feel soft, but kinda thin.",These bibs are ok. They're a good size for my lil chunky monkeys (4 months old). They need to be changed more frequently than I would have liked since they're kind of thin.
1,Nile Rodgers should have changed his name to Alan Smithee...,"...because it's hard to believe that he'd want his name associated with such a crappy album. This album, produced by Rodgers, is just hard to like, period. I've tried listening several times, but its overly trite mix of R&B and hip-hop just won't grow on me (and I usually tend to like that kind of music). Depthless and immature lyrics abound, the beats are probably the most stale and uninspiring that you'll ever hear on a Nile Rodgers-produced album, and that suit she's wearing is scary. Even Sheena Easton's NR-produced album, which is much more pop than R&B/hip-hop, is much better than this."
4,Melt in Your Mouth Delicious!,"""Bounty"" bars consist of a soft, almost molten center of sweet coconut coated in an outer layer of milk chocolate. You can easily buy them ""over the counter"" here in Australia. But if that's not the case where you are, and you don't mind a diet rich in junk food, then yes, this is a candy bar worth going to the trouble of ordering over the internet.Note that here on Amazon you can purchase bounty bars in boxes with varying numbers of bars inside, so it is worth your while to crunch the numbers and think about what package offers the best value for you. At the same time, it may not be entirely in the best interests of your health to have _too_ many of these things lying around at home all at once!Theo."
4,Yum!,I would have given it a fifth star if they were a little bit bigger bars! Very creamy and delicious!
1,Cacaphanous Garbage,"I purchased this CD, because I thought it would be similar to the haunting, flowing jazz melodies of Bruce Fowler's ""Entropy."" Not even close. Nothing but cacaphony on two tubas. It sounds like two 10-year-olds who discovered a couple of tubas, and started blowing into them just for the heck of it.I guess this CD is considered ""rare"" these days, because the prices being charged are exhorbitant. I paid $29.98 for mine. When it arrived, I noticed two price stickers on it. One was $15.98, and a second had it marked down to $13.98. However, the seller evidently wanted to make a quick buck and jacked the price up another $16.00.Total waste of money. I sold my copy to our local used CD shop for one dollar. They probably just lost a dollar, because I doubt anyone will ever buy it."
3,Good for the Price,"The product's quality was very lacking but the price is not bad, i would recommend spending $5 to $10 more for a much better product as this one only lasted a few months."
1,It broke within 2 months.,I bought this car charger on April 5th and used it normally in the car every couple days. It's June 17th and it already broke. What a piece of junk.
2,Need practical examples.,"About theory, the book is good, but; it needs more practical or numerical examples, in order to get the information understandable.There are too many concepts and ideas that without a good example, it is very hard to assimilate.Also the computer oriented experiments in matlab, do not use theneural network tool box, so it is not possible to get the gap to convert knowledge into computer code.If these two recommendations are improved in a next edition, the book will become and excellent one.thanks,"
5,Theoretically Great,"I found this book to be an excellent ""research"" reference. It's mathematical presentation is rigorous and provides good (up-to-date)theoretical foundation for the experienced scientist/engineer. Saying this, it is not a good book for the beginner especially when one only wants to know the general physical meaning of neural networks and where it is best applied."
2,Not that good,"Considering all the other clearly written and mathematically complete books on neural network theory you should not waste your time with this one. For feedforward nets try bishop's book, which, though mathematically more difficult, gives real insight into the complex behavior of these types of nets. Rock on."
1,shabby seller,"I was expecting to see a book in good to very good condition. It turned out to be a used, chinese edition, with cutouts on pages. Looks unprofessional. The pages feel like they'll tear anytime."
5,This book goes above and beyond,"Great Book! I have been using ColdFusion for 3 years, and read many ColdFusion books. Every book I've come across simply tells you ""how"" to do stuff. I can only learn how to do a <CFOUTPUT> so many times. However, Optimizing ColdFusion takes a different approach - it takes what I already know, and shows me how to do it well. This is the first CF book I have read that covers the core development obstacles that we as ColdFusion developers and designers struggle with on a daily basis. Not only does this book analyze trouble areas, but it also shows how to improve upon application design, coding, and even some troubleshooting. I also liked that this book brushed on the Fusebox methodology, and discussed how Spectra impacted enterprise ColdFusion development. The information is this book seems to define the distinction between ColdFusion developers and ColdFusion gurus. I would definitely recommend this book to other ColdFusion users."
5,Interesting!,"100 and Healthy is a book that should be read by anyone who is interested in improving and maintaining their quality of life. As someone entering middle age, I have many concerns about my health. This book provides an easy-to-understand description of plant medicines and how they can help us improve our quality of life. The research is documented with over 850 references. Once I started reading, I couldn't put it down!"
5,Awesome information to stay Healthy,Awesome book with references and resources given. Very easy to read for the average person. I could not put the book down until I was done and still read parts from time to time.
4,Anchor Mate,I had one on a boat of mine at least 20 years ago. This one works great. We will see how long it lasts in a salt water environment.
3,Very good generic performance!?!,"The only thing I have to say about this recording is: if you can get it cheap- get it. It's 2 cd's of the most generic singing in the world but if you are a begginer it might be just the thing. The only good things about these cd's are the nice hightlights from: Don Giovanni, Figaro and Zauberflote. The best singers are in the Don G highlights so start with those. If you are a seasoned, particular Opera listener DOOOOOOOONT get this unless you can get it cheap (and i mean dirt cheap)"
1,Highly Displeased,"This is maybe the worst item that I have ever purchased in my life. The size is totally wrong. Sock, no maybe a half of a sock may fit on the press. I am totally displeased. Ad totally misleading!!!!!! I would rate this product 0!!!!!!"
1,Oops Wrong decision,I bought this to save time. It took me longer to stem press one shirt then ironing by conventional iron. It was too small. I end up returing it which cost me @$25 in shipping cost both ways.
1,Duped!,"Please take this horrible misrepsentation off of your web site, or at the very least practice honesty in advertising. This unit is so small that all it good for is ties, shorts and socks. I feel violated by Amazon and Conair."
1,Not at all a good press,"I purchase this press, and was totally disappointed with this product. It takes longer to press a shirt with this so called press, than with an iron. I will be returning."
1,What I recieved was the Conair FSP5 Don't waste your money,"I thought I was getting a different fabric press than what came. The reviews for the conair FSP5 that I read are totally accurate. Don't buy this, you will be disappointed. It is too small to even put a shirt sleeve on.I am sending it back. As I write this I see what is listed is not what I got. Buyer be ware. This press isn't as wide as an ironing board."
2,Conair 70 large Table Top Steam Press,"Very disappointed. It is definitely not large, at least not in my opinion. I will probably give it to one of my kids because they don't iron often. They might be able to use this."
1,pass this one.,"This book could be characterized as a list of attached examples, or a collection of notes. It is difficult to follow and is not thorough. Rather than explaining concepts, the authors give examples, one per chapter. Furthermore, most of the material is repeated in each chapter since they apply to all the examples. This is a book made in a hurry by a compilation of the authors' notes. My major interest was in AMT implications, which were ignored. After trying to read it for 2 days it went to a corner of my bookcase."
5,my adult leather ballet slippers,I am very happy with my slippers .They were just what I expected and the customer service from National was very good.I will order from National again.
3,The second novel by Josephine Leslie isn't as good as her first,"Josephine leslie wrote ""The Ghost and Mrs. Muir"" in 1947 (Using R.A. Dick) and it became a well received movie and a television series. Unfortunately her second and last novel written in 1974 is not as good as her first. Rather than communicating with a ghost, the heroine hears a voice in her head that turns out to be the voice of the devil. She refuses to make a deal with him for her soul, but he still grants her immortality. Nothing to shout out about."
2,Strange Bedfellows,"Okay. The first book, Family Curse, was just too strange. I couldn't understand it. So I gave the author the benefit of the doubt and thought maybe this one would be better. NOT! The author has one more chance to get it right. Three strikes you're out! Hint: Try writing mainstream romance novels (like BET Books). I think she'll do well in that genre."
1,Confused and confusing,"I am what's called a ""Senior Engineer"", I regularly have to read and make sense of very technical and obscure material. I have now been through this book three times slowly, and can not make sense of it. It seems to restate the contents of the manual but has not organized it in a way that helps me to make a connection between the functions of the cameras and the flash unit and their various combinations of possible settings.Maybe the publisher pushed him to get it done in an unreasonably short period of time.There are a few helpfull comments on the general subject of flash photography."
1,I've been waiting for this book forever. I'm upset.,"First, the book was supposed to be ready by March. Then, all through April it was still supposed to be ready by March. Now it's May, and the ad says ""June 30th."" I wouldn't trust that if I were you. The sad thing is, this book is really necessary."
1,Nikon SB28 from Magic Latern Guides,I will agree with the fellow reviewers on this book. Magic Lantern and Michael Huber must have been on vacation while writing this book. the book is called Nikon SB28 not Sb24 or SB25. This book does not tell you anything that is really needed to use and or understand this flash unit. The Nikon owners manual is the one to use!
1,Poor Exposure of the SB-28 Speedlight,"...I decided to buy this book. After all, the other Magic Lantern books were so well written and informative, I reasoned.I reasoned wrong! The writer clearly understands the many technical details of the SB-28, but utterly fails to communicate his knowledge in any remotely understandable way.A fine effort wasted, I'm afraid."
1,Lonesome River,"This books is part of a trilogy, so be sure to get Dream River and River of Tomorrow. If you like Dorothy Garlock I would recommend these books."
5,Great melodic hardrock,"Great melodic hardrock, sounds very much like Saraya but with a more powerful voice! Teresa Straley kicks everyones asses, sings with power and its the famous Tommy Thayer on guitars. A must have CD!!"
3,Anecdotal and Scientific,"In The Naturalist in La Plata, Hudson does a good job of blending scientific content with interesting stories, anecdotes, and other tidbits from his observations of the area. Hudson grew up in the Pampas, and the book illustrates his special affinity for the region. Additionally, he has a love for nature and a respect for its wonders. An early environmentalist, Hudson often laments man's destruction of nature in this volume, presenting wonderful arguments as to the value of convservation. I probably wouldn't recommend this as an easy leisure read, but it is a good example of naturalist writing. Hudson's stories and obvious admiration of nature keep the book from being too dry."
5,How to get the most use out of the least water,"Amy Vicker's Handbook Of Water Use And Conversation is a vast, scholarly, yet eminently practical guide and reference work enabling the reader to skillfully get the most use out of the least water, whether one is attempting to conserve for one's home, business, industry, or farm. Black-and-what photographs and diagrams illustrate the many topics discussed herein, from optimal plumbing adapters to legal and economic incentives for water conservation. The Handbook Of Water Use And Conservation is enthusiastically recommended for anyone with environmental concerns for water quality and usage, from lay homeowners, to agriculturalists, to municipal authorities, to corporate C.E.O.'s."
5,incredible depth and breadth of information,"As a resource policy professional who spent four years exploring the state of the art of water efficiency technologies and programs, I am blown away by the depth and breadth of information in this text. Recycle the pile of guides and reports that have built up over the years, lay off your staffer who is researching what other groups are doing, and let that expert water consultant stay home for a couple of extra days. Just read Vickers' book.Andrew Jones, Project Director,Sustainability Institute"
4,Lives up to title,"The Wine Tasting Party Kit was a real hit and included six reusable cloth bags to hide the wine bottles, rating sheets, and wine glass stem labels. The enclosed book is very basic but can provide a jumping off point to select a theme for your party. A good investment if you want to have a series of parties with your friends."
4,Very Fun,"This kit is perfect for beginners. I didn't have a clue of how to get started in planning a party and this kit took the guess work out of EVERYTHING. However, it is very interactive and I reccomend keeping your guest list small (4-5 people/4-5 bottles)."
5,Excellent Book,"Using Chinese rock and roll, soap operas, books, comics, films, and karaoke, the Party's heroes and ideas are merchandised to the comrade in the street. China abounds in subteties and ironies.Barme's analysis is well written and very relevant."
1,WARNING--This is the exact same flipper disc as earlier release,This new blu-ray release is exactly like the last one: a flipper disc with scratches on the dvd side. Case contains only one disc which is identical to the previous release.
1,Out of Africa,"Bad Audio. Could not hear the dialog. Tried to contact Amazon, but no-way concerning instant videos. Tried to dispute the $3 visa payment, but amount too low."
4,Out of Africa Movie,"Not my kind of movie, but I love Meryl Streep. Excellent scenery of Africa in HD. The movie came on time and in perfect condition."
3,Lovely Movie - This Version Missing Scenes,"This ""Collectors Edition"" has Highs and Lows. The High being a beautiful transfer, with clarity and wonderful warm colors; really a lovely thing to watch. The Low (and this is critical to me) this version has a significant number of scenes that were included on the Network TV showing, that are completely missing from this version. I wish I had known this before purchasing this DVD. I assumed the ""Collectors Edition"" would have the many little touching scenes that show the developing relationships between Karen and Farah, Denys, etc...that really made this movie. The little scenes between Karen and Farah when he tells her the rains can come any time now - When Farah gets her a Somali Servant to carry her rifles - and others. These missing scenes have made me go back to my taped copy from TV. Very sad this is not a complete version."
3,out of africe,"did not hold my interest like I anticipated to me it was an ""all right"" moviebut I surely have seen many many I liked better But on the other hand myhusband thought the movie was outstanding and is going to watch it again.There you have two different opinions so take it anyway you want ""Like or No Like"""
1,I wanted a video to use at home and unknowingly got a REGION 2,"I am very very disappointed because this video is from REGION 2.... which means I can't use it!!!I certainly wish ""REGION 2"" would have been made clear to me when I was choosing it.I wish I could send it back and get a copy that is US player friendly!!!"
1,"Be sure to check the ""region"" for your dvd!","If you're going to purchase a dvd online, be sure to check carefully that it will play in the US. I purchased one but simply assumed that it would play here. Instead, it only plays in region 2, which, I believe, includes England. At this point easier simply to throw away than to go through the trouble of returning and trying to get refund."
1,bad dvd,I love this movie and bought this dvd. The DVD side skips every time at a certain spot in the movie to the end. The blue ray side will not play at all. I must have gotten a dud.
5,The Best,This is one of the best films of the modern era. The preformances by the entire cast is superlative. The script is everything that a great script should be. The photography is some of the best in film history. In short-one of the greatest films ever made.
5,One of the best movies of all time.,A must have for your movei collection. An unforgettable love story with stunning performances by Meryl Streep and Robert Redford. Breathtaking scenery of Africa. Captivating!
5,"Extrodinary story, acting and production",The movie has always been a favorite for me. I have owned several copies and given most of them away. The principles and supporting actors present their parts in ways that convey the real life of people an unusually type of life
2,T-o-o-o-o Long!,"If it weren't for the beautiful scenery, I would have stopped watching. The plot was not strong enough to support the length of the movie. Too much detail and not enough storyline. At the conclusion, I was left with the question, ""What was that about?"". Overall, I didn't particularly enjoy this movie."
2,Poor sound quality,Could hardly hear when they spoke but when the music plays it would get really loud. Picture quality was very good just the sound was very poor.
5,Great Movie,Great movie and fast service once it was ordered and reasonable price. Easy to order and track my order once completed.
5,One of my favorites,"I have loved this movie since the first time I watched it. It would've been nice if Robert Redford could've at least tried to sound like the nationality he portrayed (and I can't remember which one it was). So apart from him sounding totally American in this movie of many accents, it was masterful, moving, and musical. One of my favorites."
5,Out of Africa,"Not only did I receive what was ordered, the movie was well worth the short wait to receive it. I would recommend this movie to anyone."
5,A classic!,"One of the all-time best movies!...gorgeous sound track, gorgeous scenery..beautiful story beautifully narrated..top cast. I own it and view it repeatedly."
5,Breaks but strengthens your heart,"What doesn't kill us makes us stronger... The tale of Karen Blixen is enhanced with a beautiful performance by Meryl Streep. Streep's work on language is magnificent in and of itself; I could watch this film again and again just to hear her say, ""I had a farm... out of Africa."" This movie is deep and rich in the best sense, with tremendous cinematography, a great soundtrack, Oscar-quality performances, and a great story to be told."
2,Out of Africa DVD,"The story line was great, that's why I bought it, but the quality of the DVD was poor at best. I had to turn the volume all the way up to barely hear it and it had a glitch right in the middle that I have to skip through.Very poor quality!!!"
4,Good,"This is a long, slow-paced movie, that if you're in the mood for, is quite worth watching. It's beautifully shot, and the acting (especially by the Africans, many of whom never acted before!) is quite good (except for Redford! I'm a Redford fan, but his acting in this movie is very awkward. He's always twitching his elbows, and awkwardly deliverying his lines. He originally had a British accent down, to play Dennis as the Brit he was. But at the last minute the director told Redford to speak American, for the American audience. Maybe that's why his acting is so flacid in this movie, because he had to shift gears just before the actually shooting. Okay, I know some people who worked on the movie, that's how I know this.) But overall, this is rich, and moving, but the book is better."
2,What a dud...,"Sorry, I know I am in the minority for this film but it just didn't make me think romantic and I didn't like the story. Why do we need to celebrate these particular people when there are much more romantic true stories? The acting was fine and there were some funny moments but for the most part it was not up to a good standard for me."
3,Poor Clarity,"This Blue-ray/DVD does not measure up to all the 25rh Anniversary hype. Film clarity is inconsistent: Some close-up scenes are blotchy and facial features are difficult to discern. And there are more than a few episodes in the film where the cinematography looks washed out.I watched the DVD side of the double disc and wonder if the poor quality is due to the piggy-back recording of Blue-ray/DVD.Sadly,I gave away my original version of ""Out of Africa,"" which, I think, is a better all-around video."
5,"A beautiful, mature film","I found this movie to be very enjoyable--one of my favorites along with ""The English Patient"" for example. The cinematography is breathtaking and the airplane ride scene is very emotional and one of the great scenes in film history I believe.When people wonder why they don't make movies like this anymore the answer is very simple: Julia Roberts and Jennifer Anniston are not Meryl Streep. She is, as usual, superb. Unlike some other reviewers I enjoyed Robert Redford's performance. I'll grant that he did not come across as an Englishmen, but he did pull off the romantic, masculine, self-centered part of the role quite well.Finally, this movie is not for the American Pie/Pretty Woman crowd. They will be bored. And can someone please tell me how this movie did not make the AFI's 100 geatest films of all time?!! It's not better than E.T.? or Fargo? or Forrest Gump? You've got to be kidding me!!!"
1,Double Sided Disks Are Evil,"Universal, for some reason, has elected to continue to produce these double sided disks that contains the Blu-ray movie on one side and the DVD on the flip-side. Why is it that Universal cannot follow in Disney's lead and release these movies as two disk sets. Disney has combo disks that contains the Blu ray and DVD version in the same release, but the DVD and Blu ray disks are on separate disks, utilizing single sided disks.I seriously do NOT recommend this item for purchase."
1,"Remastered Blu-Ray of ""Out of Africa"" Coming in 2012","I agree with earlier posters that the Blu-Ray of ""Out of Africa"" released in 2010 was a major disappointment in terms of picture quality (my one star rating applies to the quality of the Blu-Ray and not to the film itself). Apparently NBC/Universal heard the complaints and agreed---according to The Digital Bits website, a remastered Blu-Ray of ""Out of Africa"" will be released in March 2012."
5,Meryl Streep's Finest Film,"This love story brought to film will delight many teenage and adult viewers. It is fantastically beautiful! Winner of many awards, little money was spared in filming it. The landscape of Africa is photographed as it appeared in the early 1900's. The viewer is taken into the world of luxury and privilege, and also heartache and pain. Meryl Streep moves with grace through the various scenes, with Robert Redford playing his usual dapper character. The contrast between the wealth of the white settlers and the poverty of the black Africans is accurately depicted. One comes away from the movie with a better understanding of a society in Africa that existed at one time, but fortunately has evolved into a more equal union."
5,Classic Movie,I chose this DVD to replace a tape that had deteriorated. It is a classic that can be viewed repeatedly with enjoyment!My purchase was delivered promptly and was just as described for a good price.
4,Still great after all these years,"I watched this recently for the first time since 1985 and was surprised how well it's held up. The photography is the first thing you notice. Then, Meryl Streep's performance. Redford is just ok as the commitment-phobic safari-mad Brit whom Karen Blixen falls for. He hasn't changed much since then, at least on screen. This was big, old-fashioned movie-making by the late Sydney Pollack, and it's still well worth watching. It's a bit less than PC by today's standards in its treatment of the ""natives,"" however."
5,So good,"I remember going to see this in the theater. It is still a vivid love story - between her and Africa, as well as her and Denis."
1,poor quality,dvd skips chapters....cannot even back up to view them!! excellent movie...i own it on vhs......BAD dvd!
1,"Mannered, overlong, pompous","Unspeakable. One of the worst movies ever to win an Oscar for Best Picture. It has all the earmarks of Quality Cinema: foreign accents, Meryl Streep, foreign locales, a doomed romance, excruciating tedium, and a three-hour running time. What it does not have is an interesting script, interesting direction, or really anything of interest or value. Only Klaus Maria Brandauer emerges from this ponderous disaster unscathed. He delivers a performance of wit and dexterity, and leaves one praying for his appearance onscreen. See it for him, and feel free to Fast-Forward between his scenes."
1,I cant review this item,"How can I rate something when after a month I still havent received it. I send the seller an email, and I still have yet to hear back from them."
1,What?????,"Here is what I got from the movie:The lead character, Karen, cant marry her true love (at the time), so she settles for his brother who she doesn't love and he certainly doesn't love her. They move to Africa, Karen wants kids but can't have them because of her lovely husband. He cheats on her, and then she cheats on him. After this it all becomes a blur until the end where her lover (who refused to marry her after she divoced) has a tragic ordeal, and they try to make me feel sorry for him??? He was a jerk, her husband was a jerk, and this movie dragged on FOREVER until it you finally got to horrable ending. Why can't I give it 0 stars.....?"
5,"Interesting plot, Georgeous Scenery, Fantastic Music","I like the story. The performances are wonderful. But the music, it's worth the price of the film twice over. Absolutely magnificent.We've watched it many times on Beta and are now ordering it in VHS format."
2,25th anniversary blu-ray is not a good copy,This review is for the 25th anniversary blu-ray/dvd combo. I give it two stars because several times on the blu-ray the voice track falls out of sync with the action on the screen. Very annoying. DVD side didn't do this.
4,Great Chick Flick,"Even though I had seen this movie a long time ago, it was great watching it again. The scenery and music are wonderful, and Redford and Streep were great cast for those parts. A sad love story. SW"
1,DVD didnt work,The film was very blurry and impossible to watch. I didnt care to get a refund since it was so cheap.
3,Very good cinematic experience,"Enjoyed the storyline and it had a strong cast; just not as enticing as other movies of the same genre that I have scene. Still recommend viewing it as 3 and above are ""worth seeing"" from my perspective. Very good use of 1.5 - 2 hours."
5,Epic Movie and Superb Actors/Actresses,"This was a fantastic movie. If you've never seen it, it is a must see movie. One of Meryl Streep's best movies of her career. Her acting skills were at her best along with Robert Redford. If you are unsure about this movie then look at clips of this movie on youtube.com"
3,Out of ideas,"A big, lavish, expensive, overly long disappointment. Based on Isak Dinesen's writings about her life as a coffee plantation owner in Africa, Meryl Streep plays the character based on her; she is married to a German baron who cares only for booze and other women. She meets and falls in love with Robert Redford, who is a big game hunter - the totally independent kind. Most of the movie is about Streep overseeing her plantation (boring to her and us) and pining for Redford, who shows up ocasionally. It's about 30 minutes of story and 120 minutes of pretty African scenery. Not a memorable movie."
5,My favoriate movie of all time!!!,"I love this movie. It has a little something for everyone ( music, scenes, dialogue, romance, struggle, etc..). I'd recommend this movie to anyone with a romantic heart.TM Brown, author of ""A Life Not My Own"" ."
4,Classic Movie,Such a wonderful love story and good background music. Wanted to have this in my classics' library to watch every so often
5,"Salma at her best! I want to marry Salma Hayek, por favor.","Wow, an amazing performance by he lovely and talented Salma Hayek. The movie is wonderfully directed and the plot is magnificent. America needs to open its eyes and explore more great foreign films like this one by director Anotonio Cuadri."
5,LAUGH AGAIN by Charles R. Swindoll,"I would like to offer the following review of Charles Swindoll's book ""Laugh Again"".The book is very inspiring for any reader. Mr. Swindoll explains that past memories haunt our minds. This book addresses that problem and helps people to begin to LAUGH AGAIN!Terrific Book!"
5,"Pleeeeeease, Don't Take Yourself So Seriously!","Swindoll has written an excellent book encouraging the reader to not take him/herself so seriously that all joy is gone from life.The book is a refreshing change from the excellent and decidedly more serious titles Swindoll has written in the past.Each of the 14 chapters contains biblical admonitions to not be so stressed out on life and to realize the joy you can have in Jesus Christ. While life has challenges, Swindoll encourages us to not look like we have been sucking lemons or tasting vinegar all day!Read and be encouraged to learn to just chill every so often!"
2,ok,This is a fairly good way to entertain one's self and spend some time working on self-improvement. I can see anyone reading this book and am recommending it to anyone.
2,Celtic Thunder The Light of Other Days,Older version of current group. They are not up to the current group's standards. I was disappointed but if you like the older versions of celtic music you should like this.
4,Celtic Thunder CD - Light of Other Days,"This CD is from the original Celtic Thunder group. It contains some authentic Celtic songs and if Celtic music is something you enjoy, you will probably like this CD. I would recommend this CD."
3,Same Name Different Group!,"A different Celtic Thunder! I While this is a great collection of I rish songs, it was not the Celtic Thunder I thought I was ordering. This is a different group. It is not Damian McGinty, Keith Harkin, Ryan Kelly, Paul Byrom, and George Donaldson."
4,Celtic Thunder,"I had no idea there were two groups named ""Celtic Thunder"" and, for that reason, was a bit disappointed in this CD. Some of the songs were really good, others were downright depressing. It certainly wasn't the worst CD I ever bought; but definitely not the best, either. I will listen to it again, but have my finger at the ready to skip one or two of the songs."
2,The Light of Other Days--Celtic Thunder,"While this CD is good, it is not nearly as good as the others that they have out. It istoo slow and melancholy in my opinion. I still love Celtic Thunder though."
1,beware,"before you buy be aware this is not the same Celtic Thunder as the 2008 group. Their CD and DVD is delightful. This 1988group, while interesting is rather old fashioned and amateurish sounding. It has that sound of The Early Elvis Recordings. You may like it and it is Irish music.Just a caution so you (unlike me ) know what you are buying"
2,not the same celtic thunder,I was disappointed to find out that there was more than one group called Celtic Thunder and this was not the group I had expected.
1,Not so great.,"Purchased this CD thinking it was an older one from the Celtic Thunder group consisting of 5 men, recently airing on our PBS stations here. Ad on Amazon unclear as to the singers, etc. so I went for it. It sounds like an old '78, tinny and WWII era sounds. I threw it away."
2,confused!!!!!,"I also bought thinking i'm getting a new dvd by Celtic Thunder Heritage ,""which is how I think of them now.Maybe Sharon should think about my add-on,it would stop people like myself who are not aware that we have two groups with the same name.I am so hooked on the guys and the people who make up their shows,band,plus everything they present I was so upset I sent the dvd back unopened after I discovered what the cd contained.To me the two groups are worlds apart."
1,Un-useable!,"I got this player for christmas and the first thing I did was transfer my favorite songs off of some of my CDs but when I started trying to find music to download, well, I couldn't. The player dosen't support DRM files and all music has it! No Im not stupid, we have a computer programmer in the family who looked high and low for non-DRM files and the only place you can get them is CDs"
3,Get a free iPod nano instead!,"Why settle for less, when you can get a brand new original iPod nano 4GB for Free! I got mine from this web site: http://dusturl.com/ve"
5,As good as it gets...,Really a top notch book on op-amps and almost anything you'd ever do with them. Has math where it's needed and rules of thumb where it isn't. Actually is just a great analog design book altogether. Really the definative text on the subject of designing with op-amps.
3,The Gutenberg Bible,"The Gutenberg Bible was most instructive in a sense; however, it did not provide an English version of the Bible itself."
4,An Audio Snapshot,This is the first Blondie album I ever bought and I enjoy it for its ability to evoke an era and a scene that must have been amazing to be a part of. My recollection is hazy considering I was like 7 at the time but walking around NYC with this cd on is a pretty cool experience.
5,An Excellent Representation Of New Wave,"This is New Wave Music at its absolute finest. This raw edgy rock n roll and smooth slippery dance music. And the beat laid down by the drummer is just extrodinary. Deborah Harry's voice works well giving us shades of light and dark. And the band just presses all the right buttons on this 12 track masterpeice. I grew up up on seventies music and therefore I tend to prefer that era the best. However, with the many great records that came out during that time period, this one would rank in my top 25."
4,Blondie is cool.,"Blondie is a pretty cool singer.She made music popular back in the 70's and 80's.I like the way she sings.Although I did not like all of her songs,I would still reccomend her.For she is apart of American music history"
1,RIP OFF,"Although the album itself is great, the packaging and extras are not worth purchasing this again. Worthless."
4,Very good from beginning to end,"I already had a Blondie compilation and ""No exit"" (I'm not sure I was right when I bought this one...) and as Parallel Lines is widely seen as Blondie's best, well, I bought it ! And I don't regret it. There's no really weak songs, even the ones without fantastic melodies have got what it takes to ""hook"" you. Hanging over the telephone, Sunday girl, Picture this, Heart of glass, 11:59, Just go away... This album is a ""best of""! Don't buy ""No exit"" and buy this one instead !"
4,The best Blondie album,"While the lyrics are generally poor, the band can play. This is an exciting and energetic collection of guitar rockers, almost a sort of new wave British invasion style from New York. ""Hanging On the Telephone"" ""11:59"" and ""Sunday Girl"" stand out for me in particular, and the guitar/keyboard solo in ""Just Go Away"" is a sublime pop moment. Very good fun, highly recommended."
5,Classic new wave power pop-punk,"With its irresistible mixture of candy-coated 60s pop sensibilities, new wave cynicism, and the raw aggression of punk, Parallel Lines is one of the great albums of the late 70s. Its 12 songs are as fun and ferocious as anything the Ramones ever recorded, with a kind of snarl and bite that approaches Elvis Costello's. Songs like ""Just Go Away"" and ""Picture This"" fuse bouncing, relentless melodies with snidely poetic lyrics, while ""Pretty Baby"" is nothing short of gorgeous, candy coated power pop. ""One Way Or Another"" has a wonderfully relentless, urgent drive, and ""Sunday Girl"" features a hypnotic wisp of melody. There are a few more slightly experimental tunes, such as the icy, ethereal ""Fade Away And Radiate,"" or the eternally danceable disco-punk-glam of ""Heart Of Glass."" All in all, this is a fantastic album, easily one of the best of the whole punk movement."
3,Disappointing,"I was very excited about seeing a 30th anniversary release of this landmark album, but was disappointed to see that it still contains the boring disco version instead of the original version of ""Heart Of Glass"". I would've rather seen the original version and the disco version as a bonus track of Heart Of Glass like it was done on the Gold Disc released in '94, which I'm lucky to own.I loved the alternate shots of the Parallel Lines photo sessions, wish they had included more though, and wish they had included lyrics, more liner notes, and better packaging, after all this is supposed to be a ""Deluxe Edition""?The DVD is nice, but should've included more video footage, it falls short."
5,"Can you spell ""Classic""","This album is ""Damn"" good! If you're on a desert island you would crave a tall glass of cold water - This is that glass! Drink it up!"
2,50 bucks? Is this a joke!!!???,"This was a very entertaining Pay Per Veiw. The Scott Hall vs. Goldberg ladder match was spectacular, but 50 dollars? You can go to a Sam Goody or Blockbuster and find this for 15 bucks. The verdict: 5 star PPV but you have to be insane to purchare it for $50."
3,THE BEGINNING OF AN DYNASTY,"THIS EVENT WAS THE FIRST TIME YOU GOT TO SEE DAVID FLAIR WRESTLE ALSO HIS FIRST WCW PPV APPEARANCE ,SURE THE UNDER CARD WASNT ONE OF THE BEST BUT ANY TRUE WRESTLING FAN WOULD WANT TO HAVE THIS TAPE IN THEIR LIBRARY CAUSE YEARS FROM NOW DAVID FLAIR WILL BE ANOTHER BIG NAME AND BIG TIME PLAYER IN THE WRESTLING BUSINESS ,BUT THE GOLDBERG VS HALL MATCH WAS ANOTHER BIG TIME MATCH THAT DID LIVE UP TO BEING ANOTHER BIG PROMOTED MAIN EVENT MATCH GET THE TAPE."
1,You gotta be stupid to buy this,Dont even think about getting this. I ordered it on PPV and it sucked. The undercard was terrible and the main event was alright but it could of been better. Dont waste your money on this.
1,Mediorcre at best,"I can forgive ppv's and wrestling shows with a few lame matches, as long as they have other matches that make up for it. This one had the bad matches... and that's it. The lucha match was ok but not as good as the three way at starcade of 98. And the Goldberg x Hall ladder match. There were only two cool bumps in that match, one was an elbow drop almost from the top by Scott, and the other was when Goldberg hit his head on the rope as he fell with the ladder, it looked liked he couldv'e seriously hurt his neck but got lucky. COME ON! The best slam of the night was a flub, an accident... boring tape don't get it."
3,"Great Band, Average Compilation","This is one of the more intelligent bands of the 70s. They might have been served better if it was a Roxy only set. Editions Of You, Song For Europe, Mother of Pearl, Thrill of It All, etc should have been on this. Hopefully, they will see fit to make a Roxy Music anthology soon. This CD served its purpose when it first came out as an overview to Roxy and Bryan Ferry's career. However, with a lot of lesser bands coming out with boxed sets or anthology packages, surely Roxy deserves one now."
2,Less is More,"This is a crummy compilation of a great band. The 1977 'Greatest Hits' is better. Unfortunately, it is out of print. The most glaring omission is 'The Thrill of it All.' In all, five songs are missing in action. A great Roxy Music collection should include, Manifesto, Avalon and the earliest Greatest Hits."
2,Not enough Hits,"This is the problem with a lot of greatest hits collections, they don't contain all the greatest hits...missing from this collection is ""don't stop the dance, kiss and tell, and I don't know which way to turn"". These are major omissions."
1,Can't Comment....,"....I never received this item. I was told it shipped May 1, 2009 by the seller. It's now June 1,2009. Still no cd!"
3,Good but not great.,This book did help me alot when it came to adding new monsters to my games since it has alot of the monsters in the warhammer world. It does not have all of them of course but I did not expect it to. The only down part to the book was the fact that it added no new monsters or any kind of varations on the monsters in there unless they where chaos monsters. I would have liked to see a good amount of new monster types in the book.
5,Review on Clausen Book,"John Clausen is the ""Bridget Jones"" of the writing world. Wedged in the midst of Clausen's stories that'll make you laugh out loud is some of the greatest and most practical advice I've ever seen in a writing book. Your job should be fun. And your dreams are doable. There's a ton of writing books on the shelf, but this is the one to get whether you're a rank beginner contemplating making the plunge into freelance writing as a career, or for those like me who have been here for a while and seriously in need of Continuing Education. If you buy one book this year, buy this one. Then go out and get another copy for a friend."
2,"HIP, period instruments can be taken too far","I've got the Concerto No. 1 on another CD with Norrington's take on the First Symphony. My review here is just about Concerto No. 1, as I've not heard Norrington's No. 2.Going with a Mozartian-sized orchestra, rather than something in at least the mid-40s on numbers, seems overly historically performed.So does using a fortepiano from right around 1800, when Beethoven railed against pianos of his day all his life.**TRUE** ""HIP"" conducting, while not reaching for a modern 9-foot Steinway, would at least have used an 1830s piano, if not somewhat later. Because that would have been the piano for which Beethoven himself longed, even lusted.I'm all with HIP tempos, dimished vibrato, etc. I've got Gardiner's complete symphony cycle, and used to have Hogwood's. But, this just isn't right."
5,The Big Fix,"Another phenomenal eco-documentary by the dynamic duo - Josh and Rebecca. This film is a great investigative journalism piece that skillfully highlights the environmental catastrophes of the BP oil spill, the underwhelming cleanup effort and community support of BP, and the consequences of our addiction to petroleum and the use of toxic dispersants on human and wildlife health."
3,"Good video footage, but are the sources credible fact or opinions?","This video has alot of information, but it is opinionated. If you were working on the rig or spill, lets hear what you saw or know."
1,problem with recording levels/volume,"The music is beautiful, of course. But the audio levels are terribly inconsistent. If we have the volume turned up loud enough to hear The Swan, for example, we get blasted out when the next track plays. I guess I got what I paid for. Hope this helps."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. It does not teach you how to meditate.,"This is not a book instructing you how to practice transcendental meditation!! It is just an advertisement for a $1500 course on meditation. Don't buy it. Instead, I recommend 'The Relaxation Response', a book that teaches TM and thoroughly explains its benefits."
1,If I wanted a book of testimonials,"I purchased this book looking for the actual methodology to learn to practice TM. Instead I got a long winded explanation of what TM is & is Not & testimonials out the yazoo. Oh yeah PAGE 191 tells me where I can go spend the money I don't have to go learn how to practice TM. Mr. Roth must be very unstressed & contented, sitting on his pile of cash from selling this misleading tome about well..nothing I didn't already know before. Thanks for nothing. 0 Stars is not available or that would be my rating"
1,Just a sales gimmick for TM,I was expecting a how to book on improving my meditation skills but instead it is a book on what TM can do for you as long as you pay for a training session.THis book is a waste of money if you want to learn meditation skills.
1,Don't waste your money,"This book doesn't explain how to meditate, it's a lengthy sales pitch to get you to have a personal instructor teach you, which will cost you thousands of dollars. There are other sources which are just as effective without all of the cost. Try ""The Master Key System"" by Charles F. Haanel. He actually teaches you, this book is a poorly written, lengthy sales pitch which can be summed up to this: Transcendental Meditation has proven health benefits, and you can only learn this technique from a personal instructor."" There, I just saved you the cost and the time of purchasing and reading this mind-numbing drivel."
1,It's Only an Infomercial,"I was looking for the ""How To"" book which apparently does not exist on the subject. This book is like a quick speel from a salesman who wants you to plunk down a chunk of money for something. In this case it's for the class which is conviently offered around the country for a mere $1000. Look elsewhere for help, this is only hype."
3,"Not a how-to book, just a why-you-ought-to book","Like the other reviewers, I read TM hoping to discover how to actually mediate. What I found was a book that featured charts summarizing past studies on the benefits of Transcendental Meditation. I did not find out how to promote better health, unfold my creative potential nor create peace in the world having read this book.To actually learn TM, according to Robert Roth, you need to traverse 8 steps which involve attending seminars and listening to tapes.This book is helpful to those who'd like to conduct research on the effectiveness of TM simply because the references used in the book refer to several clinical studies on TM.If you want a practical ""How To"" guide on meditation check out Kathleen McDonald's ""How to Meditate: A Practical Guide""."
1,"Huge Sales Brochure, little more.","This book DOES NOT reveal any techniques for TM. It is little more than a huge sales brochure to get you to buy the TM course at your local TM center. If you want to learn TM or any kind of meditation, this book is not for you. I gave it a '1' only because '0' is not an option."
3,"Certainly a good program, but not the best","I read most of Transcendental Meditation book and enjoyed it, even though most of it was testimonials. I think where TM really falls short is the fact that they get you to concentrate more on the technique rather than what you goal it. (The technique is merely the tool you use to get there.) However, it is one of the easiest ways to calm down your mind and improve the quality of your life. Anyone who is meditating is very well off in the spiritual sense"
5,I like this book a lot!,"My story: I have tried many meditation techniques over the years and finally tried TM. It blew my mind, it was different, really better. Then I read Robert Roth's book. I liked it a lot. It doesn't tell you how to meditate,true, but that is because traditionally meditation has been taught one to one, by a trained teacher. I no longer buy into the idea--promoted by famous doctors trying to sell books--that you can learn real meditation out of a book. It doesn't always work. Check out the research. So whatever you do, whatever technique you learn, find out if it really works. And don't buy into the new age blather that all techniques are the same. (Are all medicines the same? Doubtful) Anyway, those are my thoughts..."
3,informative !!,"A very good introduction to TM. Should be read by anyone who wants to know more about Transcendental Meditation.I must, however, make a very severe comment. The author portrays TM as a kind of infallible magic. I have no doubt about his sincerity. Bit I cannot accept the argument that TM must be learnt from a face-to-face interview with a teacher and cannot be learnt by reading a book or listening to a tape. TM is not that much different from auto-suggestion, self-hypnosis or the Silva Mind Control or even prayer. It costs about $1600 (in Canada, as of Oct 2004) to be enrolled in a TM course with a teacher. Are you trying to raise money for the TM organisation Mr. Roth ?"
4,This book is good but you must spend $2500 to learn TM,"TM is the most effective meditation technique out there (scientifically validated), but if you want to learn TM you have to spend $2500! Fortunately a few independent teachers, such as Raymond Harrison or the TM Independent UK group, are teaching TM for a reasonable price."
1,Disappointed,"I was under the impression I would actually be reading about the techniques, breath work, mantra, etc. used in TM. I feel like I bought a book of advertising and contact lists. I wish I had read reviews on this before I purchased it!"
5,OEM replacement,"replaced the old unit perfectly. super simple to install. hardest part of the install was removing the trim piece off the dash and putting it back on, and that was easy too."
3,didn't fix problem,"not sure if its something more internal with my vehicle, even though the dealership said it was that, or this unit was bad. I returned it for a full refund."
3,I am a little disappointed,"You can't beat the thoroughness of this cookbook. It literally has everything from soup to nuts. Unfortunately, the title is a bit misleading. When I think of an ""expanded and illustrated edition"" that is over 800 pages, I would think that there would be some pictures of the recipes. That isn't the case at all. There is a small section of cultural pictures in the middle of the book, but no recipe photos. I wish I would have known this prior to purchase. Come on amazon...do a better job with your descriptions!"
3,Polish Heritage Cookery,"This is the companion book to another by the small author. Really like the idea about the the traditions and history being in the book. However, my feelings about this book is the same as the other. Good representation of Polish cooking, however, a difficult recipe book to read and follow. Recipes are in paragraph style and addtional time is needed to determine the ingredients. Not sure the recipes were edited and tested as written as I found I had to adjust each one that I used.The concept was good but the delivery was poor. Perhaps the author/book publisher should have created versions for the US and Europe."
5,Great Cookbook!,"My husband is Polish, so I wanted an authetic Polish Cookbook to use! If you want such a book, this one is for you!"
5,Best Polish Cookbook,It's the best! Whatever my sister or I have tried from this cookbook tastes *just* like Babci used to make!!! I'd recommend this one to any cook who wants to eat like he or she used to at their grandmother's house!
4,Spike Strip,Pretty sweet product... now if i only had a skid lid to put it on. The strip isn't exactly what's shown; there's actually a larger spike set right in the middle of all the regular sized ones (about twice as big). I plan on getting a helmet for it now because i wasn't thinking it wouldn't fit on my full-face.
5,You have helped our family tremendously!,"I have five sons, two of whom are autistic. I cannot express my gratitude enough for your beautifully conceived and produced programs at Special Kids! They address each subject so simply, yet so thoroughly, that my youngest autistic child began learning from them well before the age of two, and before he had any expressive language at all. Since that time, he has learned the entire alphabet, numbers, shapes and colors, parts of the body, how a day goes and much more, directly from these programs. All this has helped him better relate to us, his family, to his special ed teachers, and to the world around him. It has also encouraged his expressive language development. Everyone at Special Kids has contributed invaluably to my son's progress, and for that I THANK YOU!"
5,The best BLONDIE album!,"I don't agree with the other reviewer who said this is their punkiest album. BLONDIE was never punk, and this album wasn't their hardest. I do agree that it's their best, with PARALLEL LINES a close second. Then (in order) EAT TO THE BEAT, PLASTIC LETTER, EXIT, AUTOAMERICAN, and do we even need to mention HUNTER or CURSE?But this album is so consistently great. Songs like ""Kung Fu Girls"" and ""Rifle Range"" are as good as any pop song ever recorded, but it seems they've been completely forgotten. In fact, this whole album seems to be forgotten. There's a DVD I found that has some of these songs performed live. Look for it! The title is BLONDIE - THE BEST OF MUSIKLADEN LIVE (1978)."
5,Great classic music,Blondie on top of their game.Debbie Harry sounds as great as ever!A good mix of upbeat song with outstanding vocals.'Nuff said.
4,A great start.,"Blondie (1976) DNC (What a shame).First album by these New York City pop new wave rockers. Debbie Harry who played the ice cold rock chick just fine. This album produced some great numbers in, ""Little Girl Lies"", ""Kung Fu Girls"", U.K. hits in ""In The Flesh"", ""X Offender"" and ""Rip Her To Shreds"". This band was just getting started, over the next 4 years they would produce some great music."
3,Very dissappointing,"Well the video is missing acouple of matches that was on the PPV and luckily I rented it so. It was missing Wrath vs. Meng ,Alex Wright vs. Fit Finly ,and Lodi vs. Saturn. After the Disco/Juvi match it showed Disco vs. Kidman but it had some great matches like Hart vs. Sting , Hall vs. Nash , Hogan vs. Warrior and DDP vs. Goldberg but try renting it first like i did."
2,Remake of a old WWF PPV,"This video was not worth watching on PPV, nor was it worth renting. If you want to see it, you can rent any WWF video from the 80. Even the hyped Warrior and Hogan match was huge disappointment. If it was not for the DDP VS Goldberg match, I would have turned it off."
3,Great Card but did not live up to hype,Halloween Havoc 98 is one of the best wrestling cards of alltime on paper. It is not that the matches were not good it you just expected more. The crusier wieght matches were ok except for the fact disco fought twice. Hogan vs Warrior sucked it was terrible. Bret vs Sting was good but I expected spectacular as Bret usally pulls off. Goldberg vs ddp was pretty good considering Goldberg is so terrible. Nash vs Hall was incrediblly dissaponting. But Rick Steiner did steal the show winning both tag belts. If you are a Rick stiener fan this is for you.
2,POOR,"i expected more for this card,the hogan vs warrior math was horrible,i am an stinger fan but ,sting vs breat hart was bored,i liked goldeberg vs ddp,but the undercard was really bad,i was very dissapointed after seeing this video."
5,The finest solo Irish fiddle playing,"I heard him interview on NPR with Terry Gross on ""Fresh Air"" in 1994 and when they played a segment of one song on the airwaves, I knew I just had to go out and buy it. So I did. I have never tired of this CD. His playing is magnificent and the music is superb!"
4,Great Chair,"Pros: Compact, light, easy to carry, low to the ground when you want to sit in front of a large group of people, allows the ground to be your footrest. Nice reclined seating position with headrest.Cons: Low seating position is more difficult to get in and out of. Tripod legs (two together in the back) can make it a little unstable leaning over or getting in and out of the chair."
5,Great but why is it censored?,"I love this band and I love this album but my copy is obviously censored. There are many spots where the audio drops out and in some instances, it is easy to tell where the F word would be. I hate the fact that they are doing this to so much music these days but because I am over 50 years old, I should have a choice. Has anyone else noticed this problem? Is there an uncensored version?"
5,fantastic!,theory of a deadman is awesome and this cd is no exception. i have it in my car and listen to it daily
1,Yikes,"I, like a previous reviewer, feel as though I've wasted my money. Luckily the CD was $9 at bestbuy - which was actually why I bought it. Definitely a waste of money though. This CD is just really mediocre and bland and way too light for my tastes. Think Creed but worse."
1,Whoops,"Whoops, I just wasted 13 bucks. These guys suck! Maybe one of the worst records I have heard in a long time. Think Lit with some back country. If you like the single, that's all you'll like. Don't waste your money...you'll soon forget about them."
2,Is a Nickelback CD,"Give me a break and get some originality. Say Goodbye could be on the next Nickelback album, this is just a product of where the whole music industry seems to be trending, all the same."
4,A Juno Award 2006 Nominee,"This is the second album from Theory of a Deadman, a Canadian rock band with a large following that includes video game and wrestling fans as well as rock music lovers everywhere. Their popularity has led to two nominations for Juno Awards in April 2006, for ""Group of the Year"" and ""Rock Album of the Year"".There are several buzz-worthy tracks on this album, my favorite being ""Santa Monica"", which is the track chosen for the Juno Awards 2006 CD. Others are first single ""No Surprise""; ""Hello Lonely (Walk Away From This)""; ""Better Off"" and ""Say Goodbye"". The other tracks are mostly your standard rock fare with lots of guitars and drums, but good listening of you're in the mood to rock.Amanda Richards, March 21, 2006"
5,Theory of a Deadman are their own man,"I am tired of hearing all the comparisons to Nickelback. Sure I see the similarities, but I honestly think Theory of a Deadman is better because they are less pop oriented, like the Nickelback of old. Nickelback has become a pop driven, radio oreinted, overplayed rock band. I still like them, but I feel Theory of a Deadman is still original, and vastly underplayed, this is an amazing band that deserves all the attention they garner. Anyways, onto the album...Gasoline is a wonderful sophomore album by TOADM. I am not torn between their first and second album. Ironically I listened to the first one just a week ago like non-stop. I think this one will get the same attention. All of the songs on here are solid a resonate of their own sound. I especially liked Santa Monica, Save the Best for Last, Hello Lonely, and No Surprise. Buy it now, it is worth every penny."
3,I didn't get it,"I ordered this used CD July 3rd. I recieved a package from ""Buybacks Colerain"". It did not have THeory of a Deadman Gasoline. It had a DVD of some B movie I never heard of. I sent it back to Buybacks and still have not recieved the CD I ordered 7 weeks ago. I also have not heard back from anyone. So far I'm out the cost of the CD, postage, and postage and packaging to return it.I normally am pleased buying used CD's and DVD's from Amazon, but not this time!"
4,Good stuff,"When it comes down to it, TOAD isn't as good as nickelback. However, judged on their own, they make some very solid rock music. ""Gasoline"" is just a continuation of their self-titled debut, with a few more tracks and some awesome guitar solos. If you liked their other album, or are a fan of default or nickelback, I'd say check these guys out. Good stuff."
3,"Could've been better, but good","This CD is pretty good even though it could've been better. Most of the songs have good lyrics, but you can almost hear the same melody over and over again which may give it somewhat a boring tune."
4,Great CD at a great price!,"This is a awesome CD, better than there last. The only problem that I have is that somehow i seem to have gotten an edited version of the CD but there is only one version to buy in the store and it did not say edited on it. Has this happened to anyone else? I don't need to here bad lanuage to make the music good, but it just makes me mad that if you are going to say it than say it and if you don't want to say it than don't but it is very poor to put out an album with blank spaced in it!"
3,sophmore slump,"this album just isn't as good as theory's s/t debut. of the 12 songs on here, only 7 or 8 are worth a listen, and the rest are fillers. it's too bad they got rid of chad kroeger for production, cuz' howard benson just doesn't work well with their music. I wouldn't discourage anyone from buying gasoline, but just know that its not going to be as good as s/t. pretty good, but after 5 or 6 listens, i was done with it. get s/t instead if you're a new fan."
5,Rockmusic - nothing more,"Pah!This is it. Pure rock music, nothing more. A brilliant voice and superb musicians comes in a firstclass production. These guys rock the world with overdose intention. Everything works fine. One of my faves for 2005, in line with JamisonParker, Jack's Mannequin and Tommy Lee. If you hear bands like Default (TOAD seems a little harder) or Ra (TOAD seems a little more directly) this is the perfect item! Enyoy and all the best for you."
4,Hmmmm,"Well, I have to admit..it's a really good album, however my favorite song ""No Surprise"" is indeed censored. It's the only song that happens to be censored on the album. Unfortunately there is no explicit version of it. To hear the better uncensored version you have to buy the ""No surprise"" single..oh well."
4,A Good CD,"I bought this CD for one song and ended up liking most of them. The main thread of the CD is that the songwriter got burned by his significant other. A little more uplifting songs would have been nice. But overall, I am enjoying the music - some rock, some ballads. Pretty consistent sound. I will look forward to their next one."
4,Oh Ya,"Love this stuff. But this review is for track 10 - ""Since You've Been Gone"" . Way to go Guys!!! You hit it right with this one.If TOADM decides to do an acoustic album - it will be good. I look forward to it. Several of the songs on Gasoline are pretty good - But "" Since You've Been Gone"" - Is Excellent."
3,Not as good as their debut release,"Not a bad release. No Surprise is definitely the best track on this release by far. Some other good songs include...Santa Monica, Say Goodbye, Hello Lonely, and Better Off.The quality of the songs drastically drop off after No Surprise though, as others have stated.One thing I will say is that the first CD is a hell of a lot better than this effort, and for the ones turned off by this one, should purchase or Download some songs from the debut CD."
4,One of the Best Hootie Albums,"You could say that this (along with Musical Chairs) may be the best Hootie-related album after Cracked Rear View. These are more than pass-overs for Hootie records (the moving City By a River is the only one the whole band was in on writing). The guitar work here is definetely his best yet and more diverse than on Hootie albums. The songs cover a broad emotional spectrum and several could have been hits if this wonderful album had the promotion it deserved. I highly recommend this to anyone fan who wants intelligent, heart-felt rock and roll. It may be three years old now, but its still in heavy rotation in my CD player."
4,30 on the Rail,"The CD 30 on the Rail is a great buy if you are a diehard Hootie fan. Mark Bryan is great as a soloist and shows his great depth not only as a musician but as artist. Songs like City by a River are sure to be favorites, perhaps even in mainstream."
4,Pella.Nappo@Worldnet.att.net,"This solo by Mark Bryan makes you want to, ""Roll down the windows and let the wind blow back your hair"". His voice has come a long way....job well-done Mark!I short you one star, soley because you aren't jamming that six string in my livingroom!"
1,Vocals are very weak,Many of the most die hard Hootie fans won't enjoy this effort from Hootie's guitarist. The main problem is the very weak vocal talent of Mark Bryan.
4,Excellent hardware but the maps are little bit old,"I had this gps device for a year, the hardware is excellent:you have big screen, bluetooth, AV input and AV output, SD card slot, good processor, good gps chipset and receives TMS.The bad thing about it, is the maps and the UI. However you can update the maps and the UI and get better interface."
3,"Good Bag, Zipper Issues","Bought this bag a year ago for the same 70% discount currently listed. Glad I did not pay more.Pros: It is a handsome bag, and the internal pocket layout is great. The pockets are lined with a soft synthetic material. The outer large pocket expands to hold a pair of shoes and a rolled up shirt. Feels very comfortable on my back even fully loaded.Cons: very quickly, the waterproof coating on the zippers, a kind of vinyl tape started wearing off. It comes loose from the zipper and then tears off, leaving behind a white dusty film that is hard to remove. One of the zipper pulls on the main compartment broke recently.Fine bag at deep discount, but don't pay full price for this one."
5,comfy and big enough,"I like it cuz it's comfy and there is a lot of space inside!!! I'm a girl so this is the biggest backpack that still looks stylish on woman shoulders - not too bulky!!! I always have some free space left there. It's ok to take it to the beach or in the city :)Though there is one thing I am not really satisfied about - the zippers. They're not really comfy and I need to pull hard in order to zip or unzip, it should be easier..."
5,Stylish bag with all the right pockets,"I tested several bags before going back to this one. I've had the brown version of the Mountainsmith Market St for 2 years. I'd really liked its organization and professional look, but the zipper tabs broke fairly quickly. The black one is organized the same way, but so far (2 months) has proven to be well-made with high quality materials and all the right features."
4,Bag Pack,The quality of the bag is excellent and the bag is spacious. Have enough pockets to carry all the accessories along with laptop.
2,Wanted to love it..... disappointing construction.,"I really wanted to love this backpack and have continued to use it. The form and size were perfect for my needs.However, within 6 months of purchasing it, BOTH of the zipper pulls on the main compartment broke off. Very poor performance for a premium priced backpack.I put some twist ties in as replacement pulls - but for >$70 I expect more than disposable hardware."
4,A Good Collection,"This is a very nice ""best of"" CD, although fairly short (about 40-45 minutes). Juliette Greco has amazing range and vocal control. The songs vary from the sultry ""Deshabillez-Moi"" (undress me) to the hyper ""Un petit poisson, un petit oiseau"" (a little fish, a little bird). Her pronunciation is so distinct that it's easy to sing along or listen to the story she tells. Reccomended."
5,Fabulous find,Love this cd. Juliette has an unparalleled sultry voice. A must-own for her fans. Fantastic service from seller.
4,You Can Go Home,"There are times where artists get better with age, and the appeal that has continued to maintain with feeling to the fans. For Bon Jovi, they've still got it after nearly 25 years of driven Rock and Pop music. Their latest single still shows the group has still a whole lot of heart. Who Says You Can't Go Home, the second single from the groups' 2005 album Have A Nice Day, still shows the band at their best. The single comes in a tough time for Richie Sambora, following his divorce to Heather Locklear. Despite that, the song is one of my favorites out there right now, and I definitely love this song.Song: B+"
4,2 Out of 3 Isn't Bad,"The Vampire Sextette is a book that is comprised of six stories written by six different authors. As one would expect, not every person is going to enjoy every story that is contained in this volume. I enjoyed two out of the three stories I've read from this book thus far. When I first picked this up, I was expecting something different than what I found myself reading, but I was not disappointed. If you're looking to read stories about vampires that have a different twist, then I would recommend this book."
5,"Original, Unique, A Breath of Fresh Air","jane Child is the most original Female Artist I have had the pleausre to encounter. She has a remarkable background in classic music and it shows through out here albums. Jane Child is also a remarkable songwriter and producer. Unfortunately her record company, like many others, do not appreciate the raw talent that this artist bring to every track. Jane Child is another one of those overlooked artist like Siedah Garrett, Cherrelle, and many many others that have pure unadulterated talent. Jane, if you ever get a chance to read this please try to find another record company, there are people in this world that really do appreciate you and your Music. You are a MasterCraftsWomen of Original MasterPieces. God Bless You"
3,HOGANS LAST GOOD MATCH,"Soak it up Hulkamaniacs or is it NWO-ites...who knows anyway this actually renewed my faith in Hogan for like a 20 hours, until Nitro. Hogan somehow turned out a babyface performance and Flair well Flair's always good, Hogan loses but its good to see Hogan actually working a match, probably because in the cage you have to be original to get over. GOOD PPV, one of WCW's few"
4,Excellent!,"Great traditional playing from two great Irish musicians. Sounds a bit like the pub music I heard when in Ireland, and it takes me back."
4,Still trying to find themselves,"Plastic Letters is Blondie second album and was released on October 1977. The cassette is thirty-four minutes and forty-six seconds long and reached #72 on the US Billboard 200 Album Chart. None of the songs on this cassette charted in the United States. Two of the songs however, peaked on the UK singles chart. Denis at #2 and (I'm Always Touched by Your) Presence, Dear #10. Plastic Letters is a good album; not great. You can tell by this album that the group has not converted to the disco sound. Plastic Letters by Blondie gets a B+.Side 1Fan MailDenisBermuda Triangle Blues (Flight 45)Youth Nabbed As SniperContact In Red Square(I'm Always Touched By Your) Presence, DearI'm On ESide 2I Didn't Have The Nerve to Say NoLove At the PierNo ImaginationKidnapperDetroit 442Cautious Lip"
4,Getting closer to perfection.,"Blondie ""Plastic Letters"" (1977) #72.Second album by these New Yorkers. You get UK hits in, ""Denis"", ""I'm Always Touched By Your Presence Dear"". Other highlights were, ""Love On The Pier"", ""Detroit 442"", ""Fan Mail"" and Contact On Red Square"". America took awhile, to warm to this band. Their next release would put them over the top."
5,Blondie is the best. This CD is a must have classic!,What can I say - Blondie is great and this early CD is very raw and exciting.
2,not as good as their first one,"This Album from Blondie was released in 1977, it wasn't my favorite album by them, but it does have it's moments, I like the songs ""Detroit 442"" and ""I'm Alway In Touch By Your Presence dear"" Very Nice, even though it's just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to their next Fallowing albums."
3,Folksy waste of my time!!!!,"I thought this movie would offer some insight into the meaning of life in Greene County Pa. Instead, what I was treated to, was two separate story lines that only connected slightly at the end. Until then, they just ran and sputtered along without doing much other than reflecting what was going in the lives of one group of people. I would not suggest this book, but only because it felt more like a home video, not an actual documentary."
1,Christian products should carry a warning,Had I known this DVD was wholesome Christian product rather than an unbiased documentary I would never have purchased it.
5,The Greatest Tanning Gel On the Planet,"Bought this item last year and sported the best tan I have ever had without staying out all the time. Love the Glitter Look! The store I bought it from last year isn't carring it this year, so I will be buying this online by the truck load.Tanned in Texas"
5,CAN'T FIND IT ANYMORE -- HELP!!,"My three adult daughters and I are true ""sun worshipers"", and this stuff is the BEST!! Better than the expensive stuff, too. But, since about the middle of last summer until now (5/2006) we have searched high & low. As a last resort I have turned to the internet looking to buy it, and can't even find it here. If anyone knows where it is being sold, please let me know!! We have tried FL, LA, TN, VA, MD, NC, SC, GA etc, etc. Thanking you in advance. Trish (longbeachgirl@comcast.net)"
5,"Great satire, incredible music, what more can you ask for?","This film is not a docmentary on the band L7. There is some great live music in between short skits that are about todays music industry. L7 is a great band and has been around for a long time. Like most people with a brain they are sick of the industry manufacturing music and bands that have absolutly nothing to say or to do with anything except to get little kids to spend thier parents hard earned money on. Most of these new ""musicians"" arien't old enough to even understand the lyrics they're singing. L7 is a real band that write thier own songs. This video proves that you're not the only one out there wanting real music from real bands and that they truley exist. This Video ROCKS!!!"
3,"Excellent satire, OK sound","This is not a concert film or a documentary, it's a film made up of short skits lampooning the music industry interspersed with concert footage of L7. That being said, the film is excellent, although hampered by poor sound. This is OK enough during the skits, but a real drawback during the concert scenes. The skits don't have big laughs like THIS IS SPINAL TAP, but are still amusing and are very consistent, which is rare when dealing with episodic storylines. The film was mostly improvisational, so the gals aren't overly emoting or reading their dialogue instead of acting. Bryan Brown nearly steals the show as a sleazy record exec in a hilarious bit of acting.All in all, a fun film and well worth the money."
5,Morgenthau's Story,"Excellent addition to World War I history and its underpinnings. Also a good description, if not somewhat biased, of the Armenian Massacre."
1,"He lied before,he's probably lying again.","People have to keep in mind that Morgenthau was the originator of one of the most celebrated anti-German propaganda myths of WWI,the Crown Council story.When investigated after the war this incident was found to be completetly false.Morgenthau obviously had no qualms about making things up for propaganda purposes.He has to be considered an unreliable source of information.If he lied once he's probably lying here too."
4,Helped get a cheap guitar back in shape,"I picked up a beat up guitar really cheap, but it had a couple of high frets that I had to file down. After filing, I needed to recrown a couple of frets. This thing worked great."
2,Don't triffle with the Triffids,"Granted the book is dedicated to John Wyndham and has the evident approval of his estate. Yet one of the great sci-fi writers of the last century must be rolling in his grave over this episodic and often downright silly romp, loaded with absurd plot contrivances and strained dialogue. Wyndham was a model of intelligence and restraint. Here Simon Clark goes for the gusto, creating cardboard heroes and Snidley Whiplash villains in what reads like a tribute to dimestore pulp sci-fi. In a word: Dumb."
3,"good, but make sure you dont have it.","If you already own kepharts ""camping & woodcraft"" then dont waste your money on this book. it has all just been taken from ""camping & woodcraft""If you dont have it then its a very interesting book."
2,"Good idea, bad execution","Terrible printing. It looks like the current publisher found an old beat up copy of the original, photo copied it, and reprinted from that. Much of the text just fades out or is indiscernible at times. Quite disappointed actually"
4,Window to the past.,"Lots of interesting information, however, some of the recommended products may no longer be available. A fun read. Particularly helpful advise for processing and utilizing wild game of all types."
1,Poor Quality,"The first book that I received was a Camp Cookery cover and a computer book inside, I returned it. The second book I received was a poor zerox copy that I couldn't read so I returned it for a refund. Amazon said they could not refund my money as they had provided a replacement. I'm confused and will not order Amazon sponsored books again."
4,Lovely! My favorite deck for relationship readings!,"This is a beautifully illustrated deck, and perfect for relationship readings. With only the 22 Major Arcana cards represented, I find that readings with this deck cut to the heart of the matter in a very straight-forward, concise way. The book focuses on relationship issues, as well, and, as many readers know, about 90% of our querents want to know about their love lives! This lovely deck is a great helpmate...and just plain ol' pretty!"
5,Excellent!,"I found these tarot cards to be straight forward and easy to use. They were helpful in helping me see things that were happening in my love life, and as well as in my everyday dealings. I would highly recommend this tarot deck and beautifully illustrated book to anyone"
3,nice book,"I was surprised to get a book bc I'd known this as a Tarot deck. I was ok with the book since the illustrations were in color. The seller said if there were any problems to write and she'd take care of it. One problem was that the book smelled terribly of cigarette smoke. Had I known this, I would not have purchased the book as I am allergic to cigarette smoke. I never got a reply from the seller."
3,The full deck,"Some years ago I saw the only Major deck. When I found this complete deck I'd ordered straightaway. I still think that the Major are very beautiful and their composition are very lovely, but I'd like to find a similar process on the Minor that are too simple.Blessings:)CofS"
5,Great Bag,Bought this as a christmas gift for my nephew and it arrived quickly and well packaged. The bag seems very sturdy.
3,It's Ok,"I'm not really liking this back pack much. The zipper pull broke right away and the zipper itself doesn't pull smoothly. I like the design of it and the camo print is nice and fabric is a heavy duty kind, but I feel I'll need to get another camo backpack that will be a little bigger, and have a better zipper."
3,Intriguing first novel..,"Poul Anderson's ""Vault of the Ages"" is a good tale of life going on after all is lost. Set 500 years after a nuclear disaster, a tribe in what is now the Alleghanies tries desparately to keep an invader from taking over. The son of a chiefian seeks shelter in a place that the others in his tribe are afraid of, and finds a very large time capsule in which the technology of our day is preserved in record. The rest deals with the invading horde which desparately needs fertile land or it'll strave and the fears of the tribe. Anderson showed his good writing from the beginning"
3,Easy,"The shoe was just what I wanted, but I ordered a size too big. The company was quick, and handled my transaction without any problems!"
1,poor,"My cat stuck his nose up at the dried fish, i gave it to someone else and her cat didn't like it either, it was a total waste of money!"
5,meow meow,"my brothers cat would kill for these dried fish yummies. my neighbors cat didn't care for them, but she is of the finicky type."
3,The Bible in the Latin West,"This volume reveiws the texts of Latin and vernacular translations of the Bible from late antiquity to the about the time of the invention of the printing press. The book covers several existing manuspcripts and texts and discusses their style, lenght, script type, brief historical setting and other usefull information for the person looking for the history of different versions and transalations of the Bible, plus information for those interested in late antique and medieval manuscripts. I was dissapointed at the black and white reproduction of what must be gorgeous colored texts and the fact that the book does not goes in depth into the subject. Still is an interesting tome to have for those who are interested in the subject."
4,"""Zombie like"" Mutants","Another Movie recently watched on Netflix in HD. This time French with English subtitles and a pretty good zombie type movie. I won't give away the whole plot but here are some general thoughts...Much of the theme is about seeing a loved one turn into something unrecognizable.Stars Sonia (Helene de Fougerolles) who was inThe Beach(at least that's where I recognized her from) and Marcus (Francis Renaud).Although technically these aren't the undead, but the infected. It still has that ""zombie-like"" feel to it. They're infected, they bite you, you become infected...Good makeup work for the monsters. Everything looked good in HD, although being filmed in Winter in Europe, everything has kind of a gray and moody tone to it. Even blood was very dark colored and realistic looking.The acting is top notch..just in French. Far better than B movie grade.* Die Hard zombie fans will enjoy this as a rental.Others not really into the genre will probably want to avoid."
4,Good but I expected more.,"Mutants is a good horror film but I did expect more. The film is well directed and the set designs, art direction, make up and special effects are all top-notch. It deals with the mutation of one of the main characters and moves rather slowly. The film's pace picks up in the second half. For some reason I did expect more and felt that the film could have benefited from the use of more characters and their plight against the mutants that are running amok."
3,Not as good as the fan hype,"Note the photo on the cover - about the last 15-20 minutes of the film, you get to see some of that and then-- the film is pretty active. The film up to that point is s-l-o-w and much akin to a one man or 2 man stage act. We follow the man and woman around the place while he slowly (very) becomes infected and much angst and weariness ensues. Well acted (very, in fact) but just slower than I expected and not punctuated with any spikes in the storyline untill the end - then it lights up big time! So an okay film, but you'll need lots of patience to get to the stuff you likely rented or bought the movie for -- for sure, rent 1st."
1,What the heck DVD doesnt work on DVD player,"When I bought this I was all excited and ready to roll. I popped it in the DVD player and it doesn't even work. I got busy doing something else and am too late to send it back, plus it was no Amazon but some contract via Amazon. I think you are better off if you try to stick strictly with Amazon and avoid the discounts. Oh well win some loose some."
2,WHAT?,"OK, I LISTENNNNNNNNNNNNNING TO THE FREAKIN ALBUM AND IM WAITINGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG FOR A GOOD SONG. BASICALLY LIKE 4 SONGS WERE GOOD. THE REST WERE WACK. THE BEATS WERE OVERRATED. THE SINGLE AND LIKE THREE OTHERS WERE HOT BUT EVERYTHING ELSE WAS [...]. I WANT MY MONEY BACK. I SHOULD HAVE BOOTLEGGED THE ALBUM CAUSE THIS GUY [...]."
1,Please do not LISTENN,"This guy is so overrated. He has been in Miami ruining the radio with his wack mixes and constant screaming. If your from 305 you will know what I mean. Now he may have ruinded some MC's careers by adding them to his so called CD. Only the young bucks like him and its a shame because they are growing up listening to cr@p! The whole CD is lame, thank goodness I heard it from someone else since I would never spend a dime on this. How he got into TS is beyond me. I feel it's an insult to TS. They must have felt sorry for him. PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS!"
4,deffinitly hot,"hot album from DJ Khaled although it should not be his since he does nothing but scream and talk. Alot of artist on here: trick daddy, pitbull, rick ross, lil wayne, paul wall, krayzie bone, twista, fat joe, and more. Best songs, Destroy You w/ Twista Krayzie Bone, Born N Raised w/ Rick Ross, Pitbull, Trick Daddy and Holla At me w/ Lil Wayne, Rick Ross, Fat Joe, Paul Wall, Pitbull."
5,Born and Raised in the county of DADE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This album is so hot it'll leave yo draws on fi-ya. It's hot from the time you pop it in till the time you take it out, and that's if you take it out. Everyone on this mix is on fire right now, he got the best artist out and it gets no betta'. You gotta check it out. Xpectially if you from FL. Please believe, it'll leave you proud and reppin' yo hood. Don't sleep on this, you gone want it in your collection and don't be left out cause everyone's gone be on it. Lissteeeennnnn!!!!!"
1,POOR JUDGEMENT ON THE SUPPLER.,"IT,S A GREAT MOVIE IF YOU COULD SEE IT.IT NOT IN THE REGION.AND AGAIN THE SUPPLER GOT PLETY OF EMAILS ON THIS.I JUST HOPE NO ONE EVER DEALS WITH THIS SUPPLER."
3,it's NOT an album--,I saw this song on YouTube and went to amazon to order the CD....I thought it was an album by the same name...this is ONLY the single!!!!
3,Not a simple introduction,"This is a case of writing that seems clear if you already know the material, but opaque if you don't. The author states that she wrote for ""linguists whose training has been in other theories and who want to learn the essentials of GB theory"". She assumes a lot, introducing concepts without explanation. I think a year of syntax is prerequisite. A reader wanting a basic introduction to transformational grammar would probably be better off reading the first few chapters of Ouhalla."
5,The dream of the broken-hearted,"David Lynch discovered her and made her part of his world, a paralel world that we've seen through his films and TV series. Some of this songs composed by Angelo Badalamenti, with lyrics by Lynch, have appeared in ""Twin Peaks"" (""Falling"", ""The nightingale"", ""Into de night""), ""Blue Velvet"" (""Mysteries of love""), and are part of the video-concert ""Industrial symphony #1: The dream of the broken-hearted"", which shows an intriguin lady (Julee Cruise) floating, falling, singing the ups and downs of a love. This album, just like her following production ""The voice of love"", is full of a really nice soft swing capable to wrap you up."
4,songbirds,"quite simply, if you are a fan of Twin Peaks, then you need this album. it's lovely nighttime music that is spooky and serenely beautiful with flourishes of jazz and new age. Julie's vocals are sweet and tender and float right over the music. you can't help but think of scenes from the Twin Peaks television series when you play this cd at home. everytime i hear it, it makes me want to break out my old vhs box set, make some coffee and cherry pie, and watch the whole series from start to finish."
4,Ethereal and sexy !,I had originally bought this almost 16 years ago and it has been one album that I listen to from beginning to end. I would highly recommend it for one of those evenings that you just want to chill out or a romantic encounter.....but not a house party !
4,Well Above Average ... But Not Five-Star Material,"Like many people, I first learned of Julee Cruise through her songs on ""Twin Peaks."" I bought ""Into The Night"" in 1991 or so and have played it many times. Her voice is ethereal and haunting, but on some of the cuts the lyrics are weak or obscure, or the instrumental track overpowers her. I recommend this album, but don't expect perfection!"
4,A happy banshee!,"If you like Enya or Loreena McKennitt, you'll like Julee Cruise. The lilting voices inside lovely melodies, reminding one of a fairy gathering at twilight in Ireland!"
4,"Pretty good, Pretty good, Pretty neat, Pretty neat.",Just ordered this terrific cd - Music to slit your wrists to.
5,"Dreamy, oh so dreamy.","After the popularity of the Twin Peaks soundtrack, David Lynch and Angelo Badalamenti collaborated with Julee Cruise to produce this fantastic album. Includes songs from Twin Peaks and Blue Velvet. Lynch's lyrics come straight from the dark side of the brain, as does Angelo's music. And Julee's voice floats it all right up to radiator heaven."
3,this ppv had good and bad matchs,in my opinion don't buy this ppv i mean the juvi vs. kidman match was good and the steiner vs. steiner match wasd good because steiner gave goldberg the finger but the battle royale was too predictable everyone knew nash would win but the main event of page vs. bret hart sucked i mean what kind of main event is for the u.s. title especially when the hitman gets cheated by the ref don't buy this movie
2,Not Good,It was the worst world war 3 event. If you want to see a good WW3 ppv then buy any of them except this one.
4,"A good story on its own, a great sequel...","The second in the Bath and Body Series can be read independently and enjoyed on its own but fits great in the series. Relationships developed in the first book evolve naturally and new characters appear to add intrigue and romance.The plot centers around corporate espionage in the beauty industry. Venus Envy, the spa owned and operated by the main character Persia and her aunt Florence, is struggling to make ends meet and being outdone by a new player in town - Bebe.The first part of the book is a little slow for readers who've read the first book. The final showdown between Bebe and Persia is, however, intriguing and entertaining. Overall the book is a good second in the series and leaves you anxious for the next book."
4,A correction to previous reviews,"This is a well-written, mainstream whodunit that will be enjoyed by almost any reader who enjoys this genre. The only reason I'm posting this review at all is that a couple of previous reviewers have, inexplicably, objected to the book on the grounds of language and sex. Let me assure anyone who reads this review, that those previous reviewers are WAY outside the mainstream of society on this point. If this book were turned, verbatim, into a movie, it would receive a PG13 rating. There is nothing in it that would make me even slightly uncomfortable in giving it to a 15-year-old to read. Unless you confine your reading to Dr. Seuss and Jan Karon's appalling ""Mitford"" series, there is nothing in this book that will even make you blink."
3,Not Too Cozy Cozy,"If profanity, cavalier sex and New Age attitudes don't bother you then, you might like this series. But if you like your cozies G-Rated, then this series probably isn't for you. Possibly only PG-17, this second installment in the Bath & Body Mysteries series is peppered with profanity and casual sex. Although parts of the plot were a bit weak (the altercation between Aunt Florence & Persia), it was interesting enough to keep me reading until the end."
2,Died Young,"I have one of these. It worked fine last year, but when I took it out of storage to get it going this Fall it wouldn't make a vacuum or seal any type bag - a little noise, a click, and that's all I got. I tried various sizes and brands of bags - no dice. I wish I had saved the receipt because it's still under warranty. Oh well, too bad. Now I'll get a Food Saver."
3,OK but it has issues,"The bag cutter is a pain.Sometimes the bag cuts smoothly but half the time it does not. Perhaps that is because the slide and the cutter are weak plastic. I got this as a gift so I won't return it.When it works, it does a nice job."
1,Always breaks,"We purchased one of these and it worked for about the length of the warranty. The sealer strip burned out and the company said no parts were available for this model, but I could buy a new one. It was around $100. That is expensive for a product that lasted one year. I found a replacement strip from a commercial sealer company and fixed it. About 6months later it died again. I put in another strip and it worked again. After every six months, it dies. Now the motor is dying and no replacements are available. The maker does not offer support in any way and parts are not around. Thank you Rival for your junk. Buy a Food-Saver and you will be happier."
1,Don't Bother,"I have a model similar to this one. I bought it last year and have used it sparingly. It seemed to work fine at first; however, many of the sealed bags in the freezer have now lost their seal and have expanded, letting in air. Now the sealer is sealing the bags without removing the air. Not good. Customer Service told me I could return it for a replacement, but it would take several weeks. It is cheaply made - so I do not recommend this sealer."
1,deeloped little hot spot in sealing element,"I bought this item 2 years ago and at first, loved it. After about a year, the heating element that seals the bags developed a hot spot in the middle of the bar, creating holes in the bags. If the purpose of the product is to vacuum out all the air for proper freezer storage, a hole created by the product doesn't quite fulfill it's job. Can't buy a replacement heating bar, so for $150 (what I paid) it's really junk. Don't buy this."
1,The worst product I have ever owned,"I am now on my third Seal-A-Meal and although Rival has replaced two defective products prior to this one, it is by far the worst product I have ever owned. I use it a moderate amount to seal bulk purchases and during late summer to freeze corn we have grown in the garden. Everytime I use the moisture setting it works for about 6-8 seals and then the heating element breaks. It is very frustrating. I would never recommend this product. It does not function properly on the moisture setting."
2,Will not buy another,"I bought one because it sealed with a wide band, sometimes you have to play with it to get it to vacuum down, sometimes it want seal. I can't get real small bags, living alone, I don't need real big bags.I tried spliting them and sealing the side and make two bags out of one. It want work. The seal is not tight enough to form a completly vacuum It. It won't vacuum down becaue the seal leaks and the sealer want come on.The next one I buy will be a different Brand.I will say when it works right it will keep food a year without any problem."
1,Don't waste your money,Have just tossed out my second VS230 sealer...both lasted just over a year and the heat strip quit working on both. Tried to purchase the strip but was told they could not sell that part and would be glad to help any other problem I had. Will NOT try another one from that manufacturer!!
2,A hidden clause : it doesn't work with common plastic bags ! Holds you dependant on them !,"Great device, but ...Several reviews - including about former models - at Amazon say it works well with common plastic bags, but ... it doesn't !!!Device is dependant of more acquisitions, and more, and more ... You will NEVER be independent from manufacturer !!! I bought a partner, not an appliance !!!Frustrating ... Felt deceived, a disgusting feeling ...Worse: manufacturer should clearly WARN costumers of this feature. It is not even within the user's guide ...Appliance works with their bags, ONLY . Period !More than worse ? I live at the other side of the Atlantic Ocean !I imported it through a courrier company, got delivery and customs handled well together, and ... Reverse procedures are virtually impossible !!!I have no words to express my frustration ...( By the way, both competing products - Rival and Food Saver - belong to the same holding company !!! )"
1,The FoodSaver sealing machine is much better,"Don't waste the money and time on this sealer. It doesn't have a lock on the lid, like the Foodsaver, when you place the bag to seal, so my hands were sore by the time I got all my sealing done. It doesn't have an instant sealer, like the FoodSaver, so you waste a lot of time trying to just seal a bag without sucking out the air.One time on the Seal A Meal was enough for me. I packed it up and sent it back and spent more money to get the FoodSaver instead. The extra money is worth it for a more superior machine."
1,BUYER BEWARE,"This is a piece of GARBAGE! Poorly designed, flimsy plastic top that you have to hold down until the sealing begins....problem is the sealing NEVER begins. Run, don't walk, from this lemon. Amazon should be ashamed of themselves for selling such trash."
2,you need 4 hands to operate,"This unit is hard to operate. It takes 2 hands to push down full force to get it to start and another 2 hands to hold the bag smooth. I must have wasted 5 bags with them not sealing and the air leaking back in within minutes. If you can afford it, I would recommend a better unit. You basically have to pre-freeze anything from ground beef and thinner or it is virtually impossible to seal."
1,bad product,"Avoid, a piece of junk. Does not work! Requires two persons to hold lid down. Bought a large amount of steaks, the product did not remove air to a vacuum state, avoid.........Jack"
2,Patchier than a jacket during the depression era,"This album, like 'Eat To The Beat' threatened to be, is, unfortunately, a pretentious show-off. Patchy but with occasional moments of glory, 'Autoamerican' attempts to boast a bold step forward in musical electicity but instead falls one superfluous step backwards. Jazz, prog. rock, country and broadway musical are all represented on the same record, but the tracks do not do their respective genres justice often enough.Best Tracks: The Tide Is High, Angels On The Balcony."
3,Ahem...,"A classic case of artists moving to a new pastures and audience criticizing them for not staying the same.Just listen to symphonic opening of ""Europe"" and you can imagine everybody looking around in surprise,because this wasn't disco pop like ""Heart of Glass"" or even one of their clever 1960s pastiches - but than,considering their genre hopping,what exactly was ""Blondie"" sound and can we ever pigeon hole them?To their defence ,""Blondie"" served audience with a two strong hits (""The tide is high"" and Rapture"") but it became obvious they were losing the steam or simply were not so interested in pursuing pop anymore. Debbie Harry sounds like a dream (as she always has) but overall the album sounds a bit pointless and uninspired. Once they reached the peak of pop charts,everything was downhill from there.Most interesting: 1920s number ""Here's looking at you"""
4,BLONDIE'S ENDEARINGLY ECLECTIC ALBUM,"I love this band for having the balls to be so all over the map on this album. Who else would have dared to do rap, reggae, country, not to mention a show tune on a rock album? No one before or since other than maybe...Blondie. Fearless."
5,SIMPLY AMAZING!!!!!,"This album, this show, the DVD....Martin, Dave, Fletch (And the surely missed Alan), they're all simply AMAZING!!!!!!!"
5,depeche mode 101,101 is really good album for people just starting to get into Depeche Mode. The first disc is live and really captures the sound that Depeche Mode has as a live band. The second disc is a greatest hits collection of the material from the 80s so it gives some of their history.
4,"They gave this ""101"" percent.","This is probably one of the best live albums I've ever heard, and I've heard it probably 500 times. It also serves as a 20 track ""Depeche Mode"" best of the 80's collection, since everything is pre-""Violator"". This includes the big hits ""People Are People"" and ""Never Let Me Down Again"", as well as the softies ""Somebody"" and ""Question Of Lust"", among others. Also here is the excellent sing-a-long closer ""Everything Counts"", which ended up on ""The Singles 86-98"" collection as well. But really every track is great, and makes ""101"" essential for any ""Depeche Mode"", or synth-rock fan. Highly recommended."
5,The best...in my life,"I have no words to describe how this music make me feel, every day I discover something GREAT about them I never feel tiredfor any of their songs...I LOVE THEM!! I LOVE THEM!! I LOVE THEM!!"
4,Recomdation,"If you didn't know about Depeche Mode and you want do it without spend a lot of money on its entire discography, take a look to 101, a very representative album of the firts decade of Depeche Mode at the top of the techo music."
1,Does not work with Windows 7,"This product refused to install on Windows 7 at all. It's the first program I've encountered that would not run at all, in any compatiblity mode."
5,it is the best!,this album is SO great and they are great live too. jason and the guys are very nice on top of it all...worth a purchase.
5,Best record of 1999,Great! the best rock album 1999. So cool songs...Best singer in the USA! this new kinda rockabilly rules! You have to get it.
4,just see them live!,"I've seen some great bands in my day. The Roads Kings are in a small group at the top. I've never seen anyone work a bass like this before. The music? Oh, the album is top notch. Great hard hitting stuff!"
1,"so, sooo not good!","I love Ray Stevens but this collection is not the original recording. Don't buy unless you don't mind not hearing what made these songs so fun in their original versions. I regret not reading the reviews before I bought this...guess I was too excited to find all these great songs in one collection. This is so, sooo NOT GOOD!"
2,New Versions!,I was so disappointed when I realized these songs weren't the same versions I grew up with. Somehow they just aren't same.
4,Enjoyable and funny,This is typical Ray Stevens with all his great funny hits. Enjoyed it very much. This has a lot of oldie but goodie Ray Stevens songs.
3,Missing many favorites,"We bought this last year before our vacation to replace the many Ray Stevens cassettes we used to bring with us. We thought we'd get most of our favorites, but found that more of our favorites were excluded than included. There were many on here that could have been replaced with better songs like People's Court, Can He Love You Have As Much As I?, Santa Claus is Watching You, The Day I Tried To Teach Charlene MacKenzie How To Drive, and others. This is ok, but not a replacement for our worn out cassettes."
2,"Sad, Sad Ray Stevens!","I have always loved Ray Steven's musical banter... however, this one's really a disappointment.. Now, technically, the audio is clean and decent.. its the CONTENT itself that's the problem...Ray re-sings these tracks- ALL of them, with the same ""I-don't-care"" ambiance throughout the set; to say, he sounds ""BORED""!The FLARE that was Ray Stevens is GONE! If you are a true fan of his works, then this box set will DISAPPOINT you. If you are merely interested in something that sounds ""digital karaoke"", then this is for you.. cause that's exactly what it is. Ray simply grabs the lyric sheets and sings-um.. SAYS the lyrics to a musical background; you can tell that he'd rather be doing something ELSE.."
2,bng,"I agree with previous reviewer. NOT ORIGINAL VERSIONS, AND SUFFERS AS A RESULT. No enthusiasm, and the music and voices dffer greatly from the originals. The Haircut song leaves out two funny stanzas, and I admit I did not have the heart to listen to much of the rest. With fond memories of the old tape versions, and wanting to indoctrinate new converts, this was not the vehicle. TOSSING THEM."
2,Very disappointed in this collection,"Ray, you did yourself an injustice with this project! I've been a Ray Stevens fan for many, many years, and was delighted to find a box set of his songs. I should have read a bit closer and maybe I would have realized that since these are not the original recordings they would sound very different. Not nearly as much fun as the originals."
2,Decent album,"I had to buy this giant album to get a few songs that weren't available on other albums. Some of the songs are worth it, but most are just repetitive and annoying."
2,RAY STEVENS BOX SET,"I WOULD HAVE GIVEN A HIGHER RATING , BUT I ONLY RECEIVED TWO (2) DISKS OF THE THREE (3) DISKS SET . I DID NOT RECEIVE DISK NUMBER 2 !!!!! IF YOU HAPPEN TO FIND MY DISC # 2 PLEASE SEND IT TO ME. THANK YOU"
3,Help me please,"I bought two of these for my kids for christmas. I have had no problems copying cds over for them to listen to, however I cannot seem to find downloadable wmas that will work on them. Please let me know a list of sites that you have used. Thank youmkdelong@ptd.net"
3,Not ready to write it off yet,"It's really cute and in expensive, holds more than enough songs for a good work out. But it keeps shutting its self off. I've made adjustments that seemed to fix the problem but it's happening again all after only a few uses. Maybe it's just a battery problem, so I'm not quite ready to write it off yet. If I can fix this issue I'll update my rating to more favorable."
3,Sound is good but it can be better,Product quality is good considering the price you pay for it. I would expense a little bit more to get a better product.
4,Why pay 10 times more for an iPod?,"This little mp3 player is great for jogging at the gym or outside. It has lots of features, and good sound quality.One downside is that the way you scroll through the menus is not intuitive at all and is pretty akward. It's not a big deal for me because I just let it play straight through and zone out. But, not a great choice if you're the kind who likes to skip around to find a song."
1,NO FM Function!,I bought this for my daughter. So far it the MP3 part seems to work fine except that the FM function it is supposed to have is not an option on it's screen! The worst part is I didnt find this out until the packages had been thrown out. (kids!) My son got a blue one of the exact same model and it seems fine.I am sure it could be fixed by reloading the firmware or upgrading it. However It is not on their site....Support does not call back. They do not email back... NOTHING. I will never buy another Macvision Product.
4,Easy to Use,"Not sure why others had a problem with this product.I bought it for my step-son and ended up using it myself.I have had no problems putting music on it, or with it overheating or anything.Without the manual I was easily able to figure out how to put music on it, and how to change from Music to FM. And the sound quality is very good. I don't know how Customer Service is, because I have not encountered any problems with the product."
3,I'm on the fence.....,"I bought this MP3 Player about a month ago. It took a while to figure out how to get it to download, but now that i know it's so easy. I'm not to impressed with the button to turn it on. I tossed it in my purse to take it home with me & it turns on to easy. By the time i got it home my battery was dead. So for the lack of ease for carrying my MP3 I give it 3 stars."
1,Not long lasting with bad sound quality.,Once you start using it you will understand why the low price: it only lasted a few months and the sound quality is horrible.
5,"Prophets,Messiahs and Cult Leaders Mad or Misguided?","This is a MUST-READ book covering all the obvious cults and leaders and less obvious ones like Jesus. Interesting details about John Nash (A Beautiful Mind---Russell Crowe) Boudicca, Joan of Arc, Hitler and every other cult leader and an explanation of how and why they were. The man who walked around London in the 1660s with a fire-filled brasier on his head warning Londoners of the Great Fire and the Plague to come.Don't miss the interesting suggestion of providing schizophrenic patients with their own virtual reality world filled with cult followers all courtesy of the Internet."
4,Good but not great,I LOVE Joanie Madden and I think that all of her music is worth listening to but I wasn't as impressed with this CD as much as Song of the Irish Whistle 1 & 2. Those CDs transport me to heaven when I listen!
5,awesome book,This is a great book. This book has easy step by step instructions on how to do magic tricks.
3,Fun but...,"Great fun but evryone playing will need to have good penmanship or the reader will struggle, which is a tip-off that it's the incorrect answer."
4,Balderdash,Product as described. A fun game. Great for quality family time and developing creativity in older children. It's nice to hear the home come alive with laughter.
3,My family doesn't like it.,"I think the game is fun, but my family doesn't seem to have enough creativity to be interested in playing it."
1,Too hard foam. Very uncomfortable,I bought this to replace one that was worn out but it is too hard. It is very uncomforatble and cover is flimsey.
3,Not entirely pleased,"This item was not advertized by size. If I had known it was as big as it is, I would not have bought it."
3,Too large for cervical pillow,"This pillow is far too large to use as a cervical pillow. I can't imagine that it would ever compress enough to allow my neck to be in a neutral position. I use it for other things. It's kind of handy, just not for the neck."
3,Larger than I thought,This foam roll is larger diameter than I thought Maybe I did not read the info correctly before I bought it.
1,not worth it,"I needed a pillow for cervical reasons.. Though this would work. Wrong. The foam indents, and stay that way, so you are not getting any support after using it for 3 or so times."
3,I kept hoping for something done right . . . in vain.,"I would say this is a movie without morals. It seemed strange to me that Ann, when she had multiple chances to go to the police, instead chose to submit to her boyfriend's increasingly dangerous threats. So, each incident put her in more and more danger. Wouldn't any normal, moral person, when they are out alone with a little girl they'd learned had been kidnapped, go to the police both to get the girl back home and for their own protection? There is a good bit of suspense, but without any reasonable resolution. I thought the ending was totally unconscionable, making the movie hardly worth wasting time watching it."

1,New Title - Old Video,"As Barney shows go this isn't a bad one but it gets a low rating because this is an old show being sold with a new name. If you want to save some money just buy a used copy of ""Barneys Beach Party"" which is the exact same show."
2,Are they kidding?,"This DVD is infuriating. Can't the menu come up right after the disc loads? I often let my child watch a video while I'm doing chores elsewhere in the house. That means I need to put the thing in the player and walk away - - not stand there waiting for Barney to talk for five minutes before the darn menu pops up. My DVD player doesn't allow me to fast forward it, either. Some other Barney videos similarly hold the parent hostage. Why is this necessary?"
2,Just another book which gives a lot of science,"I certainly agree with the other person who didn't like this book. I bought this book because I thought it would present a lot of training ideas on improving performance but I was disappointed because this book was full of scientific text which isn't fun to read, plus it requires a lot of knowledge to put the information in this book to practical use."
1,"Very confusing, only buy if you have a state rank team","I am a cross-country captain and wanted to educate myself on how to help my coach with our team. This book just helped to get me confused. ""training increases the bodys release of such hormones as aldosterone, vasopressin, and renin, causing a net retention of Na+ and H2O and thus a volume expansionof the blood and a dilutional pseudoanemia."" If you fully understand what I quoted, than this is the book for you because the whole book is basically written that way. The only advantage to this book is that on p280 there are many pictures of how to strech before a run."
1,This is a really terrible book.,"While this book does contain some accurate information...it is full of inaccurate information about real life use of DVD Studio Pro. There are even some pieces of tutorials that will cause a disc authored in the manner described to be non-functional.This is absolutely the worst technical book I have ever purchased in my entire life. I can't believe that the project manager for DVD Studio Pro from Apple is quoted on the front cover.It appears that this was a back door approach by the author to try to get a record deal for his band. If you don't believe it, check out the included DVD disc. (which at some points must be ejected from the drive and restarted because the author forgot to program it to return to the menu)"
3,DVD Studio Pro Bible a Useful Reference Tool,"I haven't read Macworld's DVD Studio Pro Bible cover to cover, but I do often use it as a reference tool; quite handy for looking up specific information or answering questions that arise along the way.If you get stuck during a DVD authoring project, this Bible is likely to have the information you need. For anybody not yet adept at DVD authoring, I recomend this book to get you started."
1,Impractical and messy...,Some of the concept is just impractical and don't work in real life especially in an environment with extreme politics. I still hold firm to the concept that people are slow to adapt and exercise resistance when it comes to changes. The flow of the book is messy and I gave up after reading about half the book. I tried hard but just could not appreciate this book.
3,Miniature,"HelloThe 8th Habit book was ok,I had order this book thinking that it was the big book.It was so funny that my daughter put it on her face book. I have had great result from ordering my books by amazon.com , I thank God for this website. Thanks Deborah"
2,Kind of Cheating... Sorry,"Hi,Once I recieved the book, I found it almost 30 or 40 pages and its size not more than 4X5 cm. The nice thing that it came with a hard cover. I bought it along with the 7 habits book. actually if you made the 7 habits with a hard cover it would be better. But for sure... for money saving purposes you did not do so. on the other hand, when the book was presented on the site, it seemed to be having a size similar to the 7 habits one. I like the book of 8 habits and I respect it and it's author as well, but I suggest to add something regarding the sizes and -at least- nomber of pages on the sold books. I liked the idea of taking the opinions online. sorry if I used some words you did not like. as along with ending, have my sincere respects.Hytham Abu-LatifaDubai - UAE"
3,"Totally missed this was ""miniature""",Except for the fact that I was laughing so hard when I opened the package and found out I ordered the miniature there is nothing wrong with this product. It is very small and easy to lose at this size (fits in your palm).
3,This a small mini- book,Just be aware. This is a very small mini book. It is not a large regular book. It is like a miniature pocket size.
3,slightly mislead,"I unfortunately overlooked the fact that this is the miniature version and would not have paid the price for it if I had noticed, having said that there are some good points in it."
2,What the...?,"I will be honest. I haven't opened this book yet. The problem is that I didn't realize I was ordering a ""mini version"" of an actual book. I was concerned that this might happen (because it's happened before), but the online sample seemed to reflect the contents of a whole and actual grown-up sized book--unabridged. Arrived in the mail as a 3"" mantle piece of snippets and whatnots. I feel bamboozled. Not the first false description of a Stephen Covey book. Doe!"
3,Don't mess with Mister In Between.,"This is an album of Dr. John performing standards. Standards with a New Orleans influence. It's a good album, tastefully done. Fans of ""The Night Tripper"" should enjoy it."
2,Just pretty bad as a comedy goes?,"Strange low budget Sci Fi comedy that when it isn't predictable is somewhat boring. The cloning is a joke from a bad B movie.In one of the starting scenes Keaton's make up is bad and hekooks like he has a bad skin disease? Keaton's acting is good on the four distinct personalities, but the dialog doesn't make use of the comedy situations. MacDowell mainly does sexy and reads her lines.These two deserve a better written comedy that has more believable action and dialog. My conclusion is that it was a production line movie with bad oversight and quality control: a Hollywood screw up."
1,$5+ and still no DVD seen,"I purchaced this item that required a small shipping fee. It arrived intacted but didn't have a movie on it. I tried it on 4 different DVD players in our home. I had to pay an additional fee to return it. Therefore $5+ on shipping fees and NO MOVIE. I will NEVER purchase from this dealer again, perhaps Amazon in general due to other issues with it's sellers. I have never had an issue until now and I am VERY dissapointed."
3,"Multiplicity - ""It's OK""","I like most of Michael Keaton's movies especially Batman, Batman Returns, and Beetlejuice. I thought this would be pretty great too compared to the others. Don't get me wrong its not terrible. It just could have been way better. Basically Michael plays an over worked construction executive who is trying to balance work and his family. He clones himself when me meets some weird scientist who explains it all. Then everything pretty much gets obvious from there. The problem is they didnt seem to stretch out anything with the plot. The guy has clones and the most that happens is they're at home taking turns chilling with the wife and he or the ""clone"" instead gets fired. Nothing much else. Its silly here and there but could have been way better. You'll laugh mostly for the clones and their different personalities. There's the cocky one, the nice/effeminate one, and a ""slow"" one."
4,Cloning humour,"I had seen this movie a long time ago and watched it again yesterday. It was still as funny as I remembered it.Acting is great, both Michael Keaton and Andy MacDowell. The idea of cloning self to reduce workload is tempting, but most great ideas don't work too well. There is always a glitch as seen in this movie.Prepare not to take anything seriously and prepare to have a good laugh."
4,From England,"Well, the price was great - BUT the DVD was in the European format and wouldn't play here in the USA. What a waste of time. We bought it again later at Fry's. It is a great movie."
2,Format Restrictions,"I think I now understand why the particular DVD I purchased was less expensive than others who offered the same DVD. The format it was recorded in does not allow it to play on most all DVD players. I have several players, and I cannot play it on a couple of them. Therefore, I am not satisfied."
4,Multiplicity,This movie has always been one of my favorite comedies of all time. It's all comedy!!! If you like Michael Keaton then you will enjoy 4 of him.
4,classic keaton,"everybody knows this movie. if you enjoy watching actors display a wide range of their skills, you'll probably enjoy this flick. michael keaton plays at least half of the scenes entirely by himself, albeit as four different people. check it out."
5,Hilarious movie~!,"This movie is just plain hilarious from start to finish. No need to read reviews folks, just go rent it. If you didnt find it funny, you seriously need to feel for a pulse in your arm."
4,"A good movie but maybe a ""little"" surreal",Enjoyed the movie for what it was a comedy. A little over the top fiction wise but otherwise a good movie for someone looking for a few good laughs.
5,One of my favorites,Michael Keaton gives an underrated performance in this comedy. Each character is brought to life and given distinct personality traits that make you love them. GREAT movie!
5,So well acted. Such a cute movie.,Michael Keaton playing against 4 different versions of himself is a hilarious set up. I think it is just as good as Eddie Murphy's multiple character scenes in the Nutty Professor. This is a light feel good romantic even comedy.
1,DVD,Ordered thinking it would be usable. It was a UK version. And not readable on dvd player. Could only wat h on computer after resetting computer.
1,Multiplicity,When I finally received this DVD it didn't work in any of my DVD players. I sent multiple messages to the seller with no response. I now own a DVD that cannot be viewed and the seller never tried to contact me.
1,Don't buy dvd's from overseas vendors,I do not want to give any stars. I would have to reconfigure my player for the DVD because it was set up for european players. That should have been explained to me before I purchased. That is a mistake I will not repeat.
1,No delivery,"Purchased this item July 15,2006 and have not received it yet, have looked at where's my stuff and it shows it somewhere at a post office. Don't know why it would take over a month unless it was sent pony express, even then it would of been here by now. E-mailed Amazon and received no help. A terrible experience so far."
4,Multiplicity,"It's an old movie, but it is totally hilarious. Michael Keaton plays five parts and is funnier than ever."
4,Poses an interesting scenario,"This is definitely an original premise for a film, and the casting was dead on in selecting Michael Keaton, as he puts his comedic talent to excellent use in Multiplicity. The movie presents an interesting perspective of cloning and what may occur in its aftermath. Utter hilarity ensues as each clone displays unique personality traits - one is a tough armchair-quarterback type, another a male Martha Stewart, and the fourth - a copy of a copy - needs to be seen to be believed. The film was co-written and directed by Harold Ramis, and as far as comedy is concerned you can't go wrong with most of his work. The script holds together pretty well considering that it was a four person collaboration. My favorite scene was probably the one where Andie MacDowell is in the mood and encounters each of the clones - that scene is worth the price of admission. This movie deserved more of a push than it received - it's worth checking out if you are a fan of any of the participants."
1,haven't received my movie,"I purchased multiplicity the weekend after thanksgiving and still have not received it! Obviously i'm not happy with the service, as long as i receive my product SOON then thats all i care about"
1,would not play,"This product would not play when I got it. I am VERY DISAPPOINTED with this product!!! I would recommend buying a new product, not used!!"
3,movie,Did not realize this was an international dvd. Can't watch it. Not sure how to rate something I can't watch & was my fault for not reading the small print
2,not impressed,I purchased this tie for my son. He wears a tie to work daily. This Navy blue tie was not dark enough to match his navy blue uniform. After a few days the zipper broke. I offered to order another one for him he told me not to waste my money.
5,to lynn,"Let it Bleed seems to me more like its poking fun at Let it Be than trying to rip it off. Not to mention Let it Bleed is a whole lot better a song, in my opinion. And Sitars, gotta be copying the Beatles if you use one of those, that's why all of India is rocking the John Lennon haircut. I always found the Stones to be a whole lot better than the Beatles...and considering that they didn't implode after John Lennon's death, I'd say they've got some of their own talent.This album is great. Though as many people have said, not their greatest album. If you like the Stones though, even a little, I would recommend buying this."
5,You CAN rip it onto a PC!,"One of the Stones' very best. And yes, it along with the other new Stones Reissues can be ripped. Download the free version of MusicMatch Jukebox and it will work fine. Disclaimer alert: This is only to be used for legal purposes, mind you. Otherwise great sound, and great material."
5,I was blown away,"I have a SACD player, but even the CD layer is great on this CD. I bought 3 RS remasters, and while playing Beggers in the car (CD layer), I decided to stop at another store and buy High Tide and Green Grass. I will buy more.Right now, I'm having difficulty deciding which is my favorate of the remasters. It's between Let It Bleed, Beggers Banquet, and High Tide, Green Grass. Aftermath (US)is recorded well, but some of the cuts are not that interesting to me.I have Beggers in vinyl. I prefer this remaster.For a week now, I've been playing the Stones in my car, on my computer, and at home on my SACD based Home Theater System. I can't get enough of these remasters."
5,A CLASSIC! THE STONES IN TOP FORM AGAIN!,"The Stones started to really shine with this album. It was the peak of their creative genius! ""Beggar's Banquet"",""Let It Bleed"",""Sticky Fingers"" and ""Exile On Main Street"" should be in everyone's top 100 albums of all time! Though this album is more acoustic than most efforts by the Stones,there are some classic jammers including Sympathy for the Devil, Street Fighting Man and the forgotten Stray Cat Blues!"
5,A true Rolling Stones epic,"I bought this CD a while ago, and am very satisfied with it.All the greats are here ""Salt Of The Earth"", ""Sympathy For The Devil"", ""Jigsaw Puzzle"" and ""Street Fighting Man"", IMHO.I love the guitar solo in ""Sympathy..."", the slide guitar in ""Jigsaw..."" and the use of mandolins and such on ""Factory Girl"".Just let me say now, that no Rolling Stones, or even music collection is complete without it."
2,So very overrated!,"I am a huge music fan, and yes, I am a stones fan of their golden era (64-72), but I am at a loss as to what is wonderful about this album.Sympathy for the devil is mediocre at best, and the rest ranges from ok(street fighting man, no expectations, salt of the earth), to horrible(dear doctor),to so-so(jigsaw puzzle, stray cat blues).I checked the charts, and this album got as high as no 5 on the charts, and stayed in the top 40 for a mere 13 weeks... street fighting man never was able to crack the top 40! I would recommend a number of stones albums over this one... this is so,so overrated... now, I think I will go listen to sticky fingers, or maybe decembers children!"
2,What a waste of money!,"I asked for this album as a Christmas gift because of all the reviews saying it was one of the Stone's best. I could not have been more disappointed. I understand the Stones have been a raw band from day one, but this is rediculous. The sound quality of the recording absolutely sucks! No matter how hard they tried, The Stones could never out shine The Beatles"
2,Beggars Banquet: a classic because of Rolling Stone...,"Heiled as ""a classic of delta blues"", I am quite disappointed about the quality of the music. This is a PRODUCT of the Rolling Stones, so what they made must be a classics, expectally when the stuff are acceptable... but I think there are whole lot of Blues Players made much more inspiring stuff (let's say John Mayall, Peter Green, etc.) and both technically and musically they are far beyond the Rolling Stones. The lyrics are controversial at their time, but just stupid slogans nowadays. Sorry Rolling Stones fans, this review is for prog. rock lovers or Krautrock lovers. Nevertheless, ""No expectation"" is a good song that worth me give a 2 star for the WHOLE album."
3,Overrated,"Slightly. I admit it is decidedly better than Satanic but evidently weaker than Let It Bleed. I like the old LP Cover Better, it's much classier (The one where they copy The Beatles white Album cover, except they use script - Whoopdedoo). They always copied the Beatles in some way (Satanic cover), use of sitar(Paint It, Black), Let It Be-answer-Let It Bleed, etc etc,,,,too much to metion here. It is the only thing I don't like about The Stones, Jagger's relentless jealosy towards the genius of the Beatles. He hated being number 2. People do not recognize this fact enough. They always kept a close eye on what The Beatles were doing so they could plan their next artistic move and follow their lead. I hope he is reading this review too."
2,Uh.no,If oyu want real revolutionary music and true artists that changed music forever without trying to be something they're not listen to the Beatles you sad sad children.
2,"NOT A COMPLETE DUD,BUT CLOSE","IT'S ALWAYS AMAZED ME HOW PEAPLE CAN RAVE ABOUT THIS ALBUM AND ACTUALLY COMPARE IT TO ANY OF THE GREAT ALBUMS THAT TRULY BELONG IN THE ROCK AND ROLL HALL OF FAME!FIRST,YOU HAVE SYMPATHY FOR THE DEVIL,WHICH GETS OLD AFTER THE THIRD HOO-HOO. NO EXPECTATIONS IS OKAY,BUT THEN COMES DEAR DOCTOR WITH MICKS FAMOUS HEE-HAW SINGING! PRODIGAL SON IS A HOPELESS CASE,AS IS FACTORY GIRL. STREET FIGHTING MAN IS OKAY,BUT AGAIN, WHEN PUT OUT AS A SINGLE IN 68, IT DIDN'T EXACTLY BURN UP THE CHARTS.(IT NEVER MADE THE TOP 40).STRAY CAT BLUES AND SALT OF THE EARTH ARE SO-SO. IV'E EVEN TRIED TO PLAY THIS AT PARTIES,AND IV'E BEEN TOLD TO PUT ON SOMETHING ELSE,SO AS FAR AS THIS BEING A GREAT ALBUM,GO FIGURE.BUY SOMETHING ELSE(THE BEATLES WHITE ALBUM -RELEASED THE SAME YEAR,COMES TO MIND.THATS THE ONE EVERYBODY WANTED TO HERE AT PARTIES)"
4,The best Stones starts with the next album.,"Sympathy for the Devil is a great song. So is No Expectations. And if you love rockabilly they might all be great songs to you so get this one. But the best of the Stones, in my humble opinion, begins with(for some odd reason)Brian's death (Let It Bleed)and lasts until Some Girls. Only in those albums do they truly merge pop-rock and blues into an honest, original and powerful style. Perhaps it took the pain of Brian's death. Who knows? Nonetheless, this is a very good album. Just not quite as great as they can do."
5,Why Review?,"It is hard to argue that this is not the Stones finest (I love ""Let It Bleed"" and most Mick Taylor Stones.) I won't."
4,the stones beggars banquet 1968 classic!!,"the rolling stones beggar,s banquet is another one of the best albums made in the 60,s.!!beggar,s banquet was released toward the end of 1968 and was a return to more of the stones trademark sound after satanic majesties in 67.1967 was a hard year for the stones it was a year of drug busts, that some believe the british press set the stones up for.because satanic majesties got mixed reviews,the stones realized the next album-beggars banquet needed to be a return to form and they did this very well, and around the time they released beggars banquet the stones decided to tape a t.v. special called rock and roll circus at the end of 68. some of the guests on this special were john lennon,the who,eric clapton jethro tull and others..however for me the great cuts on banquet are;sympathy for the devil,street fighting man,stray cat blues and no expectations!!if you are a stones fan grab this!!!"
2,Great Content But What's Up with the SACD?,"I am currently using a DVD player hooked up to my stereo to play my CDs. This CD was not playable on my DVD player. I was able to burn a cdr of it on my pc and the cdr was playable on the DVD player, so it is not a total loss. The musical content of this CD is excellent, and I consider it an essential release for any stones fan. I don't consider it the best stones record, but it is definitely in the top 5."
2,SACD limits use.,"Great music, one of the greatest rock record ever released. I bought it to replace my original LP. But I am disappointed, nontheless, because I cannot load this disk onto my iPod. It plays, as advertised, on my CD player at home. I suppose it will play on a SACD player, if I ever get one. But it will NOT play on my Mac G4 Powerbook. I use my iPod to play my music when I am walking to work in and in my car. I thought about returning the disk, but I will keep it. However, I will not buy another disk with this format."
3,SACD version of Beggar's Banquet,"Ok, Stones fans,Most of us raved about the music on this cd. Face it, it was during the ""Classic Stones era"". However, with regards to the SACD, there is virtually no sound quality difference/improvement between the digitally remastered cd and the SACD. (The goal here (with SACD) was to give it the original vinyl sound that may have been lost when transferring to cd.) If you have the original or remastered cd version, keep it. Don't bother picking up the SACD!!! In fact, don't purchase a SACD unless it is in multi-channel 5.1 or 6.1 surround sound."
5,5 stars isn't enough!,What can you say about this album!?!This is simply one of the ten greatest albums ever made.This needs to be in your collection.
4,just 1 song...,"""Street fightin man"" makes it all worth while IMHO....such a great tuneBut the rest is good if not great at times....they dont make it like this anymore"
2,pass on this!,"This is an unusual Russian release; notice the Cyrillic wring on the back. I played this on my computer (Windows7/media player), and the listed track titles are totally wrong! Really, really weird!!! After a lot of head scratching, I found that the track listing is from a different CD altogether, a 1991 compilation release called The USA collection/flashpoint??? I think any player that shows the song titles will show the same problem. I think media player gets it's info from the Allmusic website.Fortunately, the listing on the back of the CD case is correct. The sound quality is quite good, I've even noticed small things I didn't notice before, and I've listen to this album dozens of times. Except for tracks 1 & 7, on which Mick's vocals aren't as loud as usual. They seem to be lost in the background. Unless the extra tracks are important to you, I'd pass on this (wish I would have) and get the 2002 Abkco remaster. Just my $00.02 !"
5,A true Stones fan says not their absolute best,"Yes, 'Beggar's Banquet' is perfect. But, it doesn't have the spicy naughtiness of 'Sticky Fingers' or as intimate a feel as 'Exile on Main St.' Where 'Exile' is a collection of seperate but equal blues songs, the songs near the end of 'Banquet' kind of run together, just a little. But, so what? It is still better than any album any other band has ever released. I challenge anyone to argue the merits of ""Factory Girl"" or ""Jigsaw Puzzle."" One note to fans, though. Much like 'Tattoo You,' this album does sound a little bit better on vinyl. I don't know why, it just does."
5,Not a Stones Fan,"I was not a Rolling Stones fan...until I got this album. I just bought it to have ""Sympathy for the Devil"", which I liked. I had always avoided the Rolling Stones, they were kind of finished by the time I got old enough to buy records (late 80s) and I knew nothing about them. They are great! I've bought Exile on Main Street, Beggar's Banquet, Let It Bleed, and December's Children. In my opinion, Beggar's Banquet is by far the best. One of the best album's I've ever heard - I never get tired of it."
5,The beginning of a great Stones era.,"Beginning with this album, The Stones would put together a string of four consecutive studio albums that would be the best of their careers and four of the best in rock and roll history. All four made Rolling Stone magazine's Top 100 albums of all time back in 1987.Every track on this album is excellent and shows The Stones becoming even more musically creative than they ever had before. ""Sympathy for the Devil"" is fine and it's one of the more easily recognized songs on the album but there are songs just as good and even better here. ""No Expectations"" is a melancholy, primarily acoustic song and ""Dear Doctor"" is an offbeat, amusing offering. My personal favorites include ""Parachute Woman"", ""Jig-Saw Puzzle"", ""Prodigal Son"" (basically an all acoustic version of the parable that Christ told in Luke 15:11-31), and ""Stray Cat Blues"", the most rockin' song on the album. If you're just now getting into The Stones, this is a great place to start."
5,I just rediscovered this,"I bought this when it came out in 68, but I RETURNED it to the store because my 15 year old ears couldn't stand most of the country tracks. There were only two outright rockers: Sympathy and Street, at least to me back then. Country music seemed like the lamest possible thing to me then and to hear Mick's ridiculous attempts to sound country only added to my disdain. Flash forward to today. I finally listened to this again and, of course, was blown away. Not only did the country rock sound fine, but I was totally taken by some of Charlie's hard drumming on Parachute Woman and maybe Jigsaw Puzzle, which I didn't appreciate back in the day either. Oh well. Live and learn. I've jumped on the bandwagon for one of the best Stones' records ever."
3,You get what you pay for...,"I've purchased comparable replacement batteries from other retailers that were the same price but the housing of the battery was MUCH better quality. This is plastic not aluminum. The fit is poor, with sharp protruding edges. The only reason this battery is passable is that it appears to hold a good charge. I'd recommend spending a little extra time finding one that's actually aluminum."
5,Lithium Ion Laptop Battery for Apple Powerbook G4,"I just knew I would be without my computer for at least 10 days, due to the Christmas rush. After finding what I needed at Amazon, I placed the order with confidence that it would be exactly as advertised. I was pleasantly surprised when 4 days later, I had my computer up & running. Thanks!"
3,Not much was learned,"This was an enjoyable meander but for a book that takes place in large parts in a Mithraic Temple, one would think there would be more about that cult or religion or that the author might have seen some opportunities to utilize Mithraism to more substantial effect. Not going to happen, so if you're hoping for that, go elsewhere. As a detective story this delivers somewhat but you can find that in other places and often it will be better done."
5,Blast from the Past,The melodious sounds of the Ramblers provide with a taste of hi-life at its best. A must-own for any serious collector hi-life music from it golden era.
4,A graphically interesting work not bogged down in history.,"Anyone intersted in the graphic stylism, the stark imagery, the sometimes disturbing and sometimes hilarious generalizations made in American Propaganda during World War Two should check out this book. It contains many posters that I've not seen in print before, but unfortunately leaves many others out. From an academic, historical perspective the documentation and historical explanations for the U.S. propaganda machine are too brief. Still, the poster reproductions are fantastic, mostly in color. I would also reccomend Anthony Rhodes ""Propaganda: The Art of Persuasion"" for a look at other countries' propaganda from the same time period."
2,"well-intentioned, but...","Children's letters manages to be both earnest and artificial, like the soundtrack to an extended Barney episode. Children are singing, but it's too often painfully obvious that a well-meaning grown-up is putting the words in their mouths. One or two songs manage to capture the spirit of the singer, especially a teenaged boy's song about the baseball cap he associates with his estranged father... but one trip through this disc will be enough for most listeners."
2,Sockets are a VERY tight fit.,These socket holders seem well built. However the are very tight. Just getting the sockets onto the rail was a pain. I understand that you don't want it to be too loose but I've used other socket holders that are not as tight and they work just fine. Maybe they will loosen up over time.
5,Good Tasting Healthy Family Food,"I've had this cookbook since in came out around 15 years ago, and am needing another copy because it's so well used! Many tasty but healthy recipes. The best ""health food"" cookbook I own."
2,Terrible!,"OK, this is what I don't understand, Starrcade is supposed to be WCW's best PPV of the year. So why the hell were Norman Smiley vs. Prince Iaukea, Saturn vs. The Cat, and Scott Norton and Brian Adams vs. Fit Finlay and Jerry Flynn on it? Could somebody explain that? The only high spots here are the luchador three way match, and the ending of the DDP vs. Giant match."
2,yet another lousy Starcade.,There were only three good matches. Two luchador matches and the main event with Nash and Gold-Bore. If you are a Ric Flair mark then this tape will suck for you. Rent it but don't buy.
1,Just Awful!,"I totally agree with everyone that reviewed it. It desperatly needed better matches. The Main Event was Goldberg vs. Kevin Nash. This match was alright but it could of been better. And it had DDP vs. The Giant which was a good match. The Ric Flair vs. Eric Bischoff match was kind of stupid. The Konnan vs. Chris Jericho match was alright. The best match on it was the Triangle match with Kidman vs. Juventud Guerrera vs. Rey Misterio Jr, That was the best match on it. But the rest Sucked! Take my advice, I ordered it on PPV and I rented it. This tape is a total rip off! Its definetly not worth 50 dollars. This Starrcade really puts the Starrcade legacy to shame. WCW had all this hype for the main event for nothing and the undercade was horrible! You should take that 50 dollars and buy a couple good WCW Video's from the early 90's."
1,$h!t,who ever booked these matches can screw himself it sucked i orderd it on ppv and wasted 30 f'n dollars
1,What happened,"This is one of the worst videos I've ever bought. A few matches are good like the first few, with kidman wrestling twice but the rest of the matches are pretty weak, all I have to say is Fit Finely, who's booking this, oh thats right it was Kevin Nash back then, which brings us to the main event. What a suprise Nash takes the belt from Goldberg, officially starting the downward spiral in Goldberg's career. Worse yet is Nash's effort ""his"" big match, its like he's on no-dose. Common Nash show some pride in your work. What a lousy video, if you want WCW in its prime form, get the 98 Halloween Havoc, at least DDP has testicular fortitude even if he's 46."
4,Any B-52s fan needs this in their cd collection,"If you are a B-52s fan you need to get this cd as well. I actually enjoy this more than their self-titled album & Wild Planet. ""Dry County"" is a bomb track. The album goes used for $0.01. At that price you can't say no!"
3,Hop on the cosmic wagontrain,"This was the B-52's best selling album. ""Love Shack"" and ""Roam"" are great songs. ""Deadbeat Club"", ""Bushfire"", ""Channel Z"" and ""Follow Your Bliss"" are good songs. The rest of the songs are just okay, in my opinion. Long time fans of the group will probably get more out of the album than I did."
4,Clever,"Years ago I probably would have never given this band a chance. Their oddball style would have drained my last nerve. However, as a skilled musician, I found myself playing and singing Love Shack with a very congenial group of people. I also recall liking ROAM in spite of the unusually arrangements. All these factors brought out curiosity and I borrowed this CD recently.After a few listens, I have grown to be very fond of this recording. At one time Fred Schenider's voice might have truly annoyed me. But now his style fits in very will with the strong sounding female vocalists. Captivating instrumental support, intricate group harmonies, and cool special effects make this CD a consistenty good one. Each tune brings something different and special to the table. I guess its a certain sophistication that one gets as they open their minds. I am glad that I keep such a perspective."
2,"Great music, but can't import into iTunes","The music on this disc is worth at least 4 stars, but the ""anti-piracy"" features are preventing me from slurping this into iTunes."
4,The Best of the B-52s,"You got to pity the B-52s a little bit. They finally scored a smash breakthrough album featuring a fistful of hit singles in 1989, only to get buried two years later under the Nirvana avalanche that made their music seem trite and hokey by comparison. Enough time has passed since then, however, that we can now see ""Cosmic Thing"" for what it was, the best album from what was essentially a singles band.The hit singles are all first rate, including radio (and MTV) staples ""Roam,"" ""Deadbeat Club,"" ""Love Shack"" and ""Channel Z."" They all feature the band's strengths, danceable beats, humorous lyrics and their unique brand of boy-girl vocalizing. True, these songs are so lightweight that they practically float off on their own, but its hard to deny their charm. The filler material that makes up the rest of the disc is adequate, without any real clunkers.Overall, a period piece that ought to be on the playlist at any 80s nostalgia party."
2,Was really looking forward to this one,"The original CD sounds better to me than this one. I did a pretty in depth comparison on a reference system. The original CD has the correct ""weight"" on instruments while the re-master does not. It seems like part of the lower mids were scooped out."
5,Topaz.....,"""Topaz"" is my favorite song off of this album. It's got a great flow to it. The lyrics are just interesting. ""Channel Z"" is another really good one on here too. ""Love Shack"" I like, but it just got overplayed at the time. Great album overall. Can't forget ""Deadbeat Club"" great song as well."
5,"THE B52S MAY HAVE GROWN UP, WELL NOT REALLY.","Happy Happy Joy Joy!! This is the crazy-cool, and long-awaited, follow-up to 1986's ""Bouncing Off the Satellites"". I'm glad they had Don Was back to help produce this much appreciated reminder of what pop music is all about. A definite party/beach/driving/cleaning the house/etc.,et al. disc. Their best song ever is here! ""Dry County"", rivals my old favs ""Dirty Back Road"" and ""Ain't It a Shame"". ""Love Shack"", ""Roam"", and ""Channel Z"" speak for themselves, but ""Topaz"", ""Bushfire""<--total go-go song, and ""Deadbeat Club"" are great cuts, as well. ""Follow Your Bliss"" is a Jetta commercial before Jetta's were cool. Buy it and enjoy yourself without remorse."
5,Cosmic Thing is a classic,Cosmic Thing is such a fun CD. I have fond memories of dancing around to it with my son on my shoulders years ago.The price of the CD on Amazon was a steal! Not to mention that I got a $1 off my next MP3 download.
5,FUN!,"This record is one of the most ultimate party albums of the century! Lots of dancible cuts like ""Cosmic Thing"", ""Love Shack"", ""Junebug"", and ""Channel Z"". This record was their comeback album, released in 1989, yet it still sounds good today. Put it on, turn it up, and PARTY!"
5,Deadbeat's club!,Reminds me of my uncle playing this cd every summer! Great album! Fast shipping and high qaulity cd with jewel case.
2,Not what I expected,"Growing Up FastI was somewhat disappointed with this book-it started to feel tedious after about a third of the way through and I easily could have put it down. For good. ""Random Family"", on the other hand, was awesome-a book I truly couldn't put down. This book was just too much of the same story after story and I did not truly care about anyone that was being written about. Just too much of the same thing in each chapter. Not recommended."
2,Good but Extreme,"This book has a lot of hadith but gives to much credit to some extreme hadith and ideas. I have a different opinion now of the writer, who I believe supports terroism. ""A call to Jihad"" is stepping across the line for some one who is translating Hadith. He should have kept his opinions out of the book.I cannot say Hadith should be given any credit because it was written by a bunch of ""Persians"" and Quaraish nobles who wanted to hyjack Islam for their own wicked purposes. This book is not about true Islam."
4,The Masterwork,"The Bunnymen at the top of their form. Sawing Indian strings, the best deconstruction of pop love songs ever sung, passing references to ""The Duchess of Malfi"", on and on. A decade and a half later, it's still mind-blowing stuff. Much better than Julian Cope."
3,Got them on MTV,"""Porcupine"" got the Bunnymen on MTV in the early '80's with the video of ""The Cutter"", which remains the standout track on the album. ""Back of Love"" is also a ""Best of..."" track, deserving inclusion on any retrospective of the band. ""Never Stop - Discoteque"", their follow-up stand alone single after ""Porcupine"", is a great inclusion as a bonus track. The digital version is well worth having and the artwork is great, but other than the 3 tracks I mentioned it's still a hard listen. 3 stars and a must-have if you're a fan of the band. If not, skip to a best of collection."
3,Porcupines got a few,"Few Highlites here, ""Cutter"", ""The Back Of Love""...More keyboards and Lots of Shankar's Strings...Not as good as Crocodiles. First Timer to the Bunnymen? Go Crocodiles."
4,A fine transitional album,"Porcupine was my favorite Bunnymen album for the longest time. The power of the opening tracks ""The Back of Love"" and ""The Cutter"" made an immediate impact on me. It's clear that bands like The Doves have been listening to this album and ""Heaven Up Here"" quite a bit.The only bonus tracks here that was previously released on the boxed set is ""Gods Will Be Gods"" (Alternate version)and the discotheque version of ""Never Stop"". It's a pretty powerful album and sets up the stage for the band's next development with the powerful, moody and magnificent ""Ocean Rain"".The sound is exceptional and puts the previously issued CD to shame. The liner notes are also very good as well although they do recap some of the points from the boxed set. Lyrics? Well you'll need to wait for the next reissue for those."
4,Great Toy,"I purchased this during the summer for my 5 year old son who is a crane fanatic, and he has enjoyed it ever since. My only problem with the crane is the string is beginning to fray, hence the 4 stars! Playmobil has out done themselves, this crane is very realistic and a lot of fun to play with."
5,My 4 year old can't get enough!,My 4 year old loves this crane. He plays with it daily and it is very popular among his friends. He actually saw a real-life yellow crane exactly like it in design. This toy is designed to be a crane that can be moved to the worksite and then assembled in 3 easy steps. My son's frequent question: where is the truck to pull it? Maybe next year.
4,old version of VS but still useful for simple projects,"My projects are only simple: create photo slideshows with background music, titles, credits, and some interesting transition effects.I have Windows Movie Maker (WMV), but can't use it to burn AVI to DVD so I bought this VS7 primarily for that function and it works great.It's simple enough IMO to use although WMV feels easier for makingphoto slideshow projects. Got the software for $8.50 with S&H; so it's worth it for the simple projects."
4,Sneak preview,When it comes to user friendly video editing software these folks have done it well. This version especially is exceptional and fits any and all video editing needs.
3,Decent but not as Good as the Other Series,As a whole this series is not as good as Tenchi Muyo or Tenchi Universe but is still good. Episode 10: Ryoko's Big Date is one exception. I would get this disk just for it. The series as a whole is not up to par with the rest of the other series but Ep 10 is possibly one of my favorites of all the series so I would get this just for that episode.
1,Wasted Money,"The book is confusing, does not outline the important topics and only three out of 16 or so chapters are on substantive testing."
5,Charming and Inspiring,"This book was given to me and when I opened it, it was like stepping back into another era, I was surprised to see how recently it was printed. I am crazy about this form of illustration and am always looking for old books in this style in second hand bookstores. What I love is that it gives me lists of books illustrated by each of these artists so it has opened up a whole new doorway to my ongoing bookhunt. It is a lovely book that has inspired me to dust of my sketchbooks and rediscover childhood as it aught to be."
3,Good information,"I gave this book 3 stars because of the way it is organized and the lack of clarity to many of the illustrations. Sternberg's books may be lacking some vocabulary, but they are much easier to read.I have a variety of sign books as I am teaching my children signing as a second language. I can't recommend one book or author over any others...they all have their good points and negative ones. I think you have to take a look at a book and see if its drawings and organization make sense to your style of learning."
4,GOOD START,"I took a class at my church and this was the bok they taught from. Once you understand the concept of what ASL is, I don't think you will have a probem. Although the class is over, I plan on continuing studying and I will also purchase some more books for my learning."
5,Signing Illustrated,"I thought this was a really great deal, and the instructions for signing are in detail, it makes it so easy. Thank you!"
3,"It's good, but...","Its strength is its straightforward presentation of the signs and review ""quizzes"" at the end of each chapter. It's great for quickly learning the vocabulary.Its weakness is that it has almost no information on grammar or sentence structure. It's not inadequate, it's absent. I'm definitely going to need to supplement this with another source on the grammar of sign language."
4,Signing Illustrated,I've been learning from this book for about three months. The illustrations are easy to understand and follow.I would buy it again.
3,just ok,"This book is not ASL as other reviewers have noted, it's signed english! I've taken a few ASL courses and now I am using this book for a signing course (not pure ASL). The teacher has to review each chapter before we study it because there are modification and corrections to many sign forms or synonyms. The book does include a nice amount of vocabulary and it is organized by categories. The vocabulary words learned in this book are not reinforced with any type of actual language/sentence formation. I would use this book more as a dictionary instead of a learning tool."
1,Like learning to read Chinese,"This book has a lot of signs, but they're organized by category instead of usefulness. There are 300 words that most people can use to get by in English. This book has 1500 words, but the useful ones are scattered throughout. I don't need to know Kangaroo or Trombone before I know words like ""like,"" how to tell time, interrogatory words, etc. This is one of the most frustrating books I have ever tried to learn from, and I'm pretty good at languages. There is no grammar, and many of the signs are British instead of American. It may be a good ""dictionary"" but it isn't a good basic text."
3,Learning Signing,Excellent book for looking up words. You must know how to sign (grammer). the pictures make it easy to follow.
2,So-so,"I found it difficult to locate the word I was wanting to sign. Alphabetical order works for me, not catgories like this book."
5,Signing Illustrated The Complete Learning Guide,I just love this book. we have stared a Signing Choir at our church and it shows in great detail the movments for all the words we have looked up. It is so good my 8 yr. old Grandaughter can do it too.
4,worked well for class,"Bought this book for an art history class. It actually was a really nice book. Well written, beautiful color images. I kept the book even after the class ended."
5,This One was Amazed,"I started reading this book with much trepidation as I knew the author at Ottawa University. However I quickly forgot about that connection as I was drawn into the story. For me, the beginning was fascinating. I loved the rich background ""gossip"" of William's character. I also enjoyed the arduous journey that eventually brought them to Brittsville (very loosely based on Simpson), Kansas. (My father was a pastor of the Simpson Church <there's just one now> for over 2 decades so I know the area.) The author succeeded in showing me how a person could choose to stay in an abusive relationship and all that involves. Dealing with good lovers/bad husbands, poverty and loneliness, Annie perserves and I fell in love with her character. I would like to know how much of the epilogue is factual. In conclusion, this was a really delightful book and I've already promised to share it with my cousin. (And I agree- it would make a great Hallmark-type movie)"
4,A feast for the senses,"I love the images conjured up in this book! Being from Kansas myself, it was particularly gratifiying to see our habitat described with such beauty and a sense of the awesome vastness of our terrain. The people in this book are real and it was good to come to know them over a lifetime. This book was very satisfying on many levels and I I enjoyed every hour I spent with it, reluctant to leave it."
2,There's a better Terpsichore recording available!,"If you're buying this CD for the motets, go ahead. But the Dances from Terpsichore are MUCH more fun on the New London Consort recording, directed by Philip Pickett (Decca). They actually make you feel like dancing - imagine that! Plus there are fifteen tracks totaling over 45 minutes on that record, as compared to only 9 tracks totaling 22-1/2 minutes on this one (a selection of Praetorius motets makes up the difference). This version of the dances is muddy, pale, and ponderous by comparison - New London Consort ROCKS!!!"
2,Praetorius: Dances from Terpsichore - a disappointment,"We had seen the Toronto Consort performing Praetorius's Christmas Vespers, bought the CD and could not play it often enough. My high hopes were disappointed in the Dances. The music is not as exciting and the recording not as vibrant."
2,Rubbish,"Listening to this CD release is not unlike listening to the original vinyl ..IF YOU STICK COTTON WOOL IN YOUR EARS...I vote this as the worst reissue I have heard...yes folks even worse than the Virgin reissues of Van der graaf ..(and that's saying something..) I have given this 2 stars..but only because the music is so good...don't be conned by David Munrows name appearing in bold letters ..I am sure he would have been devastated by the poor treatment handed out to this music and the wonderful musicians playing it....Shame ..Shame..Shame...find the vinyl instead ..It is a warm,well balanced recording of the wonderful music of Praetorius being played by musicians with a passion."
5,Solid Performer,"Excellent electric stapler. Has never been failed to staple (or operate) and has never been jammed. Uses regular staples. I've never tried testing its limits but it will staple over 10 sheets without any problems. Overall, very solid performer."
5,what a bargain,"What a bargain, bought this stapler at a garage sale for $ 1.00, cannot wait to use it....have owned one before and loved it...so what a bargain"
3,Good but not Great,"The positives: very reliable, sturdy, fairly quiet, and doesn't jam if not pushed to it's limit. The negatives: high price, larger than I thought, will not staple 25 sheets but handles up to 20 just fine, and alittle slow and deliberate when stapling. I've gone through many brands of electric staplers...so I'm just happy to have one that works."
3,Made in China -- Buts operates well so far,"This looks like the heavy and reliable original article. It is designed to look that way. In reality, it is a cheap, plastic made in China imitation. You could spend $15 and get the same performance.Do not be fooled like I was.LATER EVALUATIONI have to change my harsh criticism to qualified endorsement. This machine operates very nicely. It never jams even when you use too many pages. While I would prefer a nice metal case versus plastic, if it continues working this well I will be very pleased."
5,A beautiful memento for your family,"This is a beautiful book with places for you to personalize it. It has lovely drawings and was well thought out. I would recommend it to anyone who is looking to create a keepsake. It really is an easy was to make a ""snapshot"" of your family for a year's time."
5,Great Album,"There is no sophmore jinx on this album. Take 6, the accapella sensation, has done it again. They explore paths not taken on this on. Veering further away from the traditonal quartet sound, they have embraced more jazz and pop idoms: like on the title track ""So Much to Say"". This is a must buy for serious jazz and gospel fans alike."
5,Picks up where the first one left off,"So Much to Say is a bit more pop\secular than the first, but this CD, along with their 1988 debut, must be some of the greatest cappella of all time. My favorite tracks were ""Come unto Me,"" ""Sundays on the Way,"" and ""I Believe."" Take 6 blends so well, their music is layered, and its hard to pick out the individual parts, even if you have musical training. The chord progressions are interesting, so is the rhythmic style and the synchopation. You could never regret buying this CD, no matter what kind of music you like. Really, I don't see how anyone could not like it."
5,This is all Josquin's music! And it is FABULOUS!,"Josquin was one of the great composers of all time. This beautiful disk can get you a nice taste of the music. The voices blend so well and the horizontal layers are all cared for so the vertical structures are revealed, but not dominant. That is the way polyphonic music should work for music in the sacred style. In other places like tracks 4 & 6 there is a nice emphasis on the vertical structures without losing the linear voice leading.One really can't call the vertical structures CHORDS at this time, because such a concept did not exist.Track 13 on the death of Ockeghem is simply exquisite!This disk is a wonderful addition to your Josquin collection and if it is your first disk - Don't STOP here! Get his masses and other works. Josquin is absolutely stunning."
3,Beneath the objective criticism often lies a subjective grandeur,"3 1/2Sacred choral works sung with the subtle grace of stained glass refracting light; still at times synonymous sentiment in tonality looses value in between a few more upbeat numbers. While focusing to the vibration of what was undoubtedly a symbolic pillar of faith many centuries ago, one benefits from a detached awareness from composition in favor of utter immersion into the sublime transitions throughout these hallowed vocals. Although hardly a definitive collection, this disc serves as a good introduction (& painful reminder) to the ancient, purist reception this stilling music once knew."
4,Inspirational,The Runner starring David Horton is a well put together documentary about the journey from Mexico to Canada via Pacific Crest Trail. The movie is quite raw and does a fantastic job of giving the viewer an idea of how doing something of these proportions can mentally and physically affect a human. I recommend this video to any ultrarunner or just a runner looking for some motivation.
4,Suffering is optional,"THis was inspiring. I ran my first Ultra distance last October (2006) and thought I woudl never do it again. Having kept an eye on Dean Karnazes as well as seeing thismovie, I'm re-inspired to do it again in '08. Looking forward to the biography of Dean Karnazes by Journey Film"
2,Very Amateurish,"I bought this along with ""Running on the Sun"" and ""Dancing the Bear"". ""Running on the Sun"" was the only decent movie of the bunch. It was filmed by a professional documentary film maker and you get a fairly good sense of what running the Badwater is all about. ""Bear"" and ""The Runner"" seem pretty amateurish by comparison. Of the three, ""The Runner"" is the worst. The director seems like someone more used to making commercials than movies. He periodically throws out nerve-wracking montages of images (20 images in 20 seconds) accompanied by very annoying hyperactive drums. I also didn't care much for ""the runner"", David Horton. Maybe it was too many Clint Eastwood and Charles Bronson movies as a kid, but overly emotional, touchy-feely men who will cry at the drop of a hat tend to creep me out a bit. No doubt, considering the type of running he does, Horton is one tough dude, but I prefer guys to be a bit more reserved."
1,Somewhat boring and tangential,"The description of this video from websites and the DVD jacket is misleading. Very little scenery from the PCT is shown, with most footage stemming from just a few parts of the trail and experience. This was all about one man and how special he and the crew seem to think he is. The most interesting part of the film was when Flying Brian helped David Horton through the High Sierra. That was the only part that really did justice to this magnificent trail. Interviews with Horton's family were mildly interesting, but much of this--as well as interviews with David at stops--seemed tangential."
1,Boring first one hundred pages,Allen Drury's DECISION seems that it was Written to accomodate a certain number of pages required rather than have an attention holding story line. I came close to giving up on the book. The only thing that saved it was that I skipped one hundred pages at the beginning of the book before it held my attention. I will not read another Allen Drury book.
3,"A very ""Dirty"" Harry","A great story but a barely passible PQ. Lots of dirt on the picture and inconsistant color saturation (from washed out to cartoonish to very good, depending on the scene) I was dissapointed in the video transfer, could have been better."
5,Awesome,"This was a great film all-around. Filled with suspense, action and mystery. Clint Eastwood is amazing in his ""tough cop"" role. No one does it like Clint. From start to finish, this was one of the darkest crime films ever.It's just a simple story - Cop tries to hunt down serial killer, and that's it. But... This has to be Clint Eastwood's second best movie. The plot flows perfectly with the story. If you like cop movies with an interesting plot, this is the one for you."
3,ya feeling lucky punk?,"the story is theres a freaky psycho out there toying with a rather forceful hotshot cop called dirty harry.dirty harry is played by clint eastwood.its not particuraly bad.the kids will have seen worse.the classic scene that defines clint.hes finaly got the bad guy cornered after a big firefight.he walks closer to the bad guy and utters the classic lines""i know what youre thinking punk.did he fire 6 times or only 5?and to tell you truth ive forgotten myself in all the exitement.but being how this is a .44 magnum revolver,the most powerful handgun on earth and will blow your head clean off your shoulders,you gotta ask yourself one question.do ya feel lucky punk?well,do ya punk?"".it was awesome!it is the first of like 8 or 9 movies starring the dirty harry character.the best too.his superior officers come off as pretty annoying.this is clints best!"
3,It's just OK,"Phony-looking blood, an interpretation by Eastwood that lacks sufficient humor (and he even punches the famous ""six shots"" speech in the wrong places), and a really fascist approach to law and order all add up to general mediocrity. So why does it work? Andy Robinson. For a thriller to be effective, you need a good bad guy, and Robinson took Scorpio as far as he could without ever quite going over the top. See it on video, by the way, and skip the TBS broadcasts -- it's not rated R for nothing. (On TV, you lose Eastwood's one genuinely funny line as well as a horrific shot of Robinson during the beating he's paid to have done to himself.)"
5,Jim Emerson's review is misguided at best.,"Jim Emerson's review states that Harry disregards the law in pursuit of justice. Not True! Harry is motivated by justice and respect for the law, and is hampered by political posturing of local officials. ""Magnum Force"" demonstrates that Harry will not bend the law or resort to vigilantism."
2,Dirty Harry,"I play the dvd, DIRTY HARRY & dvd stopped in the middle of playing and the messsge disc error & I removed disc & then played disc again then disc played it was very dark."
4,On The AFI's list of The 100 Greatest Thrillers of All-Time.,"""Dirty Harry"" from 1971 has the distinction on being put on The American Film Institutes' list of The 100 Greatest American Thrillers of All-Time which was announced in June 2001. I first saw Inspector Harry Callahan of the San Francisco Homicide division in the theatre way back in early 1972 soon after it was first released.When tickets were only one dollar.Even less for the matinees! I first got it on tape way back in the early '80's on Beta. Which I regret now because Beta is practically extinct. Later got it on VHS. Now the newest edition is better than ever,being digitally processed,letterboxed,in Dolby Surround,so it looks and sounds terrific.Now I can really appreciate Bruce Surtees' great cinematography. And, composer Lalo Schifrin's inspired bass pounding,pulsating jazz and rock score.All under the late great Don Siegel's masterful direction."
4,Clint Eastwood at His Ruggid Best,"A somewhat dark movie about a San Francisco cop who has a flare for causing trouble and making his superiors feel nervous. Eastwood plays Harry Callahan with the appropriate cynicism and, as a result, the character is both honest and hilarious. The bad guy is great, too, although Eastwood's toughness cannot be upstaged. The sequence that involves Callahan's new partner asking why they call him Dirty Harry provides the most memorable dialogue in the movie. Well worth seeing."
5,Classic Action Movie,"Clint Eastwood plays the role of the ultimate hero-tough guy. While enforcing the law he constantly keeps having runins with the people in charge. The mayor,the chief of police, and assorted others are always giving him problems. Harry goes about his business striking terror into the hearts of the forces of evil. Harry begins the pursuit of a serial killer. Once again he has trouble observing the civil rights of the killer. Harry's big struggle with the killer goes to the final. The villain in this movie is without question scary. The movie has outstanding actors and the action is nonstop. The ending of the movie is also something to be watched. Watch this video to see an all time classic. You will not be dissapointed."
5,And In The Beginning...,"DIRTY HARRY started it all. Every police thriller from 1971 on has been a spinoff of Eastwood's Callahan character. Many have tried, but none have even come close to the hard charm Clint displays in this and the rest of the series. Classic Eastwood."
3,Closer to 3 and a half stars than 3 stars,"I've always liked this album, but I've always wished I liked it more than I do. There are one or two songs on here that I skip over when listening to the CD. (For example, I just can't get into the song Homeboy for some reason.)Why did I give it over 3 stars then? Because the good songs on here are VERY good songs! My favorites are: Take It To Heart, Tear It Up, and You Show Me. All really great songs!Actually, there are no truly bad songs on here. Even Homeboy's halfway decent. Michael is my favorite singer, so maybe I'm just too picky and expect too much all the time. I want every song to knock me off my feet, and not every song on here does.Still, as I said, there are some really great songs on this one. Plus, it's hard to go wrong with Michael's voice. If you're a fan, you're most likely going to like this album."
4,Good but not one of the best,"It's not one of my favourite album of Michael McDonald, but there are some good songs. My favourites are Get The Word Started (written with David Pack), Love Can Break Your Heart (with Kirk Whalum on Saxophone), Take It To Heart (written with Diane Warren)."
2,WHY?,"I ONLY BOUGHT THE ALBUM RECENTLY, NINE YEARS AFTER IT'S RELEASE AND I THOUGHT IT SOUNDED REALLY DISAPPOINTING. FRANKLY, I'M A FAN OF MICHAEL MCDONALD AND I KNOW HE'S CAPABLE OF WRITING GOOD MATERIALS. BUT WHAT HE'S DOING WITH DANCE DJ SHEP PETTIBONE ON THE OPENING TRACK IS BEYOND ME. EVEN THE TITLE TRACK WITH DIANE WARREN BOMBED BIG TIME. I REALLY ENJOYED THE GOOD OLD DAYS OF ""I'D BE YOUR ANGEL"", ""THAT'S WHY"", ""I CAN LET GO NOW"", ""SWEET SURRENDER"". WHATEVER HAPPENED, MIKE?"
4,Color is way off,"I was very excited upon ordering these dishes. I had been looking for blue dinnerware for a while. I ordered the Cobalt Blue based on the color shown in the photo. That color doesn't even come close! The Cobalt Blue is closer to Navy, which isn't what I wanted. Now I will have to go to the hassle of returning 4 big boxes. Other than that, the dinnerware looks nice."
3,tiny cups,"I wanted to add to my fiestaware economically. Unfortunately the cups are small, only 7 oz. Fiesta also makes a 16 oz. jumbo cup (not a mug) which I prefer, and I suspect would be preferable to many customers."
2,"Love the plates, Hate the scratches!","I have wanted a set of these dishes for years. Finally purchased a service for 10 last March 2011. Not long after, I started seeing marks on the plates and bowls. I am disappointed. I have tried all the advice I have found on the web, and still they are there. I love the size of the plates and bowls, and how they feel. The marks look like little hairs. (gross I have the white, and would not purchase again. Now I am searching for another new set. Will probably go with the Mikasa, as I have had a set of them for 25 years, and they look brand new. Just wanted a new pattern. Oh well, live and learn."
5,Peacock is a GORGEOUS Color,"I should start off by saying that I'm new to Fiesta Dinnerware. Peacock is GORGEOUS - my friend got me started with a round ball salt and pepper shaker set, and I got two of these 20 piece sets to start my collection off.I would recommend these to anyone. Can be used every day and dressed up by throwing a flower arrangement in the middle of the table with a few candles. I'd be proud to serve anyone on these dishes.I should also say that this set comes with GREAT cups. Some sets come with cups with a little ""ring"" handle, which are pretty dippy looking if you ask me. These are the good cups! Like fat little teacups."
5,"great service, great dishes","I placed 2 different orders for a total of 55 place settings of fiestaware, spread across 10 different colors. The dishes look great. Everything arrived quickly without any hassles & nothing was broken. People who expect to match color off pictures from the web aren't doing their homework. Check colors at local stores & you'll know exactly what you'll be getting. There are also a lot of websites with more pictures and detailed color descriptions."
5,Took me back to my childhood,"Growing up in the late '50's and early '60's, my parents had a set of dark green china (not Fiestaware, unfortunately). This 20-piece set is the first set of china I ever bought myself, and of course I got Fiestaware in evergreen. The finish is a deep, rich dark green, and eight months in, I couldn't be happier with its appearance and durability. It goes from the fridge to the microwave to the sink to be washed without scratching or chipping. Sturdy.I was so happy with the set, I also bought the sugar and creamer with an extra sugarbowl for Nutrasweet -- in evergreen, naturally. I'll keep adding to this set with more pieces as I get the money."
1,Fiestaware Persimmon 855 20-Piece Dinnerware Set,"Really poor color matching. The cups weren't even the same color category as the plates. Some pieces never arrived many weeks after the order. Trying to return it introduced us to the nonexistent customer support department at Amazon. Their emails don't accept replies (I wonder why) and just try to find the form for submitting a message - it's buried so deep in their site I'm suprised it wasn't crushed by the weight of all the pages above it. And then, when you do submit a message, no one reads it...you just can a nonsensical canned reply. In the future I wouldn't buy anything from Amazon I couldn't afford to lose."
5,Best Dishes EVER!,"Best dishes ever! I love everything about them. The fact they are lead free, made in the USA, durable, and all in all a great price for the product you receive.I will definitely be buying more!"
1,redundant,There is absolutely nothing new in this book that hasn't been around for centuries. The Spiritual Frontiers lending library thirty years ago had books with better insight on the subjects covered in this book. Thought a psychiatirst might bring something else into the studies. NOT!!!!!
1,Good for children,"I am disappointed to see that the work has been castrated and expurgated to suit western anxieties. In particular the Yamato Takeru story has been watered down, and its powerful graphic and erotic subtleties have been papered over. Inexcusable in a work alleging to convey the full flavor of Japanese mythology."
3,a good product but not for USA,I got this product weeks ago and it is the same as the ones I used before. But the only thing is that it is surpposed to sell to other countries with some foreign language on its body. I don't know whether this is fine in USA.
1,FRUSTRATING,"I consider myself to be at least a half way decent home cook, though I still occasionally burn water, usually after I've had one to many glasses of vino rojo. I love his sausages and buy them frequently from Ferry Plaza Farmers Mkt in SF, though NEVER from Whole Paycheck; there are some excellent recipes; but the Layout and Index are a nightmare. It's kinda like finding yourself trapped in a Kafkaesque abattoir. I hope they publish a revised edition that makes sense. I usually end up throwing the book into the corner and pulling out Joy of Cooking, Julia Child, Silver Palate, or adapting a Moosewood veggie recipe."
2,"This ""tome"" of meat cookery not realistic for everyday cooks","Considering how hefty this volume is, I was hoping to find recipes to produce well-cooked, flavorful meats with nearly any cut of meat I had in my freezer, using everyday ingredients I would normally have on hand. Not necessarily so. This is more of a gourmet's cookbook for those with time to cook, access to big-city delis and a liking for fussy sauces. Example: Puebla-Style Tongue in Chipotle Chile Sauce; Cured Pork Loin Roasted with Parsnips in Maple-Vanilla Sauce; Caribbean Pork Braised with Limes and Oranges; Sauteed Filet Mignon with Corn and Chile Cheese Sauce. There is some basic information on how to best cook some cuts of meat, but not enough to justify the price of the book, and the recipes rely heavily on the fancy ingredients. As a side note, if you don't like to include alcohol in your cooking, this is not the book for you! The recipes and tips on cooking pork ribs were good."
2,All in all- a disappointment,This book contains some good general information on meat such as the different cuts and how to select meat at the butchers etc. But there dearth of information as well. There are many many recipes for marinades and sauces and dry rubs- most of which I would classify as absurd novo must-have-been-thought-up-while-drunk cuisine. No mention is made of basics like chimichurri. Basic recipes for cooking meat are also left out in favor of some stuff that must have been included because of a dare. I have tried about six of the reciepes of which three were passable.
2,"Nice to look at, but avoid the recipes","The book is nice to look at, and might even be pretty enough for the coffee table (if you loved meat that much). However, the recipes are something else again. I've tried several and all were somewhat disappointing, and none would make my ""make again"" list."
2,Did they test the recipes?,Not-Like-Mom's Meat Loaf was very good although a little too moist. Oakland-Style Barbecue Sauce was a loser - a waste of good ingredients as well as time. Am now skeptical of the rest of the book.
5,Great book,"This is the most complete book on meat I've seen. Everything you want to know about the cuts and what cooking method they're best suited for.Every recipie is very good, right down to different wet and dry ""rubs"".I have learned so much from this book, and now enjoy meat I never thought I liked.You can't go wrong with this one!"
4,Comprehensive but not complete,"Interesting and informative with an excellent and comprehensive collection of recipes, HOWEVER... only one page devoted to bacon?! And no mention of pork belly?! Slightly disappointed, but still a good book."
4,This is THE Meat Bible!,"For anyone who eats meat, or just eats meat on...ahem...rare occasions, you simply must get this book. I found myself sitting down and reading it cover to cover like a novel. Fascinating information on meat production and why we need to approach today's cuts differently than our parents did. The recipes are fantastic and it is very well illustrated. You don't need any other book to discover how to best cook meat. My only complaint with it, and a very minor one, is that sometimes the way the recipes are laid out don't flow easily, what with different ""flavor steps"" and so on; I prefer a read-straight-through recipe. I recently tried out their Coca-cola barbecue sauce and was blown away by it. The way they do Mexican-style flanks steaks and cheaper cuts of meat are wonderful. Get it. You'll be glad you did."
3,Okay,i personally didn't really like this enclosure. the hard drive barely fits and the fan is really small. It is not really quality made and the fire wire is alot slower then the usb. i would not really recommend this
3,I'm not sure yet,"I bought two of this product for my children. One works fine and the other just stopped working. When I got ready to send if back, it was working fine. I still sent it back -- hoping I get a better one next time. Amazon return system if fantastic though! I notified them yesterday of the problem and my replacement is already on the way! That's wonderful!"
2,"very fragile, won't last long","My husband and I bought these, the white one and the blue one earluier this fall and neither one lasted more than a month, mine actually is still functional, but they go through a whole battery in 6-8 hours, and some songs won't copy correctly onto the player, a lot of corrupted songs that I was able to listen to on my IPOD (which I ended up buying after I gave up on this).The controls are also a lot more confusing that the instructions lead on, be wary of this if you choose to buy it."
3,Cute - but.......,"For the price, this unit is a pretty good deal. It sounds great and seems to work OK. The only ""problem"" is in the function selection. If you just want it to play back the music you stored, fine, but if you want to change the playback curve or have it repeat or do a random selection, it isn't the easiest thing in the world to finagle the button(s) to get where you want. Just takes some patience and practice."
2,so-so,"Works fine, but SO confusing to operate. I bought the Macvision at a GREAT price, so if you're looking for a bargain and patient enought to learn the system, this may work for you. For some reason some songs download from the computer and others won't. The menus are so complicated, and the users manual is not much help. I bought it for my 9-year-old's birthday, and fortunately, she's thrilled. She doesn't mind that I've only been able to get 12 songs on it, or that she can't figure out the menus either. It plays FM radio, it's pretty, it seems reasonably durable. And I've put my 12-year-old to work to set it up. She figured out my Sandisk player in a heartbeat and filled it with music for me--BTW, I LOVE my Sandisk and highly recommend it."
5,good little mp3 player,I bought this for my 11 yr old daughter. It was easy to load with songs using our PC and she loves it!!
2,Hard to figure out,"As a non-nerdy computer user, the whole thing is beyond me with the short amount of attention I have been able to give to the device and software. Problems with my WMP or Dell jukebox either one recognizing the device as compatible--so I am at a loss given my knowledge or lack thereof. No help available so I now own a fancy blue necklace that will make me look cool."
4,GOOD DUB,"This is a splendid Reggea Dub Cd, Dub means no singing by the artists. This "" no singing "" is not the actual reason for calling these cd's Dub. Dub just means that it is an alternate version of an original song. In the old times though it made the most sense to take the foreground singing or lead singer out so you could enjoy the music by itself. This CD has some of the best Bass lines i've heard in my life. Mixed with all kinds of other sounds it makes this cd a must have."
5,Remember Amnesia,"For those who thrive on the dreamy landscape of the surreal, ""Amnesia"", by Douglas Anthony Cooper, a Toronto ex-pat now in Oaxaca, is an absolute must. Cooper's nameless narrator ensnares the reader in an erotic psychological terroir. Cooper is a multi-talented author with a wide range. After you finish ""Amnesia"",treat yourself to ""Milrose Munce and the Plague of the Toxic Fungus"" and ""Milrose Munce and the Den of Professional Help"", Cooper's Young Adult series, and pour yourself a big shot of mezcal and settle in."
1,will not print in black-and-white if a color is low,"Here it goes - my first negative review for a consumer product. First ever.This printer is a complete waste of money. I NEVER print in color, and yet the various color always seem to exhaust themselves as if by magic. So, now, with a one page printing job on my hand, I can't use my printer because it ran out of the light blue. This printer will NOT let you print in b/w if your color levels are down, but, again, I NEVER USE the colors. They are simply drained slowly with every black and white printing job I send to the machine.Besides, it's extraordinarily slow - it takes forever to come online, it asks a whole bunch of unnecessary questions before proceeding with the printing job, and, get this, it SHAKES on my desk in a way I've never seen an appliance do.Seriously, this is an incredibly ridiculous printer. No one should buy it."
2,Not worth the hassle!,"We bought this printer for our business so we would have the ability to print off labels and also do photo quality brochures,catalogs, flyers, etc. So far, I think I've spent more time unjamming paper from the back of the printer than I have actually using it! It just isn't capable of grabbing label sheets without creating a paper jam on at least every third print out. I can't even say how many sheets of label paper this machine has ruined for me already. I also discovered that it won't do two sided printing without an error message for the second side of the sheet. I ruined over fifty sheets of paper and a whole lot of ink figuring out this problem and ended up hand feeding each page just to complete one catalog. The print quality is okay when it does work but I think it won't be long before I'll have to find a better quality machine for the business. I feel I've wasted too much time and too much money with this printer already."
1,Ink System Failed,"I bought this printer and have hardly used it over the past 18 months. The black ink cartridge was empty so until I bought ink I used my other printer. Everything I had used it for did look great. When I did get the ink and replace the cartridge it put up the error message that the ink system has failed. No trouble shooting will fix it so I gave up. A like new printer in the garbage. Maybe I just got a bad one but for now on, Im back to Epson."
1,Absolutely hate it,"When it works, it gives gorgeous prints. However, it's very difficult to use and wastes lots of paper and expensive ink. I've just spent the better part of an hour, and several test prints, trying to get it to use the 4x6 paper feeder, but it keeps printing on 8 1/2 x 11 or printing one line on the 4x6 paper or delivering a beautifully rendered abstract version of the picture or, well, it's doing everything but what I WANT it to do. I've tried to find info in the online manual to no avail. I'm ready to take a sledgehammer to it. Look around before buying this printer...they can't all be this frustrating, can they? Can they? I'm going to take my photos to Costco to print; this isn't worth it!"
1,DO YOUR RESEARCH before wasting money on this printer.,"This printer is the biggest piece of poop I've ever owned. More than half the time it does not detect paper in the tray (I have to force feed each photo sheet manually), it will randomly print garbage and waste paper when starting the computer with the printer connected, the trays don't hold much paper at ALL, the ink is very expensive, the drivers are weak (they killed services.exe the first time I tried to install them causing my computer to reboot). It's just terrible. When it works it prints beautifully which is a real shame. I'm paying the price for not doing my own research prior to purchase. Do what you want but I highly recommend exploring ALL other options before deciding on this mind-numbingly lousy piece of junk."
2,Ugg--An Expensive Clunker,"I was not so happy with it anyway, and when I went to buy ink I thought, ""Am I crazy."" I returned it and got a black and white multi-function laser printer. It's cheep to run (after the initial investment), fast, better quality, and the text can be highlighted without smearing.This is true love!"
2,Design flaw,"The printer has a major flaw that has not been corrected by three replacements. When the printer runs out of paper there is the usual prompting. When the paper is replenished and ""OK"" is touched, the first photo is destroyed. The first sheet has virtually nothing printed on it. On the second sheet, the first 25% of the image is missing. The next 10% is highly distorted and the remaining 65% is OK. This has happened with photo paper from both trays, but mostly from the 4x6 tray as that is what I use mostly."
5,It does what it says!,I've had this printer for over 3 years. It still works like in the first day. Great 4x6 photos! Fast enough black printing. Nothing to complain about!
2,Cannot Print Pre-printed Forms,"This is a good photo printer, but it has one major problem: it comes with ""auto sensing"", and so if you want to print a pre-printed form that has text on both sides, the printer will eject the form and tell you it is upside down. Even with the assurances from the brochures and manuals that you can bypass this auto-sensing, you cannot. Setting the paper source to ""transparency"" does no good. If you have preprinted checks or invoices or any other paper with printing on both sides, this printer will flat out refuse to print on the form. For some this will be no big deal. For small business owners, it is probably a major issue. Watch out for ""auto sensing""."
2,Works Poorly with a Mac,"Note that I am using this with an Apple MacBook Pro.The most frustrating thing about this printer has been trying to get it to print on the right paper. Even after going through all the print settings to set the paper feed tray to the photo tray which holds the 4 X 6 paper, it will feed paper from the 8.5 X 11 tray on the first print. I always have to print over, or trim the large paper. I'm not sure where the bug is, in Apple's software or HP's.When I finally get the paper right, the color and sharpness of the print is great. It's far more expensive in paper than I had any idea it would be, however."
4,Great buy,"I bought this printer because Amazon had it for even cheaper than a lower model when compared with other places to buy it. Except for a little difficutly installing the drivers (more to do withy my computer though), this printer has been great. It is my first PhotoSmart printer, so I don't have much to compare it to except for an old deskjet, but the photo prints are really good when used with the best HP paper. Also, I love to switch the printer in black/white draft mode....it prints faster than my laser printers at work.I'm taking one start off my rating because of the difficulty installing the drivers. Other than that, quite a bargain."
4,Tammy with superstar guest stars !,"Tammy's last release for ""epic"" has her teaming with some of the biggest names in the biz ! Etlton John, Sting, Smokey Robinson & Aaron Neville ! Two solo songs are pure Tammy gold, ""If It's The Last Thing I Do"" and ""What Do They Know"". The duets that standout are ""Glass Houses"" with Joe Diffie and the fun tune ""Girl Thang"" with Wynonna. This entire disc is terrific and if you like Tammy, this is one of her very best !"
5,Nice!,Wonderful album. Have heard her stuff on NPR for years and finally sprung for a CD. We will be buying more of her albums in the future.
4,Very good - but could have been better,"Some of the pieces are simply unbelievable, but at other times it sounds like Yngwie is improvising. He always comes back for the main themes, though, and the themes are quite beautiful. The orchestration is better than any I've heard for this sort of stuff; (e.g. Dead Winter Dead by Savatage). If you like neoclassical fusion guitar, you'll love this - guaranteed."
5,Stunning!,"I am not a fan of most classical music so I was a little reluctant to order this CD. However, from the first listen, I was totally awestruck. Malmsteen's performance on this CD is nothing short of amazing. If you are inclined to buy just one classical performance and you love guitar, look no further. It just doesn't get any better than this. Encore please!!"
5,Yngwie's Best,"It's about time! This is the recording that Yngwie should have released years ago: Symphony and Yngwie. While many of Yngwie's releases have suffered from sub-par lyrics and vocals, this recording has no such draw-backs. I highly recommend it.For neo-classical metal with vocals and compositions that are excellent, I highly recommend the band ""Symphony X"". It's the band that Yngwie should have formed after Alcatrazz. The best recordings are ""Divine Wings of Tragedy"" and ""V"". Also excellent are ""Twilight In Olympus"" and ""The Damnation Game"". If you like Yngwie's rock albums, you'll love Symphony X."
5,"Malmsteen,the maestro...","This is Malmsteen's best album in my opinion because he's finally done what he should have been doing all along, playing with an orchestra. I also think his strength is defintely as an instrumentalist. Malmsteen's rock albums are really good yet one will hear similarities in his songwriting and playing style. But at least he has good style and that has always put him in the top 10% of great guitarists. He's never had any bad muscians or singers in his bands but sometimes his lyrics arent up to par. I usually get the biggest musical thrills out of his instrumentals(Krakatau,Eclipse,Black Star,Evil Eye,Icarus Dream Suite,Golden Dawn,Brothers,etc). Many critics diss Malmsteen as a souless player without imagination who overplays, but that's just jealousy and inability talking more than anything else...The man can creatively play circles around most guitarists and he's got a ton of guts that goes into his playing too."
5,My new favorite Malsteen recording,"At first I thought this was to be much like Uli Roth's Puccini stuff. After listening to it a few times I found that Yngwie's Concerto is quite well rounded and appealing in it's own right. I nice blend of shameless indulgence and well crafted music.I guess one of my favorite parts of this project is that there are no rock singers involved and also no lyrics, traditionally two things that have kept me from buying Yngwie recordings."
5,YANGWEE IS GOD,"YNGWIE'S FINGERS FLY LIKE AIRPLANES OF MUSIC. HE IS THE BEST EVER EXCEPT FOR ESTEBAN AND RAFFI. I HEARD ONCE HE AND STEVEN SEGAL HAD A SHREDDING CONTEST AND YNGWIE BLEW HIM OUT THE WINDOW WITH ONE PITCH HARMONIC JUST LIKE IN THAT TWISTED SISTER VIDEO. HE IS REALLY THAT GOOD.(Oh, and he dresses pretty cool too.)"
3,Very ambitious but does not reach it's goal.,"As other reviewers have pointed out, Yngwie's tone is too saturated and noisy and clashes with the orchestra when playing electric. If he had played with a more ""rolled off"" tone like Eric Johnson, I think it would have sounded better. It may be composed but it sounds like he is recycling his licks over varying arrangements. The acoustic pieces are much better and make for enjoyable listening. Also, the orchestra is not really allowed to ""breathe"" or have any other breaks within the music as Yngwie is constantly noodling over top of everything. There aren't many slow passages either which doesn't add variety to the listening experience. I would like to hear the live version to see if there is a noticable difference."
3,love him or hate him,"People love to talk about yngwie. Don't run out and buy this because you're tired of him and want something new from him. It's the same fast playing, it just has an orchestra behind it."
2,Yngwie unleases the fury - not!,"On this CD, Yngwie demonstrates incredible guitar playing facility but also reveals anemic compositional skill. In short, the music was unsatisfying. Yngwie often says he can play violin solos such as Pagganini's 5th Caprice. It would be interesting to hear him sit in place of a solo violinist of a classical orchestra and play electric guitar to great classical pieces from composers such as J.S. Bach, Vivaldi, Mozart, etc."
2,FLAWLESS PLAYING BUT POOR LIFELESS RECORDING,"FLAWLESS PLAYING BUT POOR LIFELESS RECORDING. The guitar, orchestra is done nicely. Some weird elements in some spots. Overall enjoyable. But not easy on the ears. The orchestra drowns the guitar. The EQs are all weird. There is not very good definition on the sound. Could have been way better. Maybe a remaster version will be different sounding. Listening on various equipment and speakers, I still feel the recording and especially mixing could have been done much better. Orchestra at times appears too distant, very low definition to orchestra or guitar sounds. Playing louder on a hifi sound a bit better but still the orchestra drowns the guitar many times. It may be normal for this kind of a ""record"" if it was a one shot, live recording. imho. Omar"
2,"Swing and a miss , batter","Despite all of the talented people involved in this project , it is not a product that is greater than the sum of it's parts . Yngwie spends most the time out of sync with the orchestra . The fact that his work was recorded on a different continent shows . This is not Yo Yo Ma here . It isn't even Rick Wakeman ( am I showing my age ? ). If you like modern musicians working WITH an orchestra try Nightwish, The Moody Blues or Renaissance . I actually like Yngwie's work and have been buying his material since his 1st. Rising Force album . He is one of the most talented guitar players in the world . His Baroque style stands in stark contrast to the Blues or Jazz based chord structures that most other guitar greats use . It is just disappointing that when Yngwie gets his chance to take his material and talent to this level , it fails to impress ."
5,SPEECHLESS,"I was completely speechless when I first heard Yngwie Malmsteen. He is arguebly one of the best guitarists in the world. I mean what he can do with a guitar is the likes of which has never been heard before. Combining neo classical elements with old fashion thrash metal. Not just metal. Blues, pop, classical, latin, this guy can play them all. This is definitly one of the albums I'm going to remeber most. Wow, there is no one that can compare to Yngwie and theres some pretty amazing guitar players in metal."
3,"Interesting, but not essential","The guitar playing is often amazingly fast, but I can'thelp but feel this is a vehicle for Yngwie to improvise. Someof the moments it clicks, but most I hunger for better compositions. Yngwie deserves a lot of credit for the work, but I just think he needs to work on the compositions some more.I think this is one of Yngwie's best work, but as a ""classical piece"", it is just not essential listening."
5,Yum!,"This is really good. I love organic candies and organic goods. This is better for you than the ones from the non healthy grocery stores. You can read and pronounce all the ingredients. Ingredients are just plain and simple. No imitation sweetners, no high fructose corn syrup and no hydrogenated fats.What more do you want? Getting back to basics is what I say."
2,Very basic information,"I found the information to be of limited value. If you are interested in figuring out how to decide if you have anything to write about, then the exercises may be of help. Ms Hauer provides brief guidelines on formatting dialogue, punctation and a chapter of the process of publishing your memoir. My money was better spent on Stephen King's ""On Writing"" and Tristine Rainer's ""Your Life as Story""."
2,Lacking character,"I was told this was an amazing book, but was disappointed. I thought the book lacked character and I found it hard to finish."
5,SABBATH AT THE TOP!!!,"After 3 colossal masterpieces, SABBATH hit the world with a more mature and creative album VOL 4!!! TONY IOMMI is truly a great musician...The guitars on vol 4 are fantastic...GEEZER lyrics are brilliant and OZZY got the right voice to be the frontman of a heavy metal band!Some songs are pure rock art like WHEELS OF CONFUSION, SUPERNAUT and UNDER THE SUN!!!"
3,"Too much hype, the weakest of their first 6 albums","I knew that Vol. 4 would receive rave reviews from pretty much everyone, so I had to put my two cents in here. All my friends think this is the definitive Sab disc but I have know idea why. Yeah ""Wheels Of Confusion/The Straightener"" kicks things off nicely, but from there the results are scattershot. ""Changes"" is not one of my favorites, not necessarily being a bad song but it just has no business doing. ""FX"" is filler at its most obvious, many people mistaking this as feedback genius and ""St. Vitus' Dance"" is a limp noodle. I do like ""Under the Sun..."" so at least the album is bookended well. Overall, I don't think this album has a thing on Master of Reality or Sabbath Bloody Sabbath, call it about on par with Technical Ecstasy. Classic cover art."
4,What You Get Is What You See,"Picture, 1972. What a year in history, particularly American history. Look it up, you'll see. :)At any rate, while there are many *marginal* tracks on this offering, there is one, to wit, ""Snowblind,"" that is the *epitome* of what Black Sabbath truly exemplified, as was caught in a few other songs in their history, such as ""Children of the Grave,"" ""Megalomania,"" ""A National Acrobat,"" ""Dirty Women,"" ""Children of the Sea,"" ""Born Again,"" and others..."
3,drop-off from 'Master of Reality',"In my humble opinion, Sabbath reached their peak around the time of 'Paranoid', which I think is their best, most completely solid effort of the first six 'classic' Sabbath albums. 'Master of Reality' which came right after, was the heaviest, but there is kind of a drop-off from 'Paranoid' to 'Master of Reality', and then again to 'Vol. 4'.Don't get me wrong-- 'Snowblind' is pure genius, one of the best Sabbath songs anywhere ever. 'Supernaut' is one of the greats as well. Even 'Changes' has its own special appeal. I even like 'Under the Sun', although it has to be the clunkiest-sounding little song that I have EVER heard. What's up with that Herman Munster-sounding guitar? I almost start cracking up every time I hear it...The rest of the cuts aren't memorable, however. 'Tomorrow's Dream' is a favorite of many, and 'Cornucopia' has its moments, but this is a much more uneven effort than the first three Sabbath records."
5,the best sabbath album of the ozzy years,"this is proberly sabbath's most diverse album.everysong on this album is a definite winner excluding the short instrumental track f.x.from the beautiful ballat changes{the best ballat ever performed},the great instrumental laguna sunrise,the classic snowblind,my personal favorite and highly underrated under the sun,the very intersting sounding cornucopia and another sabbath classic tomorrow's dream.my favorite tracks are under the sun and wheels of confusion{bill ward's drumming on this track is out of this world}i can not put into words how great this album really is.if you don't have this cd in your own personal collection ,then you are really missing out on some great music.take my word on it ,get this album no matter how much it costs.you won't be dissapointed"
5,This is nirvana,"Could Ozzy sing? Like a banshee. Could Bill play drums like a one-man percussion section? Absolutely. Are Tony and Geezer not the baddest axe-men on the face of the Earth? No doubt. So why isn't Vol.4 the biggest selling album of all time? It's because in the mindset of mass-media, serious lyrics only belong to the Bob Dylans and Johnny Cashes of the music world. Four rockers from the north of England aren't supposed to sing about the realities of the world. And to do so is to overstep their bounds. These guys started out making music to scare people and ended up making this MASTERPIECE of hard rock. The acoustic moments are there to show us that you don't have to be limited by any label defining who you are and what you can do."
4,WAY AHEAD OF IT`S TIME,"VOL 4 HAS A SOUND THAT IS TOTALLY DIFFERENT FROM ANYTHING THEY EVER DID.AS IN ALL OZZY BLACK SABBATH CD`S,EVERY CD WAS DIFFERENT.THATS ONE OF THE THINGS I REALLY LIKED ABOUT THEM.THIS CD HAS THE GREAT SONGS WHEELS OF CONFUSION AND SNOWBLIND ON IT.THE WHOLE CD IS GOOD EXCEPT THE THROW AWAY INSTRUMENTAL FX.EVEN THE SONG CHANGES GROWS ON YOU WITH TIME.THIS IS CLASSIC SABBATH FROM THE EARLY 70`S WHEN NO BAND OUT THERE COULD PLAY ROCK THIS HEAVY.TONY IOMMI`S GUITAR WORK IS GREAT IN THIS AS ARE OZZY`S VOCALS.THIS IS A MUST HAVE FOR ANY SAB FAN OR FAN OR 70`S HARD ROCK.THIS IS REAL SABBATH."
4,"Okay, but Sabbath has done better!!","This album was okay, but some of the tracks were weak and some were just stupid. This was the very first Sabbath album I ever bought and it kind of made me wonder of they were as good as I had heard. (This changed when I heard Paranoid and Master of Reality) This album is probably the weakest of the first 6 albums. But I must say that I did like ""Supernaut"" and ""Snowblind"" alot. ""Changes"" was okay. Those are classics. But stuff like ""Laguna Sunrise"" and ""Under the Sun"" just weren't Sabbath. Buy it if your a Sabbath fan like me, but otherwise you might not care for it."
4,A Slab o' Sabbath . . .,"Given the excellence of their first three albums, Vol. 4 was generally considered a small step backward for Black Sabbath, but it delivers nonetheless. With the exception of Changes, which can be called nothing if not trite, and FX (a short work of noise, strictly for stoners), the album is classic Sabbath. The rest of it more than makes up for these two indulgences. Indeed, heavy and hard driving tracks are the rule with everyone in fine form and obviously fired up (drug reference not necessarily intended). Laguna Sunrise offers a break from the assault, but fits uneasily between the walls of metal before and after. That said, it is also Tony Iommi's finest instrumental moment. Despite its contrast with the rest of the album, it's still a very beautiful piece and the album would be something less without it. All in all, an excellent Sabbath album and another defining monument to metal."
4,It does not compare to the others in my view.,"It was a fair disc but it lacks the hardness of the other albums. It is still a classic album with songs like ""Snowblind"" & ""Supernaut"" the rest are a bit lacky but I can not compline to much because all of the Sabbath discs with or without Ozzy are some of the greatest albums of All time!"
3,A little disapointing,"This is average Sabbath. The only song here that is awesome is Supernaut. This one deserving a place in the ranking of best Sabbath songs. I can't even remember of any other good track. So, if you can, go grab Master Of Reality, Paranoid or Sabotage!"
5,The mighty Sab Four,Every Ozzy-era Sabbath album sounds different and it's interesting to hear the unique power that Sabbath create for this album. Vol 4 is in and of itself brilliant. It stands alone as maybe the first `collection' of songs for the Sab Four. The three prior albums had an unspoken theme or feel to the tunes and Vol 4 strays from that comfort zone. Not that this is a bad thing - indeed Vol 4 is simply devastating.Lose yourself in the mood changes that unfolds with this colossal album. I must admit that `Changes' is weak - not at all a Sab song I enjoy but nevertheless this album is essential.Basically - Sabbath moved forward in their metal progression. Once again they show that they alone are capable of creating something so meaningful.
4,Changes in FX,"I have a version of this CD titled ""Children of the Grave"" with that song done live as a bonus track, released on a no-name label (visit expage.com/powersound2001 for more info), with a different cover."
3,"Not bad, but could be better","Bluntly speaking, Black Sabbath has always been one of my favorite metal bands: ""Paranoid,"" ""Master of Reality"" ""Sabotage"" are all classics. This album, unfortunately, is a half-arsed effort from guys with A.) Entirely too much booze and cocaine; B.) Entirely too great an opinion of themselves (The same thing killed Jim Morrison, spoiled Led Zeppelin and broke up the Beatles; C.) Scraping mud from the Well of Inspiration and calling it Perrier. After this album was ""Never Say Die"" which has exactly ONE passible song (""Johnny Blade,"" which needs to be re-done [Have faith; my band is working on it.] and the Ne Plus Suckarootie Puke-fest ""Technical Ecstacy,"" one of those albums with a great name that absolutely BLOWS!Honestly, if you want a GREAT Sabbath album, I recommend ""Black Sabbath"" (first album) through ""Sabotage."" All of those are truly great.Blessed Bees (Whudda BUZZ!!!)"
5,Volume IV,"Being overlooked by the fans most of the time (because of its name maybe?!), Volume IV definitely stands among the strongest albums of Black Sabbath. I also perceive it as the last album of their ""childhood"" period. The next work they would do ""Sabbath bloody sabbath"" is definitely Sabbath on the next level. Partly due to that fact, the album is quite cherished... Once again, Ozzy delves into the gloomy side, speaks about sorrow, loss and darkness. While lacking the overall completeness (Which would most definitely be present on their subsequent works), I give this album 5 stars, because the songs are as always incredible."
3,Doesnt have that Same energy of the first 3,"I really like this album, but I just ""like it"" its really not anything super special like Sabbaths first 3 albums. But its a good listen, but if you are not really a die hard Sabbath fan and you just want to check them out, you should probably just pick up their first 3 albums are a Greatest Hits package. Greatest Hits 1970-78 started me out. If you are a die hard fan pick this up!"
5,Early Sabbath's best?,"Black Sabbath Vol. 4 doesn't have as many ""Greatest Hits"", like, say, Paranoid- but nonetheless it is heavy and very groovy, and just plain great from start to finish. Give it a listen."
2,Too different from the book,"The acting is stilted, the quality poor, and the script strays too far from the actual book. Since I bought a used VHS, I didn't lose out on all that much, but it most definitely isn't worth the full price for a new video. I showed it to my class of seniors and they found one discrepancy after another. It's a shame they don't remake the movie. It could be a powerful voice, but was quite muted in this version."
1,"CANT AFFORD TO SEE IT, CANT REVIEW IT !!!","This movie needs to be re-released on DVD immediately so the majority can see it. I believe it to be an important film that needs mass viewing. We can get all the HIP HOP , Gansta and , foul mouthed trash thats out there but not a movie that tries to make us understand the human spirit. What a shame !!!!!"
4,Please Re-release this film,"Although dated, this film is griping and disturbing and should be seen. It needs to be re-released so that it can be seen. Not all people can aford the collector's price of those very few scarce copies that become available."
5,Black Like Me,This movie is too good to not let the average person see it because it is cost-prohibited.It has to be reduced.It is an excellent movieWho's making a killing?
3,"""Black like Me"" surrealistic and disturbing",I developed a very wierd feeling while I was watching this video. James Whitmore gives a tour de force performance in a movie that is very raw and atmospheric; a film that undoubtedly caused a stir when it was produced. This film is a must see.
5,Must be released on DVD!,"Please, Please release this VHS movie on DVD! It is a powerful and important movie. Why has it not been released on DVD?"
1,Good music bad sound,The music is fantastic if only had some fidelity to it. It sounds like the microphones were located a another room.
3,This shark doesn't have enough bite,"I've been disappointed in the Shark Euro-Pro. It doesn't seem to get hot enough to handle the all-cotton heavy work shirts my husband wears. The steam feature does work well in terms of not dripping and I like the turn-off feature, but I have to go over and go over any fabric that doesn't smooth out easily. Sometimes the faceplate sticks to certain kinds of cloth, and the handle is not centrally balanced over the faceplate, so that you're only putting pressure on the middle and back end of the faceplate, not the front, pointy end which you need for tight areas. It takes me longer to finish my ironing with this iron, and shoot, I already spend wayyy too much time ironing as it is. It also does not have a temperature guide, so if you're ironing something more sensitive to heat, it's a guessing game where to set the dial."
