4,Better thatn I and II,"Almost there! This film, while not quite leveling up to IV,V,and VI is pretty darn good. Aside from the unrealistic dialogue, which is downright cheesy when it comes to Anakin and Padme, this film has come a long way from the horrid Episodes I and II."
2,Stinks,"As always, the special effects in this film are great. I found the arc of the story to be lame. It is two and a half hours of fluff, then the climax with Ani turning into robot Darth is uneventful. They put the mask on and there is a little steam that comes out. George Lucas is just using the Star Wars name to make cash money now."
2,Lackluster,The finale to this overblown and wooden trilogy turns out to be a let down. The story has no real punch and it feels forced and rote. The special effects are spectacular but the rest is just dreck.
3,a mixed bag,"This movie is definately a mixed bag. On the bright side the special effects are very good, and it has an epic fantasy/sci-fi feel to it, which is something I don't think I could ever get enough of. Some of the acting is also good.However on the other hand some of the acting was bad, and there are some plot holes, and the story itself had definate some weak points.Overall it's a big improvement over the last two movies, but it could have been a lot better still."
1,what a load of garbage,"Old George must have been high on cleaning fluid when he made this mess, how this is supposed to tie into the original 3 movies begs belief.For a start the prequel technology is far more sophisticated than the sequels, the look of the films makes it look as though they should actually have been the other way around.When you look at the lightsabre dules in the prequels, you have all the these guys flying around, yet in the sequels its more like sword fights from El Cid.Whats with all the sytuff flying around in the background, its distracting from the movie and makes you dizzy as hell, total over-use ofspecial effects, and as for the acting of Hayden and Natalie Portman, amateurish would be an understatement.The same can be said for the other 2 prequels, this just goes to show Star War fans like Trekkies will buy into anything."
5,Good closure,"I remember waiting in line to see the first Star Wars A long time ago. I must say most of the people who are into the Last 3 movies where not even alive at the time ""A New Hope"" came out.I was very disappointed in 1 and 2. The magic wasn't there and the chemistry between Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman just was not there. However, 3 did an excellant job at bridgingthe gap between the old and the new movies. Hayden was a weak Anakin in 1 and 2 but did much better in three. Over all Revengeof the Sith was very good. George Lucas could never capture the magic of Episodes 4 5 and 6 but he sure redeemed what he could from 1 and 2. Its what it is nothing more,nothing less"
1,"Boring,Very Boring",This movie is SOOOOOOOOOOO boring I had other stuff on my mind that I was thinking about during this waste of 2 hours and 28 minutes It was bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad bad. It just did not click with me this is the worst movie and Star Wars movie ever made SKIP IT. My grade over all (F-------------------)
3,"3 1/2, actually","I forgave Lucas for the mediocre ""Attack of the Clones"" because I was so excited about this movie. I even re-watched the newer movies to get ready for Revenge of the Sith. I saw it...and was some what disapointed. One reviewer said that it's a 4 hour movie crammed into 2 hours. I totally agree. Another reviewer said that you will feel bad for Vader at the end. Agreed. It leaves WAY to many questions to be answered. The final fight scene between Anikan and Obi-Wan didn't live up to the hype. Near the end Yoda says that he will tell Obi-Wan how to contact Qui-Gon through the force. We never see it happen, though."
4,I'm a Star Wars Rookie,"OK, so this was the first one I've ever seen. The only thing I know about this whole series is ""Luke, I'm your father"" and that everyone wishes Jar Jar Binks deserves to die a horrible, screaming, pus-filled death. But I can honestly say after seeing this, I might go out and watch the remaining installments. From what I've read in reviews and what people have told me, I've been able to put some of the pieces together. After hearing that Anakin turns into Darth Vader in this movie, I thought he would be just plain evil. To me, it seems like turning to the dark side was actually an honorable thing to do, he didn't like how the Jedi was handling their business. And I'm pretty sure Laya and Luke are brother and sister?? R2D2 was pretty damn funny too. I see alot of hardcore fans giving this low ratings which is understandable, this franchise is their baby, to me, it was movie I saw b/c I was on a blind date. My fave quote: ""Execute Order 66""."
5,best movie of 2005,this was by far the best movie of 2005. the best of the star wars prequels also. F**k anyone hating on star wars!
5,Perfect Ending,"First of all, do not give this film 1 or 2 stars based on your lack of Star Wars history, if you watch Star Wars 3 without seeing any of the others, of course you'll be lost and you won't enjoy the movie. This movie was so much better than the last, great job to Lucas for ending the franchise like it should be ended."
1,Disappointing...,"It's obvious George Lucas felt that by simply having the name ""Star Wars"" attached to these prequel movies they would be a hit. In my opinion, he couldn't be more wrong. Sith is the best of the three prequels, but that's like saying a Pacer is better than a Gremlin or Pinto. It's all junk. Lucas failed his audience by focusing on special effects and not the story and characters. He was once interviewed as saying ""a lot of directors fall into the trap of spending film time showing off their sets."" I guess he forgot that when making these movies. Sith moves too quickly. Anakin's turn to the dark side is so quick you could miss it if you blink. The whole REASON for the prequel trilogy was to show us the fall of Anakin Skywalker. And we get it all crammed into a few minutes of screen time? Thanks George."
5,Star Wars Episode III,This episode is a must for any Star Wars fan. It ties the whole 6 episodes together in a neat serial.
5,I wish there was one more trilogy.,"George Lucas has come a long way in special effects since Star Wars originally debuted. This dvd is the peak of tomorrows technology in special effects in a movie that will leave you breathless and wanting more. I own both trilogies, I am extremely happy that I do. It is fantastic to watch the effects improve with each movie."
5,"Star Wars - Episode III, Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)","Star Wars - Episode III, Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)~ Ahmed Best is an amazing sci-fi movie and the best of the three new Star War movies. The plot is a lot darker then the two first movies and might not be suitable for young children. The special effects are astounding and once more Lucas shows us why he is one of the best in the business. Highly recommended indeed. The scene where Anakin becomes Darth Vader is heart wrenching. This is a grand movie and I give it 5 out of 5 stars. A pity that Lucas will not make more sequels as I would have loved to see number 7, 8 and 9."
3,The New Star Wars Episodes,I didn't like the new Star Wars Episodes as well as the old ones. I thought Anakin was a whining spoiled kid. All he could do was complain about how Ben wouldn't let him do anything. Also the ending was the new Darth beside the old Yoda and Ben. They should have left the ending the same as in the old episodes. Every one older. Having the computers to enhance doesnt make for a better story line.
3,Star Wars,"The third Star Wars movie was exciting and developed the growing rift between Anakin and the Jedi council, helped along by the evil emperor. I did think it was a bit of a stretch that Anakin embraced the dark side as quickly and deeply as he did. Killing the younglings! There was nothing prior to indicate that Anakin was that heartless. On the whole, though, I thought it was well worth watching. I mean, come on. It's Star Wars."
4,visually amazing ..yet souless,no doubt lucas is a master story teller ..writin a prequel is always a tough job unless you are talented enough .though the film is visually amazin the plot is weak and bit confusing ..as there is no strong reason for anakin to transform in to darth vader if his wife was the real reason you can see that during the end he even tries to kill her ..this movie lacks the fun that u can normally see in a star wars movie and strong dialogues i wonder if lucas has anyother sequels after a series of prequels ...so what the movie still rocks and it's certainly worth a watch
3,not top 10,"Ok for the trilogy it was awesome. The end of the SW saga with a might of Darth Vadar. However, I just didn't find it to be a top 10 movie. I am a big time sci-fi fan. I watch SW, Star Trek, Macross, and Gundam. But if you compare this movie to say... Akira? GIS? or maybe even ID4? It really is more for the SW captured audience. It just simply didn't make my top 10 movies to watch."
3,Ultimately disappointing,"I'd hoped to be as ""wowed"" as I was 28 years ago when Episode IV blew into my life. While ""Sith"" is better than either Episode 1 or 2 (damning with faint praise tho' that may be) it's ultimately a disappointment. The special effects, space battles, lightsaber battles and creatures are superb;despite knowing the outcome, the battles frequently kept me on the edge of my seat. The characters are flat, Anakin seems to be suffering little more than teen angst; Padme is reduced to a teary hausfrau. Ewan MacGregor is the bright spot in the film; while saddled with the traditional stilted Lucasian dialogue he brings wit and a sparkle to Obi-Wan and it's easy to extrapolate to the twinkly eyed old desert magician we grow to love in Episode 4. I will see the movie again, as I have its predecessors but I'd hoped that George Lucas would finish his series off with a bigger bang."
2,"Was great for 2 years, now it's broken","I bought this for my office. It worked great for about 2 years. It had a little trouble finding the signal sometimes, but eventually found it.A few months ago, the batteries died. When I replaced them, the hands went around and around until the batteries died. I have moved it to several locations, but it cannot keep time anymore. I have several radio-controlled clocks and they are able to find the signal, so I know it's not the location.I am disappointed as this was my favorite clock."
3,"OK, but service life shorter than expected","If you can do this work yourself, not such a big deal that you might have to replace these more often than you'd like. My first one lasted one year, the light in the switch stopped working. The replacement one was the same model in white that lasted five years, but the switch itself failed, and I could not turn off my kitchen light. So now I'm looking at my third replacement, and I think I may try a different brand."
1,Fails to disclose bad roads,"Before we travel to a new state I always buy a DeLorme map. We like to travel the backroads to visit ""real"" country. DeLorme has always worked for us in the past.However this North Carolina map failed to reveal that what the map identified as a ""Major Connector"" unexpectedly became an unimproved unmaintained deserted road over a mountain and through a forest.If we had had car trouble or an incident on this awful stretch of road, I wouldn't be here to write this review.On other Delorme state maps they always revealed the dangerous roads, but not in this one.Location: Route 197 between Murchison and Rockview NCI can't recommend their North Carolina map."
3,"Great map, not really topograpchic","First, this book has great maps. They are very detailed. But this is not the best topographic map book. If you mean it has some faint lines showing that there is a slope, yes it has that. But they are hard to see and not real useful. If you want a feel for the terrain, this is a great book. If you want to do true land navigation, maybe not the book for you."
5,DeLorme does it right.,"If you want a phenomenal reference map set for your state, this is what you grab first. This set is for reference only - you will not be performing land navigation with grid coordinates with this map... that's what USGS topos are for. I have a DeLorme for Colorado, Nebraska, and now, North Carolina. They make planning for your next outdoor adventure a snap. Whether climbing mountains, hunting, or fishing, these maps are spot-on. Throw one in your truck for as-needed consultation. If you don't own one for your state, I highly recommend you purchase one."
4,Good to have,"We found the atlas useful for (as promised) topography, back roads, recreation sites and GPS grids, as well as major highways. Just be sure you also have detailed road maps of any areas that you will actually be visiting. Definitely worth the price."
3,North Carolina Atlas & Gazetteer (North Carolina Atlas and Gazetteer),"Bought in order to better plan my bike trips. Was disappointed to find numerous errors (2006 Edition) in street names of some main roads in my area and that the scale (1:500,000) does not allow for much detail. It does not suite my purpose and have few alternatives given we live off the usual city maps coverage. Will use it for car trips but the lack of detail and errors leaves me doubtful of its usefulness for leisure activities."
5,songs of innonence,a great book thus symbolic meaning of a child innonece reflects the attitude of a lamb who is humble meek and obebient.
5,purple liner,i have to tell you this eye liner is real nice it goes on smoot and last a long time. it makes green eyes pop
4,Excellent book,"I found this book by chance in the library. I read it for a little while, I could not put it down. I took it home. Then I will buy it. That is a good book."
5,"""GRAHAMMY"" AWARD-WINNING!","A really funny CD full of wit and charm and hilarious stories told by the late Graham Chapman of Monty Python. Recorded live in 1988. A ""Grahammy"" award-winner!"
2,Keep searching. . .,I have been searching for a baster with an injector. This one looked good. It works OK with the injector but it does not work at all as a regular baster. I guess I will keep searching.
4,Very interesting documentary,I saw this after I saw the movie End of the Spear. It was very imformative and interesting to see the perceptions of the wives and friends. It was also very emotional to watch what they went through. I recommend watching this movie in conjunction with End of the Spear.
4,good show,"the story is very good, they cover it well, in both the short and long versions. there are some times when it is hard to hear Steve's voice, because of the background music, and his soft voice..."
5,A real blessing.,"If someone is not a Christian, I would guess that this DVD is not for them. Non believers cannot possibly fathom the urge to evangelize.If you are a Christian, and I mean a real evangelical with a living relationship with The Son, this film will be a real blessing. No further explanation is necessary. If you are not a believer, I would not recommend it, you will scratch your head and be eternally baffled."
1,Definitely worth watching,"This true story, as relayed by the characters who were actually involved in the events, is very thought provoking and impactful. Their words and experiences should not be allowed to fade into the past--thier story should be told and retold and not forgotten."
3,Secularized presentation of a Christian story,"This documentary assumes that you have seen the movie, or at least you know what it is all about. If you haven't, or you don't, then you will probably have some trouble following the dramatis personae of this drama. It starts in medias res, that is, there is no preparation or introduction. You have many Indians telling you pieces of the story, mentioning people's names that you don't have any idea who they are. Then come the missionaries (one assumes they are Christians, though this point wasn't made that explicit either) talking about such and such. By minute 30 I still didn't know who was who, or who was married to whom, etc. Very aggravating. I got the story alright. But the presentation is, I regret to say, very poor and disorganized.I also agree with Michael M. Long (another reviewer) that this is practically a secularized account of a Christian missionary story. Disappointing."
4,Beyond the Gates of Splendor,"This is a very good follow up to ""End of the Spear"", with interviews of the real missionary families from that DVD."
3,An Interesting Story But A Bit Hard To Follow At Times,"""Beyond the Gates of Splendor"" was worth watching but was confusing at times due to the number of people interviewed. I would have appreciated seeing the people's names on the screens each time they spoke throughout the documentary (noting the relationships to the other people would have been helpful, too). It is also interesting that there was very little mention of the theology of the missionaries or exactly what they attributed the change in the Auca Indians to. It seems strange to make a documentary about martyred missionaries and not talk more about their mission! There is more time spent interviewing anthropologists than ministers or theologians. I think that if the filmmakers would have slowed the pace of the narrative down and not tried to include as much as they did they could have made a harder hitting documentary that better addressed the question of why? instead of who? what? where? and when?"
3,Beyond the gates of splendor,I was not crazy about the making of this movie because the story was a bit hard to follow at times.
4,Beyond the Gates of Splendor,"A Family, Christian movie that goes the distance. Faith, courage, comfort, shelter. Such courageous men and women of God and families of such great strength and having such a heart for God and His ministry. How God will use each of us if we are willing and able. What a testimony to their love for God and his purpose in life!"
4,Very easy to get the garbage bag out of.,"This is plastic, so it's not as durable as the stainless steel one we used to have...but I love it! The stainless steel one was soooo hard to get the bag out of. I broke so many bags yanking on it and shaking the heavy can to get it out. This one doesn't get over filled and slides out as smooth as butter. The flippy top gets a tad bit annoying when the can is full, but that just lets me know it is time to change it out before it gets over full. It is the perfect size for the tall kitchen trash bags. My two year old daughter has loved just spinning and spinning the top over and over. It's funny. The top can look dirty easy but is VERY easy to just spray and wipe off. I don't have to contend with the stainless steel finish that was a pain to clean and got dirty a lot easier. So for the $16 dollars I spent, I would make the decision to buy it 98 out of 100 times!"
3,"Good product, bad packaging/shipping","The product is great, but the packaging was very disappointing. The quality of the can itself is as stated in other reviews--the lid opening is a bit small to scrape plates, but the look and size work well in my kitchen, so I'm pleased. The sides are quite ridged. The top, albeit plastic is of the quality I expected, and works well.However, it was shipped in a box 2x the size of the can, and arrived scratched and scraped up; so, this maybe of concern to some, but the position in my kitchen leaves the sides somewhat concealed, so not a huge issue for me."
3,10 gallon black waste can,"This is a good product, looks nice, and is easy to use. However, I had gotten it for a kitchen waste can and found it too big for a single person. It's best for outdoor use on a patio or in a big kitchen where a lot of trash is generated."
1,No lid included,No removable lid included in the box! The product description and photo claims that the lid is included in the price.
3,Trash Bin,"The swinging thing on the cap is completely useless. It falls off (into the trash where it belongs) with minimum pressure applied to it. Take it off and you have an altogether better trash bin, much easier to throw trash into. Does its job as a trash bin, but I'm going to be looking for something that inhibits odors better."
3,10-gallon waste can,"Nice little waste can. Be sure you know what 10 gallons means before you buy it. It is MUCH smaller than the kitchen trash can I replaced....and therefore way too small for our household of two, and I often need to dump it twice a day. We need one twice as big for our kitchen, sadly, but it is of good quality."
5,Waste Can,Have looked at local brick and mortar stores and no luck in finding the right item. It works well and matches the colors in my kitchen.
2,Waste of a waste can.,"You get what you pay for, for $22 bucks this cheaply made waste can came and the top doesn't attach properly to the lid.It always falls off, and it seriously is the most irritating things ever. One of the main features is the way the lid opens and closes, but when the feature ultimately fails....there is not much to praise other than it holds trash....."
2,a lot smaller than it looks,this was a lot smaller than it appeared on amazon. it also didn't come with the lid? pretty disappointed in that aspect.
1,Looks very cheap,"I bought this item a couple of days ago. It's not ""metallic white"", it's just plastic white. In fact it's a bit transparent so you'll actually see the trash-bag through the plastic. In addition the lid doesn't look nearly as good as it does in the picture. Rather than being convex shaped, it's concave which looks very weird. A very bad product."
1,Wrong Item,"The item I received was not the item that was pictured in the ad. Even worse, the seller did not bother to return my message requesting an RMA. Thumbs down. I do NOT recommend this seller."
2,"does what it says, but . . .","The Egg piercer does exactly that and it does lock so that the tiny needle is not always exposed to wandering hands in the gadget drawer, but I can't say that my eggs cook any better with using it than without. Without it, you take the chance that the eggs will crack in the boiling process. With the egg piercer, you can count on some leakage from the egg every time. I use it because I have it; if I didn't and I know what I know now, I'm not sure I'd go ahead and buy it. It is cute."
3,"does the job ,but ...","Having searched the gamut ,this was the only appliance which could come close to doing the job ~ prob exists w/ slide action ,that seems to stick after usage [can be partially solved by adding a couple drops olive oil]"
4,Great Little Item,"I have used an egg cooker for many years and sometimes the eggs crack, so I purchased this handy little gadget and now I get no cracked eggs when they are removed from the egg cooker. Easy to use and perfect eggs every time. Just wish it had a magnet on it to just toss it up on the side of my fridge for easy access to it. But the drawer isn't that far away to store it. :-) This is a great little item."
1,"I first though it was ok, upon more use--it's horrible","well, the thing that punches the holes is too big and has already shattered 2 out of 10 eggs, Also it's completely sealed so you can't clean the egg or anything else out of it that spills in it. It's this second part that really grosses me out. Why would you make something that comes in contact with raw chicken stuff that you can't clean and disinfect? If the egg crushes while trying to pierce it how do you clean the raw egg out? (it doesn't come apart and the base is sealed?)"
1,Not sure what all the fuss is about,"I boil about a half dozen eggs every few days. Peeling them has either gone really easily, or sometimes really hard and frustrating, and it was about a fifty/fifty split. So I bought this little gadget thinking it would make a big difference and make peeling every egg easy. Not the case. First of all almost all the eggs cracked after boiling despite the product description claiming there would be little to no cracking, and second the eggs are absolutely not easier to peel. Just like before the egg piercing, it's still about every other egg that is difficult to peel. At least I didn't waste a lot of money trying this product out.Want perfectly hard-cooked eggs every time? Place four eggs in the pot and fill with water until the eggs are just covered. Bring to a boil, remove pot from heat source and cover the pot for twelve minutes. Take out eggs and enjoy! This method ensures eggs are neither over cooked nor under cooked."
4,Great but miss the magnet!,I had one of these extremely handy gadgets for probably ten years until it fell to the floor and smashed. I was complaining about not having it one day so my daughter immediately searched Amazon and found one. I am thrilled to have one again but this model doesn't have a magnet which my original model did. The magnet allowed me to store it always within reach on the metal hood in my kitchen. I'm going to try adding some magnetic tape to rectify the situation. Otherwise it is an awesome tool that allows you to make perfect eggs every time.
5,Pierce the LARGE end,"One of my favorite kitchen tools!! I keep it on the window sill above the sink. Easy to use for arthritic hands -- use a light touch. I place it in the sink to use it, mindful of the occasional weak shell, no mess. Piercing the large end where the air bubble is lets the egg expand and not crack. Place eggs in cold running water to cool, no peeling issues. I bought a bunch of these for gifts and am now buying more. A real kitchen gem."
5,Handy kitchen utensil to stop shattering eggs,Works as advertised. Great for soft boiled and hard boiled eggs. No busted eggs at the bottom of the pot when cooking.
2,Great when it works - but far too flaky,The GOOD news is that this is a full featured GPS solution that is easy to mount in the car and can navigate to contacts in your address book. Maps are detailed and the POI (Point of Interest) database is fairly extensive.The BAD news is that it all too often fails to connect via Bluetooth. Installation of software and maps is error prone (do not follow any of the 'advanced' hints in the manual - they scrambled my SD card).Only buy this product if you like puzzle solving and have a great deal of patience. If you are expecting an out of the box solution that is 100% reliable - look elsewhere.
2,Terrible OnLine Support-TomTom Navigator on Palm Life Drive,"I've had Navigator on my LifeDrive for 3 weeks. At first I downloaded all the maps that I wanted onto my pc but when I hotsync'd it would hang. I submitted a question to TomTom and never heard back from them. I finally figured out how to delete the files from my pc and reinstalled using the ""Other maps"" option and only installed one state which worked. Once I started using it in my car, my Palm would find the TomTom GPS device less than 25% of the time. I updated my question on TomTom's site explaining the new problem and here I am 3 weeks later returning the product. Their support is horrible! Palm got back to me right away and suggested that I get a replacement but I am not willing to run into another problem down the road and have to deal with TomTom's lack of support again. You can also send a complaint but the address is in the Netherlands. When it worked, it was great but unfortunately it did not work enough."
1,DO NOT PURCHASE,"I am a general contractor on Nantucket and am always trying to source different items through different retailers and distributors. I can say that these items are complete garbage. The way that these units are designed and constructed will lead ALL of them to fail. I installed 20+ in one cottage, and within 5 days, 14 had literally fallen apart. Their is no reason to ever purchase these. If you like the style of sash lock, as I do, purchase the ones made my IVES. They are solid brass and have a completely different construction but nearly identical look."
4,"Reply to ""mcloud262""","You think boys singing about God is funny, eh? Well let me tell u somethin', even tho I don't have the album, I think those boys have a good message to sing about the everlasting love of God. So if u think THAT'S so hilarious, you're SICK! DON'T TAKE PEOPLE STANDING UP FOR GOD JOKINGLY!! WHO'S LAUGHING NOW??"
5,Christian Music at it's BEST!,"AMAZING! That is the one word that comes to mind when I first heard this CD. They are so incredibly unique and you can tell that there's a thirst for God in their hearts! Five boys- ages 14 to 19 who not only play their own instruments but wrote the lyrics and music to every song in this CD. I was so impressed, I went and saw them live in concert. If anything, it's 3 times better than the CD! These five are truly blessed by God and each have amazing talents. Phat Chance has a very unique pop/rock sound in each of their songs. Very appealing to the teenage audience and can relate better than any group I've seen. This is one CD you don't have to skip songs on! Definately worth buying!"
5,Uniquely beautiful and happy music,"After 35 years of listening almost only to classical music, I have embarked on an ear- and mind-opening exploration of other music. This disc has been among the most rewarding. Every piece is tuneful, happy, interesting, and unique. It is hard not to keep listening over and over and over. It is a desert island disc."
1,way too much,"Since there is only 2 episodes on the tape, the price is so far out in left field, its not worth anything. I know that Alex Mack is not playing anymore, and that you cannot find that often, but charging over $5 is ripping you off. I used to watch this as a kid, and I love it, but Im not going to waste that much money on it when I found it on DVD non the less, for only $40, and its every episode. I give this one star, because I cant go lower, youre ripping people off, and theyre just not smart enough to realize it."
5,I HAVE/NT SEEN THIS VIDEO BUT WHY CAN/T THE PEOPLE ABOVE,I HAVE NOT SEEN THIS MOVIE BUT WHY CANT THE PEOPLE ABOVE WRITE ABOUT IT. ALLS THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT IS HOW BEAUTIFUL SHE IS. IJUST WANT TO HERE A LITTLE ABOUT THE VIDEO.
1,Boo!!,"I am not impressed woth this game. Poor graphics, poor gameplay, and not very fun. No one will really enjoy this title, as it is just not very fun. It is fustrating, and there is not enough replay value. Maybe this will work on the Game Boy Advance, but it sure doesn't fly here."
4,Fun video,"My son loves Jimmy Neutron. I encouraged watching Jimmy because he is a ""genius."" It is mostly just entertaining fun."
4,"Science A.S.A.P., Alan Axelrod.","""Typically, the things others overlook or take for granted are precisely what draw the attention of the scientist."" If you'd like to know how Eratosthenes calculated the Earth's diameter (accurate to within a few hundred miles, by the way) ca. 200BC, Axelrod's concise (""As Simple As Possible"") book will explain it in a few quick paragraphs. Wondering what Mendel's ""laws of inheritance"" are? Curios about Maxwell's mathematical unification of electricity and magnetism? Axelrod presents simple answers in two or three paragraphs. This is a nice little resource for the non-specialist, and even the specialist might be pleased with the simplicity and economy."
4,Jimmy Webb's Dionne Warwick,"Can you say Jimmy Webb had a Bacharach complex? I think so with this entry. IMHO, it seems like Webb was looking for his very own Dionne to sing his music. With that said, this is a great classic album,and very hard to find. Being a 5th Dimension fan, I still prefer Florence Larue's version of ""This Is Your Life"" over Ms.Houston's."
3,Great Topic- Not Well Made,"This was not very well made. I was glad I rented this one rather than bought it. It was not in depth, but even in the short section on Ida B Well for instance it would use the same footage or picture again. They are not high quality. Narration changes,poor graphics on the credits, it is just a B production. Some A+ documentaries on Black history are Roots of Resistance, Africans in America, Citizen King, Murder of Emmett Till, Eyes on the Prize, Slavery by another Name..."
5,Teaching tool,I purchased this radio for my son for Christmas. It only took him a week .It was easy to build and it worked when it was done. This was not his first electronic kit but it was easy to build and soldering was not too difficult. There were some mistakes on the board but I still plan on buying him the AM/FM radio next
3,It is a kit,"I was hoping to see RF signals with my oscilloscope, but one 3 pin component does a bunch of the RF to audio signal processing that it did not allow me to see what I wanted. It had all the parts and clear instructions. It might be good to get elementary school kids interested in electronics by ""building"" there own radio."
4,nice,"The cross is nice, but beware of the chain. It is very thin. I bought a replacement for it or otherwise, I would have had to buy a new pendant as well."
2,Looks great - not sturdy,"We bought this item when we moved into our house three years ago. I looked really good and I had looked far and wide to find just the right entertainment center. However, it is really heavy and we had to move it a little a few times and the legs started to break off so it is not moved at all anymore. Also the big drawer on bottom holds a lot of movies but the flimsy board they sit on sags in the middle and 90% of the time when it is shut we cannot get it open without peeling the back of the entertainment center off to lift the bottom of the drawer. So buy at your own risk."
4,Entertainment Center,"The color of this unit is beautiful. I was very surprise with the storage room available. Lots! The instructions were a bit hard to follow when assembling it, but we managed and I am happy with the results."
5,"Big and heavy, but effective","I run a Core 2 Duo e8400 (3.0GHz) overclocked to 3.6GHz, 5 HDs, 2 DVD burners, GTX 285, 750W PS, etc... so a lot of heat in my case. With only one 120mm silent fan on the heatsink itself, and another two for case exhaust, the highest my cores got was 64C under torture testing in Prime95. Not bad for a mostly silent PC! When idling, it's usually no more than low to mid 40's - and the case (Antec P180) is whisper quiet.Being so heavy I sometimes worry about it losing contact or dislodging from the CPU/MB when I move my case, but I don't move it often - and it's held up every time I do, but I'd recommend moving it gently.Overall terrific product, although I believe reading about slightly better coolers out there by now."
5,"""THE GOODS""!!!","WELL ALL AS I CAN SAY- EACH SONG WILL BRING BACK MEMORIES SUCH AS ""DON'T LOOK ANY FURTHER"" DON'T DISTURB THIS GROOVE ETC.. THIS WAS WELL WORTH THE PRICE ALL THE REST OF THE VOLUMES ""CLASSIC MELLOW"" ARE JUST AS WELL THE ""GOODS"""
4,Excellence and reliability,"I was not that happy with a scented ball, but the technology on this ball prove me wrong. I even love the scent on it! :)On medium oil to dry, this ball perform really well. I'm a intermediate player, who just bumped 15 pins in his average to 160, in about 2 months. Simply amazing.Highly recommended"
4,Good Product,"I love how large it is and that it is zippered. My complaints though are you can't see what the DVDs are, since the only see thru part is where you can put the DVD notes. Like other reviews, I like the strap feature versus the binder, but it is a bit time consuming if you want to rearrange it. Since you have to take all previous sheets out, and then of course put them all back. But the straps won't bend out of shape like a ring binder could."
1,DVB-200 is huge & I hate it,"Ugh! The DVB-200 is a monstrosity. It is 7.5-inches thick/deep. That may not sound like much, but to me, that makes it the elephant-of-CD-binders. When filled with CDs, this binder would weigh a ton. I hate it."
2,TOO large of a case - not meant for traveling,"I was very disappointed when this Case Logic case arrived. I didn't realize how large it would be. I was looking for something we could take on trips with us to hold our kids' DVD's. This case is NOT meant for traveling it is meant to keep at your home. I would think it would be too cumbersome to sift through as far as organizing your home movies, but maybe it works for people. I am returning it and I purchased a different one that I am hoping will be MUCH smalled and easier to take when we travel. My advice - definitely look at the dimensions to see if this is the size you truly want. It literally would take up the space of a carry-on piece of luggage (just to give you an idea of its size).Caselogic DVB-200 200 CD/DVD and 92 Liner Note Capacity (Black)"
1,"A great idea, pathetically executed.","This thing is an extraordinarily expensive piece of junk. The case is designed so that holding it by the handle causes the disks to slip out of their pockets. And the zipper is so awkward to operate, it's no wonder it broke. One has to wrestle the two flaps closed at the bottom edge, while its design is trying to force them open.Save your money, keep your DVD cases & buy a shelf."
2,a disappointment,"What a disappointment! I ordered this, hoping for the 3-ring binder version in the photo, which has been discontinued and can no longer be found in stores, but instead I received the strap-hinge version. Totally worthless, because the straps become brittle and break within a relatively short period of time.It would help alot if the picture were changed, so as not to mislead others.Also, I ordered and paid for two, but received only one. Not good business practice."
2,Buyer Beware,The item pictured is not the item I received. The rivets are visible...the handle is not recessed as the one pictured. I have several of those and this one is more cheaply made and not as sturdy. At least I can use the pages out of it to put in the others but was disappointed.
5,DVD Wallet is a great idea,"Choosing a DVD to view used to be a hassel - crouching down to view DVD cases in a storage cabinet then sorting through the titles in various fonts and graphics to make choices. Invariably, my beloved spouse would nix the ones chosen, so back to the fetal postion to replace the DVDs alphabetically...The CASE LOGIC DVD WALLET is a dream come true! After some time with a scissors to trim some of the jackets to enable a good fit in the jacket holder, I now have an organized collection which enables a quick perusal of all the choices. Be aware that each page only has two jacket holders, but space for four DVDs. If you wish to keep the jackets, plan on a capacity of 70 DVDs."
1,bad description!!!,the picture is a binder with a 3 hole punch and the actual product is just the 2 strips!
3,Dislike the New Design,"I have several of these wallets for my DVDs. The older version has metal three-ring binders. The new design allows quick access, but only to the DVDs in the front. If you want to add any pages, you have to remove the pages in the front; in other words, if you want to add to the back of the book, you have to remove all of the pages! I find this very irritating."
4,Efficiency nut,This is the best solution so far for storing DVDs. I tried the DVB80 for a week and it was too cumbersome to handle and virtually impossible to organize. The DVB40 is easy to access and still a huge space saver.
5,Easy & Expandable,This product is very versatile. Compact storage for a lot of DVD or Cds. It's easy and expandable with extra sleeves which can be ordered. The front of the pages allow you to keep the original paper cover from the hard case.
4,Close to perfect,"This is perfect for compacting that growing mess of a dvd collection. It would be perfect if the slip pockets for the dvd covers were just a wee bit wider. Also, put a clear slot on the binding for a label to be inserted."
3,"Good quality, difficult to re-roganize","This product is high quality. However, unlike the typical binders, if you want to re-arrange some pages, you will need to remove all of the pages, re-arrange them to your preference and re-insert them.The three ring binder approach is easier for re-organization."
3,DVD Case,"I like that this case holds the DVD covers, but I DO NOT like the new binder design. It was much easier with the rings. Now that it has the plastic fold loops, you have to remove all the pages to insert or move other pages. It is very time consuming."
3,SOME GOOD - SOME BAD,"I have the 200 capacity and the smaller version. The bad: The zippers are hard to get started and the engineer who came up with the Case Logic strap system should be shot. A standard 3-ring binder beats their system hands-down. Each sheet holds 4 DVDs but only the outer slots have flaps to hold the DVDs in. The inner ones have a tendance to come out. Additional sheets seem to be somewhat overpriced and hard to find. The good: I like the cover material, the fact that I can put the (trimmed down) DVD covers in with the DVDs, the large capacity, and that the front face is large enough so that I can attach a standard sheet protector with double sided tape and keep an alphabetical index on the outside of the case. However, if I could have found something better (and I looked), I would have bought it. But after writing this review, I'm going to buy another one."
2,Could be much better,This item no longer comes in a traditional 3 ring binder style. The current style makes it difficult to remove single pages from the middle or back of the folder.Just buy the refill pages and put them in a cheap 3 ring binder from your local office supply.
1,The Picture isn't right for this product!,"I ordered this product because the picture showed that it is a 3-ring binder style. Unfortunately, that is NOT the case. The product I received was actually the quick lock style. The reason that I want the 3-ring style and not the quick lock is that I like to be able to add and remove pages easily from any place in the binder.This is not possible with the quick lock style. If you want to add or remove anything, you have to remove all the pages up to the point of where you're making the change. This is very inconvenient compared to the 3-ring style."
4,Would be a 5 if the holding system was better,"I like this binder. It's great for organizing all our DVDs and it cuts down on the amount of space taken up by my kids' DVDs. I generaly get two DVD titles per sheet and have fitted many more refill sheets into the binder. My main problem with it is once organized (mine are in alphabetical order)it is difficult to reorganize because of the annoying straps as described by others below. I much prefer the 3 ring binder format, which I have in the smaller, single title per sheet binder.The Amazon descriptions are very misleading because in some of the large double sheet binders, they show both the straps and 3 rings so you don't know what you'll be getting."
2,This product poorly/inaccurately described!!,"Having bought this I am disappointed to say that IT IS NOT 3 RING. It has the 2 straps as shown in the photo. It is not ""a snap"" to add pages and alphabetize your collection. I would buy another for the rest of our collection if it wasn't for that. Adding and removing pages is a HUGE hassle. Given it's size I like the carrying handle and the slots in the inside front cover for putting away discs quickly if you or more likely a lazy child does not want to search through the pages to put it back into its correct slot. Because of the zip closure you can also keep booklets that will not fit in the sleeves, in the binder without them falling out."
4,Not for the collector who organizes alphabetically.,"This Caselogic DVD storage system works very well. The sleeve material will not scratch the disk surface and each page has pouches for 2 liner notes. The construction is sturdy and durable, and it looks good. However, the page release mechanism is very clumsy and is a pain to use if you re-organize/add new movies to your collection frequently. This is not the storage system for people who like to arrange movies in alphabetical order."
3,Review of DVB40,"Its a pretty good product. Although Case Logic changed the format of the sleeves from a three ring to a two strap binder, it does the job. But if you like to keep thinks orderly and have to change or re-arrange sleeves, its a big pain in the neck. I don't know what they were thinking at Case Logic when they made this change."
2,"Cheap ""upgrade"", stick with older model.","I have 4 of the previous model: Case Logic DVB-140 142 CD/DVD and 62 Liner Note Capacity http://www.amazon.com/Case-Logic-DVB-140-Liner-Capacity/dp/B0009JR5RI/ref=cm_cr_pr_product_topThe DVB-140 has a nice, sturdy faux ""leather"" cover. The new version has a filmsy, nylon cover. The product image looks similar to the previous model, however, in person the new one looks very cheap. The DVB-200 has a larger capacity than the DVB-140. Unfortunately, the binder has been made so large that it is unwieldy. If you own the DVB-140, I would suggest purchasingCase Logic DVP-10 Album Refill 4-DVD Page (5-Pack)refill pages instead of the new version."
2,Read carefully,"I was under the impression this would hold 200 DVD's. It will but, you will have to put dvd's behind liners that they don't go with. In other words there are two slots behind each liner holder. This is great if you have 92-two disc movies or bonus disks to go with the movie. Otherwise this is a 92 DVD holder. Once the DVD is in the slot you cannot tell what it is, same for the ones in the front cover. Also, this thing is HUGE! Mine cam with a 2"" rip in the back so I returned it for that."
4,Good Space Saver,"This was purchased to get rid of all my dvds lying around. It is a great setup, your able to put the DVDs and the original artwork in the only problem I have with the case is that it is difficult to sip back up because it is so large. Good purchase tho."
3,Bought a 3-ring Binder,"I bought two of these. After I put some 20 different titles in the wallet (the dvd on the left, the liner on the right), I realised that if I wanted to add into my wallet (which is alphabetised), I'd have to reshift ALL the dvds either before or after it.So now, it's organised in such a way that the liner is on the right and the accompanying dvd is behind it. But because this is not a 3-ring binder, you have to remove all the dvds before a title to insert it alphabetically, as the other reviewers have bemoaned.So then I searched Amazon to find this: www.amazon.com/Avery-27554-Durable-Reference-capacity/dp/B0006HV8V2/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s;=office-products&qid;=1214098565&sr;=8-1Since the dvd sleeves are three-hole punched, they will fit into this 3 ring binder (which does not zip close). I think I will purchase this binder and just chuck the wallet.The only unfortunate thing is I bought two wallets; I should have just bought the refills/inserts & a three-ring binder...."
1,Warning! - Not as pictured!,Be warned - what you get in the mail is not what is pictured in the photos!!! You do not get the pages that fit two liner notes!
3,It's huge!!,"I like the concept, but it is so big and awkward. It definitely does not need to be as large as it is, and it's not the highest quality. I kept it for about a month and then donated it because it is more inconvenient than having a bunch of DVD cases."
4,Great for DVD storage,"I thought that the Case Logic storage unit was very good. It's a little bulky when filled to capacity, but that's understandable.The zipper could be better designed to make it easier to zip when it is full, but all-in-all, a very good design.I'm going to get a second one shortly to hold my TV episode collections.UPDATE: Love the sleeves, but not really the holders. So, I'm buying 3-ring binders, which will also hold the sleeves. (There are ring-holes in the sleeves that allow this. Good thinking by Case Logic) I'm going to sort my movies into type. (Drama, Sci-fi, Comedy, etc.) Makes it less cumbersome.If you need refill sheets, do what one reviewer said--buy the whole thing. It winds up being cheaper than buying the refill sleeves. Already bought several of these Case Logic binders for the pages."
4,"Good product, but inconvenient to remove or add pages","The product serves its purpose well, but it is a real pain to add or remove pages."
5,Amazing,"This product is amazing and keeps the DVDs free from scratches and dust. easy access to the disks and Sleeve Covers. Binder is durable, sturdy and water resistant. Even has extra space to add more sleeves!!"
3,"works, but why so exspensive","Works as advertised, but why are they so expensive? At this price I can't afford to migrate my entire collection over."
4,Portable Space Saver,It is a great space saver. I travel and like to bring one binder along to watch movies on my laptop. I have many binders and never found problems with the zipper or carry handle. It's true that a 200 disc binder is only about 100+ but putting sequals together in one sleeve helps. Never found anything better than this design and the plastic straps hold better than the 3 hole punch method.
3,DVD holder,I was excited I thought I found what I wanted at a good price. When it came in the mail it was not what I thought it was. It only holds one movie per page I wanted the bigger one that holds two movies per page I wish it would have said that I would not have bought it and would have keep looking for what I wanted.
3,DVD's constantly fall,"This case is an awesome concept;however, the DVD's CONSTANTLY fall out of the holders. No matter how far I shove them in or even if I pull the flap over, if I grab the book and turn the page I'm bound to find a DVD or 2 out of their slot."
2,Doesn't hold 200 adequately,"The product description failed to tell you that the ""200 capacity"" is not adequate. The sleeves are designed to hold two DVD covers or inserts in the slot, then on the back there is room for 2 discs per slot. The slits for the discs are a cheap black material so you cannot visibly see the disc. If you have a DVD with double discs this is ideal. If, like most DVDs there is just one disc it would not make sense to fill up the other slot with a second, totally different DVD which you can not properly display the cover. So, in actuality this case holds approximately half of what it claims. Unless you would like to pull out each DVD individually to see what is in each slot. Not practical. Also, this is not real leather; it is pleather- fake and stinks like plastic. Other than that this is great for saving space and throwing out those old cases."
2,"Poor quality, bulky, diffifult to switch out pages.","I just returned this dvd case. It's needlessly bulky, the sleeves seem very likely to tear, and taking pages in or out is a trial. Even zipping up the case is awkward. Like other reviewers, I will just use my own 3 ring binders and buy pages of better quality."
2,Great Storage Poor Operation,"We collect a lot of DVD's! I was quite excited to file them in this system. We have a smaller version that DOES have the three rings. Huge mistake in changing that. It is extremely difficult to file in DVD's in this storage system (the smaller one is great). Also, to ensure the movie is protected we like to place the whole sleeve on top of the player and then refile after viewing. Can't do that with this system. Buy the pages individually and put them in your own three ring binder."
2,Upgrade is a downgrade,"Case Logic has completely changed the DVB-40. It now holds only 21 liner notes instead of 25, and 48 DVDs instead 40. Every page holds two discs, which is kind of a waste since a good number of DVDs only come with one disc, and there are six slots on the front which I still haven't found a use for. They've also replaced the 3 metal rings with some band thing which makes it difficult to remove the pages. To the outside they've added brown thread which I don't particularly like. It's still a space saver, but no longer as convenient or stylish as it once was. I'll be finding another DVD Wallet when it's time to expand my collection."
3,Good product. Poor packaging.,The two 4 1/2 lb jugs were shipped in a flimsy box. The lids on both jugs came off. The box was full of hand cleaner. Quite a mess. Due to the poor packaging I can't recommend buying.
5,Excellent Cleaner,Been using GOJO for 25+ years...works great and willcontinue to buy it...to me the original formula is the best one.
2,Box was full of handsoap!,"The product itself is great ,the packaging not so good. When I opened the box the lids had come off the containers and the box was full of handsoap."
3,Okay for a gamers rerun,"This game is a repeat of many others exceptin this game has a LOOK I AM DIFFERRENT name.(A dud running around shooting up the land. UNnatural, as to getting killed, wounded or what ever..too super man..."
2,not as good as the four seasons,I bought this video for my daughter who loves the four seasons one as well as the baby einstein videos. But I put it in a few times and she had no interest what so ever. Everything seemed kind of blah through the whole thing.
2,Notorious Failure,"I personal am a great fan of the Original Notorious by THC Muzik.Why is it that the track was suh a hit and yet these so called producers Kirk Hedge and Piloni have goneand reproduced the track and have done a horible job if I DO SAY SO.The track should not have been touche it should have been released the same wy that we the fans heard it Originally nd had come to love.I personally give it a two thumbs down as I think it's a disrespect to the Original producers GIZE,AMLAK and HABTE OF THC Muzik."
4,A passable Norma at a great price,"This is not an exciting recording of Norma, but the price is great for a good cast that gives a decent performance. Missing is the passionate acting that one finds in Callas or Sills. Eaglen takes time to warm up so that Casta Diva, coming early in the opera, is a disappointment. She definitely sounds better as the opera progresses. If you're on a tight budget, this is not a bad rendition of Norma to own."
2,All wrong,"Eaglen is perhaps the worst Norma on disc. Horrible coloratura, pinched high notes, lax phrasing and ZERO characteristation. (Compared to her Dame Joan Sutherland acts as wonderfully as Bette Davis!) Eaglen, a lyric soprano (Perfect for Mimi, Liu etc.) is pressed into those ""huge"" role because of her looks. BIG Isolde, Brünnhilde, Norma etc. which is ridiculous. Her last runs as Norma at the MET were disastrous. Mei is a lovely Adalgisa, hence the two stars."
3,Average Rating,The book is okay for people who are brand new and don't know anything about the toastmasters organization. The book is not great but it is also not bad.
5,Love the Bumpy Track!,"My son received this as a gift and he LOVES the bumpy track. When setting up his Thomas tracks, the first thing he asks is, ""Where will we put the bumpy track, Mama?"" He loves driving the trains over it. Although it is certainly not a ""must have"" item, it is definitely a lot of fun. As always the Learning Curve Thomas tracks are extremely durable, so I'm sure they will last a very long time."
3,Wacky track is better,"There is absolutely nothing wrong with the bumpy track but if you are tossing up between this and the wacky track, the wacky track is much more useful and fun."
4,Nice addition but very long!,My two year old loves towatch his trains (especially the battery operated ones) bump along the bumpy track. My only problem is that they are so long. We have quite a few destinations (as well as the deluxe roundhouse) so space is at a premium and it's hard to find a place for the bumpy track.
5,BVS Blu-Ray,"Please please please give us the entire Buffy the Vampire Slayer in blu-ray! It's been years since its' last season, plenty of time! What is wrong with you people? We are waiting for Buffy!"
4,"Good Video's, but DVD is annoying","I liked the videos, you can see a list of them above, but the dvd is really annoying cause you can only view one video at a time. I have looked all over and can't find a ""VIEW ALL"" method, so you have to select the next video after one ends."
5,HHH = love,"""le le low"" is a greaaat song. i love the guitar in it, and the beat always makes me want to dance. In ""have a good sleep"" the singer does little high note sort of yelps : ]and like all all of HHH's songs the lyrics are always so witty and incredibly creative. the sound on this EP is so unique, and like no other artits i've hear before.in ""Touch you, touch you"" it's hard to get the lyrics right in the beginning. but i think the vocals in this song sound really really great. ""5 times out of 100"" at first reminded me a little one of their first albums ""scenes one through thirteen"" in terms of the keyboard. this song is really energetic and my favorite part is about 3/4 of the way through it when the song slows down a bit.""More for show"" is great and of course has amazing lyrics like "" a dollhouse drawn in sand. the random lack of dirty hands"". and it's a complete feel good song."
3,Modest companion,"This ep released around the same time might try as hard as the debut but does lack alot of the songwriting verve that made the original striking, playing out more like a collection of throwaway tracks from the first session."
2,the fall of an idol,"errol flynn refused to work in another great movie that was made by stewart granger,just to do this average movie.it is minor role and very desapointing to flynn's fans.the man who did robin hood was not the same. but is a chance to see the great errol flynn, and i think it's enough.."
3,Learn How to Hypnotize!!,"did Kipling go into detail bout this method of mind control??? found it most interesting and that if you were headstrong you would still be found out... great thriller for a location based film and fascinating to see the newly formed India, but still Colonial mega presence and then the Soviets want in??? felt bad for the country, so poor but proud and fighting incessantly to survive... the adventures of a child who has no desire for a boring education and bravely charges in dangerous territory as a spy, captivating, inspiring with the holy pilgrimmage to the River, expected to see more Erol given his top billing and maybe saw him jump twice so his calmed down role was a plus imho... recommend for childhood adventure and rare footage of early India..."
3,"""Memories are made of this..:""","I adore the book. I saw the film years ago . And I wanted to see it again as I got nice souvenirs. I still like it, but of course it is a bit old fashioned. And I do not like the way they sometimes altered the story . ABD"
2,The TV Version Was Better,"After reading the book, I thought I'd see how it translated into a movie, so I bought two versions: This version with Errol Flynn and the TV version with Peter O'Toole. This version is typical of the times, meaning Indian characters that didn't speak or look like Indians, terrible special effects, and a mangling of the plot. The TV version is better, but still not great."
2,I recommend the Peter O'toole Kim over this one.,"i did not like this version and recommend the peter otoole version over this one. Neither one is as good as the book, and i was disappointed."
4,pleasant surprise.,"Okay, I admit I didn't think I would like Skillet's new cd Alien Youth, but once I put it in my cd player it's been there ever since. Like anyone I go through my musical phases. Sometimes I want to rock out, others I need quiet and peaceful tunes like during my bible study and prayer. This cd really has it all.The song ""Will You Be There"", is a deep song that personally reminds me of some of my prayers. The words are moving such as, ""As I fall to sleep, will you comfort me?.........When me heart is weak, will you rescue me?"" This song is a beautiful reminder of how God takes care of you. Another moving song ""Come My Way"" is from a day in the life of a lost person. In the song a desparate person is praying that Jesus heals them. It is a wonderful example of faith.All in all this cd has much to offer, with rockin' songs like ""Alien Youth"" and ""Kill me, Heal me"". If you don't own this cd you should."
4,Skillet rocks; but some lack of originallity,"Skillet succeeds again with this great release. I love all the songs; besides, Alien Youth. I think it's a pretty good song, but it reminds you a lot of Jesus Freak (dc Talk). (...) It may just be me, though. But overall this album is worth the purchase!"
4,"A Contrast, but a good one...","Another winner cd from Skillet - In reference to what someone else said about skillet mixing heavy tracks and slow, mellow tunes, i think it's a good thing and gives them an edge, it adds variety to their music - i would buy the album alone for the depth and passion that goes into Johns Lyrics, His life is obviously directly proportional to his lyrics and those speak highly of him. A definate good buy - Skillet is an aquired taste, so if youre a fellow skillet addict, you should own this CD... :)"
2,a christian alternative,"I first got this cd a couple years ago, when I was turning away from secular musik. To be honest I was more impressed with earilier skillet releases that were more rock, less pop/""metal"". To this day I can't deny the inventiveness of some songs on hey you I love your soul. However, their stab at industrial metal is less than satisfactory. There are no guts, no edge.This album is though, a true christian alternative to Marilyn Manson. Just understand that along with the removal of the anti-establishment lyrics, the raw music is also taken.The music deserves three stars, but the lyrics and content take one. It is only a christian alternative, don't expect it to make you think about or force you to re-examine anything except your faith, if even that. I do understand that faith is enough to justify an album's content. However, I prefer music like Project 86 or Pink Floyd, that make me ponder society, politics and often music itself."
5,"Apart from the cover art, this CD is amazing! :)","Over the last few years Skillet has emeerged as the top techno-rock group on the Christian scene, and this latest release only speaks the best for them. From the opening seconds of the album to the inspiring finale, the message in Alien Youth stays true to the gospel of Jesus Christ, and the music stays true to their fans' expectations. I've listened to this CD all the way through at least 14 times now. And I've only had it for a couple days :) Recommend this to ALL your friends!!!Check out my other reviews for great Christian CDs, Books, movies, etc."
5,An Incredible Album,"I had never heard of Skillet before buying this album. I'm very glad that I read the review on Amazon before buying, because this is a Christian cd that's different from all the other Christian bands.The lyrics definitely proclaim the awesome majesty of Christ. Although I read a few gripes about having hard and soft music on one cd, I really like the mix this cd provides. I love worship songs, but also found that the lyrics to the harder songs were easy to hear and understand. The vocals are beautiful and the instruments are exceptional.I don't understand why this band has never been on one of the WOW compilation cd's. Skillet definitely has music that is better than many of the contemporary artists. I was impressed with this album and will buy their other albums. I love the fact this band proclaims the Message of Christ clearly, loudly, and sometimes with softer ballads."
4,"good cd, would definitely reccomend","This CD is awesome. I only gave it 4 stars because, as another reviewer said, they coulda left out ""come my way"" and ""will you be there."" but i have to definitely disagree with that same reviewer on another point. ""the thirst is taking over"" is the best song on the CD. as a hard rock fan, this is a bit out of place for me, but you need some slow songs every once and a while. and this isnt a typical ballad. its a skillet ballad. with techno to it, and even goes pretty hard towards the end."
5,A CD that will not be compromised...,"This CD is the epitome of the Christian life. There are times of feeling broken (""Eating me away"", ""Hill me, Heal me"", ""Will you be there?""); looking for hope (""You are my hope"", ""Come my way""); needing self-empowerment (""Alien youth"", ""Earth invasion"", ""Stronger""); wanting to worship (""The thirst is taking over"", ""One real thing"") and having moments of realization (""Vapor"", ""Rippin' me off""). Skillet is not a band for Christians looking to get there secular fix, rather it is for those who want there Christianity."
2,Not impressed,"I just received this organic bib and burp cloth in the mail today and I must say that I am not impressed. Upon opening up the bag, I noticed that it was not sealed shut but rather taped shut. Secondly, the product is made in China and I am very weary of their organic standards. The description states that the product is soft but I have to differ. I traced the cloth on my face and was not pleased. It felt scratchy and course. Lastly, I have NO IDEA what the embroidered picture is. I've been studying the picture and I have no clue.Hopefully the softness will appear after I wash it. Overall, the price is very good but I wish It wasn't made in China! I could have gone to Walmart or somewhere easier to return."
5,CLASSY ENDING FOR A CLASS ACT,"This was Rare Bird's swan song and what a classy way to end a beautiful but underappreciated career. Many fans felt that the band changed after the first two albums (originally on the ABC Probe label). I like to think of the three albums on the Polydor label as growth, without which a band grows stagnant covering the same old ground. The multi-layers of keyboard playing on this final album is nothing short of incredible. It shows especially on Last Tango In Beulah where they keep adding layers as the song builds to its climax. They were proof that pop rock does not have to be simplistic. It is truely a shame that more people are not familiar with their music."
5,What A Great Game!!!!!!,Max Payne was a great game for the major systems. The GBA version was an awsome Achievement for RockStar Games. I loved the game as much as the XBOX game. Same great story same great gun play. The Bullet Time was amazing for the GBA. Go out and buy MAX PAYNE for the GameBoy Advance.
5,A AWSOME GAME,Well I bought this game based on amazon users reviews. i was a little worried but I started and IT WAS AWSOME. The Graphics are great. OYEA and it has full voiceovers on the cutscens. Now the Bad. The only bad thing is the health. Unless you are using Slo-Mo (Bullet Time) You will usually lose about 1/6 of your health. Last the game is GORy WHICH IS AWSOME IF YOU ARE 12 or older but little ones should not play this gameOverall 9 out of 10
5,The greatest hand held game from GBA and DS,"I own a DS and find GBA games to be more suited towards what I like. Wolfenstein 3-D was my favorite game until Max Payne came along. The other Rockstar game, Grand Theft Auto was a total waste of time. This game is ultra violent but very fun. I love the slow mo gun play and its very easy to follow. It does seem hard at some points but gets easier once you play a few times. Highly recommend this game for fans who love first shooter games. One of the best handheld games i've ever played."
4,another good one.,Was a bit slow getting into the story but I liked it anyhow. Just love her work....Read and reread sometimes. Have quite a few on kindle now and want more.... Keep them coming...
3,"Not bad, but not worth a hardcover","I'm having a hard time with this book. It certainly isn't bad, but it's very easy to put down. I've read all the Angel and Buffy books, and this one falls somewhere in the middle. I thought the last book, Vengeance, was far superior to this one. Wish I had waited for the paperback, or download version. Too many flashbacks, too many bad guys. I read these books to read about Angel, and he's not around a lot in this one."
1,Buy it in the store,"The product was wrapped in a box that had an awful smell! The date was older than the same item bought in the supermarket. I was very disappointed. But when it is fresh, it is a great pick-me-up snack!"
2,Zinn Did It Better,"Here's how Loewen did it. He compiled a bunch of high school history text books, grabbed his well worn copy of Howard Zinn's ""A People's History of the United States"" and got to writing. As a high school teacher I'm not surprised that Loewen found his material for ""America's History Texts"" on the dusty shelves of the Smithsonian. Maybe he should have looked a little harder, like his local high school, than a realiance on what have to be outdated text books that support his thesis. I'm just hoping Loewen is paying royalties to Zinn, who did all this 15 YEARS PRIOR TO THIS BOOK, and did a much better job."
3,Areas of Concern,I teach US History and Economics on a Native American reservation and do understand some things that Loewen is trying to express. I am at loss at areas he should have talked about. Many Americans have a poor understanding of US History. I don't use the text much but use research methods on what interests students. I also start sometimes from the end of a text and work back. Students love this approach. For a sociologist talking about history gives a bias prospective. History is history. You can't lie about it but one can sure hope that something is remembered such as where New Mexico is located and not having to bring a passport to that state to visit one of our fifty states.Mark
2,Will confirm your biases,"This is a book designed to Preach To The Choir. As such, it does speak to some of the innacuracies in our collective history, but overlooks those innacuracies that don't fit his world veiw.One example: Loewen does a good job of countering some of the myths surrounding the early explorers (Columbus, deLeon), but fails to note that the natives on the continent were organized into about 500 nations, a huge number of which were genocidal warrior tribes (Blackfoot comes to mind).If you're on the Left, you'll give it 5 stars and claim it a masterpiece. If you're on the Right, one star for the PC crap.."
1,"Same Old, Same Old","While there are some interesting facts in this book; they are set adrift in a sea of drivel. Lowen's simplistic perception of historical events is just what I heard in my 11th grade U.S. History class [44 years ago]... plus a little editorializing about what a dreadful race Europeans are. Lots of ""Politically Correct"" stuff; some true, some not so true and some spun to fit the aurthor's paradigm.KIT COLLINS"
1,Non stop PC blabber,"I bought this book to give to my US History teacher, who wrote me a college recommendation. Before I gave it to him, I skimmed through tha pages and was appalled: Page after page of gruesome details and facts on how EUropean settlers and ""whitey"" in general oppressed the native Americans, blacks, and every living thing on the face of the Earth. I was under the impression that this was an educational book that would have a few smart quips about the wrongdoings of the settlers and white America throughout the history of the United States. I did NOT expect it to be some sort of politically correct drivel that is so popular with the far left these days."
1,The most dead-on correct view of over 300 reviews here is the african-not-necessarily-meaning-black one,"Loewen is purely guilty of taking everything about the continent of Africa and wrongly presuming it all 100% relates to black people.Maybe he didn't actually know the dna studies of people like Egyptians or Libyans shows them to be more akin to white middle-eastern folks than sub-saharan african ones but he more for sure knew of a fanatical Libyan leader named Khadafi! Was Khadafi anywhere near as black-skinned as, say, Sydney Poitier, Loewen? No the native born-Libyan wasn't in the slightest! In fact Libyan-born Khadafi was quite southern-European looking. So yes the book is certainly and deliberately somewhat garbagy just for the overplay by the author on the subject of africans-are-always-black-people. Thank you to the reviewer who pointed this out previously. You have by far the best take on the worst thing about this book and it's author."
1,"1 star. Not allowed less, as in a totaliatrian government","It is true our history books are a mess. It is also true that the professors who wrote them are a mess. Writing from their ivory tower where they benefit from the best education and style of living a free capitalisc society can provide, they diligenty spend their time in a fantasy land of mental utopias attempting to destroy all this country has provided for them. This book is socialist diatribe. While much may be true, the intent is an ugly expose of the professorial thinking college students are ""brainwashed"" with in most of today's universities. It's not that a lot of the basic information is wrong. It's that it has a socialist agenda, and young people, having no more experience in the real world than their spoiled brat professors, ""eat it up."" Kind of like a child molester preying on the innocent. Garbage! Not because it doesn't make honest clarifications in history, but because of it's political agenda"
2,The Typical Liberal View,"The substance of this book is all crap - the typical liberal view of history. Writers like this never see that they use the same argumemts that the orignal history books in school use. Their argument is just based on their non-objective views. One example: we all know ( from many school history books) that Columbus was not the first explorer to discover America ( the name of our continent should prove that - are continent is not named Columbus). Yet this author prefers to go into a long list of explorers ranting about not getting credit for it's discovery, and the only proof he offers are other books written by other book selling want to be's."
4,Amazing,"I'm a conservative (libertarian leaning) white male, and while I can certainly detect the author's slant, I'd have to say that it in no way detracts from the importance of this book. It's very well documented and I appreciated it greatly. I read it years ago when it first came out based on the interview that Brian Lamb did with the author (on C-SPAN Booknotes). I recently re-read it and I have to say that it seems less slanted to me now than it did then. I have no idea why that would be, but it's true."
5,A Great Critique of History Textbooks,"This book was one of the most interesting and surprising books I read. And most of the inaccuraces are true... many of the things he points out were confirmed by my AP history teacher and were incorrect or not mentioned in our textbook. I strongly recommend it to any students or anyone who is interested in history (or even those who aren't!)The book editorializes somewhat on some of the stuff, but the author encourages you to check out the stuff he says for himself and not to just trust him blindly. There is also a great list of ideas and resources for history teachers at the end of the book and footnotes for almost all the facts mentioned.Read this book!"
4,Critics Need to Give More Examples,"I'm willing to be persuaded that this author got it all wrong, but I need more examples from his critics besides just the one about North Africans not being ""black."" I was especially disappointed by the comment below from the History PhD, who said he'd found more than a hundred errors in the book. Mr. PhD didn't bother to list even three of those ""errors"". If you want to persuade me to your view, give me facts -- not feelings or academic credentials."
4,Want to learn history well? It'll take some initiative on your part.,"I read the first edition of this book around the time I graduated high school, and I was surprised, no shocked, by how much American history I didn't know. And that was just the stuff I thought I knew. Glossing over complex topics in a history textbook is one thing, but the real offense is when the facts presented are simply wrong. This happens far more often than you think.The author is spot-on about high school history courses being unforgivably boring. Teaching history well means teaching controversy, and that means upsetting a lot of people--a nearly impossible task to sustain in a publicly-funded institution."
3,"read the first half, forget the second half","the first half of the book is a riveting account of Columbus, Native Americans, and pre-1900 African Americans. Loewen combines his criticism of current history pedagogy with details that few Americans know about the above topics.Unfortunately, the second half of the book departs from that writing style. Loewen concentrates on topics such as approval of books by local school boards while very briefly discussing the controversial issues of 20th century American history."
4,Well worth reading,"It is very well written and informative. It does provide a history of this country one doesn't get elsewhere, particularly in school. In some ways it is a little too instructional to history teachers, although he does illustrate ways that teaching history could be more interesting and participative."
4,Masters program required read,"Generally interesting for the subject matter. Can be too abrasive at times, so read around the attack sections. Make sure to verify anything listed as ""fact"" by doing your own research."
3,I was a whiny baby when I first read this,"This isn't an amazing book, but its interesting enough to justify the read, and my recollection is that it went by -very- quick. The complaint here would be that its a ~political~ book and it is written from a left perspective. That's no longer really a justifiable complaint in a world where amazon reviews exist. You can't argue you were blindsided unless you just did zero research whatsoever."
5,exellent,Beside the great deal I got from the seller. The book is amazing and i recommend you reading it. More with the perfect price they sell it over amazon
5,College Sociology assignment,"This book is fabulously interesting. This book was given to my class as an assignment for Soc. 101 in 1998. It will open your eyes to the truth behind American history. If all History books were written with the real truth, as this book is, I would never have fallen asleep in my high school history classes!"
5,Lies My Teacher Told Me,"This book is a must read for anyone that is tired of reading history as written by the ""victor"" as most history is. Of course there's the victors side, however the vanquished side and the truth or an unbiased side are also angles of history which we would do well to know about. Here one gets an eyefull of what the ""others"" side of the story is. With the victor writing everyting it's all so biased, how can anyone make an intelligent decision on what happened or what and how to improve culture and government if we're not even fully aware of what really went on? Even though this book has been around for quite a while it seems to be a lot more up date then all the existing history books that are so concerned with making things look good, whitewashing things ad infinitum."
2,Revisionist History,"This book while it has some redeming value, is also a platform for the authors views, and interpretations of events.The book is full of unsubstantiated facts, and statements reported as history. History should be like the news is supposed to be, just the facts.Read the book but keep in mind that just because it's in a book doesn't make it true. And continue to read and talk about these subjects. And most importantly remember the events covered in this book are taken out of historical content. And you can't be sure what you would have done in these times, in these situations."
2,A mixed bag,"This book certainly has some important points, and much of it is interesting and informative. The central premise that our textbooks are biased to color history is well supported. However, as one can surmise from the less glowing reviews, the author rants way too much, and much of the book is repeating the same point over and over. By the end of the book, I was quite ill from the hurling of pieties from the mountain."
4,"Yes!, it's a polemic, not history, but a good one","This book is not a history textbook and I do not think that was the author's intention. The book, or pamphlet if you like, is an argument meant to clue everyone in of the clear bias in U.S. history textbooks that teach high school students tripe (in the words of Lisa Simpson). The examples are few but well argued and it is slanted to the left and deals a lot with race and class relations. It is meant for the layman and does a good job arguing part of what is wrong with U.S. History textbooks. You will find theories on why the textbooks all seem to say the same, un-thought-provoking things, included in many of the examples."
2,The author forgot what his own title was.,"This book starts off on the right track. It corrects or fills in parts of early American history; Colubus, Revolutionary war, Civil war ect. BUT then it takes turn to push the authors own political agenda. The author believes that high school history should be used to push students toward his views. It is full of the usual jabs at the Reagan/Bush admin. with little supporting material to back up the claims. This author should have stuck to the title. Or the book should be retitled ""Lies I Would Tell You if I Were Your Teacher"""
2,Smart people don't need this book,"The most shocking thing I came away with after reading this book is that it the author thought he was telling us something we don't know. The most shocking thing I came away with after reading the rest of these reviews is that people in this country aren't as smart as I would have hoped. This book is like an email that is funny at first...but after the 100th time you've received it its annoying. Retreads of factoids...I'm surprised he didn't devote a few chapters to ""George Washington never chopped down a cherry tree."" There are some passages that are simply the authors soapbox....throwing in facts and stats that are obviously part of an angenda, because they are not refuting anything specifically cited from a book. If I wrote a college paper like this, I would get a D at best... The more you like this book, the less thinking you've done for yourself."
5,People read it!,"I am Russian. In my short lifetime (i'm 28 only) they have re-written Russian/Soviet history textbooks already two times, changing black to white arbitrarily, whatever suited the government better.No nation wants to look bad. But producing fairy tales and lying to yourself is not a way out. And after acknowledging all sides of your heritage you are not going to be any worser. Quite the opposite, i think."
2,The Three Stars Have It,"While this book does bring up some valid points there is absolutely no doubt that the author's extreme left-wing bias gets in the way. However Loewen does footnote all his assertions so his sources can be checked in the back. I found this very useful in discerning the truth from the propaganda. Read the five and one star reviews with a grain of salt, anyone who said this book was dead on is way to set in there liberal ways. On the other hand those who say the book didn't even raise one valid point are leaning hard in the other direction. Definitely get this one at the library or borrow it from a friend."
3,"Eh, So-So.","The book had some interesting material, but the author seemed to blame white men for anything and everything that's ever happened on the face of the earth. Every demographic has had its problems at some point or another, but you wouldn't know it by reading this book. Loewen gave a very unbalanced history, just like the textbooks he spent 300 pages criticizing for the same."
2,A great idea ruined by ideology.,"If you are looking for an enjoyable read exposing commonly held historical inaccuracies as I was, you should probably skip this title. There are a number of interesting facts in this book, however to get through to them you have to page through line after line of the author's apparent ideological crusade and ramblings against the institutions. A few valid points are brought up but most are taken to the extreme: Do we really care if history books neglect to mention Helen Keller was a communist?Overall the overtone of the book was heavily biased, perhaps even more so than the history books the author was criticizing. I would have preferred to learned of the events discussed in the book from an objective point of view without the author sticking in his cynicism after every sentence."
4,A must read for the educated person.,"This ought to be required reading prior to high school graduation... It's amazing how much the average person has been misinformed. It is simply sad that school text books continue to be reprinted, without having updated or corrected any of the catastrophic amounts of bogus, and down right fallacious, information they contain."
4,Eye opening,"Although I knew intutively that history's facts( ? ) depend on who is writing it, I was educated to some interesting and new revelations."
1,History revised for a specific agenda.,"This book does exactly what it complains about. The focus is on the author's personal agenda and, once again, history is distorted to support a personal opinion rather than presenting well documented facts. People reading this are advised to seek out original sources from the particular period and come to a more informed viewpoint rather than letting others distort America's interesting and colorful past."
1,Politically-correct lock-step nonsense,"This hyper-politically-correct tome will win the affection of academia, with their hatred of power (real or perceived) and hostility toward the very idea of dispassionate truth. It's not that the author makes no good points -- indeed, many of his points are extremely well-taken -- it's that his agenda is so open, his axe-grinding so blatant, that unless you've already researched the histories in-depth, you just don't know which parts of his analysis to trust and which to discard as leftist hyperbole and fiction. In fact, the best thing I can say about this book is that the author made little attempt to hide his very pronounced sociopolitical biases.My advice: Ignore the book. There are many books examining the mind-boggling distortions of ""history"" -- distortions as gladly perpetrated by the political left as the right -- which still manage to avoid the strident anti-establishment tone and vomitous academic pandering that Loewen glories in."
2,Good Facts But Too Much Politics,"I bought this book looking for some facts about our history books. I found about 100 pages of facts in a 400 page book. The rest was all politics and complaining. If you are a Socialist or die hard Democrat, you will love this book. It complains about Republicans and Europeans ancestors and blames them for all that is evil in the American system. Although Democrats lookout, he also complains about President Kennedy. Yes, our four fathers made a lot of mistakes, and yes, a lot could be added into text books. But, it took him 400 pages to write about all he wanted to complain about. Do we really want to add another 400 pages to our text books for our youth to have to read? I am a History guy, and there are some great facts that make you think. If you could just get rid of all the politics and personal views, it would be a much smaller and more interesting book."
1,Liberal View Point,This gentleman has white guilt. This is what is causing the deterioration of the country. It's just another liberal slant on how horrible white people are and how America is the worst country on the planet.
3,Interesting but a little too political,"I thought that there was a lot of interesting points made in this book, but I feel the author is very political in making his points."
5,An eye opener,"Very good read, bares the truth to our history, a very disapointing history, I recommend anyone who wants the real truth about our history to please read this book. Its an eye opener..."
3,"Good, but filled with an almost Marxist ideology","This book is informative, well written and well researched. It is a refreshing perspective on American history. However, the Lowen seems to be trying very hard to imbue us with his left-wing views. Much of his analysis and many of his conclusions are a major stretch from the facts, to the point where his interpretations are quite annoying."
1,"Bring a bag, you may get sick to your stomach","James Loewen's book, while advertising to give us the straight scoop on history that a dozen years or more of public education could not, is little more than a bad attempt at trying to combine his radical leftist viewpoint with some history anecdotes he feels are left out or not discussed enough and calling it the real history of this country. Although there are some interesting points he does make, for the most part he goes on and on about how bad anyone who has managed to do something with their life should feel (that person could only be a white male according to Loewen) and that history books are only here to make those same people feel not so bad about their position in life. It is a terribly slanted book, and I would strongly suggest that unless you are forced to read it by your liberal history professor (as I was), let this one stay on the shelf."
1,Making a point and then running with it.,"This book, while making some valid points, chooses to revise history in a way that is truly unforgivable, often going too far. Be careful what you believe. Some of the, uh-hum, facts (clear throat) are incorrect."
3,Lies My Teacher Told Me,"While I agree that the content history textbooks is manipulated to show only a snipet and one sided point of view, it is the teacher's responsibility to provide a more indebt view into history. To suggest that all teachers of history simply take what's printed in books as authentic and true is blaming teachers for all of the untold truths in History. Please."
1,"Run, Don't look back!","I bought this book in search of the truth in history, but I only found it to be a book written by an obvious liberal with his own agenda. Instead of clarifying issues, they were muddied and distorted. It fascinates me how historians can take one aspect of a person or an event and label it or them as a bigot or a racist. UGGHHH!"
1,The Left Wing March Continues to Balkanize our Country,"Complete and utter tripe, typical pandering to the kumbyah, we are the world crowd, no wonder we have morons occupying Wall Street et al, maybe they should occupy our bloated universities... 1 trillion dollars and rising of education debt, for what, useless degree's and corrupt knowledge from idiot authors like this, I wonder if he has ever held a real job, Yep more power to the Black Panthers, La Raza and whatever other whining group that has a sense of entitlement...You lefties are so gulible, he's getting rich on your loans, this disgusting perversion of America's history, yep you are helping him to join the 1 percenters while you are up to you eyes in debt with a useless pieces of paper which can't even get you a job in Mc Donalds, sad, passed over for an illegal alien...Morons like this are the reason why our country is breaking apart, why our kids get dumber, why business moves it factories and production oversea's,Disgusted..."
1,Progressive drivel,"This is a revisionist history rant by a left wing sociologist. Loewn, and Zinn, who praises the book, are well known dissenters. They believe any and all dissent is good, regardless of whether it is true to the facts or not. And facts may be fabricated, sources misrepresented, to support their 'progressive' self-loathing drivel."
1,Liberal rhetoric,"Liberal rhetoric. Left-wing propaganda. Annoying, and telling, that the agenda was that obvious less than half way through the book."
1,Just another political opinion disguised as history.,"A person buys the book with the hope of having more light, more research, more investigation shed on history, only to quickly discover that it is no more than another political agenda being espoused. Much like Woods, only opposite, it is just a pick and choose version of history to make some groups and people look like the villians. The scary thing is Woods and Loewen are both supposed to be history professors. They should be banned from educating chickens if they cannot keep their bias' in check. It is depressing that we cannot manage to get the benefit from history as long as authors like Loewen hide behind a false title to promote their own views.There are as many Falsities in the Lies My Teacher Told Me as any kid would get in school. They are not lies, any more than the ones he claims to correct; it is just the same selective research to support his own personal values. It has nothing to do with good historic research or understanding."
5,A Matter of Perception,"So you thought you knew your history?In this book, James Loewen performs a masterful job of challenging how we perceive historical events and how they are taught to us. In the process, he draws our awareness to the cultural and therefore political wrongs of our past and prompts us to consider our future in a new light. Columbus, the Pilgrims, Wilson, and other historical key figures will not be considered the same after reading this book.It's a shame more authors don't pursue similar establishment challenging book content"
4,very good,This book is a text book for a class. That being said I would recommend all American people to read it.
4,Mike Martocci,I found Lies my Teacher Told Me to be a interesting book. There were many interesting facts about the truth behind many parts of history that I had no idea about prior to reading his book. Most of the chapters kept me interested except for a few. Some chapters started to lose my attention because I felt that many of the chapters were too similar to previous chapters. They talked about different things in history but it was just talking about one piece of history after another for just about all the chapters of the book. Overall i believe it was a good book and I would recommend reading it.
3,not bad,"Good book. Slight hypocrisy when the author while railing against the error of making our founding fathers and Columbus look perfect, he makes this same error with the Native Americans."
2,"Interesting, thought-provoking but very tedious to finish","Although points were made in this book that were eye-opening it was a hard book to finish. James Loewen is clearly not a history professor, he is a professor of sociology. So the book is basically about race & class relations and how they are misrepresented in American History books. This is interesting & made me change my vocabulary to some degree. However he drones on about 2-3 points in the whole book, so it begins to get tiring. Also, I was expecting a more broad discussion of 'Lies my Teachers Told Me' rather than just one on Race relations. I did find the book interesting, I'm glad I read it. I would recommend it to someone who wants to know more about race & class (sociology) rather than history."
4,A must read for everyone in america,"While high school history textbooks aren't a major authority on history, they are the only history most of the US citizens will receive and at least partially remember. What they will come to learn slowly, too slowly, over time is that most of the attitude taken in these books is dangerously biased and sometimes all out wrong.It can be dry in some parts but just fast forward if you think your done with the topic. You may miss some interesting things though so just try and sit through all of it.Recommended before teaching any history course."
4,www.sportofdistraction.com,"Excellent alternative view of history. The authors conclusions may or may not be on point, but the information is ideal for those hungry for additional sources of history, but not more of the same that you receive from sources rooted in the establishment.As with all things, we must check the sources...if the sources pan out, then the only valid objection will be with the analysis, if there are any objections at all."
1,The Pot Calls the Kettle Black,"This books disspells a few minor assumptions and manages to assassinate some American legends along the way, but the real source of the lies and propaganda we've been force-fed all of our lives is much more contemporary."
1,Too Over The Top,"His arguments are Neo-Marxist at best. That in itselef does not scuttle this book, but his heavy handed approach does. Thus, even the valid points in this book get lost among the overbearing agenda.In fact, Loewen's approach in this book mirrors his own argument for what's wrong in schools. Loewen knows 'The Truth' and to hell with anyone who sees history differently. In the end, Loewen reminds me of many of my burned out Baby Boomer college professors who are stuck in 60s and ready to berate us with ""The Truth"".This is one book worth skipping.."
1,what a book,"This book does a good job putting down alot of the things many children learn today when they are young. The book is full of the author's opinion on history and on the country, so unless you'd enjoy a biased read this book isn't too good. I had to read the book for a first year course at my college, but if it were not a required reading I would never have read the book, let alone made it past the first chapter.- JM"
1,Overrates the importance of textbooks,"Don't waste your time on this book. It has little new information, especially for history teachers. It is pretty much a standard revisionist rehash. It vastly overrates the importance of using textbooks in the classroom. Most modern history teachers are not married to the textbook anymore. The author assumes that teachers are stuck in an outmoded method of instruction where teachers just teach out of the textbook every day. It ignores innovative teachers that use primary source readings, simulations, films, debates, projects, class discussions, etc. When was the last time the author actually stuck his head in a classroom to see what is going on today?"
3,Trash America,"THIS BOOK IS A RANT. IF YOU WANT TO MAKE WHITE PEOPLE AND CHRISTIANS VILLAINS THIS IS THE BOOK FOR YOU. Even the Pilgrims were guilty of lying about where they had planned to settle. Such a conspiracy. I do agree that history text books are dry, dead bones and heavy."
2,Serious left-wing bias with religious ardor,"Okay, the author presents another side of our American heroes. These heroes had their flaws, some of them more generous than others. To the extent we come to know these flaws, it is good.Obviously, the author ideology is left wing to extreme left wing. Why can't he then criticize fellow Marxists whose philosophy he probably shares - Stalin, Mao and PolPot? In a matter of few years, these left-wing atheists murdered tens of millions of their own citizens. Stalin alone killed 6,000 innocent Polish officers, not to mention the millions that died during forced deportations and collectization - all the while promoting the modern rice religion - Marxism.So American heroes are somewhat tainted, Communist heroes are even more so. Will Mr. Loewen present the evils of Marxism as experienced by the Russians, Chinese and Cambodians?A moderate Independent voter...."
1,Lowen is a nut,"Take what he says with a grain of salt. Lowen is a believer of ""historical justice."" He thinks that it is wrong to teach what actually happens in history and thinks that we should teach ""possiblities"" so that everyone is included and history isn't so ""eurocentric."" Basicly anything he says is probably a lie and or laced with white guilt and writen to influnce readers in a political way, not to express history. Don't be fooled."
2,"Interesting, thought provoking, but wrong","I do believe that the author has done his research. I beleive he makes many valid points in this book. And while I agree that our history should not be taught without truth, or boredom, I cannot agree that we should put a corrupt, mean, bullying, lieing, spin on it. It is obvious that he holds a extreme fanatical liberal view of the country and our history at times and as one who believes that for all it faults, this nation tries to repeatedly do 'the right thing', Mr. Loewen does not. Interesting book, but when I wasn't saying huh, from learning something new....I was sitting in boiled blood from all the anti-patriotic u.s. bashing."
1,dictators rewrite history books,My title sums it up. Read the other reviews to further support this point.
1,"a terrible book, do not read","this book is crammed with liberal revisionist history, that is quite laughable. The only lies being exposed by this book are the ones written by the author. Bunch of leftist crap, that twists history to support a society based off of entitlements and welfare. Do yourself a favor and do not read."
1,Lies My Teacher Told Me : Everything Your American History T,"Disjointed, poorly organized and disappointing"
2,Good start-did not finish,"As a liberal who does not appreciate the rewritting of history, I found the book's premise to have merit and it began well. But on page 50 Loewen lost me. He quotes from the work of Ivan Van Sertima, one of best known Afrocentric wishful thinkers. Except for a little skimming, I was finshed with Lies My Teacher Told Me."
5,"Very, very impressive!","This book is fantasic. It is full of insightful passages that present the information in a concise, thorough manner. Just read some of the other reviews posted, and you'll see that Mr. Loewen has done an exellent job of debunking myths, and exposing hidden truths of history. Your going to need to read this book more than once to fully absord the wealth of information that is provided. I'm on my third reading, and I'm enjoying it as much as my first! Be sure to keep a good highlighter pen with you when you read this book..."
2,"Good beginning, then hypocrisy","If there was ever a book that need to lose half of its content, here is the book.He does a good job in the early chapters detailing how classroom teachings about Indians and Wilson are inept. However, when it comes to the Civil War, he becomes quite hypocritical. He himself leaves out important facts about the Civil War; instead giving us an ignorant view of the South. How are we to trust what he says if he himself omits details? He makes outrageous statements about American soldiers in Vietnam taking body parts from Viet Cong, and then does not give us a suitable reference to this grisly detail.Avoid this book."
3,Interesting reading,"I am not sure that everything in this book is true, but it is interesting reading. I think on some items the teacher was telling the truth and the author had an opposing view."
4,Wonderful,This was a wonderful book to read. I want to go and research some of the items discussed in the book but it was very shocking to read about all the mistakes and misleading information in our textbooks. I plan to volunteer for our local textbook selection board or at least plan to make sure that I have some input to what my children learn in school.
4,More objectivity and less exclamation points,"There's no denying that this book has had a profound impact on me. So much so that I really wonder how the 8th grade social studies unit on Georgia was taught to my middle schooler in a Georgia school. Were the negatives about Georgia's past even mentioned? However, the author makes too many points using exclamation points. I'm not merely quibbling about punctuation but it begins to be the equivalent of writing something on the internet in ALL CAPS. You feel like you're being shouted at. In spite of that, the best thing this book can do for a reader is to drive them to reading his reference materials and other books about history to attempt to get a more complete understanding, not only of history, but of the ideology that informs policies."
1,Useless waste of precious time,"I asked for and recieved this book and the author's other dreck about wrong history in the U.S. (roadsigns) for Christmas, 2007.The author is wrong. The author is biased. The author doesn't care about facts; he has a message to promote.I regret asking my relatives to spend their hard-earned money on this poorly-researched propaganda and I regret wasting what precious time I have reading it.Can I speak any more forcefully about how rotten and disgusting this author's alternate history ""history"" really is? This is the sort of drivel that should get one's tenure revoked and should cause employers to fire Mr. Loewen for outright academic dishonesty."
1,Too simplistic and PC,I read this book and was very disappointed. It is not a book foranyone who has studied history.It is as simplistic and bias as a jr high history class.My advice---give it a miss. I sold my copy on Ebay.
4,"Excellent, with a bend","After reading this book I found out why I always had such a black hole concerning Native American studies. In short, ""settlers"" (the land was already settled by natives) pillaged, raped, killed, and generally stole the land. This does not make a ""feel good"" history for America and thus does not make it into textbooks. This is one of many stark examples Loewen presents of the sad quality of textbooks. He properly cites his sources and leaves the evidence to speak for itself. However . . .Social science and a left lean guide him. Social scientists and historians exhibit sibling rivalry at times, but I take his critiques constructively. He leans left in the final chapters which isn't bad, but I've heard it before. The right side of the spectrum could listen and take it constructively too.All told a good book. Though it did make me want to crawl under a rock and say ""I give up!"" I will find his lessons useful when I teach my own high school History classes.Sincerely,Z"
2,Lies My Teacher Told Me,Lies My Teacher Told me has interesting facts about history that many people did not learn in school. I found that most of the book was boring and seemed to repeat itself. The book tends to dwell on all of the bad things that have happened in the past and none of the good. I would not recommend this book to anyone.
4,Not a bad place to start,"The subtitle is a little ambitious. How about ""A Few of the Things Your American History Textbook Got Wrong""?Nonetheless, if it gets you pointed in the right direction, that's good."
4,Lies My Teacher Told Me: Everything Your American History Textbook Got Wrong,I loved reading this book. It caused me to stop and think about some of the things I learned in High School.
4,Apolitical and Worth the Read,"If you're concerned that this is going to be a simple-headed bashing of European white males, it isn't. While the book does concern itself with the Eurocentric approach to U.S. history, it's so much more. The author read and dissected 12 major U.S. history books. His position--that a combination of loony textbook review committees, greedy publishers, uninvolved authors, and moronic politicians have left high school history textbooks a wasteland of patriotic, uninspired babble--is well supported in his work.It's a great read and I highly recommend it."
3,Same old same old,"This book re-hashes all the same ""progressive"" complaints about our history text-books. Mostly, that the text-books do not tell the ""truth"" about American history. The biggest complaint is that history books are euro-centric, and do not expose the dark side of American history. Yes, I agree; but history is full of conquering, slavery and all the other mis-deeds of the human race and is generally written by the group that came out on top. But that is what the history teacher is for - to fill in the knowledge gaps."
5,Truth beyond the whitewash,"Loewen's book is a well documented and eye-opening discourse on the travesty that is high school history education in the US. In a very readable style he lays out the over-simplification, sanitization, and ""sins of omissions"" that textbook authors, their publishers, and misguided civic leaders have perpetuated within American education system. It is both an engrossing and, at the same time, infuriating book to read. This book should be on every US History teacher's bookshelf and required reading in every collegiate program for history education."
3,Interesting book,What a way to think about things. It is definetly worth reading just to get a new perspective on the history you have been taught all your life.
5,Awesome History Book-- With Citations!,"I love history books with actual citations! This book has a ton of citations from a lot of primary sources too. A lot of people are saying that the book is biased and that Loewen is ""ranting,"" but they aren't giving examples. Personally, I don't know what they're talking about. If people have researched the book and found that the facts he's giving are untrue, that is another thing. But a lot of the stuff I read were things I'd already heard before other places.This book seriously changed my life at a time when I was starting to get a little depressed. It really brings things into focus. I have been telling friends and family members little factoids ever since!"
5,"Everyone should own this book, or e-book. Excellent read!",I read the original edition of this book and I'm just getting into the new material that was added to this one. Excellent book and I recommend EVERYONE reading this. It does leave a bit of anger in your mind on how bad we were taught American history in school. But it's never too late to set yourself straight and this book does an excellent job of that.
4,Important knowledge,"I am no student of US history, nor even American (I am British), and I have no first-hand knowledge of US high-school history textbooks, but if this is substantially true, then there are segments of US society that are behaving like revisionist soviet apparatchiks. All nations have made mistakes in their past. The best thing is to admit them, face up to them, learn from them and get over them. I only did not give the book five stars, because I thought that - while critical of the prolixity of most of the textbooks (among all the other shortcomings) - it was pretty long-winded itself! I thought Joshua Hughes's review (much more thorough than this one) was very fair."
3,Lies My Teacher Told Me Review,"If you love, or even mildly enjoy history, you should read Lies My Teacher Told Me by James Loewen. Loewen presents controversial issues about the history of the United States. He argues that some stories and facts, such as how the first Thanksgiving happened, were either flat out lies or p-art of the story was omitted. Although some people may seem offended at the notion that all they have learned is false, Loewen does present interesting claims and facts. Whether or not you agree with his suggestions about the History of the Unites states, he does present interesting arguments. He also suggests that if history classes were taught in a more controversial way (meaning adding the controversial subjects to lessons) then students would be more likely to enjoy their history classes.If you enjoy history and what to know more about it I would definitely read this book."
3,"INTERESTING, BUT BEWARE OF LOEWENS BIAS","Loewen writes an interesting book that needs to be read with caution. He brings up many interesting points that merit scrutiny. The treatment of US history often is told from a white, male, Eurocentric point of view, but Loewen often criticizes this with his P.C. rubric. Loewen is not even a historian, he is a political scientist that often presents incorect information, especially in the chapters about European history. As an example of his bias, Loewen criticizes history books for misrepresenting or omiting information about white American leaders, but in the same book criticizes history books for bringing up the fact that Martin Luther King Junior forged parts of his doctoral thesis. How can you criticize both? Overall I would recommend this book to anybody, but also warn them of Loewens bias."
5,"""PC blabber""?","Excuse me. What did the person who so passionately gave 1 star expect? Did you expect it to be another book glorifying everything whites did to found this country? James W. Loewen wrote this to include everything high-schoolers' textbooks ommitted about the leaders of America. The facts Loewen includes are not purposefully biased against Columbus and Woodrow Wilson, they are simply the truth. If you had actually read the book instead of skimming through it, you would realize that he gives both sides of the argument. This book is a complete and wholesome account of the history we don't know, and definitely not just some ""PC blabber""."
3,Good Idea,"I like the idea of this book. American history suffers from a heroification syndrome. In my high school class, we got taught that it was manifest destiny that we went into the west, and when natives got killed, well that was ok. But when settlers, got killed, that was a massacre.One of my majors at American University is History and these professors do a good job in telling both sides of the story."
2,Axe to grind....right down to the handle.,"I must begin by saying that the author has some very valid points to make...actually, about 4 or 5. The points are then belaboured and repeated to the point where you think: ""Didn't he already say this three times already?"". This book came out during the very popular, ""everything is so dammed Eurocentric"" sentiment bandwagon of the 90s. The question is whether you wish to teach kids to be so incredibly cynical as a learning foundation. It's a bit like reading a book on the world by Abbie Hoffman. There's truth in there somewhere but you have to filter out the ranting--and there's a lot of that! To be honest, the truth is probably somewhere in between."
4,Lies My Teacher Told Me,"James Lowen has exposed several problems I had with American History coarses in high school and college. I would love to have had the information this book brought to my attention when my college professor was assigning fictionalized autobiographies. (Lies my teacher assigned) I was, however, amazed to discover his liberal bias. I think it is amazing how someone could want to expose so much government sanctioned evil, and still be a proponent of the very same institution. All the same, I appreciate his honesty."
5,Great book on historical perspective,"My god some of these reviews are dumb... JUST BECAUSE SOMEBODY SEEKS THE TRUTH, IT DOESN'T MAKE THEM A LIBERAL!Not that there's anything wrong with being a liberal, but this isn't about liberal or right-wing- it's about portraying history truthfully. It's a good book, and it makes you think twice about heroification and glorification of historical figures. Definitely worth it."
3,Good information but beats the horse to death,"The book had some really interesting information about events that are typically glossed over or are severely slanted in typical textbooks. What I disliked about the book was having to weed through the author's constant references to, and picking on, certain textbooks. The book was a study of the textbooks so a certain amount of disection was required. However, the book would have beem a much more enjoyable read if the stories had been told without the constant bashing of textbook writers, publishers, and popular culture."
4,This book will get you thinking,"Yes, the author's politics and ideology come through more than it should for a history book but that said it was a very good book. It left me thinking and allowed some connecting of dots from past knowledge and reflections. In this day when it seems everything comes down to politics (as Will Rogers said -- ""it does not matter if you vote D or R, the government still gets in"" - OK, my politics is disdain for both parties) this book should be welcomed as a get away from the ""talking points"" of both sides as well as those that control the adaption of textbooks (they do wield considerable power). I guess I will have to read his new book on how he would approach a HS curriculum and wish he had been more specific in this book. It is one thing to complain, it is another to have a solution. His writing style makes his story line easy to follow."
4,We should re-examine how History is taught,"I believe that quite a few of the reviewers below are missing the point. While admittedly, the author is politically liberal, he is not attempting to promote his own political views. Instead, he is suggesting that if American History courses provided a complete picture of events and their impact upon future events, instead of the shallow one-sided white-American cheerleading that currently takes place, that perhaps students would be better prepared to take a position (be it liberal, conservative, or other) upon where this country stands and where it should be heading. While the author gets a bit repetitive, I was thrilled to re-learn what I was taught in High School, and I was fascinated to see how the dry list of events I memorized actually tied together. The author succeeds in getting the reader to seriously consider how our children should be educated in the future."
2,Disappointing,Thjis book promises far more than it delivers. It starts off with ensightful input abot the myths that make up our elief system in America. Then it settles on racial discrimination and does not move on. There are far more to the factors in the myths that America created and lives by than racial discrimination.
3,Not very factful,"Some things in this book are true. But after speaking with a few time travelers (yes, we are being visited by people from the future, I recommend listening to Art Bell on talk radio. It is surprising that so little of the truth is in our current history books. For example, who knew that Paul Revere was a phony?, the british weren't coming, they were already here, everyone in America was British prior to the end of the revolution. One time traveler even told me that the U.S. secretly helped Hitler establish extermination camps in order to reduce the worlds population that is still exploding. The bottom line is don't beleive the history books. The world is constantly changing and todays history might well be tomorrows lies..."
1,PC Leftist Bull for ex-hippie history teachers,"This is just more dead-white male bashing from PC Thugs. At times, Loewen makes sense, but most of the time its just boring, reactionary ranting and sucking up to ex hippies. My own history teacher worships the book like its the bible, and this is totally nonsense because the majority of the books is completely opinated, leftist oriented, and filled with plenty of Loewen's own lies and made up facts. I'm sick of people blinded by the left (or right) in their pursuit of history."
2,Pedantic and Boring Book,The only reason I gave 2 stars was because of the author's research. I plodded through this book which was more like a textbook. The author kept making comparisons with other history books time and time again. Then he brought up 3 African words to be used which made this even MORE boring and difficult to read.I read all of it except for the last chapter. I couldn't take anymore.I purchased this book because of the title and after a few pages I realized buying it was a mistake.The author repeated himself which made this book uninteresting.
5,"Excellent book, a real eye opener. Everyone should read this book!",Everyone in America should read this book. We all need to wake up and realize whats actually going on in our country. Don't be brain washed by textbooks!!
2,Too Much Kool-Aid,"Although he makes a few decent points in the course of the book, the author clearly imbibed entirely too much multi-cultural, anti-America kool-aid. He has also spent too much time in a college setting to functionally grasp the realities of how high schools work and the battles teachers, administrators and parents fight on multiple fronts just to keep them running on a daily basis in many parts of the country.Everyone knows there's plenty of room for improvement in high school history courses, but I don't see the answers coming from here. If you read this, do so for the interesting historical content the author discusses (or the entertainment value of his overly liberal perspective) and be prepared to take everything with more than a few grains of salt."
1,deleted it,"I am a total history buff. Anything on the subject fascinates me. But... I bought it; read it; deleted it and moved on with my life.We know that the textbooks are inadequate. That history is propaganda and alienating to people of color. We know that history class was 2nd right after math for skipping in school.I anticipated so much more than what I got. I felt deceived by the cover's promise to lay bare ""Everything Your American History Textbook Got Wrong"". Even just a tiny bit more would have kept it on my kindle."
2,Points blame at the wrong people,"The book itself does not shed any light on things that most who have studied history already know. Yet it now puts the blame on teachers who are the ones trying to correct the wrongs of past teachings. Prior to 1980, a coach was hired and then stuck in history in order to ""teach"" history because ""anyone can do that."" Not so anymore. Schools are now hiring teachers who actually know history and do not have to rely on a horridly written, inaccurate, and boring textbook. Lies my teacher told me is a misnomer and shifts the blame from parents and school administrators who don't know any better. These are the people who would rather see their children win a sporting competition than see them graduate. It should be called ""I should have listened to my teacher, Lies my textbook told me."" Poor product with not much new information for anyone who is acquainted with history."
2,look elsewhere,"This book substitutes a liberal bias for the conservative one. Besides, some of it is just plain wrong. To give just one example, the following quote from track 8Q:""In sum, affluent Americans, like their textbooks, are willing to credit racial discrimination as the cause of poverty among Blacks and Indians, and sex discrimination as the cause of women's inequality, but don't see class discrimination as the cause of poverty in general.""Its funny that Loewen, who loves to criticize conservatives (often a worthy cause in my opinion) is wrong in a way that gives up such an opportunity. He attributes to them, two ""liberal"" opinions that many of them would vehemently disagree with."
4,excellent!,"bill callahan aka smog once again out did himself. i think rain on lens is amazing; it is stronger lyrically and musically than dongs of sevotion which was no slouch by any means. rain on lens is much smoother, i immediately got into it. the only drawback is that it is too short. give it a try and listen, i promise you will not be disappointed."
5,Most affordable quality pet food Ive found.,My cats love love love this brand. They were sticking their heads in the bag when I first opened it. So cute! I cant find another brand of cat food with the ingredients I want in this large of a bag for the price.
5,great and healthy for cats,"i have been using blue cat food for 2 years and have been very happy with it. my cat is 18 years old and seems to be healthy and content. i received the food within 2 days, great service."
2,a month to get my order? really?......,Yes its a little cheaper online but you better be prepared to wait. For some odd reason they say it takes 2 weeks for them to be able to ship it out. I forgot and didnt order early enough and just had to order a bag on 5/11 and its 5/27 and still no cat food. Says it will be here June 2. Thats nuts. Not sure I will order online anymore. Its worth an extra $5 to just buy from petco.
3,"Good intro, but not enough to change your life","This is a good introduction to Buddhism. It gently explains how suffering is rooted in ignorance (""not seeing"" as Hagen likes to say). But the author doesn't stress enough that practicing daily meditation is necessary to produce a real change. Without daily practice, the ideas in this book remain merely that -- ideas."
3,Not as plain and simple,"The book was plain and simple in the beginning however it gradually got more complicated. I had to really think hard to try to understand the author's message as I read more into the book. I had read ""Mindfulness in Plain English: Revised and Expanded Edition"" by Bhante Henepola Gunaratana, and felt this book is much more plain, simple, and down to earth."
4,insightful...but where's the rest of Buddhism?,"This is a wonderful book, and Hagen deserves praise for stripping down the dharma to its essentials. The book is deep and clear. The only problem is that it strips down Buddhism so starkly, that most Buddhists from Buddhist countries would not recognize their own religion. My friends from Japan practice a more complicated and irrational kind of Buddhism --but somehow it's warmer and more friendly than Hagen's Zen version. Don't get me wrong, I would recommend this book to people. I just think this version of Buddhism is quite austere."
2,Nothing simple about it,"This book is definately not gears towards people new to Buddhism. The title is also somewhat misleading as it comes from a Zen Buddhism point of view, and not a general Buddhism point of view. because of this people may end up confused or making generalization about Buddhism as a whole. A better book is 'A Buddhism Primer - An Introduction to Buddhism', if you want a general overview of Buddhism this is the book for you."
3,Kindle Edition poorly edited,"I purchased this book for my kindle and was very excited to read most of the book, but as i was reading, the placement and paragraphs were poorly put together.The final Chapters were so bad i could not understand the content.I will probably buy the paper edition so i can read the rest. I have more than a dozen books on my kindle and this left me with questions regarding the content of future purchases for my kindle. Would suggest everyone read reviews before getting a book on kindle so you are not blind sided like i was."
4,"Plain, Simple, Good Read and &#65533;seeing&#65533; is believing.","In every Amazon search I did on Introduction To Buddhism books - Buddhism Plain and Simple popped up. In some reviews of other books on intro to Buddhism this one gets mentioned - so I had to give it a read.I very much enjoyed Steve Hagen's style of explaining concepts. Particularly he gives us a chance to experience true ""seeing"" in his chapter ""A Wheel Out of Kilter"". I wont give it away here, but it's a terrific and original tool and it truly helped me to ""see"" more clearly.If you're looking for a little more than just an introduction to Buddhism give this a read. It really is a great lesson in being aware, right now...every day.Enjoy."
2,Plain & Simple?,This book about Buddhism says it's plain & simple. I found it to be neither plain nor simple. I really wanted an easy to understand description or insight into Buddhism but did not find it here.
2,Inaccessible,"I have to agree with petersmaclean. I have no prior knowledge of Buddhism and picked up this book out of intellectual curiosity. I finished it, after having forced myself to get through it all. The book is written in a fluffy and nebulous way. The author talks of ""seeing"" (if I see that word in italics again I'm going to puke), and his explanations build off of weak analogies. When I put the book down, I felt I had no substantial knowledge of Buddhism, aside from some foggy notion of enlightenment. Towards the end, the book reads like a cult handbook. I got the feeling that it only makes sense once you've bought into it."
2,Patience . . .,"I'm glad I have other sources re Zen, because if it were only this book I checked, it would be history. The editorial review at the beginning said: ""You might want to digest this book slowly, a few pages at a time."" Otherwise, you may want to toss the book across the room.It seems very circular and unclear to me what point he's trying to make, and that isn't the case with other authors."
5,Plain and Simple? Maybe not,This book is one of the most life altering reads of My 55years. My Ego is strong and my soul is steeped in the academic knowledge of Western Culture. Steve Hagan succeeds in explaining the Buddha's transformation to enlightenmemt and his affect upon his contemporary world and the following 2500 years of human existence without preaching and with respect for other philosophical concepts. I can honestly say my life has been made better and happier by the experience of reading this book.
5,Wow.,"This book cuts through all the cultural stuff to expose the heart of Buddhism, is amazingly clear as to what the Buddha taught, and explains in practical terms how his teachings can be applied to our daily life. I recommend it to anyone who wants to find out about Buddhism, whether you are a complete layman or someone who has been studying it for years."
5,Best Book I have read on Buddhism yet,"Buddhism has always interested me and i have read many dumb-downed and ""how-to"" books on the subject with great disappointment. This book summarizes the true philosophy of Buddhism. It is not boring, and you do not need much prior knowledge of Buddhism to get the jist of this book."
4,Good Book,"I haven't read much about Buddhism so this is the perspective of someone who is fairly new at the subject. I found this book very clear written and to the point. The book is as the title suggests ""plain and simple"". I would definitely recommend it to someone wanting to learn about the basics of Buddhism or someone who wants a different perspective on living. The ""plain and simple"" concept is also visible in the content itself making it a very refreshing view of a way of life. It's not trying to convert you into Buddhism which is great. Its focus is to inform the reader of basics. I did find it ended a bit fast. I wish there was a sequel to it that goes deeper into the subject in the same informative, plain and simple way."
2,If your looking for an unbiased look at Buddhism look somewhere else,I bought this book to give me a nice overview of Buddhism. I was encouraged by the introduction. Unfortunitly after that the author began to make fun of every other religion. I know that buddhism isn't about that. And i think by putting people on the defense about their childhood religon will make it very difficult for them to remain openminded to the spiritually enlightening concepts that buddhism has to offer.
1,Pick a different book,This book was not helpful to me. I found it confusing and redundant. I strongly recommend buying a different book.
1,TOO PLAIN AND TOO SIMPLE,"IF YOU DID NOT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT BUDDHISM BEFORE YOU READ THIS BOOK, YOU WOULD NOT KNOW ANYTHING AFTER YOU READ IT. AFTER ONLY THIRTY MINUTES I THREW THIS BOOK IN THE TRASH CAN. IT WAS 15 MINUTES MORE THAN I SHOULD HAVE GIVEN IT."
2,Buzz Kill,"Taking under consideration all of the 5 Star Reviews, I was disappointed. It started off really good but the author seemed to belabor the same point over and over and over... It was like a movie that starts off really good and never reaches a climax. I would go to a book store and read the first chapter to get the whole gist."
4,It Helped Me Get Started,I was reading Huston Smiths World Relgions at the same time and let me tell you.I read Buddhism Plain And Simple once and understood what Steve Hagen was saying.World Religions is a classic and great book that has more depth but for some people it takes a longer time to sink in.They should be sold together.Take Care as always.....
2,No Bibliography?,"This book started out slow for me. Buddhism Plain and Simple seemed to be to the Dharma what hardtack is to bread. It grew on me and many of it's insights are beautifully written and invaluable for those studying the Dharma. However, the work remains deeply flawed because there is so much left out. I can only imagine someone picking up this book and instantly thinking they are some kind of Zen master because all there is to Zen is seeing. There is also a certain cultural superiority implied in the work, decrying what Hagen views as cultural accretions. The problem I find untenable, however, is a complete lack of notes or bibliography. Even where Hagen directly quotes someone, no sources are given, no translators, zilch, nada. This isn't Zen iconoclasm. This is just lazy writing."
5,Accessable Enlightenment,"Steve Hagen strips away the cultural shrouds that can convolute and confuse the fundamentals of this ""non-religion"", presenting Buddhism's powerful simplicity in an accessible way.No matter what your spiritual background this book can profoundly enrich your life."
3,"More one man's opinion, than a straight teaching of Buddhism.","I read Buddhism Plain and Simple in hopes that I would increase my very basic knowledge of Buddhism. However, this book is very much just an opinion on life given by Steven Hagen. I did find the book interesting, and would recommend it to someone who wants to get the idea of what Buddhism is all about, but would not recommend it to someone that wants to expand their knowledge of Buddhism. The author even states in the book that he does not consider himself a Buddhist, even though he has studied it for decades. So overall, it's a good book if your looking for something very ""plain and simple"", but don't expect anything complex"
2,Ummmm....Plain & Simple???,"Some of this is written for a child & some of it is written in a foreign language, which literally had me going WTH??? I have done some reading on Buddhism & am looking to learn more, this was a HUGE letdown, to say the least!"
4,"Buddhism, Plain and Simple","Good description of the principles. Tone is a little negative. Too much Duhkka; not enough of the happy Buhdda, but very good for the nubie faced with a bunch of troubles."
4,widens split between philosophy and religion,"This book presents Buddhism as a practical, realistic, and agnostic philosphy. But for the vast majority of people in the world who call themselves Buddhists, Buddhism is a *religion* complete with deities, prayer, priests and lamas, and scriptures that give detailed rules of behavior and a system of punishments and rewards in the afterlives based on one's obedience to those rules. While the philosophy in this book resonates with my own, I wonder if it is accurate to call it Buddhism. Anyway, if you like the philosophy in this book I think you will also like ""Buddhism without Beliefs"" by Batchelor."
5,Great Book,I do not generally take the time to write long reviews. I spend my time living and I read a lot of non-fiction books with the desire to deepen it. I submit ratings for those books I loved most. This is one of them. Read it. Live it. Then graduate to Tolle - who must be listened to. Get his CDs.
1,Simply vapid,"The author writes as though information about things that are easy to conceptualize but hard to do, like paying continuous and close attention to the present moment as it happens, is best conveyed as though writing for simpletons. The result is a prose style so cloying and insipid as to verge on the unreadable. If you want to find out about Buddhism or meditation (which are really interesting; more so than you might think) try Mindfulness in Plain English."
1,Huh?,"I had read several other books about Buddhism before I picked up this one, and I have to say it did not live up to its title. After reading it, I still found Buddhism to be bewildering. (Of course, that could also be due to the fact that its practitioners seem to be in a tooth-and-nail competition to show how enlightened they are by being as obtuse and incomprehensible as possible.) Anyway, this book did nothing to clear things up for me.It has been a few years since I read the book, and my spiritual journey has taken me to a way different place than where I was at the time...so maybe I should thank Mr. Hagen for keeping me from pursuing Buddhism any further. Personally, I think there are better basic explanatory books on Buddhism, like *The Heart of the Buddha's Teaching* by Thich Nhat Hanh. Mr. Hagen's book will leave you just as puzzled as you were before you read it."
1,Buddhism Plain and Simple,"By trying to make it simple the author ended by distort the content and make it painful to read. the author try desperately to sound knowledgeable but it sound more like it really did not get the fundamentals of Buddha's teaching. he preach instead of showing a way, enumerate instead showing a path. the book will bring only confusion to anybody rather than opening the mind. it is not a realization of our suffering but rather a mirror of Mr Hagen own distraction on believing or trying to be a zen master. Obviously having been allowed the title of teacher went straight to the head of the person but certainly did not enlighten him. well at least that what i felt and that is my own feeling. i would recommend to start with other reading materials."
3,Conceptualizing the Non-Conceptual,"I enjoyed ""Buddhism: Plain and Simple."" It's a thought-provoking overview of Buddhism. My copy is filled with margin notes and underlined passages.That said, some readers might be put off by the book's abstract and argumentative tone. Virtually every page barks out one single command at the reader: ""Don't conceptualize reality. Just SEE reality. And see it NOW!"" (The author is incredibly repetitive.) Overall, the book would be far more helpful if the author had taken pains to guide the reader through the process of awakening, showing what an awakened life means in practice and how it changes our perceptions and conduct. Incredibly, meditation is treated in just a few pages, as if seeing reality now (or NOW!) is mostly a matter of will power. And if the phrase ""loving-kindness"" appears in the book at all, I can't recall it.The whole thing is surprisingly didactic and theoretical for a book coming out of the Zen tradition."
4,Underated,"I bought this cd because my man burned ""Glow"" on a cd for me. I liked dat song so much that i decided i had 2 buy da album. Dis cd iz worth every dolla."
4,Original Future World: Fascinating & Mysterious,"If you are tired of the run-of-the-mill sci-fi/fantasy, swords & sorcery genre; if you are a fan of fine writers, such as: Jim Grimsley, Michael Lowenthal, Trebor Healy; if you enjoy the tales of: Tanith Lee and Storm Constantine, then plunge into this unique intriguing future world.A wonderful original romantic thriller which takes place after Global Warming has all but destroyed the earth which is now mostly covered by ocean.The gay characters are refreshing and enjoyable, albeit one is a ""new aqua-human"".Keegan is a treasure. After reading this, I will seek out all of his other works."
4,Great!,"If I could put four and a half stars I would. I just can't bring myself to rate it with five. I love gay romance/thrillers anything really. But this book took me by surprise.The only bad thing I have toi say about the whole book is there are quite a few grammatical errors. But if you want to read a nice, fast paced novel that draws you into the story this is the one for you!"
1,Unhappy I thought it was somethingg that it wasn't very miss leading.,Yeah this wasn't anything that the descriptionMade it sound like @ all. Very unhappy w/ what I receicved. Not a happy Camper @ all.So that's that don't know what else 2 say other than I thought I was getting a double DVDBox set with all musoc & it's some cheezy Documentary fdrom Europian TV that's not even legit.
3,Third Ear Band - 'Live Ghosts' (Materiali Sonori),"Live release of a decent reunion - took place between Aug.-Sept. 1988. Original members Glenn Sweeney {drums} and Paul Minns {oboe} are joined by Mick Carter {guitar} and Alan Samuel {violin}. Liked the highly experimental raga rocker, the thirteen-minute free form piece ""More Mosaic"" and probably the somewhat intriguing ""Chetto Raga"" the best. Have to admit I was sort of amused by the sappy violin playing during the title track ""Live Ghosts"". Lived the 'Hymn To The Sphynx' 2-CD better (see my review)."
4,great video for the untrained who still want a challenge,"I have been doing video workouts for about 8 yrs. I started this one by walking a mile or two, and then doing a segment or two of the video, until I was able to do the entire video in one workout. I like a little challenge, and felt it did a nice job on my core. This is a good one for the over 50 crowd.Patty"
2,Probably need dance experience..,"This workout program was mediocre in my opinion. I tried to do this for 15 minutes and became frustrated because they would simply do the moves without explaining how to do them or going through them slowly at first. I don't have dance experience so it was frustrating because I couldn't just pick up the moves. I need a little bit more structure than just watching someone do it then being told to copy them. I'm going back to my Biggest Loser Workout Vol. 1, which is more structured with easier moves to do."
1,Hardly a workout!,"I expected this video to be a fun, high-energy cardio workout - I barely broke a sweat! The routines were entirely too easy, I found myself bored the whole time. I'm not in good shape, I don't work out (hardly ever!) and I'm not a dancer - this video should've kicked my butt and it did nothing of the sort. Save your money, this video isn't worth it!"
2,YAWN!!!,"As someone who LOVES to dance, this was so/so. Crunch FItness usually puts together workout DVD's better than this, so in my opinion they rushed to slap this together because of the popularity of the show and nothing more! Watch the dancer Michelle! She looks as totally BORED as I was! This might be for the extreme beginner or the hesitant to workout person, but a dancer or someone who is experienced will be totally disenchanted."
5,great size...,These are perfect for what I intend using them for. It is the exact size that is needed for little xmas gifts.
5,Great Product!,Perfect for my pendants I'm selling online. I put them in this baggy then a bubble mailer and all is well.. Good Stuff!!
4,Lots of bags,"I am not a huge fan of plastic bags and wish I could have gotten a smaller quantity but these are sturdy, close well, and do the trick for storing extra Lego pieces from individual kits in an organized way (as opposed to on my cookie sheets with the Lego creation they came with.)"
5,Must read,"This is a well-written book on the subject of process or business reengineering. It is written in a non-technical language, wastes few words, and covers the entire spectrum of topics that are essential to a successful reengineering effort. The discussions place a significant emphasis on the role that information or computer technology play today in the reengineering effort, particularly how this technology can facilitate the overall effort. I found the book largely sticking to the overall thread however at times it did become a wee bit academic to flip through the sections. All in all, a very good read."
4,"Honest, insightful","With its enigmatic cover, and telling epigraph from poet Wallace Stevens, Awful Gestures, by Adrienne Weiss, itself is a gesture-it holds itself out, offering startling lyrical poems. Highlights include the narrative ""American Windows""; the highly personal ""At the Anne Frankhuis"" in which a daughter and her father come to grips with a haunting revelation; ""We are at carnival"" sinisterly uses the fun house as a metaphor for one girl's concept of her companion's beauty; and ""Stay"" is wrenchingly honest in its portrayal of love lost. Though some of the poems seem stunted, and unfinished, this is, overall, a rich debut from a young poet."
2,OK for a TOY,"Currie (Schwinn) scooters are not what they used to be. All of the latest versions are poor hill climbers. Don't expect much more power with an S-1000, you wont get it. If you're crusing around on flat surfaces; they'll both move you up to 12-15 mph, but that's it."
3,Spinning Inward,Not as good as I expected thought there would be more stories to read for my yoga class during savasana
1,Very Disappointed with the Quality,"We purchased this for my 8 yr. old daughter, within 1 day it was broken. We even bought a refill and could not get it to work correctly. The door keeps coming off. Very Poor quality."
3,Great item....where are the refills???,"My daughter received this toy for her 9th birthday in August. She absolutely loves it, but she used all of the sticker paper in one week. We have searched for refills, but have had no luck, so the toy is now shoved under her bed."
3,"Good product, but...","My 6 year old daughter received this as a gift for Christmas, but it sat around for a couple of months, as we never had a moment to put it together. Then, my daughter has a friend over (also 6) and they are playing rather quietly in her room. I went in to check on them and lo and behold, they have the Sticker Maker put together and are making stickers (sorry to those adults who have had such problems putting it together...but if two 6-year olds can do it...). She seems to really enjoy it, but of course, we have now run out of the roll of sticker maker stuff and cannot find a refill. These kind of products should always come with a way to buy refills!!!!!"
2,Jammed quickly - not worth buying.,My daughter bought this with birthday money and it jammed on the first day she played with it. We can't get the sticker roll out and she is very disappointed. Don't bother with this toy. Buy a better one made for scrapbooking. The look on my daughter's face when this broke was heart-breaking.
3,Good idea but....,I bought this sticker maker as a gift. I think it is a good idea however I wonder if it would have been better to buy one at a scrapbooking store. I have one that my daughter likes to use. It would be easier to find refills as well.
1,What a piece of JUNK!!,We have had two of these things and both are nothing but junk! That they charge $20 for it is a crime! It gets jammed with every turn and it only increases the waste of stickers and tape. Don't spend a precious dime on this piece of junk toy!
2,polly pocket sticker maker,My daughter loves the sticker maker but she used the cartridge in one day and still has plenty of stickers left to make and I can not find the refills anywhere. They need to make the refills for these types of toys easier to get. I am to hesitant to buy the bead maker now because of that and I know my daughter would like it but It's a waste if it's a one time use and upsets my daughter.
1,Is that it??,"My 7 year old got this for Christmas this year. I put it together, got every thing loaded. She was right on top of me...couldn't wait....anxiously waiting...are you done yet are you done yet....everything was set to go....she turns the crank...out comes a couple stickers....She looks up at me...""ehhh is that it?""we put it back in the box and now it goes to Goodwill.My daughter said...I have lots of stickers that aren't so much trouble."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY,"The instructions are not very good. It is very cheaply made, and hard to work. I would save your money and not buy this one. Your daughter will be much happier in the long run."
1,No Axl Rose?,One of the best performances was when Axl Rose and Tom Petty sang Free Fallin'.I also agree that is missing the Pearl Jam-Neil Young performance of Rockin' in the Free World
5,A great written history of mountain aviation in Montana.,"Steve Smith's book about the history of Johnson's flying Service is an exciting realistic account of Bob Johnson's flying legacy. Smith incorporates many anecdotes, historical accounts and factual information about mountain aviation. If you like to read about Ford Trimotors, brave pilots, and Montana history, you should read this book."
5,Awesome record!,"This record is sooooo awesome! These guys have got talent! I love pressing on, and sadie hawkins dance is so cute!"
3,It's All right,"Okay...this isn't a bad cd...but it's not that great. Catchy, yes...poppy and fun, yes...however, it is INCREDIBLY cheesy...I'm talkin' straight up Velveeta...I can't imagine anyone other than thirteen year old girls really getting into this...the guitar work is pretty good, if a little simple...the vocals are great, and the harmonies are spot on, but the lyrics could be written by a monkey smahing the keys on a typewriter...I've certainly heard worse...but they could use a little creativity...the chorus of ""Down in Flames"", for example...how many times can you repeat the same three words and still feel comfortable realeasing it to the public??? It seems as though they took a survey of the most popular punk bands, and then wrote one song to match the style of each. It's not bad to have if you play it at a time when you can ignore the sometimes aggrivating repetiveness. I mean seriously, 'Maybe it's Maybeline'?? Come on..."
3,"""Sadie Hawkins"" is Great, Other Tracks Mostly Just Good","Relient K's ""Anatomy"" is a mix of distinctive-but-not-groundbreaking upbeat secular and Christian pop punk tracks. While the lyrical strength wavers, the band's instrumentation is consistently tight and catchy. ""Sadie Hawkins Dance"" is timeless fun for everyone. A few of the tracks are definitely inside baseball directed at Christians and the Christian church, and some may find a few of them preachy. Overall, ""Anatomy"" is an unabashedly Christian and goofy album with many fun tracks by a group of talented entertainers, but does not draw me back for repeated listens to any track other than ""Sadie Hawkins"". Though much more vulgar, blink-182 is my pop punk choice for my daily playlists. (Updated February 15, 2011 - yes, seven years later!)"
5,GREAT!!!,"This is a great cd! Track 3 is the best track on the entire disc! I just got their new EP ""Employee of the Month"" and their new sound is great! Oh yeah if you want to know what Relient K sound like, they kind of sound like a mix between Saves the Day, Blink-182, and New Found Glory all in one! This is definately a CD for everyone! It's so good. One of the best emo/pop-punk groups out there! Buy this and also think abou purchasing Midtown Save the World Loose the Girl while your hear! Buy now!!"
2,NOT WORTH THE MONEY,THIS IS NOT A VERY GOOD CD THERES ONLY 3 GOOD SONGS ON HERE PRESSING ON SADIE HAWKINS AND THE MOMENTS I FEEL FAINT. THE REST ARE KIND OF DUMB LIKE MAYBE ITS MAYBELINE LION WILSON LION O AND MAY THE HORSE BE WITH YOU AND BREAKFAST AT TIMPANIS AND etc........... i just heard it when i saw a music video of pressing on witch i got to admit is a very cool song so i bought it bad mistake. if your looking for christian based punk bands check out slick shoes mxpx and ace troubleshooter do not i repeat do not by this cd the first song talks for itself
1,LMAO...,"First off any type of punk/pop is obviously awful, and these guys go beyond awful. Listen to the high pitched nasal voices so commonly used in this genre of music! Who are they trying to fool...heterosexual is def a word they aren't familiar with. THe cd is terrible, with every song having the same upbeat tempo and lack of musical talent....One of my best friends loves this group, what a shame!!! Do urself a favor and buy real metal with talent such as Byzantine, Soilwork, Meshuggah, Children of Bodom, and Darkane, etc, etc...."
1,"This CD was a joke, Right?","I'm gonna be brutally honest with you, I thought this cd was a joke when i first heard sadie hawkins dance. i listened to a few other songs, and this is the dumbest cd i've ever heard. the lyrics of sadie hawkins just made me laugh. a friend of mine played this in the car on the way to school once and we almost threw him out the door, not to mention we still make fun of him about it. for this of you who actually like this, go put your head in a microwave or something, and listen to good music, i suggest pearl jam, but if your into punk, then blink and brand new are good, not this crap"
2,relient K,"This band is alright. The beat is definately perfect for a punk band, but the lyrics are so emo and christian. I think you shouldnt waste ur time on this one and go for maybe pennywise, millencolin, anti-flag, rancid, operation ivy, dropkick murpheys, etc. Those are the true bands in punk today, but if you wanna get original...go for some ramones or misfits. all awesome bands...check em out"
3,"repetitive & predictable, but u can sing along with it","i was all excited when i brought this cd home from the store. their first cd was great...how could this one be any less? well, it was. there's 17 tracks on this disc, 15 of them are songs (if you count the intro as a song) and a secret track that's pretty weird. after about the first 6 or so go by they start sounding repetitive. almost every song gets slower & softer before the end, and they repeat phrases, lines & whole songs a lot. ex- 'the rest is up to you' gets said so many times it made me want to skip the song. 'these words are not enough' is a 3 line song, yet it goes on for 4:40, and there's not a long instrumental part to pad the time. still, the melodies are singable & catchy and the words are good. i'd still reccomend buying it - individually the songs are great, just don't listen to it straight through too often, or the intro will apply to you."
4,Much Needed Maturity,"I will admit I was a fan of the first album, but it was beginning to wear a bit thin. It seemed like their whole gimmick was to write very catchy songs about pop culture. Yet, I love them because I know they are great guys and I love them in concert. I picked up their ep at a concert this summer and was blown away. The sound was fresh and mature. The new album continues this. The songs rarely fall back onto pop culture novelties (i. e. Marilyn Manson), and show an improvement not only musically but lyrically. The album contains a good mix between pop-punk and slower worship style songs. The best song on the disc is also the most different ""Less is More"". Piano driven and sung straight from the heart, it is a great way to end the album, not including the humourous hidden track. I give this 4 stars based on the improvement from the last album and the potential for things to come. By the way, try to pick up the Creepy EP, it contains their best song ""Jefferson Airplane""."
4,reliant k ROCKS,"I drive a Plymouth Relient K and was searching for some info about it on the internet. in the processs i came accross a site for a band called Relient K. of course i had to find out more, so i downloaded some songs. i instantly knew i had to go buy the entire CD. The Anatomy of the tongue in cheek is definitly their best CD. the songs are upbeat and have a positive message. some are comical, some are serious, but almost all are fun to listen too."
4,Cool Band,"This band was just introduced to me and i went home and downloaded three of their songs, loved them, and bought the cd!! Its really awesome!"
2,It was ok,"When i first got this cd, i wasn't sure what to really expect, the first two songs on this cd, ""Sadie Hawkins Dance"" and ""Pressing On"" were amazing, but it went no where but down hill after that. There is no need to mix pop/punk with religious beliefs, its just selling religion. They have always had the potential to be an awesome band, and they've just proved me right with their new cd ""Two lefts don't make a right...but three do"" This cd has totaly changed my perception, of this previously lacking band. This is easily the best cd to date for Relient K, and the one that will take them to the top."
4,Sex in the City Sequel,"This is the story of five women who meet in prenatal yoga and become friends throughout the first year of mothering. Its pretty outrageous - I didn't find myself relating to these characters, this book felt more like an escape. I call it the sex-in-the-city-sequel because its as if all the characters from that show went and had babies. I don't know what mothering in the big apple is like."
5,IT WORKS!!!,"Better than described. Won't charge a dead battery, but sure keeps one perked up. A must need for items in storage, or needing a boost to keep healthy."
4,Perfect,"Just what I was looking for. Living in Europe, I needed a dual voltage charger that I could still use when I return to the US. Easy to use, includes pigtails (which wasn't clear on the package) so there's no need to order these as an accessory."
5,Does everything you need,"I have 3 mtorcycles and use these on all of them to keep the batteries fresh and to prolong battery life. Compact, tough and waterproof; these units are great for use in the garage."
1,Failed after two months,"Failed after only two months. Disappointed. I did nothing extraordinary, or abuse the charger. Just kept a 12v deep cycle charged in the float mode."
3,"It's ok, but...","Beware. If you need a strong trickle charger, this ain't it. It's not necessarily a problem w/ the product, it's just somewhat misleading if you're battery needs stronger amperes."
1,THIS IS NOT SOLAR!!,THIS IS NOT SOLAR!! DON'T BE SCAMMED. THIS REQUIRES AN ELECTRICAL OUTLET IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN THE BATTERY/ELECTRICAL SYSTEM OF AN RV.
5,"Have 2, work great, no worries about being outside.","I have 2 of these now, and they work great. I have them hooked up outside, and I dont have to worry about bringing them in. Light indicators on the chargers seem to be accurate. I have never had any problems with this product. Plus the kit come with clip or permanent attachment setup. Nice product!!"
2,great units until they crap out,"The 800 is a good charger for outdoor applications. The only problem with Deltran products is that they have a tendency to crap out after about two years of service. This is the second Deltran charger that died on me after two years. The warranty is a sham as they need the original receipt and will not pick up any of the shipping costs.Returned units are subject to handling, inspection and repair fees.A new unit retails for $52 plus sh the Deltran site about what they want to repair your old unit. Amazon lists a new unit for about $35, a much better deal. Unless you really need a waterproof charger go with a CETEK."
2,Broke,Mine broke in less then a year. Didn't like it very much when it was working. LED's didn't work right. Can't recommend.
2,Worked great for 22 months,"At first I posted ""Great product. I have numerous boat and motorcycle batteries not to mention the lawn mower that I use these tenders on. The battery life is extended a year or two on each. These machines are also ready to go when I need them"". And now I have to add--This tender worked great for 22 months. When I called the manufacturer they said that it would cost me $12.95 in shipping to get the new one. This is after I paid to ship the defective one to them. I would recommend some of their other models that have a longer warranty, this seems to say something. Most are 5 years and this one is 3 years."
5,Im pleased,Functions as advertised and waterproof at that (havent tested that) but good solid unit and doesnt break the bank. I wired in the plug mount to my atv for fast hookups and think it would come in nice for some of my offroad vehicles that are to big to fit into the shop and stay outside in the weather.
5,The Battery Tender does deliver,The device performs as advertised................. Attached to a Sea Doo and continues to deliver a charged battery. I would recommend this charger.
3,Deltran Battery Tender 800,"I have some friends that own these units and are very pleased. I bought 2 for my boat to keep the batteries up, but one failed after the first night, maybe. I have contacted Deltran Corp and told them what is happening with the unit and waiting for a response back from them. Might be doing something wrong, but don't think so. The other unit works great and might be just one of those things that happens to electronics now day just one little fault and bam everything shuts down."
5,Worth the $,"I've tried all of the ""other"" chargers, and this one delivers for AGM batteries. It's convenient smaller package is much nicer then the older ""metal box"" version. I'll be buying another."
5,Great Tender,"My husband wanted it, I got it. It is exactly what we expected and needed. I am happy that I found such a good deal on it here!"
4,Works great,Got a good price on a good charger thats works great outside in my carport. Hopefully Battery Tender keeps making a quality product as this is my 5th one bought for my vehicles!
5,lots of connections.,Comes with every connection you would need. Long cords for easy plug in and set up. I have it ran under my cover to my bike and still have enough cord to put it up on the shelf. Also I like i don't have to worry about the changing temperatures inside the garage because it is waterproof. Very happy with the purchase
5,Review Battery Tender 800 Charger,"No issues, just as described. Currently have owned 3 Battery Tender 800 chargers for over a year with no problems. Use the chargers on two tractors and jet ski."
2,Could be alot better,"This dvd does display some great hardcore wrestling, but it is not worth the money. It clocks in at just over an hour, and includes a total of 6 matches. Not all the matches are even shown in full. Your best bet is to order the king of the death match one or two, because the matches are just off those events. save your money on this one folks!"
4,Another Fun Blue's Clues Book,A fun book for kids. It gives clues in the form of ryhmes with little pictures to help kids figure out the answers.
2,"Just ""OK""","This is a rather flimsy product, but for the price what do you expect.It is touchy and can mutilate the egg when you use it if you do no do so just right. I find that you need to place it on the egg just right (the flared end down) and you need to firmly hold it in place and give it a slight twist as you slice. This seems to produce the best cut but requires just the right touch."
1,"Used once, then it bent","The title says it all. The hole's too small for large eggs, and the first time I used this the handles bent and it became unworkable. Don't waste your money."
5,I love Everquest!,"I was a beta3 tester, playing as Soullessone. This was the first online game I played with PS2. I loved this game and can't wait until it comes out. The gameplay was endless and it was great fun to talk and play with other players online. For example, you can form groups with other characters and go hunting with them. I hope I get to keep my beta character."
4,AWESOME,"I love this game its the best game i have for PS2.The reason i rated it 4 stars is because you have to pay.there are 4 servers to start from(towns)and each is special in a way.one of the best parts of the game is grouping(teaming up)because you can fight the hardest monsters and share exp.play with your friends too.buy weopons,armor,bows,ect. to make your character one of the best."
4,This is the best rpg ever!!!,If you haven't played his game you are missing out. This has to be the best rpg game ever!!! It has great graphics and has a ton of people to talk to. If you buy this game join my guild Legion of the Shadows or you can make your own guild thats whats so cool about this game you can battle any creature. If you are good you can keep the creatures as pets. This has to be the best ps2 online game ever.
4,fun game,"it was very good, like all their PC games. It had really cool graphics and it was a lot of fun playing with other kids from around the world. It is a must have game if you are into fantcy stuff."
4,Online only but great,"First off this game is Not like the PC version as it takes place some 500 years before the PC version. the graphics are good for a MMORPG and there is a wide viriety of characters to craete. There are plety of servers and for each servers, one can make up to seven charaters. there are Barbarians, Elves, Dark elves, Dwarves, trolls, Haflings, all which can be Enchanters, CLerics, Warriors, Shadow KNights and many many more combinations. with that many combinations there is definately something for new players and Veteran MMORPGs alike. this is an excellent game and i would recomend it to anyone that likes RPGs of all kind."
2,Review based on previous experience with SOE,"I played Everquest. I never had a single good experience with the good folks at Sony Online Entertainment. The people that bring us Everquest and Everquest Online Adventures. While the game had it's good points, and was occasionally fun, I don't think it is worth the risk.The computer game still has bugs that were listed as bugs by beta testers, years after beta was done with and several expansions later. When there is a problem with the game it is always a problem with your setup, never with their funky/broken code. I would expect these problems to be less frequent with the PS2 version, but I would probably be disappointed.I have to agree with the person who said to wait and play Final Fantasy XI. That is what I plan to do. I won't throw any more money at SOE, it is a lost cause."
3,"nice, breezy pop with an unexpected edge","Cinnamon are a brilliant mix of loopy keyboards, guitar rock, lounge textures and honey-sweet vocals, laced with unexpectedly biting lyrics. However, in my opinion these elements were captured better on their debut release, ""The Courier."" Check it out for a nice introduction to the fantastic world of Cinnamon."
5,Many Moods Indeed,"Cinnamon are amazing. Let's just say that. I came across Cinnamon on ebay. They were being compared to Frente. All they really have in common though is the singer's voices. This Ep is one of my favorite cinnamon albums. it mixes all their best elements. And boy can they rock! Try it out! And listen to my favorite song ""Scorpio Rising"" Which is only available here. If you have the time..I'd also highly recommend their first 2 swedish albums. Pop at it's finest."
3,"Good, but not as good as The Courier","Cinnamon's prior album, The Courier, is their best work so far. Start there if you don't have anything by them yet. Every track on The Courier is excellent. It's one of the strongest albums I've ever heard."
3,A synthesized orchestra?,"All but four of these 150 titles are performed by the Ray Hamilton Orchestra. The other four are performed by the Gary Tesca Orchestra.Before I get too critical, let me emphasize this is not bad for the money. That being said, dance DJs and serious collectors should be advised that this ""orchestra"" sounds very much like it is synthesized. The strings aren't. The somewhat monotonous percussion is supplied but what appears to be a reasonably good drum machine. The non-piano keyboards are often in a cheesy 1970s style.We tried to listen while on a long road trip, and hit the ""next track"" button on three out of four tracks. The Latin is better than the smooth, but there is little that makes make me want to dance. . .All of these were released as individual volumes. If time permits, I will review each volume under its own title."
1,WASTED MONEY,"If it were possible to give this book a negative rating, I would have. Without a doubt, it was the worst book I have read dealing with business matters/consulting.When I ordered this book, I did so based upon other reviews talking about the book having ""no fluff"", etc... I can assure you that nothing is farther from the truth. There is little if any ""meat"" to this book. Instead, I found it to contain only general ideas and nothing of practical use.Did I mention that the book has only 97 pages? Frankly, as I read the book, I found it as nothing more than a pretext to offer the authors other products such as their ""seminar in a box"".Hopefully, I will be able to spare someone else the misfortune of buying this book. If you are so inclined, re-read this review and if you are still unconvinced, wait and buy it used if you must. Your level of irritation and dissatisfaction will be much less if you do."
5,I really got some great advice from the book!!!,"Not only was it a great book to read but it will be a wonderful reference guide for me when these situations arise. The checklist on how to assess a client's file was great! There are many things that I do that were listed, but several things were good areas that need to be reviewed (which I haven't done) which has ended up being a surprise for both the client and myself.There are so many useful ideas in here, especially about the proposal for services and the fax to send people who want free advice. It answers all those questions that you feel you aren't sure who to ask and have to experiment to get the right answer!"
3,Mediocre,"Not very flavorful. I didn't even notice it was only 1 can of hme not 2. The ""premium packs"" that have 2 cans taste much better than this."
3,Starting point,"The kits are ok but you really need additional ingredients like dry malt extract, finishing hops, and brown sugar or honey to boost alc%. Beer really takes about 5weeks to mature properly anyways. In hind sight you can get a 5gal kit for about $55 with alot better ingredients packs and control of your brews from ""the hops shack"". you cant make beer fast enough to keep up with the average beer drinker with 2gal kits thats a fact, and you cant share it with friends or you will be out very quickly."
3,Presentation vrs intructions,"Hi there,I recieved the refill pack,, as well as have to say the good conditions I recieve that pack, there is no match between the presentation and what I recieve, for example reciepe says: "" two cans "" and recieve one can and one bag, also dont come instrucions of how to use the one step sanitizing bag,"
4,nuggets to the ear,There is moodyful beauty that comes out of chris and Carlas music. This music is for the delicate listener. One who prefers to listen to their music instead of just hearing it. Great music for the early morning or in the darkness of the night with spilling snowflakes.
5,Book Arrived safely in great condition,"Book arrived quickly and in great condition. I have become a fan of the author since reading 'I, Lucifer' and I have enjoyed this book also."
4,Strangely erotic,"I read this book about 6 months ago, and enjoyed it to the nth degree.The anguish expierenced by the main charachter was very plausable. Although at times I did become confused with the addition of some lengthy parts which did not fit in with the rest of the story."
5,What Mage: the Ascension *should* have been...,"This is an incredible piece of work. Those who (like myself) were dissatisfied with the latest edition of M:tA should like this game. The rules are crisp and clearly written. The magic system is simple and easy to use.In order to understand the basic concept, try to picture Call of Cthulhu where the good guys actually get to *fight* the horrors! In fact, I can see how several CoC scenarios could fit into the WC tableau with very few changes to the plots themselves.If you like horror roleplaying, but don't like CoC's tendency to leave your heroes a gibbering pile of insanity or don't really like White Wolf's ""angst,"" then definitely give WitchCraft a try."
2,Ruin (Most) Everything!,"The only song on this album that doesn't manage to bore me to tears is the first track. The vocals aren't so hot on any of the tracks, but the music on the first is at least good if derivative... I can't listen to any of the others and actually enjoy them."
1,CD by Allegro Corporation,"this is the worst recording I've ever heard, is really a crap.It seems that the singers are sung in a room that echoesI am sure that a record like this would never be sold in Europe.Donizetti - L'elisir d'amore / Pavarotti Freni Nucci Montarsolo"
1,"Great opera, but don't buy this recording.","This is such a disappointing recording. The audience noise, including audible sneezes and coughs, seriously interferes with the music. This recording does a disservice to the music."
1,Not what I thought,Great shipping received it fast. But it was not what i thought it was. There is no laser with this product you have to buy it too. So my fault for not reading description enough!!
5,Crucial reminder of the true meaning of dignity,"This book captures the essence of the meaning of dignity. By giving voice to a range of women in her life Drucilla Cornell gives us all an example of what it means to really listen to all the women in our lives-mothers, sisters, daughters, friends, neighbors. Cornell reminds us that by bearing witness to each other's dignity-which must be done with respect for all of our differences-we start on the path of creating a better world. What an important and refreshing reminder for such a complicated world!"
4,A good starter book for bowing,"Having been an electric bass player for 25+ years I recently purchased an NS double bass. I bought this book to be able to get introduced to bowing. It's a good starter book if you've never done any bowing on a double bass. Not in tab, so it keeps me up on sight reading. The CD is a plus with playing along and getting the right sound with the bow. Beginner level songs. Well worth the money."
2,Puzzled,"I am not sure about this: I bought this method as a complement to Simandl, after reading that it would get me playing up the neck sooner. It does, however there are a couple issues: there is no a clear description of the positions, and of the technique used (pivoting). Since this is Vol 1, I expected all the basics explained here. Do I need to buy the Vade Mecum as well? Also, the method uses the G clef for thumb position: it certainly helps notation, but it means I have to transpose to the new key. Overall, this is a strange combination of extremely basic tunes (Twinkle Little Star) and obscure technique. I must be missing something."
4,Darling Daughters,Haven't read yet but know I will enjoy as I have read several of Debbie Macomber books.
4,Darling Daughters,"While I enjoyed both stories in this book...I was a bit put off by the story ""Yours and Mine"" because every word that should have had a ""z"" in it, had an ""s"" instead.....was the ""z"" key missing on the PC that day? ""realised"" ""recognised"" ""COSY""?!!!!"
4,Short Bursts of Good Horror,"I recently started a horror blog, and being a horror film enthusiast, I wanted to expand my taste in horror, specifically books and music. Horror anthologies were the first books I looked into because I am still busy with classes and work at the university. These short stories are incredible, and I was amazed at the variation of storytelling, style and content. Some of the best horror authors are a part of this anthology along with some newcomers to the genre. I am very pleased with this purchase, and I plan on purchasing the other horror anthologies avaialble in the Dark Delacacies series, which I found two other books available after this first installment."
2,"Oh, dear Lord!","With all due respect to the previous reviewers, all I can say is - What the blue blazes were they thinking when they gave this book 4 or 5 stars?!I've spent the last 20 or so years savoring the works of numerous authors in the horror genre, including Stephen King, Dean R. Koontz, Edgar Allan Poe, H.P. Lovecraft, M.R. James, Ambrose Bierce, Caitlin Kiernan, and unfortunately, this collection pales significantly in comparison; both in terms of chills and writing quality. I purchased this book based on these rave reviews, and am sorely disappointed. For readers seeking true chills, the Best New Horror collections offer much more in terms of true horror. This story collection can only hope to vaguely discomfit, if that."
3,All right,"Some of the selections in this collection are very good. Others I didn't understand at all. Overall, though, I'd say it's an all right collection and you should give it a chance."
3,Aren't horror stories supposed to be scary?,"The editors of Dark Delicacies may have intended to fashion a memorable collection of horror short fiction, but what they actually created is something less. Most of the stories are fairly slight, lacking in suspense and scariness. Two of them are just goofs or gags, Strieber's ""Kaddish"" and Holder's ""Twelve-Steppin'."" The Strieber story read much more like a political statement to me and lacked coherence and cohesiveness. The editors mixed stories by a few familiar writers with several more new names, and therein lies one of the main problems with this collection. Most of the stories by the big guns are decent enough -- in fact, the Bradbury and Campbell entries are particularly strong -- but the material by the unknowns is generally very lightweight and entirely forgettable."
4,"Some hits, some misses","This compilation from Blue Room contains great tracks and some mediocre tracks - like most techno compilations usually do.The best I think is Spectral's Avalon, which is a deep ambient groove - part Goa and part minimalist chill out. It is probably the best of that genre. Overall, its worth the used price for just that song, and all the rest is either going to be what you want or not, depending on your own personal preferences."
2,not such a humorous book,"I was expecting more laughs from this book. What a disappointment. Although there are jokes & a few funny tales, it is mostly a book about how humor can be a healthy part of healing when you are sick. I would recommend that anyone interested in this book just check it out of the library."
5,Great Book,My book group and I read this and it was great. Very good insight. A must read. I can see why it was recommended by the Library of Congress.
5,Very important book,"Quite possibly the most important book I have ever read as I do believe that this book has had a bigger impact on my life than any other. However, I am at a bit of a loss to describe it as it covers a smattering of topics from love to discipline, maturity and religion. If I could only recommend one book to you, this would be it. A MUST read."
5,Timeless Book for Integrating God Into Your Life,"This is a timeless book that every Seeker would be wise to add to their ""must read"" book list. A foundational blueprint of a book for many books later authored about God and mind. Relevant especially today in the human need to bring together spiritual growth with mental and emotional growth on the path to becoming a whole person. I highly recommend this wonderful book that unites God (or whatever you call the Divine) and the human mind.Affirmations for the Everyday Goddess Spiritual Guidebook & 22 Wisdom Cards for Contemplation & Prayer (based on the 22 major arcana of the tarot)"
3,Difficult read,Several years ago I attempted to read this book but couldn't get through it. I would love to understand why it was so difficult for me.
1,Who's Values Are These?,"What there is of value in this book was hacked at best fromEric Fromm's ""The Art of Loving."" Otherwise, this book appears to come from some sort of skewed value system where people feel it is appropriate to force their religion on others through school prayer (their style only) over loudspeakers at school and in other public places."
2,"It has good points, but the overall purpose is too religious","The points Peck makes in this book are both good and bad. I agreed with many of his assertions about discipline and love, though his definition of love is too narrow. For someone that went through medical school, he ignores many scientific principles that contracdict his assertions about science and religion. The last section of this book is evangelism, rather than persuasive writing. Overall, the overtly religious intent of this book made its argument far less effective than it could have been. If you leave off the section on grace, you have a good book.-Michael D. Herrington from Sarasota, Fl. 8/4/99check my website, aktung.homepage.com, for my full length review of this book"
2,Stop while your ahead.,"While some of his words rang true, Peck's overall upity attitude, his pretense of extravagent knowledge, and his downright maddening assuptions make me want to throw the book across the room. Unfourtunatly, I must read it for school. THe first sections were bearable, even interesting, though redundant sometimes too cynicle, and frequently too obviously praising of himself. THe second section was unbearable, the piece on science and religion and the part on grace were obviously written by anoverzealous christian who is convinced that the rest of the world, like him, must believe in God. He assumed that religion is more open minded than relgion, gave an extremely in scientific view of entropy and evolution, and presented absurd claims about how we are supposed to become god, all good things are proff of God, and that laziness is the original sin. If you must, read the first part, but while your ahead, I advise you to put the rest in the recycle bin."
5,"New Delux Edition: Now with Extra ""L""","I already own the 25th anniversary edition of this book, but man was I amazed when they published the new ""delux edition."" I had no idea that missing an extra ""L"" on the word traveled could make such a difference in the interpretation of the book. So many things make more sense to me now that they added that extra ""L."" I highly recommend the delux edition over all of the previous ""phony"" editions of this time honored classic."
4,Atheists,"What bothers me is that you are so closed minded and obviously suffer without a faith as you would not exude such negativism if you had a spiritual enlightment ; open your mind and soul, and the joys of the lord will fill you very being and you will see....."
5,This book is an instructional manual for life,"I've read this book numerous times because it contains valuable advice on succeeding in life both personally and professionally. With years of experience in psychology, Dr. Peck describes many of his patient's stories which are fascinating in themselves. But the real value is Dr. Peck's advice that he gives to avoid falling into the traps of his former patients. I would also recommend his other books as well."
3,Worth reading but some ideas that seem odd,"Over all a good book. I liked the part about overcoming difficulties as a means for achieving maturity. However, his idea that an open marriage is healthy, and that a therapist under certain circumstances could have sexual relations with a patient is somewhat disturbing. I also found that his theological ideas are somewhat biased toward evangelicalism and his theology somewhat shallow."
5,An owners manual for your mind.,"Invest in yourself and read this book, you are worth it. I promise you will not go away without having enriched your life. Stop trying to wish your problems away ...... it doesn't work...it never has....it never will."
5,Deep Reading,Put your thinking cap on as you delve into the world of spirituality. You'll discover exactly what it means to you.
3,"Perceptive, but Needs Updating","Dr. Peck is an acute observer of human nature, and backs up his case with powerful case studies. His points about love being an act of willed generosity and attention to another still resonate twenty years plus after the book's publication.That said, it could use some updating to incorporate some social changes off the last twenty years. There's a particularly discordant note struck about midway through, when, unless I'm misunderstanding something, Peck suggests that the moment ""the passive homosexual gathers the courage to ask a girl on a date"" represents some kind of courage. This is at odds with the book's message of self-acceptance, honesty and getting together the guts to live your life."
5,Only for those desperate enough to work on the hard stuff,"TRLT is not for those looking for quick and easy answers to life. Dr. Peck makes no bones that life is indeed difficult and personal growth comes by working through it's tough situations. Others may be turned off by Dr. Peck's religious beliefs, I certainly did not agree with all of them. Dr. Peck does give a methodology for integrating one's personal beliefs and/or standards with sound psychology, something I had not seen before. Keep in mind that this book was written in 1978, a first step for Dr. Peck on his own RLT. It is interesting and heartening to watch his growth in his subsequent books, which he is refreshingly candid in sharing."
3,"Great at parts, but not consistently strong","Parts of this book are simply incredible. Peck's thoughts on the role of problems, the content of genuine love, the nature of miracles and grace are truly phenonemnal. Peck is certainly a brilliant man who brings remarkable insight to the table. While this is true, parts of this book lack cogency. For example, his thoughts on the problem of evil, original sin and the religion of science are neither convincing nor compelling. Part of the problem is that he deals with these subjects in a cursory way, not giving them the attention they demand. It is as if he quickly offers his thoughts to these age-old issues as panaceas that save the day, allowing the human race to exhale a sigh of relief. I doubt that this is how Peck intended to be read, but this is my perception of these sections. Overall, this book is worth reading for the sections when Peck shines. However, be warned that there are also parts that will fail to satisfy."
5,Honesty,This book is about you/me and whether or not you want to work at being honest with your life. If you are searching for yourself and just can't seem to find where you've been hiding Dr. Peck gives you a foundation to build a positive learning environment and an eyepiece to see yourself.Definitely a library worthy read!
4,Great information,"Everyone should read this book, especially now. Many wonderful insights to help deal with frustration and disappointment and how to be balanced and happy. It may be time for us to grow up, realize that life isn't supposed to be easy but it calm still be wonderful if we accept challenges and embrace change."
5,"The Road Less Traveled, 25th Anniversary Edition : A New Psychology of Love, Traditional Values and Spiritual Growth","The Road Less Traveled, 25th Anniversary Edition: A New Psychology of Love, Traditional Values and Spiritual Growth This book can be helpful to all. It is a must read....."
5,the road less traveled,This is a great book for everyone!! Especially those who have had a hard life. I found great truths that have helped me overcome an abusive childhood.
5,By far one of the greatest books of all time.,"I keep buying this book every few years, reading it, giving it away and then buying it again.I don't consider this to be a ""self-help"" book. This book doesn't offer exercises and 10 steps you must go through to achieve x, y & z. It's a book about living, life and people. It should be re-read frequently, since, being human, we tend to forget the profound lessons that the author shares.This book is profoundly uplifting. I know people who have been deeply and profoundly changed by reading it.As many people have pointed out, Peck is a Christian. When this book was written, I believe that he was a practicing Buddhist."
1,Review Road Less Traveled,I would not buy again book was old. Pages where yellow and falling out while reading book. Very unhappy with this purchase.
1,Hit the Road Scott...,I cannot find the courage toexpress my true feelings aboutthis... uhm..... book.Squiggles
5,"The Road Less Traveled, 25th Anniversary Edition","A book in perfect order, it came so quick, I was still wondering if I should have changed my mind.But nope, it was very very interesting, and shifted me a little. Thanks, Anna"
4,Great Read.,"A patient of mine recommended this author to me. I believe that somehow, God brings you answers through people and other forms of delivery. I found within this book many answers to many questions. Questions of why I am the way I am. Where my fears, insecurities, and in some cases securities and confidence come from. I learned how childhood can make or break an individual. Most importantly, I learned that even though a person may have a hard childhood, he/she can and is very well capable of living a harmonies life. A life filled with love, serenity, joy, self confidence, and security. I learned to trust my intuition, to have self worth and most importantly to trust in God. To know that all things are possible with God. I learned that God is different for us all. To me God is Peace. May you find the answers that you are looking for in this book also."
2,frustrated-- faulty product.....,"The audio book I purchased has four cd's. Sadly, Cd one is inside the book twice and cd three is missing altogether.This was my first experience with amazon. I cannot believe this has happened. The book (after cd two) has not been listened to. Phone calls to the vendor have gone unreturned.I've no recourse. Whats a consumer to do?thanks for asking....."
1,Too Spiritual,"This book turned me away because of its ""spiritual"" content, which seems to be based on the author's view on religion. Religion and spirituality are a personal matter that cannot be easily generalized to help everyone."
5,very helpful along the road,"Few books have caught me the way this book did. Many of the other reviews you will read about this book discuss its simplicity, Christian or Puritan themes, etc. What I can say, however, is that The Road Less Travelled has a warmth, and assurance about it that makes one feel at ease with change. It provides a road map (structure) to life that really helped me tremendously. In particular, the section on religion and faith gave me new insights into spirituality. I feel much more in touch with my spirituality after reading this book. It is not a Bible, as some see it, but this book is extremely valable, and one to be treasured. Its insights are truly useful. Read, and enjoy, and read again."
4,A Very Good Book,"This book caught my attention because somehow I cross upon some people reading it, or mentioning it in delight. So I finally bought myself one.Indeed, it's a very good book. It shows how we can see things differently. Too many 'acceptable', expected norms in our lives are actually destroying our minds and souls. Only if we have the courage to defy them. Hence the LESS TRAVELED.And it explains why certain many things do not meet the eyes.. how our very subconscious manifest itself, sometimes against our conscious, in many ways.If you're looking for something to help you get a fresh, great outlook in life, consider this book. I'm glad I did. It sure enrich my mind."
5,Excellent,This book arrived in excellent condition. It was as described.The Seller sent promptly and it arrived within just a few daysof when I placed the online order!! I would order again fromthis Seller and trust their descriptions.
2,This book is almost God-awful and highly overated,"I give it two stars for the few interesting ideas presented.If you are in a emotional trouble, this hodge-podge book could make you feel worse-I know I did!Since this book was published, many good self-help/spititual growth books have been published.Do not waste your time with this book which is basically a pile of pseudo-metaphysical drivel."
3,Some Good Examples,"There is alot of technical psychological and spiritual terminology which will not keep everyone's attention. However, there are some very good examples of the powers of psychotherapy and how an open mind can help anyone. The case of Kathy is especially captivating as this situation in particular shows that healing and change takes a great amount of time and willingness to trust. There are good examples on how life events can effect one's growth. Theadore's case is another good example that illustrates that.Life is difficult where there are many trials and tribulations. People who realize this and are willing to work hard will be on the way to understanding the principles of this book better. The over reliance on psycho-terminology reduces the effectiveness but overall it has much merit."
3,Road less Traveled,Hard to get involved with it. it's very informative but written in a way that you have to look for the hidden meaning. It's not something to read unless you're very focused. Not easy reading material.
2,psycho babble,Had I known it was a psyhco babble book I wouldn't have ordered it. It goes on and on and on and on.....
3,overview of Road Less Traveled,"This book is interesting, but it takes a while to get going with it. It is not a book that is exciting from the very beginning. I would say about a third way in, it starts getting better. Although there is much knowledge in its contents, I had to force myself to keep reading in the beginning."
4,Great Book,"This is a great book, a must read for everyone! It encourages us to take action in our lives instead of just complaining about things."
3,"Half good, half not so good","I really enjoyed the first half of this book, and recommend it to anyone. The first chapters discuss the need for a person to accept responsibility for his or her situation if they are to have a healthy mental life. The next few chapters deal with love, and the differences between real, meaningful love and its false analogs such as puppy love and dependency.As the book went on, however, it grew more about spirituality, and less about psychology. While not dead-wrong in his reasonings, I do feel Peck would have been better served to stick with his strengths. The arguments in the second half of the book have been done before, and in far more convincing a manner than Peck delivers.Overall, this book is average - though the first half would rate at least four stars. If you are at all considering seeing a psychologist and want to know what you would be commiting yourself to, the investment of a few dollars and hours this book requires is well worth it."
5,"Simple, Clear, Totally accurate!","Like Peck states. There are somethings we 'know' when we hear them. his advice and insight are totally accurate! He balances all the questions and does not presume to know all the answers. His guidance, however, should lead all of us on our own paths to spiritual growth if we overcome our own laziness and perform some independent psychotherapy."
4,I read this book in 1984,"I read Peck's book in 1984 after a devastating loss of love in my life. What I remember all these years that helped me work through my feelings is 2 concepts: 1) His first sentence, which every one has mentioned that ""Life is difficult.""; and, 2)how much energy we exert by not trying to feel and that this very act of not feeling made ones emotional state more difficult and creates a barrier to healing.My interpretation of these concepts was that if I let myself feel and go through the grieving process it would actually hurt less and it would take a shorter time period to heal.I remember it was a tough book to get through; however, I clinged onto those two concepts and they really helped me heal."
4,"Just an educated opinion on life, but well worth the look.","Let me start by saying that The Road Less Traveled does not provide short cuts in the elusive road to happiness or self-satisfaction. It is a map, constructed from Peck's profesional opinions that assists in guiding those of us who are afraid to acknowledge challenge and pain. I've often found myself shut off from the world, but after reading it I came to discover that my isolation is a direct result of my choices. It gave me an outsiders perspective on the multiple excuses people make for themselves to avoid the loss of personal security.The Road Less Traveled is not for everyone, for there are portions of the book that seem misguided. Still, this is all part of the charm in Peck's philosphy on life. He isn't afraid of his imperfections, and he recognizes that in some areas his book is flawed. The Road Less Traveled is simply his educated opinion on life, nothing more, and nothing less."
4,Great Beginners Guide to Photography,A solid no nonsense guide to basic photography. This book will take you from zero to making great pictures in no time flat. I would recommend it to all beginning photographers--I only wish that it had been around when I was starting out.
4,Works on my skin,"I cannot compare this to other lotions, but I have used this lotion and use it now; it takes away my eczema; but I have to keep using it. It also takes away my mom's petickei (SP); which are blood spots just below and on the surface of the skin on her legs. Some times they actually bleed, but putting this on them every day will heal them up. But you can buy it cheaper here on amazon by looking up ""Jason Natural Products Ester-C Lotion Perfect Solutions""."
1,Too stinky to use,"I bought this at my local grocery store, excited that they were selling Jason products and having used some of their body lotions before (cocoa butter and vitamin e lotions). After using this once, I know that I will never be using it again. It smells like a very strong baby powder. My eyes are watering and the smell has not gone away 2 hours later. Unfortunately, the return policy of this company is that they won't accept anything that has been opened. There's nothing in their policy about customer satisfaction (which I am not satisfied)."
3,Ester-C,"I did not mind the scent of this lotion and I liked the way my skin looked after application. Unfortunaltely, I started to break out after using it. It may have been the level of vitamin C for me, as I have sensitive , acne prone skin. Now that I have my acne under control (no more dairy, lactose, or casein food products for me), I will try this again."
3,on the fence,"Love the container. Easy, clean pump. Love the feel of the lotion, love putting it on, and it feels great on my face. Problem 1, the smell. Lord it stinks. I've got frown lines now - it's like Pavlov's dog - everytime I reach for the bottle, I instinctively frown. Oh, it eases after aprx 30 minutes, then you can still smell it sometimes, but it's not bad then. Problem 2 - and I don't know if it's caused by the lotion yet or not - I'm 'studying' the issue - I've started getting BLACKHEADS. I've never had them before - acne oh yeah, but not blackheads. So there you have it - I've been using it for aprx 1.5 months now - like I said - feels wonderful on your face, but get a clothes pin first."
1,Not one of the best performances ever,"If you want to buy a good recording of Beatrice Di Tenda, you really musn't buy this album. The sound quality is really bad. And this isn't the complete opera of Bellini's Beatrice."
3,Excellent Performance/Poor Sound Recording,"The young June Anderson had a roaring success in Bellini's BEATRICE DI TENDA at La Fenice in Venice. That she was fully up to the title role's demands is audible in this live performance. The entire recording is, however, pitched sharp. Anderson comes across sounding like a baby duck on steroids. The rest of the cast doesn't fare too badly, but the high tessitura of her part, combined with the incorrect pitch level makes for difficult listening.This performance contains a textual variant that I have never heard in any other, a ritardando in the last few seconds of the opera, that appears NOT to just be a pitch waiver.There are notes and a plot summary, but no texts."
3,Back once again,The renegade masters remix collection is pretty good. The Fat Boy Slim remix is one of my favorites. I own it on vinyl as well and it gets a lot of turntable time.
5,World music,"Love this CD. Great for background music at parties or long road trips.Funky, jazzy, hip-hop, fun. Ethnic eclectic sound."
5,A cocktail party for the ear,"I received this CD as a gift from my younger sister&I; STILL enjoy it.It's worth every listen.This CD kicked off Putumayo's Lounge series,giving it an auspicious start.There are tracks I enjoy more than others,but it isn't a weak album;there aren't fillers.The best tracks are those by Pink Martini,Nicola Conte,Jasmon,Mo'Horizons,Gotan Project,Hamid Baroudi,Montefiori Cocktail,Arling&Cameron;,and Blue Asia.Mau Mau&Dissidenten; aren't my favorites;as you can see,99% of the CD is pure perfection.The music uses a variety of styles.Nicola Conte,Jasmon,as well as Arling&Cameron; use Bollywood as inspiration.""Shiva's Daughters"" is loveably cheesy.Hamid Baroudi&Blue; Asia make haunting Middle Eastern melodies.Mo'Horizons&Gotan; Project have more Latin flavors.Montefiori Cocktail turns a Brazilian bossa nova tune into kitschy bliss.Pink Martini from Portland,Oregon (being from Oregon,I'm proud of them)gives a nod to chanson.This CD is intoxicating;it's a musical margarita."
3,A bit annoying,"I found a lot of the tracks long and repetitive to the point of being annoying. They sound good when they start out, but get old after a while an go on much too long.I am a fan of World Music and don't mind the pop-techno oriented stuff in good measure, but there are much better discs out there than this one in my opinion.Also, what's with all the drum machines and programmed bass parts? Like there aren't any human musicians available."
4,Classy Chill,"Chill-out music is a global phenomenon and this trendy lounge music compilation by Putomayo is excellent for perfecting the act of lounging idly. Modern downtempo masters like Italian producer Nicola Conte and German DJ Project Jasmon love marrying South American elements with enigmatic middle eastern melodies to create a novel, entrancing aural backdrop for a moodsome lounge session. This eclectic collection with European DJs validates that Parisians have no monopoly over chill-out vibes. So whether you are on a warm rug at your own lounge pad or at a chic Parisian lounge, just lay back on this chill out odyssey. My faves: Mau Mau, a folksy accordion with quirky percussion, punchy bass and subtle electronic remixes and bits of African pop & Blue Asia (Japan) which fuses exotic Indian sitar with oriental trumpets.

4,Putumayo collections are always excellent!,"This one isn't going to have mass appeal however. The goal of this collection, a ""chill-out soundtrack for a global cocktail party,"" is reached, which means you've got to be young enough (or young enough at heart) to like the rave-techno-trance beat. If you don't know what I mean about trance music, well this would be a really good choice to experience it for the first time, without having to learn the ins and outs of the international trance-techno subculture (or try Kraftwerk, they may have been the first to expose Americans to this Euro-sound). The other Putumayo collections I've heard have been anthologies to feature a geographic-cultural theme. This one features techno-trance artists from all over the world, and thus it's quite post-modern and not at all regional, nor does it feature a specific ethnicity or group of related cultures. I've enjoyed this CD with martinis, and long road trips, though obviously, not at the same time."
4,Very Cute!,This is a really cute book that makes a great gift for new mommies. I've bought it for 4 friends so far and they have all loved it. It will give them a good laugh and is even cute to have out on the coffee table as a conversation piece.
3,Amusing to a point,"This is amusing to a point, and not really geared for baby. It's references are British, not American, so the stores other than Prada, Gucci, etc are in London. Better for Mommy than for Baby."
3,Mediocre,I thought it would be cute to have around b/c its a different take on classic nursery rhymes. I also thought the book would be more suitabe for children for some reason...but it was a bit materialistic for my tastes and not what I want my child focused on.
4,Perfect for your little fashionista.,"Hilarious! This book offers a ""fabulous"" twist on some old nursery rhymes. A very cute book for your girliest girl."
3,NOT a kids book,"This is for an adult to give to another adult as a fun joke, it's not for reading to a baby or toddler. Rhymes are weird, and loaded with designer names which a child couldn't pronounce or understand, and the print is tiny. Pictures are like designer water color drafts. I'm giving to my shoe- obsessed grammy or mailing to my fashion-forward brother. They would get a kick out of this. Don't give as a baby shower gift unless you understand this isn't to share with baby. Also fyi it is British humor/lingo."
1,shoes,I have been dissapointed in the place I was sent to order these shoes from did not get them and have not been able tofind what happened to the order.
1,"NOT sugar free, terrible taste and texture","These taste horrible and are extremely hard. My kids have been gluten free for over 4 years now, so they are not used to the 'typical' gluten containing foods at all, yet they still hated these.They are not sugar free either, they contain corn syrup. I think saying they are sugarfree is very deceiving."
4,Finishing Touch,These shower hooks put the finishing touch to the shower curtain I purchased. The only issue I have is the first hook pops off the shower rod when we move the curtain.
3,The Quintet,"This is a story of a meeting that took place, but actually could not. It is about 5 people who met for diner who talk about the topic of Artificial intelligence. Throughout this meeting, the 5 intellects argue over what would occur if machines really could think on their own. The book takes you into the beginning of the Computer Science era. It speaks of algorithms. Overall, the book is about the artificial intelligence and what is to come if it is to become a realityThe reading is alittle sluggish at times, but interesting to those who are fascinated with things ilke this."
2,could be summarized in a chapter.,"This venture into the murky waters of historical speculation and machine-consciousness debates does tell you a few things if you are unfamiliar with Turing and Wittgenstein (otherwise, don't bother reading it). But while Turing's viewpoint is clearly stated from the start, Wittgenstein's is only done justice at the end. The other three characters in the book could be merged into a single one without any loss, and in general the entire book's message could be condensed in a few pages. Which would be pages worth reading if you like articles in easy-reading popular science magazines (which I have nothing against, and indeed subscribe to)."
5,The Amazing typo Mike Spilligan,"For years I have been gathering Spike and Goon mp3s from around the intertubes. This release though cleans up a lot of the muddy murky direct from vinyl tracks in my collection. Never have the grunts and side talk been so clear. jokes once burried in the mix pop up top , weird dubbed over tracks finally are able to be heard in all their glory. It was if a large pack of elephants had stuffed my ears with cotton and now they are picked clean by several cotton gnomes.The inclusion of the Ning Nang Nong song was the deal clincher for me. This one song sent me on a quest to experience as much of Spikes works as I could. Downloaded and much loved. Join us shall you."
4,Soul Sex: Sacred Erotica.,"Soul Sex is a fictional and fantastical story about the Natural Erotic Woman. Pavitra takes one on a journey of passion and titillation that is free from practicalities, responsibilities, urban realities and the rigid protocol that strangle Man/Woman relations today in Anglo-Christian parts of the world.How sweet it is to be free to savor our natural sexual self and experience pure Love and Appreciation for the Sacred Man. This is, refreshingly, not a story where Woman becomes the hunter - masculine and aggressive - but responsive, receiving, feminine and delicious. He is not trying to take anything from Her and She needs not guard Herself fiercely because - by Pavitra's account - Trust is implicit.Thanks Pavitra. More Women's Erotica Pleeeeeeeease."
5,"A great, erotic adventure for all open-minded people!","I was captured from the first phrase and then had a hard time putting Soul Sex down. Pavitra, who is a beautiful free spirt, guides you on her lusty tale of adventure and self-awareness. It's the kind of adventure that every one of should have the opportunity to experience."
2,A major disappointment,"With Kingsley, Caine, and British comedy, I figured this movie was a sure bet. It turned out to be the only movie I've ever seen that Caine's acting wasn't able to pull out of mediocrity. I may have unconsciously expected another ""Murder by Decree"". . ."
2,Unfunny,"The problem here is that the script is simply unamusing. Despite the fine costuming and acting, the director could only do so much with witless dialog. This is a major disappointment for those seeking comedy and an offense to all serious Sherlock Holmes fans."
2,"the actors are really, the movie itn's","It funny but not really good. The actors are good,the story sucks"
4,"Funny, enjoyable, however a little too much sound effects sometimes.","Good show, enjoyable, made me laugh. Had Dickensonian tragic humor as well.The acting of Micheal Caine was great, even better than Ben Kingsley.Cheers."
4,"""the crime-doctor!""","I am a Holmes fanatic, and pretty much a purist as well. But I totally enjoyed this movie. The characters are completely sincere in their outrageous portrayals, and so funny! (Ben Kingsley isan excellent comedian - who knew???) The case is also a pretty good one, and the immediate dangers to the characters are also real, even if hysterical. There are little bits of business throughout that show in very few words different aspects about the characters and their relationships. I could say ""I loved the part where..."" over and over again. But you just buy the thing and find your own bits to love."
4,AFUN - DIFFERENT TAKE ON SHERLOCK HOLMES,"The ""without a Clue"" dvd is a fun film Michael Caine and Ben Kingsley are an odd but comical team and I'm glad to add it to my dvd collection. It arrived in great time, and condition and I got it for a great price. I'm very satisfied. Thank you."
4,Without a Clue,This movie was hilarious as a spoof on Sherlock Holmes. It stuck to the main characters but changed Holmes from being the mystery solver to Watson. Michael Caine was great at portraying the idiot Holmes. It brings a lighter version to the everyday Holmes and wish they had made more this way.
4,Marvellous,"The whole concept of Dr Watson being the brains behind the outfit & Sherlock Holmes purely the front man & in this case a poor actor is brilliant. The story, acting & direction are so enjoyable & make superb entertainment. Michael Caine is amazing as the hapless, dim witted, woman chasing Sherlock Holmes while Ben Kingsley is wonderful as the frustrated and ignored brilliant sleuth. The real genius, going unoticed & totally overlooked.A marvellous and engrossing ""ride"" for all the lovers of baffling Holmes style mysteries. A pure gem and totally hilarious. Not to be missed."
4,The Real Story Behind Sherlock Holmes,"Very funny movie about the real brains behind Sherlock Holmes. If Holmes is the drunken, clueless numbskull he seems to be, who does all the detective work, and who solves all those crimes? Very entertaining, especially for fans of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's character."
5,Great fun!,"This movie is a terrific spoof of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's characters. ""Holmes"" is actually an idiot actor hired by Watson to play the famous detective. The laughs just keep coming as the movie proceeds and never let up."
4,7 yr old LOVES it!,"My sis-in-law gave my 7 yr old daughter the Polly Pockets School Backpack for her b'day. This is something I would not have purchased for her due to all of the small pieces. But amazingly enough, it's a pretty cool toy. We try to keep everything stored in the backpack, which my daughter takes in the car with her -- she loves to play with this toy. The dolls are ideal for the tub, too. The clothes can be a little difficult to manuever at 1st, but eventually the kids get the hang of it. We have bought Polly Pockets for all of my daughter's friends b'days because they all love to play with them at our house."
5,Great Toy For All,"Once I got this toy it was the best thing ever, I played with it nonstop! The thing is younger children may not like it because clothes are small. Polly Pockets are like barbies for 1 reason. After you play with them nonstop for a couple days, you get tired of them. It happened to me, so I took a break and played again! It's a must buy!"
4,Surprisingly fun,"My 4 year old got this for her birthday. I wouldn't have picked it but she really likes it. She spent at least an hour with it the day she opened it. I was amazed. I just wish they had put a clasp on the box so it's easier to open. It's not just impossible for her to open, I've broken a nail on it myself. A simple raised button on one side or the other would have helped!"
5,Excellent toys,"I highly recommend Polly Pocket toys, for the correct age group. My daughter is now 10 and has played with polly, both big and small, since she was 5. She still has her original Polly compact which has survived countless play dates and car trips. To the woman who complained about things falling apart--two is too young. First of all, the smallest items can be put in a two-year-old's mouth. There are age ranges listed for a reason. My daughter may be getting away from some of her toys now, but Polly is still tops of her Christmas list this year."
1,Mom of 5 year old and 7 year old Girls.,My 5 year old found this toy hard to play with because of all the tiny peices. The hangers were hard to hang and most of the peices were lost by the end of the day. My 7 year old found it too small to enjoy it keep her interest for very little time. She found Polly was not as fun to dress as her large dolls she got. I even got frusterated with it because when I went to pack it up many of the peices scattered all over the place.
2,"EASILY BROKEN, DIFFICULT TO DRESS","I bought this for my 2 yr old daughter thinking what a great toy for places where you have to ""wait"". Well, she had it 24 hours when in the midst of my putting her pants on, the doll fell apart. My daughter was very upset about it. I know she is a bit young for the doll, but she is careful with her things and most particular about keeping pieces together. Would have been an excelent purchase if it were more durable."
1,Poor Performance,"I'm getting very poor performance when I plug these units into outlets in different rooms (presumably on different circuits).In the same room, the Configuration Utility shows throughput of 14 Mbps. In different rooms, it shows 0.9 Mbps.These results render this product useless. To make matters worse, the SMC e-mail support has been unresponsive.If you buy this, make sure you can return it if you get lousy results."
1,Total Junk,"This product was hollow, which was not clearly specified in the item description. It was not what I was expecting and seemed to be poor quality. I returned the item."
5,"Energetic, moving jazz","This is another fine disc from Ken VanderMark and his bandmates. I saw Ken at a local, independent music store a couple years ago, just playing his bass clarinet for the customers. He was in town for a show that night, and he has played here a couple of times. A few weeks ago I was at a local deli, when I saw Ken in line and recognized him. He and his band were on the way to Canada for a show. Stuff like Ken does is keeeping jazz alive and bringing it to a newer audience as well. The younger people should check it out, it has the energy they like, yet is not simple-minded nor does it wear out like pop music."
4,"Nice, but not really for adults","Maybe I should have realized from the 18"" chain that this was only for kids, but the chain's length is not a problem for me. On the other hand, the clasp is extremely small (roughly 1/4""), making it difficult to take the item on and off.I like the crucifix, but I wish the clasp had been designed for adult fingers."
5,Best Screwdriver set I've owned!,"I immediately had to use the biggest screwdriver in the set to do work on the car. Being magnetized and having a hex nut bolster for wrench-assisted torque made my job much easier than with any other screwdriver I've got. Now, the problem will be trying to keep track of them and not loaning any out."
4,I bought these for ME,"Lots of grousing in our house about never being able to find a screwdriver. I get accused of losing tools, although I was putting the two go-to ones back in their place every time I used them.So I bought this set to be my own. I'm going to keep it in my closet. It was an inexpensive set, and the reviews of it were good, so it's a small price to pay for peace.The grips are comfortable, if not entirely smooth. They do have seams. These seem to be strong and well made. For household purposes, I think you can't go wrong with them."
5,SCREWDRIVERS -,"I HAVE A SET MYSELF, VERY WELL MADE, SO I GAVE IT AS A GIFT TO MY DAUGHTER ... SHE LOVED IT!GREAT PRICE -- AND SURPRISINGLY STRONG. FULLY RECOMMEND ... AND IF YOU LOSE ONE PIECE..IT IS NO GREAT LOSS AT THAT PRICE."
1,made in crapville,designed to use a wrench at top but who fit proper made tools so just another screwdriver and crappie at that.. I'LL NEVER BUT tekon PRODUSTS AGAIN.
3,ok for the price,"cheep screw drivers , handles are cheep plastic but cant complain too much for the price . If your looking for a well made set then look else where , but a ok for just basic set. their ok"
3,Decent tool for the money,"Exactly what I expected for this kind of price point. These can be used for most simple household tasks. Not a ""professional tool"" by any sense of the word, but in candor, the closest you can come for this price point. Only gave 3 stars, because three stars is ""it's okay"" ... well that what these are. I am satisfied with what I got."
4,Good Set of Screwdrivers.,"For some reason, i don't think a fella could ever have enough tools. Have some in my garage, in my work shop, in my truck and in my tractor, but never where i need them.so, i thought i just buy a cheap set and hope they will last me a couple of years, but i was and still am impressed how good they seem to be. i would definitely suggest this set (more straight than phillips though in this set.)"
4,Supertramp in the heart.,"Slow Motion is a sophisticated jazzy, light-funk-infected pop album, released by the same group 20 years + after Crime of the Century and Breakfast in America.All the songs on this album are Supertramp songs in the heart; and If you are a Supertramp fan, you will find this album a real Jewel.Recommended; specially for all the old fans of this group."
3,Supertramp without....,"Roger Hodgson (Vocal, Guitar) will never be the same band. But this (the bands 4th studio effort without Hodgson)is an improvement over the last studio efforts. Basically if your a fan of Rick Davies style with Supertramp then you'll buy it. The title track is the best of the bunch. Rick showing his love for the bluesy/jazzy songwriting he has stamped into the Supertramp sound. But yes Roger come back. The chemistry between Rick and Roger made those albums. Start with Breakfast in America or a compilation of hits."
1,Disappointment,"It is a real shame that Supertramp just plays long drawn out Jazz. I am sorry to upset anyone, but Roger Hodgson was Supertramp and without him, the band goes nowhere. This album, like Some Things Never Change, is a disappointment. On tour, Rick still has to stoop to use Roger's songs.......nuff said.Do yourself a favor and buy Open The Door."
1,Waste of time....,If Supertramp wanted to go in such a new direction they should have taken a new band name. Get HAI HAI from Roger Hodgson before this lammo!!!
3,"NO ROGER HODGSON "" NO SUPERTRAMP""","This CD is missing the elements of sweetnes and melodies, the kind that only Roger Hodgson produces....Davies is foolish for not getting together with Roger and pulling together...the chemistry was so great along with the other original members, however I give this 3 STARS for Davies efforts. The magical minstral man Roger was such a strong predominant force. Maybe, just one day it will happen."
4,Slow Motion has Devotion!,"This CD has some great sounds. I miss Roger, but he's making good sounds of his own. Supertramp has made some good music and it's nice to know they still can. To Rick & Company--keep it up we still love your tunes!"
3,3 tramps...3 stars,"Nice tones. Good music. highlights are davie's on the keys. and Helliwells sax. Rick, John, and Bobs' sidemen are great musicians. the longer songs are jams. tramp fans will enjoy parts."
1,"My God, What is these?","What is these, music? Where is the band that I love. I remeber it's name was Supertramp, but these is another one, somebody is fooling me.I bought these album thinking I was going to have a new great album of Supertramp and I found these ""boring thing"", with a music that maybe if the Label said something different than Supertramp I'll found it better, but what is inside these album are just bad words to the name Supertramp means in music.Next time I bought an album only for the name of the band I'll check it first.Maybe I'm to tuff, but I love Supertramp music, and these is something totally different,STAY AWAY FROM IT"
1,Please No More,"I've been a Supertramp fan since 1979 when the Breakfast in America album gets to my heart. Then the rest is just history; they became my favorite band (Still they are).But when Roger left the band, that magic flew with him and the band turns into a different one, with some good stuff but loosing the magic and the quality they had.I get the ""Slow Motion"" album and again is the same old story, but these time in a very bad way. Please don't loose your money with these album, is really bad and shows that Mr. Davis is far away from the one we all like. His music have nothing new to tell, there is no surprise in these work, or just a recall of those good old days of the band.Plese Mr. Davis keep the story just how it is and stop giving us these sort of music.A VERY BAD ALBUM, SAVE YOUR MONEY, DON'T BUY IT."
1,THESE SMELLS REALLY BAD,"These is the worst cd I ever bought in my life and I have more than 500.Mr. Davies, what are you doing? Is these music? or just playing some stupid sort of. Where are those great compositions you made in the past? Don't tell me that you without Mr. Hodgson are nothing less than a MEDIOCRE piano player with a MEDIOCRE voice.Try more your self and bring us something that we can call good music (great music came from great musicians and you're not one of those, belive me).Boy, for these days the only guys that are doing good music are the Classical Rock composers, (here one is dead)I DEMAND AN EXPLANATION AND MY MONEY BACK, THESE REALLY SMELL LIKE A DEAD BODY."
4,A summers groovy pop affair,"A great album of groovy sounds and syrupy melodic pop. Jason and Sara have produced the ideal album to relax to on a summers day. Including the uplifting sound of ""That summer feeling"" to the tongue in cheek ""Mmm Delicious"" and closing with the enchanting strains of ""Dreaming""."
3,in the mood for lounge-pop?,"I was a bit disappointed with this album after hearing their song from the Moshi Moshi compilation. For the most part, this album isn't as upbeat as 'Everybody Knows'. And I hate to admit it, but I found the vocals quite bad, offkey. But yes, it is very loungy sort of in a jarvis cocker/momus way."
5,Good Good !!,"If you are a John Coltrane fan, this is an essential, and what makes this cd extra smooth is it is using ""gold"" cd, believe me it makes a difference, pick this one up as soon as you can!"
4,Very Good Album,I respectfully disagree with the previous reviewer.This is a very solid album by Screamin' Jay Hawkins.I definitely recommend it for all Screamin' fans and collectors.
5,A timeless performance by Southside Johnny,"I recently discovered this DVD from one of my all-time favorite singers, Southside Johnny, captured live with his band, The Asbury Jukes, on some sort of German program from 1992. Southside Johnny is in his usual top form and The Jukes sound great as well. Just don't be distracted by the appearance of some of the band members who look more like escapees from a late 80's - early 90's L.A. hair band than the tight R&B band that they are."
4,Love reading about people who take books so seriously...,"This was the first ""fantasy"" book I've read in a long time. I usually have a ""quick"" brain, but I admit I did have to go back and re-read passages in this book to make sure I had all the facts. What really made me love this book was total immersion in reading and literature. I could never have imagined a world where people take books so seriously, and I love that! Book lovers will love The Eyre Affair for that fact alone. I immediately wishlisted all of Jasper Fforde's other works so that I can continue to be immersed in a world where everyone is as crazy about books as I am! Hope his other books don't disappoint."
5,What a delight,"So what a pleasant surprise. This book was an impulse buy for vacation based upon the blend of styles and plot lines offered in the description. I was curious to see if the author could pull it off. And did it ever work.In a nutshell Thursday Next is a Literary Police Officer in England making sure the literary classics maintain their integrity in history. There is magic, comedy, disbelief and fun. The characters are great and most interestingly, in their literary world, quite believable. Those of you that lack a sense of humor or have a literal aura about them probably should move on to some non-fiction, but if you want a well written book that is a fun read, order away."
4,Held my attention from the first page,"Really enjoyed The Eyre Affair. It held my interest right from the first page, something which is really rare. It put me in mind of Orwell's 1984, only not quite as hopeless. Love the way Fforde has created an alternate universe in which literature is taken very seriously. Any language or lit fan will get a huge kick out of this book. A couple minuses-- I think Thursday talks and thinks like a man, which seems to improve a bit in future books. Also, this book really has everything except heart. No real emotional involvement. But Fforde makes up for that in Book 2. That's why I give this book a 4 out of 5."
5,Fantastic Series,"Amazing writing, amazing creativity. Think of Harry Potter for literary adults. It's a fantastic peice of fiction."
4,Jane Eyre with a twist,"Imagine a world where, instead of sports and movie stars, Shakespeare is IT. Dickens is the thing. Christopher Marlowe has practically his own cult, complete with door to door ""salesmen.""where people travel by dirgible, and participate in Richard the III like they do with Rocky Horror. Time is all an iffy thing, too. Barely explainable and understandable, especially in this book. Then add Agent Tuesday on top---its a pretty interesting fantasy scenario. Not a grabber, but keeps us going along.The Jane Eyre part was pretty interesting, and there was a subtle humor to the story. I still would've liked to know, then, if Hades couldn't die with bullets, ...Recommended."
5,"Original, witty and compelling","This book is a delightful read. I was both intrigued and doubtful about the premise. When I try to tell others about it they say, ""Hmmmm.""But Fforde pulled it off. He takes a wild premise and runs with it in such a way that you are [taken] in, giggling and shaking your head all the way. It's not often that books have me howling out loud. The last one that did that to me was ""Me Talk Pretty One day"" by David Sedaris.Much to the dismay of those who have to live with me, Fforde managed to have me cackling like a madwoman.I finished the book last night, laughing too loudly into the wee hours.I would definitely recommend this title. If you doubts, set them aside and give this book a chance."
3,A little strange,"Mildly amusing, enjoyed the literary references. Author used a clever device for the plot."
4,A Lot of Fun!,More fun and interesting than most light novels for adults. I am completely hooked on Fforde's alternate reality.
3,Well Writen but not my taste,"I read this book on the recommendation of my sister. I found it to be well writen. The author was certainly creative, and is worthy of respect. But if you have never read Jane Eyre, and don't care for Dickens then you, like me may not actually enjoy the book all that much. In short the villan in the book is damaging or destroying many of the books your teacher forced you to read against your will in school, and as such it is very difficult if you don't have fond memories of these books to side with Hero, and will enjoy all the subplots more than the main plot."
4,The adult Harry Potter book,"Just finished reading The Eyre Affair, it was a very enjoyable book, the perfect light, entertaining and fast read for a short getaway. Kind of like an ""adult Harry Potter book"". I enjoyed it very much, Fforde had many interesting and extraordinary ideas, the book is full of incredibly original creations and expressions, I think I'll check out the next books in the series."
4,Sci-fi for English nerds,"A wonderfully clever novel -- this is definitely something any lit-nerd out there should look into! Though I think Fforde could use some work on his pacing, ultimately his plot was inventive, funny and exciting and the world that he writes is extremely well-created. Thursday is engaging, and not too feminine-- male readers could also relate well to her, I'm assuming. I'm looking forward to picking up the next one in the series!Read my full review of this novel and others at: [...]"
4,A good start...,"I'd missed the first book in the Thursday Next series, so I thought I'd look back to see how it all started just to see if Fforde's work was always the hodgepodge of time travel, book travel and random bits of soap opera that the other books have proven to be. I found the introduction to the world of Spec. Ops to be a bit more linear and cohesive at the start. Thursday's ""sad sack"" demeanor is in clear evidence but the novel is much more plot driven and works a bit better than some of the later material. All the characters are in place and Hades never seems to be quite as menacing as he is in his first appearance. You soon realize that with time being so fluid in these storylines that Fforde always has an escape route if he wants to use it if the story gets too dark. This series was off to a good start in the opener and even though I have found the novels to get a bit sillier as time goes on, but they are generally funny enough to deserve a quick read."
4,Liked it,"I liked the book because it was science fiction, provided ample thought food and presented parallel universes while being at the same time humorous.I especially liked the dodo. He was my favorite character."
5,Great Book,"Okay so the books a little odd and the names are silly but aside from that it an intresting and original premise, something that fiction authors seem to be finding increasingl hard to find. The book is the story of thursday next who lives in an slternet reality where books are cherised is fun and intresting.In this book time travle is possile and highly regulated by the government. Thusday is one of the many goverment emloys who whatchs over the world of books and ensures nothing is changed from the original story. In this book the original manuscript Jane Eyre (amoung other things) is stolen and Thursday embarks a jouerny to save her Aunt, Uncle, and her favorite book."
3,"It starts out wonderfully, but...","This book has some truly intriguing ideas in it, as well as some great humor, but the character development is nil. About one third of the way through the book, I began to feel as though I were watching a television program --something along the line of The Avengers (which I loved)-- and that feeling stayed with me right through to the end. It was entertaining, but ultimately unsatisfying."
1,Weird,"This book is just too weird, too descriptive with uninteresting wordiness, too bizaar for my taste, too far-fetched. I like a credible tale. This book has NO credibility, whatsoever!"
3,I wanted so desperately to love this book.........,"but it simply isn't for me. I read half of both this book and Lost in a Good Book, and was completely disinterested in finishing. There is no ""whodunit"" to keep you guessing, and no character of sufficient interest. If you require an engaging character (and I do), this series may not be for you.I was drawn to the premise. The books are well-written. I appreciate the artistry. It's a good story. I'm all for word painting and suspension of belief in the right context, and Fforde does that beautifully, but I think this series is thin on character development. I realize, of course, that character development is not what this series is all about, and that it isn't important to a lot of people. If this doesn't bother you, then you will like these books.I, however, need a character. If I don't know the characters, I simply don't care what happens in the story. And I didn't."
2,Creative idea; inept execution,"I love mysteries and crime fiction and geniuses policing good and evil while abandoning the morality taught by half-wit parents, clergy, teachers, politicians and news programs. I love the surreal premise of the lines between life and fiction, between the past and the present, between reality and fantasy blurring. Blurring them all at once is ambitious. Doing so with flat characters, predictable twists, and such a complete abandonment of reality makes for a boring book. You can't get caught up in the characters when they are so trite. You can't get to the edge of your seat when people might become invisible, some characters are impervious to bullets, and good and bad sit so clearly opposed to each other. Dragsville."
3,An intriguing concept,"The idea is very creative and the plot well thought out. I love the idea of characters slipping between the fictional literary world and the one we call ""real"".Like most books, I find the ending a bit weak. Frequently authors leave one with the feeling that this thought occurred to them, ""I must finish the book now - how?""It is not necessary to tie up all the loose ends in the last chapter or two. Leaving something to the imagination of the reader is preferable as it has the advantage of letting the book ""linger for a while"" after the covers have been closed."
4,"Creative, fun read!","This is a book you have to read...not just listen to or you miss some of the author's creativity with the ""book worms""! It's helpful to be familiar with Jane Eyre but not totally necessary. I'm sure I missed quite a few laughs because it has been so long since I'd read Jane Eyre that I missed the connections. I can't wait to read the next book in the series."
3,"Fun, but too silly for me","I was looking forward to a book with a tough heroine and a literary tie in. In the end it was a fun, quick read, but I never got into Thursday's own love story, and I suspect I'm too American to appreciate the humor, which could be pretty silly. Still, it got me to download Jane Eyre on Kindle so I could reread it."
3,It was OK.,"The protagonist felt kind of cold. Perry Mason that's a girl but felt more like a guy. I'm not so sure in this instance that a male author should write in the first person for a female character at this length. With that social blunder said, it may be fine as there are more than likely many books that I've read that I never noticed the difference or even thought to ask but in this one I did. I liked the plot and it had some good humor along the way but it felt a bit like a tommy gun."
3,Hmmm... Very strange indeed,"I read this book because it was selected by my book group. It is not the kind of book I would normally read, but I forced myself to finish it anyway. Very strange indeed... If you like literature, suspension of disbelief and cops/robbers stories you will love this book."
2,Doesn't Bear Thought,"Fluff. One or two cute ideas bogged down in an inconsistent effort to be whimsical. As you look at reviews for later Fforde books, keep in mind that it's only the people who liked the early ones that are reading the later ones, so the attitudes of the readers tend to be more favorable and the rating results skewed upwards..."
3,entertaining,"Many aspects of this book were great--creative and original, brilliant fantasy...it was Fforde's real-world character developments that I did not really care for. entertaining but sometimes annoying"
2,Couldn't Finish It,"I was excited to read this book. It sounded imaginative, fun and different; especially when somebody compared this to the works of the late Douglas Adams. Instead, it was just boring. I read about half this book and it just did not grab me. No, I'm sorry, not at all. I've since decided to move on to something different."
2,Barfable - Save your brain the pain of reading this book,"I was deeply disappointed with this book. I do *not* understand how books like this become best sellers. It occurred to me as bad children's literature - the characters are stiff, boring and unlikable. While I like the premise, the writing is choppy and shallow. The book has a major non-sequitor - at one point, the main character travels forward in time 36 years, but all the supporting characters don't age in those 36 years. Huh? Also, one unlikable character is named Schitt - a very immature play on the poo word. Give me a break - are we still in grammar school? Read the ""Number One Detective Agency"" books instead."
5,Imagination Plus,Jasper Fforde takes us to a new world that bridges fiction and reality as we know it. Bibliophiles will love the humor. The literary references are a treat. But far from being dry it is an action-packed crime story with a cast of colorful villains for our Thursday to sleuth out and battle. Time travel as a criminal method is not a new idea but Mr. Fforde uses with a twist.
5,"Fun, smart and elegantly witty","In the world of Thursday Next (a Special Ops agent), literature (and art) is taken very seriously: the door-to-door proselytizers want to change your literary beliefs, not your religious ones. Opposing artistic interpretations causes rioting in the streets. And Richard III is in long run with audience participation a la ""Rocky Horror Picture Show."" It's not necessary to be an English Lit major to enjoy this book, but it sure is a treat for us.It's funny, it's outlandish (literally and figuratively), and the writing is very sharp. And the spirit of Dickens hovers over the names: Archeron Hades (and his brother, Styx), Filbert Snood, and the whole Next family (including Mycroft, Joffy and Anton). This book is just a sheer delight."
4,Fun Read,"If you love words you will love this book. It's full of word play and literature puns while at the same time telling an exciting detective story with a futuristic twist. If you're not very well read you may miss a few of the puns, but you'll probably still enjoy the nice writing."
4,Loved it!,"The Eyre Affair takes place in 1985 in London, but not the 1985 we remember. This 1985 includes time travel, literary detectives, and a corporation that pretty much runs everything including the news media. The book follows LiteraTec Thursday Next as she tries to save some of our most notable literary treasures from the villainous Acheron Hades.I loved this book. I loved the quirky characters. I loved the clever word play and the witty one liners. Oh, and I would love to be able to travel into some of my favorite books like the characters in this one did. This just barely missed a five star rating from me. It's seriously only thousandths away. I don't want to spoil anything so I'll just say the romantic story line is the only reason I didn't give this five stars. The outcome of that situation just didn't feel right to me. Otherwise, I think this is a fantastic, very original story and I will definitely continue the series."
3,travelthru & unravel time,"This reminds me a bit of an Artemis Fowl book only with curse words. There is some clever word play and humorous moments, however, the story did not hold my attention very well. The constant time travel back and forth made it seem like a never ending journey to the inevitable non-ending cliffhanger."
3,A Weekend Book,The Eyre Affair is definetly a fun book to read. It is slow moving in the beginning but by page 100 I was hooked into it. This fantasy takes place in England in the 1980s. It's not the England we know but one where the Crimean War is still raging and literary and art police are present. The Eyre Affair is both a fantasy and a science fiction novel. Time travel is present and there is a machine which enables people to enter into novels. This book is funny at times . It's a good rainy day book.
5,"Enchanting, fun, and it will send you back to Jane Eyre.","Thursday Next is a wonderful heroine, and her strange family adds to the entertainment. Even if you don't ordinarily enjoy alternative histories, you may like this one. A little science fiction, a little mystery, and lots of humor. By the time I'd finished reading it, I simply had to dig out Jane Eyre for another reading. I'm back for a second round, having just finished the second book in the series--which was great fun as well."
2,"superficial, tedious string of clichés","The premise is interesting and one prepares for a few good jokes, at least. Instead one gets an utterly flat succession of British detective-fiction clichés, narrated without zest or originality and accompanied by some capricious nonsense that is supposed to pass for ""imaginativeness""."
4,Hilariously funny!?,"Not really. But amusing. Can't imagine slogging through all installments of the Thursday Next opus ('clever device', though clever enough, seems rather one-trick-poneyish). TEAATNN made for a quick and pleasurable afternoon's reading. One afternoon will suffice though."
3,whimsical,"This is the first book in a series whose heroine is Thursday Next, and her name embodies the British humor that pervades the book. This book wasn't exactly my thing, but the literary references were a hoot. I especially enjoyed the various arguments about who really wrote Shakespeare's plays."
5,Hold On For A Wild Ride,"I was wary about this book when it was chosen in my book club. It sounded so strange - and is, face it, just about impossible to describe except with the trite saying 'the author creates an alternative universe.'It is engaging, smart - a wild ride. I liked Thursday immensely, and saw the irony of a world where this is only one religion (which everyone belongs to) so people fight instead about literature. A reality where one can climb in and out of books, and back and forth in time. Very clever - an amazing achievement for a first-time novelist.I've read a couple of the sequels and they mostly hold up to the first, with interesting new parts of the 'alternative universe' developed. I highly recommend them all."
5,do not miss this one,"Buy this book, read it and ... get the second installment, Lost in a Good Book....you won't be sorry. Thursday is a wonderful character, who knows even more wonderful characters."
1,The price is OUTRAGEOUS!,"I was hoping to get this book for my Kindle, but when I discovered that I could get the ""dead tree"" edition for less... This is insane."
1,Oh dear lord!,"This might possibly be the worst book I have ever read. It strains to be deep and engaging, but is simply unengaging and predictable. The consistant use of puns just makes is worse. Stay away."
3,"Great idea, too focused on plot.","Wonderful story and utterly imaginative. But I wouldn't have minded more characterization and less focus on moving along the plot. Fforde's ideas are so original and impressive that I wanted time to take all of it in, to really explore the alternate world he creates. I wanted to get to know the characters and the landscape initmately, rather than know just enough information to keep the story going. I found this difficult to do, since ideas were thrown out quickly in order to keep the plot progressing. ""The Eyre Affair"" is original and intriguing - I wanted even more than what Fforde allowed me to see."
1,Splat,"I really wanted to like this book. I love Harry Potter, I love Douglas Adams. I bought this and expected to get it home and devour it. Instead, I could barely bring myself to finish it. I have nothing against cleverly constructed alternate realities, but this was instead an alternate reality of pure cleverness, awash in puns and ""highbrow"" literary references that made me feel like I was being sassed at by a smart-alecky pre-teen bookworm. The writing was flat and trite, suited more to internet fanfic than a published novel. The characters were transparent, existing as not much more than stock caricatures with clever names and added, apparently, as needed, with no life of their own. Thursday Next herself failed to materialize at all. My advice: save yourself the crushing disappointment and don't even read the tantalizing book jacket - just pass this by and read, well, anything else."
4,Lots of fun -,Fforde has done a great job inventing a new alternate world. So much fun reading about a world where the book-loving people make up the majority. I thoroughly enjoyed it & the references to classics - and the story of Jane Eyre's previous ending!
1,Oh Dear.,"I bought this book on the strength of the many-starred reviews on it's cover; reviews from the NY review of Books, the Washington post, et al.I'm still waiting for the 'verve', 'quirky charm' and 'clever wordplay' to emerge. Admittedly, the premise is clever; the alternate universe with details such as the Hyperbookworms, ChronoGuards and the biblio-centric society well thought out, but the prose is pedestrian in the extreme (as one other reviewer wrote, it's of the 'I did this, the he did that.....' style). And the witty word play? A character named Jack Schitt? Not funny the first time, and after the two-hundredth mention of Mr. Schitt, I felt like screaming. (I did giggle at a few of the names though, like 'Millon De Floss', but it's hardly subtle is it?)So, excellent ideas, shame about the writing. I should mention that I did finish it - and will probably take the rest of the series out on loan from the library."
2,There are some good story ideas in here...,"If you are that person out there who's read a thousand character driven classics, but has a secret love for plot driven books, this book was made for you.I liked the time travel gags, and enjoyed the field trips into _Jane Eyre_ (who wouldn't?).I'm still shaking my head at the parallels between Thursday's life and Jane's, which added nothing of substance to either story. The surprising part is that you can take an independent woman who's been betrayed by one man and is invited to go on a mission with another and make her resemble Jane Eyre so LITTLE.It wouldn't be so bad if the author didn't remind you in every third sentence how well read he is. I got the in-jokes, and they added nothing to the story either. I don't mind congratulating myself for having read Shakespeare, but I want to feel MORE than just smug."
3,Bedazzle,"Thursday Next is a Special Operative in literary detection in an England of 1985 where time travel is routine for some and altering literature is a serious offense. A man from Thursday's past named Acheron Hades is quickly gaining attention for his heinous crimes, especially after he steals the original manuscript for ""Martin Chuzzlewit"". Thursday's uncle has created a machine through which one can enter books, and Hades has kidnapped him. After killing off a minor character in the book, Next and her fellow operatives know Hades means business, and when he next steals the original ""Jane Eyre"", Thursday takes it personally because it's her favorite book. In this wildly imaginative thriller, Jasper Fforde keeps readers dazzled with his quirky tale that references pop culture, literary classics, and historical alternatives. ""The Eyre Affair"" is a witty book that will delight many bibliophiles and will leave many heads spinning."
5,Awesome,"I love Jasper Fforde's books! He is a great author, with loads of imagination, and brings you on a fun ride!Once you read the first you will want to follow the whole series!"
3,'s all right...,"This was recommended to me by a bunch of people, but I honestly don't understand why. It was all right. That's about it. Seriously cool premise, pretty good world-building...and then incredibly flat characters combined with what just isn't very good writing. That said, I still read all four of them and enjoyed them in much the same way that I enjoy Harry Potter (although Rowling did a better job of writing, at least in the later books). But I'm wondering whether anyone who's comparing these to Pratchett or Douglas Adams has ever *read* either author. These are fun, but social satire? Not so much. And not nearly as funny, either.(And why don't I remember all the swearing that has several reviewers hot'n'bothered? Apparently, I'm jaded.)"
4,Delightful,"What a clever devil Jasper Fforde proves to be in this mystery novel. The narrative is handled well and remains true to Jane Eyre. The idea of living in scenes within a well-known book is not a new one, but it is certainly handled well in this narrative. Overall, I think most mystery fans would find this book delightful, even if they are not all together familiar with Jane Eyre, the mystery's namesake."
2,Hasn't really earned its praise,"This little book was amusing at first. It boasts a lot of creative and interesting tidbits, but ultimately fails to do anything but titilate readers with flashy narrative devices. I've read this book twice, and I have to say that, having done so, Fforde's debut novel has even less to recommend it than I originally thought. Most of the characters have quizzical, if not nonexistent, motivations and a good portion of the book involves tangents that lead nowhere or fall flat. He doesn't even do anything interesting with the characters from 'Jane Eyre.' All in all, the book is melodramatic, confounding and, above all, cynical, relying as it does on bells and whistles sure to draw the attention of readers (and especially reviewers) hungry for anything remotely clever in concept. True, there are some amusing parts, and the prose is competent, but there's no accounting for the sensation this book was."
3,silly and fun,"For anyone who has every fantasized about literally being able to go into a world in a book, or get to speak to the actual characters, this was fun. It got a bit repetitive for me, though, and I'm not sure I always get that British wit. Nonetheless Thursday Next was a fun heroine I have no doubt will go far in the final draft."
5,delightful!,"I thoroughly enjoyed ""The Eyre Affair"". It was a lot of fun being taken through Thursday Next's world. Most of the characters are so amusing, yet surprisingly genuine seeming. Fforde has a knack with dialogue, everyone's ""voice"" is distinctive and tells as much about their character as description has. I think ""The Eyre Affair"" is my favorite of the series so far."
5,Fantastic!,"Quite frankly, I don't know just how Jasper Fforde makes this stuff up; a parallel 1985. A hundred and fifty years of Crimean War. England giving the Isle of White to France. Dodos. But the best most fun part of this world is that the technology that allows the characters to jump in and out of books seems quite plausible.I also don't quite know how to describe Fforde's heroine Thursday next. She is as special and unique as her name. She's brave and headstrong and nothing ever seems impossible.It's also equally difficult to pigeonhole the book and its sequels into one single genre. Is it fantasy? Science fiction? Comedy? Adventure? Who knows, but once you pick up the EA you might, like me, not be able to put the darned thing down. I can't wait for my own cloned dodo!"
4,The Eyre Affair,This was a wonderful creation of eclectic genres all packed in one story creating a new type of genre. I highly recommend this for book clubs and avid readers who enjoy various writing styles.
3,Only for the severely attention deficit disabled or the intensely acquisitive,"This wildly truncated version of the book was quickly replaced with a nearly unabridged version that most audio listeners know as the only version. This one made it to CD, and should be kept there. It's a collectible, and guaranteed to get a bit dusty.But some of you just know you have to hear this version, too. It's the original British version. I prefer unabridged books in audio, so this one is unbelievably unsuccessful between my ears.No stars for the story, what's left of it. Five stars for existing, at least in this reality, for a little longer. Check your chronograph at the door if you order it."
4,"very clever, charming conceit about books","for a bookworm this is a great idea, a world in which reading is so central that books are real as life, and people can slip back and forth between them. characters from books appear in abundance and there are witty turns on literary devices and such. it's very cleverly done, with a nice light hand, and especially fans of jane austin and the eponymous bronte classic will love it. it's set in an alternative universe in which people keep cloned dodos as pets, etc. and it's entirely too fussy, but it's so english, that just seems in character."
4,Good fun,"No time to talk now; off to read the next in the series. Wish I knew how to rate a book without reviewing it. almost gave it 5 stars, then remembered that smiling happily is not the same as a GREAT BOOK, the sort that you only read a few dozen of in your life."
4,Where Literature Is King,"This book, the first in the Thursday Next Saga, is a really interesting look at a world where everybody takes literature seriously - very seriously. It's also a world where the Crimean War has been going on for more than a hundred years. The action moves around an invention letting people go back and forth into books, with unpredictable and usually very funny results. Fforde has also dropped in a number of openings to other books based on his alternate universe. The bad guy is truly evil, no doubt about it. A very refreshing change from the usual, and a great relief from the stream of Dan Brown books and their clones."
4,"Interesting Concept, OK Book","While I found this novel to be poorly written at times, I was so intrigued by the concept that I just could not put it down. The novel is a mixture of several genres: science fiction, fantasy, mystery, horror, and old fashioned literary fiction. One of the great things about this novel, at least for me, was the alternate universe created by Fforde. In it the Crimean War is still going on. In our world, the Crimean War was a poorly managed lucky win for the British and their French allies and lasted only 2 years. In addition, the idea that literature would play such an important part in everyday life is a nice bit of wishful thinking. Fforde also throws in a lot of humor; one of my favorites is the Rocky Horror type rendition of Richard III, in which audience members participate with the actors. The novel has its flaws, but overall it's a worthy read and I look forward to reading the further adventures of Thursday Next."
5,Literary Fun,"What a hoot, Acheron Hades is thief 'extradinaire'. He steals characters from books and changes the stories. That's okay; his character stealing mayhem only messes with that one book. Hades however, raises the bar and goes after the original manuscripts and kidnaps a character not only from 'one book' but from all future editions of the story. And, not just any character, but Jane Eyre. Will the gothic romance between Jane and Rochester be saved? Will Hades, the 'third most wanted villian' be stopped? Thursday Next - Special Agent, Literary Detective has plans for Hades, but first she must dip into Eyre's tale to capture this time traveling, character stealing villian. Our heroine, Thursday Next in true British form is brilliant and funny and literate. She will retore your faith in The Special Operatives Network - well, at least the Literary Division."
4,Just what would I do if there were Great Book Cults---,"Instead of Football? Admittedly, this is a librophile's dream world--full of the requisite 'sugar plusm dancing over our heads.' Still, Fforde's mystery is a fun read and a good first novel. There's plenty of gratuitous chuckles--such as Jack Schitt and more in-depth humor as well.Will I read more? Good question. I'd call this more an airplane--escape type book than my regular store of fiction. Wonder how much I'd annoy my seatmates in 'steerage' if I took Book 2 on my next flight and chuckled all the way???"
5,A must-read,"There is nothing boring, old or unoriginal about Jason Fforde's ""The Eyre Affair"". From the first page to the last, you will be spellbound by his seemingly limitless imagination. I personally am drawn to the world where people live and breathe literature (perhaps a satire on today's world, where technology is the be-all and end-all of our lives?). I haven't read all the books mentioned in the novel, but by the time I reached the end of the story, I was raging to go, buy and read them! On top of being a hilarious and fast-paced detective/adventure story, I find this book to be a loving tribute to the world of reading and literature, and it will certainly encourage you to read more."
5,loose yourself!,"This book is Harry Potter for bibliophiles. No, really. The HP books are so popular, because they bring out our childhood dreams while still staying (at least, partially) grounded in everyday world we know. The adventures of Thursday Next are build on the premise of being able to enter the works of fiction and interact with the characters. If you ever dreamed about this - you'd love the book. Also the ""real world of Ms.Next (I mean, outside the books) is a treat for a book-lover. With tidbits like collected cards not of football players, but of book characters. I enjoyed every page of this novel!Make no mistake, this book has as much to do with pulp stories as it has with the classic literature of ages past. And while I would love the characters to be more three-dimensional, I don't find the lack of depth of characters to be a drawback of this book. The sheer number and imagination of Ffordes ideas helped me to get lost in a good book."
5,Fun and witty,"I thoroughly enjoyed the world created in Jasper Fforde's book The Eyrie Affair. His main character ,Thursday Next, is a strong, intelligent, and resourceful woman. Bravo!"
2,An attempt at clever,"Unfortunetly the plot of the book did not start until midway into the book. The last 1/4 of the book was pretty decent; it was a clever idea for a novel yet somehow it didn't come out right. The acutal ""Eyre Affair"" wasnt as main a part of the book as you would expect. The first half of the book was slow paced background that had little pertience to the plot. To make the book better, Fforde should have expanded the Jane Eyre part of the novel and perhaps made Thursday Next's stay in Eyre-land longer with more episodes. I just was amazed that the title had little to do with the book. I expected more from this book because the unique plot line appealed to me."
1,Stupid,"I have seen this book recommended countless times for people who are looking for intelligent, witty humor.Huh? There is nothing intelligent, witty, or humorous to be found within these pages. The plot is too unbelievable (and this is coming from a reader that loves a good fantasy), the characters are black and white cartoons, and the wordplay is forced. I didn't laugh once, and I am not that difficult to amuse.If you think numerous references to British authors makes Jasper Fforde an intellectual, this may be the series for you. If you know better, and realize he is just a pretentious and untalented hack, you might want to look elsewhere for your reading pleasure."
2,Uncalculated Crassness,"Jasper Fforde set out to be a genre buster; he intended to show that a book that is undeniably genre fiction could also be intelligent. He litters the book with high minded literary references, Charles Dickens for example. While most of the references probably go over his reader's heads anyway, what they look like to someone who notices them is an attempt to look smart, nothing else. There is little purpose to his references.He also likes to use crass, and unnecessary puns like the character named ""Jack Schitt"" or ""Thursday Next"" the main character in the series. Obvious puns like this hurt his overall cause to make genre fiction intelligent and viable. He would have been better off leaving the crassness out of the final draft.Overall, it's a fairly quick, but irritating read by an author who is dying for you to think he's smarter than you. Enjoy."
1,I simply can't finish this book!,"My bookclub is reading this one. Most of the time I can finish a book, even if the topic doesn't interest me, but not this time. Realizing that I don't like mysteries nor sci-fi, I still thought I would like this book (having loved Jane Eyre), but I don't. Perhaps I read too closely, perhaps I was not in a fantasy mood, perhaps the book just isn't good. Whatever the reason, it is going into the box of books for the used book store and I am moving on to the next book on the list. If you like literary fantasy, sci-fi, and twisted names and plots, then you might like it. My disclaimer is: I have only read 137 pages, so it might be better in the second half......I will never know."
4,"Great introduction, but lacks some info for beginners","This DVD is a short, yet clear and informative, introduction to GMAW welding. I heartily recommend that anyone knew to GMAW welding buy this DVD. However, do not buy it expecting to actually learn how to weld.This DVD really only delves into the background of the process and how the equipment works. I was a bit disappointed to find that it didn't cover anything more than that, such as what a good weld looks like, what a bad weld looks like, technigues for avoiding errors, and so on. Unfortunately, such a DVD doesn't appear to exist anywhere and so trial-and-error appear to be your only instructor unless you're willing to pay to actually go to a welding school (which you should if you're looking to welding as an occupation)"
1,Save your money and go to youtube for free !,"This DVD is a total waste of money.The DVD is well made, but the information and depth is not what would be expected from a beginers instructional Welding DVD.It offers nothing that you can not get for more and for free off the internet.In fact, the information on the web and youtube are superior to this DVD.Here is my tip for you:If you have not bought an auto darkening helmet yet, use the money you save from this DVD and buy the helmet by adding another $25.The Helmet will last longer and it will surely improve your welding.Something this DVD will not do."
3,Very Infectious!,"Go Fish started out as an acapella group but when they signed to Inpop Records they wanted them to add some music. They dont lose anything with this transistion. Still great harmonies and great lyrics. These guys make a great album as their Inpop debut. Some really Great songs like ""Thats What Amazes Me"" ""Youre My Little Girl"" and a bonus track of the Christmas song ""Silent Night."""
2,How someone who lives in her head experiences revolution,"I was disappointed after all the hype about this book. A lot of it consisted of how the author got through the revolution by playing along but being subversive in her home (she had satellite TV and a reading group). She may well be daring for an Iranian intellectual, and certainly people were killed in those days, but she is still a bookish woman trying to get along, and she writes with a bookish distance that doesn't make for an exciting memoir. Even when she is writing about reading during bombing attacks. If you have read the books she discusses, and are inclined toward reading about them, you should probably read the book for that reason. For me, the most interesting part was the reactions of her reading group, other students and Islamic radicals to Western classics."
2,Reading Lolita in Tehran,"Good premise, but writing is rambling, with lack of focus. Too many thoughts not summed up. Difficult to get emotionally connected to characters"
3,"Read ""Persepolis"" instead","Although the story and ties to literature were interesting, the writing style left me disengaged. The best thing this book did for me was inspire me to read Lolita and reread Fitzgerald and Austen. However, the absorbing graphic novel ""Persepolis"" gave me a more rewarding and more accessible vision of Iran during the same time-period."
3,Not as good as Persepolis,"I had heard good things about this book, and read it hopefully, but was disappointed by its rambling, lack of depth, and poor editing that allowed much repetition. I wanted to have better understanding of the individual characters' lives and dreams and how they were affected by their society's extremes, but had only glimpses, even of the author herself. It did give me some insight into the time and place, but if you want an account of what it was like to be a woman during and after the Islamic Revolution in Iran, I recommend you read Persepolis and Persepolis II instead. These books are also memoirs, in this case in a comic book form with simple, elegant art, and they were far more engaging to me, capturing the writer/artist's personal experience in a very vivid way.If you do choose to read Reading Lolita in Tehran, you may enjoy it more if you read the books she discusses first, starting with Lolita itself. Otherwise, a lot of her commentary will go right by."
3,Now we know why Iran is such a disaster,"Much of the book is fascinating. Much of it is downright tedious. I especially enjoyeed the literary comparisons and insights. Favorite part of the book: The Gatsby Trial. I do not admire the author, nor her students; though I feel for them. In fact, I was appalled that the author was so clueless about her radicalism and its consequences, even while her associates were going missing, turning up dead, and being jailed. She finally got mad when they made her wear the veil. That's when her feminist sensitivites were really riled! I'm glad I read the book for the literary commentary. The characters were drawn too shallowly for me to empathize with them, except to know that I am very fortunate not to be in their burkas."
1,Boring.,"I picked up this book because of all the great reviews it was getting. I previously read Bookseller of Kabul and wanted to read another book that was kind of like it. When I started reading it I thought maybe it would get better. I only made it up to page 70 and then gave up. This book is the most boring thing ever. It's like reading analytical essays that you would write for your English class. Azar Nafisi makes it sound like she should be pitied for what she's gone through. Other people in Iran have gone through much worse. What should be pitied is her writing style. Please lady, learn to engage your readers. I was greatly dissapointed. I do not reccomend this book. Read Bookseller of Kabul instead; anything but this book."
3,Interesting historically,"It was interesting to read about the Islamic revolution in Iran, something I previously had little knowledge of. I appreciate the details about the lives of women but the author did tend to wax on about literature quite a bit, so it wasn't the quickest read."
2,Dissapointing!,"The Title is misleading. She spends so much time explaining how Nabokov writes, while I really wanted to know about the girls in her class, how they related to the books, their lives...what did they they think or feel, I waned to know about their lives at home! what do they do or think after the discussions! I didn't feel a connection with the people in the book! I felt as if I were a student in one of her classes. It's a very slow read. I think everybody rushed out and bought the book because of the title!"
2,"Don't read this book -- read ""Lolita"" instead","Although Nafisi claims to be a Nabokov scholar, she seems to have learned nothing from him. Like Nabokov, Nafisi was born into a privileged life which was turned upside down when her native country undergoes revolution. Nabokov tells us in his autobiography ""Speak Memory"" that his losses made it possible for him to have a richer, more meaningful life. Nafisi cannot stop whining about her losses, even though they are far less severe than Nabokov's. She is overwhelmed by self-pity and bitterness. She expresses contempt toward her less ""sophisticated"" countrymen and their vulnerablity to the appeal of the Ayatollah, but she fails to see the failures of her own economic and social class. I'd choose Nabokov over reading about Nabokov anyday."
2,"Oh, Please","I just can't believe all the hype about this book. This woman is not a good writer. Didn't anyone else get tired of hearing about what she was eating and drinking. And her elaborate descriptions didn't even help me keep the young women straight. I stuck with it because I really thought there was going to be something worthwhile that I got from it. I may try the ice cream with coffee and nuts on it. As for Iranian history, try Marjane Satrapi's Persepolis. It is beautiful and poignant. She doesn't eat any ice cream though."
3,Americans! Appreciate and savor our freedom!,"I had read Lolita and was then curious as to what this book was about. It has nothing to do with Lolita, but that book, among many other classics brought this group of women together. It certainly made the book more understandable having read Lolita and The Great Gatsby, but what I got out of this book is how extremely oppressed the citizens of Tehran are. Until reading this book, I didn't understand the magnitude of the oppression and the pervertedness of this country. I can't imagine why anyone would not flee that country.This book was a slow read for me. It was not gripping, not a page turner, but if you want to understand more about this part of the world, then I would say read it, otherwise, it takes persistence to get throught it."
3,Women Bonding,"The backdrop of the story is the ongoing war surrounding the women - bombs hitting buildings in the city, changes taking place in Iranian academia, and increased pressure on women to conform to the dictates of the new Republic.The women are a trusting, close-knit group who get together weekly and share pieces of their lives over literature. The author describes personality traits of her students well. I felt I had some sense of who they were when they met for their regular meetings.The book ended well too. The author went on to inform the reader the different directions her participants' lives took after the group disbanded."
3,My own experience was mixed~,"Well, this was sort of a difficult book for me to tackle - too much unfamiliar literature, literary reference, and philosophy. Since I was curious, but a bit daunted, I thought I'd just read as far as the first book (Lolita) and then quit if I wanted to. I just couldn't focus on, and ""get"" all the abstract points, and there were some parts of the book I read through without trying to understand.In the end, I did read the entire book. There was so much about the life and times in Iran and I really enjoy learning about other people/places/times. In fact, I think I will compliment this book with some other (more accessible) books about the Iran."
3,"Not What I Thought it Would Be, But Interesting Nonethless","I thought this book would be more about the girls in the book club. And it was, in a way. But it was also about politics, teaching, secret relationships, and books. But I think Nafisi was trying to cover too many bases. As interesting as the format was (going back and forth between talking about the books, the girls, the country, and her family), it was a bit dis-jointed.There was a great story underneath all of that, but the nuggets of gold were too few and far-between. I don't know, maybe it was just me, as I see there are a lot great reviews for this book, but I had a hard time getting through it. I guess I was looking for more of a narrative, as opposed to reviews and journalism sprinkled throughout."
4,"""It is difficult to get the news from poems....""","When I signed up the bookring for Reading Lolita in Tehran, I'd anticipated reading a book about a woman fighting for human rights in an increasingly intolerant society. Reading Lolita is this book, but it is much more.Nafisi creates a safe place for women to gather and explore what it means to be human, what it means to be alive, by reading and discussing literature. Nafisi's group faces bullets and beheadings, yet the most awful horror is the day-to-day slow death of the world of the imagination.""It is difficult to get the news from poemsyet men die miserably every dayfor lackof what is found there.""- William Carlos Williams"
1,don't waste your money or shelf space,"i'm so glad to know i wasn't the only one that reacted so negatively to this book~ i too agree with the reviews below, i was so excited to purchase and read this book with all the accolades this author had been receiving, i was extremely disappointed to discover how absolutely BORING this book was. and the funny thing is, i tried (very hard!) to continue reading, hoping that maybe in the next chapters or pages the story would turn interesting, but it never did! if you're looking to read a book to follow a group of young women, hoping to escape the adversity of their country and find peace in the world of fictional novels, this is not the book to read. Reading Lolita critques various novels, but fails to connect to the characters of this book, resulting in reader confusion as to where the storyline is leading (so i'll tell you now, it leads nowhere). don't waste your time."
3,Blah,"O.K., so I will admit that I did not finish reading this book, and this is solely due to one reason: I thought I might die of boredom! Random strangers in the bookstores were recomending this book to me, so I decided to but it, now I regret wasting my money on it. Don't get me wrong the book is beautifully written, the language is lovely, that is. However this is a literary analysis, not a novel. I probably shouldn't judge it without reading the whole thing, but the author goes on and on analysing different literary works, and the development of the novel itself is stagnant. Maybe I lack depth, but I wouldn't recomend this book, unless you are looking for a different view on analysis of Nabokov's works."
1,Just Bad,"This book is very difficult to read. My book club read it and no one (10 women) liked this book. She references other books ALOT - so I think she should have put out a pre-requisite list for readers BEFORE reading this book. Also, it was hard to keep the characters and the timelines straight. It was like pulling teeth to get through this book. I can not beleive it is getting such good reviews and making the best seller lists."
4,Tedious But Important,"The style of this book reminds me of Nabokov's ""Speak Memory"". The subject of this book is in large part about the life and times of a woman in an emerging Islamic theocracy (with touches of discourse on the four featured literary areas: Lolita, The Great Gatsby, Henry James, and Austin). It is presented in a disjointed, piecemeal fashion making it quite hard to walk away with an integrated representation of the intended messages. And yet, there are a lot of interesting and even important revelations about what it was like to be a woman in an emerging Islamic theocracy. I would recommend this book to those with sufficient patience and a strong interest in the Iranian theocracy and/or women in the theocracy."
3,Reading Cliff Notes in America,"Actually, this novel is better than the title suggests. It is about the healing and redemptive power of fiction that enables one to cope with life, however mundane or horrifying. The author holds a secret class at her home, teaching Western literature to a group of students, cloistered, as if in a mosque, while modern-day Iran is plunged into violence, brutality, censorship and chaos. The group's discussions reveal the stark and desperate lives of its members, and that is where the novel excels. But too often, the author lapses into simplistic and self-reverential analyses of the novels that she teaches; it's as if she uses this novel to seek the readers' approval of her literary criticism. In the end, this remarkable story of Iran and the lives of certain of her people are overwhelmed by the author's solipsistic musings."
1,"Apparently, those who can't write . . .","write books about those who can. This book is absolutely unreadable. If you truly have a love of literature, skip this dross and head straight for Nabokov. If you've already read Nabokov, read him again."
3,OK,"The book itself is quite bland but the topic and the lesson of leadership are quite valuable, and while it may seem pointless, it can be an effective piece of writing to study."
4,The power of literature,"For two years in the Islamic Republic of Iran, Nafisi secretly met with her most committed female students to read forbidden Western classics. Fundamentalists had seized control of the universities and morality squads staged arbitrary raids, so these women risked jail or worse if discovered. This story depicts the horror that affects every life as an oppressive regime closes in. Imagine: women enter a special gate at the university where they are physically examined; females are married at the age of nine; adultery and prostitution are punished by stoning to death; women, under law, have half the worth of men; two women, former cabinet ministers, are sentenced to death after the revolution. The book is also a celebration of the power of the literature to awaken and inspire resistance. Nafisi makes you want to read or reread all the books they discussed."
3,Interesting material but that's all...,"The material in this book is extrememly interesting- enough so that I kept reading despite how poorly written the book is. The stories provide a lot of compelling, first-hand information about the oppression of women in Iran. However, the books has no flow, no grace, and no clariy to speak of. It's not difficult to read, but rather uncomfortable.This book leaves the reader with a lot of questions, but not in a good way. I want to know: How is it that someone who has obviously spent so many years studying literature can make mistakes like changing tense for no reason?? Why did she choose to use quotation marks in some places, or for some characters, and not others?? And why didn't she assemble the stories into some sort of order??"
3,Liked the concept but...,it was not well executed. Nafisi is a bright woman with an interesting story. It was not well told. There was a lot of analysis of the literature that the group read and how she felt they related to these books. There was not a lot of examination about the actual culture or the women in her group. I found it a little disappointing.
2,Disappointing,"Like some other readers, I too really liked the concept of this book. Being a woman in a book club and very interested in hearing what it has actually been like to live in an Islamic country, I was intrigued by Nafisi's story. However, I was extremely disappointed. The story wasn't told very well at all and the literary criticism dragged the storyline. I felt I never really got to know any of the girls in her book club, or her for that matter. Not the best book if you are looking for a true life account of the plight of women in Iran."
1,reading lolita in tehran,i am just curious. i know i am coming late to the discussion but did anyone else get the impression she was using this a way to pat herself on the back and let the world know how wonderful and knowledgeable she is. i wanted to learn more about every life not how everyone including a male student watched out for her and wanted her and her privileged life.i struggled to finish the book and will not read anything by her again.
1,reading literaure superficially,"In her memoir of reading Western classics, Ms. Nafisi reveals a pretty shallow mind. Okay, she has read all of these classics, but she spends so much of her book talking about male professors she does not like and male students she does not respect (because they do not share her feminist views). Why include all of this gossip about strangers? She offers little insight about the books themselves. I went away from this book feeling that the author had a big ego but did not really understand literature. She spends too much time on gimmicks, gossip and cream puffs."
3,My Review,"Ok. Just plain Ok. Imsure that others will find it enthralling, Im just not one of them. It sort of dragged on a bit for me. It isnt a bad book, just overrated. The idea of the book, is/was one that nterested me but it just spent too much time on things that didnt need that much time. I think this is a book thart maybe English lit majors would love though. ( I prefer math and science) Maybe thats why this wasnt quite my cup of tea......."
2,"Intriguing, but not very believeable","I liked this book, to a certain extent. It's very interesting (eye-opening) to get a glimpse of Iran during during such turmoil - especially how difficult it was for a woman! But the author seems a bit more removed from the actual tension and violence than the reader is led to believe, in my humble opinion. Perhaps that's because she was at the university and therefore was somewhat sheltered. I mean, how could the local authorities not discover the ladies' meetings when the brother of one of Azar's friends always dropped off his sister with car brakes screeching. Surely that would draw attention to the group....right?"
1,Unreliable picture of Iranian society,"The book addresses political and social structure of Iranian society in an awfully biased way. I did not expect more from some one associated with US neo-cons.One interesting point about her ""veil game"": After 15 years teaching in Iranian Universities and ofcourse wearing veil, Nafisi suddenly discovered that ""University is not a grocery store"" and She should not wear veil!"
4,imprisoning lolita,"A well-written book with a fascinating way to weave books and people together. But in narrowly interpreting a complicated literary work like ¡Lolita¡ as nothing more than a man¡s confiscation of a girl¡s life to fulfill his lost dream or ignoring the darkness of ¡Washington Square¡ by unduly praising Catherine Sloper¡s courage, Nafisi¡s readings demonstrated a hidden casualty brought about by an authoritarian government -- in desperately defying the oppression, a liberal-minded literary scholar of impeccable literary taste would voluntarily and obliviously reduce the rich literary works to fit the simple-minded framework of ¡autonomy vs. control¡or¡oppressor vs. oppressed¡, and in protesting the narrow-minded rejection of Western literary works by the Fundamentalists purely on the ground of morality, Nafisi, in her dissident mode of reading, ironically has also narrow-mindedly ¡confiscated¡ the rich multiplicity of the literary works in question."
1,Reading Lolita in Tehran,"The description of the book was characterized as ""brand new"". The book came with tearing, torn pages. Despicable. Never ordering from this company again."
2,Just OK,"Azar Nafisi's memoir in books, ""Reading Lolita in Tehran,"" relates the struggles of the Iranian people and Nafisi's own experience through the lens of literature.I wish I had liked this novel more than I did. It came highly recommended to me because of my love of The Kite Runner, but I cannot honestly say I enjoyed it. The first half of the book was enjoyable. It detailed how Nafisi taught a course to women and how they bonded over these works of literature. But eventually, this became very tiresome. I think Nafisi should have mixed-up her narrative a little. It needed more action and less reflection."
5,"History, Literature, and Current Events. What a combo!","Fabulous book. I would love to meet the author, meet her students, and I'm off to read the (few) books that she taught that I haven't read yet. Fascinating and compelling."
3,Life and Literature in Iran,"For two years, Azar Nafisi, an Iranian professor, gathered a group of young women into her home every Thursday morning to discuss literature. This circular memoir begins by talking about these weekly meetings, then takes the reader into poignant fragments about Nafisi's life in Iran and how things became the way they are. Throughout the book, learning and discussion occurs through novels such as Lolita and Pride and Prejudice.I found the middle sections a little monotonous. The first and fourth sections were my favorites, because they focused on the girls' group that Professor Nafisi led. I would recommend this book if you love literature and writing and English... or if you want to learn more about the nuances of Islamic life in Iran."
2,Disappointment,"This was our book club selection of the month. We were all anxious to read this book because it sounded so interesting. While there was some interesting information about life in Tehran and their experiences, we were not satisfied with the rambling style of the author and disappointed that we never felt the characters. Many of the group didn't even finish the book."
5,A Must Read!,"I have quotes from this book hanging around my classroom. If I could convince every one of my students to read it, I would. I try as it is. The entire book is worth it for the Gatsby trial alone. If you have a passion for the written word, read this book!"
1,Very disappointing,"I have a feeling that this book is going to be the first book that I cannot bare to read all the way through. I am over half way through, after forcing myself to read it.Even if it completely redeems itself in the second half, I would not change my rating based on the abysmal ~200 pages I have read so far.Her writing is disjointed and her thinking is jumbled. Parts of the book are lectures on classic books, others are simply an enumeration of events that have happened in Iran.I have no idea why Reading Lolita got such a good rating. Perhaps because the idea is good? ""An intelligent Iranian women giving insight on life and struggles in Iran"" sounds like it would make a fantastic book. Maybe it will make a good book some day. Unfortunately this is not itI would not recommend this book."
2,Our Bookclub was not enthusiastic,"All 8 bookclub members found the book concept and content fascinating, but written in a too academic, disjointed way that made all have a hard time reading the book. What all of us hoped for was more character development, and less a literature presentation with some personal comments and stories interspersed. The format wasn't inviting, and it was a chore for most to read."
3,"Tough, but good","This was a difficult book to get into. I felt very uneducated and at a loss, not immediately knowing the plots of the various novels discussed in this book. However, I kept muddling through and felt that it was well worth it. The descriptions of what she and her students endured were amazing! More should be printed in bold in newspapers and on the televised media about what these women endure. It truly makes you appreciative to have been born in the USA."
3,Worth the Effort,"As a person who enjoys literature, but not a student (or teacher) of literature, this book was a bit of a struggle when the discussion of novels by Nabokov, James and Austen came up. When the narration was about the life of women in Iran before, during and after Khomeni, I found it fascinating. Hence, I am giving it a mixed review....but worth the effort."
4,A unique way to learn about women in Iran,"I really enjoyed this book and learned a lot, too. It started slow, but about 1/10 of the way through, it started getting extremely interesting. I could feel what it was like to be a woman during and after the 1979 Islamic revolution in Iran. I learned about it in a way that I could never have fully understood had I just read the facts. The author, by her pace, her ways of describing things, draws you into her world, a world sooooo different from mine in L.A.The discussions of the novels that the author taught in college in Iran are part of the whole story -- illuminating how Iranian women look at their lives. I also learned a lot about the role of imagination and fiction in society -- and that's the whole point of the book. I see how, in the absence of freedom, people can communicate through fiction what they could never say in their blog or in an essay. A very important book, and enjoyable, too."
2,frustrated,"listening to this book on CD, i felt as if i were listening to someone who had to write a thesis on the author of Lolita. Sho had to substantiate every thought and fact about this man according to a class she took, and a professor was going to grade her on every fact and footnote. i didn't like it. Please don't come crashing down on me for my response to this book. everytime i thought something very personal was about to be revealed or flushed out, it was cut short. I feel ms. nafisi kept an implacable barrier up which she put in place to keep the novel impersonal, and that barrier was to make it an academid thesis on nabakov, and in a sophomoric way. fine, but that's not what the book was promoted to be, and not what i would have purchased."
5,Inspiration to finish my English graduate degree,"After two years teaching English overseas and a few other pursuits, I pursued a graduate degree in English ""for my own edification."" However, for various reasons I switched and went and got a professional degree instead in part because it seemed more ""practical.""This book made me readjust my perceptions about the value of teaching humanities. The fact that these diverse women living in a totalitarian state found comfort and camaraderie in reading literary classics, that was a revelation."
4,"Beautiful as it is, but would be improved with a stronger editor","Nafisi alternates between storytelling and lecturing on books, most of which I've read, although she gave enough background that I think it wouldn't ruin the book if a person had not read any of the novels they discuss. My only complaint would be that there wasn't a whole lot of structure; I think that a good editor could have made the timeline a little more clear."
3,Informative but not entertaining,I did not regret reading this book but would not read it again. Insights into the life of Iranian women were fascinating. Many parts of the book were drawn out and boring. Sometimes the story was lost in the details. Not what I expected.
2,"Be Aware, Fiction Readers, this is NOT a Novel!","If you are a fan of quality fiction, where the author draws you in with prose, compelling plots and characters that have you feeling you know them, (and their joy or pain) then you probably won't like this book! It is more like a text or reference book, than it is a story of women bonding, or women that you get to intricately know and care about.This writer sounds like what she is, a teacher, and that is how it is written. The lines and quotes from literature in relation to the plight of the women do parralel, and true, the book makes some profound statements, and instills sympathy for the repressed women, but this is something we already know about, what with our own soldiers over there fighting to help them live better lives.I did not find this an enjoyable read and had trouble picking it up each time I had to, reading this for my Readers Group discussion."
3,Teaching in Iran,"Azar Nafisi's ""Reading Lolita in Tehran"" is a memoir about the impact of the Islamic revolution on the lives of educated women in Iran. Nafisi tells of the great hopes for reform in Iran after the fall of the Shah and the return of Ayatollah Khomeini, and how these hopes were dashed when the Islamic fundamentalists - by arrests, murders, and executions - forced women out of the 20th century back into its cruel medieval past.After being forces to leave teaching in a renowned Iranian university, the author assembles a group of former female students, who secretly meet weekly in her home to discuss literature that was forbidden in the university. The heart of the story is the discussions among the students and the circumstance under which the classes were held."
3,skillfully written but boring,"The book is like a long comparison/contrast essay.It is not in a chronological order, the result is, that it is hard to follow the story.What is amazing is, the autor's fascinating English. Even though she is Iranian and English is her second language, she wrote the book very intellectual."
1,So much to learn about Iran ... NOT!,"Bad title, boring anecdotes of women in Iran in early Eighties, vile sexual innudenos (eating apple by female students considered sexual among Iranian male students, etc. give me break.) And presumably, we are supposed to believe that this frustrated English professer is hip because she loved to listen to Jim Morrison.The only reason, I finished the book was simply because I wanted to make sure I was not mistaken in my judgement not to recommend this book to any of my friends, coworkers, etc..Is it worth your read? noWould you learn about Iran and Iranian women? noAny outstanding literary achievement? absolutely not.Bottom line: Nafisi wanted to ride the tide and pull a fast one, while the label of 'axis of evil' was still hot."
5,Worlds within worlds,"I picked up this book because I was interested in learning more about life under the Ayatollah in Iran. I had no idea how wonderful this book would be. Nafisi has a great love of literature and tries to share that love with her students, even in a very dark time and even where the act of teaching exposes her to great personal risk. Nafisi lived an Orwellian nightmare and takes us through it with humor and insight. An English teacher below commented that the book was boring. Wow, maybe knowing the novels well made it difficult to catch Nafisi's excitement about the books. I found Nafisi inspiring. Her description of life in Tehran was shocking in its brutality to women. Her discussions of Nabokov, Fitzgerald, and James were compelling. She gives us not only her voice, but the voice of her students. Hearing how others looked at these books not only made for a great read, but led me to pick up The Great Gatsby for the first time. Don't miss this book!"
1,Disappointing,"This book was not what I expected. The description led me to believe that I would learn about the struggles and stories of a group of young women braving it in a book club in Iran.It's really a book full of literary commentary and criticism, which gives it a pretentious and distant feel. It's written almost like a reference book for a college Lit. class, lacking real emotion.The book is also difficult to follow, since Nafisi skips back and forth between time periods. I also had a tough time keeping track of the characters.Please don't be misled! I'm sure there are better ways to learn about the struggles people have endured in the Islamic Republic. If, however, you have read the critiqued books (Lolita, Gatsby, etc.) and are interested in Azar Nafisi's literary critiques...then it might be of interest to you."
3,Experiences of a Persian girl,"Before I start, I should say that Dr.Nafisi is a great writer with wonderful skills. However, what she writes is not necessarily true. I lived in Iran for 18 years and I moved to the US recently. I found her story completely untrue. she lived in tehran, the capital, just like me. and the year she decided to teach ""western literature"" to her seven female students was 1995 meaning that Iran was pretty much modern.I read all these literature books that she mentioned in my classes in high school. Neither I nor my professors had any problem with teaching the books. moreover they were not scared of the government as she describes this ""too risky"". I just want people to read such books with an open-mind and do not believe everything that they read or here."
2,Disappointing,"Yes, Nafisi is bright. Her memoir has a few passages that offer insight into the lives of Iranians during a time of oppression and her discussion of literary works of Nabokov, Fitzgerald, and Austen are interesting. Unfortunately, she is also arrogant and humorless. Her book, for the most part, is a disjointed memoir filled with smug self-congratulations."
1,Very Dissapointing,"After all the rave reviews, I thought this would be an enjoyable read. In fact, for the first 70 pages or so, it was, a little. I liked the comparison of Humbert Humbert in Lolita and the ayatolla in Iran. Each attempted to make over their object -the child Lolita and the country Iran- to match their image of them. Each, to a greater or lesser degree, destroyed the object.The author tends to be pretty self-absorbed. Is it really possible that she is the hero in all her relationships? Toward the later part of the book, she acknowledges that she has a tendency to pontificate. Well, by then, this is not news.The experience of reading this book was very difficult. In fact, it became simply a chore to go from page to page. Finally, 60 or so pages from the end, I gave up. I decided that I deserve better than this.I'm glad that some people enjoyed it. Isn't it grand that we can disagree, and in public?"
2,Excellent idea--unimaginitive execution,"&#65279;What a promising idea! The plot of a group of women performing literary rebellion by reading banned western books under an oppressive regiime. It sounded like an enthralling read.Unfortunately, the author does not deliver. It becomes clear that the plot is a thin disguise for a reconstituted academic paper regarding the relevance of Nabokov in this culture. The charactersare not developed, and events are cursorily described. There is little opportunity to become engaged with this story."
2,In need of serious editing,"I wanted so much to like this book. A book about life in Iran in the 1980s written by a woman, a literature professor, sounds fascinating. I was surprised to find that this book isn't very well written. Most of the dialogue and descriptions of the ""girls"" are just painful and the tone of the book is patronizing. I couldn't help wincing every time she used the term ""my girls"" and called her friend ""my magician.""The academic analysis is repetitive and doesn't go very far (almost embarrassingly so), and, unfortunately, we don't learn that much about the author's students or other people around her. The discussions of James, Nabokov and Austen simply reminded me that I could be spending my time reading something much better and more fun."
4,Reading Lolita in Tehran,"First it took time to be used to her way of writing. Time changes suddenly to different direction. And sometimes it's hard to guess who he or she means. Overall, this is a good book, honest, and tell us the insight of what Iran's women's situation was and is. I like this book."
4,Important Book,Women under fundamentalist regimes have their voices taken away. This is the story of women trying to maintain their intellectual dignity under such a regime.
4,A great read about reading,"It is truely amazing the things we take for granted in the United States. This book is about how emotions and situations that occur in the great books of fiction litature are so interesting to those in Iran. The author teaches a group of students about western litature and at the same time liberates there minds from the confining circumstanes that they find themselves in Tehran. This book really opened my eyes as to the extremely challenging environment of living day to day in Tehran. Also, it shows how fortune we are in the west to have access to great works of literture."
1,Truly a disappointment,The author eventually tells us that she hates writing but it shows in the disjointed narrative long before she reveals her preference for teaching. Her sense of loss when she loses her teaching position is obviously intense but very boring to read about after awhile. This is a book that does not live up to its reviews. I recomend that you not waste your money unless poorly written books on important topics are irresistable to you.
2,Mediocre,"I wanted to like this book, I really did. But I couldn't decide whether I was reading a bunch of reviews from a literature class, or if I was reading about Iran. It was frustrating and I wish it had focused on one or the other, since the mix was too inconsistent and irrelevant in most cases. I ended up skipping a ton of pages in the book. Overall I'd say it was ""okay"", and wish it had simply focused on Iran as the main topic. I suppose the approach was pretty original, but it just didn't work for me."
2,Interesting but in need of organization and editing,"Just about everyone in my book club that read this book found it hard to get through, despite the fact we wanted to like it. Interesting material, of course, but it was all over the map."
4,Tehran: the real Orwellian 1984 in 1984,"This terrific book by Azar Nafisi paints a nightmarish Orwellian portrait of modern Iran. During most of the era portrayed, a wrong word or glance threatening the political elite could literally get you killed. For a woman, showing too many strands of hair from under your shawl could get you tortured or killed. It's a revealing story of Iran from an insider's perspective. There's a stark beauty in the paradox of Nafisi teaching great Western literature to sheltered young Islamic women in the midst of a brutal far-right political regime.I listened to Reading Lolita in Tehran unabridged on audio narrated by Lisette Lecat. Lecat does a terrific job capturing the constant tension of Nafisi's world. Her strong voice and wonderful English accent make her narration compelling and captivating.My rating of 4 stars reflects a very interesting and engaging narrative (5 stars) that sometimes lacks cohesion (minus 1 star), leaping abruptly across years, moods and events."
1,BORING,"I really really wanted to like this book...I even read half the book in the hope that it would improve...but I just couldn't stand it.The book starts out about about a weekly book club that meets in Iran to discuss western novels. It's a great subject but the author doesn't take it anywhere. She spends pages discussing Lolita like the english professor she is, but not enough on the people in Iran, or even those in her bookclub... I wanted to blare out, please move on! Please stop talking about lolita, I can buy Lolita and read if I wanted myself, I read about about ""Reading Lolita in Tehran"", not ""The True Meaning of Lolita"". And what the heck happend to her bookclub? The club appears in the beginning and then vanishes...The title should be changed to ""Much You Do About An English Professor in Iran""..Just my two cents..."
3,Pandering to American Middle-brow WASPs,"How many of the people falling over themselves to praise this book have read any Nabakov?? Or have any understanding of the complexities of Iranian society and culture?? This is certainly a worthwhile book to read, but its ""flavor of the week"" popularity says a lot about the smarmy character of WASP middle-brow culture."
1,Self congratulatory drivel,"At the end of the day, this book was more about telling the reader how wonderful the author is than how beleaguered the women of Tehran are. The author was so self-conscious that it overwhelmed the subject matter. I found this book a chore."
2,Beats Me,"I don't understand the success of ""Reading Lolita in Tehran"". I thought it so boring at times. I hated the Nafisi 's lectures on Henry James etc. Nafisi made great writers sound deadly. I wish that Azar Nafisi had spent more time on her students."
1,Skip this one,I selected this book as my pick for my book clubs November read. Only one person of twelve could even stay interested enough to complete the book. The author is just really boring and hard to follow.
1,This Author loves to drone on and on.....,"I was so bored with this book that I ended up not finishing it. It's a shame because I love reading about other cultures and was very intrigued by the concept of this book.Unfortunately, the book is very unpleasant to read. First of all, the author is rather cold and emotionless, the book reads like a textbook; secondly, the prose is not pretty and does not flow well, again, reads like a boring old textbook."
2,Zzzzz....,"I found this book to be very difficult to read, and more about the literature than about the lives of the women involved. The overblown prose and flowery language were difficult to decipher, and I fought to stay awake more than once. I had trouble finishing it, and never reached the point where the effort paid off in lessons learned or insights gained."
4,To Walk in another woman's shoes,"This book provided fascinating insights into life in revolutionary Iran. It is NOT necessary to read Lolita to enjoy it. Not wishing to spend a lot of time repeating what other reviewers said, two items in the book were most interesting for me. The first was the incident of the young man who is confronted with his inability to bury his grandmother because she was of the Baha'i Faith and all the Baha'i cemeteries have been bulldozed. The second was the insight into those who wore the veil BEFORE the revolution and how the enforced dress code for all makes them feel.The book has great value to thinking people today not only to teach us about the oppression which still continues in Iran but also to give us insights into the thoughts of ordinary thinking Moslems."
3,"Great topic, boring to read","I'll be honest with you. I couldn't finish this book. It's though refreshing and draws a great deal of westerners' attention to the oppressive Iranian society and regime but hey the author has written a very boring book. Maybe because I know the Iranian society pretty well and therefore the book is boring to me. I am not sure but I have heard three of my friends (Canadians and Americans) who read this telling me that they had a hard time understanding this book or how boring it was. But all in all, this book was/is a necessary one to shed light on the problems of the Iranian society. 3 out of 5 stars"
3,"A women's jorney through war, totalitarianism and great works of fiction","Reading Lolita in Tehran is a journey through a warn torn nation, through the eyes of several woman who struggle with who they are in relation to what's going on around them. Their sanity is preserved through their deep exploration of great works of fiction from Nabokov to Fitzgerald to Henry James to Jane Austen. This is a thoughtful book from an author who seems far more in love with reading than writing."
5,Breathtaking Testimony to the Transformative Power of Books,"When I worked for the 1970s for Author Jamake Highwater we often spoke about his thesis outlined in THE PRIMAL MIND, that the biggest thing separating people is not distance, but culture. READING LOLITA IN TEHRAN brilliantly proves Highwater's point and its corollary simultaneously. Like Jazz Composer and Saxophonist Oliver Lake wrote, ""We Are the Same, But We Are Different."" Azar Nafisi's courageous work reminds us that we have more in common with each other than we think. This passionately drawn portrait of women reading together in secret books from a culture alien, distant, and politically in opposition to the one in which they live, evokes laughter and tears in recognition of how no matter how different our cultures are, we all share the human hunger for knowledge, equality, freedom and justice."
3,Need literature background for this one!,"This book is full of references to other literature such as Jane Austen and Scott Fitzgerald. I found it hard to read, but if you are knowledgeable about literature, I'm sure you will find it rewarding."
1,Finally Gave Up,"I slogged faithfully through this...it has been praised from there to here and everywhere, after all...but towards the end I laid it down & I just couldn't finish it. And that is a rarity for me.I think the book lacks a true FOCUS. Perhaps the author is a good writer, perhaps the subject seems interesting, but somehow it never seemed to come together. And I am disappointed because I really wanted to like this book."
2,Political correctness,"While railing against the political correctness of the (undoubtedly horrendous ) regime under which Nafisi taught, , the author runs straight into the arms of another sort of feminist political correctness according to which all the men are theocratic and oppressive monsters, and all the women beautiful, fragile but oppressed creatures.The insights on English literature are not particularly perceptive. Disappointing."
1,piece of literary crap,"im only giving this one star because I cant give 0. The book doesnt reel you in like you'd expect. Nafisi writes so pretentiously that you want to slap her and the droning on about Nabakov is unreal. None of it really brings together a great STORY. Its just a bunch of rambling, and i honestly got a headache reading it. I am one of those people who can read long books, i have no problem with that, but this was brutally boring and just pointless.Also, i have heard many people in reviews on Amazon, and elsewhere that claim many of the books were not banned in Iran and it doesnt make the book much better in my eyes.If you would like to read a book about a Islamic society, well written with enchanting characters, read THE KITE RUNNER."
2,No! don't do it!,"I tried really hard. I read past half the book and I tried, but no it did not catch my interest. I kept thinking it was going to get better, that i was getting to the good part, but no. I wanted to know more about the women in the story. I hung in there just to find out, but nothing. It is the book reviews of book reviews and I wasn't even getting college credits. NO entertainment. Acctually if a professor made her class read this she would most probably want them to hate reading. It was given to me by a friend and I told her how I felt and she felt the same! Don't do it!"
3,"An Enjoyable, Insightful Read","Nafisi does a nice job of taking the reader into the lives of women forced to live under Islamic rule in Iran. Anyone interested in the struggle for gender equality or a better understanding of the life lived by many Iranian women should enjoy this book. Perhaps it strays a little too far from the theme of forbidden Western literature into the relationships between a professor and her students but if one understands that the examples of illegal novels serve as a fine, albeit small, example of oppression then the book's purpose is well served."
1,Not a book for everyone...,"It is not that I disliked the book as much as it did not meet my expectations. This is NOT a book about a book club, which is what my book club wanted. I belong to a book club for mom's-- none of us had the kind of time it required to get through the books in six weeks' time.... and we are a group of women who happens to often read two books in that same timeframe.This is also not a book for the casual reader, as I am. I have not read, nor will ever have the time to read, all of the books that the author discusses in her book. Her ""book reports"" within her novel are distracting, confusing, and tedious. I was excited initially to learn more about a new culture, as I know very little about Iran, and the struggles of its women. I am not sure I feel more enlightened after having read the book.I would recommend this book to those with the time, background, and love of classic literature. Other than that, don't waste your time!"
3,A tough reading,"This is a very interesting book that teaches you about the Iranian style of life during the Islamic Revolution. However, the way the author changed topics a lot made the book confusing and hard to follow. It will go from talking about her group of students, to talking about politics, and then her life as a teacher during the revolution. Though many of those stories were shocking of what women had to go through during the revolution.I didnt like how it was engaging in beginning, but slowed down towards the middle which made it hard to finish. I liked the way Nafisi used symbolism and literary devices, but many of them made the book uninteresting. Towards the end the book started to pick up. Overall, I enjoyed reading this book and thought it was interesting. I learned many things about life in Iran and the Islamic Revolution. I would recommend it to anyone who doesn't get irritated easily and that can follow the story carefully."
3,Good book but slow read,"We picked this book as a bookclub choice earlier this year. Though well written and a great book overall, it is a very slow read. I would definitely recommend this book, but it is probably not the best choice for a young women's bookclub."
2,pretentious,"Academics who have written a few papers for conferences sometimes think they can write for a general audience and believe that anything they say will be of interest. Sadly, this book is one of those. Being pretentious, it has two strikes against it from the start. While there are some interesting observations along the way, the book is slow, generally dull, and often rambles. A good memoir needs more life."
1,Quit after getting half way through!!! Very dissappointing.,"I thought this was going to be dangerous, and scandalous. I thought that I was going to be reading about a group of women who defy society and the law. I got halfway through and still hadn't come to that part and against my usual practice, I decided that I had wasted enough of my time getting to the guts of this one. Most of it is about a university class dissecting the Great Gastby and the over indulgences of Western Society. I thought that I was going to get a great ""sisterhood"" book and be inspired by women that stand up for what they believe, I felt very let down. This book lacks passion for anything, life, love, friendship, students, and freedom. This book is very flat and did not inspire any response from me at all. I was disappointed"
2,Don't know what everyone is raving about...,"The author must have used every 3+ syllable word in her vocabulary. No, it's not that I couldn't understand her, it was just pretentious and hollow. Come on, taking a whole paragraph to describe getting out of the shower?!? I could have done without all the flowery language and it would have been a better book. It dragged a lot in some places, too. I think if she left out all the inane descriptions and exaggerated language, it would have been about 50 pages shorter. Her intentions were good. The stories to tell were interesting but her style of writing was too phony."
1,Couldn't get through it,"This book is like reading a text book. It is rare that I don't finish a book, but I just couldn't do it with this one. Can't recommend it at all."
1,Just a bit skiewed...,"Basically, this is an extremely exagerated portrayal of Iran and the middle east, and it only furthers false stereotypes such as ""the suppressed middle eastern woman"" or the ""the sexually aggressive muslim man."" Both of these ideas are false, and I would know because my mother is an iranian woman who has gone back to visit her hometown Shiraz many times in the past years, only to find that she manages to enjoy herself in this oppressive society. I myself have visited iran twice, and I recall seeing and meeting many many happy women while I was there."
3,Not as much info as I would have liked.,The book illustrates the nightmare women are be forced to endure in a society where religious extremists rule the land. I was hoping for more detailed information on how the women survive in the shadows of a male dominated society. This book touches on the oppression the women are encountering in the middle east.A good book to show how quickly societal norms can change. And how easily a population can be controlled.
2,Focus On The Story,"Nafisi has a wonderful concept: writing about a group of women who are so desirous to learn, that they literally risk their lives to do so. The shortcoming of this book is that the writer is more interested in conveying her opinions of the lessons she gives than in relaying the stories of her students. Nafisi can't resist lecturing the reader. Quite frankly, I couldn't care less what she thinks about Nabokov. Apparently, Nafisi is more interested in her own apparent insights than any risks her students take or any wisdom them might have. Her ego is too prominent in what might otherwise have been an inspiring story."
1,doesnt offer any new insight,"There is no doubt in anyone's mind that Islamic Republic of Iran is an oppressive regime. Not only is Reading Lolita in Tehran a 200 page rambling essay that tells us nothing we did not know, it also makes the ridiculous suggestion that the only way girls in Iran can escape from this oppression is by reading western literature because only (male) western writers can truely express what an iranian woman feels. Don't waste your time with this book. If you are looking to learn about Iran and the reformist movement at the turn of the millenium read ""Searching for Hassan"" by Terence Ward."
5,Tells the real way woman/people are treated in Tehran,My reading teacher emailed me and said to read it.
2,this book sucks,"yo I read this for a class on iranian authors and it sucks. its very girly and hard to follow. also you have to have read gatsby, lolita and others to have a clue as to what shes talking about. if you like wordy girly stories about nothing and incoherent, non linear story telling this is for you.along the same lines read persepolis or the bathhouse - both are much better and actually have more insights."
2,"A missed opportunity,","Although I picked up this book hoping to gain insight into the plight of intellectual women in Iran, I was distracted by the overall lack of cohesion in this book. The point of Nafisi's book becomes buried in literary anaylsis and disconnected narrative. She intends to use Lolita as a metaphor for Iranian society's oppression toward it citizens and women in particular, but instead of letting the metaphor emerge on its own, she drills it into us through pages and pages in ecstacy of Nobokov.Nafisi seems unaware that the strength of her novel should come from the stories of her students, not from her own ponderous pontification. She has an evocative style of writing that would have been well suited to illuminating a world to which we as readers would not otherwise have access, but her prose is wasted on novels that we can read on our own and draw our own conclusions."
1,Just crap,"People who watch this dreck, really, really, really, need to get out more. This is the worst voyeurism combined with trash tv possible."
1,Why does MTV suck so much??,"Come on, this doesn't even have anything remotely to do with MUSIC- what's it doing on MTV? I used to want cable because of MTV, now MTV is one of the main reasons why I DON'T have cable. This show certainly looks good for a laugh, but it doesn't belong on MTV."
5,Awsome voice,I stumbled across Mariza by chance - I was channel flicking and came across a concert of hers on TV. My wife and I sat glued to the set for the next hour - that's how compelling her voice is.
1,Fado for people who don't know what Fado is...,"If you know Amália Rodrigues, Alfredo Marceneiro, Luis Goís, Luís Marinho, Menano, Ana Bobone and many other great Portuguese Fado singers fro the past you will understand what Fado is about. Marisa is an imitator, she has the voice and the manners but not much more... She doesn't sing the Fado... Brrrr!"
2,Sigh!,"Mariza has the ""balls"" but not the soul. Amalia Rodrigues was not only the Queen of Fado but one of the greatest singers ever. Mariza is not even close."
5,Opposition,"Sorry everyone, I do not see a connection to Amália other than singing Fado. It would be like comparing Acqua to Rickie Lee Jones just because they sung Pop music in times. Mariza has her own space and style and though the comparison should make her proud, it does not fit. Mariza inspires the Listener even without knowing a single word of portuguese - and that she has in common with Amália, but she does it in her own way. Maybe her african roots help her, maybe the inner voice is more ""real"", maybe it's just something personal, but reality is that she does sound unique."
5,Absolutely Best CD I've gotten in the last 2 or 3 years!,"I happened to select this CD in late 2002 as a free premium for pledging money to a world music radio show; I wanted to add a Fado CD to my collection since I had heard bits of Misia and liked her. I didn't know how blown away I would be by Mariza!!!! I think I listened to this every day for at least 6 months, and even now, I am not tired of it.I started out with a couple of favorites, especially the ultra-upbeat ""Oia la ó senhor vinho,"" which along with ""Maria Lisba"" is the best mood lifter I can think of. Even the songs I didn't love at first, I came to enjoy just as much over time; in fact, my favorite tracks changed as time went on, which to me is the sign of a classic.Though some tracks verge on being slightly overproduced or too slick, I couldn't recommend this CD more. I love Mariza; I've become a huge fado fan (have bought several CDs by Cristina Branco, Dulce Pontes, & Misia); and I can't wait to get to Portugal someday soon."
5,Commuter's Joyful Lament,"I knew nothing of Fado. I walked into a record store last weekend, where Mariza was signing albums. In the background, her music came into my ears and wandered into my mind. I left the store with another CD, a sure thing I hoped would ease commuter blues, but her music stayed with me. I asked a friend to return to the store and buy it for me, and she returned with a signed CD. All I can say is that I am at peace listening to this music, even in the worst of commutes, and in touch with emotions, sadness, creativity, and longing. I will listen to more Fado, and I wish Mariza the best of luck. I will look for her performances."
5,wow,my first encounter with fado Mariza is fantastic...I love this cd...and the song chuva is amazing..if you have a bad day listen to this song very loud
5,Essa garota pode cantar como uma anja!,"Mariza has a voice like butter. Smooth, comfortable, sexy, even.If you are not familiar with the genre, Fados (Portuguese for Fates), is afolk genre from Portugal that may remind you of Spanish and Italian folk genres, withunique rythms, mandolin and guitar, soulful singing. I suppose it's hard to explain, but, you should hear it.Se ja conhece Fados, é provável que ja conhece a Mariza, quem canta como uma anja..."
5,A Great 1st Fado CD,"If you're like me, you know a little about Fado, but you're not sure how get started with it. I assure you this is a great first choice.It's 1st Fado CD I've purchased. Prior to that, I had heard some classic Fado by Amalia Rodrigues on public radio [web address].I had a general sense of what Fado music was all about, but I did not know where to start a collection other than with Amalia R.Then a friend bought this CD for me - it was a perfect selection! This CD is teriffic and I cannot stop listening to it.Mariza's voice is powerful and yet tender and full of emotion. She's in full control. The compositions are all memorable and infectous. The arrangements are solid, the muscianship excellent, and the recording is top notch.Trust me -- you'll be hooked once you listen to this."
5,Better than Amalia,Mariza has a voice that will touch your soul. If you have never heard fado you will be enchanted by the voice of this artist. She has a depth in all range of keys and sings from the heart. You might like to see the DVD she has of a live concert in Lisbon this will truly let you into her private world.
5,beautiful,"I first saw Mariza on a ""Bravo"" video. Although the songs are sung in Portuguese...which I profess to have no translational ability to convert ~ the beauty of Mariza's voice and the purity of the musical accompaniament of this entire CD transcends completely & obliterates the language barrier.I understand that when Mariza began her career as a singer ~ she was compared to the biggest icon of the Fado of all times...Amália Rodrigues... I have since purchased a CD of Amália & can guarantee...Mariza wins hands up!Put your head phones on, drop out and tune in...you will be transported to the beautiful!!! :-)"
5,Outstanding Product/Value,"I was looking for a Tambour style mantle clock and had found a dozen or more fine looking products on Amazon. But thanks to Amazon's pricing alert I saw that this already low-priced clock had dropped to less than half of it's original low price, so I snapped it up. Yes, it was made in China, but it is every bit as good as the other reviewers had said. Well built, very nice woodwork, and solid oak(!). 21st century clockworks with 19th century styling; a nice combination!"
1,"Great initially, but it DOESN'T LAST","I originally gave this clock 5 stars, because it really appears quality made. But in less than a year the radio control quit working properly. That wouldn't have made the clock useless if you could adjust it to the correct time yourself, but there's no way you can do that with this clock! What a shame."
3,It DID work good...UNTIL.............,"When daylight savings time in November, 2007 came, the clock did not adjust. I live in CA, so I can't force the time to correct by adjusting the time zone. Does anyone know how to change the time?EDIT on 11/13/07: I was able to adjust the time by turning off the daylight savings time mode. I looked up the manual via a link here on Amazon. The DST is an unmarked, small button. Not very convenient. If you can keep the DST settings in synch, this is a great product."
4,Inspiring reading for kids - librarian's 4 star award,"If the first book is indicative of the series, then kids can look forward to an exciting time. It is a rare treat when an author can take the life of an athlete who has had a singular pursuit of their sport and make it an enriching, enjoyable story.I recommend this book for schools."
4,Transcription,"The following is a transcription of the tenth track on the album (the sixth on the second CD). See if you enjoy the lyrics from this excerpt.lhiSDbfl uioshdrof97h w4h,bvdious hoiu kljdsnlkjgcbnilugilkau dligfujklsfvuireghio uhvbnm fhiuvhaerilv gyIWg beli BLKJ BHLIUFHL UILESHfl iuHKLuhILUhbgiluegr hgilehnbjkkjlbkljbrlzkdjh glukhkl zh dklu hkluh b! jmgfnbjlsn gkjbh iayufg iluwyGE 4IULFABH3fhbhj hbsfjhdg ibdfyhjvb aidyf gogrfkuyg zdofygao 8g eriyg fidrgk areniltuabergjkvdfhzib luaethgiluehkvndfmg mvnbs kgrjkl hir k ook jfoug oauerhgiluhr oaig jkfjxc ghi r gituahgiugfh iughriu hgoizurhgpo iadfjnoiutyco8ki7weo7ybhirungaiuy5anbiyhb iurhiauh"
5,ELFMAN NEVER DISAPPOINTS,"""Instinct"" is typical Elfman: grand graceful choruses, deft percussion, weeping strings, and booming brass. Track 2 is the highlight of this CD, for its ethereally gentle choruses rising and falling, weaving in and out of string passages; it is also one of the longest tracks (around eight minutes long). Dramatic and sorrowful, ""Instinct"" contains more than is revealed in Amazon's little music samples; it is a sprawling epic, a truly mature and glorious work from the king of composing: Danny Elfman. Hail Elfman! For he can do it all, and do it well."
3,A surprising score!,"Danny Elfman, the Man. His remarkable talent continue to prouve that HE is one of the best Composer in his generation. It's not his Best score, but it's far better and Different than his recent 'A Simple Plan' score. It's a SOFT and CALM music and enjoyable to listen. Track 7 (Escape) is the best piece in this CD. But, there are a Bad point in this score, it's too short and The final moment did not have an grandiose note like ''Grand Final'' in 'Edward Scissorhands or 'Black Beauty', for example... Overall, it's a pretty good score, probably his Second best score (afer 'Sleepy Hollow') of the final Century..."
2,Not a lot of meat.,The book gets you excited. Lots of testimonials but does not go into any detail on how to pick the investments (the plug for the Wall Street Workshop). Wade if probably sincere and for real but this book is a hardcover advertisement.
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS BOOK!,"Well, I see from the reviews posted recently that some of WC employees are doing their duty by writing in. You can take my advice or leave it, it's up to you, but I'm telling you anything you buy from Wade Cook is a total waste of your money. Every book, seminar, or course he sells has one motive in mind, to get you to buy more and more Cook products. There are lots of excellent books available on investing and trading from people who actually made their fortunes trading, not by selling seminars and books like Mr. Cook. I notice one of the reviews said "" Mr. Cook realizes most people read on a 9th grade level, so he keeps is simple."" I've got some serious news for you my friend, if you can do no better than a 9th grade reading level, and you think you're going to learn to trade the markets, you are sadly mistaken. I have a suggestion for you, take your money and go to Vegas. You'll have a much better time than if you hand it over to professional traders."
1,"Bad, bad, and bad","This book is a total sham. All you have to do to make money under his system is to know whether a stock is going up or down. If you knew that then you certainly would not need any strategies in his book to make money. This book is really just one big promotion for his seminars. If he were as successful at trading stocks as he says, do you think he would be telling the rest of the world his secret?"
1,This book is for fools!,It simply is not true. Wade does not document his outragous claims with credible evidence. His method of investing is a proven method of how to make him rich. And for that I commend him. I am just glad I have never given a cent to the likes of him and that Charles Given.Have a nice day
1,Con job,"I can see from reading the reviews here that there are two types of people writing: (1) Those that have read the book (or any small part of it) and, (2) Wade's employees or friends or cohorts. He's selling you advertising to go to his seminar(s). Period. There is so much wrong with this book that I am disgusted that I bought it. Hype and contradiction. Wow 'em and woe 'em but no data. BUT if you would just come to my seminar..."
1,Misleading Hype!,This book could be the most harmful book a beginning investor could ever read. It makes the stock market look like a fun game that no one could ever lose at. This book oversimplifies trading strategies and market timing to the point of absurdity. Wade Cook lost millions last year by following his own strategies and this was in a bull market. Read Warren Buffet or the Motely Fool. They have proven their strategies work.
1,A sucker born every second,"I saw a number of 8s and 10s rating given to this book; I would like to wish these reviewers good luck. If Mr. Cook really believe his own formula of investing, he would not be selling his formula - least of all for a few bucks. His real formula is this: ""send me ten bucks and I will show you how I become rich."" After sending your money he will tell you he became rich because of all the suckers who had sent him the ten bucks!"
1,Dont buy it!!!!!!!!!!!,"I bought both Wall street money machine and this book. I tried his seminars and subcribed to his online ""money machine"" W.I.N. I lost $1,235.00 so far in the stock market using his strategies. I do not recommend this book nor any others that he has written. I do recommend doing your homework before you invest. I did; and recovered the money I lost and at last count was up by $1897.00."
1,And Fairytales Can Come True,"Picked up this book just to see what it had. Has such important information as Buy options on stock that is in the public spotlight. What a concept! There is nothing here that common sense and a few minutes with an online investment site won't give you. In fact the common sense will be a new concept, this book does not deal in it. Follow the author's advice and you can write a book too,""How I Lost All My Money In The Stock Market."" If you are looking for a nice book to get you started, try Joel Greenblatt's You Can Be A Stock Market Genius. It's much better written, gives good ideas and is far more responsible."
1,"A very ""thin"" book.","The book is aimed at uninformed ""investors"", trying to lure them with a catchy title and too good to be true eclectic wealth methods. Any informed investor could not take this book seriously. Shameless self-promotion and lots of story telling hype is used as filler. The goal of the book is not to inform, but to promote his other financial offerings. Wade Cook's book epitomizes the phrase: ""There's a sucker born every minute"". I would advise those seeking financial and wealth building techniques to look elsewhere for sound knowledge."
3,WALL STREET MONEY MACHINE PART II,That should have been the title of this book. It is a excellent book with lots of information. It has lots of sample returns and charts. It is a continuation of his favorite concepts from Wall Street Money Machine. Note: This book is not for a novice!!
2,"Cooks ""Miracles"" are not so miraculous","Wade Cook's SMM is poorly written, but it is an okay primer on the subject of options. It is very possible to make the sums of money that Cook talks about; but it is certainly possible to lose the whole principal. The writing of the book deserves a 2, however. It is poorly worded and over-hyped. By the end of the book, I was well acquainted with his phone number and all of his other books. My suggestion is to save your time and money and read another book about stock options, especially one without the get-rich-quick hype."
1,Nothing more than a get-rich-quick scheme.,"For those who love his books, you should read Peter Lynch's or any book about Warren Buffett. For those who saw through his none-sense Good for you!"
1,Cook Has Definitely Sunk To The Bottom!,"Cook's previous book, ""Wall Street Money Machine"" was actually quite interesting and gave me a good introduction to stock market investing. However, in this new book, all Cook has done is repeat everything he said in his previous book. On top of that, Cook COULD NOT stop talking about joining his seminars. I hated this book so much I returned it to my local bookstore and got a refund"
2,Cook makes his money selling books and seminars,"Cook's previous book, Wall Street Money Machine, was quiteinteresting. However, this new book, SMM is a shameless 260 pageadvertisement for his W.I.N network and all of his other tapes and seminars. That's the way he makes all of his money - by selling these books with all sorts of advertisements for his seminars, and including ""testimonials"" of totally inexperienced people who just got lucky on a trade. If you take out all of the advertisements, I'd rate this book a 7-8. His strategies can work, however one needs to do a lot of research before speculating on the market."
1,Is this possible for the small investor to accomplish?,"I have read several books by Wade and have studied his Wall Street Work Shop material. The cab driver story is the funniest and unique story I have ever read, NOT! Can't he come up with a new one? I found the strategies to work but hard to figure out for the new investor. I would recommend Wall Street 101 if you want a really good basic manual on how to invest. The author, Frank Saunders, systematically walks the new investor through all the steps to follow and gives the reader everything he needs to do to realize excellent returns in the market. The book is available in the Amazon Z shops... ...over 275 pages of well presented information. Don't waste your money on Mr. Cook's books or seminars, just get Frank's book and have something left over to invest with."
3,"Nice product, but hard to separate!!","I bought these flame decals to use to decorate a gift for a friend. I was in for a real surprise, when I tried to take the flames apart, and they were all ONE SHEET!!!! I had to use a very sharp blade to cut around each flame decal. It took an hour for me to separate the flames!! I did not see in the description that it would be one whole sheet. Be aware that you will have to do alot of work to use these. The finished product was great, but remember, it will take awhile to cut them out!!!"
1,Flames Decal,This decal comes all in a sheet together. I would have to cut the flame out and it may take a longtime. Not worth the trouble. I do not recomend!ThanksAlan A.
5,The work great!,"If I could paint well, I would not need these, but it is nice to know Parma has these available to everyone. I use this to create a nostalgic look on a particular R/C model I was building. They look great and the quality of the decals were excellent."
3,Better Than Nothing,"This book is better than nothing. Unfortunately that's its competition on this subject matter. Perhaps due to his privacy, or maybe his limited time as a public official, very little is written about George Mason. That's a shame really, as he put the liberty movement in the colonies to words.'Reluctant Statesman' is a mere 110 pages (with large print and illustrations no less!). The saddest part of all, is that this is probably overkill for the limited amount of information contained within those pages. Reading this book won't give you much more than a quick glance at an encyclopedia entry would.I'd recommend this book to anyone looking for a brief introduction to Mason. Just be forewarned, this is only a brief introduction and nothing more."
3,Accessible Introduction to Lesser Known Revolutionary,"This is an accessible introduction to George Mason, a Revolutionary Virginian of lesser fame. The book is very short and the print rather large, making this an easy read. Robert Rutland dwells mostly on Mason's public life, only hinting at his private life. Like Jefferson, Mason was a slaveholder who abhorred slavery (he wished the Constitutional Convention had abolished it), but Rutland leaves this paradox unexplored. For those of a scholarly bent, the book lacks footnotes. Mason was the moving force behind Virginia's Declaration of Rights, and, for that reason alone, is quite significant. Any person wishing to learn more about him will find this book a good place to start."
2,Product not as described.,"I have read this book before and was really anticipating it's arrival. After waiting 3 weeks, the book came to me in very poor condition. Not to mention I paid roughly $18 total and the book was send with a $2.00 sticker on the cover. Nice. Plus, the book was listed as Used-Very good condition, but I would say it was in poor condition.I emailed the seller and he offered for me to send it back and be reimbursed, but I was out of the country at the time and had no way to send it back in the allotted time. I would not purchase anything more from this seller."
5,Exciting read!,"This is a fast-paced, exciting read! It is filled with suspense, while showing a thorough knowledge of the process adult survivors of childhood abuse experience as they struggle to face the horror of their childhoods and yet take responsibility for choices in their adult lives. It shows compassion, understanding, and forgiveness of those who have made wrong choices but are trying to make their adult lives into something better."
5,Should use regardless of what you work on.,These fit a pair of my jacks very well but make sure to measure yours as it needs to be snug. You don't need a show car to appreciate not denting the underside of your vehicle all over the place.
4,Nice little pocket knife,"This is a nice little knife. I like the pocket clip, as it keeps the knife accessible. I would have awarded five stars if this had been made in the USA."
1,False advertisement at the best,"They lead you to believe this knife fully opens it selff, NOT TRUE and i exspected more from GErber but should have knowen it be advertised by amazon whom blames Gerber, do you think Gerber Lies after 100 years making knives not methe add said spring loaded fully assited opening, you can open my buck knife just as fast if not faster and it has no spring just a flick of the wrist which is what this knife requiresagain false advertisement unless you want a fancy wrist flicking knife this is not for youim returning mine back to gerber because amazon is to cheap to return itif not defective well i pointed out the addvertisement was defective and the blamed that on gerber which Gerber fully denys; who do you believe a company who has taken care of 1000's of customers making knifes customers for over 100 years or a internet crookwes weatherly 87 years old"
1,Very disappointed,I was very disappointed when the product arrived. It was not the knife I thought it to be when viewing it online.
3,wish it would not rust,I got 2 of these for a brick bar b q. I wish i could have gotten them in stainless steel but was not available for the size i needed. Trying to keep them from rusting is almost impossible. Clean them as soon as we are done using them and do not leave them outside.
4,Worth your $$$$,"If your an Rn'B fan and you loved Tamia's debut album then u should get this C.D. Let's face it Tamia's last album was disappointing even though 'Stranger in my house' is an excellent song with even better vocals.The best songs on this C.d are:More- Catchy, awesome but typical Rn'B song.Still-- Slow but catchy song about her husband Grant Hill.I'm yours latelyInto u- Tamia re-released this song because it's awesome.SmilePoetry- Gospel type vocals.(they long 2 be) close to u- Excellent slow songWhy ask why- LISTEN TO THIS SONG FIRST, IT'S HOT.Tomorrow (musical type song)+ Mr Cool are worth listening to only for Tamia's AMAZING voice.Other recent Rn'B albums worth your cash:Ciara- GoodiesATL-The ATL projectBrandy-AfrodisiacFrankee- The good,the bad + the ugly"
3,I'm not blown away......,"Many of the other reviewers are really blown away by this album, but when I compare it to her previous two cds, I'm not as pleased. Not to say that ""More"" is a bad album. It's fairly solid, there just aren't any really great songs on this album, just a bunch of good ones. If I had to pick anything that does stand out, it may be the song with Gerald Levert, and of course her first single Officially Missing You. Other than that though, I think we've heard better from this talented woman."
4,Tamia is on top of her game!,"I have always loved Tamia since her debut. This CD shows and proves that this girl still has what it takes. Great vocals and a nice mix of uptempo songs and ballads! There are a few songs on here that just don't seem to fit on here but the rest makes up for those.Standout tracks on here are: ""Mr. Cool"" (a fun upbeat song), ""On My Way"", ""Still"" (a good slower song). The BEST song on here is the slow, ballad: ""Tomorrow"" - Tamia's vocals are on point with this track. It is such a good song.For any Tamia fan: You should own this. For anyone who is looking to explore good R&B; mixed with a bit of hip-hop this is for you!"
5,More than I expected.,"Tamia's voice is just purely angelic, noone has a voice like hers. She's not as huge as other artists because she has a more classy feel to her, not just bubble gum gunk like the others. Favorite song has to be ""Still"" and ""More"" is a close second, but all her songs are beautiful and her powerful and controlled voice is the icing on all the music.This cd will definitely not disappoint you, like her past albums (Nu Day and Tamia (Self-Titled)), this is equally as great if not better."
5,Great CD...Great Artist,"Alrighty...first off...NEVER ever compare Tamia to Ashanti. Ashanti is the worst, ""artist"" of R&B. She has bad material, and even worse CDs. A pretty face can't get you that far. Next...Tamia is awesome. She has been ever since Quincy Jones found her and made her what she is. Tamia has the talent, vocals, heart, material and properly placed clothing, to be bigger than she is. ""Questions"" is by far the best song on Urban radio right now. No, Not because of R.Kelly, but because the record just flows so well and all elements work so well. Since I am a music afficianado, I can safely say that Tamia is the sure thing, and we can only hope to see more and more of her in the future!"
3,Good CD,"I like this CD. The tracks are really catching and I am glad that they finally released her CD! Her company's marketing has been terrible, but the songs are good. I went to the store for weeks looking for it. Officially, Questions, and the one with Gearld Levert blows me away. I love her as a ballad singer and see great things in her future with better representation.Overall, get the CD."
5,More,"Tamia certainly delivered more on this album, what can i say this is one cd i play all the way through on my morning commute. it was a moeny well spent."
5,Underrated,"I really appreciate the path that Tamia has taken. Tamia has simplified the sound of today's R&B genre and even brings in an oldie-but-goodie ""So Into You"" featuring Fabolous (if you remember, Ashanti came into the remix singing the chorus, but there's nothing like the original to make the remix truly a remix, eh?).'More'? An album worth listening straight through...and then some."
5,Fabulous! But where are 15 and 16?,"I am so glad the record company and Tamia took the time to fine tune what will hopefully be her breakout record. This is ALL THAT and MORE. Tomorrow is a gospel smash, Still will be heard at weddings for years to come, and there isn't any filler to be heard on this stellar release. The record buying public has slept on his talented little lady for far too long. Time to recognize!Also, does everyone else only have 14 tracks on their disc? I thought we were supposed to get 2 remixes as bonus tracks. They are not on my CD."
2,Should've been much better...,"After anxiously anticipating the release of this CD, I was dismayed at the lack of quality music on More. I love Tamia, her voice is excellent, one of my absolute favorites, but this CD is replete with Bubblegum Music; rappers, cameos from has-been artists, and a terrible remake of a classic Tamia favorite (So Into You). Though I loved Officially Missing You, I don't understand the tease about the Officially Missing Bonus Tracks. The first and second CDs were definitely 5 stars, but this CD is lacking from start to finish; maybe 3 songs worth putting on repeat, all others could be skipped without missing anything. Though it took a really long time to get this album out, I would have gladly waited another year for something worth listening to."
3,I expected more....but I am still a fan,"Although I really like Tamia as an artist, I feel like this album was not her best work. There is not one song on the album that sounds like a definite hit. The album does not flow well and some of the songs don't sound well vocally. If I had the option to go and buy it again, I don't know that I would, however, I do respect Tamia as an artist and I know that she is capable of quality work."
2,Still Waiting For More!!,"I feel cheated that Tamia album is just a filler. I thought this album was called Still, and what happen to the album cover isn't that a clip from Fabulous video. Why does this album only have about three songs worth listen 2? How could she agree to release some trash like this. I'm sorry but this is trash just like Mario Winans cd(but I do like Mr Cool).I Still waiting for more. I recommend her first 2 release (Tamia and A Nu Day)."
3,Give Me More..........................,"Tamia has one of the best voices in the indusrty these days.Her infectious chops are enough to soothe the soul and make you relate to her music.This album really could be better and better showcase her talents.She is a victim of poor producing and songwriters....The best songs are ""Officially Missing You"" and ""(They Long To Be)Close To You"" and ""Whispers"".The song ""Question"" is ok but could have showcased her voice a lot beeter....another lil R&B; song written by R.Kelly.The song ""Poetry"" is good and this sister pulls it off.""Still"" is a poorly written song and should have been actually left off of written better.""More"" is an alright song...Next time hopefully Tamia could be placed with better songs and writers to actually take her straight to the TOP OF THE CHARTS AND INDUSTRY!!!OVERALL GRADE 75/100 = C"
4,Good Job Tamia,"Not only has Tamia done it again but she has made sure that she keeps her wonderful ratings. People may have forgotten Tamia because she has been gone for a few, having her baby girl, but now that she has released this wonderful cd she at it again. I personally think this is a very good cd. Not one of the best of her cd's but nothing to mess up all the good that she is capable of doing. My personal favorites are, Still, Mr.Cool,Smile and More. The rest are also good. The only problem with this cd I would say that there are too many ""Offically Missing You's"". If you do end up getting this cd you will not be waisting your money, but if you dont already have the rest of her cd's you should also get those to make you collection complete, you will not be disappointed!"
2,NIce CD But...,"Tamia's 'More' doesn't really blow me away. While she is a great singer, Tamia has yet to create an identity of her own, and she is often confused with other talents like Debrorah Cox. There are a few good tracks like 'Officially Missing You', 'Still', 'Questions', 'Whispers', 'Into You', and the outstanding duet with Gerald Levert, 'They Long To Be Close To You', which was originally from his recent CD.Now, if the CD had everything advertised, I'd give it 4 stars, but Elektra failed to include 2 Bonus Remixes they promised. My copy of this CD only has 14 tracks, while the 2 bonus mixes aren't included. This cost the CD 2 stars, and if they wonder why we burn so many CDs, this is a reason why. The companies always give American customers inferior CDs (compared to the international buyers, who often get bonus tracks, etc!). I like Tamia's new CD, but Elektra can kiss my *ss!Peace, SD"
2,Boring,"I thought this was immensely boring. The songs are so quiet, and mostly it's backup singing, and Tamia just sings every few words/lines. She has an okay voice, I guess. but this really put me to sleep. I don't recommend it."
3,Phantom Waltz C Rating from the Lenster,"I did like that one of the main characters was a paraplegic and that the story emphasizes her attractiveness, courage, and capability. It is great to have a story in which a handicapped person is shown as having a full, happy life despite a tragic accident. However, the story was so sugary sweet, that the author lost me about half way through. I was creeped out by the dwelling on orgasms and overdone descriptions of intercourse. It was also highly unrealistic, suggesting that all or most paraplegics can have lives with no limitations whatsoever. It is insulting to those paraplegics who cannot void, who canot climax or bear children, by suggesting that a person needs those things to be fulfilled or happy. I also didn't like that the man in the story was perfect in every way. This book is not one of her best, but overall, Catherine Anderson is a good writer and I enjoy her unconventional relationship books."
4,Actually 4+ - I wanted it to continue,"I trully enjoyed this book. I judge a good book by how I feel at the end, and for this one I didn't want it to end. I wanted to read on and see how Bethany and Ryan lived their lives. Most of us read romance for the fantasy of it; love at first sight, a can do hero that makes dreams come true, etc. This book has that. True some things are not up to fact, but this IS fiction. I do agree with some of the negative reviews, in that the heroine was too helpless for a supposed L2 spinal cord injury. And I doubt Ryan would really be wrestling with a power drive WC with such ease (300+ pounds, I don't think so!) But I enjoyed the romance and fell in love with Ryan early in the book. It was fun and heartfelt!"
4,first of the series,"This was the first of the Coulter family books, about a paraplegic heroine. Very emotional, as are all her books, but the hero was just too perfect to make it a 5-star book. At least she does her handicapped heroines well, making them realistic, and not the usual people who attained sainthood along with their handicaps. Very interesting and frank discussion of sex for a paraplegic."
3,Shadow of a Romance,The dictionary says that a phantom is (among other things) a shadow. In my opinion this books is just a shadow of the kind of romance I like to read. I found Phantom Waltz went a little too far into things parapalegic and found myself skipping pages without finishing the book. Ms. Anderson is a fine writer but sometimes gets too heavy in technicalities. She wrote another story about spousal and child abuse (Shattered Rose?) that went a little too far into gory detail.
2,Just a little too perfect,"""Phantom Waltz"" was the first book that I had read by Catherine Anderson and I to say I'm not sure if I would read anything else by her. I was not 40 pages into the book, when I realized that Ryan (The main male character) was perfect. I mean he was rich, handsome, and the most understanding male on the whole planet. Ms Anderson seem to make light of the fact that Bethany(main female character) was in a wheelchair. We didn't see any deep emotions either of the two characters. In fact, at on point I did stop reading the book and the only reason that I went back to it, was I paid 6.99 for it. If you are a fan of Ms. Anderson you will like, but if you are looking read emotions, go else where."
4,Everyone should read-a reminder of how lucky we all are.,Enjoyable love story that shows us how wonderful life can be and how lucky we all are no matter what life deals us
3,dont buy for the subwoofers,"Bought this with the audiopipe ap3002 amp. Within 5 seconds, the woofers fried.The box itself however is great, I love the frequency response lights and the box provides nice sound. So for the price I payed I think the box itself is well worth it so I just kept it anyway and bought new subs. The only complaint I have about the box is if you need to replace subs like I did it is a huge pain in the ass - way too many screws, and there are spiny factory nuts that are only meant to be used once behind the cardboard that hold the subs that are incredibly difficult to reach and never work the second time anyway so you have to make new holes. Overall however I am very happy with my purchase, i just wish the subs would have been better quality so i didn't have to buy new ones and that the replacement wouldn't be such a task."
1,Secret,"""The Secret"" is still a secret to me because it is the most difficult book to understand! I have participated in a study group for ""A Course In Miracles"" so I am not new to this way of thinking. In my opinion this book is terrible and must be accompanied by a leader who knows what the hell the book is trying to teach you!Sincerely,Laurie Church"
1,This is a dangerous book!,I think this is a dangerous book because it has some truths mixed with lies and witchcraft. Newsweek recently ran an article about the book [...].The author literally believes that you just concentrate your thoughts and you can have whatever you want without having to do any other actions. That's ludicrous!
3,No Secret,"The Secret is to know what you want, be thankful, and feel the emotions and passion that go with it. The universe will answer. All true and said in many other books and tapes. This book is inspirational, but extremely overdone and repetitive. This is a collection of interviews from 30 people who are listed at the back of the book. If you go to their web sites, you must register to look at their products and then will recieve emails asking for donations. How spiritual is that? There is very little practical application in this book.The theory of the book in general is wonderful and better written about by other authors such as Wayne Dyer and Gregg Braden."
1,good for a laugh,"I am amazed that so many people take this seriously. It's a pretty hilarious read, poorly written, and illogical."
2,Powerful premise taken to extreme,"The premise of the book is both empowering and powerful: you are what you think. After discovering this 'secret' Rhonda Byrne goes on a quest to find and bring to us other great minds which used this idea to their advantage. However, in the midst of the intertwined analysis of laws of attraction, positive thinking, and metaphysics, she undermines her own work by taking 'the secret' to a logical extreme - at times, her examples are irrational and meaningless. Miraculous events happen whether you believe in them or not, it's a game of probability, and it is one thing to underestimate this, and a completely another to blindly believe in something you want to be true. If you're looking for a motivational book, there are better ones out there - take a look at Jack Canfield's 'The success principles.'"
1,"The ""Bogus"" Secret",This book is a load of bull. It says over and over you can have whatever you want if you say it to yourself over and over. A phoney crap load and a 1/2.
3,Good motivation,"The reason I give ""The Secret"" only 3 stars is the fact that the author makes it sound like all you have to do is focus really hard on what you want in life and you'll get it. Sure, this is important, but there's more to it. You need to take action! It's not about sitting on your butt and hoping for miracles! Anyway, it's a good book for motivation and definitely worth a read."
4,"Is it a ""Secret""?","I was very curious as to what this book was going to tell me. I went into it ""tongue-in-cheek"". I actually found it very enlightening! Although I'm not sure visualizing money coming to you is going to do it...I DO think the power of positive thinking plays a factor on our lives...maybe the Biggest Factor!"
2,Don't waste your money,"The Secret is not a secret. It is a compilation of ""wisdom"" readily attainable elsewhere in numerous other books or my attending a liberal ""positive thinking"" Christian churches.She simply has copied traditional ""common sense"" material and put it in a book - I call that cheating, but I guess it is an easy way to make money. Since none of the material is young enough to be copyrighted she gets away with it. However there are dozens of books basically saying the same thing. There is nothing different here except a nice looking cover and a decent presentation of the basic thoughts.I suggest you find an indepth class elsewhere with a cohesive philosopy behind it. If you are really curious because someone recommended it, buy it used so you won't be too disappointed. That is what I did and I am passing the book on to someone else who wants to be bored."
1,So much Hype,"I was recommended this book by colleagues and friends.I read through it and realized if one truly follows the suggestions in this book, one is more likely to suffer from delusions than to actually get what they want. I mean how on earth can one imagine that the universe will work toward making our wish come true just because we express it?Common sense would tell us to make the best of our situation. To take life as it comes. being positive works when we see the good of our situation, not worry about what we cannot have and enjoy the present moment for what it is. This book does the opposite. It tells us go all out and wish hard for things we want. To not accept the way things are and to not make the best of things!"
1,Are you kidding me?,"This book is a testament to our need to improve education everywhere. What a joke. I'm not sure what's worse, the book or the people that think this book has anything to offer."
1,Too Confusing for Me!,For some reason I couldn't make any sense of this book. It quickly gave me a headache and I had to stop reading. Even thinking about this book makes my brain feel all twisted up. I've noticed manipulative people tend to put a lot of emotional energy behind vague and confusing words and I think that may be what's going on with this book.
3,OK READ,This book is ok.If its motivation and common sense that you looking to be reminded of then you will enjoy this book it will definetely motivate you.
5,the perfect secret,I have ms and this book was recommended to me by a nurse! Wonderful ideas and sentiments even if you walk away with only one thing: I am in control of my thoughts!I will be giving The Secret for Christmas gifts to all those that I believe are open to it!
3,The Secret ?,"This book is about positive thought and focusing on the good things you want out of life. There is no secret or magic in the book, but it is nice to read motivating passages. However, I did picture myself winning at a casino on my vacation and sure enough I won. So maybe there is a little truth to it."
5,Excellent!,"This book was sold as used. However, if it hadn't been for the Post-it note left on the inside of the back cover, I would have sworn it was never read at all. It was unmarked in any way & stiff like a new book. All for under $5.00! These books sell new for $20 or more. Couldn't be happier. :)"
4,amazing book,This book was indeed a best kept secret. Reading it opened me up to lots of new ways of thinking positive!
4,eye opening,I have enjoyed The Secret very much. I listen to the group speak on Oprah and I waited to purchase anything. I heard about The Secret a few other places and decided to give a try. I really enjoy the cd's because I drive around a lot. I found some of the ideas a bit far fetched but the overall concept makes a lot of sense. I have not had any of my own miracle yet but I am very grateful for the life I have already.
3,Watch the dvd for true inspiration...,"Inspiration to laugh your head off! What a bunch of baloney! The idea is that if you just wish for something hard enough, you will get it. Now, I understand the idea of positive people attracting positive things into their lives,and that's all well and good. However, the so called experts (idiots) in this video are focused solely on material things. They ACTUALLY say that if you keep thinking about a new car you want, it will spontaneously APPEAR in your driveway. I kid you not. The only reason I gave this 3 stars is that it gave me something to laugh at. I'd file this under C - either for Comedy or Crap. Take your pick."
3,entertaining but fluff,"there is nothing wrong with positive thinking and believing in happiness and visualizing good things and all that fun stuff. what i couldn't get over is how selfish this book is. i mean, it is literally about ""me, me, me."" doesn't happiness come from giving and serving and helping others as much (or more than) yourself? it's all fine and dandy to ""attract"" everything you could ever possibly want through your positive thinking. but how about helping others? here's an idea, rhonda byrne can write a sequel: ""the secret: using it to work for others and not just your own selfish desires."""
1,This book is entirely over-rated for all the buzz....,"I have been following the ""New Thought"" metaphysical teachings since two years ago. There has been tons of books written before about the central ideas this book is talking about....so there is absolutely nothing new in this book....therefore it really perplexes me why all the buzz about this book? I mean the over of the book is appealing and the name of the book ""the Secret"" makes people curious what secret it is that they're the only ones who don't know."
1,Repackaged Drivel,This is new and revolutionary how exactly? Would recommend 3 Magic Words by US Andersen over this and it was written in the 50's I believe...
2,nothing new here,Just a collection of pop sayings to effect a positive attitude. Nothing really indepth or startling. Okay for those looking for a bandaid approach-or those who prefer to avoid real reading-unfortunately nothing in this book provides any real guidance or direction. Disappointing.
5,Amazing,"Life changing! I was skeptical at first so I tried to attract small things like the book suggested. It worked right away. It has worked for everything I've tried. Last year we tried to sell our house for nine months. Nothing. So we took it off the market. After reading this book we decided to try to sell it again and it sold in one week. Thank you Rhonda Byrne for spilling the beans and not being able to keep ""The Secret""."
1,what garbage,"this has to be the ultimate in new age garbage. It seems totally geared to modern self centered, completely materialistic people that cannot take any resposibilty for their actions. Not suprising to see it be such a big hit in the states. The secret really throws out some evil themes. I guess people who buy into it deserve it. good luck filling the unfillable void in your life,"
1,Utter Drivel - Perhaps The Stupidest Book Ever,"Chock full of Get Rich Easy, new age garbage (that sometimes verges on the dangerous) that is totally unsupported by scientific evidence."
5,The Secret - Best Book You Will Ever Read,"Excellent, The Secret is the best book I have ever read (besides the Bible). I wish the whole world would read and apply The Secret. I am reading it for the 4th time, it has changed my life."
3,Too repetitious,"I think the concept is phenomenal. I personally have lived this way for most of my adult life. This is probably why, I feel like the book was unneccesarily repetetive. If you may not have heard or used the concept that is drilled into you in this book, you can truly learn something to better your life and circumstances. However, if you already live, breathe and sleep this way, you cannot get into the book because the concept is already known to you. It is interesting that the hype for this book was soo much I bought 2 copies. One for my personal library and the other to share with friends.I must say that my 16 year old liked the book immensley and when he is about to say something negative, I interrupt him and I say ""What does the secret tell you to do"". So in one way it has helped my son realize this way of life and given me vehicle to help him attain it."
2,Not what I thought it would be,"I was so excited to get this book. Although it tells a good message, it repeats it over and over again. Nothing new after the first chapter. I was pretty dissappointed. If you want this book, buy Eat, Pray, Love instead."
2,Not what I was expecting,"So maybe if I had read the reviews I would not have bought the CD set. I didnt know it was a self help thing, I was hoping for a fun story. I listened to it but I dont think I learned anything from it; guess you needed to really want to hear it."
2,The Secret scarcely deserves to be called a book,"Perhaps The Secret could be of help to readers that need a shift from negative to positive thinking. However,many of the naive, inane and largerly unsupported statements that are chaotically scattered around in this so called book, are very quick to thwart the trust, interest and patience of a more serious reader..."
2,Good reminder for positive thinking,"I thought this book was pretty vague, but overall, it will help you understand the Law of Attraction and just how important it is to keep your thoughts focused on what you want to attract. We should all practice positive thinking and use positive affirmations on a daily basis. There's nothing new in this book, but it's a good reminder which we all need every now and then. I do have to add that I think the marketing people behind The Secret did an excellent job in creating a lot of buzz for this book and movie."
4,The Secret,I truly enjoyed the audio book. It is very enlightening . I have passed it on and I am receiving very positive feedback.
5,quick delivery for a great book,thank you! this is a must read for all humans. Please take the time to read this quick book on wisdom and life.
5,Powerful read,This book is amazing! This book is so inspirational and life changing that I've just ordered another 2 editions for my mother and sister as gifts .... and it works!The Secret
1,have owned this book for years. i dont know why,"this book sucks. i put it out for sale each time i have a garage sale, and no one even wants to buy it for 10 cents! maybe i should sell it on Amazon?"
1,If you listen to the advice in this book you will not be happy...,"Make no mistake about it this is yet another ""self-help"" book. It is trying to pose as something mystical but there is nothing mystical about it, just a few peoples philosophy on how to live life. Now that fact on its own is not bad (several self-help books really do help people live better lives) but the content in this book presents -- what I believe to be an incorrect(even destructive) way to look at life. It suggest you always look to what you want to become in the future, and that by doing this you will create your future. But in reality only one person can win the gold medal, and if you spend all your time focusing on it, not only will not be able to enjoy the moments leading up to it, but if you do not win it all that anticipation will destroy you inside. A much better philosophy on life is found in ""The way of the peacful warrior"" I strongly suggest reading that instead."
1,Save your money for bird food.,"It is laughable that I even considered buying this book. I just gave it away without even finishing it. It makes me feel embarassed for the human race, and myself (being the sub-human I am). We must be desperate for a quick answer or just unintelligent enough to succumb to the dumbed-down version of the paradigm shift of science and spirituality. We all knew what this book has said already. Thoughts do have a profound effect on your psyche, ect. Wow. We must have forgotten. Okay, well, time for application, hmmmm?"
4,The Secret Review,"Although I think this book a bit juvenile for anyone that understands the basic Law of Attraction and the very basic in quantum mechanics, it's a nice book for the beginner. Change your thoughts, change your life..."
1,My Item has not arrived,"I've been waiting 3 weeks for my cd's to arrive, and I have not gotten them yet. I check on the website and it tells me its unavilable, but when I ordered the item, there were 20 stock items available. I think this stinks. I like Amazon books and I'd like to remain a customer, but I'm very unhappy with what is going on with my order!!!"
2,The secret is..they're becoming rich by selling you this illusion!,"I had so many expectations about this book,but when I finally got it I was totally dissapointed, at the end I realized that all this ""secret"" boom is just a Huge commercial and marketing campaign created by a bunch of smart guys to sell millions of copies and make millions of dollars with this little bad book,movie, website.don't waste you money, don't make them richer by buying it."
3,The Secret,"The Law of Attraction has already been explained in the Bible; plus each 'author' has written about this in their own books. Nothing new here, but what an amazing marketing machine!!! The idea of having all these well-established, ego-driven authors agree to combine forces, share the stage and profits on a single project is brilliant, add the title's mystique ""The Secret"" and you've got a brilliant marketing campaign ready for the masses.The content of the book however, was mediocre. I was expecting a more organized, thorough explanation of the law, it's daily applications and exercises, but that was left out. But cheer up everyone, there's going to be sequels to the book and DVD explaining the real 'meat' of the secret. Verdict: You can find better books on the topic in this site."
3,The Secret,This was not new information for me so I may not be the person to review this book. But I found the book to be a good discussion of how we create our own world. We are responsible for what happens to us. So it is.
2,The Secret,This is a wonderful book. Clear and concise with chapters organized for various elements of ones life. I have also purchased the video which I found much less helpful.
1,Glad this one is finished.....,"Positive thinking... WE GET IT ALREADY!!! The same information is repeated over and over throughout the book. Basically, the theme is that if you think you already have something, you will get it. Save your money, skip this one."
2,A waste of time,"Yes, I'm all for positive visualization...yes, we can attract negativity by thinking in negative ways, but we cannot get ourselves that car, that house or that job by just thinking you will get it. It's poppycock. What really bothers me about this book is that it is marketed in such a way as to make you think that the contents contain THE secret, how dare the author suggest that she has THE secret to happiness, wealth, health, etc. There is no one secret that can change the world, and to suggest it to people desperate to fix their lives, it's just sad. Great marketing, but still sad. She's making a a fortune by quoting over and over these ""experts"" who claim to have THE secret to all you could want to have a happy life. Try doing some charity work...try thinking of others and stop obsessing over your own life and maybe you'll get some satisfaction. Pick yourself up by your own bootstraps and move forward and leave this book on the bookstore shelf. SAVE YOUR MONEY."
1,First test,"I am applying my first test -- that I and all others that wish this product get it delivered to them free of charge -- not only the book, but tapes and CDs, too. I'm thinking very positive about this, even though you are already believing it is not possible. How do I test the results? It means not another single copy will sell."
2,I am still laughing!,"Think positive thoughts and you will get and be everything you want.You don't have to work for it. It just comes to you. Hmmm....I am winning the lottery.I am winning the lottery. I am winning the lottery. Oops, I supposed I SHOULD go buy a ticket though.Oh, Come On! This is the same stuff we have read for years. Oh, yeah it was all written by the very few who know THE SECRET. I think P.T. Barnum knew the secret and the secret is ""there is a sucker born every minute"", and we bought this book!"
5,Beautiful testament to the human spirit!,"I LOVE this book! Although I must admit I first viewed it as a movie some years ago. It IS and always has been thought provoking as well as a source of motivation for me.It seems that we can always learn something new from the Secret no matter where we are in our awareness. Each time I read it, I learn on a whole new level, and can't help but wonder what I could create if I only practiced it 24-7. There are so many stories that will forever be in my heart! I found that the book was even better than the movie as I was able to take all the amazing information and absorb it at a slower rate.The Secret is a beautiful testament to the human spirit! Thank you very much for sharing it with me."
1,Too fluffy...doesn't touch the deeper meaning,"I am a practitioner of Buddhism and have also studied and read about the Law of Attraction. I had high hopes for The Secret as it was being spoken about by people I thought highly of. After reading it, I found it to be more along the lines of an infomercial rather than an educational or enlightening text. It did not take into consideration the actions of others, the environment, choice, etc. It read as though one should be able to wish things into being instead of working hard and making good choices and forging the plan and path to achieve one's goals. Because I have read so much about these topics, I understood the underlying meaning of The Secret, but this book did a disservice to the subject of the Law of Attraction in my opinion. It was put together in a strange format...again, like an infomercial, and it didn't touch the deeper meaning of the Law of Attraction. This was a piece of fluff with no real meaningful content."
1,Absolutely RUBBISH,"Oops, I just channeled negative energy out there. So I will get rubbish back, my bad.Actually, what ""The Secret"" proves, when it comes to the ""law of attraction"" is true -- stupidity attracts the stupid.That's why stupid secrets generate stupid money. Stupid is as stupid buys ...Gosh darn. I'm being negative again. I need to burn me some more DVD's..."
1,Balderdash,"You too can make millions of dollars by way of blind consumerism and false advertising. The secret is that there is no secret, which you'll find out AFTER you shell out the $$ for this pointless book (or DVD). The content here isn't worth the paper that it's written on."
1,what crap!,"the only ""secret"" is that there is no secret. this book is a marketing ploy-plain and simple. do not contribute to the author's bank account, save your money, and, work hard and honestly for what you need- that's ""THE SECRET"". the book, the author, and her supporters say nothing new, nothing with originality, and, nothing that is truly proven. it is however, very nice kindling for my fire."
5,THE SECRET CHANGED MY LIFE,"If there is one book that you will read in your entire life, make it Rhonda Byrne's The Secret. This book will have far-reaching effects on generations to come. If you want to fulfill all your dreams, make this book your daily companion.The book is very interesting, exciting, inspiring and from personal experience, IT IS TRUE.Learn and master life. If you want to be the best at what you do and be the best, this book will definitely guide you.There are unseen forces working behind what we easily in the world and that world is made available through the work of Rhonda Byrne and other teachers of ""The Secret."" Rhonda Byrne becomes one of the greatest authors of our time by presenting this book on life. To be truly successful in life you must read this book.The book will allow you to explore the infinite possibilities on the universe and it will give you the power to change your life today.Read this book, it definitely is on my TOP TEN."
4,Review of the Secret (book),"Book was fine as far as phsycial appearance, disappointing content, I expected a more organized book. It was just several people having input."
4,Bad Frequencies,"This book makes you think about what you think about. What's your attitude toward life and what you expect. Bad expectations begets bad results. Positive expectations brings more positive outcomes. The old saying: ""the best time to make a sale is right after you make a sale."" This book applies this concept to all aspects of your life.Easier read than applied however."
1,total BS,Utter nonsense designed to appeal to an over self-indulgent society.For the love of God don't be taken in.
2,Disappointing,"Unless you're nine years old and have been living in a tree, this book isn't worth the money. It's nothing more than a slick rehash of what your mother has been telling you for years--that a positive attitude will serve you better than a negative attitude. I intensely disliked the fact that the book stresses materialism; i.e., lose weight and you'll be happy, win the lottery and you'll be happy, or acquire a five million dollar mansion and you'll be happy.But what happens if you don't get what you asked for? Well, the author has left herself a neat little exit hole by telling you that if your wish doesn't come true, it's because you didn't really, REALLY believe it would."
2,Harping and harping,"Albeit the secret is good enough to know all the 200 pages are harping you the same, change your mind to good thoughts. This is very good but the book keeps telling you the same once and again and that makes the book boring. You'll read this book in one afternoon, but is not what I was expecting of it. Maybe this reading will be good for you but is not easy to do what in the book is written."
1,"Astonishingly, jaw-droppingly awful.","If you take this book seriously, get your head examined. One worse than the worst of Coulter."
2,Pennies from heaven.,"The big ""secret"" be positive. Wow what a relief to learn this earth shattering news. You create your our future with you energy--true, but is it that simple? Tell that to the IRS. If you have an IQ under 100, no original thoughts and never swim up stream always down and over with all the other lemurs this book is for you. If you problem is you do think, you do see black and white this book can help you stop all that wasted synaptic activity. Don't worry be happy or is that worry be happy."
1,"Want to know the REAL ""Secret""?","Get your wishes fulfilled only by the thoughts you think?In an alternate fairy-tale world that might be true,but in the real world we wake up in every morning - NO WAY!This book and DVD set is pure New Age NOISE!You want the real ""Secret""?Here it is:If you want it - EARN it!"
1,Can I Give It No Stars?,"This isn't a book, it's a collection of silly bumper stickers. I think its basic premise is even harmful: that we can control what happens to us -- EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS TO US -- with our thoughts. Have a disease? You caused it by negative thoughts. Are you poor? You caused it by negative thoughts. Do you want to be Miss America? Well then, just THINK it, because even if you're a 50 year old, ugly, humpbacked, obese MAN, then you WILL be Miss America, because you send out that Positive Energy into the Universe. What a ripoff. Step right up folks, and fork over your $14.95. You won't be able to make things happen with only your thoughts--but you will definitely help make Rhonda Byrne really, really rich."
1,Where have I heard this before?,"Oh yeah, on the Simpsons.""Greetings, friend! Do you wish to look as happy as me? Well, you've got the power inside you right now, so use it! Send $1 to Happy Dude, 742 Evergreen Terrace, Springfield. Don't delay; eternal happiness is just a dollar away!"""
2,Should stay a secret.,The Secret is that if you buy this book you will make all the author's dreams come through.
3,always take with a grain of salt,"of course, skepticism to things that could help you is the very attitude that the book is trying to discourage.my advice is - have a healthy balance of skepticism and faith. the principles in this book are universal and the book does a great job in reminding us of that. albeit, in a style that's exaggerated that it is almost laughable.they must have paid all those resource person sums of money for them to say those absolutes. and that is, why, you the buyer paid a pretty steep price as well for buying something that's repetitive, preachy and attracts by way of hype and nice paper.bottomline though, did it help the readers? if so, then the book serves its purpose, regardless of how it was written."
2,I finally read it; now the secret is out!,"I am a big advocate for an abundance mentality, and keeping a positive attitude. But the author takes it too literally, insisting that with the right attitude we will never become sick, or can throw away our glasses, or can eat whatever we want and stay thin. Not in my lifetime! Anyway, I gave it 2 stars rather than 1 because I think it can serve to inspire people, and was written in an engaging style."
1,Not worth the paper it's printed on!,"This is a 'stupidfied' version of NLP. I can't believe that all these idiots gave this book 5 stars no wonder America is in trouble. This book talks about wishing for what you want and it'll come true without putting any effort in to it. You just have to believe that you can win the lotto and it'll happen, basically that's the point of this idiotic book. I'm going to let you in a little secret, THAT DOES NOT HAPPEN IN REAL LIFE! Thinking positive is one thing but without putting any work or effort it's just wishful thinking. Trash this book and pick up a book on NLP to really learn how to think positive to reach the goals you want."
1,The Secret,Same old stuff - just rewritten. Sorry I spent the money. Just tell yourself you CAN reach your goals - and skip this book.
3,Questionable,"What is the reason you want this book? If you are looking for a step by step plan - forget it. If you want to read about some interesting people, then this is for you. Sometimes it is just nice to get different perspectives on the same subject - of how did this person feel about it. But this is NOT - HOW DID THEY DO IT!"
1,Secret of Success - Postive attracts Positive & Hucksters attract Marks,"The book restates The Laws of Attraction. The author seems to confuse a huckster New Age theme with the actual law of magnetism which states like poles repel and opposite poles attract. This is the actual 'science' that justifies The Laws of Attraction? The Laws of Attraction is obviously the opposite - positive manifests positive - good things happen to good people.Anyone starving in Africa, living in the terrible conditions of refugee camps, or living in the dangerous conditions of American public housing - are negative people that created their own condition. Beautiful happy people are positive, good people, that deserve their beach house and adoring successful friends. This is a book for easy marks: the vain and vapid."
2,"It was only secret, not the Truth","Some people may be actually lifted up and feel happy and/or happier by being said repeatedly that you can have anything you want, you can have anything you want, and you can have anything you want. That was the secret. But we all know that ""You can not have everything you want by only hoping for it. You have to work hart to get things you want."" This is the Truth. Don't buy this book."
1,The Secret? The book is absolute birdcage lining....,"Ahhhhh, to get flithy rich on the hopes and shattered dreams of the folks that forked over hard-earned money for this sloppy nonsense of a book. The real Secret in life is work hard, tell the truth, don't try to fool people, and then....and only then..... May the Force be with you!!!!"
5,Man you must listen to her !,"simply phenomenal, I""m already gaining the fruits of the amazing teachings. Ow thank you wise one, thank you, thank you.Beside that, it really motivates you, and carries you to change from a negative weak individual to a strong fighter that can grasp the universe between his fingers. There is nothing impossible you are THE! chosen.You won't regret it !. I didn't (^_^)"
5,Moving into the universe,"I first received a copy of the book from the library, being #98 on a list of 136. I have found that I personally need to read each chapter several times and let the words sink in. I keep a notebook of the things I want and believe, know this sounds strange, that I have reached a positive thought basis. I refer to certain chapters whenever I feel I'm wandering away from a positive thought process."
1,Selling False Hope.....,"As a desperate father of two who has recently been layed-off during this burgeoning recession, I wanted to believe anything that gave me hope. My girlfriend suggested The secret. I sat in the bookstore and spent a couple hours reading it. I'm still wondering what the big SECRET is, as if I had missed something crucial. I wonder like many desperate readers, ""am I too thick-headed to buy into this ""law of attraction"" as a cure-all device for the needy?"" Am I too pessimestic that I cannot fully quench the message to make success my reality?I was quite unsatisfied and confused after reading the Secret. Positive thinking should be a state of mind that bolsters our confidence in times of doubt and crisis, not a scheme to arbitrarily take and expect the riches that are not due. This book is hokum and doesn't articulate it's message but rather reiterates it in various phrases. I am dissappointed to say it is a book promoting false hope."
1,"Misleading, no proofs, fake examples","This book is at least VERY misleading,authors give no proofs whatsoever, and it is full of fake examples.It was a marketing hit, and the authors made a lot of money."
1,worthless,"This book was the biggest joke in the world, I mean...what a waste of money. Do yourself a favor, don't buy this and just take my advice...if you want something bad enough or long enough the universe will give it too you... yeah, whatever! I really want a Porcshe GT2, so far the universe hasn't answered me."
1,Not-so-secret Stupidity,"My wife's hairstylist gave her a copy of this moronic drivel, and we had a hoot laughing at it. Apart from that, though, it's a complete waste of time. Most of the ""secrets"" in the book are just recycled New Age nonsense, its claims to antiquity and supposed links to secret societies are purely fictional, and its primary appeal is to greed rather than well being. The ""Law of Attraction"" is simple: Work toward what you want and you might get it. Sadly, this book encourages readers to simply want what they want, which is -- at best -- very poor advice.A related observation: Any time someone claims to have realized a great truth after hitting rock bottom in their own lives, their ""self-improvement"" tips are bound to be either obvious to anyone with common sense or dubious to the highest degree. This book's advice falls primarily into the second category, with smatterings of the first. Good for a chuckle, though."
1,How Easily People Can Be Managed,This book is proof that people can be led to believe anything. Try to find any concrete thing in this book and you will find yourself lost in a lot of colored smoke. It's another well architetured project to become rich. And it really worked. Congratulations to the creator.
4,The Secret,"I found this book to be very insightful and uplifting. I don't know what all the controversy is about though with regard to spiritualism. Any one who has ""faith"" will realize that these theories can be based on the teachings of the bible very easily. Because they are not written that way it does not mean they are not implied."
4,worth reading,"THIS BOOK IS WORTH THE TIME TO SIT DOWN FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS AND TRY TO INJEST..THE SECRET, I FEEL WOULD VERY HARD TO KEEP ALL NEGTIVE THOUGHT OUT OF YOUR BRAIN..THEY SLIP IN UNWANTED, WHEN WE LEAST EXPECT THEM.GOD GAVE US FREE WILL AND I BELIEVE THAT IS PART OF IT.I WOULD TELL YOU TO BUY A COPY AND JUDGE FOR YOUR SELF."
4,The Secret (Rhonda Byrne),An encouraging book with a very uplifting and hopeful message. Easy to read and much to think about.
5,life changing book,I recomend this book to everybody and I'm telling all my family and friends to buy it because i will never give up my copy!!!! Read this book! It doesnt go against anybodies belief system or religious preference...its a beautiful life changing book! Priceless!
1,What the?,"This is not the book I thought it would be. I consider this book to be more of the ""self help"" kind. I bought the book thinking it would be more thought provoking than it turned out to be."
1,Whatever...duh,"Est, the program, Mary Ann Williamson... got your money yet?This one will too.Life isn't that simple, is it?"
1,psycho-babble?,"I listened to this book at the behest of a friend who promised that my eyes would be opened to the secret of the universe. Having tired of reading psycho-babble thirty years ago during my college days, I tried to respectfully decline, but gave in and bought the audio. ""The secret"" is this: your vibes are magnetic and you will attract like minded mental magnets, and the riches of the universe will be yours. Never mind that the basic premise defies the immutable laws of physics, i.e. in magnetism, opposites attract; the mindless blather never lets up for the full four and one half hours of the book. This book is living proof that people with nothing to say never tire of saying it."
1,not my cup of tea,"its almost like a self-help book, or is it simply just that exactly? those tips i already know and i think everyone knows. what to do, when to do, how to do, the problem is WE JUST DONT DO IT. thats humanity right? this book is almost like a therapist talking to me. didnt like it."
4,I Recommend The Video Series As Well....,"We must first change our attitudes before anyting in life changes....The mind is the biggest obstacle in beginning/completing a new goal...Although I don't agree with all the spiritual dialogue in the book, I still would recommend reading...Author OfBlack Women Deserve Better"
5,Happiness is yours,"Since receiving the book, my attitude and life is so much better. Daily I read something from this book. I have become a calmer person. Things that would easily anger me seem unimportant now. Life is to be enjoyed, that is a choice we can make, it is ours for the asking. Thank you Rhonda Byrne. The video is awesome also!"
1,HOW DO I GET A HUMAN TO LISTEN TO ME?,"I ORDERED THIS BOOK USING A COUPON. THE BOOK WAS SENT TO AN OLD ADDRESS AND RETURNED TO AMAZON. YOU SENT ME AN EMAIL TELLING ME THAT YOUR WERE SENDING A CHECK SINCE THE BOOK COULD NOT BE DELIVERED. BUT YOU STILL DID NOT LET ME CORRECT THE ADDRESS. SO NO BOOK, NO CHECK, NO WORD FROM NUMEROUS EMAILS SENT TO AMAZON. HELP! I'M LOST IN CYBERSPACE!"
3,Good Advice Warmed Over,"The Secret is a simplified play on numerous other books on the results of positive thought. In that it is easy reading and can be reviewed quickly for a reminder, it is worthwhile, but nothing new, nor groundbreaking."
1,Did you see the Video?,"If you saw the video, don't bother with the book. Or vise versa. The book is just the same content as the video in text form. I was expecting more information, thought it would go deeper into each topic, but it's exactly like the video...It reminded me of those books with a read along tape kids have.If you're looking for more content, look to a different author. If you want a quick reference guide, then this is the one for you."
2,Found it not as good as I hoped,By far this is not the best CD I have heard on this topic. I think that too many intruptions when intoducing each speaker. And the accent of the author I found to be very distracting. I do not recommens this
3,A grain of salt...,"So African Americans suffered hundreds of years of slavery when they could have just thought themselves out of it? An abused child can envision a loving home and it will manifest? What about all of the people who suffer from mental illness? I get what proponents of 'The Secret' are trying to do. However, one must consider the societal factors that affect all of us and realize that there are many circumstances that are uncontrollable. Additionally one must consider physical or other related limitations. For example, I can visualize myself winning American Idol, but it will never happen because I can't sing! I can envision myself as a prima ballerina, but it will never happen because I can't dance! My son will never be a jockey because he is too big. It is common sense that you should strive for what you want, but also realize that things don't just magically happen and there is a concrete reality that is not subject to your fancies."
5,Moving From The Secret to A Higher Level of Consciousness,"I first saw the video The Secret in October 2006. Shortly after that I bought the book here on Amazon.com. I was inspired to write a book myself to take The Secret to another level. I used THE SECRET to create the next generation book about the Law of Attraction. The Law of Attraction led all the right people to me to make this new book a reality. Within 3 months the book was completed and ready for publications. Three weeks after completing the book, it is already available on Amazon.com. That is THE SECRET in action!Bruce Goldwell, co-author ""Mastery of Abundant Living"""
2,Very disappointed!,"This book does not live up to the hype it has received. There was no ""a-ha"" moment ... just a bunch of ""see it, believe it and it will come."" Yeah ... right!!!"
1,Infantile Babble,"What a heaping pile of crap. The ideas presented in this book are only appropriate for children to believe. Anyone with an IQ over that of a gerbil will find this book (and its author) just plain silly and actually a hinderance to any kind of positive transformation in their lives. I mean, how can you treat a book seriously that believes you won't get fat if you don't look at fat people?"
3,North Carolina Review from a Southern Girl,"I recently listened to the DVD and enjoyed many parts of it; however, through God all things are possible not through ""The Secret""."
1,Blasphemous,"This is blasphemy. The CLEAR, UNQUESTIONABLE TRUTH is given by God Himself in the Holy Bible."
3,Ouch... on the shipping costs.,"The product was an easy read. Although I don't completely believe in a lot of the opinions in the book, it does have some optimistic things in it to improve the way you see things and your way of life. Looking back I'm sure I could have found this book cheaper in a book store as the shipping costs were way to high. I did upgrade my shipping to expedited, but it was not worth it as it maybe saved me a day or so in delivery! Even then the regular shipping costs were only about $2.00 less which was still to much. If you plan to order this product make the shipping worthwhile and order a few different things and bundle your order to help offset the shipping costs. Book came on time as requested, which when I received the date via e-mail I thought it was to long for shipping. Also came in good condition."
2,The Secret,I found the book difficult to read and hard to keep my attention. I've read many books similiar and better. THE GAME OF LIFE AND HOW TO PLAY IT by Florence Schovel Shinn. Is much better and very easy to read.
2,Try QUANTUM SUCCESS by Sandra Anne Taylor!,"The Secret is edited more than written. It offers a few good principles, but it's just the beginning. If you really want to get to the meat of the science and the experience of success and happiness, try QUANTUM SUCCESS by Sandra Anne Taylor. The few moments of ""Aha!"" you may experience from the so-called secret will turn into a lifetime of revelation (and real results) when you read QUANTUM SUCCESS. That book is where the real secret is revealed!"
5,Great & easy read that can change your life.,"I swear by this book, it sits on my desk at all times. It's a must have, I highly recommend it."
1,How much has Rhonda Byrne's given to charity?,"One would think that a person of the spiritual integrity as Rhonda Byrne's would gladly donate some of her huge profits to charity, yet a Google search turns up zilch.Positive thinking is great, but this is pseudo scientific, narcissistic, materialist, greedy, self-centered, deluded, manipulative, nonsense. Rhonda Byrne fools the gullible for their money - she isn't spiritual in the slightest."
1,Utter Nonsense,"I bought this book, took it home, started reading it but couldn't get past the first few pages. Pure nonsense! Thankfully I was able to return it for full refund. The Secret is drivel to the max and that is no secret."
1,Claptrap,"I cannot but agree with a recent review by Carol Travis in the TLS that the author's SECRET is <that if you are poor, unhappy or jobless, the fault lies not in your stars or your circumstances but in your thoughts>.To all those who gave this book a positive review, I recommend Barbara Ehrenreich's recent book titled Bright-Sided: How the relentless promotion of positive thinking has undermined America."
1,Nothing New Here,"In my opinion, The Secret is just another ""PMA"" book. Although there are good things to be said about positive thinking, there really wasn't any new insight or information here.(The reviewer was compensated for posting this review. However, the opinion stated in the review is that of the reviewer and the reviewer alone. Further, the reviewer independently selected this product to review and has no affiliation with the product maker/distributor, Amazon or the review requester.)"
5,I love it!,"Wonderful book. I believe that if I truly learn how to show and feel grattitude, then this will improve my life greatly."
4,High Impact Book,It's a great read and can be life changing if you buy the premise. Easy to read and good to refer back to.
5,a nice self-development book,"Ask any successful person, whether in business or life in general, and they'll tell you that the Secret is very real. Doctors know that attitude has a lot to do with a patient living or dying during surgery.This is an important message and it has been done in a great way. Yes, it talks a lot about money, but there are also sections about relationships and health. It is not all about collecting material goods. The people who say that don't get it. It's about creating your life. If you want to collect a bunch of stuff, go with it. People who really get the Secret know that this is much bigger than ""stuff"" though."
1,Here is the real secret,"This book is perfect for welfare mothers that buy lottery tickets.The real secret is that she is selling skunk water and making a killing because dumb morons drink this stuff up.This book emphisizes one of Covey's 7 Traits of Highly Effective People. ""Visualize acheiving your goals.""It then goes on to tell you to have a positive outlook.But the author tries to get you to believe this is a mystical secret.The entire book is trash. Hope this saves the reviewer the price of the book.This book fails to mention that successful people get off there butts and work to make their dreams happen. -key word is ""work""-Success is 10% inspiration and 90% perspiration.I know this because I have a masters degree in science."
4,Good for open minds,"The value of reading this book is not in believing every individual assertion made. Instead, it's the ""big picture"" that makes sense. Essentially, it says that ""what we pour our effort into, we bring""...the power of positive thinking. If you don't like some aspect of your life, and all you do is complain about it and worry about it and think about it, nothing will change. But if you can find a vision of what you truly desire, put yourself in a mindset that you are there, and even act like you have what you are looking for, then ""the force of the universe"" will help you help yourself to acheive. There are plenty of anecdotes. Some of them are too conveniently easy and grand for me to swallow. All the same, I liked the overall message. However, don't mistake it for a ""self help"" book. It's interesting and can give you some perspective, but it's heavy and theory but weak on strategies. I think it's up to the reader to find your own strategies to make to concept work for you."
1,Constructive Reveries And Positivity,"This ""secret"" is utter nonsense. Not only is it historically inaccurate, it claims a power acted for people when the real ""power"" was to have enough courage to try. It claims that you attract the bad things that happen to you. I say this is cruelty, especially to ill people who believe with all their hearts that they'll get better, but when they get worse, this video says it's their fault. Why can't we believe that brilliant people like Cicero, Einstein, Mozart, and others were brilliant because they were brilliant, not because they were trying to hid the Secret from us?You can get all the worth from the film in this word: try. If you have a brilliant idea, go with it! If you have undying desires, try to accomplish them! The rest of this Constructive Reverie And Positivity is claiming power where it doesn't belong."
2,The secret,This book was o.k. I never got to finish it since it never really grabbed my attention. The concept is good but not enough details to justify the ideas listed.
3,Nothing new here,"This information has been out there for years and years and regurgitated ad infinitum in different books, movies, journals, and new age movements. Worth a read if you have never been exposed to the law of attraction, but read it with a balanced perspective."
3,book was choppy and repetitve,love the concept but dissapointed at the lack of deapth many better reads on the topic pf The Law of Attration
1,"The Pinata God (Ahem, I Mean 'Universe')","God is a pinata. Naive optimism is the broom stick. This book (less than $20) removes your blindfold, so you can get candy, cars and supermodel dates to fall from heaven (ahem...I mean...the ""universe""). Tell that to the teenager dying of stage IV cancer, the mom whose child is strung out on dope, and the guy whose job just got out-sourced to India. You have to be dumber than driftwood to believe any of this junk, let alone to pay $15 to have Rhonda prey upon your wishes for a better life. The sequel should be ""Psst...You're REALLY Dumb for Buying More Snake Oil"". Ask Rhonda how much $$$ from her millions in book sales she donates to charity? After all, the 'universe' stands ready to re-fill her bank account. Right???"
1,"There's no place like home, there's no place like home","Save your money. This book has little or no value.Yes, thoughts do produce wealth, happiness and whatever you want out of life. But its not a straight line. The missing variable is action.You have to act in order for those things to happen. Its important to resist negative thoughts, as negative thoughts result in negative actions/positive thoughts result in positive actions. Negative thoughts=unhappiness. Positive thoughts=contentment. But the theory that you can think positive thoughts and magically things will come to you, is the same as clicking your heels together 3 times and saying: there's no place like home, there's no place like home, there's no place like home and suddenly you're in Kansas."
4,the secret,"I think the book is okay for those looking for positive reinforcement, but i dont think you have to read it to know ""the secret"" ie the fact that whatever you reflect will be attracted to you, so goes for positive and negative thinking as well. The trick is, how to stop putting yourself down, and stop deprieving of all the things you deserve. Its easy to think positive in good times tho, but what about when things go wrong? I dont think a book can tell you that, what u need is to have faith within. So what youre really looking for wont find in a book, but in yourself. This book wont make u happy, you will. Thats the real secret."
2,the secret,"Video much easier to grasp, although it should be watched several times. The book is like slogging thru a pedantic article."
3,It's all about the marketing,"The real genius of this book is in the marketing and packaging. The Secret has created incredible buzz. (A couple of plugs on Oprah never hurts, either!) In any event, the information in this book is far from new, but it's packaged in a way that's easy to digest. If you're into positive thinking and the law of attraction, The Secret offers some fresh perspective in an easy read. As a marketing case study, the secret to The Secret is all about the buzz."
1,Here's the Secret - Worst book ever published.,"The Secret is the worst book ever published. The Secret is also the worst DVD/television programme ever made. It is worse than lowest common denominator - It is Divide by Zero error.What is the secret ? - there is no secret.It is all fluff and filler and no facts.The TV show is 2 hours of nothing to break up the commercials.If you like to be handed everything on a plate very slowly, and then get to the end and find out it was all building towards nothing then you are going to love this.The production values are slick, but the message is empty and trivial to the point of non-existance.Your life is too short."
1,Flawed concept,"How can you respect a book that posits thinking of things so that you attract them as a ""secret"" when it uses an untrue and unscientific analogy?Opposites attract and likes repel. Look it up before you waste time on this latest example of get-rich-quick snake oil."
1,Narcissisticly Distorted View,"Is how I would summarize my take on this one. I wouldn't give it to my kids as it sets the wrong value expectations. There are a few redeeming parts where ever so briefly there is a touch point with spiritual or scientific depth. If you are seriously seeking don't waste your time on this one. I thought of donating the it to my local library, but I actually threw it in the garbarge."
3,Common sense,"Being possitive is good advise and I agree with much of what was written.ButI think this carries it too far.Thinking about a parking space won't get you one. And if you do find one it is only because no one else parked there YET and not because you thought it. Now taking action to find one by driving around will find one. So the bottom line is the action you take to get what you want will in many cases get it, not the thought of getting it."
1,"Recycled, Repackaged, Remarketed for the 21st Century","...this is nothing more than ""wishing makes it so"" and ""the power of positive thinking"" reworked and repolished for the new millennium. The book's a bestseller, thanks-to-and-shame-on slick marketers and celebrities like Oprah. That's the best advice, and the real truth behind ""The Secret"" right there - write your own self-help book, gain a following, get rich, and your dreams will come true too. Don"
4,Good Read,"I enjoy reading anything about the Law of Attraction, Law of Desire, and Law of Pure Pleasure. It is an upbeat way of life that recognizes the power of self-fulfilling prophecy. Basically, according to the secret, you shape your future by your thoughts. I found the book ""Shortcut to a Miracle,"" by Michael Rann easier to read.For more specific details on making money, you may want to read ""The 17 Principles of Creating Wealth,"" by Phillip Collinsworth."
4,I can grap this principle...,"This principle is easy to grasp and uses basic thought ideas to generate positive thinking. Obviously the negative reviewers are not utilizing the principles in the book. Yes, I found many comments a stretch but the basic overall premise, if adopted by the mass population, would be a great asset to society. This book parallels biblical thoughts and practices in many respects. Unfortunately, the direct relationship to biblical scriptures would label this book 'religious' and would not sell as many copies. If you are a Christian, relate what is in the book to what is found in the bible. I plan to study and practice this principle this summer and see what happens. Bottom line - If you utilize one thought in this book and come away with one good idea, it is worth it."
1,This is not a copy of the original material and I am sorry I bought this...,"This not the same as the original and it leaves out some of the ""how to"" aspects and examples.I regret that I purchased this item. I bought this for a gift which I won't give now.It is not the same as the original and I didn't realize it before I purchased.I made the mistake of getting the video too and that is also a revised edition.My suggestion is to save your money and get the original Edition on Ebay.I am really disappointed in these revised items, especially since the original was so very good."
3,Interesting,Good perspective on taking control of your life through thought and feeling. A good read for anyone looking to improve their outlook on life.
5,The Secret To A Wonderful Life,"What a truly amazing book! I couldn't put it down AND couldn't stop talking to people about it! Those who were already aware of 'The Secrets' existence agreed wholeheartedly how positive and uplifting it is and those who hadn't yet been introduced to this life altering lesson in life found the enthusiasm in others over this book infectious!'The Secret' teaches you how to be you, how to live life at one with the universe and how to be truly happy, it's mindblowingly amazing!!!"
5,helpful book,"this book has been very helpful when i'm feeling down. i like to read this book when i'm going through rough patches, and it always helps me get back on track."
2,Nothing new here.........,"There is nothing new under the sun, as someone once wrote. The SECRET is a concept which has been written about for atleast the last 50 years.So this is a new edition for the latest audience.Read THE POWER OF POSITIVE THINKING and you get the same idea.Read the BIBLE and it's all in there.No hocus pocus, no secret, no magic.........you make your choices, you make your life.In many cases, you play the hand you're dealt.One door closes, another door opens......it's hell in the hallway.Life goes on.There are no easy fixes or magic pills.Any gain takes work and attention.You cannot sit back, read this book and wait for your life to happen perfectly for you.You need to take action and move in the direction of your dreams.Are you all that simple?!Oh dear.....who said: "" Hydrogen and stupidity are the two most common elements in the universe.""!"
4,"They are making a very poor job of keeping The Secret, a secret!","This is an outstanding program. Not new, but newly presented and packaged in a way that reaches more people, more effectivelyI'm a firm advocate for The Law of Attraction, and this audio program is just great.If you are still 'thinking' about whether to buy it or not.STOP thinking and get into action. You won't regret it.I only gave it 4 stars because I'm sure that there is more and better to come!"
1,Don't throw away good money,"It appears that, according to this woman, the almost 3000 innocent people who perished in the 9/11 attacks wished it upon themselves. Also, cancer is your own fault, and all the bad accidents that befall you are your own doing. This is the only conclusion I can draw from her scatter-brianed misinterpretation of the pseudo-science of positive thinking. Still want to buy the book?"
5,It has changed my life in the most positive way,"If you read this book with an open mind and heart, it will work, because it's all facts. It's not a dogmatic book, read it, put it into practice and see the results yourself.Even if you feel that not everything is working as it says in the book, there are enough lessons in it that will make it worth reading.Personally, it has opened me to a happier, more relaxed and generous life. It has improved my relationships with the people around me, I'm achieving every goal that I set for myself and so much more."
3,The Secret of Toto ...,"Yes, it was Dorothy who wished as hard as she could, repeating the magic words, ""I think I can, I think I can ....""Wait! That was the Little Engine That Could. Or could it, really?Dorothy said, in repetitious manner, while clicking her heels together, ""There's no place like home, there's no place like home ..."" thus escaping the land of Oz.This was well before her drug addiction.But was the secret the words, or the clicking heels?Was it the drugs ... ?Or was it all locked up in the mind of Toto?These and other deep thoughts can be yours for less than $15."
1,"Think of good books only, so you dont have to read crap like this.","I must have been thinking about reading terrible books, because I ended up reading this garbage. The short version is this, ""What ever you think, good or bad, becomes real. Now here are 500 examples that we need as filler for this ""book""."" I just saved you an afternoon, you're welcome."
1,The WORST BOOK I have ever read,"This is the worst book I have ever read. Thank God I borrowed it from a friend and didn't spend a cent on this money-making plot. Save yourself the money and the wasted time. Here is the secret: whatever you think about will happen to you. Think good things, get good things. Think bad things get bad things. The end. The book has no structure, no real chapters, just weird paragraph after weird paragraph saying the same thing over and over. Was there an editor involved? It doesn't appear that there was. It is completely incoherent. Does anyone quoted have a college degree? It sure doesn't seem like it.Law of Nature? What are you talking about?The sad thing is that people are buying this book and the author has become rich. Wait, maybe there is something to this ""secret"". All she had to do was think ""I will write the world's worst book and people will buy it and I will become rich"" and it happened!"
1,The Secret is that it stinks,"Honestly, I didn't even make it past the 25% mark in this book. It sounded interesting at first but it's like some of the other one-star reviewers have said: it's like an infomercial. Oh, and here's The Secret -- if you think good thoughts, good things will happen to you. Okay, I actually do believe in positive thinking, but let's not fool ourselves into thinking that we're going to win the lottery just because we keep having thoughts about this happening. Yep, that's the whole book, a bunch of testimonials from those who are already successful and claim it's because of The Secret."
3,I don't get it!?,"The book's ONLY premise is the ""law of attraction."" --If you think positive thoughts, then the law of attraction will ensure that positive results will follow-- Wow! Now that's profound?! The text is loosly written and really just an essay with large font and quotes scattered around. I do rather enjoy some of the quotes by Winston Churchill and Albert Einstein, but none of it is earth-shattering. Maybe I already knew the ""secret"" and didn't even know it?! In any event, I gave it 3 stars because I didn't want to throw it in the trash or re-gift it to my brother-in-law. Its a VERY light read!"
3,The Secret that will not change your life...,"Anybody who thinks that reading this book will instantly change his/her life is, allow me to let you in on a little secret, Wrong. The book is well meaning and attempts to positively influence our thought process and how we veiw the world. Under most circumstances positive thinking can positively influence our day to day lives; however, as many other critical reviews point out, our thoughts can't be exclusively held responsible for what happens to us.The Secret is an easy read but should not be taken too seriously. If it was as simple as the Secret outlines we could all sit around our house, have positive thoughts and simply receive what we ask of the universe. Wouldn't that be nice."
5,What a Great Secret!,"Both my husband and I have watched this movie. The book is identical to what is presented in the movie, so it's just a matter of preference (book vs. movie watching) It is well done and we have both gained some great ideas on how to stay on a positive path, (the gratitude rock is one such example) and how to get out of the cycle of ""negative griping"" that comes with getting older.I recommend this movie (or the book) to anyone who has decided to make a personal effort in improving their present outlook on life. Much of what is presented is common sense, however we all need reminders, from time to time, on how to stay on the path of positive thinking. I think EVERYONE should see this movie at least once.-S. Mack7-8-07"
3,The Secret is ok...,"The book is a great attempt at inspiring everyone to think positively. However, I think is it a bit realistic...How can we get anything we want by simply thinking so.??"
3,The Secret,"The concept of the book is great and true. Positive attracts positive, mind over matter kind of thing. For me it was hard to read. For some of my friends they read the book in a matter of hours. So it's just a matter of personality. Good thing there's a video that is sold also. The one thing I can tell you is that strangers have come up to me to me tell me how the book has changed their lives. And this is just by them seeing me read the book. So take what you want from that. Cheers!"
3,Not really a Secret,"I did find some valuable insight from this book, as well as some interesting stories. I think the ""Secret"" is not necessarily a singular thing that one can peg, but a result from a variety of positive things that one does to improve their life and getting great results. The title brings about a feeling that some think perhaps this is some kind of revelation of sorts, and I suppose if you just found a way to unlock a lot of positive potential within yourself, then it could be taken as such. I was a bit removed from the examples used in some ways, it seems material possessions such as a car or some other toy you would treat yourself with were used to the point where it makes material possessions seem nobler to attain than anything else."
3,I think the DVD would be better,"The content of the book is nothing new -- the ideas are in the same vein as your basic new age/new thought/meditational stuff, but the way the ideas are organized and simplified is good for most readers, I would think. The book, however, seems to be a transcription of the video, rather than a narrative. And that style is awkward on the page. I saw a short clip of the dvd and I would recommend watching it over reading it. I do recommend The Secret, though, because although you may already have an understanding of the fundamental concepts, it's always good to have a reminder."
1,The Biggest Con Ever,"I loathe the day this book got published. Ever since this book got printed I have been hearing about it nonstop. Oprah, my friends, family members, etc. This book is a total piece of crap. And yes, before you criticize me for not reading it, I saw the movie and that was all of ""The Secret"" I needed. It's a hoax people, wake up! This book takes things that are true from different philosophies and religions and markets it into a pop-culture piece of rubbish!I hate, hate, hate this book."
4,Good for open minds,"The value of reading this book is not in believing every individual assertion made. Instead, it's the ""big picture"" that makes sense. Essentially, it says that ""what we pour our effort into, we bring""...the power of positive thinking. If you don't like some aspect of your life, and all you do is complain about it and worry about it and think about it, nothing will change. But if you can find a vision of what you truly desire, put yourself in a mindset that you are there, and even act like you have what you are looking for, then ""the force of the universe"" will help you help yourself to acheive. There are plenty of anecdotes. Some of them are too conveniently easy and grand for me to swallow. All the same,I liked the overall message. However, don't mistake it for a ""self help"" book. It's interesting and can give you some perspective, but it's heavy in theory and weak on strategies. I think it's up to the reader to find your own strategies to make the concept work for you."
1,One word: HYPE,"OK I have some other words: repetitive, nonsense, did I say repetitive? I put this on the shelf with my pet rock."
5,awesome,"This really puts things in order. A must read for anyone. If it doesn't come to you right away your not ready, give it time.It really does work."
5,The Secret,"One of the best books I've ever read. I've read it more than once, and I highly recommend it to everyone."
5,Improving your life,"I already had a copy of this book. I bought extras for people who might be interested in improving their lives. It doesn't matter if you're religious or not, this book will help you with your goals and wants."
2,be positive but don't stop working at it,"I do not agree with the message this book generates ""you don't need to try, just think"".I agree one should be positive to attract positive, but effort is still required in every aspect of life. Get real :) (smiley face)"
3,"Tough one to grade, worth the read but lady is a scam....","I am so torn, at the end I would buy and read the book, its short and to the point. But, I do agree with the slams too, the book is a scam. It is BRILLIANTLY MARKETED, and kudos on the name (catchy). But the book is very short and could actually be a lot shorter. Almost not long enough to be called a book, tho I enjoyed it and would buy it as a gift for others. I just want to say the author is brilliant for making millions on almost nothing, tho..."
2,Another Social Aspirine and temporary fix...does not cure the main problems in life,"Thinking positive, being positive ...while ignoring the natural laws and systems of persistent effort, innovation, focusing on your life goals and hard work are simply good hopes without substance. I felt I was insulted when I read about this guy who was expecting to receive checks in his mail box ....I think will wish that for next month too..instead of receiving my water and energy bills on my mail inbox :)There are some natural laws and principles you can not go against...you can try to cheat life but in the end you receive what you pay for. You can hope to win the lottery and spend a lot of money in it , or you get yourself a better education , being more proactive in your work , organize to build a business...that is you choice. But dont try to sell me the idea that thinking positive alone will solve all problems in life because it simply does not work that way."
5,Great While Driving,"""Secret"" by Rhonda Byrne is a book that is best read many times over. Each time I read or listen to the keys and helps in this book, I learn something new. By getting the CD, I use my ears to input the information rather than my eyes."
1,The Secret DVD,I still have not received the DVD on The Secret. I would like my mony back. It has been too long. I ordered it last month. Thank you
4,"""An Attractive Secret""","The cover interested me, I have read and re-read the book many times highlighting as I read.Pros:* easy to read, no jargon* different points of view on the same subject, addresses different situations with a common thread.* pictures and graphics are eye- pleasing.Cons:* addresses the more passive side of the law of attraction* little emphasis on actions"
5,Want to make some adjustments in the way you think?,This was an incredible book and very inspiring. If you are looking for postive change in your life than this is the book for you. The book helps you realize the importance of postive thoughts and how a slight adjustment in the way you think will make difference in your life outcome. I was very impressed and to this day still applying the things I've learned in this book to my everyday life. Highly recommended - especailly if you are feeling down on your luck.
3,discover the secret...,"heard about ....suggested by a friend at a workshop. Lot has been said about it and book only has ramdom ideas not really sugestions .it could be a begining to explore the idea in the book,helpful somehow to open your curiousity to explore the secret inside..."
1,Fell for the hype.,"Opps, I feel for it again!! Another Oprah recommendation. This book reads like it was written by an eight year old, a slow eight year old. It just says the same thing over and over and then finds twenty experts to say the same thing over and over. Ill save you some money and tell you the secret, your about to lose 15 bucks."
1,Platitudes and gibberish,"Positive thinking? OK. Positive attitude. OK.That's about it. The rest is just new age gibberish told by psychics and motivational gurus. It's almost as bad as ""What the bleep do we know""."
1,Oversimplifies everything,"Those sincerely interested in the topic should read Esther Hicks and the Abraham material. This book (and movie) throws in a lot of spiritual greed and great-sounding delusional thinking. It is like someone preparing a meal starting from a great cook, but then adding tons of sugar, salt and MSG so that the basic health has disappeared."
1,I did not like it.,"It is a combination of short stories, to encourage you to think well, not a secret."
3,The Power of Positive Thinking by Norman Vincent Peale - REPACKAGED,"Hey, good ideas are good ideas. I have read this book and the Power of Positive Thinking by Norman Vincent Peale and other than some spit and polish and a bit more spin The Secret is just a repackaging of that product. I don""t say one is better than the other, just that The Secret comes across as a bit more mystical. Plus I noticed in a recent story on CBS news the authors refused to be interviewed when they noticed the story was focusing on the similarities of their book ideas and that of Norman Vincent Peale's Original book.The Power of Positive Thinking"
1,I was upset by the King interview,"Larry King did an interview with one of the people instrumental in ""The Secret"" project. King asked him about people ""attracting"" consequences to themselves (through vibes or some such hocus pocus). King specifically asked the guy if Jessica Lundsford attracted her murderer. The Secret guy answered that each of us attracts our own outcomes and that there are NO exceptions. This is just plain upsetting and callous in view of what happened to that child. I will skip ""The Secret. Bad ""vibes."""
1,Spiritual justification for greed,This is just like the prosperity gospel that a lot of Protestants embrace. This justifies selfish spirituality. I guess it is good if you are really shallow and selfish.
2,Why pay $23.95 for common sense?,"Am I the only one who thinks that the stuff in here is mostly common sense? Focus on the positive, and you can change your life for the better? (Not that this premise works all of the time.) This seems to be a rehashing of ""ideas"" that fill the self-help section at any Barnes & Noble or Borders bookstore. Save your money--there's nothing revolutionary here."
1,It's no secret. Stroll through the self-help section of a bookstore.,"It is hilarious and a bit sad that this book and video are taken so seriously.Touting a conspiracy that the rich and powerful and the religious mystics have kept this ""secret"" from the unwashed masses for millenia, our heroine Rhonda Byrne declares she is suddenly unleashing its miraculous power on the world. Replete with Da Vinci Code-esque graphics and anecdotal stories of magical results bestowed on practicioners, the crux is this: Think positive! Have positive thoughts and positive things will coming flying at you! Be positive! If it doesn't work, you're not thinking positive enough!This is essentially Norman Vincet Peale wrapped in Tony Robbins couched in Kenneth Copeland by way of Napoleon Hill masquerading as Dan Brown. All of which have been publicly available (with no monastic assassins guarding them) for your entire life at the used bookstore for 50 cents a pop."
1,Absolutely Horrific,"I listened to the audio version of this book, and I am VERY glad my friend purchased it and not me. This book is just horrible in every conceivable way. Its based on the basic principle that if you put out positive thoughts, it brings positive things into your life. Many religions teach this is one way or another.This books takes it to new levels. You can ""think"" yourself rich. You can ""think"" hot women into your life. As if women are objects to be had? What kind of spirituality is that?This book is for people who are all about themselves and are obsessed by material things, this book is NOT for those wanting spiritual enlightenment."
1,This is a unfortunate read,"In a nutshell this is the health wealth and prosperity movement for human secularist. The writing is full of fatal contradictions and faulty logic, and I would honestly have to say that author and the contributors are preying on the weak."
1,Embarassing and scary,"I can't believe there are enough people out there giving this book positive reviews that the overall rating is 3.5 stars.That truly scares me about the state of affairs in this world.I have to admit, I only read 20 pages of this book. People I knew were reading it, so I picked it up and was shocked at how embarassinglyinsulting it was to my intelligence.I'm no Einstein, but this is targeted at people way down the intellectualfood chain. It only took a few lines before I felt like I was being targeted by a used car salesman or Carlton Sheets.People, please, save your money, or if you don't, and you read this book and find it enlightening, do yourself a favor and enroll at the nearest college you can find, and avail yourself of the real secret - Education.Find yourself a course in Critical Thinking.Good luck."
5,The Secret,"Product arrived to our home quickly, great book and well worth reading, book was in great shape. Thank you."
2,Derivative,"The Secret was a concept borrowed from the Esther and Jerry Hicks books, and I recommend them rather than this one. Also, the Seth books by Jane Roberts are very good in dealing with the human mind and reality. This particular book is watered down and simplified, put in a pretty package, and obviously it has sold millions. I was not impressed."
3,"Nice Packaging and Design...A Few Good, but NOT NEW Ideas","Reading thru this big seller, I got the impression that talking down to grown-ups, playing surreal fantasy games about success, and wish fulfillment is the way to succeed in 2007 USA publishing. The packaging here is top rate, and very attractive, but this book proves the validity of style of substance in a huge part of USA culture. Some interesting stories, coincidences, and essays about the power of positive thinking and wish fulfillment do make some lite philosophy, and self- encouragement. Like prayer, an idea hardly mentioned, it's only the good results that are mentioned. Forget the inevitable disappointments, and losses. A strong, and hardly suggested message here, is simply to stop whining and blaming everyone else for your problems.For that message alone, this small, slight, portable, and wonderfully packaged super-lite personal philosophy tome, is well worth publication, and discussion."
1,not up to hype,If you think it it will come... just a bit simplistic- Norman Vincent Peale did a much more inspiring job many many years ago. This book sucks
1,I would give is a zero if I could.,"This book is the biggest scam. Not being well written, The Secret has nothing to recomend it. Besides the poor grammer, there is much to critisize. All you learn from Byrne is that if you think something than it will happen. I am thinking this book shoulod go away but it isn't happening."
1,Same Old Stuff,"Think positive thoughts and life will be better. Where have we heard that before? Norman Vincent Peale and many others before and since. It would be nice if this book actually told the reader ""how"". Instead, it is just testimonials--not science, not new. Just the same old stuff."
5,The Secret Shared,"This is a book that should be shared with everyone you know. The web site, thesecret.tv, is a great place to preview information regarding the substance of the book. If you are considering the book but unsure DO IT! You won't regret it."
4,Inspirational,"I found Byrne's THE SECRET to be a real positive and very inspiring. I had just finished Bob Harrison's ""Saturday Night Crisis Lines"" and it was wonderful. This one stayed right up there with it."
3,If you like this--or even if you don't--get QUANTUM SUCCESS by Taylor,"This is an overview of philosophy that glances over some science. But if you want to really understand the reasons for and the solutions to true achievement and happiness, get QUANTUM SUCCESS by Sandra Anne Taylor. Taylor teaches all the why's and wherefor's and then goes on to give real, applicable techniques that can help you create an entirely different life--if that's what you want! Whatever you want, it doesn't have to be a secrete passage as this book implies. Try something really helpful and get QUANTUM SUCCESS!"
5,A Good Supplement to the Movie,"As with the other reviews here, I highly recommend watching the DVD ""The Secret"". I have found the book useful as a transcript of the movie. I've watched the movie several times and have paused/replayed some of the scenes in an attempt to write down a specific thought or quote so I could remember it. Since the book contains all of the commentary from the movie, plus a little extra and as well as some added commentary from the author, it is very useful as a transcript reference and a reminder of the ideas expressed in the movie. It's also attractively made with ""slick"" pages and a smaller size which fits nicely on my nightstand."
5,A clear path,I work in the field of self help. The book is a simple clear version of many other self help books out there. Since I have read the book my life has changed. I've used the exercise and have watch positive results unfold before my eyes. My only advice is don't give up it will happen for you too.
1,Please.....,"You'd do better to sit down and talk with an old person with some common sense and years of life experience under their belt than to read this book. In fact, someone like that could have written a better book than this. Common sense is portrayed as some kind of mystical secret in this book and to me, that is appalling."
1,Save your money,Ridiculous!!! Read this with a book club to see what all the hype was about. All of us thought it was ridiculous. It totally blames the victim in all situations. It is based on magical thinking and false science: magnetism - really!?!
1,Shallow people,"So the woman raped in Darfur brought that into her life simply by the ""law of attraction"" What is wrong with the United States that THIS is a best seller?? I cannot believe the absence of grey cells and critical thinking!"
2,Not so much a Secret......,"I bought this Book on my way back to Alabama on April 15th of this year. Quite interesting book. The ideas are not that new to me. Some are even borrowed from the Bible itself. A few from the Qur'an I might add. I am a bit skeptical about the claims which she says, for instance, ""if you keep on thinking I am going to receive a paycheck in the amil today, soon or later its going to happen"". To me thats plain stupid. And I believe some people would buy into it literally. I would recommend this book more as an idealogy. How to carry yourself in life oppose to taking it seriously word for word. All those people who cam on stating they were cured from illnesses are make belief in my opinion. I remember not to long before my trip to Alabama I saw a nighttime or primetime special on ABC, and one the coaches just made a FOOOOLLLLLLLLLLL of himself. Whether he was under pressure or not really took away from the book's credibility. But good a read"
2,Mediocre at best,"This book is extremely overrated! I mean, come on Ms. Byrne, it's no secret that the power of positive thinking can do wonders for all of us. If we wish hard enough, will we ultimately get what we desire most in life? NO! It takes more than that.....hard work, determination, persistence, faith, etc. Ms. Byrne suggests that we will get what we want out of life by simply thinking hard about it and not letting ANY negative thoughts into our head. That may be all well and good, but in my humble opinion, it isn't the answer for people who wish to make real change in their lives. This book is a waste of money and time."
1,Disappointed,"After all the hype I was sadly disappointed. I thought I was going to discover something new. To me the so called ""Secret"" is only theory. I learned absolutely nothing. I already knew how to implement positive thinking through my Christian walk and application of the life lessons of the Bible."
5,The Secret,"If you want to get your life on track this book is a must to read. Read it often, and practice daily. It will make a difference in you life."
1,"Re-write of ""Power of Positive Thinking""","It's a good thing I got this from the library, because I was very disappointed. I don't know what I expected, but it wasn't a re-write of Norman Vincent Peale's book ""Power of Positive Thinking"". If you want to read something that REALLY works, read Peale's book, not ""The Secret"". Very disappointing."
5,You get what you think about.,"This book is based on the law of attraction. Simply stated, if you want something, think about the joy's of having it, rather than the pain of lacking it. If it's money you need, and your mood is down and depressed, then you're thinking about not having money. Begin by being grateful for everything that you do have, and more will be given to you."
1,There is nothing new about this book,"I was hoping this book would totally WOW me since I have read great reviews about it. Most of the things you will find here are things you already know, things you could read anywhere (an inspirational quote in a bookmark). I'm glad I didn't spend a lot on this book. I was bored and uninspired."
1,pc,the copy of the book i ordered was poorly printed. blurred pages and some pages quite unreadable. i believe it was a manufacturing mishap. i have ordered many books from amazon and have never been disappointed. i ordered several of this same book for my sisters but theirs were fine.as far as the book content itself it is interesting but a bit superficialand requires a broader sense of self and the world to be beneficial.
3,Unable to finish the book,"This is a ""power of positive thinking"" type of book. It was very repetitive so it did not hold my interest and I couldn't finish it. However, all of my friends, and my mother, raved about it so I can't disqualify it and say that you wouldn't find helpful, it just wasn't me. One friend told me it has taken years for you to become who you are and the repetitiveness is needed to counteract all of those years of negativity."
4,The Message of the Secret,The message promoted self-creation and that is empowering. It definitely makes one look inward to search if one is using the innate creative power we all have to make the best world possible for ourselves.
4,ony one secret is revealed,"This book is repetitive but it is driving home one point and one point only. I bought this on the reccomendation of a friend, It is a single issue candidate"
1,Vibrations: Be Careful.,God help anyone who can believe this rubbish. When we belch or break wind we set up a vibration. Do we not have to be careful to set up the right vibrations in this way if we are trying to attract success? Trying to change your life by visualisation is like drawing a moustache on the mirror and expecting it to show up on your face.
1,Fast thought for your brain,"One of the most stupid books I've ever (almost) read.There is something you can't deny: good publicity campaign. An empty promise otherwise. Nothing new or secret about the secret. The whole concept is plain common sense, you are indeed responsible for your life and you should be very careful with what you wish or are afraid of because both have a tendency to become part of your reality. But the way this book, with all those false ""doctors"" and ""authorities"" (like Joe Vitale) put it is just plain Disneyland: ""Think happy thoughts and you will fly"". And the focus is extremely materialistic and narcissistic. If you want to read about the same thing in a compassionate, deeper, almost poetic style, I recomend you Creative Mind and Success by Ernest Holmes."
1,K-227,Do not buy this book! It's the stupidest book I ever read in my life! It basically denies God and tells you dumb stuff like not to worry about your bills because worrying makes you have more bills! Do not waste your money on this mumbo jumbo B.S.
1,Save your money.,"Once again the rich, white, christian sits down and tells the rest of the world what ""life"" really is. As if being rich and never having worked a day in your life doesn't have anything to do with it. All that free time and this is the culmination of it. Nevermind the fact that there's not one definition of spirituality and that its all subjective. This garbage of a book is just more of the same old tired, been-done-before, pro-paganism, anti-humanity and James Redfield apologetics!"
1,Terrible,"Want to know ""The Secret""? I'll tell you, if you think positively, then positive things will happen to you. That's pretty much it. Watching this DVD was painful. It is just a bunch of people with titles such as ""Quantum Physicist"" (as if this means they are somehow qualified to lecture us on this subject) and with a few letters behind their names telling you this over and over again in a slightly different way for 80 minutes. What a load of nonsense. There is no big ""Secret"". It's just one big marketing tool. Don't waste your time and money."
1,I was waiting and waiting...,"I was waiting and waiting...for so long, to be insulted and to be treated with much disrespect...and I kept praying that this would occur and just as the Secret had predicted, it happened...what a transforming experience it was...it made me realize that I had a secret desire to be treated that way...and so what did everything else mean? did it all go out the window? well, all I know is that the street doesn't seem to go both ways...so don't worry, your worst prayers will be answered, your best nightmares will come true!"
3,The law of attraction RE-HASHED for the masses.,"Save your money on this one - Get ""Think and Grow Rich"" by Napoleon Hill. He wrote about this so-called law of attraction back in 1937. It's a classic. The Secret? Titles are a sure fire way of selling more books. ""Hey! I'd like to know 'the Secret' is!"""
1,Really works!!!,"This was very helpful to me in my job as a cartographer! I drew up a map that wasn't very accurate, but then the Law of Attraction caused the universe to change to fit my map! Thanks, The Secret!"
1,Zero stars!,"I hoped to broaden my spiritual horizons but this is just plain hype and greed. It is beyond offensive to believe prosperity will fall in your lap because you write out a ""check"" and look at it every day! I just can't get past that.Books like this do a disservice to the reader and the many authors who make thoughtful contributions. In my opinion, it may even derail finding one's own truth. I wish the author and contributors well, but this book made me very sad :("
1,"Well, I was disappointed.","I saw this on Oprah while I was job hunting and I thought it was an interesting idea. Unfortunately, it's superficial and simplistic and has no real substance. To say I haven't won the lottery because I'm not living my life as though I already had won is both ridiculous and dangerous. My common sense prevails and I've kept my job and resisted the urge to buy a condo in Waikiki. Based on that, according to this book, I will never be filthy rich. And that's probably a pretty safe bet."
1,Pure Marketing,"One star for a clever marketing idea. IMO ""The Secret"" is a pure marketing tool. The Law of Attraction has been around forever - it is no secret. But, people will buy into a secret won't they? Very clever... but only new to people who have never heard of this law before.What will you market next The Law of Karma? Wonder what you will call it? How else can you explain babies getting terrible diseases ... did a one year old draw cancer to him or herself? How about 911 or Hiroshima or a million other horrors? Thousands of people drew all that horror to themselves. There is something working in the universe, but to simply call it ""The Secret"" just takes advantage of peoples hope."
1,Unrealistic and completely irresponsible,"I got this book as a gift so I'm glad I did not waste my own money to buy it! I've never written a review until this book came along. I am a voracious reader so I feel I need to warn people about this book.This book's message is totally absurd - so unrealistic, impractical and irresponsible - more like an approach to some vodoo magic or hocus-pocus to make life rich, free of sickness, free of disasters, etc! Get real. We need a realistic and practical guide to things, not by means of some black art or magic that this book relentlessly pursued. Are we supposed to just ""think it"" and everything will come to us? What happened to ""hard work""?I can't help but to think that the author's intention was to fool people in order to make money! And I'm sure she did. That is so obscene.Please dear readers, do yourselves a favor - don't buy this book, you will thank me for it."
1,Not my cup of tea...,I love self help books but this one didn't work for me. I didn't like the style of writing or the belief that all you have to do is think about what you want and it will happen. That is as good as the advice gets... obviously for some it works but it isn't my cup of tea.
2,no secret,A friend recommended this book-but I really found it shallow next to the works of Anthony Stultz (FREE YOUR MIND)and Ezra Bayda (BEING ZEN). I would suggest reading both of these and decide for yourself.
5,The Secret-What a eye-opening experience,I have listened to the entire set over 10 times and am still getting new insights every time I listen!
5,Great Book and Video,I think everyone needs some positive reinforcement every now and then and this book and video help to put things in perspective.
5,"If you don't know the secret, you need to",It is very informative. I helps you understand and believe. it's basically God promises and principles in a cd that calls it the law of attraction.
1,Worst Self Help Book Ever,"If you want an unsophisticated book that tells you nothing more than ""If you believe, you can!"", feel free to read this book."
2,Take with a grain of caution...,"The concept of the law of attraction is hardly knew....there is nothing secretive about the reality that what you put out generally comes back to you. However, The Secret seems to be more about great marketing then it does about sound and proven ways to improve one's life. If you want tools that can make a real difference I suggest you check outBody Mind Soul Solution: Healing Emotional Pain Through Exerciseby Bot Livingstone. He work is proven and very practical. Through his strategies, you can make real and lasting changes in a healthy way."
2,"The Power of Positive Thinking, Redux","An inspiring, self-help approach to developing a positive outlook on life. The Secret is a quick read that will leave many readers with an upbeat perspective. On the other hand, the premise is a pop-culture, feel-good approach that, long-term, will do more to enrich the authors and publisher than anything else."
3,Not especially new information but certainly interesting...,"While this information wasn't especially new, it was a great reminder. I run decluttering and time management workshops for a living for Inspired Honey (inspiredhoney.com) and so I like to have a break once in a while give my mind a tune-up (like my car). While this information is certainly not new. See the book You Can Heal Your Life written decades before or even lots of ideas from proverbs in The Bible), it is still interesting information. If it gets people analysing their thoughts more and being more in control of their choices - I'm all for it!"
3,would be effective for 'negative' personalities,"I have a mixed review on the concept of ""The Secret."" Overall, this little book will be very effective for those who persist in their daily lives with negative attitudes. However, people like myself who use an optimistic approach to life may not find this book very helpful. It can be a good reminder for everyone to approach life and situations with positive thoughts (energy)."
4,The Secret 4-CD set,"I have enjoyed listening to these CDs, the message makes sense.However, at times at times the narrator can be corny and condescending, like she's talking to a group of 5 year olds.It seems that some very pertinent information has been left out of the CD's that I got by going to 'The Secret' website and listening to the speakers on the CDs expand on the subject.All in all a good message that really makes you think."
1,The Secret,"Both my husband & I have read ""The Secret"" the book has inspired us in how we look at situations in our lives; yes, it is what we already know but we often loose sight of the positive ways to live our lives...We also purchased the DVD and enjoyed watching it, after reading the book....the DVD was the frosting ont he cake, so to speak, with listening to each person tell their story in person, being a visual person as I am it really clicked for me, both of us could identify with stories....We were so inspired with the book & DVD that we purchased 10 books and sent them to family and friends, they too enjoyed the book, we all have adopted the philosphy of ""The Secret"" and look at life in a whole other way.....we have passed One DVD on to all and once they view it they pass it on to the next couple...also other friends we spoke about the secret to have gone out to purchase the book and they too enjoyed it...We need more positive approaches in our lives and world...thank you,M.E. Cain"
3,Interesting...,"This product wasn't quite what I was expecting. While I did find portions of it motivational, the concept was the same for all areas and the CD Set could have probably been 1-2 CD's instead of 4."
3,disappointing,"This book is very well produced and is full of interesting ideas but overall I feel that it was slightly disappointing. Its message is a mixture of materialism and spirituality - and the spirituality seems compromised by the concept of wish fulfillment and satisfying limitless desires. True spirituality lies in being content within yourself, and overcoming unnecessary desires.Comment | Permalink | Was this review helpful to you? (Report this)"
2,Author Missed Key Facts,"The author of The Secret missed a key fact. Yes the Law of Attraction exists just like the Law of Gravity. BUT...... there are other forces at work in the world OTHER than the Law of Attraction (such AS the Law of Gravity for example) and many others. The author opens with the genie analogy. ""Your wish is my command"" and ""You only have to ASK and Believe.""And the author claims EVERYTHING in your life is there because you attracted it. No, No, NO!!! That's the inverse of the law of attraction and is NOT true.I'd stick with Think and Grow Rich, which can be used to obtain goals other than wealth. In that the author states right away that you have to be willing to pay the price to achieve your goal AND what you want can't violate the laws of science.I'm not quite done listening to The Secret. I have the audio version. But I'll be reselling my copy of The Secret and keeping other books on getting what you want out of life instead."
3,Instructions for the bold only,"If in the middle of the night, you can pray for angels to rain down the fire of divine inspiration and insanity--with complete understanding and acceptance of the consequences of such an act, then this collection of teachings is your cup of tea.On the other hand, if you're a bit afraid sometimes that God might take offense at some of your misdeeds, or feel compelled to yell ""bless you"" over the the foam core wall when your cubicle mate sneezes, then you'll probably find this just a bit ostentatious.I mean, you've always wanted a Ferrari and a house constructed of more glass than wood, right? Or can you admit that deep down you believe you deserve a jetta and a crappy little 3% annual raise? Better decide explicitly before continuing down this path because you'll either finally shake off the shackles of mediocrity and morality stained sense of justice, or you'll waste about $30.Like old stone tablet says: ""Caveat emptor..."""
1,Just Makes Money for Authors! Pure Garbage,"Oprah does it again! Except for she is making a millions of dollars for an author that culled her work from old and nonsensical ideas. Conveniently quotes phrases from renown scientists to back-up her worthless and no way viable ideas. Save your money and wish upon a star, because anything that can be gleaned from this book is about as plausible."
4,The Secret,"I prefer the CD, but the book is good. The subject matter is awesome and a must for everyone."
1,Imagine...,"Imagine yourself thinking positively for hours and hours and your life is changing in front of you. Put yourself in a room and keep thinking that way and see if something will occur...nothing happening yet? Alas, nothing comes out of just thoughts, it has to be applied with actions. And while consciously thinking positively is a definite plus for your emotional, mental, and physical state of mind, it will not address practical reality:(1) That you will die.(2) That you need to get food to eat.(3) You need water to drink.(4) That the universe will exist forever and you are stuck in this linear timeline.There is this ill-conceived New Age notion that man can somehow change the inner self, thereby changing his destiny. But it doesn't end up anywhere, it all ends up in vanity. A better book would be Ecclesiastes."
4,Well worth purchasing - watch it many times,"The secret is a self motivating look at how you can create your life the way you have dreamed of. Jump start on making your life and your business succeed, with changes in attitude for the better. It does work -honest. I recommend this to anyone - it absolutely life changing. It is a positive rush - that has you testing and creating the endless possibilites you've always wanted."
4,Possibility thinking,Positive thinking can change anything! I'm waiting for my book on tape to arrive!
3,The secret,Althought the premise is good. The book is extremely repetitive. They have gotten the point across more concisely.
1,The only secret is don't waste your time with this one,"An eye-catching cover, prominent position in bookstores across the nation, and an enticing jacket blurb; this book has it all except a reason to read it. The Secret's secret is pretty much common sense even if you do buy into the fluffy, hocus-pocus that it tries to blurt out. The chapters are written redundantly so you get the simple point they're trying to make over and over again, and then there are chapter summaries too! Honestly, I would just read the chapter summaries in the book store and move on with your life. This book is not worth the read, it is not an exciting novel, and it can be summarized with ""think happy thoughts.""Please pass on this book and allow us to put this in our past."
1,There's a sucker born everday!,PT Barnum would be proud. Now all I am supposed to do is think good thoughts and concentrate on getting rich and it will happen if I really believe. Yeah right. I'd be happy for my $20 bucks back (I didn't really buy it I skimmed it in the library). If you are gullible enough to buy this book well then you deserve what you get. Did the last self help book you bought help you? Or the one before that? If they did why are you even thinking about this trash? If they didn't why are you even thinking about this trash? Oh and the secret to getting wealth is hard work. Don't be a dope.RMW
2,Slow read,"It has taken me a long time to finish this small book. It is a really slow read. I don't really buy into the whole universe and new age stuff, but I do agree with the overall message about being positive. If you are looking for some earth shattering secret save your money."
3,"some great concepts, but lacks some practicality","I changed after reading this book. I thought of the world differently. The concepts really opened my eyes to new possibilities, and excited that part of me that really wants to believe I have some control over situations. Some concepts presented resonated well within me (i.e. what you focus on really does become reality), but other points of the book focused too much on gaining material possession. I think this book has the possiblity to disappoint many because I don't believe if you close your eyes and imagine a new ferrari, that one will appear. I also have a hard time wrapping my brain around closing my eyes, seeing a parking space, and it appearing. I do, however, believe that with the right focus and determination we can make our dreams a reality. I just felt this book simplified the process too much in a way that is unrealistic."
5,"Love it, love it, love it!","I love this CD. It was a first for me to purchase or listen to an audio book. Can't believe I waited so long to try it. I have been able to listen to The Secret over and over while driving to work errand, whatever. I can continuously reinforce the lessons both consciencly and unconsciencly. An added perk - my 14 year old daughter, who I never would have been able to get to sit down and watch the dvd, has without her realizing it, has begun to incorporate The Secret into her life. She even catches and corrects me if I so much as remotely mention anything that I ""don't"" want and she reminds me to speak of the things I ""do"" want instead. She is SO wise and smart! I am truly blessed and now I can't wait to go out and find more audio books. I already have several in my Amazon cart now. Don't ponder on it - just get it. You won't be sorry!"
1,Light reading,"This is light reading for the masses! If it even came 1 percent close to explaining the subject in detail then it may have been worth reading, as it is it panders to 100 percent of readers desires and spoonfeeds them hope. I didn't fall for it and will continue to read my collection of real self-help books."
1,This was really useful to me,I thought positive... and now my poop is positive. This book equals a positive poop.
1,Don't buy a book based on reviews,"Out of all the books that I've read, this is the worst one ever. Ever.It still hold its position as my number one worst book ever written after three years."
5,Life changing,"I had heard from some of my friends about The Secret, so I wanted to check it out for myself. I got the CDs right before a road trip and listened to them all the way home. It was truely life changing how positive and hopeful I felt as I started putting into practice some of the ideas from this book."
1,Not happy! Awful!,My order of The Secret C_ set still has not been received nor have I heard from the seller who I have trid to correspond with twice!
4,Many contributors,"I valued all the contributors who wrote content for this book. I found the subject matter to be useful, relevant and timely to my life. I used to think ""positive thinking"" was a superficial thing, but this book makes a compelling case for how deep and far-reaching it really is."
5,Bliss in a book!!!,"I read this book everyday.I gave this book as gifts to friends and my children. It reminds us all of the pure fact that we have the right to Be who ever we want. So much saddness is constantly feed to us that we either forget of never new ( now thats sad) how to be happy. My life has been an adventure of pain and saddness. NO MORE. When I look back now at all the bad stuff, even it that I still find happiness. If you relax and think for a minute you'll feel what I am talking about. I have now read THE POWER and other text and trust me its all getting better. All You have to do is remember that its all yours, THEY can only take from you what you do not value. Love everything and it will stay and grow and breed. Like a fungus!!!!LOLThe Secret"
2,I think the real secret is melodrama,"Very repetitive. You can't take this book totally seriously, but there are certainly important principles and ideas that you can take from it. Just don't take this book literally or you'll end up eating boot stew under a bridge."
1,A load of rubbish...,"Wish hard for what you want, and if you ""deserve"" it, you'll get it. If you don't get it, you didn't wish hard enough. There. That's the whole message of this book. Save your money for something... ANYTHING... else."
1,Painful!,"After reading (drudging) through the first 20 pages I simply couldn't take it any more. In theory the idea of the law of attraction is a good one, logically known to most and a good reminder of being self-aware and simple common sense.The way the information is presented is painful to read. The commentary notes as each person speaks is painfully repetitive and takes on a choppy cult-like cadence.For those readers/reviewers that had an epiphany and may have experienced a life changing event from the words in this book... I'm sincerely glad. The message this book presents is positive one and, for this only, The Secret deserves an atta-boy.Kudos to all the media frenzy and hype their marketing people generated for this book! Business well done.Save your money, and do not buy this book... if you're overcome by curiosity, as I was, borrow it from a friend or your local library."
1,Avoid this,"I think she's already made enough money! Seriously, the emphasis on material goods without any corroborating emphasis on the effort it takes to succeed is simply disgusting.We all have heard about the power of positive thinking. Why do we need something so 'mysterious' as the 'secret' to tell us about it. The law of attraction - please. Do you think the universe really cares if you're rich?But of course these folk know that so many of us are desperate for an easy way to wealth. This isn't it. Hard work, yes, postive thinking yes. But not this."
1,ONLY GOT HALF THE ORDER,ONLY RECEIVED HALF THE ORDER. I THINK THIS SUCKS AND I WANT THE REST OF MY ORDER. SEND ME THE OTHER BOOK!
1,When you wish upon a star............pure bunk!,"Well it seems like Ms. Byrne has certainly proven one thing by writing this book - as P.T. Barnum said many years ago ""There's a sucker born every minute""! If sales of her book are any indication, Mr. Barnum's estimate was far too conservative.For most of us, by the time we reach adulthood, hopefully we've learned that carrying around lucky rabbit's feet and wishing on lucky stars in the hopes that our dreams will come true is not the way the world (or the cosmos for that matter, work - thankfully) To think that any intelligent, free-thinking individual would fall for this kind of baloney in the 21st century is to me at least, mind-boggling.Lewis Carroll said it so well when he wrote ""if you don't know which path your on, any path will do"", and I recently heard it put another way ""if you don't stand for something, you'll fall for just about anything"". No truer case could be made for such a statement than this book.RadioActive1"
4,An Incredible Secret Awaits,"Devil's Verse: Natasha Azshatan Unlocks Ancient Mysteries, Reveals Secrets, And Wrestles With Demons As She Fights To Stay AliveLife changing. I'm a true believer in the Law of Attraction."
5,Rhonda's book changed my life . . .,"The Secret had a profound affect on me. I read through it quickly, and then read more slowly, hi-lighting as I went. When I was through the second time, I watched the video as well. At the end, Bob Proctor asks us to write down our desires, and I did. I never have thought about what I desired, for now and for my future - what a great thing to do!It is as if who I am expanded, and a thirst for knowledge and experience of things physical and spiritual emerged from me. I am grateful for Rhonda and the other teachers who shared some of what they know, and now the essence of who I am includes their thoughts and experiences too. If you want to possibly view life from a positive perspective, read this book!"
2,the secret comment,"its alright CD , something to listen to while driving. its self explanatory. in short , every person should be positive in thinking and be a good person, ."
1,Not Working???,"I have been trying to think positive! So many people have told me that because I don't think positive enough, I will never have anything good come to me. So for months I have been thinking that people would go to my paypal @ thea.bryan@gmail.com and donate tons of money to help me get through school. So far not one person has done so. I just can't believe that this positive thinking thing really works:( Maybe I am not doing it right? *sigh*"
4,Pretty Good Book,"The book is pretty good, telling you to keep positive and so on. Got a little boring after a while. It is nice to read but I wasn't overly thrilled with it. I will also be checking out some others."
5,Enjoyable read,"My baby sister urged me to read this book-so did my niece for that matter. It is a very satisfying, very enjoyable read, and if one is willing you can certainly take some good lessons away from the book."
5,The Secret,What can I say? Content isn't an issue. It is a book that I wanted to buy and it is nearly half price of one in Borders. I always check Amazon before I go to a retail book store.
4,The Secret,"Very inspiring book, only if she's going to refer to historical figures who've used the secret, she should back that up with more evidence or go into more detail. All in all, if the book is read with an open-mind I think it can help people change their perspective and move more towards positive living."
5,The Secret by Rhonda Byrne,Love this book for reminding me of truths that I know but have not acted on consistently. Moment by moment I am moving from one joy to the next. I recommend this read to all ages.
1,How Gullible Can People Get!,"I am so tired of chiropractors claiming to be experts in curing cancer and heart disease, and now in this book being experts in psychiatry. When is some govt. agency going to get after them and force them to clean up their act. As for all of the ""philosophers"" who contributed to the Secret, I would be curious to know how many actually have degrees in philosophy, and who are either professors of philosophy or written books on philosophy. It is interesting that although the book states that the Law of Attraction was known and practiced by a lot of very famous people throughout history, it gives no references to any statements by such people supporting their knowledge and practice of such a law. It is one big lie. Unfortunately, it shows how gullible most people the majority of the people who read the book thought it great."
2,Where fore art thou shiv?,"I went to the university library to take out a copy of ""The Secret"" in hopes of finding the infamous shiv. Alas, to my dismay I fear I had gotten there too late, for the cavity was present, but the shiv was missing. I have in my head, after looking around the campus a possible list of suspects...Looking for shank marks now. I have seen three so far; thankfully all three victims are still alive......Shiv still missing."
1,no real secret,"Possibly the only real secret here is how Rhonda Byrne again managed to make a fortune out of saying nothing. No one in this video says anything of value rather they allude for 30 minutes to something special going on then, whamo,"" think it and it will happen"". Well Im thinking Id wish Rhonda and all the get rich, get thin, get powered, get funky gurus would give all their ill gotten money back to the suckers who bought their stuff."
2,can't vote lower than one,"NOT EVEN Stupid people should buy this - heck especially not them, they might believe it. This books tells you that you can wish for anything and the universe will give it to you - and the author believes that a person raped is a person that wanted to be raped. The Jewish people killed by Nazi Germany and vicitms of Genocide wanted to be killed.I have wished this book away for 6 months and it still has not gone away. See, the concept is just dense."
2,No Secret,Wouldn't recommend this one. Once you've read a few chapters there's no need to read any further. The book lacks substance and is disjointed.
1,Not The Original,"The original is Florence Shinn who wrote the incredible book entitled, ""The Game of Life."" Read that for the original source of this so-called secret."
