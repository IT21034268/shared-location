4,Good Value Blade,"Yes, you can spend more, but for a few bucks, these work fine. You're going to change wiper blades every few months anyway. I don't care if you spend $20 per balde on the promise it will last longer; the truth is, you're going to change it sooner than you think. So, for $5 or so, these do just as good a job, and I can chagne them more often for less overall cost. They are quiter (no chattering across the windhsield) than the higher priced Michelin I had before. Until I find something better, I will keep buying these. Good value for the money."
2,Poor fit,"Didn't fit well on my Accord -- wiper frame was too wide, which caused it to bump up against the wiper arm and not press down fully. Inexpensive, but not a good deal if it doesn't work right."
1,shipping disaster,"It is very difficult to package these wipers, they are too sensitive to withstand any problems, they were broken in several places by the shippers squeezing the box."
4,consumer digest best buy,"Bought these because of consumber digest best buy recommendation. Cheap enough & they fit my & my wifes vehicle so I bought a box of them. Work fine, I personally can't tell if they're better or worse than anything else."
4,Excellent value,Anco 31 series were among the longest lasting blades as tested by Consumer Reports. Much less expensive than other blades but not refillable.
1,Streaks after 2 months of use,Already have issues with these wipers after 2 months of use. I only purchased these since there was a rebate at the time - will NOT purchase these again. They are loud since first use. And now there are streaks - doesnt wipe away all water from windshield. I use rainx frenquently.
2,"not new in box, wiper blade bent","I will never buy this product from amazon again. The blades I received had already been opened (and amazon indicated they were new in the box) and the 22"" blade is bent, meaning it does not wipe the whole surface area as intended. I already had thrown out the box or would have returned the item."
3,satisfactory,Fit to match same size/brand that I bought at wally mart and this was included with free freight so overall good buy
1,Bag came with a hole,"The bag came with a hole in it (punched through all four layers of the bag after it was folded), even though it was in the original packaging. The seller isn't Amazon, so further, they make you go to the post office and mail it back yourself."
3,A unique and important book,"This book offers secondary social studies teachers useful, classroom tested, techniques for teaching the social sciences and humanities. A critical perspective is cast on key ideas that relate to engaged citizenship in our representative democracy."
3,"Good, but not a 5-star novel","There's no doubt that Baxter is a talented writer, but his style and this story didn't hold my interest throughout. Some parts of the novel were funny, but they weren't rip-roaring funny like some reviewers suggested. If someone bumping their head on a car door makes you laugh, you'll enjoy Baxter's humor.Another complaint I have about the writing style is that Baxter continually interrupts the reader with his own remarks. Most of the time he does this to point out something that was either implied in the writing or common sense. The constant interruptions took away from the flow of the story. When uninterrupted, the story was a good one. Lick and Cody were very likeable characters. This was a great novel about the lifestyle they led and the friendship they shared."
5,The adventures of Lick and Cody. . .,"The first time I read this book was an experience I'll never forget. Mr. Black put a new spin on the life of a rodeo cowboy, and quite a funny one at that. The book takes place back in the days when the PRCA National Finals Rodeo was still in Oklahoma City, and the rodeo was about more than the glitz and glamour of the present-day finals in Las Vegas. If you want to find out more, read the book."
3,This Item was good for me,"I like to take a photo with near-focused pic.So, it is very useful tool.If you want, I suggest it.But I have a trouble, it has little problem with flash light!"
1,"The only ""Screamers"" here is the audience","Bottom of the barrel gore movie that wastes your time with poor effects,lighting and acting. Scream at the people who made this mess instead"
2,Boring Slow Horror movie,"This movie starts out great. There is some great gore scenes in the begining of this movie. A mans head gets ripped off another man gets his adams apple ripped out, and so on. After this the movie gets slow and boring. The great special effects are used at the begining of the movie. In the middle they are horriable. The movie is slow and boring. I only gave two stars was for the begining."
4,"Great Tape, make sure you are buying from right seller","i found a 4pk on here it ended up being around $8 for 4 dispensers, when i got the item, there was one dispenser, i emailed the company i got it from and they said amazon labeled it wrong and they only sell them 1at a time for the price i paid, the offered me to keep it or get a refund, once i said refund, they said we'll give you a refund and you can keep the tape, guess they didnt want to pay shipping backAll and all i love this tape!"
1,Tape with Dispenser,"Hi, i didn't like it and returned it back but money never arrived to my account."
5,Love The Mystery,"I have read several books by Barbara Workinger, and love her mysteries. The Amish Country is such an interesting area, and she has them down to a ""T"". I am so happy she has kept on writing since she has moved and am looking forward to more of her books,"
2,Common Sense Stuff,"In my opinion the things in this book were pretty much common sense. Things a normal bride on a budget would think of if she walked into a craft store such as Michaels. I personally did not find this at all helpful and to be honest threw it in the trash after reading it. My personal thought - Do not waste the money. ""The Knot"" wedding book is much better."
4,good advice,"This book has some great ideas and tips for having a budget-conscious wedding. I like that the author gives the 'bargain', 'budget', and 'bling' ideas for each category depending on how much you want to spend. It has good advice about talking to vendors and even alternatives to the traditional things. Using the suggestions in this book, you can have a fabulous wedding with exactly what you want for $5000 instead of $30,000. Excellent!"
5,More Than Just Wedding Advice,"I saw an ad for this book in Relevant magazine, and since I've bought bridal magazines (that show expensive ways to tie the knot) I thought I'd try an inexpensive (and Christian) option. Mrs. Davis offers a plethora of creative ideas (and actually jump started my imagination) from ""budget"" to ""bling,"" but there is more than wedding info. She also gives tips on how to live economically and intelligently in other areas of your life. This book is definitly an investment for me since I'm perpetually a bridesmaid and can offer Cara's book as advice my engaged friends (I'm not personally engaged yet, but soon). I plan on giving it as an engagement present to everyone. Thanks for a cheap (and creative) alternative."
3,Good ideas -- for a church wedding,"I'm really glad this book exists -- it does have some smart suggestions for how to avoid the vortex of spending encountered any time one comes remotely near the wedding industry. Davis does a good job cutting through some of the haze that bridal magazines create around what you ""have to do"" to have a happy wedding day. That said, pay attention to the subtitle: a church wedding. The author's game plan is all centered around having your wedding at a church, using the church's fellowship hall for your reception, and enlisting the assistance of fellow parishoners to pull the event off. If you're a less traditional couple, trying to plan a wedding outside a church, and don't belong to some kind of club with comparable facilities, there are no other suggestions for alternative venues. If you're looking for some planning tools, there is stuff included here, but most it is pretty common sense."
5,Author's notes,"It's the author speaking (I only put the 5 stars because you had to put something!) and really I'd just like to thank the readers who posted such glowing reviews for their kind words. Salem Street was my first book published as Anna Jacobs, back in 1994 and it's still in print. I've just had my 21st novel published (12 as Anna Jacobs). ...."
5,Fantastic capabilities,"This lens is a macro, a short telephoto, a portrait lens, and a landscape lens that offers new creative possibilities. Because depth of field can be manipulated as in a view camera, this is proving to be my most versatile lens in my bag, in spite of the fact it is ""just"" a 90mm prime lens. For macro shooting, even with an extension tube, additional depth of field possibilities open up with the tilt. The lens is a fantastic straight-on prime lens for portraits. I find entirely new possibilities for landscape shooting. And hand-held shots are no problem at all, even with maximum tilt. Though it is strictly a manual focus lens (the AF does not work on this one) the image in the view finder is so bright I have no problem manually focusing. Because of the extreme depth of field capabilities, my wide angle lens gets used less now that I have this lens to play with. I love it!"
5,Wish it had zoom.,"Ease of focusing depends on the camera and one's visual acuity;not so easy for me and a Canon 20D with standard focusing screen.However, images obtained with correct focus can be highly rewarding.Extender, extension tubes and ring flash are worthwhile accessories.If Canon made a zoom with tilt+shift, it could be my primary lens."
3,Pros v Cons,Pros:- It's big!- It's cheap!- It does light up.- It does provoke a conversation with guests.Cons:- Not really a toy. No moving parts. Its more of a collectible.- Detail is a tad low.- Doesn't really look like Johnny Depp/Jack Sparrow
5,cables,i had to send the cam system back that i bought these for but decided to keep them for the future
5,Perfect match for my camera...,"I bought a camera and wasn't sure what cables to buy. Fortunatly, when I put it in my cart, I was offered the option to buy cables. I was reluctant, but well pleased with the price and quality of this product. It comes with all the hardware needed to hook the camera up. All in all I would recomend this product to anyone wanting an incredible deal."
3,Hit or Miss,Bought several of these - within 90 days one of five failed. Bad connector at the DVR. Opportunity of returning or exchanging item very short. Maybe these are simply throw-away cables.
4,Good Cable For The Price.,"I bought this cable for a cctv camera system i am putting together,and it does the job.for a small 4 camera system,this will work ok.shipping was fast and the price was very reasonable.i would recommend this cable."
3,Not so goof,I was expecting a more heavy duty wire. I would rather get heavier grade from Fry's (white color). The image quality would be affected over the long distance.
5,Great purchase,"Worked perfect for what I needed. The security cameras I had purchased came with 60' cables which weren't enough. The best thing about this cable was that the electric ends were black instead of red which made things a lot easier on the other end. I'm planning on adding cameras and will definitely buy more of these. Shipping was fast as well. Be careful when opening though, 100' tangles easy...."
4,Good Value,"There is nothing particularly fancy about this cable, but it works as expected and was a reasonable price. I opted for the longer one so I'd have more flexibility in camera location. I was concerned I might get interference, but the picture is as good as when the camera is plugged directly into the DVR."
5,Perfect for the job!,"Have used this product for childcare video security system in a rather large steel framed brick structure. Running through walls, through ceilings with steel supports, around heating ducts, etc. Have not had any issues with the cable and the signal transmitted is everything it should be.Have spliced long runs together with additional fittings and am completely satisfied with the results."
1,Does not include items listed,"The description says that the cable comes with BNC RCA adapter but does not. Everything else was fine, but this cable is now useless to me without the adapter. Radioshack, here I come."
5,"Said what it did, did what it said, PLUS arrived early. Can't get any better than that. Will buy again.","Title says it all, great company, super service, on or before time. Damm space fillers so their happy. this 18, this 20, this is 21. Just print the post."
1,the connectors are very cheap you have to ajust them,"I am very pissed at this product, i made a hole in the wall the pass the cable to the outside, and plaster the hole shut, and installed the camera.. and to the DVR and it didn't work. The Power installed the power supply directly to the camera and it did work. Then got a stronger amp power supply and use the cable. It didn't work. decided to install the power supply directly to the camera again and NO VIDEO signal.. after moving the connector .. the video signal came thru.. so i had to duck tape some sticks to hold the connector still. Remember that i couldn't pull out the cable because I already closed the hole on the wall and my wife was pissed at me for making a hole in our house.In conclusion is a very cheap cable. find another."
4,cctv cables,These cables seem a little skinny but went through walls and survived. They work perfect and I feel will continue to do so. If you don't know how to treat a softer wire then don't buy. Also the softer insulation will remain more flexible in colder weather and less suceptable to cracking. For the price you can't go wrong.
5,"They were very well wrapped, and I didn't have trouble with them.","Easy to lay out, and worked very well.Easy install, only draw back is that if you use staples to secure them, it's easy to pinch the cords and ruin them."
1,WARNING DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT....,WARNING DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!! this wire is so bad and delicate will break as soon as you take it out of the package this is the first review i ever wrote in my life i just had to write this-- the product is so bad the company should b sued for making it. we wasted 2 days installing 100 ft wires 9 cameras . and now we have to take them out and get new one they dont work !!!!!
2,Flimsy,"I like to keep a few spare cables on hand for testing and, if the need arises, replacing a cable that stops working. I usually buy the Zmodo cables, but this one seemed like a really good price. I was surprised when it arrived and saw that both video and power were in the same, very thin, cable. I can see this stretching or eventually failing when used in anything other than a simple interior run.The Zmodo cables look more like very heavy extension cords, with the two cables run side by side. I'll keep this as a spare because it's not worth the hassle of returning. I just ordered a Zmodo 130' for about $20."
4,Product was what I exected,This 100 foot long extension cable was exactly what I needed to reach my last camera and was easy to install.
3,Condition of item.,The tape door is broken and there seems to be nothing I can do!Would have appreciated some way to be reimbursed. Too difficult to return now.
2,NO SALE!,"SELLER CANCELLED ORDER THE FOLLOWING DAY FOR NO APPARENT REASON, THEREFORE TYING UP MONEY ON MY CREDIT FOR A FEW DAYS. ADVERTISEMENT SHOULD HAVE BEEN PULLED IF PRODUCT IS NOT AVAILABLE."
3,Loud and Clear,"This CD player is great. Though this is a good buy, with its 3D Image Equalizer and clear, booming sound, and it will be heard down the block."
3,"Only fits 1/4"" material","I bought this mouse platform for work where I have a pre-existing keyboard drawer, but no place for the mouse. The drawer (being government supplied) cannot be replaced and is 3/4"" thick. This mouse platform will not fit on 3/4"" material - it will only fit 1/4"" material.Nothing against the product itself, but it would have been nice to know its limitations before I ordered it."
5,Excellent !,"R L Kashyap is doing a great service writing the books on Vedas. he has written hundreds of books on all Vedas - yajur, Rig, Sama, Atharva. He is a PhD from Harvard and professor at Purdue. He left it and now in Bangalore writing excellent books and preserving it. His service is really to be appreciated. This book goes into a small portion of rig Veda, but still a big book. Gives the slokas and their verbatim meaning and author also interprets them as needed."
4,The clothing profit/profite,Sometimes Clothing DOES make the man...and...Abboud is a terrific guy. His ties are wonderful. His attitudes about growing up in the fashion biz are insightful and his gift of gab is as good as his gift for garb.The fact that he likes baseball and bails of multi-colored wool is a bonus.
5,Harry has done it AGAIN!.........,"Harry is like old wine--he gets better with age!! This CD is wonderful! It blends his New Orleans heritage with crisp big band sounds. It's great. Best tracks to listen to: #12, #6, and #3."
4,The Harry we know and love!,"Let me start by saying that I have been a Harry Connick, Jr. fan ever since ""When Harry Met Sally"" and I absolutely loved ""She"" and ""Star Turtle"". They were very funky and fun, and I got to see both tours. Amazing shows, both of them. He always has the best musicians playing with him and keeps out of the spotlight long enough to let them shine! What a guy.""Come by Me"" is definitely not like his funky albums. It's a complete return to his big band sound, which I also loved. And this one is wonderful to listen to. He sounds terrific, and once again has surrounded himself with some very talented people. I must say, however, that I'm sorry to see the Funky Harry take a backseat...I loved that sound!"
5,one of the best,"Harry Connick, Jr is by far one of the most original persons I have ever heard. This cd is great. Not as fast as his earlier releases, but that's no problem. Come By Me, Danny Boy, Cry Me a River and Time After Time are some of the best tracks on the cd. please buy it! come BUY me! (sorry, that was bad)"
1,I thought this CD really stunk!,This really shows Harry Connick Jr.'s famous style of being a horrible musician.
4,Beautifully eclectic,"My favourite hkj had always been Star Turtle (and it's funky sound) until now. 'Come By Me' (the album, not the song) was a snap decision, and one that I don't regret. It's eclectic mix - Come By Me is raptorously funky, Danny Boy is perhaps the most moving rendition of this staple I've heard - took me several listenings to fully appreciate. But that's always the way it is with fine music: a settling into the rhythms and melodies. This is a great album. Buy it!"
5,WOW!,"This album IS the most amazing by the young artist. Come By Me shows a variety of different sounds, ranging from love songs to get up and dance tunes. This album will make you tap your foot and give you the urge to shake your groove. Cry Me A River the 12th song on the CD is the best song to make you cry, but numbers 1, 2, 6, 7 and 13 make you want more. THIS MAKES YET ANOTHER GREAT ALBUM BY ONE OF THE GREATEST MUSICANS OF ALL TIME. If he comes around your town-you should be in the front row!"
2,Swing This NOT !!!,Yes I agree that Harry is LOST. He cudda been the next Sinatra but he continues to mis-step. I thought he had returned to his big bank roots but this CD is a travesty. Where is the big band--call the cops!
1,Worst collection of songs and engineering,"I'm a fan of HC, but this CD is a big disappointment. First I did not like his collection of songs.Other musician friend had the same impression. I could not give the CD away.The engineering, extremely poor the orchestra seemed to be in another room and recorded with two mics stock to the wall in the opposite room.I could go on but why?"
4,Oh my gosh!,"I was so excited to hear that Harry was releasing a new big band/swing cd and that Danny Boy was on it (he did a great job on the tune in Memphis Belle). I wanted the same song, but it was not the swing version that I had heard and liked. I was a little dissapointed when I received the cd in the mail. I was expecting a big band/swing cd, but it is only a big band cd, there is nothing swing about it. Don't get me wrong, I love Harry's music I have all his cd's and I have seen him 9 times in concert, but this cd is not what I was led to believe it was, a swing cd. Danny Boy was extremely good but too slow. Everything else was wonderful. Next to Are we in love, this is my favorite cd by Harry."
2,Hmmmmmm,"I think they spelled the title of this CD incorrectly. It should of been called ""Come Buy Me"", instead. His recent albums have been completely unworthy of what hooked us all to him in the first place. I am a jaded fan and unfortunately, Harry's ""Hope Floats"" far away from me getting hooked onto him again. There are people who love the music out there, and the music on this CD was an ""Well, if all else fails"" attempt. Well, all else failed, and so was getting me back as a fan. This album was arranged in a way that was supposed to hook the fans again. I'm not a fish. But apparently some people think we are as dumb as one."
4,He's Back at What He Does Best!,"Big band is what Harry does best, and I'm so glad he's back at it. This is a great CD. I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 because I was a little bit disappointed with his version of ""Cry Me a River"". He tried a new approach, but I would have liked it better to hear his sultry crooning to a smooth orchestration rather than the heavy bass drum and drunken sounding brass. Superb as ever on ""Danny Boy"" though, and overall a great CD. WE WANT TO SEE MORE BIG BAND NEXT TIME HARRY!"
5,Whoohooo! This is GREAT,"While I appreciate and enjoyed Harry's venture into other styles, I shamelessly admit that I missed his Big Band stylings. This CD is great. I hate it when fans expect their favorite artists to keep producing the same music over and over; it's so shallow and unfair, BUT...Harry makes GREAT GREAT AWESOME big band music. KUDOS AND BRAVO to Harry!!!!!"
5,Superb .... The arrangements are terrific!!,"From the happy, up lifting ""Come By Me"" to the doleful ""Danny Boy"" this album shows Harry Connick Jr's incredible genious and range as singer, songwriter, composer, and arranger. He does a great job with some classic tunes by imparting his unique arrangements. I especially like the New Orleans jazz funeral parade arrangement for ""Cry Me a River"". His new music like ""Come By Me"" and ""Nowhere with Love"" is great. The big band sound is back, and it's guru is Harry Connick, Jr. You will not be disappointed......"
4,Pretty Good,"This was the first Harry Connick Jr. CD Ive boughten, I like it. Its a contempary mix of Big Band music. I like the mix of slow tempo vs. fast songs. Some of my favorites are Cry me a River, and Change Partners"
3,Not the best album in the world,"I love to here Harry sing, and so when I Bought his new CD, I was expecting it to sound like his ""Red Light Blue Light"" album but I was disapponted. There are a few songs that I like in particuler ""There's no business like show business"" which is a down beat version of the original. It sounds like it just came out of a film. I do not like ""Next Door Blues"" because it has some horrible old organ sounds going off all over the place. Harry's efforts should be put to making a second Christmas album or making a duet song with Diana Krall- yes folks, if this works out it is because I originaly had the idea and I gave out my idea out to all people concerned with Harry."
5,A terrific album,"Jazz pianist and vocalist, Harry Connick Jr, has made a terrific album. Back to using a big band, and mixing his newly composed songs with the standards, this is a treat. And certainly, the big band sound is not at all over-powering. Harry does some terrific piano solos. Just listen to him on the title track. Just brilliant. Plus there are a lot of magical solos throughout performed by different members of the band. And the beautiful ""Danny Boy"", not at all a jazz song, is given a fresh treatment thanks to some lovely orchestrations. This is an album sure to appeal to most music lovers, whether they love jazz or not. The booklet contains all the lyrics plus photos of Harry."
4,Harry does it his way...and that's fine by me.,"This is the first Harry Connick CD I've purchased, though I've been an admirer of his work since When Harry Met Sally. I would definately say that I got the most for my money. This album is a wonderful mix of standards and original works, combined with Harry's smooth, mellow voice and nimble fingers at the piano. I'm a huge fan of his more upbeat numbers. My personal favorites are Nowhere with Love (which wasn't exactly upbeat, but it did have a jazzy attitude that really appeals to me) and Come By Me. Some of his slower tunes seemed almost TOO slow at times. Perhaps a change in the order of tracks would have remedied this. I was especially disappointed with ""There's No Business Like Show Business."" I like this piece upbeat, fast. However, all of this failed to detract from my overall enjoyment of the album. The point is, I love it. I will absolutely be picking up some more of his work."
5,one of his best!,"Come By Me is Harrys best album yet! This album really shows ALL of Harrys talents off, from Composer to conductor to arranger to pianist to singer! He is a master in all he does and is one of the most talented musicians around today!"
3,Better then other recent CD's by velvet voiced crooner...,"Most of his CD's I've found a bit disapointing, considering he has a voice so irresistable. We've recently lost Sinatra and Torme, after Bennett's gone all we'll have left to hold the tradition of crooner are Connick(I don't count talentless hacks like Michael Feinstein or John Parezzeli). It would be so nice if he would just do one CD with a swingin' jazz trio or quartet and sing jazz standards, no originals, no wierd dead slow arrangements just straigt ahaed jazz. Oh well maybe someday. Until this we have the okay Harry Met Sally and this CD of half standards and half origianl sometimes played at sleepy tempos. Though I'll give him credit for trying to be innovative."
3,"Glad to see the return of the ""big band"", but.....","I was excited when I saw (and heard) Harry on Rosey and Late Night ~ performing ""Come By Me"". The energy in this song is FABULOUS!! Unfortunately, the rest of the album does not have the same energy or intensity.The album is a welcome return to the ""big band"" sound, but is not up to the same standards as his earlier albums, such as ""We are in love"". Keep trying, Harry! ;-)"
4,"It's good, BUT...","In general, I agree with the previous listener reviews. Let me preface by saying that I love both Harry's previous ""big band"" CDs AND ""She"" and ""Star Turtle""... the styles are definately different from each other, but Harry's GREAT at both!Now, as for ""Come by Me"": be forwarned that it is NOT an ""all-out"" swing/big band CD. There's plenty of swinging music on it, but it also contains some honest-to-God JAZZ (including some hard bop and almost atonal orchestral music). So if you like swing but don't appreciate traditional jazz (like my wife) you may not be too thrilled with his album.That being said, Harry's voice has never sounded better, and the songs that DO swing, swing HARD! But do yourself a favor... don't pass judgement on just one listening. Give it a couple of good spins before you make up your mind."
1,This record doesn't deserve the attention!,"So let me get this straight...he tosses his fans aside because he wants to be an actor...does horrible records, horrible concerts, then he dives back into what made him successful in the first place! Too late ya'll! He had us once,we won't fall for it again. I like that new crooner Brian Evans and Diana Krall. That is who I will buy, not this guy who just jumps back at the quick buck! This album, and I heard it, is horrifying."
2,Cheese,Kind of bland. I expected a more quality version of Jazz. I am not sure why. This guy is a demon.
2,Cheesy,"It's so sad when artists as talented as Connick take the cheesy, poppy (and yes, lucrative) route. I used to love this guy's piano playing and singing, but he has just gone and made such a cornball of himself that the only people that could like him are ones that consider what he does ""jazz."" Folks, this ain't jazz. Coltrane, Miles, Monk, Mingus---that's jazz!"
5,excellent resource book,a fine book for anyone looking into a shipwreck in florida or seeking information about shipwrecks ---will laid out and easy to use.
5,The Man God Uses,This book spoke volumes to me during a very difficult time. I'm thankful for a mentor that encouraged me to read/study this book.
5,Good book,"The book is being used in a small group study. It is working out great. I was happy to find the book at a great price and received it short time in almost like new condition (only a few pencil marks). We have only completed the first chapter, but the material has led toward interesting discussion. I look forward to learning and completing the material, but the book has already been well worth the price."
5,Excellent Men's Accountability Book,"If you are at all familiar with Blackaby's work, you will want to read this book.I have used the earlier workbook version of this book with two different study groups. The first group was college and military men. The second was with high school students. The book adapted well to both groups even though it is targeted to an older audience.Blackaby hits key men's topic issues in a thought provoking way. He forces the reader to encounter key issues of integrity and character and challenges you to address those issues in your own life.This book is critical reading for any man seeking to follow God's will in his life."
4,Several good ideas.,Enjoing the book now. Has a few weak spots but many strong points and thoughts about being a Chreistian man.
2,Sadly irritating,"I must have very sensitive eyes, because I am having a negative reaction to this product. I used Clinique and L'Oreal and Estee Lauder eye makeup remover without issue, but for some reason with this product, my eyes itch, water for several hours, and just generally feel swollen and uncomfortable. I thought at first that it was just because I changed product, but I've been using it for over a week now, and sadly, my eyes continue to be red and irritated. It does easily remove all of my eye makeup, so in that regard, it works well and does what it's supposed to, but it causes such irritation, I cannot continue to use the product."
3,Great if your makeup isint waterproof!,This product is fine unless u wear waterproof eyliner. I use mac and this doesnt cut through it at all! For that I need something oil based unfortunately
3,Sufficient Eye Make-Up Remover,"This eye make-up remover does the job, but is not the best that I've used. After I apply the remover it turns the outer portion of my eyes red and makes them feel a little dry. It takes many applications to remove the make-up and sometimes it doesn't get it all. Also, the remover slightly irritates my eyes. It could be just me, but I have definitely used better. I'm really picky when it comes to my eyes so I could be overly critical, but I will NOT buy this product again."
4,Not a bad movie to see on Hurricanes,"I showed this movie to my students to study the effects of Hurricanes. I believe it covered the storm that ended being made into the book and movie, The Perfect Storm which was about a northeaster that ended up becoming as powerful as a major hurricane. I found the dvd educational and entertaining and my students enjoyed it as well."
4,So far so good,"This book definitely incorporates a lot of activities that reinforce skills you would use in math, science, reading, etc. I do think that some of the activities you could definitely come up with on your own. Needless to say, a good book for those parents out there who are at a loss of what types of activities will foster their kids learning experience."
2,stale,"i used to buy these all the time, but I moved and could no longer find them at the grocery. I was excited to see them on amazon warehouse deals, but they arrived very stale. Maybe I just don't get warehouse deals and it was supposed to taste horrible? That seems wrong. Also somewhat different flavor and packaging than I remember years ago at the grocery."
5,so much eaiser,"We had used wood chips and when having our house Bunny Nate and his long hair they'd be all over the house.espically with having hard floors. Then we discovered the Kaytee wood pellets litter, We love it. Very absorbent, no nasty smells and no mess all over the house. WE recommend this stuff 100% it is great."
5,Great little BBQ,"Bought this for use outside our new little travel trailer. Space and weight are strong considerations for us.It is compact and light in comparison with many other similar products. However it is still quite functional with a number of cooking options.Clean up is not real easy, but I am not a great fan of housework at home or on the road. Next time out, I will try using foil to make clean-up easier. That is not a complaint, in fact the grill did a nice job of containing the mess of cooking steaks, as well as bacon and eggs. I just don't liking cleaning up anything. Grin!"
4,Good Read for Class,The book does a well enough job describing the ways of enhancing writing. But pay attention to get the most out of it
3,If only,"Ah... if only the deep passion of this great woman of song could have been captured with the technical expertise of modern sound recording. Alas, it was not meant to be.The sound remimds me of listening to her recordings on my grandfather's old gramophone. If you can listen past the technical quality of the sound you will hear a heart an passion that is not found among us anymore.Janet Baker has this same deep spirituality in her singing and you can get some decent recordings of her english plain song style singing on this recordingEnglish Song Anthology. Still not great sound but wow what performance!"
5,slick system,"So I'm not going to pretend to know much about home theater technology. This is my first excursion into the market. I'm really pleased. The sound is great and picture quality seems good (although my TV isn't that big).The main critcisms I've seen on this system are the lack of power (this isn't a problem) and the lack of coaxial inputs (it just has optical inputs). The lack of coaxial inputs did represent a problem as I have Time Warner Digital Cable that only has a coaxial output, not optical. However, this problem can be solved by buying a digital signal converter that will allow you to run your coaxial cable box output into your optical input on the denon system. I bought a simple one way converter from sound professionals (about 30 bucks).And if you're intersted, it looks awesome too, despite the lack of pictures on this site."
1,Do you like stripes?,"They fail to mention in the description that this film is only 6 inches wide. So to do a rear window it requires 4 or 5 strips. The instructions tell you to overlap the strips and that leaves several dark stripes across your window. It looks terrible! I ended up throwing this away and buying a kit with a 24"" wide film that worked perfectly. Do NOT buy this one."
5,Great Book,"Has alot of the older squadrons from the late 60's early 70's.Names some of the Air Force Bases that I lived at, as well as theGreat photos of some long ago Jets. Good to add to anyone's collectionB.Z."
3,A good overview of fishing in Alaska,"This book has a board view of fishing in Alaska. Unlike other books I have read on crabbing in Alaska this book tells about crabbing, salmon fishing, dragging and how the fishing in Alaska has changed over the years. It is a good overview of the fishing industry, but lacks the exciting tales told in Spike Walkers books on the Alaskan crab boom of the late seventies."
4,Solidly written book on fishing,"Ill keep this brief. The book has many sections ranging from basic trips out on the grounds, to harrowing tales of lost life and salvation. Also, to those who are very interested in the innerworkings of the industry, there are some gray areas that are cleared up in a rather dry but informative chapter.I reccomend it to fans of Spike Walker's booksE"
5,Good read,"An intimate look at what it is like to spend your life chasing fish. Matsen's experience inside the industry gives a hard look at the reality of long hours, tight quarters and the gamble of the catch. Tight prose pack a lot of information."
2,Keep looking!,"I read the other reviews and thought, ""It's tape. How bad can it be?"" Well, it's that bad. I would definitely recommend looking elsewhere. The Duck tape I had purchased at a local store had more tape per role and worked much better."
5,3M tape is much better than Staples tape.,3M tape is much better than Staples tape. Staples tape breaks diagonally which makes it very difficult to use.
3,"A good book, but i've read better","Max Silver has managed to keep his real identity a secret, but almost everyone knows who Maximum Boy is. Now the President has called on Max to help with a baffling case that has everyone reaching for toothpaste and octopus! An evil fiend has made all food taste like broccoli - and only Maximum Boy can stop him. Somehow Maximum Boy has to figure out who it is and stop them before the whole world is affected.Dan Greenburg has made an okay start with this series, but he could have done much better. This series reminds me of the Captain Underpants books, but this book is for a younger age group. This series could get boring rather quickly because they all seem kind of the same, but I have to admit that I thought it was really cool that Maximum boy is allergic to math problems and dairy products. There are cool villains and other super heroes to make the stories more interesting, but Greenburg is not as funny as he thinks he is."
2,So-so,"Ok, I've had this chair now for two years and use it infrequently. It sags pretty well and the carry bag zipper only lasted about 6 months until it no longer zipps. I wouldn't purchase this chair again, especially for what I paid originally. I figured if I paid a bit more, I'd get a better product. This lasted just like the $10 chair I can by at a local retailer."
4,battery charger review,does exactly what its suppose to do. no issues other than some difficulty at times getting the battery into the charger..
2,Zoom lens...only barely,"I recently purchased this zoom lens expecting a 2x lens, it is more like 1.2x. At the camera's max zoom i measured a picture area of 5.5"" with the normal zoom and about 4.5"" with this zoom lens, this is an improvement, but really not that astounding. Also at the low end of the camera zoom the edges of the frame are cut off by the lens. Thirdly the lens is not silver as in the picture, but is black, while this is not a big deal it would be nice to be able to see exactly what you are getting.I also purchased this with the Opteka .45x wide angle lens which did not fair much better."
3,Gift,"This was a gift for someone who had a small grove of various bananas in Florida. It was suggested as necessary by a grower in another part of the state, so I suppose it contains vital information. I do not kow haw many stars to give it."
2,not a good workout to loose weight,"I just had a baby and while I worked out 8 months of the pregnancy I couldnt the last month...I thought this would be a good workout to help jump start my weight loss goals after the birth but there is no way this will tone, lift, or help you loose pounds. I do turbo jam, turbo fire, brazil butt lift, and I love jennifer kries precision toning all concentrated on the middle section! If your goal is to loose pounds or get tone this wont do it. this will only help you stay there if you are already very well there! very dissapointed :("
1,Quite a let down,"This stereo makes a strange chipping sound on certain cd's of mine that play just fine in my car cd player and my portable cd player. It also overheats real fast. But it does have exceptable sound and bass as long as you don't like turning your music up, and who doesn't."
3,Thera-Band X-Soft Stability,"Used to improve balance, postural stability, proprioception, and coordinationUnsteady surface challenges the body to maintain postural stability and balanceSofter the pad, the more vestibular challenge is providedAvailable in: Soft, firm and x-sof"
1,Don't Waste Your Money!,"I was extremely disappointed in this book -- I didn't even finish it. It seems the only dialog the main characters were capable of was, ""No-no-don't-I couldn't stand it."" There was no imagination in the writing of this book. The same things happened to each of the characters, i.e. what happened to the man in one chapter happened to the woman in the next. No character development to make you care about any of the characters and the plot was sorely lacking. What a disappointment for a Blue Moon book."
1,Disappointment.,"This book delivers none of the promises you may expect from its title. I simply do not understand why the author has to spend such an enormous energy to point out the superiority of the isosceles stance over the ""Weaver"". Do you truly care? Have you bought the book to read a history of pistol technique (from the late 20th Century to Postmodern) or IPSC/USPSA champions, or, because you would like to improve your accuracy, speed and technique? There is no suggestion how to assess or measure your current level, deficiencies or faults (Would you know, just from reading this book, if you have trouble with your trigger pull or recoil flinch?) There is no useful advice how to improve any of your problems, at the end you are not much wiser than at the beginning. (Perhaps the only usable section is around page 135-140.)"
2,Disappointing,"This book would be great if it actually gave you instructions on how to carry out most of the techniques given. The detail that is given in this book is very basic firearms handling skills. This book is more of a how to shoot for beginners then a how to better your shooting. This book did not cover anything that isn't in every other firearms handling book I have ever read, and the skills it goes over are the very same skills you would learn in a basic firearms class."
4,Slightly disappointed,"I give it four stars only because it's not a BAD book, and it's priced well.For a little more money, you can get the 5th Edition of Combat Handgunnery, which has most of the same information, plus a lot of good information on choosing a pistol, ammo, holsters, etc. Ayoob (writer of Combat Handgunnery) seems to shoot with a modern isosolese stance with his elbows locked, which I can't get to work very well. Stanford cautions against shooting like this because besides not working as well, it's bad for your joints.There are a few little things that I picked up from the book to try out, and the methods described in the books work well for me (it took me thousands of rounds to find what works), as well as many others."
4,Good place to start,For the novice shooter this gives a good place to start to gain more confidence and more reliable shooting if you are conceal carry and things go down and you need to be able to place your shots. There are excersises for shooting near the end of the book.
5,Impressive,"Impressive book by Andy Stanford. His explanations and thought process are dead-on (pun not intended). I wish the photos were in color or had multiple angle views. The valuable information he provided definitely helps me be a better marksman. All in all, an excellent book on firing, aiming, stance, and etc..Must read!"
3,Simple and good... could be better!,"Addresses well the themes in the subject, but at some point it becomes a bit boring with the whole discourse of ultimate stances (isoceles versus weaver). By the end of the Preface you've already got the message. Repeating it in every single chapter costs it at least a star."
5,Very practical shooting book,"This book does indeed push the isosceles stance quite a bit. However, the book is very practical about that subject as well as other facets of defensive shooting. I have been shooting handguns for less than 2 years, have taken two training classes on concealed carry and pistol shooting, so I am very far from being an expert. I shoot about 100 to 200 rounds every weekend, and have worked hard to improve my accuracy and speed.This book is written well and I was able to immediately apply the techniques to my grip, stance and follow-through. Though the author is outspoken about his beliefs, he does so with convincing writing, and his confidence yet humility come through. I was convinced that the Chapman (modified Weaver) stance was best for me......until I read this book and applied it. Highly recommended."
4,A very worthwhile read,"Stanford's book is solid: well-written, clear, and oriented for both right- and left-handed shooters. Much of it dwells on the natural superiority of the isosceles stance over the Weaver, but there is a great deal more here as well. It would be nice if there were a further reading list, more resources for shooters, and more material in general. Still, if you carry or if you are just interested in fast, precise shooting, this book is a great read."
2,Surgical Speed Shooting,"This is a basic nut and bolts book. If you have been doing any shooting, don't look for to much new information. This book would serve the novice shooter not much help for the mid road guy.Unless you are a novice, save your money."
1,Very disappointing,"The author spends the first third of the book ranting about how stupid people are who use the Weaver stance. He seems more concerned about making his point with Weaver fans than in actually teaching anything. He makes many statements throughout that do not inspire confidence in his advice. The first rule of life is to be careful where you get advice, and that goes doubly true if your life will depend on it. While there are some good concepts here, there is nothing that is not explained better in other books.Save your money and buy something from Gabe Suarez instead."
4,Surgical Speed Shooting,Book in great condition as promised. Delivery date was 2 week spread. Book came in middle of 2 week period.
1,Waste of money,"I am quoting another users comment below which sums up this book exactly:""At the end you are not much wiser than at the beginning""Stay away from this book, complete waste of time."
2,Decent read but there are better books and ways,"I cruised through this book when I was already a decent shooter. There wasn't much there for me that I didn't already know. It's informative for a novice or marksman level shooter. If you want a book about the principles and mechanics as well as the mental aspect I would suggest Brian Enos' Practical Shooting. I got more from that book than any other. Even better yet. Find a shooting instructor such as Stanford to learn by doing. Enos will raise your game by getting you to better interpret what you are ""seeing"" that you may not be conscious of."
3,"Does not live up to its title, but otherwise decent","This book tries to cover most aspects of defensive or tactical shooting. It is NOT about surgical accuracy. In fact, I have not found any book that is about achieving accurate shooting technique, besides the US Army Pistol Marksmanship Training Guide which you can find for free online, and which is better than this book. On the topic of defensive shooting etc, Gabe Suarez's books are probably the best bet for you.Pros:- well illustrated- concise and to the point- latest techniques and most current thinking explained; up-to-dateCons:- chapter on trigger control is shortest in the book, even though author says this is the biggest accuracy problem for most shooters- too much space (more than for grip and trigger control) devoted to basics like loading, reloading, malfunctions, drawing, holstering, etc issues unrelated to accuracy in shootingOverall, not a bad book, but I feel Gabe Suarez and Massad Ayoob are better authors on this topic."
5,Best approach to tactical shooting,"Straight, simple, easy to understand and to put in practice. This is one of the best books on high speed shooting techniques all around. Very recommended."
2,Don't buy it.,I am really dissapointed in this throw. The fabric is stiff and uncomfortable against the skin. There is very little down in it and it doesn't provide much warmth.
2,very small,"This was purchased for a living room blanket, it is so small though it's barely a lap blanket. If you are looking for something to cuddle up under to watch tv pick something else. It does make a good blanket for the car though. Its soft and the feathers stay put inside the blanket."
3,Holiday Snow Flurry Down Throw,"It was a great blanket for $5, but not one that I would have spent $25 on. It is soft, but a small throw and very thin. I bought many to give as gifts, but expected better quality."
5,down throw,"these down throws are much larger then I expected,and are so warm and pretty.well worth the money"
3,Worth the price,"For the price that i paid for these blanket, it was worth it, I bought 6 of these for gifts."
2,You get what you pay for it seems,"I had purchased one of these units for my mother who still uses VHS tapes for her afternoon Soaps and it lasted about a year. I purchased a 2nd unit just 3 months ago and it has died. I'm going to purchase one more with the hopes that it will last a bit longer. These units are getting harder to find and I'm not about to pay $160 for a unit that basically doesn't get much better reviews. The cost is good but if this one fails, I just may go find a used VCR and give that to her instead."
3,Rewinding,You used to get this product under $20. It's to expensive for what it is. Hoping it lasts. It takes longer to rewind to suit me.
5,VHS rewinder,"Works excellent and we are very pleased with it!My mom has a lot of VHS tapes, and the rewinder in the player didn't work anymore!"
1,UNUSEABLE,"I WAS ABLE TO USE THIS REWINDER FOR A SHORT WHILE, THEN IT JUST STOPPED WORKING. THIS IS THE SECOND ONE I TRIED AND THEY BOTH STOPPED WORKING A SHORT WHILE AFTER I RECEIVED THEM. I DONT KNOW OF ANY OTHERS ON THE MARKET. I AM GOING TO TRY TO GET MY MONEY BACK. MY FIRST ONE WAS FROM ANOTHER RETAILER."
4,Video Cassette Recorder,Works fine most of the time. There are some cassettes it will not rewind. Not sure if the fault is the rewinder or the cassettes.
3,not sure if i like it,"bought this for my dad's class/school was hard to find,expensive, and slow to ship add in that the picture and discription differed extreamly from the product I'm not impressed !-!"
5,A Must Have!!!!!!,"Do you have a VHS tape that you have already watched and would like to watch again? If so then you need this product, it will actually rewind that VHS tape so that you can re-watch it. An absolute life saver for those of us who have a VCR and like to watch things more than once. Seriously, run don't walk to your nearest retailer and buy this 1-way VHS rewinder."
4,KINYO UV-413 1-Way VHS Rewider,"It is not easy to find video rewinders anymore. This one is quit adequate, better than another I recently ordered."
3,Kinyo works good but not lasts long,"I bought two brand new Kinyo Super Slim UV-413 for ten dollars each. All worked OK and rewinded very fast. However, the first one could last only 3 months, and the second one followed the same fate; it stopped working today, July 28, 2007; it could only last for 3 months and 10 days!!! I don't know how to fix it. I ask some experts for help, and they just say, ""Get another new one because it's cheap. With fifty dollars, you can buy five Kinyo UV-413, and you can use them for 2 years."" Is it a good deal?In short, this product is working so good, but its life expentancy is very short."
1,not worth the cost of shipping,This rewinder was purchased on 12/17/08 and quit working three weeks later. Will not purchase another product with this name. Very disappointed.
1,poor purchase,the rewinder i bought did not work.i lost my paper work so could'nt return it.very disappointed with this purchase
4,VHS Rewinder,This is my third rewinder in several years. I couldn't find a VHS Rewinder in any stores and was able to get one from Amazon. I use it a lot and I'm very pleased with it. The price was right.
3,ok,"It does the job, but it seems to have a hard time doing so. Takes a couple of tries to go, then OK"
5,video tape rewinder,"I am very pleased, so far, with the video tape rewinder that I recently purchased from Amazon. I was afraid that they did not even make them anymore. This is exactly the same rewinder that I was replacing and I had had for about 12-15 years."
1,Kinyo Dinosaur Rewinder,"This machine was archaic looking, and functioned as bad as it looked. Maybe I just got a dud, but what an overpriced waste of money. Yeah, the VHS has been on its way out, but there are still some good VHS machines and rewinders out there. This was not one of them."
1,Worthless piece of junk.,KINYO UV-413 1-Way VHS Rewinder. This tape rewinder ran terribly slow and noisy. Took ten minutes to rewind a tape and didn't rewind it all the way. I threw it in the trash. A worthless piece of junk.
1,VHS Rewinder,This is a total piece of junk. Do not purchase this rewinder. It didn't work right out of the box.
2,KINYO UV-413 1-Way VHS Rewinder,"I bought this product and it does work.. But it is half the speed or slower than my last one. The picture is not a picture of the of the product. The product looks like it came from a larger brick of plastic and the design is out of the 70's. Other than it works, I'm disappointed with the speed and the way it looks (it clashes with everything). Go to this link it will so you what it really looks like and its the same price. [...]"
4,Rewinder,The product came in great condition. It worked perfectly. Hope it will last for a while. The packaging was in tact and I would purchase this item again. I will probably get another one just in case.
1,Works great for 3 months! otherwise save your money,"This rewinder lasted barely 3 months of minor use. Then, one day I plug it in to rewind a tape and....nothing! I'm not kidding I probably only rewound 25-30 tapes with this thing. I understand the idea of planned obsolescence. But a product should last over a few months. Especially when I pay over $25 for it. This ended up costing me almost $10 a month for its use. Or a $1 a tape!!! It's cheaper to get a VCR for $30 that will last a year and just use that to rewind tapes. In viewing the other reviews I see that there is a high percentage of other users who have had the same issue with Kinyo breaking after a short time of use. Should AMAZON really be carrying a product with this many users saying it that breaks after just a couple months?If you need a rewinder I say look for a cheaper one that might break after a few months...at least you'll be saving money!"
1,Poor product,"I had the unit about five weeks, made about ten to fifteen rewinds and it no longer works. One of my poorest selections for a piurchse in 86 years. This is now a few weeks later after I received an exchange. This new one lasted less than three rewinds and it broke down exactly as the original. The lid would not stay down unless you held it down during the rewinding process. This product isn't worth even a review let alone a puirchase."
1,Reveiw of KINYO UV-413 1-Way rewinder,"Product:Kinyo UV-413 1 Way VHS RewinderThe rewinder absolutely does rewind video tapes. However, at the end of the reel it does not shut off and open as it is supposed to do. When it is done rewinding the motor continues to run with a different noise level, but the unit doesn't open up. I have to stand around the unit to hit the open bar to the unit to shut it down. Otherwise it wouldcontinue on and destroy itself. It would be nice if you would have your vendor send me another unit since it is not economically possible to send this back."
2,rewinder,"This was suppose to be a new item. However, marks on the rewinder made me believe it was not new."
1,Manages to make a great story boring.,"Great story, poorly written. I was excited to find this story. I read a third of it and had yet to read anything about Tony's amazing abilities. I knew all about his ancestors, etc., and family stories before he ever came along, but I wanted to read about HIM.I don't think I can exaggerate how poorly this book is written. A most ordinary account of an extraordinary person.DON'T BUY THIS BOOK."
4,Amazing Story,"This is an amazing story about a highly talented man, Tony Deblois. To fully understand his talent and the reality of his achievments, buy his CD from www.cdfreedom/com or contact his mother in Boston."
3,Unique Idea,"This isn't Ruby Jean Jensen's best book, but the premise is unique. A little girl finds a pendulum that predicts the future. She takes it to her school's Halloween carnival and has the most popular booth there. At first, it's all fun and games. But soon, the pendulum predicts the same thing over and over--UNSPEAKABLE HORRORS.And this is where the story really begins. The little girl has to stop the evil that's happening.Pendulum is something I'd recommend as one of the first horrors for a teen. It might be too much for someone very young, but I read it when I was a teen and it's a good book for those just getting into horror."
5,Great belt!,"Great belt, easy swap on my 2000 ZR2 Blazer, no more cracked squeaking belt! Will be ordering a couple more for other vehicles soon."
2,The Catholic Mystery - Not Quite Revealed!,"John Armstrong starts out his book in the very beginning by saying that he doesn't think that there will ever be unity between Catholics and Protestants, no matter what efforts they can be superficially united in. He attempts to explain the Catholic Mystery using many quotes and comments, unfortunately, the reader once again ends up with a lot of misinformation about the Catholic Church!Armstrong may have tried his best, but he falls very short. If you truly want to learn about the Catholic Church you are going to have to use Catholic sources, such as the Catechism of the Catholic Church and other books, especially your Bible. Listen to some tapes by Catholic apologists and compare their arguments with Armstrong's arguments! Break open that Bible and read it all! Then you decide! The Catholic Mystery is still unfolding, yet Armstrong sheds little light on it."
2,For crying out loud...,"RE: the previous review from Ben in Texas: Catholics DO NOT adore Mary; we honor her. Adoration and worship is for God alone! And we do not sacrifice Christ at every Mass...if that is what you're thinking after reading this book, then you've wasted your time...For crying out loud, if you want to know what Catholics believe, ask a CATHOLIC!"
5,I was there....,"I was there, and he gets most of it right, according to my memory. A few, mostly minor, details were wrong, but they were things that only full time Navy personnel would pick up on. It was interesting to see things from a slightly different perspective than my own, and I found out some things that I didn't know at the time. Great book that I bought in 1986 and re-read recently. Many familiar names in there, many of whom went much further in the Navy in later years. Obviously George had to cut many relevant things out of the book in order to achieve a publish-able book that was acceptable to all, but he still retained an honest report."
5,Fascinating Book!,"This book explores the wonderful and fascinating world of old newspaper advertisements. I had a terrific time reading it, and will never look at an old newspapers the same way again. A great read!"
5,Excellent Cover Art!,Very interesting book . . . and the cover art is extremely cool!Mooo! Who did the Red Cow?- Mike Melone ;-)
5,incredible trilogy (by non sci-fi fan)!,"I just finished the 'Offworlder' recently, along with 'Blue Planet' a couple weeks ago. I loved reading 'Blue Planet' book 1 of the Gentile Trilogy, so much that I could not put it down. I don't like sci fi, so when I started offworlder it started out a bit slow for me as it was in the off world with a cadre of aliens. but it grew on me very quickly, as the characters created by John Gentile were so intriguing and lovable, i got totally captivated by them. Even before finishing book 3, Siren's Song, I am hoping to see this trilogy become the next Indiana Jones box office blockbuster hit-- I think it would be great on film. Ridley is the next Dirk Pitt in my book, and even better. It's so unrealistic, but seems not so when you read it. The characters are great, the writing keeps you turning the pages and the story is wonderful. I can't wait to finish Siren's Song! Way to go John. Keep Ridley,Mara jul,and Azernoth-zin alive. Wow-- what a read."
5,too short but real fun,I loved the story. It was engaging and fun. Most sci-fi stories get too confusing with sudo-science but Gentile keeps it character driven and moving. I will eagerly await the next installment.My only criticism is that I finished the book so fast that I wanted to read more but now have to wait.
5,John R. Gentile Does it Again,"Great story, terrific cast of aliens and, just as in Blue Planet (Book I), Offworlder also packs a wollop at the end. John is equally at home writing space battles as well as vividly drawing the reader through the landscapes of the minds of his believably drawn characters. There's love, intrigue, fine flashes of humor, betrayal and nothing less than the survival of earth hanging in the balance. This series has it all, including, as the best science fiction does, the ability to resonate, but never in a heavy-handed way, with events happening in the world today, right up to the minute.Like the rest of the reviewers I also eagerly await Book III!"
3,Honda mower blades.,"It is my belief that these blades are somewhat on the light-weight side.Not as dependable as the real thing. However, they are OK with an oldmower which is now begging to be replaced."
3,Can be a time saver,"If you need stripes of tape all the same size, this can be a time saver. For my original purpose, this did not work as well as expected, but I am keeping it to use for repairing my classroom books and it will work just fine for that."
3,Good Espionage Film,"Good plot, surprise ending, good script, love and betrayal, decent acting. A few scenes stretch credibility but for the most part an enjoyable cold war spy yarn."
2,Not as good as his other book,"I have bought almost all of the SNMP/RMON books and they are really nothing more than the RFC's a bit better formated and indexed. I had great hopes for this book, because Perkins ""Understanding SNMP Mibs"" was excellent. However, this book is no different from the dozen others that I have read. If you want a nice reference book and already have an understanding of RMON this book is nice. If your looking for insight or more explanation than the RFC's you will not find it here."
5,Beautifully Eclectic,"This album is very smooth, with plenty of substance. I love how Elizabeth introduces some occasional Arabic and French lyrics, a reminder of how cosmopolitan the Lebanese are. Add to that the Latin American influence, and you have a truely diverse album. What unifies it all is her velvety voice. My favorite tracks are the last two, which introduce the Arabic ""oud"" instrument. All in all a very enjoyable debut album."
5,Ya Oud,"can't agree more...last two tracks Ya Oud are awesome (fantastic voice and lyrics...) i guess she hasn't been to Lebanon ? also track ""Creo"" is superb"
4,"Excellent, Not Perfect","I saw other reviews about scratching, misalignment/small corking, super absorbency. As I was highly motivated by absorbency and style, we bought them and love them for those reasons. They are sandstone (which is why they absorb) - they look smooth but have a rough, sandy quality on the edges and will scratch (tested on inconspicuous area). For the most part, they will not be moved around (even with 5 young kids) so we're not worried about scratching/dropping. The corking is off center on every one displaying a lack of details, but that is not visible and again, primary use is my home office desk and absorbency is key. I'd say the choice is between scratching/protecting furniture or absorbency. Style is amazing."
2,Disappointed!,I am very disappointed. I should have purchased the plain ones. These do not absorb as the plain ones did.
3,shoe quality,Greetings! Thanks for the fast shipment of the item i purchased.i just have a concern regarding the quality of the product. i played badminton as my hobby and i used the shoes as soon as i got it. my concern is that the left side portion of the left shoe got torn after i used it for 1 week. I like the overall performance of the item and it suits my game.
4,Quiet but a little slow,"The rewind process is much quieter than with the model I formerly used, which gave out after a few years of decent service. While VCRs are gradually being replaced by DVD and hard drive recorders, it's good to use a rewinder to reduce wear and tear on your VCR's motors. This accessory takes longer than the VCRs to rewind a cassette, but that's a small problem."
1,Not worth the money,"I purchased one of these rewinders because I wanted one that was good and would last. The first one I got died in a couple of weeks under mild use. I returned it and got a second one. It seems to work well, but isn't very fast. I wonder how long this one will last. Considering that this is a very expensive rewinder I expect much better an wish that I had just gone with the cheapest one available as it would probably be better."
5,Commercial Grade Tough,"We bought one of these units for use in a busy public library - rewinding the hundreds of VHS tapes per week that are returned to us with out being rewound. Previously we were using the $7-$10 cheapo units sold in stores, and we would wear them out in a couple of months. This unit seems to be perfect for our needs. It is simple to use, quiet, fast, and seems to be holding up very well to the wear and tear we are putting on it. If you have a lot of VHS tapes to rewind, I highly recommend this commercial grade unit as a better alternative to the less expensive, less durable units out there."
3,quality control,"I ordered two of these items. One operated properly and the other one did nothing. You sent me a replacement. The replacement works, but the red indicator light does not function.Feedback: The rewind speed is really slow, especially for units that are supposed to be professional models."
3,VHS Rewinder is Good But Slow,"So far the Kinyo 1-Way VHS Rewinder has performed without any problems. It is very quiet and opens automatically when the rewind has been completed. The only fault I have with this product is that even though it's touted as ""Heavy-Duty Commercial Use"", I can't imagine a video store or a library, for example, being very happy with it's performance because it's incredibly slow. This machine takes almost twice as long to rewind a tape as does my VCR. However, for the price and the fact that I may only rewind 2-4 tapes a day, I believe it's a good value, saves wear and tear on my VCR and therefore the slow speed isn't really a big issue for me personally."
1,You don't always get what you pay for!,"I thought I'd ""splurge"" and spend the extra bucks to get a heavy duty machine. I've always bought the little $10 models, which last only 3-4 years at best. This Kinyo Commercial rewinder was broken right out of the box. Dead. Nada. What a disappointment. On the bright side, though, Amazon has the best return policy in the world. What a company!"
2,Poor Quality...,"Product worked, but it took a gorilla to get it open to insert a tape. Had to use a tool to press the button everytime to get it open. Would not recommend."
1,Very unhappy with rewinder,The rewinder falled in about one month use. Really the item should be reated zero. Truely it was not a heavy duty rewinder.It was used about twice a week and it failed.
1,Don't waste your money! Lasted 8 months of light use!,I WAS happy with the Kinyo NK-2 Heavy-Duty Commercial Use 1-Way VHS Rewinder UNTIL IT DIED AFTER LESS THAN EIGHT MONTHS OF VERY LIGHT USE!!! Don't waste your money on this piece of junk! I bought this because I was sick of paying for a new rewinder every year or so. SURPRISE!!! The so-called Heavy Duty Commercial Use NK-2 didn't even last as long as the rewinders costing 1/3 as much!
4,Theological and Homiletical Reflections,"Dr.s Saunders and Campbell bring the silent voice to the front through their experiences on the streets in Atlanta. This book is helpful in understanding more about urban issues (Atlanta's specifically), as well as reframing homiletics and personal context. Some easy chapters, some more difficult. Definitely worth the read!"
4,Scotch Super Strength Packing Tape,"I ordered this tape because I ship a lot of items and needed something that was strong, yet easy to dispense and use. This tape works well and is more economical purchased from Amazon."
5,"Strong, Sticky Tape","This tape comes as advertised, it is quite strong and provides all the stickiness you could want. I've used it with multiple packages and have been pleased with the results. One note is the volume of noise when pulling the tape off the roll. Probably not advisable to do around sleeping babies or at the library. Whether you're purchasing tape for the office or ramping up your eBay or Amazon business, this tape and dispenser will do the trick."
5,Tape for packaging,"Reinforced tape for packaging in a handy dispenser. Great for sending boxes with heavy items.I have tried cheaper stuff, but Scotch makes the best."
4,Quality product,"As far as packaging tapes go, this one is super strong and effective -- I'm currently in the midst of packing for a move, and this roll has gone a long way in sealing boxes and keeping things together. I also sell a lot of books online, and use this to seal my envelopes. I've never had any complaints about the shipping!"
1,HARD TO USE,"I found this product very hard to use. To start the tape I had to struggle with the tape to get is started and lost a lot of tape in the beginning because it would not start properly and only half the tape came off. Then I had to struggle to keep the tape flowing as I taped a box together. Being a former Army wife I have moved many times and have used packaging tape more times than I would like to think about and this tape was the worst I have seen. It is too bulky, hard to start, hard to remove protective cardboard from blade. All in all I would not buy this tape dispenser again."
3,"Good tape, does what it's supposed to, bad dispenser","Good tape, does what it's supposed to, bad dispenser.This tape is way better than a lot of the clear packaging tape that I've used. It's nice and strong so that it only takes one or two strips to do the job. The only thing that kept me from giving it a 5 star rating is the dispenser. Like most of the others it's real flimsy and awkward to work with."
5,Scotch Tape is strong!,"I've tried different brands of packaging tape, but Scotch is the best! It always cuts evenly, so I don't waste tape, and it doesn't split. It works perfectly every time and it is super strong. I will always use Scotch packaging tape because it is superior to other brands."
4,"Great tape, okay dispenser","I've used a lot of packing tape over the years, shipping various boxes. This tape is about as good as it gets... nice quality, plenty sticky, not too thin, etc. The dispenser is okay too, and definitely beats a loose roll of tape and a pair of scissors. It doesn't deal very well with the sticky end of the tape though... it has a place to sort of put it until the next time you use it so it doesn't just fall back against the roll and make you pull it off again, but it could be better in this regard. What I like more is a good tape gun (like this one, which I use and love:3M Scotch Gray Box Sealing Tape Dispenser (H180)). If you send a lot of packages, I'd suggest investing in one of those: they cost a little more up front, but they are easier to use, quicker, and more effective, once you get the hang of them. Then you can just buy tape refills (like these ones:Scotch Mailing and Storage Tape 3650-4, 1.88 Inches x 54.6 Yards, 4-Pack), and save a little money that way."
4,I love the dispenser,So easy to handle. Great for sealing larger boxes shut without having to deal with scissors or the frustration when the tape sticks to itself coming off the roll.
4,Tape,"The title says it all: ""Scotch Super Strength Packaging Tape"" It is a very great tape for everything in your packing needs. You don't have to put a long strip,, just a small amount in the various areas of the box keeps it tightly held shut. I would not use this for anything but packing. I like other Scotch Tape for other things. The orange holder that dispenser works very well and I recommend using it. Do not try using this tape without it, your tape will get stuck to everything. It does work that well. I like it."
3,It's fine for tape but it's pricey,"I usually use a roll of tape from the 99 cent store and a loose razor blade for my packing needs. When I was able to get a roll of this tape to use I decided to give it a try.For a dispenser it worked well although I find using any tape with a dispenser to be a little cumbersome. The tape also doesn't really come off the dispenser so I'm not sure that I could reuse the dispenser which, if I can't, seems wasteful and is also a pain because this tape is expensive and being able to buy refill rolls would make it a lot cheaper.The tape is good, strong tape. It sticks well, doesn't tear and gets the job done. On the other hand, for five dollars less I can get a roll of tape that does almost as well without winding up with a pretty large piece of plastic to deal with once the dispenser is out of tape."
4,Gets the job done,"I've used Scotch packing tape products before, but never a dispenser for this size roll. Like the smaller dispensers I've used in the past, this dispenser makes using the tape a breeze. Just pull out the desired amount of tape, rip it across the built in cutter and you're done. I have no way to test the strength claims of this tape, but it does seem to be a bit heftier than the tape I'm accustomed to using, so it certainly seems likely that it would be stronger. The roll of tape appears to be a conventional size, so the dispenser can probably be reused."
4,It's some tape with a so so dispenser friend,"Firstly I was disappointed this wasn't a single Malt. You'd think a company called 'Scotch' would think their business model through a little more carefully.Now this packing tape is uber strong, more so than other brands I've so I used less when testing it thus saving lots of cash so I can buy more monkeys. Now it's sticky on one side - but here's the clever bit... it's not sticky on the other side! So your parcel doesn't accrue a whole bunch of unwanted fur balls, hair, other boxes and deck chairs during transit. And so when your package arrives it doesn't look like a Katamari Damacy ball. Very thoughtful of Scotch to give us only one sticky side.The dispenser needs work. Anyone willing to offer it a job?"
4,Classic Family Fun!,These are classic tales told by and All-star cast! Perfect for teaching today's children all about American Folk Lore.
5,America's Lifeblood.,"This is a perfect present presentation, with good humour, of the Icons who make up history. It needs no praise from me for it to be an absolute pleasure to all who visit with the characters who appear in this disc. You'll love it."
4,Grew up watching these...,I wanted to share these stories with my children the way I remembered them. I was so happy to find on Amazon.
2,More American historical DVD for grandkids,"Again, I think the adults enjoyed this DVD more than the grandkids. I don't believe I chose age appropriately so we will be tucking this one away for next summer too. Better quality though than what is currently available to show this generation of kids who are more likely to watch something than read a book about it. Granddaughter is 9 and grandson is 4, so maybe next year they will get more out of this."
2,Disappointing,"It's no wonder they don't make shows like this one anymore. My guess is that since the actors were already big stars, they didn't take this very seriously. As a result, I'm sure the directors couldn't push very hard. The different stories seem too long. The Storyteller series by The Jim Henson Company was 1000x better."
4,One exquisite song and one horribly over-arranged!,"I bought this disc originally just for the song ""Tom Bowling"" which provides the exquisite 'cello solo in Henry Wood's Fantasia on British Sea Songs which features annually in the Last Night of the Proms in London's Albert Hall, and which traditionally invokes much mock emotionalism in the audience. The rendering of that song is, fortunately, fine, but the usually beautiful ""Last Rose of Summer"" is ruined for me by a setting described in the sleeve notes as ""an elegaic, almost Purcellian grandeur""!"
1,Lello 4071 Replacement Bowl,"The bowl had to be returned. Unfortunately, the bowl did not fit my Lello 4070 Gelato Junior. It is slightly too large. I am waiting for the replacement bowl from Lello."
1,Wrong size,I ordered this and also got one that was slightly too large for my machine. Had to return it. I called Lello in New Jersey and was able to order bowls of the correct size over the phone. They were helpful and shipped my bowls promptly.
5,Great for Making Large Batches of You Favorite Frozen Treats!!!!!!!!!,"This bowl or bucket comes in handy for those times when you want to make large batches of ice cream!!I bought three of them to go with the original one that came with the Gellato Junior 4070 Ice Cream Machine!Keeps you from having to repeatedly wash the original bowl between batches, or having to empy and reuse the same bowl!!With extra bowls, you can prepare the icream mixture, pour the mixture into the bowls, chill in the fridge and make the ice cream one bowl right after the other.Cleanup is a snap!! Just wash the bowls by hand in hot soapy water. Do not wash in dishwasher though.~Daquan13."
1,Did not fit.,We purchased a Lello Gelato machine and decided to purchase an extra bowl. I had to return both bowls I received because they did not fit. Not a good replacement bowl if it doesn't fit.
4,Great,This is a great mixing bowl. Fits easy into the machine and you can put it in your freezer to store the product in.
5,It works. It fits. As it is supposed to.,"It's well engineered and made of good materials. It fits the ice cream machine properly - the machine has very tight tolerances, as it is a high quality product. Unfortunately, that kind of quality of machine and spare parts is a rarity. Bet you a fortune cookie that Chinese couldn't come close."
2,Waaay to small.... and velcro? Really???,"Ok, I must have overlooked something in the item description. It must be made for children. I'm a skinny guy (32 inch waist) and it didn't come close to connecting behind my back. There is also no buckle to hold it up. Velcro is the only thing which secures it in the back. It is a decent amount of it, but really??? Velcro never lasts long. I refuse to use it for anything because it's extremely temporary in its usability. So even if this did fit me I wouldn't have kept it for that reason.Other than that, if you have a young child who likes to run or hike, the water bottles do fit nicely. They're quite small but I guess that would be good for a child. If you're an adult I would recommend something else."
4,Good overview book,"This book is good at what it is intended to be: an introduction and overview of the different wilderness and wilderness study areas in New Mexico. No hiker/backpacker should rely solely on this book however, so if that is what you're expecting to be able to do, you will be disappointed. Each section describes the wilderness area, lists the basics (elevations, best season, map references) and lists a couple of hikes, and has a very basic map of the area with the trails, access roads, and campgrounds. Once you've found the area you're interested in based on the author's fantastic descriptions, you'll need to get a topo map of that area in order to actually do the hike (but personally, I'd rather carry a topo map in my pack that is specific to my hike than lug a book around). And no, the overall map in the front doesn't have cities/towns, but really, how hard is it to tell what part of the state you'll be in?"
4,Excellent summary of Wilderness Areas,"Despite reviews by people from out of state, this book is an excellent source of information on the Wilderness areas of New Mexico. I only hope they update it soon with any new information. This is obviously not meant to be a hiking guide and is not the reason i purchased it. Finding a good source of all of the wilderness areas of the state on the internet was troublesome, even for me, who surfs a lot. While i could get a good list of the wilderness areas out of the gazeteer, i couldn't get a list of wilderness study areas. The book also gives some trail suggestions which are very helpful, but in the end, i went to other sources. Maybe my honoroble friend from Colorado should stay up there and leave the wilderness areas of New Mexico to us."
1,Words of Advice,"At the close of his work, Quinn offers 140 words of advice to the notion that ""You don't have all the answers."" He should have left it at the five words that follow... ""Certainly I don't have them."" He clearly doesn't. This is a ramble of a book that is selfindulgence at its height. My best advice would be to not waste your time, the few times he begins to ask and discuss good questions (genetic predispositions of types of social behavior, social transmission of ""memes"" etc) he cops out and begins to pontificate and ramble on. I can see why it's out of print. I'm quite sure a few tribes would ""vote him off the island"" to quote another mindless mess. I guess this review makes me an evil ""old mind."""
2,What?,"Quinn's book was great until the last portion. He carefully crafted an opposing analysis of what civilization does for homo sapiens, presented his argument effectiviely, and then ended the book with a joke. And the punchline wasn't even funny. Although thought provoking, the book is a waste of time. There is nothing good in here that was not in Ishmael."
3,Beyond Civilization,"""Beyond Civilization"" follows the steps of Daniel Quinn's previous novel Ishmael. ""Beyond Civilization"" is a collection of short essays in which Quinn expresses his ideas and responds to questions of the readers. The essay's within the novel deal with various topics- ranging from ""how we should live"", school shootings, and the future of the world. However, all these topics converge to criticizing the present civilized society. In these essays, Quinn calls for a ""new tribalism"". This ""new tribalism"" is one that doesn't stray away from current technology and knowledge, but just use them different ways. I was intrigued by the thoughts that Quinn had, but feel that some are drastic and will never occur. Some qualities in today's society cannot be abolished and go away. We rely on them too much. I liked the way that Quinn broke the book into single essays. I gave the book three stars."
1,"If you read one book by DQ, don't make it this one","So, I'm going to give away the book:There's more than oneway to live.There's also more than one book to read, and itshouldn't be this one. The first book I read by Daniel Quinn was _Ishmael_. I found it to be profoundly moving. However, _BC_ takes a good 10 page essay about living live better and makes it into a cheap book. My advice: Buy Ishmael. Read it. Then read it again. Then read _When Corporations Rule the World_ by David Korten. Then you'll be itching to change the world."
5,As always wonderful and inspiring,"I don't know if you have to read 'Ishmael' or another one first, but I have to say, that everyone's of Quinn's books is a mind-changing experience. He says the right things in the right way and changes mostly the life of his reader forever. He did this with me and I will be thankful forever for this.So, this the last one I've read from him and although it's quite thin and very fast read, it's wonderful. Especially the things he says about revolution and the homeless are very striking.I can only repeat: Read every book from him and the ones he suggests. Don't be afraid. A better life awaits you."
2,Not Thought Out,"If you have an idea, but it isn't fully thought out, nor well developed, and decided to put those vague ideas into a book: that book would look much like this one. Short chapters that waste lots of paper that doesn't really say much. Attacks upon ""big programs"" that actually do work despite Quinn's protests. Make analogies about ""new ways of thinking"". Blame civilization collapse on a conscious choice to return to old ways of living. All of these arguments are suspicious.Better just to state this: We need to drastically reduce human impacts upon the Earth. We need to decrease our footprint, decrease our numbers, roll back the concrete, let vast amounts of land return to a primitive state and distribute the wealth that is left in a just and equitable way.Enough said."
1,Dismal and disappointing,"After reading Ishmael, one could only have high hopes for anything by Daniel Quinn. Beyond Civilization does not measure up to expectation. Quinn does a good job describing how we arrived at our current condition but fails utterly to paint a way out. Perhaps that is asking a bit much, but that is what ""Beyond Civilization: Humanity's Next Great Adventure"" promises but does not deliver. If anything, Quinn's ""new tribalism"" looks a lot like cooperatives from the 60s and 70s. The best examples he provides of a hopeful future is a traveling circus and embracing homelessness. I can hardly wait to explain to my children how the best hope is to run away and join the circus. Somehow I don't think this is the stuff the inspires revolution, or even evolution. Sorry, this one is a loser."
5,The way things are now is not how they will always be.,"Beyond Civilization is a bold step into unchartered territory. As he did so prolifically in Ishmael, Daniel Quinn illustrates how the successes of tribal life can be rediscovered and embraced within the confines of the modern world. This book continues Quinn's legacy of bringing hope into a seemingly hopeless future and by so doing, has marked the beginning of humanity's next great adventure."
2,Self Indulgent,"Some interesting ideas are presented, but the author's ego gets in the way of what he's trying to explain. I wasn't interested in reading about how successful his other books were and felt left out because I hadn't read them. His style is very condescending and I didn't get much out of the book."
2,Disappointing,"This book is a great disappointment. While Quinn does indeed do a good job of tracing a lot of our contemporary problems to ""civilization"", he offers no realistic way out. His proposed solutions have been tried and failed. Nonetheless he protrays his ""solutions"" as if he has masterfully delivered to us a great and insightful way out of our dilemma. That type of writing, in fact, is why I gave the book two instead of three stars. The thing that I found most annoying about the book is the tone of almost condescending certainty that he displays about his diagnosis of and proposed solution to our present problems. It reminds one of the arrogance of the ""academic elite"" whose tunnel vision and blindness to other viewpoints has helped to spawn our cultural crisis in the first place."
1,Beyond stupidity,"The fact that so many people seemed to like this tripe indicates that there need to be more courses in critical thinking in grade school. The author Quinn doesn't seem to have even a grade school understanding of science, logic, history or human culture. Of course since his audience apparently is educated solely from reading the Sunday supplement and the Oprah book club that is sufficient. Since trying to review this book requires more brain bleach than I have on hand I'll simply suggest reading:Fashionable Nonsense: Postmodern Intellectuals' Abuse of ScienceAlan Sokal , Jean Bricmont"
2,Disappointing for me too,"This book left me feeling very flat. I love the way he has written it and one page chapters are easy to read and the right thing for our short attention spans, but ultimately he just raises more questions than he answers. Then again, maybe that is what he strives to do. I guess the truth is that there are no easy answers to get us out of our predicament and we all, I think, need to take a good hard look at our own lives and simply figure out what we need to do to bring balance and functionality and awareness into the tiny circle that is our own immediate existence. I am giving up reading this sort of book. I really think our own answers are inside us, and we have to undertake the responsibility of figuring them out and acting on them, instead of looking for someone else to show us the way."
5,A Beautiful Begining,"After I finished this book (an hour ago) I looked in the mirrior, and said, ""you CAN do somthing after all"". A joy to read, I'd recomend it to anyone."
2,WONDERFUL alternative...,"Sorry I got my fill of all this anarcho-primitivist crap when I was an avid punk scenester. Sure let's all go live in subsistence communes while regressing away technology. Sounds wonderful ya'll. I am tired of hearing how this book changes people's lives. This old fart has to have some of the worse prose I have ever read.Daniel Quinn a futurist? I bet Umberto Boccioni would roll over in his grave if he were ever hear that absurd claim.Don't read this book, even if your girlfriend forces you too. Actually do read it in that case, so you can realize what a moron she is and then dump her.Pure garbage..."
2,Beyond Civilization.....Ishamael.....no! Beyond Civilization,"This is a very interesting book not in a good way. I thought it was interesting because I didn't know someone could get praise for writing incomplete and outlandish ideas. I found it very interesting that Daniel Quinn felt it was necessary to tell his readers about his other book Ishmael. I was caught between trying to find out if this book had a point or was it advertising for his other novel. Once you get pass all of the ads and autobiography, you find that Quinn has compelling views. What was very interesting was the fact that he praises tribalism but his ideas are very scanty. His ideas are not very well thought out. It's like he an idea ran through his head and he jotted it down without even researching it."
2,"Intriguing, yet something missing","Daniel Quinn's idea of Humanity's Next Great Adventure is to abandon civilization. Or maybe it isn't. He actually wants you to take your own initiative. Or follow his plan. Really, he's not even sure what he wants from you, and I think it comes through in his writing...he's not exactly sure what he's getting at, he fails to hit a definite point.He brings up some very good points, provides good examples for them. He wants us to change, yet he doesn't provide the means. Yes, he does say that we have to figure things out for ourselves. Unfortunately I don't think that's what people want to hear. His idealism is admirable and believable to an extent. However, when you begin to question the structure of his outline for anti-civilization...it seems like it would give in rather quickly. This book was interesting, but not concrete enough for me."
1,INACCURATE DESCRIPTION -- DON'T ORDER THIS!!!,"Even though the description says that it's for a pack of 6 rolls, I have ordered this item, twice, and both times (despite promises to fix it) I received only 2 rolls. Avoid ordering this item!"
5,Worked Perfectly. A real time-saver.,"This is a great set of tools and allowed me to quickly make sense of a really messy 200 port RJ45 patch panel. It also verifies if there is Ethernet service on a particular jack or port. It tests each wire of the cable for continuity. The tracing function helps to locate wires amongst a nest of wires. I bought it for just one job, but it sure paid for itself in the amount of time and frustration that I saved.I am not an expert in this area, so the product may have more functionality than I know about, but for the basics, it worked perfectly."
4,It works,"The narrow band scanning isn't near as specific as they show in their videos(of course) with a possible 8 from multiple lines or none getting an 8. That said, if you can unplug the jack and see the wire/port scan it will quickly tell you if you're on the right line.Note: this was done identifying CAT5 cable."
5,EXCELLENT PRODUCT AT A GREAT PRICE,"This is a really neat set of clubs for a child. The driver is a little on the heavy side, but otherwise the clubs swing beautifully and are very easy to handle for an average 10 year old. The putter is a simple design and has proven quite accurate. The bag is a heavy denier and quite rain resistant. It comes with its own built in stand and double shoulder strap for ease of carrying. My 10 year old handled this set very well. All in all this product is great value for money, good looking and gives a good game of golf."
4,kids clubs,An excellent starter set of clubs for a child new to the game. The quality of the clubs is very good. The price is right. And it was shipped very quickly. I was very happy with my purchase.
5,Perfect in every way,"Not a darn thing I can think of to report. They came on time. They shipped well. The product is exactly what a 5 & 7 year old (got the smaller set, too) could use and grow with. The price was exactly what the mom of a 5 & 7 year old was willing to gamble."
5,Youth golf clubs,"We bought a set for each of our 10 year old, twin grandsons. The delivery was fast (as promised). Considering the price, the quality of the clubs is outstanding. They are beginners and so proud of their new clubs that their game has improved in just a few days."
3,dPhilc's Review,"An interesting elaboration of myths found in ancient semite texts. It would be useful to the student of magick, so that she might appreciate the longevity of such matters running through relgious legends."
2,Disappointing,"I purchased this soap in part because of the good reviews for Canus products and partly because I had tried goat milk soap (another brand)and loved it. This soap is a generous sized bar, lathers well, at a good price. The problem is the fragrance - it's so strong that I will not be using it - and I bought a 12-bar package. Very disappointing; I will go back to Kirk's castile soap which is very mild, lathers nicely, nominal cost, and no unpleasantly strong fragrance."
1,Waste of Money,"Let's get this straight.This book from front cover to back is all sex. Their is no plot, the characters all they ever do is have sex. The dialect is cringe worthy. Oh and don't forget the no 'plot' thing. A spoon has more depth than the characters written in this book.I like my m/m erotica like the next person. But when their is a reason for it. The sex should be inter-woven into the story, not just plucked into every *single* page, and lets be honest the sex wasn't written all that well.The sequel is just as disappointing as the prequel. I had bought them both together and I really wish I didn't."
2,Can't get past the first chapter,"Why am I supposed to be gripped by the drama of this personal tale? I cannot get past the first pages, so full of history that I am completely bogged down in it. Is all this necessary to my understanding of the situation in that part of the world -- one which I watched unfold during the years it happened as I watched and listened to the media reports? Please, please, I want to like this book, but it just puts me to sleep. Maybe I should skip the first part that lays the groundwork and get to the personal experience part. Can I do that????"
5,about Elizabeth Neuffer,"Sadly, it must be reported that Elizabeth Neuffer died last week, while covering the war in Iraq. May she be at peace."
3,Interesting book but with mistakes,"Overall the book is a great read. It's clear that the author spent some time in Bosnia and is familiar with her material. Unfortunately there are many typos in the English portion of the book, as well as misspellings in the names of local people or places (Ceca, Konjic, et al) The portions on Rwanda are pretty skimpy. I liked the book, but the obvious sloppiness makes me wonder how many of her other facts are just thrown in without checking."
5,Moonbear's Friend,"Lovely, funny book. When our 15-month old son first the illustration of Moonbear eating honey, he stuck out his own tongue and laughed. He has since learned to ""play the banjo"" like Mooonbear. Asch's illustrations and colors are simple and appealing."
5,Entertaining,"When I was 11-14, I read nothing but CYOA books. I loved them. But, you know, I just got too old and sophisticated to read them. The other day, I was cleaning my room and came across this book. I read it for 20 minutes. It's still as good as it was back in 1996."
5,New No Limit with new Soldiers!!!,"After signing Weebie, one year ago, the New No Limit dropped Bounce Hits like ""Ooohhhwee"", but now they signed Choppa, and one of the best newcomers in the last years: CURRENSY!!! He's doin great Rhymes on that CD, I think the best one is on ""Holla"". The best Tracks are ""Who Run This"", ""War"", ""Grab Da Wall"" and other Tracks. Master P did good rhymes too, as well as Krazy did. I think that's one of the best No Limit CDs ever!"
5,tight dvd and cd,"yo dis thang up in herre iz hott i luv tha cd n da dvd it iz dere bezt cd i luv evry song on it mi top tree r tight whipz,we run dis and get bac n da dvd shows all dere carz n tha tight whipz video cop dis thang now homeboi!!!..."
2,Go Back To Lab,"I'm a fan of down south music and No Limit, but Master P has really done it with this one. This is a straight garbage album. No Limit hasn't put out a good album in years. The Last Don was P's last great effort. If P don't straighten up, no limit won't be getting anymore of my money."
1,they need c-murder and mac!,"Well these days, NO LIMIT is notdoing all that well. Master P's Gameface sold only 400,000 copies, not that impressive when you consider that Ghetto D topped 2 million. To make matters worse, the incarceration of two of their best artists-C-Murder and Mac- has diminished whatever strength the tank once had.The new 504 boyz project is a desperate attempt by Master P to put the tank back on the street. Unfortunately, the album lacks the creativity of the Cash Money releases. While Currensy can flow quickly, his verses lack the charm of verses dropped by Mac. A white boy named T-Bo is part of the group solely beacause of his race. Choppa has shown us that he can push units on the charts, but he too can't be compared to Mystikal.The project ought to satisfy NL fans, but true hip-hop heads will see right through P's pitiful scheme. However, if you enjoy down-south music that is authentic, try C-Murder's Life or Dearth or Mac's World War 3."
5,The Official Ghetto Bill is brangin his New crew back,"I am the BIGGEST fan of ~*Lil'Romeo*~ so i have to support my family.We the best we doin better and better.Don't care what them haterz talkin bout, cuz they cain't stop us we goin all the way this time.We stayed out fo a while and we back!!!! I Love Yall."
2,tight a** album,man this cd is cranked. i havent ben impressed with some of no limits stuff lately but this cd is worth buying. i think this is no limits best cd yet. every rapper on the cd is tight. i would definatly go buy this. its off da chains. this cd is soooooooooooooooo tight. go buy it.
1,Are You Serious?,"This album, like the usual No Limit albums, [are horrible]. Master P's signing of Choppa makes No Limit sound worse than it already does(especially with his annoying booty song ""Choppa Style""). And what makes it worse, each song sounds too much alike. Like Cash Money, No Limit's empire is crumbling so they sign another bunch of no talent rappers (Mystikal, C-Murder, and Mac were the only tight rappers on the label to begin with) to fill up their roster. I just can't believe that this garbage actually sells."
1,The garbage boys.,"Yet another poor and desperate scheme by master p to sell more records to a bunch of people who dont know any better.It's a well known fact that this guy is making money off of 2pacs beats and shows why they should change their label name to ""NO LIMIT GARBAGE"".There is no originallity or creativity in the lyrics and only the same old bling bling anthem.Has anybody noticed that people who listen to this garbage are all uneducated latinos,blacks and suburban white kids.Just look at the album cover and this alone tells you how much talent they possess.This trash sounds like it was put together in a week,thus not worth a penny."
4,Whodi you did it again!,"Master P and the 504 boyz did it again. Their new album followed up from Goodfellas is hot! Their first single Tight Whips have some hot beats and some tight lyrics. With some of the new arrival of 504 Boyz, they have stepped it up with Master P and have showed what they can do in the dirty south. 504 boyz will look like they will be the future of the dirty south and possibly the whole rap industry."
2,Unimpressive,"I purchased ""Empty"" not long after it came out and it was fairly enjoyable, but eventually forgettable, pop/rock. This sophomore effort is, simply put, amatuer and sub-par. Some of these sound like they would have been packaged more effectively as ""Empty"" B-sides, while the cover of ""Electric Avenue"" never really distracts most listeners from thinking ""What is this and why?"" Over all, this might appeal to most Christian radio listeners, but only because they will never scrutinize it for what it actually is: mold-fitting white noise."
3,Some Good Songs,"This CD is like most of the solo efforts of the DC Talk members. It is good, but not anything outstanding. Michael Tait along with Kevin Max and Toby Mac had an amazing thing going with DC Talk. It was a rarely equalled group that was head and shoulders above virtually any other group out there past or present. In contrast, as solo artists, the three are pretty good.Tait has some solid Christian lyrics. One of his songs, 'Lose This Life', is very good. The others range from ok to pretty good."
4,Great Ring,"Ring is actually nicer in person than in the picture. Not as heavy as I had thought, but this is a plus due to the size of the ring. I gave four stars, instead of five, only because it seems to run small. I have bought many rings over the years and am a true size 9. This fits like an 8 1/2."
3,simply tribal,"I had been looking for a tribal ring for quite some time. Then I found this one. Love this ring. Very tribal and quite unique. Comes with a reasonable price tag. Oke quality. My search is over (well, at least until I find something equally good:)"
2,Unoriginal; could have been better executed,"We have seen this kind of story many times: homewrecker arrives and slowly takes over the place, getting rid of anything or anyone in his or her way, until very few remain to fight back or tell the tale. The acting is so-so and the script lacking, but the production design is good--if that means anything."
5,The full experience,"Here is the ultimate collection for Karate Kid aficionados. Especially the pan flute sequences in the first and second movies. I was hoping to get the ""bone dance"" from the second film, but for some reason, that does not appear in this collection. This is all the orchestral background music and does not include the popular hits such as ""You're The Best Around"", ""The Glory of Love"", or ""Listen To Your Heart"". You need the other CDs of the movie soundtracks to get those. Still, the orchestral background for these films is mood making and beautiful to listen to. They cost me about $100 but you can't get this music anywhere else."
1,cost too much,"for those of you that cant afford it, dont beg borrow or steal to get this. this cost is outragous and unreal and only the rich can afford this.if you travel to japan you can get it for under 20 dollars and it has stuff thats not on these cds and the quality is better and it will make you fall in love with thekarate kid all over again."
2,Grohe escutcheon 07552000,"Review has nothing to do with the seller. Let me make that clear.The design and quality of this part is lacking. There were no screw on bolts for the""plastic"" shaft that hold the plate in place. The fact that the parts, other than the plate, were plastic was very disappointing. The plumber had to find bolts and also had to form the plate to lie flat on the sink. Grohe needs to re-think this part. On scale of 1-5, with 5 being good quality- I give it a 2."
5,Wonderful music!,I love this CD. Her music selection is wonderful and she has a voice like an angel!
5,Jennifer IS the new Star over Broadway,"Ballads Over Broadway is the debut of this new star - although you may have seen her on TV.She must be very private, there's not much to find out about her - but it's HER VOICE that matters!Best to all in the new year!"
4,Works As Advertised,"This product works as advertised. I owned the Maxell 8mm rewinder -- which was poorly constructed and tempermental -- and bought the Kinyo when the Maxell failed after moderate use. The Kinyo's not the finest piece of mechanical engineering either, but it seems to be much better made than the Maxell, and so-far does what it's supposed to for about 20 bucks. It runs on AC or 4 AA batteries. It is kind of loud, and takes about two minutes to rewind a tape."
1,You get what you pay for.,"The rewinder arrived promptly. At first I could not get the top to go down on 8mm tapes. I finally figured out that there is a little switch in back that depresses to tell the rewinder there is a tape in there and to activate the red light that indicates it is ready to use. The switch gets caught behind the tape cassette and won't let the top go down. You cannot bend the switch because it is plastic. Most times you have to take a knife and push the switch down at the same time you are putting the cover down on the rewinder to use it. The rewinder part works fine after you get the tape in, but that can be quite a hassle. I would not buy this product again. However, the price was great, so you have to weigh that out against more expensive units that may or may not have similar problems."
1,Disposable Rewinder,"This rewinder lasted maybe 4 rewind cycles before it stopped working. I opened the unit to repair it and discovered that all the internal gears / sprockets were made of cheap plastic with very loose tolerances causing the gears to jump out of track during operation. Once during a rewind it chewed up a section of tape. Lucky for me I only had a few cassettes to rewind and I was able to transfer the video from the damaged section. I wish I could say I got what I paid for with this product, but the quality is so poor that I can't even make that claim. I do not recommend this product."
1,This edition is NOT illustrated,"This is a small book with pages yellowing from age (cheap paper). There are a few line drawings, but no ""beautiful illustrations."" The other reviews obviously refer to different editions, and are completely misleading."
3,"Great Phone, But One Flaw","The designers added a lot of human-engineered common sense features such as auto-selecting the ringing line when you pick up the handset. Also, when one line is in use elsewhere and you pick up the handset, the phone selects the unused line. The buttons are large and well-labeled. The Voice Mail lamp works well.Caller ID has a quirk, though. Ocassionally, when the first ring is brief, it does not display the Caller ID. I have to go to another (different brand) phone I have in another room to look at the Caller ID. The Caller ID was in fact received; you can find it in the log. However, you can't get to the log via the Jog Dial while the phone is still ringing."
4,"This book educates, entertains, and challenges its reader.","Larry Swedroe's book is unique and worthwhile in that it educates, entertains, and challenges its reader. Mr. Swedroe has excellent technical knowledge which he conveys in an easy-to-understand format. He provides entertaining examples which bring his lessons into sharper focus and he challenges many preconceived ideas that many investors have and illustrates their flaws. I highly recommend this book for either novice investors or experienced ones; it will change your perspective on investing, and, in the long run, I believe it will improve your investment performance."
5,AN OUTSTANDING BOOK ON MUTUAL FUND INVESTING,"Who said by investing in index funds one has to settle for average returns? Why has Modern Portfolio Theory been explained incorrectly? Why does Active Portfolio Management underperform the market? These are some of the issues Larry Swedroe explains in his excellent book WINNING INVESTMENT STRATEGY. There is much more, too, such as Mr.Swedroe`s research going back to 1973 taking the reader through bull and bear markets. If you`re worried about risk Mr.Swedroe has an asset allocation just for you and shows you that you may get a decent return even though you`re risk tolerence is low. If you don`t know what your risk tolerance is, Mr. Swedroe has what he calls the The Stomach Acid Test which will guide you to finding the best asset allocation for you. Mr. Swedroe takes on a complex subject and makes the reading easy. He is to be congratulated for his effort. --------------Don S.--- Roosevelt Island New York N.Y."
4,A great book. Read it in one sitting the day I bought it.,Very insightful book on investing and the various fallacies that surround some of the media hype. I found it one of the most interesting investment books I have ever read. Would have given it 5 stars if there had been a chapter on index funds and had them grouped by the various investment objectives. Maybe even a comment about the strengths or weaknesses of some of the leading index funds .
5,superb,"I found Mr. Swedroe's book thoroughly engrossing. I have always liked to read books that explain complex topics to the general public and really appreciate when this is done well. This book does not disappoint. First it explains many of the concepts that I had heard about but never understood: random walk, effecient markets, asset allocation, rebalancing, variance, asset correlation. This may sound unintersting or irrelevant, but I promise you won't think that when you read this book. The book discusses Modern Portfolio Theory and explains how adding ""risky"" assets to a portfolio can actually decrease risk for the long term investor! It also gives usable advice on how the individual investor can structure his or her investments based on one's own risk tolerance. It is written in an engaging style without a lot of unnecessary verbiage. The author truly seems to care. In fact, he has subsequently answered many of my questions online at indexfundsonline.com. Thanks for all the help."
4,"Excellent Strategy, Could be used passive portfolio of stock","Very well written and easy to understand. The strategy proposed is not brand new (as he mentions), but clearly not well communicated. Anyone investing (new or experinced) should read as the principles outlined are vital to understand and implement. Although personally, I am not completely convinced the mutual funds are the only way to go as a passive portfolio of similarly balanced, well selected stocks should accomplish the same or possibly better results."
5,Was all I ever learned about investing wrong?,"Most investment books I've read are very formal. This, however, is an informal, easy-reading book that compiles the results of fundamental (but not readily available) academic research and experience: Modern Portfolio Theory. It's a book written for the average investor and will likely be controversial with active portfolio managers. Throughout its pages, Swedroe yells ""The Emperor has no clothes."" And he proves it too. When you finish reading you realize that all you ever learned about investments was wrong!"
1,Swedroe's book---The Only Guide to winning etc,I have not received this book. I understood it was not available. Was I charged for this book? Please let me know. Marvin Jaynes jaj3337@gmail.com
1,Where do I start?,"First, let me start off by saying that I love art films and horror films immensely. This is neither but rather we shut it off after about 20 minutes. Why? Senseless portrayals of killing animals for no reason that we could discern. Snapping a birds neck, not just one bird but three within the span of 20 minutes? And dead wolves? *Minor Spolier* Poking at a wolf in a cage and then shooting it point blank?? We shut this movie off at the scene where Julian Sands was killing the bird the mute girl just caught.WTF does this have to do with a serial killer in 1850 Germany?? If you respect and love animals - don't buy this film. Trading this one in...."
1,No more Sands please...,I like werewolves but I don't like this movie. This movie is more akin to werewolf dung than to werewolves. I also think Juilan Sands is a bore. How he is able to singlehandedly ruin a movie time after time confounds me. And what also confounds me is that he even gets hired to ruin a movie.
2,Unfortunate addition to Yarbrough's resume,"Mr. Yarbrough has a fine reputation as a leading judicial biographer: his previous works on Hugo Black, and the two Justices Harlan were impressive, detailed and interesting. With ""The Rehnquist Court"" he pumps out a minor achievement and a heavily slanted analysis of recent Constitutional decisions. There's no denying the hostility toward conservative/strict-constructionist judges and viewpoints and this, as a previous poster noted, deeply taints the work overall. In addition, Yarbrough's style (which has always tended to the dry and tedious) is here especially mind-numbing: the interesting constitutional issues under debate are hidden amongst irrelevant facts and long-winded prose. As a whole, I found the book very disappointing and the steep price tag wholly unwarranted."
5,excellent book,"i think if you go through this book you would realise justice is not blind but very racialy prejudiced i would prefer straight shooter brilliant jusice scalia,excellent book"
4,High Interest Reading for Teen With Limited Literacy Skills,"From the Back of Pacesetters edition -Gods of Gold Angry gods that had wiped out the people who had made them. Gods protected by the thick Borneo jungle . . . by snakes and leeches . . . and by Wet FireWere they still on the mountain?The Pacesetters series is high interest reading for those who have literacy problems, or who just have a reluctance to read. The reading level for these books is between 2 and 3. Many of these books are mentioned in reference material concerning High/Low materials."
3,The Bitch,"I first saw this film in the 80,s and at that time Miss Collins was a hot item.I then saw the dvd on amazon and had to have it.It is like this to see Joan Collins in something else besides dynasty and see her get down and dirty is priceless."
2,Didn't solve problem,I was hoping to be able to start my AC from a Honda GeneratorProblem is in the AC unit
1,i bought the changing rooms versian,on my 6th birthday i recieved the changing rooms versian of this because i live in england. and about 3 weeks later it broke.
5,Informative and Relevant,"I am currently reading this book and have found such hope from it. I was diagnosed last September with Stage IV breast cancer ..spread to my lung and liver. This book is one of the few that I could relate to. It is relevant to my situation, offering hope, comfort, and clear information."
4,Useful stuff,"My wife was diagnosed several months ago with Metastatic Breast Cancer. In learning more online about metastatic breast cancer we came across excerpts from this book, so we knew some of what was in it and we knew about the perspective. Generally, it's useful stuff, explained well. while there is a fair amount of literature available regarding breast cancer, not so much of it is regarding metastatic breast cancer. That alone makes this book helpful."
3,Original Battle of Britain?,"3 stars...otherwise five because of the end title music (when Sir Lawrence Olivier looked up in the sky outside of his office)...wasn't this originally a UA film?...the VHS was fine but, this DVD changed the end title music that isn't even from the Battle of Britain original movie soundtrack. The climax of the entire movie was that--and they blew it (It sent tingles up my spine). Are you listening MGM? Also Churchill's famous quote is curiously missing: ""Never in the field of human conflict...etc. What is going on here? My original ""feel good"" memories of this movie are now ruined (I first saw this great flick in the local theater in 1969 when I was 18 years old)."
5,Battle of Britain,"This shows how the outnumbered Royal Air Force out fought the Luftwaffe at the beginning of WWII in the skies over England, and kept England from being invaded. Great movie for WWII buffs."
4,Good in parts,"Lots to like in this famous and almost seminal movie about the Battle of Britain. The aerial combat is exceptional but the rest is mostly shallow writing used as a filler. Kenneth More is superb. Michael Cain is totally out of place with his imitation of a middle class British accent. He must have worked for weeks to say 'tally hoo' without a London cockney accent. All the best of British actors were dragged in to help sell the film: Laurence Oliver, Trevor Howard, Christoper Plummer and of course the late, very wonderful, Susannah York.Does it really recapture the feel of the Battle of Britain? I would say, 'no'. It tried to do too much. Less actors and more story would have been better. But certainly buy a copy for your library."
4,Excitement for a seven year old,"I purchased this as a surprise present for my seven year old grandson. He must have played it seven times with his friends & they are all busy building models of Spitfires, heinkels etc. It is an exciting action film - not always totally accurate but very engaging!"
4,Decent movie for fans,"I bought this DVD used for about $5.00 or so. I enjoyed it for the most part, but was disappointed with the dogfight scenes. You dont see any tracers, just some light from the guns, and then a plane usually explodes into clunky pieces. I like watching them stream smoke and plummet, not just explode. Still, great accuracy. I loved the scene with the Polish trainees breaking formation to attack the German bombers like a pack of wild wolves. That was very accurate, as this is the kind of maneuvers they did, breaking apart formations and singling them out. And of course, while being told not to they kept saying ""repeat please"" over the R/T. All in all, great movie, but it could have used more...""filling.""Jamie H.akaKrzysztof Kowalski305th Bomber SquadronPolish Air Force, reenacted"
2,Disappointing,I had high hopes for this film. So much so that I bought it without once having viewed it before. (clearance rack) I was sorely disappointed. The flying scenes are noteworthy. The cinematography is attractive. Other than this I can say little else positive. The story was quite thin with attempts to develop the characters and their stories only creating a disjointed and uninteresting bore. The film is touted for such a tremendous cast but very few of them are actually developed characters and the history of the battle is hardly revealed in the film. Olivier's 'what am I doing here?' look in the movie may not be acting after all.
3,Battle of Britain.,Unfortunatly the blue ray had the wrong area code. My adress in Sweden should have been a clue as to the correct code. However we all make mistakes. I have returned this itemto be changed to the correct area code which is 2B. In Sweden we use PAL TV system. I hope the same title will be available in the correct area code for me. Then I will make a new revue.
1,Region A,"I now understand what region A means {As an Australian I should now purchase my Blu-Ray discs from the U.K} when I purchased DVD I was okay as I possessed an all region player, then I puchased a Blu-Ray player however the goal posts had changed again and for some reason you cannot purchase an all region player for this system.I have now purchased 'Battle of Britain"" from the U.K as their system is ""A"" like Australia,however I will not dispense with the DVD because of the features present,I will not be purchasing too many Blu-Ray discs when I have to double up like this."
2,Wooden Characters & Dialogue Hurt Film!,"What can you do when your subject entails filming a very very limited number of original planes & mock-ups over & over again. Add to this a cast of very capable & some famous actors giving them wooden dialogue lines throughout. I would recommend Gregory Pecks film ""12 O'Clock High"" instead. Battle of Britian just does not hold up after 36 years!"
2,Incredibly flat,"This movie is flat. Shot almost as a doccumentary, its technical expertise was no enough to make you really care for the characters, because they are so distante and cool that they not seem real.So, the movie moves at a desperately slow pace. The soundtrack is completely outdated, it looks almost silly nowadays. Characters appears and dissapers all the time and, behind the fighter pilot's masks, you can't even be sure who they are."
3,What happened to thr rest of the movie??,"Great movie and superb acting. The aircraft used was unbelieveable. The instrumental. ""Aces High"" was the best modern march I have ever heard. It would have been very popular back in Germany during its time. In Europe it is also known as the ""Luftwaffe March"".But what happened to the rest of the movie?? There should have been atleast 20 minutes more as in the movie theaters when it first came out. Very dissaapointing especially when DVD companies seem to do this on a regular basis with movies.Keith T. Kalkanoff"
2,"Good aircombat, but little else","This movie has pretty good air combat scenes, but lacked a lot of historic detail, or that which it did have was poorly gone over. It seemed to me that every scene was accompanied by some theatrical music, which became quite annoying. Buy it if u want to see some nice combat shots, but if your looking for a good movie put your money elsewhere."
1,Battle of Britain DVD Blu-Ray,"I was not able to view my copy of this DVD that I received from Amazon. The reason was, it was only Encoded for Blu-Ray Disc Region A/1.Ilive in Australia which is Region B/2.So unfortunately the DVD was of no use to me. So I had to go to a local Video shop and order one from them. It would have been helpful if Amazon had taken my Region in consideration Region B/2 before sending out the product.Battle of Britain [Blu-ray]"
1,Poor Quality,"DVD is not enjoyable to watch.......stops and starts too many times to enjoy.....2nd time I've reviewed this DVD, still no corrective action.....would never buy from this person again."
1,"Unbeliavably tedious, one of the most boring movies ever!!","This movie has zero entertainment value. You have only to admire the producers efforts in terms of obtaining real World War II equipment for the movie. But, as far as the screenplay goes, it's so utterly bad, so boring, so tedious (and I'm a big war movie fan!). Some people say the director tried to say it like ""it really was"". But here was no need to have that slow pace, that ridiculous dialogues, characters that disappear without a trace, love plots that goes absolutely nowhere, tension close to zero! If it was not for the aerial battle scenes, one would not notice that Britain was in real danger!!"
2,Terribly Disappointed,"I had high hopes for this movie. I found it to be disjointed and the charactors didn't really develop. I felt nothing in the end.Try ""Twelve O'clock High"" or ""Dark Blue World"". Both of these films from different eras are fantastic."
4,British Action,Good understanding of what occurred during the battlesBritain undertook during WWII. Worth seeing for sure!Many planes involved in the encounters.
3,Wrong format movie.,Ordered wrong DVD. I don't have a BLU-Ray yet. But still same as other movie. Some day willbuy Blu ray player.
5,Battle of Britain (Collector's Edition),I have watched this film almost every day I have some free time. And the Special Features disc...Outstanding!
3,Battle of Britain Re-Visited,"A good movie of it,s time of an historical ww2 event.Really enjoyed Ron Goodwin,s music"
3,THERE IS MISSING FOOTAGE FROM THE ORIGINAL MOVIE RELEASE!!,"This is a fantastic film, but it has MISSING FOOTAGE, and it is a chopped up movie the way it is NOW! I wish to see this movie in WIDESCREEN, preferably on DVD, and ADDING the extra footage that is missing!! I am 62 years old, and I REMEMBER the missing footage when it first came out in the movies, and it IS in WIDESCREEN!!! PLEASE, PLEASE re-release this wonderful war movie on DVD and ADD the total missing footage! This will answer why some people watching this movie think it is choppy. Please give the public the entire movie as it originally was made! Thanks!"
4,An excellent recreation of aerial combat.,"As a WWII buff, I love this movie. The production crew went to great lengths to find the necessary aircraft and film them in some very well choreographed combat sequences. Add to this a number of vignettes based on actual incidents such as Adolf Galland's famous reply to a patronizing question from Goering or the activation of the Polish Squadron and you've got a great WWII movie. There is one glaring weakness though. The characters and situations on the ground are not at all compelling. So, if you want drama go elsewhere. If you want Spitfires and 109's you have found them."
2,ill-fitting mosaic,here's proof that some things are best left to documentary treatment - as brief as the Battle of Britain was - trying to encompass the entirety in a drama proved too much for the writers of this movie - the effect was like a poorly constructed mosiac rather than something organicthere are many movies set in the same timeframe with a narrower focus that convey more about those desperate hours than this high-concept big-budget one doesthe much praised air combat scenes might have been very good for 1969 - but suffer by comparison in this CGI erai wonder if the current generation of Brits can be inspired by watching this film
3,A must see,"They actually blow up vintage WWII aircraft for our amusement. What a travesty, especially since the explosions are all so similar.The cast of Brit stars is great, however, and it's a worthwhile trip down memory lane."
3,"a great air battle movie,but too unfocused",while this has some of the best air battles put on screen this movie is full of too many stars to keep track of the whole time so it leaves you cold! still the air battles are the best!!!!!
3,kind of boring,The Battle of Britain was very very important in the history of WW2. I remembered this movie from my teen years and wanted to get it for my grown children to see. My father lived through it as a kid growing up in England himself. He always extolled the virtues of the Spitfire fighter plane and the importance of the battle itself. The movie kind of made these points however the main thrust of the movie was mostly the aerial dogfights and attacking German bombers. These fights even though great cinematography in the 70's is crude to us now. Then there was too much of it compared to what should have been more plot and some kind of narrative of the history. The cast was phenomenal in its star power though.
1,Thanks...,...MGM for region locking one of my favourite films that I've been waiting to see on Blu-Ray for so long. This release has also been stripped entirely of the marvellous extras on the SD version.If the studios want to see this format take off they need to stop region locking certain films.Five stars for the actual film and a big fat zero for this Blu-Ray release.
3,It's finally here,"I too have been waiting for the DVD ""Battle Of Britain"" I still have reviews of the film from Air Power and Air Modeling mags discussing the making, accuracy, and errors of the film. Saw it twice in the theatre as a 13 yr old! On TV and VHS the small screen really hurt the ""feel "" of the movie. But now I here they've changed things in this release and didn't redo the sound track for DTS! Should I stick with my memories or get his modified version?"
5,Five Stars for the Vintage Aircraft,"Two-hour film about the courageous air battle over Britain when England stood alone against Germany in 1940. The movie follows history accurately and features an all-star cast that portrays the pilots, soldiers, and civilians involved. The real attraction of the movie is the aerial cinematography and there is no other film that has such a large assembly of vintage WWII aircraft. The aerial scenes are gorgeous with large formations of authentic Spitfires and Hurricanes mixing it up with Spanish-built Heinkels and Messerschmitts in aerobatic maneuvers: a terrific feature for military aviation fans."
2,Buy The Tape,"I should have read the reviews before buying the D V D.But as I have an old V H S copy that I love,I thought the D V D would be so much better.But the changes and omissions are very disappointing.Buy the V H S."
4,joygor,This movie made while the events were still relatively fresh in the surviving air crews. The air battles are terrific. Blue ray not as good as the orginial but then what is
4,A little dated,"This movie is appropriate to anyone interested in WW2 history but its style is a bit dated now. The director never bothered to developed the characters, the one or two ""human interest"" elements seem to be peripheral to the main story.But some great action and fighting scenes."
4,Movie review,"The Battle of Britton showed the historical facts and the human losses emotionally and physically. Although no movie can get it all right, this movie does well."
1,Wrong region,Unable to play as Australia is a different region should have been warned by amazon that blue ray have different zones
4,Best WWII flying sequences ever filmed,"The days when you could put a dozen airworthy Spitfires, and a bunch of Spanish 109s and HE 111s in the air to make a film are LONG gone. Not much of a plot/storyline, but the movie feels right and authentic due to the amazing flying/combat sequences that are unlikey to ever be bested on film. Great soundtrack too. The major characters of Dowding, Leigh-Mallory, Park, and Goering are very well acted and completely believable. The guy who played Goering is so realistic it's spooky."
4,Only for Collectionist,"It possible that it is not the best album of Sergio Mendes, nevertheless it includes a track difficult to find, it is Olympia track, because of this for me this album is only for collectionist or fans of Sergio Mendes."
3,"Mixed Bag of Disco, Pop, Smooth Jazz","This album is a major departure from the A&M; issued ""Greatest Hits"" compilation (for Mendez and Brazil). It ventures into disco (""Dance Attack""), pop (""Real Life"") and smooth jazz (the regal ""Olympia"" and children's themed ""Sound of One Song""). Only ""Morrer de Mour"" offers a glimpse at the same type of sounds featured by his band in the 60s (e.g. in Mas Que Nada).The mixture of styles makes for a bit of a disjointed album. The songs mentioned above stand out above the rest, though, and make for a pleasant listen.His 1983 ""Sergio Mendes"" album hangs together a bit better than this one."
5,Bury My Heart At Wounded Knee,I loved it and it made me cry for it was a sad time for the Bigfoot Clanand I being an Native American I am proud to be who I am
4,"Not Ken Burns, but entertaining","Maybe it was the hype of the Emmy's but I found this offering of the plight of the Sioux nation a bit of a let down. This is not to say that that this HBO production is poor, but personally I was expecting some 'bang for my buck', instead it was like getting beat up by a limp lettuce leaf!Maybe this is how history is, not romantic, but a series of misinformation, lies & tales of ordinary people doing ordinary things.P.S. if I was the Sioux nation I would've probably stayed in Canada & enjoyed the offerings of the extended ski season."
1,If your native don't buy this - Just for white folks only,"Firstly as a filmmaker and secondly as a Oglala Lakota/Northern Cheyenne human being from Wounded Knee on the Pine Ridge rez with a family background that goes way back, I watched 'Bury My Heart' today with some trepidation and really couldn't believe my ears and my eyes.Why would HBO get a guy from Canada to direct this US plains film, I will never know. His attempt at understanding a native worldview illustrates his ignorance and lack of depth. Shame that just when we as native people need more of our stories seen in mainstream media we get stuff like this.I would love to direct this myself. Watch out for my documentary 'Coloring the Media'Bad directing, bad dialogue and waste of great talent by a terrible director. My advice stay on that side of the border when dealing with stories that you don't really understand - better still use a Native Director. C'mon HBO get to grips with the 21st century.Mitakuye Oyasin!!!!"
1,Would have been better if...,"The movie itself was very slow to get going and did not make use of the talented actors in the movie. The politics that occurred behind the scenes sicken me even more. Initially Native American Writer, Sherman Alexie, was supposed to direct this film. Ten minutes after he was given the job he was called back and told they had decided to go with another director, Yves Simoneau. Please don't misunderstand me, Yves Simoneau is a fine director, but it is my belief that the job should have gone to Sherman Alexie who is more than qualified and brings the fact that he is Native American to the job. That provides a different perspective than that of a French director. In my opinion the movie was a watered down version of the book and I think it would have been much better had it been directed by Sherman Alexie."
3,"""Great but not so great""","My friend from Standing Rock (Hunkpapa) and I watched this one Wednesday after I got this show. He was not impressed; August Schellenberg just did not bring Sitting Bull to life. He was somewhat insulted by the portrayal.This show does depict early reservation life well, with the rations and the corral ""hunting"", and of course, the Massacre at Wounded Knee. However, wounded Knee was only shown in a brief flashback, and was not really explored firsthand. I was suprised, and my friend quit watching the show after about forty minutes. I think the director would have been better off to use someone like Russel Means, Floyd Westerman, or even Wes Studi as Sitting Bull; Schellenberg just didn't fit the part."
5,The cast makes up for the storytelling,"I admit to being a bit disappointed in the way the story is told but the cast is amazing and well worth watching. I also admit that I am a big fan of Adam Beach but all the actors are wonderful both native and non native.The important issue is that the story is being told and maybe more people will begin to understand why the U.S. owes Native Americans much more than they have given up until now. Maybe our new president, after he tackles the world issues, will actually consider the plight of the Native American and the despicable conditions on some of the reservations. He is the only major politician to mention Native Americans in his speeches. I hope he remembers them now that he is in office."
3,Unrespect to Dee Brown,"In first place, sorry about my bad english.I belive that this movie unrespect the original book of Dee Brown. The movie must be directed by a native american as say it by another review. I don't agree with the opinion of the massacre of wounded Knee was romantizised by Brown. This happend and the nortamerican autorities carry on in his back this terrible history.I suggest the cd Tribal Dreams to amazonians people."
4,Class,I used this product in my U.S. History class to show the events leading up to the Wounded Knee Massacre. It was an excellent buy and pretty good movie.
3,Boring melodrama,"This is a condensed version of what happened to the Lakota branch of the Sioux nation under Sitting Bull after the Battle of Little Big Horn intermixed with the story of Charles Eastman. The movie would have been better as a series in order to develop the characters into people you cared about and to flesh out the events. As it is, the story unfolds as an endless sequence of tragedies-gets boring."
3,"Good, but could have been much better","Overall a satisfactory rendition of Dee Brown's book but of course it could never match the detail and superb storytelling found within his wonderful book. It would be a mammoth task to create a movie with so much detail but it does provide anyone unfamiliar with the book a good insight into this disgusting episode of American history. I was a bit disappointed in the climax at Wounded Knee and found it to be all too brief and left me wanting more, much more. The acting though was great throughout and I've always admired the work Aidan Quinn does. I recently purchased the mini series ""Into The West"" and found this to be much more enjoyable."
3,A Decent Movie,It was a good movie that showed a part of American history you do not see too much of. It could have been a lot better if the movie did not jump around so much in the story line. The ending could have been a lot better as you had to read the rolling text to find out what happened to the main character.
2,Confusing,"Waterproof and spiral bound: great. Trying to understand the work out (I mean reading them): a pain. I am still trying to figure out how to read each work out (The swim jargon is a annoying, but I can flip through the pages. The lay out is just confusing. An brief explanation on how to read individual work out would have been great).Also, it's not for the average swimmer (even experienced Olympic triathlete). So a disappointment."
3,Swimming workouts,Although the book includes detailed workout. It doesn't include training program (the one in the book is not detailed enough) i think the book is more nice to have than essential training tool.The water proof papers is great idea.
2,Confusing--should be organized along the type of Triathlon you want to do,There's almost too much information here to pick and choose from. The codes and 'coach-talk' can be difficult to follow.This book would be more helpful if it were organized along the lines of what you want to accomplish as a triathlete. For example: (1) Sprint Tri: do 'these swim workouts.' (2) Same with Olympic and Ironman distances.She states '10 new workouts for Ironman distances' but then doesn't really state which workouts those are in the book.
4,Excellent Resource,"This is a great resource to use for 'mixing up' swim workouts. Great variety, nicely organized - you do need to read the abbreviations and descriptions to understand the workouts.I, due to poor eyesight, transpose workouts to MS Word and print in sufficiently large font, place workout in ziplock Baggie for poolside."
3,Not for beginners :(,"This book is definitely written for someone who has been swimming for a long time and knows all the abbreviations and swim jargon. I have been swimming for 3 years. I am not really a beginner but definitely not advanced. I am currently training for my first half ironman. That said, I found these workouts to be waaay too long. The workout I tried yesterday was 4400m. Maybe a very skilled swimmer can do that in the suggested 45 minutes, but 4400m is at least 90 minutes for me, which I just don't have for a single swim.This book doesn't dry, but I just keep it in my gym bag so that doesn't matter.There is a glossary included to help decode all of the abbreviations, but figuring out what the workout actually entails is like putting together a puzzle. Again, I think it is meant for the advanced swimmer."
3,Try The Waterproof Coach,This book appears to be similar to the Waterproof Coach: The Waterproof Workout Book for Fitness Swimmers and Triathletes published several years ago. The Waterproof Coach has more versatility because it's interior workout pages can be rearranged to create thousands of combinations of workouts.
4,Good book for Triathletes who need direction in the pool,"I bought this book after I mistakenly bought the newer, updated version that had workouts more geared for swimmers (different strokes, really high volume, etc). I am very pleased with the book, it offers direction and a plan for those who previously just jump in, swim 1500 and leave. The book has different types of workouts (endurance, speed, strength, etc)and has 2 versions per workout (one usually 500M less than the other). Each workout is 2000M-3500M, so it can be done in a reasonable amount of time. Waterproof pages are key as well"
5,Great workouts,"I was looking for something to help me structure swim workouts and this book was recommended to me by two friends who recently completed Ironman Lake Placid. The book is fantastic, you just pick out what element of your swim you want to work on and do the workout. I have seen marked improvement in my swimming abilities since using this book and would recommend this book to anyone looking to improve the swim leg of their triathlon."
4,Prevents mind numbing,I was always repeating the same drills and work out. This waterproof book guides through a number of different types of workouts to train at various levels.
4,Great Training Tool,"This book is a great addition to my training library. Not only does it have great workouts, the waterproof pages are awesome. You can take it to the pool and not worry about it being ruined by water. You can just throw it on the side of the pool and go. The workouts are easy to use and are very challenging. Probably the only complaint about the book is if the pages get wet and you don't dry them off completely before throwing it into your workout bag, they stay wet. But overall, great purchase!"
5,Awesome workouts,Great workout guide. Keeps swim workouts fresh. Binder is waterproof. Gives you plenty of workouts and mileage choices to guide you and keep workouts on task.
5,Luxurious Listning,"It is hard to believe that ~One Guitar~ is just so...1 guitar...played by one human being.Some how it seems the music melds back onto and into itself, making it's own simple elegant Flamenco symphony. It is clean, clear, smooth and immaculate. I found it most beneficial to leave it playing 24 hours a day in my room, while traveling, to think and dream by...very luxurious and healing to the senses. I find Ottmar Liebert to be an Artist worthy of the highest praise. Salute Sir! Only one thing would be more of a privilege to listen to, and that would be ~One Guitar~ in live Concert!"
2,I didnt like this album,"Although I have enjoyed other music from Ottmar Liebert, I did not like this solo album. In my oppinion all the songs sound the same and they lack substance. It would make fine elevator music, but not what I would want to listen to for pleasure."
4,Try something different ...........,"Well I went to my local music store to buy The Man Who by Travis and came out with Paddy Casey's Amen instead. This has proved to be an excellent decision. I was at the listening post listening to Travis and there were these soulful eyes staring at me from the cover so I gave up on Travis (sorry too much like a lot of other stuff) and tried this instead. If you like thought provoking stuff try this, kind of U2 meet 80s Bob Dylan but definitely not dated. Not exactly up tempo on all the tracks but I'm quite happy with my purchase and will be rushing along to Mall Music in Sydney this coming Sunday to hear him play in the coffee bar."
5,Third and best so far!,"This is an incredible mystery written by someone who is becoming one of my favorite authors very quickly. Each book in this series has been better than the last.In this story, Kathy & Brock are helping an old acquaintance (actually, an old nemesis of Brock's) with the kidnapping of his much younger wife. The twist is that the ransom is a rare stamp, a Chalon Head (hence the name). There are so many twists and turns in this book that it would be impossible for me to list them all but rest assured, it is not confusing at all, merely enjoyable to the last page.Congratulations to Mr. Maitland for another creative and well-written book."
3,Solid Procedural,"This is a solid police procedural. The latest installment in a series that is popular abroad, this book features two detectives with contrasting personalities and backgrounds. Maitland is a competent writer who has been gradually developing and enlarging the principal characters in the series. The character development and close attention to detail place this book above the usual run of procedurals. The plot, however, is somewhat contrived albeit clever. A solid though nor really exciting read."
1,Save yourself some money... here's an idea.,If you want a cheaper alternative use Saran Wrap. Why spend so much money just because it has an apple label on it?. My keyboard is nice and clean. When the saran wrap gets dirty just wrap it around again. May I add it's much more snug on the keyboard too!
3,Not Spain,"After a trip to Madrid, sampling the marvelous food in restaurants and tapas bars, I wanted to try cooking these simple and elegant dishes myself. This cookbook doesn't really satisfy my lonely taste buds, pining for Spanish foods. I tried four of them as accompaniments for Christmas dinner. It was difficult to find a variety of tastes that would complement the meal. My choices turned out to be pickles with herring and artichoke hearts, pickled onions, pickled cucumbers, pickled cauliflower. Many of the other recipes called for squid, octopus or mussels, not easily purchased in Kansas. I will keep looking for a cookbook with more variety."
5,This is the one&#65533;,I've been looking for something like this for a long time. All recipe titles are displayed in English and Spanish. Ingredients and directions are displayed in English and converted over to the U.S. standards of measure. This is very helpful. If you have ever tried to convert a full recipe from metric to U.S. you know what trouble that can be. Recipes are very authentic of the Spanish Tapas I have ever had in my short 4 years of living in Madrid. Recipes are easy to follow and to understand. Includes helpful hints to make cooking and clean up a lot easer. For Example: The correct way to turn over a tortilla with out making a mess.
4,A Good Introduction to Tapas,"This is one of Penelopes first books and in my opinion it rates a bit higher than ok. I don't want to be too harsh as the book is 20 years old but the downside is that it is poorly assembled with all of the photos at the center of the book and brief descriptions for each dish.Having said this there are many many recipes (about two on each of 200 pages) making this a good source of ideas and information, but if you're planning on flipping through looking for a photo of something appealing, this is not the book for you."
5,The little Dishes have big Taste!,Great cook book.- Easy to make most of the dishes. Guides you on what can be made ahead and what needs to be done right before.
3,Exotic but fiddly finger food,"This gives about 300 recipes for Tapas ranging from the simple (marinated mushrooms) to complex (stuffed pigs feet vinaigrette), quick (5-10 minutes) to slow (5 hours). All look delicious but many are time consuming to prepare and use lots of small ammounts of ingredients. The time investment to prepare a Tapas meal is significant and requires commitment.On the other hand, scaling up the quantities will give you great ideas for great tasting main meals.The major criticism is that all quantities are in pounds, ounces, etc and translating these to metric units used outside the US is a pain."
1,I got pregnant you can too,"Overall, very disappointing. Author has this grand idea that you can get pregnant just by having a better outlook on life ie: Marrying wealthy so you don't have to work while you are infertile, flying accross the country to the best doctors, going on spiritual journeys in Arizona. Some of the stuff was valid and mostly self-evident, eat healthier, start exercising, be aggressive on finding a good doctor and relax or meditate. My money could have been spent better elsewhere, sorry."
5,Provides a great mindset for becoming pregnant,"I too, laughed and cried as I read the stumbling blocks that Ms. Boland experienced. Having been told that I should have a hysterectomy and time was not in my favor, I was desperate to become pregnant. I had already experienced two failed invitro-fertilizations and was searching for alternatives. The advice, mindset, and processes Ms. Boland used-suggests are perfect. I think one can glean what works best for them. The upside to this way of thinking is that if the pregnancy does not occur you are in a state of mind that is much healthier and realistic without a feeling of extreme failure and consumption. Also, knowing that there are other women out there who have experienced the 'consuming emotions of infertility' made the overall experience much more manageable. I would recommend this book to anyone who is addressing the potential inabilty of conception and wants to create-maintain a 'positive enviorment' for getting pregnant."
2,I got pregnant...at what price?,"What a wonderful first page! I appreciate the author's positive attitude, and I and truly thought I'd found a book for me while I, too, struggled with infertility. However, I found it hard to relate to her difficulty in finding a decent gynocologist regardless of reputation ... and why stay with one you nickname Dr. Casanova! Also, I'm not in the same league as she and her friends: over a year of fertility drugs and IVF after IVF are not only totally against many doctors' advice but most people's wallets. But she lost me totally with her contradictory philosophies of communing with God and with crystals. I did like several of her suggestions for relaxing and getting healthy, and I'm glad she got her baby. Nevertheless, it made me really sad that she couldn't dedicate herself to any of her marriages the way she did to her goal of having a baby. Happy ending?"
3,Needed some asistance to install,"I neede the film aid solution to install, or you may need professional asistance to install it"
3,Incanto Charms,"I bought this perfume without smelling it on me, because someone else was wearing it and it smelled good on her. I smelled it right after she sprayed it, though, so it was a bit strong at that time and I wasn't smelling the dry down. It's a pleasant scent, but I prefer Escada LE perfumes to this one. I also have Incanto Dream, which smells more like the Escada LEs, but has a somewhat cloying dry down. The Charms dry down is better. I just wished it lasted longer, because the smell disappears within an hour."
4,Great tool for network of phone wiring,This is a great tool to use to test your cables. It will save you countless hours if you do wiring or have to check the wires of others. The only reason I took one star away was the price of the unit is a little higher than some others and it only comes with one remote.
3,Leica digilux 3,"Hmmm,'AMAZON, I dont get it. How can a Leica digital camera, ( the Digilux 3) that I bought a year ago go from $1,200 go to $3999.????? It has good ratings, but not great. It is not a collectors item. I think it is not a bad camera for 7.5 MP but my Nikon D-90, new at the same price,is the same price new, and much better, I say that mindfully as I love Leicas.. well... you'd expect a bit more from a Leica.But the main thing is, how could you let it be sold less that a year ago for $1200, then jack it up to $4000.? It's interesting, I sent it back for a repair, and they decided to refund my money, not repair it. ( very simple repair) They said there were no more being made/available. I guess they wanted to sell mine instead.I""D BE VERY CAREFUL ABOUT BUYING IT FOR $4000.!"
1,It's not a Leica....,It's not a Leica and don't buy it you think you are getting Leica quality you aren't. It's just a Panosonic with a faux red dot on it.Forty year Leica shooter and not fooled by this.
2,not spill proof,this item will keep drinks cold but it is fine if you have it in the car in a cup holder for long trips but if you intend it for a child to take to school it spills all over their lunch box
1,Can not find replacement parts,"This thermos works well and would be a long-lasting product. However, they do not sell replacement parts for the straw assembly. Our straw tip (tiny rubber piece) has torn and the thermos is now unusable. It seems ridiculous to throw away a $15 item over a 5 cent missing part."
1,Funtainer beverage bottle,I bought a funtainer beverage bottle for my 6-yr old to use. I must have gotten a defective product because it just keeps on leaking even the bottle is only half full. I am disappointed to say that it had to be returned.
2,frustrated wtih design,"We really love the way this product keeps drinks cold however, the design of the top is poor. The thermos has rolled off my 6 year olds desk twice and the hinge area of the lid has broken both times leaving the straw uncovered and the lid useless. I have replaced it for a third time but won't send it to school or on field trips. The company didn't seem too concerned about the design flaw either, but was willing to send me more replacements parts for a cost with shipping and handeling. I've spent more on shipping than on the original thermos."
1,Chocking Hazard?,"We wanted to find a straw bottle that does not have BPA. We decided to give FUNtainer a try. We went ahead and bought four of them.First couple of days were fine, but on the third day, our toddler bit down on the straw, cutting it. Thank goodness we were there to pull the straw bits out of her mouth.This is the first time anything like this has happened. Is the straw weaker than those that we have used in the past? Not sure, but possibly. The other day, I tried to pull the top straw piece out, and it split in half.Anyways, please be watchful... The straw is easily broken into pieces, and when it does separate, it is a possible chocking hazard."
1,Shop Elsewhere,This sweater didn't work for our dog. He didn't like the feeling of being wrapped up. When we tried to return the purchase we were unable to get a full refund as this company does not provide them. We at first received a canned response from the company and a picture of the item as returned that didn't match what we sent in. We asked them to reconsider and got a short snippy message in return. This product is widely available. Do yourself a favor and buy from a company that won't make you regret doing business with them.
1,Cheap Junk,"I bought this rewinder to replace an Omega 2 way ff/rw that I only had for a year. Initially with this and other rewinders, they are rough with tapes. Slamming at the end of the tape rewind isn't too good for a VHS tape over time. Along with this, the tape ends up looking unevenly wound throughout the reel, and in some cases the outer edge of tape, about 10 minutes worth, is buckled causing tape damage, and a nice buzzing tracking line down the screen upon playback. The concept of having a rewinder makes sense, because it does save wear & tear on the motor of your VCR, but the trade off is that you end up with damaged tapes. I returned this rewinder and just bought a basic JVC VCR to use as a rewinder. It's gentle with tapes, and gears down when it is coming to the beginning of the tape, unlike this Kinyo rewinder and others in this product line."
3,Satisfactory,Have only used a few times but it seems to do exactly what it was designed to do. Thanks for supplying at a good price
3,One Huge Drawback,"One of the best and smallest APS cameras out there. But there is one drawback which you should be aware of before purchasing. Unlike some other APS cameras, this one does NOT offer mid-roll film change. This feature allows you to switch from 200 to 400 film in the middle of a roll depending on whether you are indoors or outdoors. It is a wonderful feature which I wish this camera had."
4,Fantastic pictures!,"The camera takes clear, crisp pictures in every mode and lighting condition, is very lightweight and easy to carry along on trips. The only downsides--the button to switch flash modes is tiny and sometimes tricky to use, and the pop-up flash stuck inside the case a few months after we bought it (though it was promptly fixed by Olympus). I'd recommend it to anyone!"
4,A great little camera!,"We bought this camera in June and have taken several rolls of fim since-trying it out for a trip to Ireland in a few days....so far, I like it a lot. I do wish the instruction booklet wasn't printed in every language known to man....it makes it hard to find what you're looking for fast. I came to this site today to find what kind of battery to buy-I swear I couldn't locate that info in the booklet! (Could just be me, tho'!) At any rate, I would recommend this camera-it's so light-just perfect for travel."
3,THIS COULD HAVE BEEN A REALLY GREAT LITTLE CAMERA,"When I first bought my Olympus iZoom 75 I thought it was a great little camera. It's light, sleek, weather resistant, aesthetically appealing, plastic but apparently well made, has quick flash recycling, and has a faster than average lens for this camera type (f4.7). Unfortunately I soon became disenchanted for the following reasons: 1) Slow opening and setting-up time 2) Quasi-manual open and close 3) Slow zoom action 4) Non-ergonomic function buttons (except ""shoot"" and zoom buttons) 5) Worst of all; that trademark ""strobing"" flash, which makes true candid shots almost impossible, draws unwelcome attention and slows down functioning. I ended up giving this camera to a friend.(Who likes it) Considering the many fine features of this camera, and Olympus' impressive track record over the years, it's especially disappointing that they didn't think this one through a bit more carefully. This could have been a really great little camera."
2,Poor Reliability,"I bought this camera 2 years ago because of its compact size, APS features and the Olympus reputation. It does take good photos, and has almost every auto feature one could ask for. However my camera has experienced very poor reliablity and excessive use of batteries, compared to other autofocus cameras I have owned (Canon Elph, Pentax IQZoom, Canon Telemax). Without much hard handling or outdoor use, it has been serviced twice (defective lens cover/on-off switch, and shutter button failed). The red-eye feature results in excessive flash lamp discharge, and makes it hard to pose subjects, and uses batteries faster. Olympus factory service for each non-warranty incident is $$. Needeless to say, I didn't have it repaired the second time."
3,The Olympus uzoom 140 take much better photographs.,"I bought this camera on the strength of the recommendation from the shop owner. Its very compact, weather proof and easy to use. However I am not altogether happy with it for the following reasons. (a) I don't beleive that APS is as good a film format as 35mm, (b) the buttons are not very ergonomic, (c) it can be difficult to keep the subject your are shooting in view when you depress the button due to the cameras small size. I would definately only buy this if you have small hands."
2,"Good Camera, but uses APS Film and reliabiliity in Question","Overall, if you want an APS camera, this one would be good. However, APS film is more expensive to buy and more expensive to develope (slightly), so I would look into a compact 35MM camera also. My camera performed well, but after a few years, the film slot won't open (jambed or something) , so I have abandoned it with a full role of film in it. Not worth fixing it."
2,Doesn't repair disks that are tiling,"My older son is gaga over Men in Black II, but my 3 year old son maybe bit the disk. We ordered the Maxell Pro Disc Fixer DSR-1 and waited with baited breath until it arrived. When it did arrive, I noticed a chemical smell - we had the same fluid leaking problem another reviewer had.Before my 3 year old chewed up the instructions, I noticed that at the bottom it says ""THIS PRODUCT WILL NOT REPAIR TILING ON DVDS"" and shows a picture with big pixels on it - not something I'd seen in any of the information I saw before ordering the device.Also repeated in the instructions several times is ""DO NOT TOUCH PADS!"" Well, for my hands, it is physically impossible to pick up the pads using only the crossbar you're supposed to use.Oh, and BTW, the website given for help/information on the package doesn't exist."
1,Look elsewhere,"I bought this from Amazon, it arrived, I used it to try to fix two discs. The product seems to work only closer to the center and does not do much on the outer 3/4"" or so. It has you use a solution in one of the steps and you are suppose to put on 2 or 3 drops, which I did. I placed the disc back into the machine as instructed. After the required 3 minutes of spinning I opened the cleaning unit and removed my disc. One of the drops had not even been touched. So, not only is it not fixing my disc, it can't even remove a drop of fluid.Also, there was some kind of contamination on one of the discs. It looked like a stain about 1/4"" across and I was hoping this device would clean it off. It didn't. Having nothing to loose, I put some Windex on it, rubbed gently, and the spot went away.So, some of the scratches went away, they were near the center, end of story."
2,Will fix disc's great but...,"I have no problem with this product as far as fixing disc's. But I bought this product less than a year ago and it's already broke. A consummer is suppose to get a 100 cleans and fixes out of it before you need to order refills, but do not believe that either. I called and complain to Maxell USA about their product, however they only cover this product for 90 days. I left a complaint with them but they told me there was nothing that could be done for me. They seemed to be not interested on if there was problem or not with this product ""so buyer beaware""."
1,Complete waste of money,"This product seems to be more expensive than similar products that do the same thing. I have no clue why that is. This thing does NOT work for repairing discs if the scratch is near the outside of the disc. I've tried to repair a disc several times and the scratch is still there each and every time. If the scratch is more towards the center it will be repaired. It does just fine cleaning discs, but not repairing them.I bought an Optifix unit and repaired the same disc and it fixed the problem on the 2nd try."
1,Unreliable Manufacturing,"I bought this in November and used it a couple times. It worked on one disk and not the other. I went to use it again and it stopped working. I then called Maxell and it only has a 90 warranty. So I am feeling ripped off and angry. Oh well, that'll teach me to buy Maxell anything."
1,No stereo!,"I can't understand how they can call this Hi-8 without a stereo output. Even if the picture is a good as Hi-8, sound is important too! The S-video connector is not compatable with the connector on my capture card. I'm sending mine back!"
2,Hitachi has taken a step backwards!,"This unit is barely featured enough to call it a hi8 camcorder. I remember when Hitachi was considered a high end manufacturer but this tells me they want to waller with the Samsungs, Daewoo and other low-end quality companies. The best low dollar hi8 comes from Canon with many features. Hitachi needs to step up to where they were and let the others be."
3,"Murder, lite on the caffeine","Well I don't know why people are so enthalled with this series, but I think if you are looking for a really fast read, without much suspense but great coffee receipes, you will enjoy this. If your taste runs to more complex, sophisticated mystery, keep looking! Sort of Murder she wrote meets Starbucks."
2,disappointed,I liked the first three in the series--but this one is farfetched--character is acting irrationally and has lost her original freshness.
5,Love this cute series,"This series gets better with time.I really enjoy the interchanges between Clair and her Ex.Funny escapades and plot keep it a item to look forward to.,"
2,Not her best,"A little tedious, a little contrived, a lot unlikely. Glad I finally finished it. Sometimes Clare is just a little too meddlesome."
5,Leisure reading,fun mystery series. Humerous too. Highly recommend this book and all of the rest of the books in the series too.
5,"The best one yet, but I have no doubt the next one will be better, and so on...","I have read all these books in order, and I think like most writers Ms. Coyle's writing has improved with each new story. She has created wonderful, likable characters and you just don't want to put the book down. Coyle uses sharp dialogue and strays from the typical mystery faire. I absolutely love coffee, and I must warn you, you're going to want a good cuppa while you read this book. It's a lot less coffee oriented than the rest of the stories, but Coyle still manages to educate her readers with a tidbit of coffee trivia she has not yet revealed. My only complaint is that Clare often thinks of Det. Quinn, and calls him once for his professional opinion. He promises to look into it and then he's sort of obliterated from the story. I also wish we had a bit more of Madame's character, she's one of my favorites. Other than that, I was sorry when the story ended. Hopefully I won't have to wait too long for the next one."
4,Coffeehouse Mysteries,"This latest in the novel series is the best I've read even, and enjoyed immensely. Please encourage other new coffehouse/special treat mysteries similiar to this one so I can continue to obtain them as well - how else can I learn aplenty in the corporate side of those treats? Thank you so much from Laura A. F."
2,Idiotic Heroine,"It was hard to like this book when the heroine was such a complete buffoon.Clare decides the murder attempt was meant for her friend for no apparent reason. She decides the police are incompetent and unwilling to see her point of view before they even arrive on the scene. She then proceeds to investigate on her own, doing idiotic things like swimming out to an unlighted boat by herself at night to follow the person she thinks might be the murderer and breaking into someone's house because she's nosy. The whole thing was just so unbelievable and stupid that it made it hard to even care.I hope the next installment is better."
2,pagan fleshworks,"Any one interested in pagan culture, neo-paganism or wicca this is NOT the book for you. It should have been titled ""Punk Fleshworks"". If you are interested in the current punk-rock scene and body art then this will be of interest to you and well worth the read."
1,"A ""true"" Tale of Fiction","I looked forward to reading this book, but after finishing it, I felt duped. I can't remember the last time that I read a book of non-fiction that I so completely disbelieved. I believe that Mr. Fletcher climbed an Alaskan mountain and met a bear, but his Friday the Thirteenth style description of being stalked by a grizzly can't be true.In addition, his cheerful description of toppling a rock spire just for the fun of it indicated a rather cavalier attitude towards the beautiful environment he professes to love"
3,A True Story?,"This is not so much a review as a comment/question.I have, indeed, read the book, and I am troubled by some of the events and details described.Fletcher describes the damage done to his backpack by the bear, and this, alone, is enough to make me doubt the non-fiction status of this book. A grizzly does, indeed, have large claws, but they are not particularly sharp, and would not leave five clean rips in the material as described. Nor would one of the claws puncture his boot unless the boot were pinned against some object.I am very skeptical of the ""facts"" as recounted in this book."
1,"Wish ""No Stars"" Was An Option Here","I normally do not write negative reviews, clinging to the adage ""if you can't say something nice..."" but people should be warned not to buy this awful piece of fabrication. Where was the editor? The fact checker? There is no way anything descibed in this book is even remotely true.I can't believe the publisher put this completely unrealistic, badly written fairy tale on the market, much less promoted it as a true story.A slap in the face to anyone who has ever actually climbed a mountain, visited Alaska, or seen a real bear.Shameful."
1,At Best An Excessive Embellishment,I eagerly purchased this book based on a review in a magazine. What a mistake. I suspect the author had some sort of encounter with a bear and then dreamed up a story that somehow made it into print after 22 years. A bear would not behave as portrayed in the book. The circumstances of its demise is laughably unrealistic. The choices made as part of the climb are not those of an experienced climber. I expected much better and am disappointed a publisher would have so easily allowed nonsense to reach print in the form of a serious book.
2,Not the worst I've read,"This book is pages and pages of dull description of ice, snow, what the author had for lunch, dinner, breakfast, how he great felt about mountain climbing solo and how he didn't need food drops... etc. Once in a while, you get thrown a bone with a couple of pages about this crazy bear who has it in for him. Some of the descriptions of the bears actions are far-fetched and almost too human-like. I found myself not believing the story... not because it was so unbelievable, but because it reminded me of a tall tale. The ending was abrupt and let the reader scratching their head... about why they bothered to read it.I found myself skipping MANY pages to get through it. I wouldn't recommend this read to anyone."
2,unbelievable,"I love true stories, especially man vs nature true stories. However, I found this one flat out unbelievable. I felt let down and tricked. My intuition tells me this story is a tall tale. There is nothing concrete to justify my doubt just an overall feeling you get when someone is putting you on. That in itself would be okay if the tale was soooo good that it wasn't a waste of your time but unfortunately it is not. Luckily it is short."
1,Unbelievable!,"I don't buy the story. The author may have done this climb, but the bear story is a classic tall tale. There is just too much happening that can't happen. Mr. Fletcher knows climbing, but for someone who supposedly has climbed in Alaska before, he doesn't know much about bears. The most hilarious scene (after the one where he supposedly kills a grizzly cub by throwing his ice hammer at it)occurs when the bear rears up on its hind legs, jumps across a creek and charges him RUNNING ON TWO LEGS! Enough said. The most amazing thing is that he was able to sell this to a publisher here in the US. Revealingly, Amazon UK is selling the book in the ""fiction"" category, where it belongs. Accepting it as such, it does get quite suspenseful at the end."
4,"True or not, a good story....","While I do have doubts about the veracity of the story, I still liked the narrative. I think it could be true...but even if it isn't I enjoyed to book...and that is all that matters for me...so I would recommend it for anyone who likes adventure writing."
4,What a story!,"Very interesting story, but what poor writing skills. So, if you don't mind poor grammar this book sure is an interesting read."
3,"Good thriller, but hard to believe","I don't know very much about bears or bear behavior, but fortunately I do have enough common sense (and it doesn't take much) to realize this guy is fudging on his ""true story of survival."" It was still a good suspense book though."
2,Never happened!!,"I lived in Alasksa for 1.5 yrs and knew plenty of people with Bear knowledge. Grizzly bears in the interior of Alaska do not grow this large, or hunt humans for revenge.. The book maintained my attention but also is a crock! Also this guy almost died on several occasions and remembers every detail! Give me a break.!"
1,No stars---read Jon Krakauer instead.,"Don't bother reading this book...unless you're rooting for the bear. The narrative is poorly written and filled with the European male explorer arrogance of ""first"" ascents. He claims to have not intended to kill the cub because of his great respect for nature, yet at every turn is cracking towers, rolling boulders down cliffs and stealing crystal from caves. I just feel sorry for the cub who died at the hands of such an idiot."
4,"thrilling story, true or not","This story would make a great movie! I'm not so sure all the events described are 100% accurate, but this much is true; once you begin reading this book it will be difficult to put it down. If you like adventure and edge-of-your-seat thrills then you will surely love this book."
5,get this cd,"First, I was really delightfully surprised by the quality of the recording. It sounds great. & the songs on this cd do often sound different from studio recordings. There's even some really great new material on this cd that I don't know from anything else by Neubauten. Great cd, worthwhile, recommended."
1,Missing Parts,"This item would of been just find if Amazon hadn't shipped me one that was missing parts. Then putting me through the hassle of having to ship it back. I guest Amazon doesn't give a hoot about someone's time, and that's what I thought Amazon was all about. Thanks Amazon for making me box up this item, make a trip to a UPS drop off, and tying up my money for a week or two.One very disappointed customer, Bob Crawford , Indy"
3,"a drunk husband, no birth control and a subservient wife","In the 50's and early 60's a wife who is also an excellent word smithenters contests and wins to keep her family going.The Catholic family priest is an old Irishman who is really no help at all.Against all odds Evelyn Ryan wins many major contests just when she needsto.If she hadn't bought into the creed of her time,she might have been a successful writer instead of a struggling house wife?I thought the movie was a very sad story:her drunken abusive husband needed to be dried outand the family never got the nerve to face him on it untilit was nearly too late?"
2,A disappointment!,"It looks like the other reviewers loved this movie. I was disappointed in most of the aspects. The whole movie was very suface, trite and didn't connect me to any of the people in a meaningful way.The mother was protrayed a bit too perfectly....like a wax figuire of sage advice and an almost brainless optimistic idiot. So many times when the jerk of her husband was pulling his violent BS...I wanted her to get a backbone and say something, ANYTHING. And the whole deal with her driving. Why all the drama? Why did the daughter have to learn so she could drive her too her meeting? Why didn't the mother just learn? Confused me.This could have been a great movie, but the performances were mostly wooden and fake. Moore is on my top 5 favourite actress list, so perhaps I was expecting too much. She just zombie walked through this one."
2,A clichè. Very bad movie.,"Nobady coul save this movie. Even Julianne Moore (the best actress around). The story pretend to be one spoon of sugar and one spoon of poison: Julianne Moore & Woody Harrelson.Harrelson is a great actor, is not his fault. The problem is the directing and the own story: they are very light, in the border of the stupid thing.Casting and art are beautiful."
4,Prize Winner of Defiance Ohio,I had picked up a paperback with this title and when I found the movie I had to buy it.The movie was very close to the story line of the book and worth watching.
5,An Unusually Moving Film,"I cried through part of this movie and I am not much of a crier, least of all in a theater where someone might see me.Moore kindled deep empathy and hope in me as I watched her radiantly portray a remarkable woman. Harrelson made me all but hate his character, and I am not a hater. Both leading characters gave outstanding performances.Other factors converged to render this film a moving experience. It was based on a true life-on-the-edge story, which took place fairly close to where I grew up. Finally, the young children praying in the closet put me over the top.Although the Christianity in this film was only touched on, to me the handwriting was on the wall: God is a merciful, faithful, and miraculous Provider.This is one of the most inspirational films I have ever seen. Highly recommended."
5,"Beautiful movie about ""every"" wife, mother, woman","I just saw this movie on dvd. I cried a number of times because it reminded me how strong women are in this world, in particular, the wives and mothers who support the family. Julianne Moore is wonderful. Woody Harrelson made you sympathize and hate him at the same time. Watch it and buy it for your mothers."
4,EXCELLENT FILM WITH JULIANNE MOORE IN TOP FORM!,"This is one of those love it or hate it films, it's certainly has a style all it's own. The nostalgic story of a mother of ten with an abusive alcoholic husband is sometimes funny, inspiring and sad. Julianne Moore gives a wonderful performance in the lead role with excellent support from Woody Harrelson. Never one dimensional, this little movie works on so many levels, it deserves a place in everyone's film library. Hopefully the price will drop on this little gem soon!"
4,better quality but not perfect,"It has a few spots from bad film processing,every once in a while you see black spots where the developer had bubbled and not made contact with the film surface leaving black spots every so often.It can be fixed with digetal editing touch up the spots in the digetal video processing.I know about those fixes because I studied computer animation in school and I used to work in a film processing lab.seems like they wanted to improove it but not put the money into making it look flawless.I didn't notice those spots on the cheap Echo Bridge copies on standard def. just on this blu ray."
4,found the sequels to be better,"I saw most of the sequels to Puppet Master first and recently saw the original, mainly because it is so much more expensive. For once I think the sequels were better than the original. If I had seen the original before the sequels, I might have liked it more, but to me it just doesn`t have the punch of the sequels."
4,A good soundtrack. A great film.,"When I first saw the trailer for this film I figured the soundtrack was something thrown together just for promotion. It's not. For one of the first times since Baz Luhrmann's ""Strictly Ballroom"" the Australian tie-in soundtrack reflects the feel and core of the film. The Italian influences of the Alibrandi's in the opening and closing beats of the film - ""Tintarella Di Luna"". The sadness at the losses - ""With or Withouth You"". The 'schoolies' theme - ""Weir"" by Killing Heidi. Then the hidden gem of the CD - the awesome ballad in LoTel's ""Teenager of the Year"". It's as good as any of the teen flick soundtracks out there. It's got the spirit of the ""Dawsons Creek"" CD but with one added thing - heart. If you enjoyed the film you can live it over and over again with this nicely packaged soundtrack!"
2,"Good Concept, Bad Implementation","I bought this book because it was the only one that actually seemed to tell me where to start. I have LOTS of experience in programming with procedural languages but was bewildered by an environment where snippets of code are attached to one control but need to reference some other control. I found this book helpful because it began at the very beginning and worked through the basic concepts quickly. HOWEVER, I don't know that I can recommend the book. It is for the absolute beginner in sense that it goes into very little depth but someone with little programming experience probably will not get much out of it. Compounding the problem is the fact that there are a lot of errors. With my experience, I could tell when something was an error but it could be confusing to a newbie. This book has value for the experienced procedural programmer with little event-driven experience but even for that audience it could have been much better."
1,Beginner my A*#,This is a very difficult book to understand. It says it's for the absolute beginner! I've already had a Visual Basic class and could not understand this book. He gives code examples but never tells you how to implement it. You have to look at the picture and try to figure out that you need to add a text box or a label to the form before you have a place to write the code he shows you. It is very poorly written with no instruction or definitions of code lingo. I wish I could get my money back!
1,Tiny and Thin,"Very small and not that thick, way over priced for something this terrible. Ended up going to the store and getting something worth it."
5,quick and easy,"This networking kit is easy to setup, and easy to run. Themanual and the software walk you through every little step of theway. After you setup the network you can share files, Internet connections, and external devices (printers, scanners, ect...). The network PCMCIA card for the notebook gives you the freedom to move around with your computer without tripping up on wires. I would suggest this system to anyone that has more then one computer in there home."
5,Knees feels better after a few months on this,"I have a junk knee, lots of arthritis and many ACL reconstructions. I started taking this in hopes of getting some relief and I feel like since I have been taking it my knee can tolerate a little more before it gets sore and I have a little less aches and pains."
1,information incorrect about the product,"3 capsule content: glucosamine 1.1g condrointin 1.2g with MSM 100mg and not each capsule... I am really disappointed, I hope to put the right information"
3,Okay Product,I have been taking this product for the past 3 weeks. I really don't notice any difference in my joint pain. I am 57 years of age and my mother always told me getting older there is aches and pains. I thought this would help and so far no difference. I like this company but will not be purchasing this product again.
2,What is the serving size?,"The fact that this product does not tell the consumers what the serving size is, bothers me. 180 capsules, awesome. However, to get the 1.2 g of Glucosomine, 1.1 g of Chondroitin, etc... do I need to take 1 cap, 2 caps, 3 or 4 caps? This greatly determines if it is worth the $22. Kirkland brand is 2 tabs/serving and at a higher concentration (withouth the MSM though). I am guessing the dose here is 3 capsules, which is not nearly the value of Kirkland. Again though, I have no idea because NOW does not bother to list this."
1,Glucosamine...,"I purchased this sulfate after trying HCI. Now Foods is sulfate. Kirkland is HCI. I tried both products when I had discomfort in my one knee without any results. Infact after I stopped consuming Glucosamine, few months later my knee was back in shape. I do not take any supplements for my knee at all and instead I have added more fruits, vegetables and nuts to my diet which have been very helpful to my health. At least that is what my blood test show year after year as well as my knees and joints tell me after every workout from mountain biking to surfing to weight lifting."
2,Packing needs improvement.,"I have used (Now) supplements before and have enjoyed the quality and price,however, when this product arrived with the top open. In that the supplement is a capsule and not a tablet I decided not to take them."
1,Too powerful--broke my tapes,"I like the idea of having a rewinder, but this one is too powerful. It doesn't slow down near the end of the tape and it broke 2-3 tapes so I have quit using it altogether. It was also tricky to operate. Wish someone would make a good rewinder that wouldn't ruin tapes. It would save wear & tear on your VCR. Anyone know of one??"
2,Built to break.,"Every single tape rewinder I've bought has died prematurely. This Kinyo worked fine for about a year, which is why it got 2 stars. But it's the last one I'm ever buying. From now on we'll use old VCR machines to do our rewinding!"
4,Good and necesary for your cassettes,"The kinyo Cassette rewinder is a necessary tool for your cassettes but mostly it will help your cassette to continue to have a long life for your viewing pleasure.So sorry to borrow a line from a movie but "" VHS RULE and dvd and blu-ray suck """
1,Garbage!,"This rewinder is a garbage. I did not buy from Amazon, but I would like to share my experience to others. I should have read the reviews before the purchase. This thing does not have a counter. The lid is hard to close. It does not stop and pop open when tape is fully rewinded. The instruction is poor. And it is too costly to return to where I bought it. I used a long rubber band to replace the broken drive belt in my old rewinder. It works!"
2,most are broken,"I purchased 4 and out of the 4,I had to return 3 because they didn't work. I received 3 replacements and had to return 2. They aren't very well made and you can tell even when they do work. When you close the tape part to make it rewind, it will become loose very easily, so you have to hold your hand on the machine for it to start. I wouldn't suggest buying one."
1,Tape destroyer,"I bought this on the basis of the top review here, and am sorry I did. The unit pulls so hard it has torn several tapes right off the spools, and seldom opens by itself once the tape is rewound -- the motor keeps hauling away at a fully rewound tape. It often balks at loading cassettes and balks at releasing them; numerous time I've had to pry my tapes out of it with a screwdriver. Not once has the cleaning button stayed down, so this feature is as good as absent. I finally put the infernal thing in the garbage, where it belongs."
1,Cassette rewinder-Tape Cl;eaner,"I am only marginally satisfied with this produce. It does the basic job, but the instructions are lacking in how to replace the ""cleaner pads"" or how to obtain replacement pads when the two provided are used up. Further, the Amazon description of the product states it has a tape counter - if there is one I can't find it. I wrote to Amazon about the description, and you said contact the manufacturer. I did - no response. Pete Salyards"
3,"OK, but...","Flimsy overall unit. Works all right but has jammed a few times. In the future, I'd look for something sturdier."
1,It's not worth the money,"This is an awful product. It doesn't rewind easily... wants to fast forward instead. In addition, it ruined two tapes during a rewind attempt. Would like to return it."
1,Defective,"I read the instructions. Inserted a tape. It made a horrible noise.No matter what button I pushed, nothing worked, just more noise. Then the noise stopped, and it won't do anything. I can't return it because of the""policy"". I neglected to save the box. What a waste of money."
1,Kinyo Cassette Rewinder,"I would never purchase this rewinder again. It is very poorly designed and does not function well. There is only one button for both rewinding and fast forwarding. It is difficult to operate. And when it rewinds it does not stop well, and can tear the tape right off the reel."
1,They're all broken.,I purchased this product for my dad for Christmas and the first one they sent me was broken. I got a replacement and the second didn't wok either. Don't buy this product.
2,rewinder,the rewinder is missing the 3 digit counter that was supposed to be on it and it says that it has a quiet ejection which I think is just the opposite. It is quite jarring when it pops open.
1,VHS tape rewinder,I purchased two Kinyo tape rewinders..brand new...and from the time I first started using them until now...they both bombed out. They wind just fine but neither one pops the lid open and the tape stays in the winder until you manually pop the lid. By then the tape is very very hot. If you have 20 some bucks to blow..I say buy them. But I am sure 6 months down the road I am going to be paying the trash man to haul them away.
1,Dead as a door Nail,Bought 2 of them 4 months ago from this site. Both are dead as door nails.First would not stay closed then make ugly noise then nothing. Help? Not a bit of it from the manufacturer.
5,These things are worth every cent.,"I was looking for a nice set of torx bits for work. These things really perform. They are actually machined out of a larger piece of metal... not cast like the Chinese crap that's out there. I beat the crap out of these things every day and they have really held up. The T25 gets used the most and despite misusing it and stripping out some screws (my fault not the bits), it hasn't seemed to been affected. I wish they sold them in longer lengths to add to my collection."
4,another thing to add to your collection,"If you're a fan of NBC, you already know the story forward and backward. This is just another interesting way to look at the story. The drawings are very nice. I'm not sure if the dialogs match those in the original movie though. Anyway, I'd recommemd adding this to your NBC collection (and play the soundtrack while reading it if you have one)."
3,Pretty good i guess.,said it was used if i remember correctly. when it got here the cover was not attached to the binding... lucky i know how to fix things... my guy loved it as a gift.
4,Still waiting for a NBC2...,"This is the Manga version of Tim Burton's masterpiece; A Nightmare Before Christmas. It comes complete with Japanese text SFX and English translation and is even published right-to-left! (which is authentic Manga style). I must say I prefer this way to left-to-right publications. The only downside to this Manga was it was more focused on Sally and her, not Jack. I'm a fan of Jack and reading it all about her disappointed me. But I still bought it to see the Pumpkin Kings reign live on."
3,Only another piece for a NBC collection...,"It's a very different point of view in this book(manga),all the dark concept of every character had been changed for a very soft and innocent look,like children cartoons. It is the movie in the book but with another concept way more different than the one brought by Tim Burton."
5,never read but want 2,"Though i am a HUGE fan of Nightmare Before Christmas, And I dont have it, I hAVE TO SAY IT SOUNDS TIGHT!!!! :)!tHE MOVIE IS JUST BREATHTAKING BUT IN MANGA FORM MUST BE ADVENTROUS THROUGH MY OWN EYES. IF YOUR A JUST AS BIG FAN AS ME, YOU BETTER READ IT! iT SOUNDS EXCITING."
5,Pro Macro lens,"I have been into photography for many many year, and have always had a spot for macro pictures. I have used other macro lenses before, but nothing compares to this. It is a speciallity lens, and it can be used for nothing else than macro, but WOW it does it well.It can produce images from 1:1 to 1:5 ! Yes, 5 times real life, that is CLOSE UP MACRO. It does not have any focus system, so all focus is manual, and can only be done by moving the lens and camera back and forth. I HIGHLY recomend some kind of focus rail system and tripod. ESSENTIAL for using this lens. It can be hand held with success, but it requires a steady hand. It extends to almost 25 cm when shooting at 5x and it is a bit heavy, so get a sturdy tripod.DOF is very easy to control, and image quality is very high. Highly recomended to the serious macro photographer. Also, ring flash is a MUST HAVE item with this. Optionally one or two external flashes for better light control."
5,Yippy Skippy,"Long-term good health, give a few weeks to get you back on track. What's the line from the Devo song? ""Vigor, vim, vitality, and punch!"""
5,LUV Madonna,"I only wish Madonna had more of her material out on Blu-ray.This concert isn't my favorite, but I highly recommend viewing it on Blu-ray. She puts on one hell of a performance"
2,Not pleased with Blu,"I purchased this product on d dvd before, great concert as usual, actually i liked it so much that decided to buy on Blu-ray, no diference, no tru-hd audio, extras, anything, i strongly recomend the dvd version, second of all, when i placed the order it said CD/BD combo, well, it does not bring a cd as with the dvd. I honestly don't know what's wrong with warner & madonna and digital video, i hope at some point they understand the needs of us who like madonna & technology, and want the best version available, to end, i am from Costa Rica (central America)and in here & Mexico we have blu-rays of our own artists much better designed, better sound and picture quality, how can this happen? It's Madonna. Warner Bros!!!"
1,Doesn't play on PC,"This is for the BD version.This BD played on my PS3. I was not very impressed.However, I give this 1 star because it will not play on my legally purchased PC with a legally purchased OS, legally purchased BD ROM drive and legally purchased Blu-Ray player.I'm sure this has to do with copy protection.So I guess the manufacturer is willing to annoy PAYING customers in their attempt to stop pirates?Thanks Warner Bros, next time I will think twice before purchasing any of your garbage."
1,DOESN'T PLAY,"I am so stupid in that I got this and put this away for months! Just pulled it out and tried to play it but computer keeps making weird sounds and then spits it back out! I got a DVD that doesn't play! And the return timeframe is way past! Rip Off! ... I dunno, maybe I was just unlucky but it still sucks."
3,Wheres the CD+Blu-ray format,"I rated three stars because I like the Blue-ray content. If the package would've included the CD, I'd rated it a 4-star.Format: CD+Blu-ray, Surround Sound / I don't think so!What a bummer today when I recieved my package. What a big surprise and dissapointment when I open the case ans there was only ONE disc. No audio disc? The Amazon.com says that the format is Blu-ra/CD. Very bad Amazon.com."
3,Blu-ray no so HD,"Don't get me wrong, I love Madonna! But the image quality of this blu-ray is sub-par and extremely disappointing."
5,Spectacular,"I had the opportunity to attend to this concert in So Paulo, Brazil, and whoa... Madonna is the eternal queen, no one does it like she does. It's not just about the music, it's about the ""Madonna attitude"". This footage is excellent, not too edited like her previous Confessions Tour, which makes you get the live vibe from it. If you like Madonna or simply a good show, do not leave this Sticky & Sweet tour blu-ray out of your collection."
4,"Good concert, average video quality","Madonna is very well known for giving amazing shows with non stop fun, and this is not the exception. The only bad thing that I didn't like very much is the quality of the video of the concert, while the Bonus: Behind the Scenes, has a cristal-clear image, the concert doesn't have it, it looks a bit blurry in contrast to the bonus features. I need to try this in another TV set, but I doubt that that is the problem considering that the extra feature looks well.After some time, the video is not bad, the problem is that it has a blurred effect to make look better everything on the screen."
5,I recommend,"Beautiful, wonderful, loved the show. Recomento everyone. Very good price and on-time delivery. I recommend the product and the seller."
5,AMAZING!!!,"I am ecstatic with this concert DVD!!! It is incredible the physique on this women!! She still amazes me till this day.It motivates me to work out and run on my treadmill.The energy that she has, and her dancers gets me so fully PUMPED UP and makes me want to move!I play it constantly and I am still not tired of it.The creativity of the costumes, different themes and dancing/singing, colours, videos is so inspiring and just gets me up off my butt and running/weight training every time!!!SO ENERGIZING!Very thrilled with this product and has made back the money I spent over and over again!So happy I ordered it!!THRILLED WITH THIS PURCHASE to say the least.K"
4,One of Her Better Efforts,"Madonna has always been innovative in her live shows. That she has released several over the years is a testament to her changing style. Always well done, always slightly controversial always fun. The Sticky and Sweet Tour was no exception.Recorded in Argentina the video presents the complete concert with lots of cutaways to fan reactions. The song selection for this show relies a little more heavily than I'd have hoped on her newer material. The remixes of some of the older material provide unique interpretations of songs like Into the Groove and Borderline while the audience sing along on Like a Virgin was kind of unexpected.The BluRay release is a little short on extras providing only some backstage material. This is a fun package that is well worth owning for fans of the singer or her music."
4,"Good video, poor editing, no CD","The video and audio qualities of this Blu-ray are fantastic. I was disappointed that the Blu-ray did not include the audio CD here in the U.S. I attended the show in Houston with fairly good seats, but I was really looking forward to the video so I could see the little details that I missed in the live show. I am a little disappointed in the editing of the video as the shots are really edited quick and tight. It doesn't give the viewer a chance to take in much before the next edit. That's why I give it a 4 out of 5 stars."
5,Exactly as expected,"Not much to say, it feels solid, it screws in easily and securely, and does not affect image quality enough for me to notice. With my 70-200 lens I can fill the screen with an image bigger than the object...not exactly ""macro"" but it's enough for me!"
2,Lukewarm Young Adult Historic Romance.,"If you like Little House on the Prairie or Dr. Quinn: Medicine Woman, by all means, go ahead and read this book. You could certainly do worse. Basically, this is Almanzo and Laura Ingalls Wilder saving the day as theater actors headed for San Francisco meets All My Children. Nice, safe, formulaic read with a predictable ending. All the fun of eating a twinkie with an entertainment value that lasts less time to forget you ever consumed it at all. Jeanette Oke writes better books about the same era than this."
1,BIG DISAPPOINTMENT FOR A FAMILY OF COVILLE FANS,"Bruce Coville has always been a big favorite in our house for family reading. We have loved the Alien series, the Magic Shop books, and all the others. But my one word summary for this book is YUCK! I've never read a harlequin romance, but I have a feeling that this book is just like one of them. It's not that I don't care for historical fiction; we just finished The Ballad of Lucy Whipple by Karen Cushman, and that was fantastic. Compared to Lucy Whipple, Fortune Plunkett is an empty-headed feather-brain. Sorry, Mr. Coville, but this book just didn't seem to meet your usual high standards."
4,"""Fortune's Journey""","""Fortune's Journey"" is about a girl, Fortune, trying to carry out her father's last wish of travelling with the acting troupe to California. Fortune, an orphan except for her 'adopted' family, the acting troupe, stuggles to cross the United States to California. She moves from one town to the next putting on some of Shakespeare's plays to earn money for the journey. Along the way she meets Jamie, who becomes her friend, confident, and significant other. The acting troupe experiences mob fights, the loss of play props due to fire, gold fever, and the discovery of hidden secrets. The book ends happily ever after."
4,This was a good book for middle schoolers.,"This was a good book with action, romance, and mystery. During the whole book you wonder if fortune will end up with jamie or aaron and who jamie really is. You get real into the characters and who they are. this was a pretty good book by a person I never thought I would read. It isn't Coville and/so it is a good book"
4,Still going strong 5 years later,"I've now been using this laptop for approx 3 to 5 hours a day for 5 years and it still runs ten times faster than my much more recent desktop at work.I am keeping my eyes open for a new laptop because I know the technology and software will make this one completely obsolete soon.I use it for gaming and internet use mostly. It is very good for video playback. My only reason for not giving it five stars is because it has a faulty ac power connection that sometimes comes loose, and I wish the audio was better.It doesn't have half the features of the current laptop lineup but for the past five years it has been a powerhouse."
1,Average Product but SHOCKINGLY poor support!,"The keyboard is a bit flimsy and so is the display. Tech support is less than average with their knowledge level but the customer support is simply the most unprofessional I have ever come across! I don't think it is isolated since out of more than 15 people (including supervisors and case managers) I spoke with, about 5 at best, knew how to provide basic customer service!!So, if you have to send anything in for service, unless it is very straight-forward, add several hours of your wasted time while calculating the total cost of the product."
5,Übung macht den Meister,"i found this course to be very helpful, thorough, and entertaining. it is an excellent learning tool for the price bracket. the key is listening to each tape at least 10-12 times. it will keep you busy for a while. very practical phrases, and up to date vocabulary."
4,"Excellent Supplement, entertaining & varied","""All-Audio German"" is very good at what it does. I found it to be an excellent suplement to my other German book/tape course. (I think it would be difficult to learn grammer with out a text book). The lessons are entertaining and varied, and a great way to make use of driving time. Be advised that the lessons progress at a rapid pace. It will help to have a pause and rewind button to enable reviewing vocabulary, provide extra time to answer quiz questions, and reviewing those occasional fast spoken German lines."
1,Fraud Auditing and Forensic Accounting,"This was not what one would expect from the title. There were no methodologies provided to research and detect fraud and very little in terms of accounting controls was addressed. The book is a collection of anecdotes and cases with very little practical information that transcends the most basic concepts. The book spends too much time discussing behavioral aspects of fraud as opposed to legitimate financial investigation. Overall, a huge disappointment."
4,Fraud Auditing and Forensic Accounting,"In my opinion, this book describe in detail the types fraud that can be perpetrated and how it is perpetrated. It also shows us how to detect the red flags in different types of frauds. Overall, it does fulfill my needs in buying the book in terms of how to look for the red flags and how I should focus my risk areas in terms of frauds auditing."
1,Fraud in Advertising,The Kindle version is only the 5th chapter of the text. Ironic that Amazon would pull this trick on a book on fraud.
2,colors inaccurate,"more greenish than silver. did not work in my room but not bad as entryway rug, matches our paint job in the hallway, fortunately."
3,FATHER COP,"Although based on Arthur Hailey's bestseller, DETECTIVE doesn't live up to its pedigree.The story gets muddled at times; a former priest turned detective is assigned to track down a serial killer who kills elderly couples in some sort of religious frenzy. His partner and lover is the Councilman's daughter, and the cop himself is estranged from his wife and son. Their personal crises intermingle with the murder plot, and although you will maintain your interest, it's a little long in the tooth with only average performances.Tom Berenger as the detective gives a relatively dispassionate performance; Annabeth Gish phones in her partner performance' Cybill Shepherd as the wife gives the most effective performance but she's not in the movie much. Charles Durning and Sean O'Bryan round out the cast. This could have been much better with a shorter script and more impassioned performances from its leads."
1,Corporate Rubbish,This book isn't worth a cent. It's full of lies and major flaws.Almost all scientists agree that global warming is a real danger to mankind. Insteed read something like Boiling Point or Complete Idiot's Guide to Global Warming.
4,"Funny, witty and clever","How can you help but not feel for poor Grace Alter, with parents like hers? Yet here's for the human spirit. She manages a way to take refuge in her own quirky, bright, precocious little mind and make the best of a world which -- well -- is clearly not of her making. This story has all the craziness and stupidity of today's politics and still comes up laughing, and boy do we need that!"
4,Impressive Video Camera,"The Hitachi VM7500LA VHS Camcorder is extremely impressive. It's easy to use, not very expensive, has lots of cool features & gives a clear, crisp picture. My only complaint is that the battery doesn't last very long, so you have to plug it into the wall. Overall though, I love it!!"
2,Not high quality,"These sheets look nice, however they are not soft, they don't fit my queen sized Select Comfort bed well and one corner seam (after the second washing) has already torn out. I would avoid this brand in the future."
2,Broken on the second use!,"I bought these dog booties because my dog has longish fur on his paws and when he plays in the snow he accumulates snowballs between his toes which hurt him. He got the booties for Christmas, and it just happened to snow that night. The next day we tried the boots and even though they were the right size and I had tightened the straps as far as they would go, they kept sliding off his feet as he played in the snow. The next day, the plastic feeder for the strap broke as I tightened it, rendering one of the boots useless. This product is not designed well for its purpose and has flimsy parts."
3,does not work with some wiper blades,The part that attaches to the blades is too narrow for some of the blades on the market and will turn inside the attachment point of the blade and not hold properly. May want to stick with anco or recommended blades to fit
2,Urgh,"I had to purchase this 'textbook' not for reading pleasure but for a course in college. Though it went in depth on how to cooperatively have a deliberative community and gave plenty of examples of such. I found this book to be lacking, perhaps it was the fact that most of the definitions of terms and theories were hidden in the text and through the long diatribes called examples, rather than being highlighted or bold/underlined for a student to successfully find what they maybe studying."
1,Wouldn't buy again,"At first I thought these were great... made in Japan, 2650 capacity. After actually using them, I had to conclude that there is something very wrong with these. Some of the batteries don't seem to charge or hold charges properly. After putting them in a Canon flash unit, after a few days of very light use, the flash stopped working because it wasn't getting enough power. I had this happen at least twice with these but not with other brands. I would not buy these again."
1,These Made in Japan batches of 2650 mAh batteries are really bad,My 4 sets of Duracell developed high self-discharge and permanent loss of capacity. My testing shows these degrade significantly before you reach nowhere near the ~500 cycles that is typically claimed for NiMH batteries.DO NOT BUY!
1,Defective Batteries can ruin your camera,"Thought I was getting a good deal on these. Noticed erratic performance, so I replaced my charger. Turned out some of these batteries would only hold a charge for a few hours. I threw out the ""bad apples"", thinking that only a few were defective. (I had purchased several packages of these.) Big mistake. I should have returned them all.Over the next few months had more failures, even with the batteries that had previously tested OK. Some of these failures took place at very bad times, costing lost work and time. Eventually, they damaged an expensive camera, which had to be repaired at the factory.I have since replaced all of them with Sony brand batteries, which seem to be OK."
5,Battery technology gets better,"These batteries are far superior to NiCads. They hold a charge very well, and can be charged and discharged without having to worry about ""charge memory"" limitations that kill NiCads quickly. They do have a very slightly larger inherent voltage at full charge, and some Ni Cad chargers may not be able to fully charge them, but they are really worth a try for the far superior life and charge retention they have."
1,Either duplicate or bad batch,As noted by few reviewers these cells hold charge for 5 days max. They lose the charge within 20 shots with my powershot 540. The No brand 1800 on the other hand lets me take close to 100 shots easily. Would not buy Duracell again.
2,The package received was broken,Looks liked used one when I received them. The package received was broken. Amazon should really check their supply.
3,Working Good when they have charge. They lose their charge so fast.,"I bought (4 packs * 8 batteries/pack = )32 batteries in November.I opened two packs. So far very disappointed. I should have tested them earlier so at least I can return them in time.I have all different brands of NIMH batteries like Energizer, Panasonic, Sanyo, Rayovac, Powerizer and some made-in-japan cells.I can's say all of them are good. But at least they hold charge for quite a while.These cells are made in Japan and they are ""DURACELL""with 2650mAh rating. I know they are working great before they are drained. But they lose charge much much faster (even they they are not used) than all of NIMH batteries that I have. I don't know whether I got the bad batch. I just hope that the other two packs that I haven't opened yet will be good.PS. I used several kinds of chargers (one-hour, overnight and... from Energizer, HP and Lacrosse). Maybe I can try 'Refresh function' using my Lacrosse chrager."
3,They're ok but ....,"They are ok but not as good as the Energizer 2500mAH NiMH rechargeable batteries. The battery package says they are 2650mAH so you would assume they have a longer life on each charge but the energizer with the lower mAH rating lasts I'd say at least 10% to 20% longer. Also noticed if you charge the battery up and let it sit without using it, it drains in around 3 days. It actually lasts longer if you put it in a device. I can charge the energizer batteries and let them sit and there is no noticeable drain for around 4 to 5 days.Don't get me wrong, these are still dang good rechargeable batteries. Better than most but for advertising better specifications then the Energizer 2500mAH batteries, I just assumed they were actually better."
2,Don't Buy,I always think Duracell is good but not in this case. Batteries can't hold charge after 3 or 4 days
1,Read this before you order!,"The title says $27.15 for pack of 2, 8-count packages, you would think there are 16 total. Wrong, it's only 8 batteries for $27.15. So you what you get are $3.4 per piece batteries. .....Sorry but these are the most expensive batteries I ever bought.I would rather buy some Energizer batteries from local Sam's club or Walmart.But curiously some people claimed that they got 16 total by $27.15. Customer service insists that you only get 8 instead.Now I am confused!"
5,"16 Batteries, 2650 MaH, Great Deal","I received two packs, each with 8 batteries, for a total of 16 batteries. A great deal, espcially since the batteries had a higher capacity than listed: 2650 MaH."
4,Essential,"This book serves as a reminder to those of us who teach internationally of the differences in which we will encounter in a new environment. There are tips of how to reduce the culture shock and some keys to keeping yourself, your colleagues, students and parents in good moods and full of confidence in your ability.There is some information about the major types of curriculum since you may be switching (or some of your students may have recently switched) and there will need to be some acculturation. This volume should be reviewed once or twice a year for teachers at international schools to remind them of some helpful information in making their teaching careers easier. The book's length makes this goal easily attainable."
3,NOT MUCH TO SEE BUT GOOD,"I bought this because of the Winchester House. There's not much in the way of books on the subject and I'll never get to California so this DVD is as close as I'll get to the actual house. I wish it had more footage of the interior though. Lots of talk about the Winchester rifle and Sarah but I hoped to see more of the house. I've always love the America's Castle series on A&E; but this one didn't show as much as others have.Scotty's Castle is interesting and again, it talks a lot about the people in it but they show more interior footage than they did for Winchester House. A bit disappointing but with so little information out there on this subject, I'll keep it. I bought it at a great price so I can live with the short 50 minutes this DVD shows me."
5,Truly Independent band playing Native American Progressive Metal,This is an amazingly original album put together by an independent band from the woods of Northern Maine. Blending progressive metal with Native American tribal rhythms and chanting it's unlike anything else out there.
5,Love the Close-up,"This lens works nicely for close-up images. Its easy to use and is very clear. It is just that little extra you need for some shots. This is one lens I carry when out looking at an area I haven't walked before, you never know when you might want to shot something close-up and this lens makes it easy and fast. My everyday lens is a 18-200 so it gives a great range when out on a walkabout."
3,Tutto Verdi,"Not quite what I thought it was. Instead, a sample from each of Verdi's operas by the Parma company. Performance is OK. HP"
4,A Quality Sampler,"Excellent casting, audio, and video. A pleasant evening's entertainment and a fine way to discover operas which merit further exploration."
5,"Actually, I Loved It","I felt sorry for the little girl who was afraid that if she baked cookies for her school party they would be yukky. I love to bake with my mom. We like to bake chocolate chip cookies and things for snacktime at kindergarten, but we also made the cookies like the little girl did in the book. They really were the best cookies! I like it when my mom reads with me and bakes with me. And the book had a necklace like a cookie cutter in it! I think I can make cookies as good as the girl in Queen of Hearts. Other girls will like this book too, but probably not boys."
1,Guyver Days of Future Past,"When I first watched this remake of the guyver, one word came to mind: Lame. It's not near as action packed as the original dubbed version. The only good thing in my opinion was the lengthened fighting scenes and extra story line, but there was almost too much talking. I think they should finish making the old one and forget about this one. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, expecially if your a big fan of the old one."
1,Do not buy this...,"I bought this thinking that it would be a cool retelling of the story with improved artwork.It's not,it's almost exactly the same, except it's worse! yes with the advancement in television and film since the original series was made they managed to remake this series worse than it was before!buy the 12 episodes from the 90's much better."
2,DVD Damaged,"This was a used DVD rated as Good-Like New. However, there are six-one hour episodes and one entire episode was damaged to the point it could not be seen."
3,Too scary for my kids,"This movie shows a very grim picture of the difficult times faced by the Ingalls family. While the cinematography was often stunning, it was simply too scary for my 7 and 10 year olds, and my 5 year old had no interest in the movie at all. Having just completed reading the entire Little House series of books to my kids, I would say they were much better off using thier own imaginations to envision what Laura Ingalls shared with us about this period her life. As a child, I loved the Michael Landon TV series and my children love it as well. It doesn't bother me that the episodes rarely accurately follow the story lines of the books, as it is instead like a continuation of the stories, depicting things that could easily have happened to the family. I find these shows much more suitable for my young children than the Disney movie."
2,EXTREMELY SLOOOOWWWW - ONLY 2 DAUGHTERS,"Extremely slow with about 1/2 dialogue of the original Little House series with Michael Landon. No fooling. In my opinion it would of been more entertaining to have more dialogue instead of minutes of Laura walking with leaves and having the leaves on her bare feet, or Pa driving the wagon, or the undercarriage of the wagon - with no dialogue. Show is Ma and Pa Ingalls with Laura and Mary - no Carrie or Grace. BORING especially compared to the original series. You have been warned!"
5,Griffin Powell-Arcand Is too cute!,Loved this mini-series!Especially loved Griffin-Powell-Arcand as the Young Indian Boy.He is absolutely adorable!
4,"Cute movie, excellent value","I had never heard of this version of the story. It was well done and very cute. The price was a bargain, and made a super gift."
5,Different Style Disney's Little House on the Prairie,"I gave this a 5. I am a Little House Geek and have especially followed the Micheal Landon, NBC version of Little House shows. I can never get enough so I did watch this on tv when it aired a few years ago. I decided to purchase it with some Christmas money. I thought that this movie was much more thorough on the Ingall's trip out west. I found it to have a different style then Micheal Landon's version but it was still very good. The actors/actresses did an excellent job. Even my 8 year old son enjoyed this. It is very long so you probably will want to watch in two sittings or will need to set aside a lot of time to watch it in it's entirety."
5,Great movie!,This is a great movie! Really sticks closely to the original books. My nieces and nephew and the whole family love watching it!!!
5,"Finally, color in context","This book is more useful than any other swatchbook I've owned. The reader is guided, era by era, through a color history, with an interesting and often humorous analysis.An interesting read and useful too. I look forward to (hopefully) an updated edition with colors represeted in CMYK and RGB."
2,Why bother?,"There is very little of value in this book.The author has compiled color combinations that he has found in the world around us, and he has even gone so far as to give (approximate) CMYK values for the schemes. So far so good. The problem? He seems to find the same color combinations over and over again. Considering that there are sections here on Victorians, Art Deco, the Sixties, Earth tones, and Raves, one would certainly expect to find some drastically different color combinations. But flip back and forth between the ""Rave"" section and the ""Victorian"" section, and you will be surprised by how similar the schemes are. At least, I am.There are some minor assets to the book, but I would not recommend it. For those looking for swatches, I would recommend ""Color Harmony 2"" (ISBN 1564960668). Not only is it worlds better, it's also cheaper and smaller. And did I mention better?"
2,I can't recommend it,"I greatly admire the work of Leslie Cabarga -- particularly in the bookLOGO FONT & LETTERING BIBLE. Perhaps because of the aforementioned authorship, I let my guard down in purchasing DESIGNER'S GUIDE TO COLOR COMBINATIONS. The same tired layout is depicted hundreds of times in colors sampled from ""historic"" paintings. Though subject to personal opinion, I find the large majority of such colors are period dated or otherwise unsuitable for current graphic design projects. As with other books of this sort, the Live Color feature in Adobe Illustrator CS3 renders this reference work unnecessary."
5,Should be on every designer's bookshelf,"A terrific source of inspiration. Sure, you can just pick a nice color combination from this book and plug it into your own layouts, but if you take the time to read the entertaining text, you'll come away with a greater ability to discern the interesting color possibilities that we encounter everyday."
3,great but historical,"I have found this a great book,it ispire me but, it focus to much on old color combination.If there will be an upgrade version (like 500+ modern & future color combination ;-) I'm going to buy it as soon as possible.Anyway it's sure worth."
2,Do it yourself,"I was a bit disappointed in this book, it didn't really fulfill the idea i had of a book with colorschemes. I think everyone is better off looking up colorscheme sites like [...]"
5,Excellent book for the Color Combinationally Challenged,This book is an excellent resource for anyone in the field of Design. It not only offers a variety of color combinations to suit a particular style or time period but also includes the CMYK values to produce an exact duplication of the color(s) of your liking in the book (contingent upon monitor/printer callibration etc.).
2,Designer's Guide to Color Combinations,The historical information presented was interesting but I found the format for color display dull and unimaginative. It did not really give a sense of the interaction of the colors displayed.
2,Disappointing,"To tell you the truth, I wasn't all that impressed with this book. Personally, I found the ""sample layouts"" distracting, rather than helpful. The actually color swatches are very small, and I found the sample layouts overwhelming, as well inhibiting from a creative standpoint (rather than inspiring). Personally, I would have preferred just the swatch combinations (in a larger format), with perhaps one small sample layout -- although this may just be a matter of personal taste, and may work well for others. There are, however, a great deal of color combinations that are interesting and useful."
5,Eye opening view of Islam - God for Everyone!,"Guide book gives a brief uncluttered history of Islam and it's philosophy. Cards are great for spiritual exercise and discussion. A wonderful introduction for someone new to the concept of Islam (surrender) or a nice learning tool for someone seeking spiritual guidence. Learn about the REAL Jihad that everyone struggles with. This is the Islam of God, Compassion and Love, not 911."
5,difference between religion and culture,"This book explains Islam from a religious point of view, without cultural bias.The writer is clearly not a Muslim but has a great deal of respect for all religions."
3,"Largest and most up-to-date guide on South America (as of Dec 2005), but not well written","I am comparing this book to its primary competitor Lonely Planet South America.....Pros to Footprint:1.)Up to date; as of this writting Lonely planet had not updated their south america guide for about 2 years, footprint is very uptodate2.)Most content: at over 1700 pages this book has the most contentNegatives:1.) Not well written. I find this book very confusing, Lonely Planet is 4 or 5 times easier to use...Footprint is very vague on doing basic things like taking a bus from one town to next, and hard to plot a route to follow..2.)Paper quality....I know this is a minor thing, but Footprint used very cheap paper, and it is hard to turn pages...also almost no photographs in this book, so you better have good imagination ;)Personally, if I had to choose only one guide I would choose Lonely Planet, but this is perhaps a good supplement.....I haven't really looked at any of the Fodor books....."
4,Very Useful Info with Competitive Price,I packpacked to Argentina & Rio de Janiero with this guide book and it has everything that I need.
1,Green Jade Band,"The ring arrived on schedule, packaged in a nice gift box. It is just as I expected. Very nice!"
4,"Beautiful, but fragile!","The ring is beautiful, looks even better than the pictures on the site and me and my wife loved them. We got a matching pair. Hers is still on her finger after a couple of months, mine - sadly - shattered when I caught a key-ring tossed at me. Not even a big keyring, just a loop with a couple of keys... in other words, handle with extreme care. If you want to keep your ring in once piece, you will have to forever be mindful of not getting it struck with anything. Well worth the money though!"
3,It is so fragile.,"The ring lasted 2 days, it fell on the ground and split into two peices.If you buy this ring handle it with care."
1,not genuine jade,"This product is not genuine jade. The ring fell on the floor and broke in pieces. I have more jade jewerly that I tested throwing on the floor and nothing happend to them. I asked an oriental lady from my building that she has real jade jewerly, and she told me that the ring was not genuine jade it was a fake...."
3,breakable!,"When you're reading the the name of this product keep in mind 'Green Jade COLOR' the ring is actually made of glass.. That is why it is so breakable. I loved the color of it though and because i was very careful with it. The ring lasted a little over 8 months. Yet sadly it broke right in half. Ye what do you truely expect for the price, you're not buying high end jewelry."
1,"READ Reviews first on any book purchase,could save you $$$","PASS PASS PASS on this selection... I received this guide and was oustanded at the guide with everyother page being a one liner quote... Of the 52 pages half are these quotes nothing to do with music industry, then each ""Chapter page"" takes another page... Basically you get about 11 pages of nothing... Information that is readly available on almost any music website... However, on most music websites you get more detail...You should pass on this , whatever, the author wants to call it, its not a book, however, it is a guide how to loose your money on the purchase or a guide to one liners... I guess I should have read the review by Quentin Black before hand, funny thing is that Quentin Black is giving a thank you in book by author, strange..."
5,Must read for all women.,"This book, though written in 1980, still applies to every woman I know. We all suffer from The Cinderella Complex. Most women never change since they don't recognize the problem. Read this book so you will understand WHY you do the things you do. It really explains a great deal about why women are the way we are. We will never acheive true equality with men until we understand ourselves. I highly recommend this book and plan on buying many copies of it to give to friends and family. )O("
4,A nice book...,This book was good and when you put it downit always leaves you wanting more.mc growlis A very cute dog when you see him on the cover you wish you could pet him.His personality is really funny and cool.Violet always gets left out a little bit.To me the mayoris just kinda creepy even when he was nice the way theydecribed him was blaah.If your A dog lover like me you willlove mc growl.
2,"poor writing surface, save the money",My three year old often carries the note book around now only having to pretend to use it. The writing surface works poorly after only a few hours of play. Try magna doodle or paper instead.
2,Save your money,"I bought one of these for each of my 2 and 4 year old children. Within one day the individual pages were disconnected from the notebook and distributed all over my house, as they are only held in place by a spiral. The writing pen & surface of the paper are very poor quality. It's very difficult to erase the drawings, not sure if it's because of the pen or the paper. They also should've connected the pen to the notebook so it doesn't get lost."
2,Give your child some blank paper and save the money,"I bought these notebooks for my 3 and 5 year old children. They were very excited but the novelty quickly wore off. My 3 year old immediately grew bored with the toy when he realized he couldn't draw the pictures like Steve on the show. My 5 year old lasted a bit longer but after seeing the same episode 2 or 3 times she no longer wanted to draw the pictures. This toy sits in a box, unused."
1,Does anyone test these things before selling them,"The usual high quality of Fisher Price toys is totally absent in this awful contraption. The concept of a ""magic pad"" is an old one, and this dressed-up updated version doesn't work at all. My 2 1/2 year old LOVES BLUE and was almost in tears because he couldn't write in his notebook like Steve. Nickelodeon should never have liceneced Blue to used on this shoddy of a product and Fisher Price should fire whoever allowed this total waste to ever hit a store shelf. In fact, if I were Amazon, I would pull this from my website (hint hint)"
2,Can't write on surface... so what's the point??,"My son really wanted a handy-dandy notebook... save your money and get the mini- Magna-Doodle version. This notebook... you cannot write on the surface. It's just bright orange plastic and it sticks in blobs and streaks to the backing just by lying in the toy box. The stampers never stayed in their places on the back of the toy. I returned the one we bought and found the same toy only with a Magna-Doodle surface .... The stampers actually stay in the back, and it's a wonderful travel toy."
1,A toy not worth it,"This Handy Dandy Notebook is not so handy. It looks like an advanced version of etch a sketch and the little boards with the liftable plasitc piece that made the writing disappear. The writing mechanicism gets stuck quite often. It just fustrates my 21/2 year old, who usually insists on doing everything herself."
4,Disapointed,"My dd loves Blues Clues and I knew she would love this toy, but when she tried to clear the screen it didn't work well. The bar would just bend and only the lower corner would clear out. I ended up returning the toy."
5,It's a hit with everyone,"Not only does my 3 year old son spend time playing with it, all the kids who come to play with him also love it. It's going to be a great birthday gift this year."
3,Not Very Handy,I was disappointed in this product. My son is 3 years old and is very meticulous about his toys. Even he managed to get frustrated with the cleaning action of this toy. The bar that slides across gets stuck and bent and the only way to get it unstuck is to press down with a finger. This then leaves a mark so the screen never gets quite cleared off. I will be trying the MagnaDoodle version.
4,"My daughter loves this, but it didn't hold up so well","My 3 year old daughter is a HUGE ""Blues Clues"" fan...so when I saw this, I had to buy it for her. It worked for about a week, then she couldn't draw on it any longer and she kept losing the stamps. This toy is a great concept, but needs an all-over quality improve. She has given up on this now and is much more satisfied drawing on her Magna Doodle."
1,waste of money,This item looked really good at the store but once I got it home I was very disappointed. It doesn't really work at all. I thought it was similar to a magna doodle but it's not. And if you spill anything on it it is completely worthless.
5,After a year it's still going strong!!,"Very Durable and worth the money! My son has played and played with this toy and loves just as much today as he did when it was new. He even drags it around by the crayon and it has never torn up yet. As long as you keep the writing surface clean, with window cleaner, it works just fine. We clean our toys on a daily basis. (Perhaps that has been the problem with the others.!?!?)"
2,Disapointment,This notebook has great potential... but it didn't live up to it. Within a few days the top layer is sticking to the bottom making the toy useless. a big BIG frustration for my daughter.
2,A bust,"This was an utter waste of money. The writing surface is too small and the plastic film too unstable to draw on. The four ""stamps"" that pop out are too hard for a preschooler to get out on their own--and are then easily separated from the toy. Do yourselves a favor and buy a Magnadoodle!"
2,not what expected,"The clearing 'wand' wore out/didn't work after two days and continually hangs diagonally across the screen when you try to write on it. You can push it manually, but then the whole film you write on doesn't work really well either."
2,Handy Dandy Notebook,"I bought this for my 2 year old and 3 year old girls who love Blue's Clues. I am disappointed that within a few days of play, the drawing board doesn't work. There are ""bubbles"" on the drawing screen that don't allow drawing and the ""bubbles"" travel as they press on the screen with the pen. We also have the Magna Doodle-I'd recommend that toy instead. My girls do enjoy getting it out while they watch the show, but it no longer works for them to draw along with Steve."
1,No Lifespan,My daughter received this toy for Christmas last year. The plastic gets bubbles inside making it IMPOSSIBLE to write or draw anything. Was a waste of money.
1,Don't Bother,We bought this for my son at Christmas. The images faded off as soon as he scribbled on it. The stamps didn't work much better. We threw it away and replaced it with the Magna Doodle version.
2,Waste of money,"Very cheap. The writing board doesn't ""last"" very long, and the string that the ""crayon"" is on broke very easily by my 1 year old. Not recommended."
2,Not so hot for tots,"Although we realy love Blues Clues, this toy didn't work out so well. First, we lost the small stamps. They're supposed to rest in holes in the back, but my 2-year-old just didn't get the hang of it. Then we left it in the car for him to play with. It soon became unusable as the orange plastic window melted to the backing. I'd have to say that we were sorely disappointed."
2,Not a good deal!,"I bought this a couple of months ago and now its appropriate place should be in the trash bin. It was not easy to erase even when it was brand new. Now it sticks by itself after a while and smears the drawing. It takes me some efforts to erase, forget about my one-year-old son. The four cute characters are not flat enough to generate pictures as designed, either."
5,Laissez Les Bontemps Roulez!!!,"The Last Beaufort is beautifully written with great flair, humor and an artful use of New Orleans tout ensemble. Its rapid, suspenseful pace kept me turning pages from beginning to end. I loved it - a must read for anyone who enjoys Southern fiction!"
5,Cheers for Southern Decadence (celebrated most discreetly),"Hilarious. This is a wonderful, quick read wittily celebrating the collision of high southern manners with low southern morals, and a pure romance that redeems both. The lovers' families could only flourish in New Orleans, where their lethal indirectness in dealing with family indiscretions (which should not be discussed in polite society), will have you chuckling to yourself, if not laughing out loud."
4,Heavy Duty,"The best part of the product is the weight. It's heavy so it doesn't move much, or at all when pulling tape. The tape/core sits on the dispenser using gravity only. If you pull the tape out and UP, the tape/core will come out of place. Therefore, you must pull the tape horizontally to avoid that. If not for this issue, I would give it 5 stars."
1,Word processing baloney,"Introduction to Word Processing Word 2000 (Software Guides)Just another computer guide to waste money on. I have tried numerous books over the years, and have found most of them very good, but did not like this one."
3,Wide angle...barely,"The macro is just amazing you can get as close to your subject as you want and it doesn't have a problem, you just can't really zoom, the macro really only works at the lowest zoom of the camera, but this really isn't an issue for the most part since you are so close anyway. The wide angle has horrible distortion and there really isn't zooming available, it's all fuzzy beyond the lowest zoom on the camera.Only worthwhile if you want to spend all your time correcting the images with software.I also purchased this with the Opteka 2x telephoto lens with faired even worse."
2,Very thin and a strong plastic smell...,"I bought this mat for practicing Alexander Technique, not yoga. And I don't have a lot of experience with other yoga mats.But even my untrained eye can tell that this mat is surprisingly thin. I can't imagine it providing sufficient cushioning for yoga. Buy one of the deluxe thicker mats on Amazon instead. I'm supposed to use a firm mat in Alexander technique, but this is just too firm.More importantly, it has a very strong plastic smell. Sort of like what your clothes would smell like if you worked the production line at a Tupperware factory.I admit I'm very sensitive to these things, but the smell gives me a headache. That's not what I want in a yoga mat.It's nice that it comes with a mesh carrying bag. The bag is okay, but I'd worry that after a few months a strap would break.I won't know though, because I'm returning it tomorrow."
3,Nice bag but...,"Large, roomy, sturdy bag. Seemed perfect for me at first. Then I looked a bit more critically...It's the straps.The straps wrap around you in two pieces--the two overlapping pieces attach and are held across your body by the velcro on the straps. There is no real clasped belt or strap like I was used to. That was not quite secure enough for me.And what made it worse was the fact that the straps were too short. Since the velcro straps hold the backpack on, I would have liked maybe six inches more of strapping to feel really secure. I like to be really hugged when I am wearing my backpack.Not to mention that it is winter here in Chicago--those overlapping velcro pieces did not reach around me enough at all when I had my heavy coat on. Again, I needed at least six more inches on each side to feel comfortable.Other than the straps, I liked the bag. But because of the straps, I returned the bag."
3,"Nice bag, for skinny people.","I bought this daypack a few months ago for something to use when I went to the store or just when I needed to haul something around without carrying it. It has a nice selection of pockets and storage spaces and it is a Jansport product, so you know it will last forever. The only problem I had was it fits me weird. I am not a small man, a few more inches on the strap would go far. It always feels like it is digging into my neck and into my side as well. If you need something to carry books around in for college, please do not buy this pack. But if you are using it to haul light items or clothes, it works well."
5,He loved it!,We gave it to my husband for Father's Day 2009. He still uses it everyday. Very sturdy.
5,Really nice sling bag,"I really like this bag. I carry this thing around with me all of the time, it hold my laptop and books really well. Really light, but sturdy bag. Love it."
5,JanSport Antics Series Air Ciscon Sling Bag,"My son in high school is useing this bag for school. He likes the facts its one strap and all the convenient compartments it has for ID's and pens pencils,calculator and the large compartment for books!This is a bag you can take on to college! Great for his use!"
4,great backpack,I like this backpack--the sling stlye takes pressure off of the shoulders and is less stressful for my back. You can really put alot of stuff in the backpack and it does not hurt your back. I would buy this one again.
5,Wonderful Film -- Where is the DVD???,"A must-see. Peter Fonda and Warren Oates are great together again -- as they were in The Hired Hand and Race With the Devil -- in this offbeat film about rival fishing guides in Florida. Wish they had co-starred in more films.Also good are Harry Dean Stanton, Burgess Meredith, William Hickey, Elizabeth Ashley, and Margot Kidder.When the heck is a nice DVD transfer going to be available -- one that includes BOTH of the filmed endings? [WARNING! POSSIBLE SPOILER -- Well, I will only say that in one of the endings, there is a murder. I prefer the non-homicidal ending.] Get the director, Peter Fonda and others in the cast to do a commentary track!Maybe then we'll find out why the director filmed two endings -- and which did he prefer?"
5,A Faithful Movie Adaption.,"...Of McGuane's novels, ""92 in the Shade"" is perhaps my favorite. His movie adaption of this work is true to the quirky characters developed in his novel, and recreates the unique ambiance of the Florida Keys/Key West experience, and the sense of his character's fated participation in a script set in a cosmic ""play"" of Life that was also such a pleasurable part of the book.Cast selections were fitting...and this was one movie experience that left me with the same feeling as the prose, although the paths taken in the telling were quite different. I feel that McGuane's direction was essential to this success and the capturing of the subtle nuances of this story on film.An interesting independant film. McGuane's fans should find it true to the tale..."
2,"Fonda, Oates and Stanton: Hard to beat, but...",Amazon's copy features horrible audio and barely passable video. The $4.99 price-tag is definitely not a deal...but a terrific cast makes this '70s oddball worthwhile.
4,Good Study of a Neglected Period,"""Wavell's Command"" is a good, solid history of the Desert War mostly B.R., that is, Before Rommel. And Before Montgomery, for that matter. The war between England and Italy in North Africa is often glossed over in WWII histories. This book describes the time and does it in a form that's very pleasant to read. I wonder if Mr. Henninger's review is describing a different edition of this book? The book I read, which is the one in the illustration on this page, included quite a few maps and was a real pleasure to read. I loaned it to my mom, who also thought that it was top-notch. I'm currently waiting for the second volume to arrive and looking forward to it."
3,And I worked there!!,"I showed this movie to my business classes in high school. I would think they would give it a 2-3 star rating. The movie didn't really hold their interest, in spite of my helpful interjections. Circuit City was such a good company to work for when I started there. But it's difficult to believe how horribly management screwed things up. It was fun while it lasted. But, I wouldn't want to work in that kind of environment again, nor would I want to watch this movie again."
1,Don't rent this if you've ever had a real job before,this movie's description is false. it is just as bad as a safety or history video you have to watch to as a beginning employee. this movie is a waste of time and money for most of us.as for the circuit city employees that have emotion attached to the end of the company. it happens. move on. this stuff is ubiquitous.
5,Wacky but Great,"After you read this you will never look at the Sunday paper the same way again. Or the TV news or PBS either.Regarding PBS he describes ""bearing witness to the horrific evolution of Ken Burns from charming young girl to androgenic man-child to frightening bearded Civil War fanatic"".The only difficult thing here is separating fact from fiction speaking of which Hunter says he 'walks that precarious line in his mind himself'. He needs more therapy but in the meantime this is by far the funniest book I've read maybe ever.Darren Hunter is a tortured soul but we all benefit so hopefully he stops getting arrested!Tim"
1,Horrible,I heard about this book and bought it and it was a waste of money. It rambled on and was horrible.
5,Battery that Keeps on Going,"I was hesitant to buy this battery because the price was really too good to be true. To my surprise, it is a very good battery and last a long time before needing charged."
5,Incredible collection,"There are so many hit collections from the Statler Brothers and most of them just repeat the same 10 or 12 songs.I remember my parents having an 8-track from my youth that had what seemed like 20 songs from this great group. Although I couldn't remember the titles, I could recollect the music. I ordered this collection - hoping it would have all of those songs - and it did.While Monday Morning Secretary, All American Girl, and You Can't Go Home may not be their biggest or best-known hits, I sure am glad to have these and so many others that this collection provides.And the sound quality is amazing."
4,Maximum Boy Starring in Superhero...or Super Thief,"As a teacher, I am always looking for a way to hook those reluctant readers. The Zack Files and Maximum Boy series are just the ticket! I find that both boys and girls are engaged and throughly enjoy each and every book. They make great read alouds and the humour is at a perfect elementary school level. Our most recent read, Maximum Boy Starring in Superhero...or Super Thief? kept my students in suspense as they tried to figure out who was responsible for the thefts of 4 of the world's most valuable treasures. My 3rd grade class can really relate to Max's obnoxious older sister and Max himself and they very much empathized with Max as he tried to prove his innocence. I recommend the Maximum Boy series for any child that is looking for a funny and exciting adventure!"
3,Darker Pocky,"This is Pocky with a dark chocolate coating, which will suit people with a less than sweet tooth. Unless I get a sugar-high, I am pretty much unimpressed with things. These are not at all sweet, so for those who do not like sugar-overloads, Men's Chocolate Pocky should be a winner.They a convenient snack that does not leave you feeling too guilty about it all. Although not really my taste, I can say that they are not all that bad, either. If there are no strawberry ones, I can certainly destroy a box of these."
2,Poor construction spoils this book.,"My granddaughter loves this book, BUT it fell apart after about 6 months of use. The binding was very poor. All of the books in this series are wonderful with exception of the binding. I ended up buying it with library binding."
5,Engaging and Effective!,"My four year old LOVES this book. Even better, because she reads at the 2nd grade level, she read the whole thing herself; she was able to read and teach herself about maps. We mapped her room, our neighborhood, our walking route to the park. She is so excited about maps.We are looking forward to reading ""My Place in Space""."
2,Very disappointed!,Was very disappointed in this book. Felt the book should have more demonstrations & reading. My Grandson is in 1st Grade and he was bored with the book. Would not recommend purchasing this item.
5,GREAT SNORKEL & MASK,"I'm not the best swimmer in the world and with limited range of movement in my neck, I needed to get something to assist in my swim work-out. This mask and snorel set is the best thing I could have purchased from Amazon.com. It has given me a better work-out since I can do most of my strokes under water and don't have to worry about turning my head to breathe between strokes! The mask is wide enough to afford a great view so I can stay in my lane (since I use an indoor public pool). I like that the snorkel can be clipped onto the mask and its long enough to not take on water! I recommend this product. You will NOT be disappointed!"
3,"It isn't as bad as you all make it out to be, but it isn't the best either.","Although Jenny Lauren does annoyingly whine on and on about her health problems, I couldn't put this book down. I can't relate to her bulimia or anorexia, I can relate to her image issues. I agree with many customer reviews here that say ""get over it already"". But there is something to be taken away from her book.If you're thinking about it, I would definitely buy a used copy, just in case you don't like it, then you aren't out quite as much.I think that it takes a certain person to realize that it does take something to find yourself, even if you are a spoiled rich kid who gets all the awesome free clothes you could ever want. Or maybe, in spite of that. It's worth reading during a weekend, or ... maybe on a flight."
2,"Self-indulgent memoir, little redeeming value","I was bitterly disappointed in this book. I was expecting to find an engrossing memoir of Ralph Lauren's niece, to travel through her world of food obession and bulimia along with its attendant medical problems. Instead, the entire thing reads like a succession of whiny entries into a teenager's diary. Jenny travels from conventional medicine to acupuncture, astrology and new age herbalists in her efforts to find answers to her difficulties, with the reader being led to believe she funded all this with a bottomless checkbook. Coupled with an unsatisfactory resolution, this was a waste of my time."
1,"WHINY, PATHETIC AND WE'VE HEARD THIS BEFORE","We've heard Jenny Lauren's story so many times before - - it's a tired genre - - and just because she's ""of the"" Lauren empire, are we supposed to care more about what she's been through.Millions of us either have been through it ourselves or know people who have.Most importantly, Lauren doesn't address the real issues in her memoir - - that it is her family that continues to perpetuate ideals of female beauty in our society. And she should have taken a stand. This is her responsibility. And she didn't have the courage to address it. What a shame.As someone suffering from bullimia, I was expecting a lot more, and she has let many of us down.I wasn't motivated, moved or inspired - - and that's why I bought the book in the first place."
1,MISERABLY BOORISH,This book from start to finish is a horrible experience.Nothing but a whine and moan litany of complaints. I want a refund. yuk!
1,i regret ever laying eyes on this book,"this book puts you in the chair of one of jenny lauren's many therapists and assumes that you care about every ache and uncomfortable thought she experiences. I myself have had an eating disorder and I can relate to some of the difficulties she writes about, but even with my added sympathy to her problems, I wanted to throw this book out the window out of frustration. this book is nothing but 300+ pages of jenny lauren's complaints and accounts of how difficult her life is and how all of her problems are somehow the results of others' mistakes and not her own inability to grow up and take responsibility for her actions."
1,"A SAD STORY, BUT DEAL WITH THE REAL ISSUE","Yes, ""Homesick"" is a sad story but the author ignores perhaps the most important issue in what is supposed to be a memoir - - her last name is Lauren. As in Ralph Lauren. The family responsible for plastering billboards and filling pages of magazines with anorexic women. Couldn't she have devoted a paragraph to this issue? It left me curious as to how these images impacted her illness."
1,YAWN! YAWN!,"first of all i found jenny lauren completely irritating, immature and boring. she never stopped complaining which pissed me off. she was immature clinging to her parents all the time. get a life please. i kept hoping the book would get better but i was wrong. i stopped reading this book on page 164 if that tells you anything (there are 304 pages to the book). i could not take her crap anymore. i wanted to give this book ZERO stars but since 1 star was the lowest then that is what i gave."
5,Great movie!,"I would highly recommend this movie. It will keep you smiling from the beginning to the end. Also, has a surprising twist. Ian Somerhalder is absolutely fantastic (love his beautiful blue eyes) and Bijou Phillips is adorable (she reminds me of a young Goldie Hawn). Buy it today!"
5,Wake Rating,I rated this book 5/5 stars because if you need a good laugh this is a movie to watch. ;)
4,anything with Ian Somerhalder is worth seeing!,"decent romantic movie....as always Ian is superb in this...could have been written a bit better, but some great scenes in the movie."
2,Oh give me a break!,So over written and over acted along with all the cliches ever imaginable. This had all the makings of a good plot but then someone decided to throw in all the garbage. There we several false hopes that it was improving but again it goes back to being predictable and pathetic.
1,Disaster,"First of all let me say that I love Ian Somerhalder. Now let me say that I hated him for a short while after I saw this dreadful film. I love inventive stories, but this was trying to do way too much in a very short amount of time (plot wise). The premise is kind of neat and if it was done just the right way I think it could have worked, but it does not here. By the end of it my friend and I were watching it, jaws to the floor like ""What just happened?"" The characters are phony and the main character is so dense and unlovable. The dialog was strange and felt awkward most of the time. The story line was very ambitious, but highly implausible. I kept thinking ""Maybe if it were Tyler's sister or cousin even, but not his fiancé!"" He didn't even seem sad or lost at all and I could understand this if maybe they grew apart, but after finding out the way she died, not acceptable! Overall a HUGE disappointment."
2,Ian Somerhalder is better than this,Movie was long and drawn out. I was excited that Ian Somerhalder was the actor in it but the actual storyline itself sucked and I would not recommend this movie to purchase.
4,Bijou Phillips finally gets to look nice and be charming.,"There are some cute LA style expensive old fashioned girly clothes in this movie like from early 90s indy films like Nina Takes a Lover and Dream Lover. The false note is the inane pseudo dating dialogue between Ian Somerhalder and Bijou Phillips where both actors seem too cool handed and smart to say silly dating things - that is very strange. It's hard to trust Ian Somerhalder's character because his lines don't match his face despite the frat boy haircut. The thing I loved about Bijou Phillips character is her imaginary roommate and her lack of sentimentality in her interactions despite her character's ""personal tragedy."" I kept wondering if dead girl was closeted."
1,Introducing the poor-fit slipper,"I bought these slippers for my husband's birthday present and we were both very disappointed in them. The back of the shoe wouldn't stay on his feet--and he doesn't even have an arch in his foot! They looked nice, though, and inside it felt nice. He would have kept them had they stayed on his feet."
1,Mumbo jumbo,"I saw the author in the magazine Yoga for Everybody was inpressed by the article. The book had to be just as good? NO. I was looking for yoga to stretch and exercise and instead got more religion and philosophy. If your into the yoga as a religous or spiritual quest, this is a good book for you. If you want to learn how to become more toned and limber there are much better books out there. Yoga for men? No. Yoga for New Age Mr. Poneytail types. Yes."
3,Not so good for an elder cat,"I have a senior feline whose rear legs are compromised. She can't jump and pretty much wobbles around. While I've heard great things about this clumping litter, it just didn't work well for my Tasha. She pretty much just made a mess of it. My mother, on the other hand, has 2 young cats, and she swears by this litter."
2,"Compared to Dr. Elsey's, definitely not the best","I'd been using Dr. Elsey's for some time, but decided to give this one a chance when I was shopping at a store that didn't sell Dr. Elsey's. This litter is worse in almost every way. It's dustier than Dr. Elsey's, it doesn't control odor as well (in fact, the litter itself has an unpleasant smell), and it does not clump as well. My cat tries to bury his waste repeatedly because he doesn't like it either. It may be biodegradable and septic safe, but with the downsides I mentioned and the cost, I'm going back to Dr. Elsey's.I still gave it two stars because it clumps a little bit and is better than an average grocery store litter."
2,can't cover bad smell!!,"It smell nature by itself, but can't cover the pee and poo's smell at all. We even not finish this package. I only have one cat!"
3,Beware if Your Cat Loves to Kick Litter Around,"We purchased this litter for our two cats and have had a very different experience with the litter depending on the cat. I would say that the biggest downside to this litter is the very fine dust that it gives off. One of our cats LOVES to kick litter around the box excessively. He is a black cat and seemingly makes it his mission to come out of the box with all four legs (and some of his head) entirely COVERED in this fine litter dust. He then tracks litter dust paw prints all across the couch, and everywhere else he comes into contact with. Our other cat uses the litter normally and we haven't had any problems. Litter-flinging cat owners beware!"
5,Great litter!,"I've tried various litters, high and low end, and I like this the best so far. It clumps nicely, lasts a long time before you have to change it completely, and keeps your house smelling fresh. I'd definitely recommend this product."
2,My kitty was upset,"I have been usingPrecious Cat Kitten Attract Kitten Training Litterfor my kitten. World's Best Cat Litter, Clumping Formula was free with purchase at the pet store. It is something I've been intrigued with, so I got it to try out.I mixed some of it with her cat litter and she was not a happy cat. She jumped in, to use her litter box but instantly looked upset. She smelled it, tasted it, complained and then jumped out without ever using it.I switched back to Kitten Attract and she jumped in before I had a handful of it in the box and did her business. Obviously, she was holding it in and couldn't wait.I guess if I ever wanted to switch, I would have to use a separate litter box next to her regular litter box until she decides to try it, but I don't think I'll do that. She'd probably sicken herself eating it before she ever actually uses it."
1,"Hardly the ""World's Best Cat Litter""","I am not sure how this litter got the title of the ""World's Best Cat Litter"" I found NOTHING good about it. It is very high priced which does not really matter IF it was the best available litter. The very worst factor is the lack of odor control. I have two cats and have never had a problem with the smell of the litter box but this litter was terrible! The natural corn material might be the only good thing about this product. It has a money back guarantee so I will attempt to get my money back. (November, 2007--my money was refunded)"
2,Not Bad But Not World's Best,"I thought this cat litter was OK, but not great. I switched to it so my cats wouldn't be breathing in clay litter dust. Now they breathe in corn litter dust. Their little paws are completely covered in dust when they get out of the box. It cllumps very well and has good odor control for their urine but ZERO odor control for their feces. My whole apartment stinks after they go. (I also think it messes with their digestion when they clean themselves but that is just a theory - it seems like their poop smells a lot more since using World's Best). I tried Yesterday's News very reluctantly because I prefer clumping litter. I was shocked at how good it is. I hate that you have to change it every week but there is NO DUST, it doesn't track and it has fantastic odor control. I have two cats that share a litter box and they took to the Yesterday's News with no problem."
2,It clumps well but...,"I gave it two stars because this litter is one of the best clumping litters I've used thus far as it doesn't break into little pieces from multiple cat use. This product is made from corn and when you first pour it in, it smells like corn (a little weird but okay, it's natural.) It's been three weeks and I can't take the smell anymore. Not only does it not cover up the smell of the cat poo but also it's beginning to smell like rotten food. I wish they would come up with something that would clump this well that doesn't begin to smell over time. I won't buy this product again. In fact, I will be dumping both litter boxes tomorrow."
2,Mistake,"This litter is too expensive for what it's worth....it is more than messy, has a ""unique"" strange smell and I won't purchase it again."
2,Terrible smell,"This smells terrible, even when the box is clean. I agree that it tracks a bit less than regular litter, but it is somewhat dusty (I find white paw prints all over the house) (and I have a litter mat), and smells terrible. The smell bothers me the most, it is just overpowering. I clean the box everyday, but it is still bad. (I don't think it is my cat being smelly, as with the regular litter, we did not have this problem.) If I didn't live overseas, I would send back my remaining three bags to ask for a refund."
1,"Horrible odor control, too pricey, tracks all over !!!","I have four cats and we clean out the litter boxes at least once a day. I have used this litter for a few months and I am not happy with it. The odor control does not exist. I almost want to puke when I clean out the boxes. The price is not even worthy of it's performance, lumps break down and cause a permanent stench. And it tracks worse than Feline Pine. I am going back to Feline Pine because of it's superior odor control. I also had people comment on the bad odor since I changed. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!"
2,Really stinks,"I tried this for a few weeks and it really smells awful. While I was away for a few days, the cat sitter went out and got something else because this stunk so bad she couldn't stand tending to it. Not using it again. It was the first clumping litter I've tried and as far as I know, it clumped the way it is supposed to."
2,Waaaay too expensive!!!,"I started using this product a few years ago because I was allergic to all the other litters. It clumps ok, but is not very effective for controlling odor. But the manufacturers price is absolutely insane! If I'm paying a dollar a pound for something, it better at least be edible. I don't mind spending money on my cats, I only buy them premium food. But this corn litter has simply surpassed the amount I want to spend for litter. Luckily, I have found a cheaper alternative here on amazon that I'm not allergic to."
5,Best Cat Litter Especially For Automatic Litter Boxes,Hey the title says it all. It's kind of odd this litter is VERY lite. Yea lite as in doesn't weigh as much. This makes the little crappy motors in like my LitterMaid litter box work MUCH better. Oddly enough I have one that is over 5 years old and was starting to not work well. I changed litters from a clay base to this one and suddenly it works better than the newer models with the wire rakes. Don't get me wrong it still works great on those also but the older plastic one works better than it ever has.
1,My laundry room smells like vomit,"I have 2 cats, one adult and one kitten and I keep their litterbox in my laundry room. I purchased the wbcl about a week ago and it has absolutely no odor control! In fact, it has whatever the opposite of odor control is! After just a day my boyfriend and I started noticing a bad smell coming from our laundry room which over the next few days got progressively worse. First we were afraid one of the cats got sick. When finding nothing we moved our washer and dryer thinking maybe the kitten hid food that spoiled under one of them. Unfortunately after investigation the smell was undoubtedly from the litter I purchased and has made the entire room and my cats paws smell like vomit! It is seriously awful and unfortunately a waste of my money since I bought a huge bag of it. I highly would recommend AVOIDING this brand!"
2,Inferior Product,"I work at a pet store, and we've used this litter for our cats in the store's adoption program. I'm the one who cleans the litter boxes every day. This litter may be natural, flushable, and generally healthier for your cat, but the smell is horrendous. I put plenty of litter in each box, and the cats have never had diarrhea. However, the smell from the litter is that of strong vomit, and it's enough to bring me to the point of vomiting myself.If you live in a large house, or have your litter in an unoccupied basement, then this shouldn't be a major issue. If your living arrangements are rather small, then you should choose a different litter. I recommend Swheat Scoop and the Healthy Pet varieties in my high-end pet store for customers who want a natural product, and use Tidy Cats myself which I buy in Target because it has superior odor control."
3,Ambivalent,"There are some things I like about this litter: Flushability, strong clumping nature, and that it's corn based rather than a clay or some esoteric synthetic product.That said, there is one major downside: laughable odor control. Within a week of starting on this brand I had to buy another variety with strong odor control capability to mix with it just to keep the room where the cat box resides in any kind of bearable condition. If you have a cat with particularly benign droppings this might not be an issue. On the other hand if you have two or more I'd stay far, far away.An inquiring mind might consider purchasing aquarium zeolite (absorbs ammonia) or activated carbon on the side to mix in to improve the product. If I get around to such an experiment I'll update the review accordingly."
1,My cat decided the world's worst,"I picked this up when it was on sale at Target. Bag did not look like the yellow bag now depicted here. They were selling black, with green or red.I mixed this in with my cat's usual scented, powdery ever-available litter. He used it fine at first. Tried to move over to just this litter gradually. Then he began to have more and more accidents outside the box. Then the more I cleaned his box, the more accidents he had.I do not always clean out his box daily - but that was NEVER a problem up until I bought this litter. It smells if not cleaned daily. And the cat started to go elsewhere. Then even when cleaned, he avoided it much of the time. I began to lurk around the box to see if he would use it, and it was upsetting to see it had hardly been touched.Have just replaced it with his old, which is irritating to my sinuses, but much more irritating to have to detect obnoxious cat accidents throughout the house. Be careful!"
1,"May Clump Well, But Wow It Stinks","This product makes high claims, starting with its superlative title. I can't really speak to how well it clumps, I generally use non-clumping clay, but I can say this: when used, it does not smell like ammonia. Unfortunately, it smells much worse. After a few days, it takes on the aroma of rotting food, like a bag of garbage left out in the sun.Perhaps if scooped every day, it does not develop this smell, and it really is the world's best cat litter. But I have a job, and a baby, and I don't scoop every day - and plain ol' clay works much, much better for me. I'll leave it on the shelf next time, and perhaps the Martha Stewarts of the world will use it and get great results."
1,They're peeing on my clothes!,"Terrible cat litter!We've never had a problem with our two cats pooping anywhere but the box untill we switched to this litter when Arm & Hammer discontinued thier flushable litter. Now, our cats will go anywhere BUT the box! And if and when when they do, the odor control is completely lacking. We clean our boxes twice a day. And ever since Science Diet changed thier ""Light"" cat food, believe me, our cat's butts STINK!And it's expensive!Please, Arm & Hammer, bring back your flushable litter. Please oh please."
1,how can these reviews be for the same product?,"I purchase a bag of World's best clumping letter after reading all of the stellar reviews on Amazon. I can't believe we're talking about the same product.This litter is dusty and high tracking. I have dark wood floors, and ever day I would have to clean the paw trail from the litter box to the rest of the house (yes, I also use a mat in front of the pan). Plus, the smell is quite strong and offensive. There is zero odor control. I got to the point where I was cleaning the pan after nearly every use! It didn't clump any better than every other clumping litter I've used.Save your money! Go for Tidy Cat multi Cat clumping litter. Trust me, it's far superior."
4,Healthy but stinky,"When I first started using this litter I loved the natural smell. Plus it felt great knowing my cats weren't licking something toxic off their paws. But this litter gets pretty stinky if you are not really responsible about keeping your litter box clean (I use a Litter Maid automatic litter box), and the clumps often break apart and get stuck to the rake. I'm still looking for the perfect litter."
3,Formula change?,"I used to set aside my concerns about flagging myself as a cat lady in order to rave about this product. I think they had a formula change though- it doesn't last as long as it used to. It still works great overall, but the wet clumps tend to crumble now and fall back into the litter, whereas the clumps used to hold so they could be sifted out, leaving the remaining litter still relatively clean and functional.I'll still keep using this product as there aren't any better brands, but it definitely doesn't compare to its own former self."
5,"A GREAT CAT LITTER, BUT FLUSH IN SMALLER AMOUNTS","This is the best cat litter I have ever used. Some say that it has a bad odor out of the bag - but I do not smell anything except a pleasant organic fragrance. My cat loves this litter. She has not tracked it about the house. It lasts for several days with a simple scooping out of any solid waste. The fact that it is flushable is wonderful, but I have learned to flush it in smaller amounts than other flushable litters. This is the best cat litter around!!"
4,"Easy to Install, Well Made",The two problems I had were:USB Cable too short for my caseDrive Face too Narrow for my bay.I had to modify the cable and my case to make it all fit tight.
1,Lenmar Lip -120 Panasonic Digital Video Replacement Camcorder Battery,"Received Lenmar FITS SHARP with a label on the back that says 120 Panasonic replacement. DOES NOT FIT THE PANASONIC CAMCORDER. LOOKS LIKE IT WILL ONLY BEING A BIT TALLER WHICH doesn't MATTER, BUT DOES NOT FIT THE PANASONIC MODEL IT CLAIMS TO FIT."
3,Seen Better,"Perhaps I have been spoiled by the excellence of Ken Burns. Nevertheless, I still expected better from the History Channel. Too often the same pieces are used over and over. There isn't enough organization to really hold one's interest for an extended period of time."
5,I love the History Channel Documentories,You can't go wrong with these shows. On a huge variety of subjects they just get better and better. And it teaches everyone things they didn't know. Smart viewing... must have
2,They've gone downhill,"It used to be that the center of the magazine contained recipe cards on near-cardstock. Now the ""cards"" are gone and in their place are recipes on regular magazine paper. Plus, advertisements used to be non-existant in the magazine, and I LOVED that. Now the pharmaceutical companies are pitching their drugs with ads that take up a full front and back of a page. In the most recent issue, Easy-Off oven cleaner has a full page add, and miscellaneous food/products have claimed spots in the magazine. It doesn't seem that the magazine has added pages to compensate for the ads, so that means less space for the articles and recipes. Sorry, but I just don't think I want to bother with it anymore."
3,Taste of Home,"I had subscribed to this magazine for several years and enjoyed it very much. I had let the subscription expire some 6 years ago and then renewed it, however, the magazine seemed to have changed and I no longer enjoyed It."
1,SCAM ALERT,"DO NOT SUBSCRIBE to this company...they will try to advance bill you for stuff you didn't order. I placed and paid for a one year subscription from Amazon.com ($5). After that I received a few bills from them for an annual cookbook I didn't order..when I didn't fall for their advanced billing tactic they then sent a letter from an ""in house"" collection agency called North Shore Agency. When I called to complain they ""forgave"" my balance and said I didn't owe them anything. This appears to be one of those scams where they fraudulent bill you and then try to scare you into paying for something you didn't order. Calls to customer service were nothing but a run around..IF YOU ORDER BEWARE!!"
1,Order if you want to be harassed and threatened,"Here is the excerpts of the letter I received after having just ordered the magazine and not yet receiving a bill:""We sent our magazine to you on the good faith and understanding that you would honor the invoice . . . """"We've kept our part of the bargain . . . if we do not receive payment within 15 days, we will turn your account over to our Credit and Collection Department""This is ridiculous. it is condescending and rude. I sent them their payment, and asked they refrain from sending me any publications from their company in the future. What happened to treating the customer with respect?"
2,Newer but not better!,"This magazine is definitely not the Taste of Home (TOH) it used to be. I had a subscription but did not renew because the recipes are not as good, the content has changed, there are more ads and it just isn't as enjoyable to read. It's OK but not what I expect from Taste of Home. From reading the other reviews Im not the only person who feels this way. If you are new to TOH and aren't comparing it to the older TOH you may not be as disappointed by the current publication."
2,Disappointing,"I have to agree with the previous reviewer, this is just not the same TOH it used to be. I used to be so excited when a new issue arrived, now it could sit for weeks before I open it, and even then I usually only peruse the pages and not really read the content. What used to contain no advertising, now does. The magazine itself has grown thinner through the years, the recipes not as down home as they used to be. What irks me more than anything is to see the great issues in the grocery stores that are not part of the home subscription (and cost $9.95 each at the store). Those issues look great - I only with they were offered with the home subscription.I was a loyal TOH subscriber for years and received my last issue - I will not be renewing, even with Amazon's low price subscription."
2,TOH added ads....,"and lacks recipes it used to have. I used to read every issue cover to cover and gladly pay the higher subscription cost. They reduced the cost of the subscription, added ads, cut the amount of pages and recipes in it and made it like other magazines. I loved this magazine to death before, now....I don't want to renew my subscription."
3,disappointing,"Not the original Taste of Home by far. I subscribed for years with the 'old' format and loved it. The new format reminds me of a recipe section from a Womans Day or Family Circle type magazine. Recipes don't seem to be as 'usable' and good as they were under the old format. Not going to renew again after many years of subscribing. Just ""OK"" but nothing to recommend."
1,taste of home,"I am very disappointed, I have not received my first copy yet...I am hopeful it will come soon...I KNOW i will LOVE the magazine...just waiting..."
5,Best cooking mag,"Best cooking magazine that exists! I subscribe to many cooking magazines, but Taste of Home far exceeds the others. Holiday issues are especially wonderful"
4,tears by hand,"This product is very handy to have around if you do not have a heavy-duty tape roll and dispenser with you.The price per square inch you get may be a little high, however.I used it for sealing packages and applying some decprations to glass and it seems to work as well as other sealing tapes, but easier to use because you have to try and use scissors on it while holding the roll."
4,easy to use,"The tape is really easy to use, since you can tear it by hand. I used it to pack three parcels, one of them was rather big and weighted over 10 lbs, and all of them arrived safely. The tape seems to be thinner then other mailing tapes, though, and it did not stick very well to cardboard boxes and was really easy to remove, which might mean that the package, especially if heavy, might burst during mailing."
5,Best Tape Ever,"Seriously, how do you review tape?IThis is the best packaging tape ever. I use the tape for minor product shipping and even Christmas present wrapping. The tape easily tears by hand and is somewhat forgiving when placing on a package (not wrapping paper though). The tape adheres very well though it seems as if it won't at times. The tape is simply the best."
4,Works as advertised ... quality product,"Scotch Tear-by-Hand Tape works just as advertised ... it seals boxes securely, but can be cut without having to resort to a pair of scissors or a tape dispenser.Now the only slight negative is that the Tear-by-Hand Tape carries a price premium over my current favorite,Scotch Super Strength Packaging Tape, and in my case I don't ship so many things that I would justify the added cost of Tear-by-Hand Tape. But by all means, if you don't feel like dealing with a dispenser or scissors then Tear-by-Hand Tape is a great product."
5,What's So Bad About Scissors?,"Amusingly, before I started taping up a bubble envelope with this tear-by-hand tape, I went and got a pair of scissors. I also had to repeatedly stop myself from reaching for the scissors, as I taped on a mailing label. You need no scissors. And fortunately there were no smudgy fingerprints on the tape either, when the taping job was done. It tears evenly, too. It's very nice tape, like most Scotch packing tape. But I'll probably just stick with Scotch tape that needs scissors. It just seems easier to me to use scissors than to use one's hands."
4,Convenient to use.,This tape is easy to use and sticks well. It tears by hand easily and doesn't tend to easily fold over on itself like a lot of packaging tape. It is sturdy enough to hold boxes made of heavy cardboard closed and I used it to tape boxes of storage for my classroom. Very handy to keep around and I like the fact I don't need a big bulky dispensor.
3,"Interesting idea, imperfect implementation","If you work with tape a lot, then the convenience of being able to tear it by hand might trump all other factors. But as I only send a package occasionally, I still prefer tape that comes from a dispenser. Why? When you tear a piece, corners tend to stick up. This is hard to describe, but trust me, it's an annoyance, and it means that you might need more tape in order to secure something. Another disadvantage of going dispenser-free: Finding the edge with your fingernail. We've all been there.I'd only recommend this tape in environments where kids are running around, since it makes sharp dispensers and scissors unnecessary."
4,"Good, light-duty mailing tape.","I haven't used this tape a lot yet, but I do find it handy to have around.It's a fairly typical packaging tape, good grip, but can be torn by hand. I used it for sealing some gifts in Amazon boxes, and it worked well for that. I don't know that I'll use it for shipping, it just doesn't seem durable enough. I do prefer heavy duty mailing/packaging tapes, and they typically have a serrated holder (or I tear the edge with my teeth or scissors). Overall, it's good if tearing by hand is what you're looking for."
4,Very pleased,"I havent had any issues tearing this tape by hand. I ship a lot of packages and I find this feature to be incredibly helpful. If you use a lot of packing tape, a tape gun would probably still be easier (makes finding the end of the tape easier) but if you don't ship every day, this tape a great alternative."
4,Easy to tear Strong tape,3M is a leader for a reasonquality product that works wellthis tape does indeed tear easilyalmost too easily as i have kids who constantly are using my packing tapeto hang their art all over the house or to create art projects with lolso have to be sure to hide this kind from them or they would be in craft heavenI have used it to ship with and the package made it to the destination just finewith no issues at all and this time of year seems to be harder on packages then other times of the yearat least has been my experience in past years when shipping Christmas presents all overalso used it to seal boxes as we pack for movingperfect since i do not need anyone to help me anymoremy work is going so much faster using this tapeit does what it claims - easy to tear by handand it is tape that seals and stays sealed what more can i saygreat product!!
5,Another great Scotch product,"When it comes to adhesives, Scotch is always the best. This tear-by-hand tape continues that tradition. It is clear and strong just like the normal scotch packing tape, but is easily torn by hand (and usually tears straight as long as you get the right start). It does not feel 'super sticky', but when you get it on your package and try to pull it off, you can see that it is indeed stuck on there pretty darn good! Unlike the bargain brands, it's thick so I don't have to worry that heavy boxes will 'pull through' the tape. Overall, I don't think I'd purchase this tape myself because it's more expensive than the regular stuff, and there's no real advantage to using this over the regular stuff. But, it does take up less space in the drawer, so if you're one for removing clutter, this product would be for you."
4,Great for occasional users,"This is exactly what it purports to be -- an excellent packing tape (always had great results with Scotch brand tape and adhesives) which can tear by hand rather than needing scissors, teeth, or a dispenser. However, it can be cumbersome if you are a frequently packaging. Since there is no dispenser, then when you use a roll, you let the tape stick back on itself -- necessitating that you find the edge and peel it back every single time you go to use it a fresh time. Not such a bad payoff if you're the occasional user and want to throw a roll in your desk drawer without a huge dispenser taking up room. But if you frequently package boxes for delivery, you'd be better off with the right tool for the job and that would involve a packaging tape dispenser and regular ol' packing tape will do in that case."
4,performs as promised,This Scotch Tear-by-Hand Tape works just as described. It's easy to tear straight across eliminating the need for me to use scissors. I have arthritis in my hands and the tape is still easy to use. I noticed that it does not curl up on itself like most other packing tapes try to do. A little more expensive than other packing tapes but I think it's totally worth it to have one less step to deal with.Very pleased with this purchase and highly recommended.
5,entertaining and educational,"This really is a remarkable book. There's absolutely nothing else like it. I bought it for my fourteen year old son and ended up reading it myself. We both love it. I'm a philosophy graduate and am astonished at how easily Law gets the big ideas across. Martians and monsters, wacky thought experiments, lots of different characters. If you want your kids to learn how to think for themselves, this is the book."
5,I love this album,"I think this is one of Sarah Slean's best works of art. Her skill of storytelling really stands out in ""Angel"" & ""Universe"". John 23rd is so amazingly beautiful. ""weight"" & ""I know"" are catchy. When this album came out, it was so expensive to purchase in the US, I could only find it from Canadian websites for $25.00 bucks, so for $6.00- $7.00 - you would be silly to pass this up this great album."
5,Sleeper Will Keep You Awake,"Once again the good doctor does what he does best and injects the reader with a healthy dose of suspense. In ""Sleeper"", his latest medical thriller, Barry Friedman, M.D. uses his lifetime of medical knowledge and experience to keep the reader guessing up until the very end. I enjoyed reading this book and am sure you will too."
1,Bracelet,"Took over a month to receive first order. Second order was shipped (as a replacement) and took longer than it should have to arrive. Neither order could be tracked online. Finally received the original order, and it had a scratch on the charm of the bracelet. When the replacement order arrived, it was a totally different style and size. It was the cheaper version of the one I had originally bought. (the difference between a $50 bracelet and a $36 bracelet. I was not aware a different bracelet was going to be shipped) Will not purchase from here again."
2,It's O.K.,"It fits the camera fine and has enough pocket space for the extra battery and card, but there isn't any easy way to hold it. No shoulder strap. there's a way to fasten it to a belt, but I don't wear a belt, so it's not so convenient."
1,A badly made musical,"The new FDS made a commotion here in Asia. It stars the first Asian Tony Award winner, Lea Salonga. Let me just say that she has a large following in Southeast Asia, and considered as one of the most talented singers around. However, the new FDS is a disappointment. The attack on Love Look Away is inappropriate. It is supposed to be a countertext song, however LEa delivered it like a Miss Saigon. Very typical. Jose Llana's voice is very nasal. At first, it sounds so earnest, but it gets to be a little bugging. The musical is so repetitive. I hope Lea would really analyze3 the material she is doing. Hope she learns to do proper character analysis. The rodgers and hammerstein material might not be well-known, but it is still a classic. If it cannot be done properly, do not tamper with it."
1,"oh gee, what a bummer","For those who loved the beautiful original cast album, this one is a stinker.Lea Salonga, who is supposed to have just come off the boat, sings with an American twang. In recognition of her star status, she sings ""Love Look Away,"" which was sung by another character in the original.For those who saw the Broadway play, the question was, ""Why did Lea Salonga play the demure girl with her brassy delivery? Shouldn't she have played the Americanized hotsy patootsie?"" Easy, if she played the one who sang ""I enjoy being a girl,"" she would have had to wear a towel (like Nancy Kwan) and she needs a beach towel to hide all that fat.Her singing is so far from the evocative one of Miyoshi Umeki.Henry David Hwang should be strung up for this parody he has made of a beautiful classic. Or maybe he should be forever condemned to mutilations of well loved plays."
5,Terrific show!,"Thanks in large part, of course, to the amazing Lea Salonga. The show was great (beautiful songs, powerful singing and acting, and wonderful costumes and choreography). Superb recording, too! A must-buy for amazon.com patrons..."
4,"Good revival - some of the updating works , some doesnt","I have to admit I miss the lyrics of the old "" Chop Suey "" and the the song "" The Other Generation"". Some of the re-written parts sound touching , some leadenly politically correct. Like the new orchestrations but some of the tempos are odd- e.g."" Love Look Away"" has some odd sections. The male lead and Salonga are quite strong vocally. Contrary to other review"" Love Look Away"" is NOT a duet."
4,"Great Score, Quirky Production","I actually liked this CD of the current Broadway revival more than I thought I would. Lea Salonga is an asset to any production and she shines in this production. This revival is saddled with a problematic book that leaves some people confused. For the most part, the CD contains the glorious R&H score. Sandra Allen is probably one of the weaker links on the CD. She has the big splashy ""Grant Avenue"" and for some reason, the interminable ""Fan Tan Fannie."" On the original Columbia cast album in 1958 that song was sung by another character and was mercifully shorter. Jose Llana has a glorious voices that soars when he sings ""Like A God."" There is a lot to quibble about over this new production and CD but it is enjoyable."
4,Recommended Reading by nervegas.com,"Complete Flea is a study of the flea in human culture. The author explores the flea as subject and artifact in art, poems, literature, and plays. It is typical to find books such as Complete Flea for other animals such as cats, dogs, etc...but a parasite is an unusual compilation.The book is illustrated with some nice detailed sketches of the flea from the advent of microscopy, as well as works from various artists.The Complete Flea says nothing of the incredible biology of the flea, its ecology, or habits. Rather it focuses purely on its impression on human culture, which has usually been non-disease related. For those that have a soft spot in their heart for these little wingless flies...Complete Flea will offer much intellectual fodder for conversation."
4,Academic Love,"Although this is a great book. It was a little more academic than I typically like to read. Filled with great information on the societal changes of the view of women's bleeding, the academic approach left me a little bored, but this is just my reading preference. If you are looking for a great book about mensturation, how to love your body, in a no nonsence, textbook way, this book is for you."
1,Waste of Money!,"I bought this because it said it would work with the NEEWER CN-160 LED Light, but it doesn't even fit! Word of advise. Don't ruin the packaging because then you won't be able to return it!... DO NOT BUY IF YOU ARE GOING TO USE IT FOR THE NEEWER CN-160!"
4,It works as I hoped,I have not used this item for more than a couple of weeks but it charged in a reasonable amount of time and I was able to video with no problems so the charger works as it was advertised.
2,Battery cgr-d220xl 7.2V 2400mAH,"I bought this battery for my Panasonic camera 3 weeks ago at Amazon.com. I only used it 3 times and discharge within 30 minutes. This battery should hold 2 hours on fully charge. I shoot wedding last weekened in Catholic Church, my battery that I fully charge only last 30 minutes. I have to change my battery the middle of the bows. Not good."
1,Extension cord would be a better description,This product description is very misleading. Amazon lists the retail price as $28 reduced to 13.99 but the APC web site lists the price at 12.99.... a dollar cheaper than Amazon. The low price makes sense because it only has 240 joules of surge protection per the APC specs (which amazon conveniently left out of the description). That makes it a little better than an extension cord. If you want real surge protection make sure you get something with a substantially higher joule rating.
2,"Old product, tested in 2004 but bought in 2011","I'm a little concerned about this product. When it arrived, it was apparent that the box was old, which was confirmed when I opened the package and a document stated that the surge protector was tested in 2004. When I looked on the box, it also indicated a product from 2004.I haven't used it because it was suppose to be a gift for a college student. I hope it lasts, despite the fact that it's already 7 years old!"
4,Baby likes it,"I actually have no idea whether the product provides any true relief from gas, but I do know our son stops crying and smacks his lips when we give it to him. Often that change of attention (to the good taste versus the gas pains) seems to be enough to allow him to fall asleep. When we've rocked, consoled, and walked him for long stretches of time with no end to his crying, it's nice to have a little something to help him -- and us -- get needed sleep."
5,instant results,"Recommended by a friend, the bottle of Gripe Water came today. I gave our 6-wk old baby a dose when she started ""crying for no reason"". She fell silent immediately! She really went from purple-faced to smiles within one minute! Amazing must-have for colicky babies!"
5,Great Product A+++++,"My wife and I had heard about this product from researching tummy aches and colic with new babies. We ordered the product thru Amazon.com and had it sent to friends who were coming down to visit us in Costa Rica. After the first use we could see the positive results with our 2 month old. We are very happy with the product and would recommend it to anybody that has children with colic, tummy aches or gas problems."
5,Sliding Mode Control,"The originator of sliding mode control (SMC), who has introduced a physical phenomenon, 'sliding mode' into control theory and has developped SMC over 50 years, presents the various most up-to-date SMC methods.""Sliding Mode Control in Electromechanical Systems"" emphasize on practical aspect of SMC, while the previous SMC book ""Sliding Mode in Control and Optimization"" has its focus on the theory. The practical examples involve pendulums, antennas, robotics manipulators, among others. Highly recommended for serious control engineers."
2,This tape sucks,"Made the mistake of buying this instead of the Heavy Duty that has the Blue label. This is not adhesive enough and feels flimsy. Very, very frustrating."
3,A bit light duty for mailing,"I usually use Scotch packing tape. The mailing and storage tape is lighter duty. I wouldn't purchase this for my purposes again, but it is adequate for storage. I ordered this weight in error and it would have cost me too much to return it."
5,"Great Service, Great People!","Good and courteus service, great product, great company and nice people to do business with, Sure would buy again if needed."
2,Not sticky enough - peels off,I've used a lot of packing tape over the years and I am dissatisfied with this brand. Although the tape is strong it doesn't stick to the boxes very well. I've come back to boxes that I back a few hours ago to find the tape has peeled right off.
1,Does not hold up in a hot attic.,"I purchased this tape to seal boxes that I would be storing in the attic. We have Brown Recluse spiders in the house and I didn't want them finding a home in the boxes being stored. I wanted a tape designed to handle the extreme temperatures found in an unconditioned attic space. Since this was advertised as ""designed with a long-lasting adhesive that works in hot or cold temperatures"", I ordered a 4-roll pack last fall and used it to seal several boxes. Unfortunately, the tape did not perform. After only a few months, the tape began pealing off all the boxes I applied it to."
3,Sealed most of the boxes,This worked out on some of the boxes but on other boxes then it didnt stick as well. I dont know if it was the boxes or the tape. All the boxes were the same so we will see over time if the rest come open or not.
5,"Strong, reliable product","Scotch seems to make the best packing tape for keeping things tightly locked/closed. I've used other products that are sometimes less expensive in the past and find that they easily start to peel after only a few minutes. This was a solid deal on Amazon, as usual."
3,Good value for the money,"You'll be getting 4 big rolls for around $9. As for the glue, I really didn't see much difference between this and other brands. I've noticed however that one needs to push a bit harder to surface, to get it really."
5,Great,It's a much better deal than buying it at my local store. It's the same exact product too! The tape works well.
4,It's tape!,"Yes, its tape! It sticks. But seriously, we bought some generic tape from Office Depot and it was TERRIBLE! Honestly, the generic tape was so thin that it was difficult to get off the tape gun without it folding onto itself and making a big sticky tape ball mess. Plus the cheap stuff smelled really bad too. Anyway, I'm a cheap bastard, but I'm never buying generic packing tape again. This pack seemed to be the best deal for Scotch brand packing tape. Oh, and by the way, we don't using it for moving and storage. We use it for just general use and it's great. Don't get caught up bu the name."
5,Scotch Brand Packaging Tape Review,"What can I say about Scotch Brand tape? It is and always has been the best tape company for a long, long time. Of course, this product is no different than all the other fine products that Scotch makes. I use a ton of packaging tape when shipping my eBay items and Scotch brand is always the sturdiest and easiest to work with. Yes, it is a little more expensive but it is worth it in the long run. There is never a problem with 'losing' the beginning of the tape on the roll and then wasting a bunch of it to get it started again. I highly recommend this product and the company that sells it. It's the best."
2,Disappointed in Scotch,"This is the first time I am disappointed in Scotch tape, but when I peel it off to start using it the tape is splitting. Very frustrating. This is why I usually pay extra for Scotch brand, to avoid that problem, but this particular tape is disappointing. In the future I will stick to their mailing tape."
4,Good basic tape,"Like another reviewer, I find that this tape needs some encouragement to stick to some boxes. But it's basically fine, and a decent all-around tape. I'm using it to seal up some boxes that will live in the garage for a while."
3,What is the deal?,I saw House of exorcism and I think it's pretty bad... But what is the deal to order the 2 movies Pack at 36$ when each of them are 13.50$ if you buy them separatly????
2,What???,"I saw a special on Mario Bava and it featured many of his horror films. They looked very interesting and interviwers said tha many of Bava's ideas were later copied by American filmakers. With that said ""Lisa and the Devil"" filmed in '76 is a mess of a movie. It makes no sense, and sometimes that's fun in a horror flick, but in this movie it's annoying and quite dull. I realize I saw this movie on cable but what happened to the exorcism scene that I saw in the special on Bava. Not that it would have made the movie any more intelligable, but at least a bit more interesting. Overall not a good movie."
1,Not Good,This is a poor product. The adjusting lock of the arm is weak and will move under normal operating pressure. Do not buy this product!!!!!!!!
5,Perfect and sturdy!,"Lid stays closed in windy weather and holds plenty of mail of all sizes and shapes. Love it, love it!"
4,mighty speakers,I HAVE USED THESES SPEAKERS MANY TIMES AND THEY ARE GREAT SPEAKERS.THEY HAVE GREAT SOUND AND I USED THEM IN ALL OF MY 6X9 ENCLOSER TRY THEM AND YOU WILL SEE WHAT I MEAN.DENNIS 2
3,Comino de la horca/ los tres moqueteros de dios,"I have to admit, i was not to trilled about this dvd, the frist story , a western was not that good,it lack that cowboy excitment, the second story was funny, and i like it. it made up for the first movie."
4,Using 3000 ISO Polaroid film,"Getting proper exposure, especially indoors with a flash, can take a couple tries. In the folding pack cameras, you may need to adjust the exposure control as incandescent light can throw off the exposure significantly. Aside from this, the shots you get from black and white film looks sweet. A nice change from 690 and 669."
4,Nice book,"This book will take you from A to Z but seam to be a little outdted because Studio Pro is now 4.0 but anyway, this book is well done. I will gladly share it to my videographer friends."
3,"Good, But!",Basically a excellent tutorial and reference. But unfortunately falls into thedo-everything cracks by forcing someone who wishes to produce a simple slideshow only to learn all about how to create complex video audio supported programs. Before the user can put together a slide show they will have to learn many functions that have no relation ship to what they ultimately want wind up with.
5,Laura's garden,"I love Thimbleberrie's books very much, the instructions are easy to follow, especially for a beginner like myself. I am sure I will find something to sew out of the book. I have alot of her other quilting books. Sewed several projects out of them also."
3,Nice pictures-dated information,"I bought this to plan a northern California trip and it had some really nice pictures, but the information was dated and while quite specfic directions were given to each site I had to use other references to plan routes from one site to another. It describes the sites quite well and is useful in helping decide what you would like to see, but of little use in planning a trip."
5,Very thorough,"The book is wonderful. It shows detailed technichues for making laces with a sewing machine, which could be adapted to digitizing your own designs and laces for embroidery machine."
1,Beware - contains undesirable products for certain people,"It's your basic Acerola supplement but be aware that it will contain GMO products such as soy, very likely rBGH milk product, peanuts, and sorbitol. Since it is made using products that process these above mentioned products, it will contain these undesirables which are not good for you!"
3,A Different View of 9-11,It is well that 9-11 be observed through the eyes of average people. Too many books are more concerned with the nation's interests and not about the personal emotional costs.
3,Makes Me Angry,"Reading this book makes me angry at the 9-11 hijackers and the world of people who support suicide bombings. These people claimed to be coming here for an education, and that America needed to help them. They betrayed us.About half of the text humanizes the victims, and about half describes the terrorists and their families and backers. The information is not well-footnoted. For instance, there is a reference to Saddam's links with Al Qaeda that I had never heard before, but where Der Spiegel (the German magazine that produced this book) got its information was impossible to tell.The most memorable piece of info I gleaned from this book is that Marwan Al-Shehi the Islamic fanatic homicide pilot enjoyed going to strip bars while he was here. Go figure."
1,Rubbbbish,"Bla bla bla. Read ""Inside Job"" by Jim Marrs and watch the DVD ""9/11 In Plane Sight"", maybe you'll learn the truth!"
3,Half of what I was looking for,"I really wanted a detailed account and analysis of the events of that day and that first half of this book does just that in a gripping (though slightly truncated) fashion. Unfortunately, the rest of it gets lost in the minutae of the investigation in Germany, background of terrorist groups, and personal details of the lives of survivors. Nicely done, but not totally what I was after."
5,TRUE DEPTH OF 9-11,"""Inside 9-11: What Really Happened"" does not cover up the missed opportunities America had that could have stopped the massacre. It offers reason to why ""they"" hate America. The portraits of the terrorists are very well defined, especially how they trained and staged their attack. This is a must read if you want to know the terrorists and their victims."
4,Works Well For Storing My Flat Iron,"I bought this to store my flat iron in. It works well for that purpose. I wasn't over the moon about it, but for it's intended purpose it works well. What would make it even better is if it had more than just a Velcro flat over the end opening."
1,Not worth watching twice,"Well I was an ICP fan but this video made me think twice. This video is dumb, those pictures in the back well those matches dont even come out on the video. Its nothing but bad words coming out of both the clowns mouths for an hour its not even that funny.They cant even get the names right the 2nd time they say them.THIS IS A BAD VIDEO AND ITS NOT WORTH BUYING.It sais its NC27 but the video for another love song is EDITED and dumb too. So your better off borrowing somebody else's copy.This video is old too"
3,Stranglemania 2 Lacks Good Matches but not Comedy...,"Now,I watched and cryed <Laughter> when I 1st watched Stranglemania 1,but this one pretty much lacks in the Match Quality Dept.The matches suck badly,trust me watching people like Mr Pogo-Onita for the 100th time gets on your nerves,but The Comedy is still fresh as hell!Trust me watching The Vintage Footage and the Commentary from 3-D <Violent J> and Gweedo <Shaggy 2 Dope> from ICP is as funny as it gets.Johnny Stark <Jamie Madrox from Twiztid> joins the crew and adds some funny a** words.Its a good ICP video but not Great."
5,So you think WWE is hardcore?,"All i can say is WOW. This is real life hardcore wrestling from japan, not any of that backyard [material] they advertise for on latenight tv. Carnage is the best word to describe it. ICP does an awesome job commentating and makes this tape a must see for the fans of ""extreme"" wrestling. But not for the squemish by any means!"
3,UHHHHHHH!!!!!!!,If you like ICP you'll like the commentary but other wise there aren't many matches so don't let the box fool you.But after the wrestling check out the cool BIG MONEY HUSTLA$ preview it's hilarious!
5,Excellent Protection,"I have used these protectors in Africa in areas with very high lightning incidence and had zero damage to computers or equipment they protected. Highly recommended. Quality construction, components and design."
3,Handle the surge,"I live in Surge City and Ground Zero for lightning. We need surge protectors for our surge protectors. So I've had some experience with APC. Note that if you file a claim with APC for damage reimbursement, the process is arduous and they demand that you send back the protector for thorough testing by their lab. So keep the box. If the protector is not blown on their tests, then no reimbursement. This unit installed nicely on the wall and hopefully will protect the new boards on the washing maching ($650)."
4,Surge protector,"I bought 3 of these, one for each ""system"" I have in our house. I bought mostly for its reputation. There's nothing really to fault with it because when I really need it would indicate a disaster would have happened. Plug ins plug in easy? Thats it and hope it works ""when"" I need it."
2,Selling OLD products???,I just received this in Dec. 2011 and yet inside the unit was inspected in 2007. So i was sold a product that is almost 5 years old that was just sitting around in a box. Actually the box had other upc stickers over the original ones but I couldn't remove them to see if the numbers were the same.I contacted APC and they said if you want newer items to purchase items thru them but it still has a lifetime guarantee. Still not happy about this purchase. It was sold thru Amazon but thru Hohertz Technologies LLC.
2,Nice glasses till you wash them,"My wife & I recently ordered three sets of these glasses. One of the sets was missing a glass when it arrived, but that's another story :) Upon initial inspection of the glasses they seemed well worth the money. There were no defects with any of the glasses themselves (chips, etc.) and the painting on them looks very nice. However, be very careful when washing them. If the water temperature is any warmer then cool (as the enclosed slips of paper warn), you will instantly lose the paint on the base of the glass. For some reason, the paint on the upper portion of the glass seems at least a bit more durable. Also, for whatever reason, Block Basics stuck a circular glued on tag on the top of the base covering a portion of the paint. I have found no way of removing these tags, including soaking the glass in cold water, without losing the paint that is under them. I'd have rated these glasses a minimum of 4 stars if the paint job was more durable."
2,Animal lovers beware!,"I enjoyed reading the book until about halfway through - there are a few instances of animal abuse (particularly about horses) that really bothered me, so I won't finish the rest of it because I don't know what other upsetting things might be contained in the book. Was the author trying to illustrate the rough, tough life of the Canadian wilderness? If so, I know I won't do any sightseeing there! If you love animals alot like I do, find something else to read!"
2,Disjointed; flits like a bee from flower to flower,"This book sounded so appealing on the dust jacket, and in these reviews. I am sorely disappointed! I have found it to be very disjointed, flitting from one subject to another, and one timeframe to another all in the same chapter!Perhaps the author meant to do this -- people's thoughts do go off on tangents, like bees flying from flower to flower. However, that style got old quickly, and I only got halfway through the book before returning it to the library. Save your money, and borrow it from the library!"
4,A relaxing yet page turner once again,"I have read as many books of Lori Wick's as I could find and so far have enjoyed them all! In this book I think that so many people look at the words, which may include some sexism, and not at the real meaning behind the book. I have found that in every one of Mrs. Wick's books there is a meaning beyond the word and usually contains the message of what God expects from a loving relationship. It's not my absolute favorite, but it is deffinitly high on my list!"
3,lost it's point,I really liked this book and found that it wasn't sexist at all. In fact what bothered me is that the man wimped out at the end in my opinion. He was concerned for her safety and rightly so. The husband is suppose to be the head of the home but if the wife can't be trusted then that isn't a good foundation either. I felt that the female character was in the wrong and should have appologised for not being trust worthy.
5,Creative!,"Mrs.Wick writes great books,but this is one of my favorites.I enjoyed it mostly becouse the main charactor isn't a sweet homey girl who's always pretty and clean.And she isn't always behind a man screaming in a gun fight.She has courage and faith.That's what makes this book so great."
3,Slightly Disappointed,"Although I'm a Lori Wick fan, I was very disappointed in this book. The blurb was really good, but the book just did not live up to expectations. The main characters were sappy and I just couldn't relate to them. I found myself more interested in Dakota, a secondary character, than Liberty and Slater."
3,It was OK.,"I just wanted to write to address what the other reviewers wrote about concerning the sexism in this book. For one thing, men ARE supposed to be the head of the home and the head of the woman. The Bible says so. If you don't believe me, look it up in your Bible.The man in this book is not overbearing or unrespectful to the woman, he simply cares for her and for her safety. And, like a lot of people, he struggles with pride. But I think deep down it was not pride, it was just that he felt it was his place, not hers. And I agree. And, no, I'm not a man writing this--I am a 20-year-old girl. Surprised? Don't be. We need to bring back the standards that are not tossed by the wayside. To any of you that agree with me, just wanted you to know that it's ok to be old-fashioned in your standards. I suppose some people say the Bible is outdated too, does justify anything? NO"
4,every little thing about you,This was the first book of hers I read. The story line was good and easy to follow. The only trouble I have with her books is I can't put them down! I love her charactors and the way she brings the Bible into every day life.
1,Every little thing about you,"The title sums this book up ""Little Thing"". After reading ""Sophie's Choice"" by Lori Wick I guess I had too high expectations, because this book was not only boring but had very little plot line. It was all I could do to finish it."
1,Boring,"This book was way beneath what Ms. Wick is capable of writing. NO plot, definitely not a page turner. Perhaps the 13 to 15 year old would find it somewhat interesting. A real disappointment as the majority of Wick's books have a much better story line."
3,Disappointed with my favorite author,"I've read all of Lori Wick's books and enjoyed each one; _Every Little Thing About You_ was no exception. Still, I felt disappointed at the end of this book -- characters seemed shallow and the plot never headed anywhere, just finally made it. Although I've enjoyed Wick's latest slew of books (3 in the last year), perhaps she's working through them so fast that this one did not get the attention it deserved. I'll read the rest of the series and hope it improves."
3,Another warmhearted western romance,"Deputy Liberty Drake arrests Texas Ranger Slater Rawlings after he's caught with a gun in a saloon, which would be normal for the Old West, but apparently is against the law in the fictitious Shotgun, Texas. Slater is drawn to the homey little town and to its church, as well as to the feisty Liberty, who veers from being overly saccharine to being outright antagonistic. She does something to Slater's visiting brother, Dakota, towards the book's conclusion that made me want to slap some sense into her. That she has to give up a job she loves and is good at because it's not feminine is my main problem with the book. Otherwise, the characters are funny and sweet, although the historical detail might not always be spot on."
5,"Female Deputy Arrests Former Texas Ranger,I Love Humor Mixed With My Romance!","All three books in this Yellow Rose Trilogy had humor in them,but it was more of a factor in this one.We get to know all three of the Rawlings brothers better in this book,and it seems a shame to end the series now!It was a pleasure to get to know the characters and read about the wonderful family situations. It's fun to watch the romance develop between Slater and Libby Drake.A lighthearted,fun romance read."
5,Dr. Dyer at his best,"This series of CDs is absolutely wonderful and very inspirational! I listen to it in the car and when I get to work I am a different person. Please do yourself a favour and reward yourself with this exceptional course on how to be inspired and live at peace with yourself and the Universe and reap the rewards of doing it! And it's all so simple, Dr. Dyer uses every day language that we can all understand, and his examples are spot on. Some of the stories from his personal life are quite funny, especially the one about the butterfly (my kids love it). Hope you enjoy this too..."
2,choosing a cruising sailboat,"I do not feel this boat is for the novice sailor. I have been thinking about getting a sail boat which my wife and I could cruise on and thought this would be a great book for picking up a few tips. It was a lot more technical then what I was looking for. I wasn't looking to build a boat, just buy one. It may be a great book for an old sailor but not a new to sailing guy like me. I did pick up a few pointers and I may pick up more if I were to read it again in a few years, after I become more experienced."
3,Only good for rich folks!,"Written in a clear and beautiful style, lots of helpful diagrams, BUT... I am interested in single-handed ocean cruising, and I want a 26-30 foot boat. Yep, it would be more comfy if I could afford a 45-50 footer, but that's just not realistic for the average person with a dream. If you could afford a boat that size, you can probably afford a designer of your very own and thus wouldn't need this book."
3,"Fun to read, but more than you need.","This book starts by giving you an exam and rates your experience. Don't be discouraged by the exam, it isn't valid and I doubt it is reliable. Nevertheless, Marshall has some great technical information on all sorts of things to consider when you select a boat. Best of all he has a spread sheet of statistics on a large number of production boats. Selecting a boat is much of the fun of owning a boat and this book helps with the fun. The information doesn't seem to be unique, but it is well enough presented to make it worth while looking at, especially if you are new to sailing."
2,decent but not as good as it should be,"So I understand that these are from a private collection and that the content is limited. However, I would not consider the most ""bizarre"" among yoshitoshi's work to be included in this book. Half of the prints are black and white, most are distorted and almost all are extremely small. pretty disappointed in the imagery of this book. However, the detailed captions and info are great. If you are looking for yoshitoshi's most visually stunning works, you won't find them in this book."
3,Good but dated,"There is some valuable information in this book. Unfortunately, you have to wade through chapters on Teas, Debutantes, Country Houses, Balls, Club Etiquette, Position in the Community, Household Help and other subjects. The book was published in 2007, but there is no information about the edition date. I suspect it might be a soft cover of the 1922 edition. The book is over 400 pages of small print with no index and there is also no copyright date, which is puzzling. The book is an amusing look into the inner workings of ""society"", but not for people looking for a practical etiquette book."
2,Old Fashioned,"My main complaint is that it is impossible to use the kindle version of this book as a reference book as there is no navigation between chapters, nor is there a table of contents."
4,Great for understanding the 'spirit' of etiquette,"While the book is chock full of detailed what to and not to do, the most impressive points to me were the explanations of why certain etiquettes exists. Putting heart in to what's usually regarded as a mental or social game, Ms. Post breathes a life of understanding into what otherwise would be a trite lexicon of customs. To the modern individual, it promotes ideas of selfless acts and words to create a better society, just be advised of the pitfalls of judgementalism, acts for the sake of routine, and false demeanor. Putting these latter three social sins aside, the book can be quite beneficial as well as enjoyable!"
3,"Outdated, but fun","If you are looking for a proper etiquette book for the modern American, this is NOT for you. As a historical document it's fascinating, but that's about all.The book is divided into sections on how to greet people, how to act when passing on the street, how a gentleman lifts his hat when meeting someone on the street or inside, what to do in a theatre,and how to make sure that all ladies are sent to their carriage before the last man can leave a public place. I haven't gotten through it all, because the language is stilted and it is so clear that this was meant for the rich America in the 20's when it was first written."
5,Good look into a past era,"Neat to see how everyone was supposed to act in the early 1900s, although it is not current, it is still a good read..."
4,lacks table of contents/navigation but GREAT,This book is tasty reading about a fading trait- manners. In the text and me/me/me world I long for the care and forethought of 1922. Soothing.
4,Manners get you through the day,"I've used the hardback copy since high school! YES, through parties, dating, balls, teas, weddings, thank you notes, setting tables, divorces, writing your congressman, etc. I have to admit I haven't looked at it in about 10 years, but I think it's a good read for anyone. A few manners won't hurt anyone. I haven't yet had a chance to see my kindle version and from what I've read there's no index. Are you SURE? Sometime you have to go back to the cover and thumb through page by page to see the Index. If none, that is certainly a drawback since one needs to be able to go to the right subject as the occasion occurs. Then I'd recommend an updated version - especially if you are young (13 and up) and just ""beginning life""."
1,Ok but not great,This book is a good reference to have on the shelf. I would not recommend reading it or buying it unless you have nothing else to do.
5,This band deserved better,"I wasn't coming here to write a review, but after seeing the low ratings, I had to even things out. I was listening to this CD today, and was sad to see it was almost 10 years old, and nothing much came of the group. I just think this is a beautiful album with very few, if any, weak spots. It's a really original and creative work of music, but I guess people don't get anything without screaming vocals and distorted guitars."
2,"Like her voice, El President, but not much else","Like the summary says, her sexy voice is the albums shining spot and sounds great with Thom Yorke. The best thing that came from this album for me is a newfound respect for Thom Yorke and Radiohead and I do truly love El President. The rest of the album is too repetitive and gets a little tedious, it is starting to grow on me though."
2,"Many of the songs have the same ""sound"". It gets boring.","While the lyrics are unique and dreamy, the sound is repetitive in many the songs on White Magic For Lovers.Drugstore needs to expand on their sound and change pace to keep me interested."
2,Flatlands with a couple peaks,"I bought this because I liked the song ""El President"" which I had seen on M2. I knew nothing of the band or song (not even the Radiohead connection). I still like ""El President"". I think the ethereal laments punctuated by Spanish flamenco style guitars works well.However the rest of the album is pretty lackluster. ""I Know I Could"" has some moments of interest for me, and ""White Magic for Lovers"" has a moody aura, but other than that the CD gets pretty standard.What is interesting to me is that many of the songs sound a *lot* like ""My Bloody Valentine"" gone pop. I really liked MBV's ""Loveless"" album because of it's wall-of-noise and very non-pop sound. Cleaning up that sound for the mainstream takes out the most interesting aspects, which is how I see many of the songs on ""White Magic for Lovers"".Since it has some sparks of originality, I gave it a 2 instead of a 1."
4,Very good book,"I bought this book because it was cheap, but seemed semi-interesting; I didn't think I would ever pick it up. When I did open it I found it fascinating. There are many proofs and theory, but it is not too difficult. I'm not finished it, but I recommend this book to anyone with a background in mechanics."
5,Nothing New?,As the author of this book I can tell you definitively that the quotes Trisha Brudsal put in her review do not exist on the CD. You can read the first two chapters of the book or listen to the first track of the CD by going to KellyBurris.com.
2,Editor needed,"This author may have some wonderful ideas, but the book is very poorly written. Reading it was unbearable. Where were the editor and proof-reader?! I had to give up about a third of the way through. It's hard to trust someone as an expert when he doesn't have the sense to present his ideas intelligently."
1,Wordy and condescending,"This is one of the worst self-help tapes I've ever had. Burris spends half of the CD over-explaining his basically simple visual/verbal system. He provides little or no experiential guidance, just a lot of over-detailed verbalizations as to why we shouldn't picture ourselves or call ourselves fat. Plus he uses bad grammar."
5,Mind Over Matter,"I really enjoyed Kelly Burris' audio book. I have been studying diet, nutrition, and exercise for 30 years, and Kelly's tenets ring true. There really wasn't anything I would disagree with in the book. We are powerful beings if we would just access that power of the mind. It doesn't have to be a difficult process to lose weight and be fit if you are committed to truly changing the way you think. This book can help you do this. I am sending a copy to a family member with a weight problem(really a mind problem--the weight is just the symptom) and hopefully she will be as excited by it as I am. I also enjoyed Kelly's voice--enthusiastic, positive, and supportive at the same time. Finally someone has written a book that gets to the crux of overweight issues. This book could change your life. I highly recommend it. I wish my sister would have read this book before she had gastric by-pass surgery to lose weight. Thank you Kelly Burris."
4,i chalking funny,i use it an my friens shay i chalk funny. i soooo upshet! oh chap! this shucks!Hoo Boo
1,Limited interest for US readers,"10 years is a long time in high technology, and alarms sytems are based on high technology. So this book is now of mainly historical interest and for background reading.Compounding this issue for non-UK residents, is the fact that the book was written in the UK, by a UK engineer about UK alarm sytems. These differ quite significantly from those used in the USA. There are different regulatory standards and quite different customs and practices.When published, the book was an exceptionally useful volume and it highlighted for me the mystery of why there was no equivalent in the USA, nor is there today. Mr. Cumming should update his book and someone in the US should take it as a model for a book about US alarm systems."
2,"Security: A Guide to Security System Design and Equipment Selection and Installation, 2nd Edition","This book was published 15 years ago in 1992. Like all technology, security system design and equipment improves at a dramatic rate (on a yearly basis). The information in this book is not relevant to today's available technology. There are better resources out there."
1,"Security: A Guide to Security System Design and Equipment Selection and Installation, Second Edition","I teach Electrical Contractor exam preparation classes for the NJ State Licensing ExamI could not believe it when I saw the book's publishing date of 1992. A book about any kind of electrical and/or electronic products that is 16 years old is obsolete.The basic principles may still apply, but it certainly is way out of date due to the advance of technology.I feel like I threw $80 out the window."
1,Not really a direct NP-F730 replacement (or even NP-F730H),"This battery does NOT fit the Sony DCR-VX1000 video camera, which comes with a Sony NP-F730 (as labeled on the battery itself). It lacks the grooves along the sides so it will not slide into the camera body. Most disappointing to find this out when I needed the battery most."
5,A Most Practical Guide to Spiritual Living,"This book by Joel Goldsmith is very practical and straightforward in showing the reader how to bring the presence of God into daily life. As one reads and questions or thoughts arise, the answer or further explanation is not far behind. It is as if one were having a conversation with Joel in that moment. A must read"
2,Could have told us more,"It was an okay read, but most of the information here was on bad treatment of the animals. Not that this isn't important, but I wanted to know more about the things that we are eating. More about the use of sick and diseased animals. The animals are going to die and the plants aren't pretty (Just drive around Greely, CO) The smell would make most of us very ill, but that is what they do to get the food to us.I wanted to know about the hormones, chemicals, diseases. She should have covered more of that. Not really worth 20 bucks"
2,Shocking but Not Accurate,"This book was fairly well researched, but then again how reliable is the testimony of the people that she used? Granted, there are times that the employees are mistreated at the time of stunning, but that's few and far between. Slaughtering of Red meat livestock has never been a pretty sight, i will say(since my father was a professional slaughterer and butcher for 28 years), but generally the treatment of the animals is godd. Once again, take into consideration this is an animal rights activist writing this book, so she's lacking some well founded research from the top meat and livestock science departments in the United States. Please take this book with a grain o' salt!"
1,Stick with the original version of this book....,"It was done in 1905. Was once called ""THE JUNGLE"" by Upton Sinclair. Done far better then too. Avoid this remake. Much like Hollywood remake of classics, it does a true disservice rather than anything else."
5,Truly a Shoking Look at the Meat Industry,"Eisnitz does an absolutely amazing job of presenting the facts of the meat industry system. She approaches the topic from several distinct views, raning from the treatment and abuse of slaughterhouse workers, to the cruel grotesque way in which the animals are raised and slaughtered, as well as the political motivations that allow the industry to persist on in this illegal and inhumane mode of operation. Ultimately, Eisnitz reveals how the meat industry puts profit above the our safety (through diseased animals, bacteria, feces, and other contamination), non existent worker ""safety"", and she presents how the meat industry makes a mockery of our elected governemnt, with the USDA protecting profits, not us. THIS IS THE MOST ENLIGHTENING AND DISTURBING BOOK THAT I HAVE EVER READ. PLEASE READ THIS BOOK VEGETARIAN OR NOT, IT WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE, AND ULTIMATELY ARMED WITH THIS INFORMATION THE MEAT INDUSTRY CAN BE REFORMED."
5,Read this book,"This book was written over ten years ago, population then, and meat consumption was not as high as it is today. Imagine how the profiteers behind the meat market have to rush these animals through the massacre to provide for the needs of a ever hungrier and misinformed population we have now.This book was the last drop into a series of books that made me give up eating meat entirely. No wonder they never allowed it on that 60 minutes show, but after all these years the truth is coming out, slowly but surely.All that is told by Gail is something that will mark you. Read it, learn it, change your ways."
5,A must read for all meat-eating adults!,This book was required reading for my Vet Tech daughter. She found it to be an informative yet shattering read. Good price & fast delivery.
5,slaughterhouse,"I read this book a couple of years ago. Very moving, shocking, and true. I am a vegan, but you might at least consider not eating meat ever again after reading this book. If you can make it through this book, I would like to suggest renting the dvd ""EARTHLINGS"" I know netflix has it, a must see."
5,Love it,"Very well written, this book is truly an eye opener as to what's happening in the slaughterhouses. I actually caught myself crying in some parts! As graphic as it is, I would recommend Slaughterhouse to anyone who is interested in learning the truth about what you are actually putting into your body."
3,"Good, but repetitive","I've read some other similar works, such as Animal Factories by Mason/Singer. I consider it to be a superior work as it had more statitics and references. This book often feel like you're reading the same chapter again and again. She would go into various types of slaughterhouses, such as pig, cow, even horse. And the story she would tell may differ in the details, but still be basically the same.One thing that I did find intersting is that while I was aware that horsemeat is sold in other countries, I did not know that we export significant quantities of it. If you haven't read any other work on the meat industry, then you need to read this one. If you've read some others, you can probably skip this one."
5,A painful but necessary eye-opener.,"I highly recommend Slaughterhouse to anyone who is brave enough to discover how animals become meat. Although I already avoided meat for personal reasons, I was still horrified and saddened by the gruesome facts in this book, many of which I was ignorant. The toll upon the workers in this industry, the safety and health of the public, and the tortured deaths of the animals themselves is enough to make anyone think twice about supporting the industry. I challenge anyone who eats meat to read this book and try to remain unchanged."
1,Stupid.,"Any book like this is stupid. Mao made a lot of mistakes that is true. People suffered during the culture revolution and things like that. However any sane historian should also see the much more bright side of Mao. People suffer much more before Mao and without Mao people in China right now might possibly live miserably. This book is just a simple and stupid American/Western point of view without fully understanding of China. So I agreed, this book should change its title to I HATE MAO."
1,a very bad book,I always knew Mao was an SOB but the person described in this book just stumbled into history and didn't have any real abilities. He was evil and the people around him weak. There was no objective analysis and every issue was presented one sided - Mao liked nobody - not even his family. I find it hard to believe he rose to the position he did based on my only reading of this book. I did not enjoy this book - not entertaining - not analytical - just a laundry list of evil acts with interpretations that had no backing.
2,Biased history,"Ms. Chang obviously dislikes Mao very much. I am not a Mao defender -- much of what he did matches the actions of Stalin or Hitler -- but history is best presented as evenly as possible. There were times when I felt that Ms. Chang's hatred of Mao was clouding her description of events. After reading ""Mao: The Unknown Story"" I do not feel that I have been given the complete story."
3,Tiresome writing style,"This book may be the best ever written about Mao and the horrors he perpetrated on the Chinese people. However, I found the book tiresome to read. The authors make it clear in every section that the material is another example of how power hungry, ruthless and brutal Mao was in his mission to rule China. The authors did not have to explicitly explain it time and time again. The narrative brings home their points making the explicit statements unnecessary.As another reviewer commented, its not clear how Mao gains support of the masses of middle and lower level party members even as he has other murdered and tortured. There must be some reason for his success in building a loyal following that would carry out his brutal orders.I would not recommend it for a casual reader."
2,Disappointingly biased history,"I am no Mao fan; nor am I a Mao apologist. There is no doubt that the Chinese people suffered greatly during the whims of Mao's reign, and that many people continue to suffer today. However, my objections to this book is that it is painted as a scholarly work, and as it is one of the most biased histories I have ever read, I find that I view the whole work as flawed.There are many sweeping assumptions about Mao's motivations, gleaned from scant or small pieces of evidence, or interviews with third parties. Some of them seem so far fetched that I found myself cringing.I have read ""Wild Swans"" and enjoyed it as much as can be said for such a harrowing story. However it is with this knowledge that I can see what the authors are trying to achieve with this book. They do achieve it, and have stirred up considerable controversy with this work, but I feel some of the scholarly merit has been lost in the ranting."
3,"Interesting, but...","I liked the detail (it's a thick book) and I liked the writing. However, the tone at times gets a bit too ""political hack job"" for my taste. The facts of Mao's heinous crimes against his own people speak for themselves. To me, the author could have toned down some of the highly charged invective and deleted some of the unfootnoted (and therefore suspect) accusations without harming the message. Indeed, I think it would have improved the read for me.But, if you already have a visceral hatred of Mao and want to feed it, this book has lots of calories for you."
1,a book full of misuse and misinterpretation,"I kept reading this book for half month then gave up--no need to waste more time. This is a book full of misusing of materials and misinterpretation. For people who lost their father or mother in the culture revolution like one of the author, they have all the rights to hate Mao personally. But this does not mean that they can misinterpretate history from a very biased view. There are many times during my reading that I just laughed out how the authors try to portait Mao as an uncomparable evil monster. It is no doubt Mao has many shortcomings and many very wrong decisions. But it is so funny to try to describe him as a such monster full of horrible evils.If you do not want to waste time, no need to read this. If you want to read for fun and see how biased a book could be, 1/3 of the whole book is enough."
3,Groundbreaking information to the sound of an axe grinding,"This book contains 1000's of facts which together confirm that Mao was paranoid, undercut rivals before they became rivals, had perhaps the biggest ego this side of the 19th century and for the most part made it all up as he went along. If only those same facts could have been presented by the authors without the authors revealing, from page one, that they have an axe to grind. Kudos to the authors for digging so deep and tapping into so many original sources. But they also tip their hand too often, and give one the sense that their sources revealed to them just what they expected to find. In short, I doubted the authors' objectivity, and that spoiled the book for me."
1,such a biased book,"I wonder whether the writers know how to write in an objective way. They ignored or delibrately chose to neglect facts that did not support their views, and only mentioned facts consistent with their views. They first set up a theory, ""Mao is evil, ruthless, bad, bad and bad."" Then they tried to attribute the facts listed in the book to this evil nature of Mao. This is so judgemental, not an objective way to represent history."
2,The mao-maoing of Mao,"Unfortunately, this exhaustive tattle-tale of Mao has all the earmarks of an insider's pisstake on a former hero with whom the biographer became disillusioned. Author Jung Chang was a Red Guard at the age of 15, but grew to despise the party and its leader, as is made abundantly clear in this hideously revisionist examination of the Chinese Communist revolution. The obivious problem is that neither Chang nor collaborator Haliday are particularly distinguised historians, nor do they prove up to the task of taking on the monumental historical figure of enormous complexity that was the real Mao. Having lived a third of my life in East Asia, I am acutely aware of what passes for scholarship there but what is often merely biased translation of anecdotal heresay. I suspect that much of this book consists of just that, and not much more."
4,Want to see in on Kindle page,"I got this book as a hardcover from Amazon while I was in Shanghai China. It got past the censors who open every package that comes to China. My thinking is that the censors do not speak English so did not know this book is an excellent critical review of Mao. I read this book in China, but left the book in China.I now want to read it on my Kindle but it does not show up there. So, please publisher, put this on the Kindle page at $9.99 and I will be the first ones to buy it again.StevenOregon"
5,"A real sleeper, an extraordinary book","Not since the gossipy-hearsay-rumor plagued ""Tragedy and Hope"" has there been a book that challenges so many assumptions about 20th century Asian history. The Amount of documentation is seriously impressive and presented in a very user-friendly way that doesn't detract from from the easy-reading style. If you were ever curious about how Mao created his mystique and starved tens of millions of his own countrymen, you will find it here, in detail."
1,Both authors are disgusting liars,"Well,this book sure will appeal to all anti-China or anti-Chinese readers.So enjoy all the lies,distorted facts, and made-up stories."
2,Mao: The Untold Story,"This is horribly written and subjective on the part of the author. It is is poor ""reportage"". It was hard to get through because of the writing. However, the facts are interesting enough to slog through it."
1,This book is for western audience,It is interesting that many westerners are full of praise of this book and yet most Chinese think this book distorts mao's accomplaishment. It just shows that the book is published for western audience who do not share the same historical perspective of the Chinese.
4,The other side of the story,"""You can't make an omelette without breaking some eggs,"" Stalin is said to have replied to a critic of his collectivization program that cost twenty-million Russians their lives. Mao's policies got his total up to sixty-million, or more. How high would his score have to had been for his present-day admirers to admit that he was no Gandhi? And, by the way, people aren't eggs!Apologists for Mao need to read this book for the other side of the story."
4,"Highly enjoyable, but doubtful research","As long as one takes Chang's research with a grain of salt, then this is an immensely enjoyable, readable, and accessible book. The research seems good, but Chang's conclusions are almost laughable; she cites one or two sources (sometimes Communist sources, always of doubtful trustworthiness) and comes to conclusions that should send off red flags according to just their language: ""This must mean..."" ""There is no other interpretation but..."" And it can't be coincidence that all of her research unwaveringly supports her main tenet, that Mao is a monster. But the errors are so glaring that no one can seriously read this and not realize that it is a sensational, and not an entirely historically accurate, biography.I don't doubt the ultimate conclusion (Mao was among the most evil characters of the 20th century), but I'm afraid Chang's sensationalism will only lead to a backlash of people defending Mao. All the same, I really enjoyed this book."
1,Don't bother,"As a work of history this book is terrible. As a work of dubious fictional value, I guess it'll do. The author has an obvious axe to grind here and it shows thru on every page. Blanket claims are made and without any proof. Just the authors opinion. That is fine in a work without significance, but not in a historical book. I guess maybe I was expecting something from this book that it wasn't. As a serious look at Mao and communist China this book is a major disapointment."
1,Avoid at all costs,"This is one of the most overated works of history I have ever read. I have seen better written essays from a teenager. It is written in the style of a tabloid newspaper article. Jung Chang should study Max Hastings, Antony Beevor et al to see what a well written history book looks like. A far better book on Mao is ""Mao Tse-tung and the Chinese People"" by Roger Howard - check it out in preference to this. AVOID THIS BOOK AT ALL COSTS."
3,"Exhausting, terrifying.","The sheer numbers of people who die on every third page of this book are astounding. I am by no means disputing the facts as presented - in fact, I tend to believe them. However, the picture it paints of Mao is so utterly psychopathic that it either lends a whole new perspective to the art of being a world leader, or explains a great deal about the state of modern world politics."
5,A view from the inside,"Raised in China with the Chinese language and culture, Jung Chang has the ability to present a view of Mao from the inside looking out, thus giving us her unique perspective. I recommend reading Ms Chang's book with Jonathan Fenby's biography of Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek. Mr. Fenby of course being a westerner who views China from the outside looking in."
4,China's Monster,"The complete biography of Mao Tse Tung, dictator of China, who was responsible for the deaths of more than 70 million Chinese during his reign of terror."
5,A good book to read!,"This is a really good book to read, as the author dares writing about a negative image of Mao while many others have tried to manipulate a better image for him!"
3,Interesting book about a vile man,"Jung Chang makes a serious mistake, namely inserting her own bias too often in this book. Nevertheless, her points are compelling and convincing. Her form gets a one, her substance gets a five. Mao was a vile and foul person, intelligent and even brilliant, and perhaps at one time with genuine concern for people other than himself, but he became sheer evil. This book adds to his infamy.The votings on these reviews here are the most unnatural and fake aspect of Amazon, with the exception of Harriet Klausner. Watch the votes, watch how 24 hours running there are no votes, and then in an hour or two all the positive (anti-Mao) reviews get negative votes, and all the negative (pro-Mao) reviews get positive votes. When I first looked at this book the top reviewers all gave the book five stars, and had 90% positive votes. Look how that has changed. This customer review section, in many ways, is a metaphor for the PRC view of democracy."
3,Dead Star Over China,"An unremittingly negative portrayal of the Great Helmsman. No doubt much is true, but the authors often take great leaps in ascribing specific motives to Mao that can not be easily proved, one way or the other.The book provides a neat unified theory for almost all political events associated with Mao's PRC: e.g., the Long March, World War II battles, the role of Chou En-lai, the Korean and Vietnam wars, the Cultural Revolution, and Nixon's surprise trip. In many ways, too neat.It will be appreciated when a master historian, with full access to archives and prior scholarship, writes a more detached biography of Mao. I think he will still be judged supremely evil--but I am certain many of the events covered in this book will be given a more subtle and accurate description. The many millions of ordinary people who suffered and died during this hard time deserve no less."
3,moa was a scoundrel! we knew that?,"i like many other reviewers here thought this book was interesting at first, but, soon got very redundant i.e. telling how the chinese people suffered, starved, were tortured, over worked, and over taxed; how moa betrayed his friends and used everyone around him for his own purposes, including whole armies; how moa and his few cronies were living in relative luxury. one could start skimming these areas as i did and derive a good summary of how he did it. however, taking out the redundant areas the book cold be about 300 pages and not 600?"
4,Mao: The Unknown Story,"This book is well written, but it has little if any objectivity. However, it is definitely worth reading if you are a history buff with a built in propoganda filter in your brain, porpoganda to support the Taiwan ""Mafia."""
5,Mao Book,An interesting take on a controversial topic. The book was a terrific read although it did present a rather one-sided view. Book was in good condition and arrived on time.
4,Eye-opening,This book provides a clear and thorough history of the terrible reign of terror promulgated by Mao Tse Tung. I was astounded by the amazing cold hearted and vicious actions this man perpetrated on the Chinese people.
4,Absolute Thug!,"If half of the stuff in this book is true, then this is a story of an absolute thug! The book at certain points is revolting and it becomes difficult to read as atrocities are narrated. The CCP should take a page out of their masters, the old Soviet Union's CP after Stalin, and ""purge"" themselves (yet one more time) of all of Mao's legacy.The Chinese must be very resilient indeed to have come this far in this post-Mao era."
1,A history on Mars,"If you are familiar with the history of China in the 20th century, you will find that Mrs. Zhang is telling a story on Mars, not on the earth. Many so-called 'facts' in this book are simply faked by the authors or just from hearsay. Some are even jokes, e.g. the astonishing claim that KMT General Hu is actually a communist spy! The authors reach this surprising conclusion without any solid evidence (most of the proofs therein are without any reference).Therefore, the only comment I can make on this book is that it is about a history in the authors' mind (or on Mars), not in China, Earth. It is targeted at attacking Mao, not discovering the history. Anyway, it is not bad to regard it as a collection of jokes."
1,The story I read from the book is not true,"I read the book quickly. Unfortunately, my impression is that the authors did not tell us the truth. I cannot conclude that she/he lied completely. But, at least, the authors misled readers like you and me too much. I understand that Ms. Zhang's hatred toward Mao, her father died during Mao's culture revolution period. But if you are writing a book, you should be serious about the truth of history, you should not fabricate histroy due to your hatre. Am I right?"
1,I hate Mao,"I hate Mao, would have been a more appropriate title for this book, as it is obvious that Jung Chang does. While everyone is entitled to their own opinions, it should be presented as such, rather than in a book that is meant to rewrite history. Jung Chang tends to simplisticly interpret specific actions of Mao, without placing them in the wider context of the disarray that existed in China. The reader cannot help but feel that Jung Chang is forcing her subjectivity onto the reader. Any profound revelations of Mao is lost in this poorly written book."
1,what a joke!,"The newest tome of bathroom entertainment. ""Entertainment"" is what this is. you know when movies are ""based on true events""? this book is like that. I don't blame the authors for trying to make a couple of dollars by sensationalize and distort history to their liking. no one can really say their version of history is 100% accurate, but this is almost cartoonish in nature. I just hope some poor person don't actually believes any of this non-sense.So read this book for fun, but please don't take it seriously, and god forbid please do not bring anything up from this in a discussion with your friends or family who are knowledgeable in Chinese history. You will be laughed right out of the room."
2,I'm sorry I wanted objectivity!,"Thesis: ""Nothing anything Mao ever did was any good!""Evidence: Everything bad Mao ever didCoutner-Evidence: None!Conclusion: Mao bad, fire good!A biography by someone who does not like Mao is far more refreshing than one by someone who drank the Kool-Aid.Yet this book presents the thesis that Mao was after one thing - Personal Power. Neither Jung nor Halliday explain why this man gave up all his power in the KMT to lead a peasant revolution, if he only sought power.If you think Mao was a great man who led a great revolution that did nothing but help the Chinese people - read this book.If you wish to find an objective telling of Mao's life - read Philip Short's ""Mao: A Life"""
2,A Vendetta,"One shouldn't doubt that Jung Chang has reason to despise Mao, having lived through the effects of his reign. Mao himself certainly left plenty of evidence of his tyranny. The problem is that the vendetta is so obvious that it reaches self-parody after a couple hundred pages. The authors purport to know Mao's actual thoughts at specific times, suggest that he deserves the blame (if that's the proper word) for Stalin's death, and take an obvious relish in describing Mao's incompetence regarding such as language acquisition and management. Don't base all of your knowledge of the subject on this single source."
3,Thorough yet highly subjective.........,"I just finished reading Mao: ""The Unknown Story"" and think that the author definitley got her point across at portraying Mao for more or less who he was. The problem that I had with this book is the same problem more eloquently expressed in other reviews is its high level of subjectivity to the point of reading like a long drawn out tabloid creating some skepicism surounding the facts. Unlike another reviewer who stated that this book was tough to get through because it was ""overly simplistic"" I felt that it was easy to get through for that very reason. It needs to be pointed out that whoever was responsible for editing made some very obvious grammatical errors which should be corrected if this book ever gets reprinted.Mao: ""The Unknown Story"" would make a good supplement for other more objective biographies written about this enigma called Mao but should not be taken literally as an all conclusive definitive."
3,Good read but objectivity questioned,"Chang's version of Mao held the reader's attention but proved to lack objectivity that made one question the research put into the book. At times repetitive as if the author's didn't quite believe anyone really read the previous chapters. It is still unclear how Mao was never successfully overthrown with all the enemies he made through persecution, denunciations and torture. How and why did the Russians tolerate him? The book left many items unanswered. It was well established that Mao was a demonizing, tyrannical despot but what would have been more interesting is an anaylsis into what was the driving force behind it all. It is amazing that after what the Chinese population has been through and the void of education and culture during the Mao years they have progressed and have emerged as such a ""Superpower"". Mao's quest has been fulfilled."
2,Historically Inaccurate!,"I hoped that Amazon.com would have exercised a little caution in writing a review for this Biography. Yes, it's a sexy looking book with a sexy cover, and fun to read. However, it's largely HISTORICALLY INACCURATE, especially the bit about Chiang Kai-shek letting the Communists go during the long retreat. Many of the facts that Jung presents the reader with are disputed by many Chinese historians. Round-table discussions have been held at a few historical conferences to focus mainly on the validity of facts that Jung uses. If you're looking for a fun and interesting read that may or not be a load of inaccurate dung, read this book. If you are more inclined towards a historically accurate book, I would suggest Jonathan Spence's ""Mao Zedong""."
2,Relentlessly Brutal,"If a picture is truly worth 1,000 words, Jung Chang could have drawn a crisper portrait and spared us the repetitive and monotonous diatribe that stretches over 600 pages. This depressing narrative is peppered with painstaking details on each solitary injury, strategic blunder and character foible of Mao over his long and lethal lifetime. As insightful and illustrative as all this might be, she could have chosen a few select examples and still made her points about what a savage, conscienceless thug he was.The best chapters are those that depict Mao's scheming interactions with fascinating world-stage characters ranging from Stalin and Khrushchev to Kissinger and Nixon. The entertaining anecdotes about his personal habits and odd scatological humour add colour and lighten the dismal recounting of the fate of the mind-numbing millions who suffered under Mao. But, overall, the experience of reading this lengthy tome can be as relentlessly brutal as Mao himself."
2,The Big Green Book,"This poorly written book presents Mao as a ruthless imbecile who became the monstrous ruler of around one billion people. Ruthless and monstrous he may have been, but how an imbecile could have achieved this is beyond me.That Mao was rather a bad man is not really news. One redeeming feature of Jung Chang's book is that it might lead readers to better, and less vitriolic accounts of this great tyrants life. There are many better books on the subject. Ross Terrill's biographies of Mao, and his wife Jiang Qing, ""The White Boned Demon"" are both quite good. Also highly recommended are ""Life and Death in Shanghai"" by Nien Cheng, and ""The Private Life of Chairman Mao"", by Li Zhi-Sui.Whether or not any of these books will have a lasting or positive effect upon humanity is highly unlikely as I think there will always be populations subject to rule of despots. It's the nature of life. It has always happened, and is happening right now in many parts of the world."
3,"Interesting, yet annoying","It is a very controversial book. I found tons of discussions on the web and wikipedia, but decided to read and decide for myself.No doubt it is not objective, trying to prove in every phrase and page that Mao ""was bad"".I expected to read a story, some history and decide for myself. What I found in the book was a bit annoying. I'd like to discover and decide, not to be led to one obvious conclusion (Yes, Mao was ""BAD"").R"
4,"Mao was a lying, murdering psychopath","I read this book when I heard George W. was reading it. I found it to be very meticulously documented and thorough. It had, perhaps, a little too much detail.I liked this book because it exposed what a hypocrit Mao was. He was supposedly trying to bring dignity to the working class Chinese through socialist policies. Yet, he couldn't have cared less about ""the people."" All he wanted was to be in charge and if you trifled with him he had you and your family killed. Wow, what a great person to hold up as the father of your country."
2,most likely true but unreadable,"A grindingly unreadable biography. I started to lose interest when the authors kept writing sentences such as: ""Lo Pu told Po Lu to go to see Ko Lu and settle accounts."" Yes, go on with it then! Also: ""Zhong Zhuzing (who we shall now refer to as ZZZ)..."" Then why not also ""refer"" to Mao as MTT throughout? The sections describing Mao's infidelity are interesting and the people come alive, but otherwise the actions and individuals remain (to me) remote and mechanical.The authors fail to provide much of a context for all this running around and slaying and betrayal.Illuminates the relationship between China and Russia pretty well."
1,Don't worry about china,"Mao is not what his western sympathizers or detractors paint him to be. Unless you are chinese, (or one of China's many victims) this subject doesn't concern you. Though your idle mind thirsts for knowledge I recomend that you seek libation elsewhere my feathered friend."
3,Moan,"I must say that I was eager to begin reading this widely appreciated biography. Unfortunately, I was turned off by Mao's self indulgent character. Perhaps one day I will pick it up again, but I didn't want to waste a day of my summer vacation by reading about someone I wouldn't care to meet."
4,a very detailed account,"This is a VERY detailed account of Mao's life and I give credit to the author for the research that went into this book. Anyone would be hard pressed to match that in a book in comparison. The 'outing' of Mao's atrocities are ghastly revealing and the power of mind control over his people is the worst revelation. The first 100 pages of this book are hard to get thru. I felt it lumbered a bit but after Mao is in charge, the flow is smoother and the description of Mao's relationships with Stalin and other world leaders is priceless."
5,Wonderful piece of equipment,"This unit has a wonderful sound! I power Sonus Faber Concerto speakers with it, and boy, the sound is warm, but not too much so. The power is there when you need it for those sudden, loud passages. I can't afford a real high end amplifier. But my Denon gives me the sound I was looking for! I just love it."
4,Tube sound from solid state?,"Sold my Jolida JD-801A tube amplifier, got the Denon PMA2000IVR as a'loaner' from my local dealer. The surprising thing is that after about 100 hours of use, I really like the detail and solid bass control this amplifier has. On my Dali Mentor 6 speakers, the sound is really quite good. Who say's U can't teach an old dog new tricks. If music is a passion for you, and price a consideration, I highly recommend it!!"
2,small map,"This map is good for looking where one country is in relation to another, and locating where major cities in Europe are in relation to eachother. My complaints are that it flips right to left, rather than top to bottom which seems more natural since it is printed front and back with the continent split horizontally, and there is no way to view the entire continent on this map at once. Secondly, it doesn't make sense that this is printed as such a glossy durable map, like one that you would use frequently on the road, or in the streets, because this map won't do you much if any good during your travels. It is better suited for use in a history or geography class."
3,Classic Of Its Time.,"Difficult to know what to rate this film. Next to bonafide classics such as ""Casablanca"", it would score one star but as a camp classic it would score five stars like ""Valley Of The Dolls"". The film captures the the hedonistic lifestyle of silly, privileged, amoral Londoners in the 1970s and their interaction via a nightclub called ""Hobo"" owned by the Joan Collins character (at her glamorous peek) and her husband. The characters could be given more dimension as they are quite two dimensional. The disco soundtrack is more than adequate and the erotic sequences are quite acceptable. Film vacillates between being corny, flashy, cheeky and humorous. Worth checking out as a document of its time, the film is entertaining and enjoyable."
3,The Title Says It All...,"This DVD is truly only for the Joan Collins enthusiasts. The movie itself was reallylow quality and if not for a few interesting turns here and there would not have beenworth watching at all. Also, it was extremely short on time. If you are a Joan Collinsfan, well then, OK... but otherwise... pass on this one."
3,"""Cougar"" Before It Was Cool","Joan Collins plays Joan Collins in everthing she does, from Alexis Carrington in the 1980s night time soap `Dynasty,' to her short run as queen bee Alexandra Spaulding on CBS's defunct `Guiding Light.' In 1978, she was the original rich cougar in The Stud, based on her sister Jackie Collin's novel of the same name. Collins plays Fontaine Khaled, the London wife of a wealthy but boring businessman. She spends his money on her night club and partying. She hires a very young manager, Tony, to run her club, but his real job is satisfying her sexual demands. At the end of the film she is divorced by her husband for cheating on him. Though the overall film pretty bad and very dated (the clothes, the music, etc.), watching Collins use her boy toy for sex is exhilarating.What makes it hot: Collins was `cougar' before cougar was cool.Memorable scene: Several, including Collins' sex scene with her young stud muffin in the elevator.Memorable line: ""Well... that was nice."""
3,Joan Collins The Studess,"At the time of its release, this movie was considered very risque, avante garde and erotic, but by todays standards it's obviously quite tame. The title is cleverly misleading, because, like all predictable story lines of this nature, ""The Stud"" may have slightly more moral fibre than the rest of the characters. And, like many story lines this one starts out with zest and quickly turns sour. What makes this movie outstanding to watch today, is its Disco era music and imagery. If you love this era, its music, beats, lights and clothing, it's a must see."
1,Not meet my expectation,"I was very disappointed with everything even thou I did not send it back cuz it was too much hassle to send it back. It was already used and found spider with web in it. Oh please..The box was worn out, seems from getting wet and apparently saved in the garage for years. It did not the same as the picture shown. I strongly don't recommend anyone to buy any product from this company."
3,Rare Algal Oil DHA best for Prenatal Nutrition,"I bought this as a prenatal supplement. I wanted a 200mg dose because that's what is recommended and I didn't want to take multiple pills each day. I also chose Neuromins because it's derived from algal oil rather than fish oils. They seem expensive, but aren't when compared to similar products (OptiNate, Promise, etc). I have not tried other products, but I'm only giving this product 3 stars because the round capsule does not go down smoothly and I have algae burps if I take the pill during the day and some queasiness if I take it at night."
1,Misrepresented type of DHA,"I've purchased this product from various vendors, but usually their photos or descriptions match the product. This did not. The photo does not reflect this is the vegetarian type of DHA verses the fish based. Ocean based is usually more costly, so I believe they did this to misrepresent the deal to draw the buyer to buy what they think is a good price for the fish based version, then the vegetarian type shows up."
1,DHA Vegetarian Formula Mistake,"I have ordered Neuromins DHA 200mg many times in the past from Amazon since I give it in large doses to my 87 year old mom. The past two times I ordered it, Amazon sent me a special vegetarian formula that doesn't use fish (even though this is fish oil) - this is not what I wanted and it is not what was advertised on the site. So be careful if you are ordering this - you may get the vegetarian formula even though the description and photo online do not say anywhere that this is a vegetarian formula. On the positive side, Amazon has great customer service and I got a complete refund for this mistake."
2,Double Dog Leash,This product is just ok. The handle is very uncomfortable and too weak/flimsy for walking two dogs. I've used it 3 times and don't enjoy it.
4,kick butt kicks your butt,"I just recently purchased this video through Amazon.com, which by the way is excellent in service. I thought the video was above average. I really loved the feel of the boxing rink and enjoyed all the participants. Badrino is adorable, so you overlook his mistakes. Kristoff does a good job and puts alot into the look and feel of the video. Jackie is great to follow and very pleasing to the eyes. Overall I really liked this video and plan to purchase kick butt 11."
3,OK but not as good as expected,"I've always played sports (soccer & squash), at least I did until a knee-injury about a year ago. I bought this video on the strength of the other reviews on this page, and despite the woeful title. I was expecting a tough workout.Badrino, the trainer, is a pleasant enough guy, and looks the part. The other contributors and the music just get in the way. I did sweat but, sorry, it's not enough of a workout for the time spent.Rev it up just a bit and maybe they'd have something."
4,"High energy, motivational and complete body workout.","Bndrino combines great moves and high energy to create a workout that you look forward to, even at 5:00 AM. Some complicated moves could use better explanation."
4,Good for a quick all-around workout,"I saw this video at Wal-Mart. It was about $10, so I decided to buy it. It's not too bad. It's good for a quick workout: there's stretching, boxing, kicking, basic moves, weights, ab workout, and cooldown. I give it 4 stars because of Jackie; she didn't contribute much to this video."
3,"Easy to follow, Almost Immediate Results","I bought this tape along with two other dance workout tapes but the dance tapes left me feeling confused...too complicated. This tape is fun, easy to follow, and just the right length. One word of caution: Give it 3-4 chances before you let the mid section of the Cardio segment get you down...it's a bit confusing. The music is okay the first or second time around, but I turn down the volume and turn up a fun CD...anything that will make it more enjoyable!! You don't need to hear any instructions...Just WATCH and Learn. I can feel a difference in muscle tone after each workout--it KICKS BUTT. -SLR"
4,VERY INTERESTING,"This book will introduce you to the political side of the music industry while exposing you to the formulas for success that many major record labels use. It is NOT an easy read. The author's writing style is very clinical and at times, not very reader friendly. But if you are starting a label that you want to compete with the most successful ones, this book will provide you with some eye opening information about the processes used."
4,It's a keeper,"After taking a class based off this book, I have kept this for over four years and counting. It is well written, easy to follow, and very thorough. While at times it can be a bit dry, this book gives a great source of reference to beliefs and traditions from early Christianity up an to modern day practice."
5,Bonus with this CD.,"This CD has my favorite songs and a couple I never heard before. I love listening to this whenever I need a Selena ""fix"", which is quite often. Plus, there was an unexpected bonus; when I pulled the label out of the case, it unfolded into a very nice 9.5"" x 14"" poster of the front cover photo of her. This is beautiful!! It exhibits the perfection of Selena's figure in a very classy pose which also shows the graceful style of her dance moves. I have never before seen anyone who could move around as much as she did and any and every photo taken of her was good, never a bad view."
1,Wrong Adapter,They sent me the wrong item for the mini cassette. I have tried to contact seller and ask for the correct item or a refund. I have not heard back from them - ever. Can you help me?
3,Could've been shorter,"The book exhausts it self on Tal's journey in India, lack of in depth explanation about baba's life, eg. More discussion is needed about ""miracles"" that baba perform, his teachings and the contradiction of his teaching and Christian teachings.With about 400 pages to read, Tal focuses too much on his daily life in India and it sounds pedantic and unnecessary most of the time.The book could have been shorten into half (more than a half even better).Otherwise, Good to know that baba is a false god."
5,Awesome Book!,Amazing Book - well written and comprehensive about the spiritual war going on behind the scenes of this World. Bottom line - There is one God and His Son is Jesus Christ - everything else is a lie created by fallen angels.
1,Fiction presented as facts - A Character Assassination,"The book is a one-sided, misleading, malicious, biased, prejudiced, fictional, character-assassinating attempt of one who is actually helping the humanity. Tal Brooke's account is a revenge because of him being admonished for indiscipline in the Ashram. His attempt to tarnish the image of such a spiritual leader is indeed a sacrilege. What is mentioned as truth is actually a lie. Many of the events mentioned by the author are also not true. He has carefully camouflaged fiction with facts. Though he is careful in his language, he does achieve his purpose. His purpose is to tarnish the image of Sathya Sai Baba. Readers who have never before seen Baba, are bound to be misled. The author has the clear intent of Character Assassination. This is a book written with a good language and style but with a bad intent.The readers of this book better be forewarned that the content is actually fiction and lies disguised as facts."
1,HORRIBLY WRITTEN!,"It amazes me that someone can actually find this book to be ""exceptional"" because Tal Brooke is a hippie! I think that this book is based on one of Tal Brooke's LSD trips. Tal....please do your research.......you are only embarassing yourself! To the rest of the readers, please read Sai Literature, you will quickly find that Tal's book is based purely on his LSD trips!"
1,The Spiritual Counterfeit: isTal Brooke,"Tal Brooke attempts to smash the ocean, to shoot the sun. Like many Western animal-eaters, Tal had an addiction to animal flesh which contains trioxypurine, uric acid, more addictive than caffeine, dioxypurine. He was not able to maintain the vegetarian diet of Hindus and true Christians (Genesis 1: 29, Genesis 1: 12, Daniel 1, Isaiah 65, Isaiah 1, Revelation's 5th angel, Jesus' command to feed the hungry. Jesus: ye are whited sepulchres (literally in the Greek, sarcophagi, flesh eaters (sarx flesh phagus eat). When Tal Brooke was in the Georgetown cafeteria he said to a woman with a vegetarian tray ""You're not still into that nonsense are you?"" The Texas cattle industry, the Iowa pork industry, the Arkansas poultry industry, the Massachusetts and Maryland seafood industries, the primate research establishment.. are all threatened by the advance of dietary nonviolence."
1,Look nice...until you begin to use them,"I echo the sentiments of the first reviewer. They look really nice until you use them and begin to wash them. The paint flakes off in huge pieces and I'm not even talking about washing them with force or anything. The glasses themselves are just fine (thin, but you;d expect that out of a decorative iced tea glass or wine glass), but I wouldnt expect to get a whole lot of use out of these before noticable issues occur with the paint."
4,OK so it's not historically correct,"I know Hollywood didn't get it quite right, but in the hands of this cast, I don't care. I adore Ida Lupino and am happy to have this movie. And I love the Korngold score!"
4,good but need some major breaking in,I usually use the Gibson Gear Vintage Reissue strings on all my electrics but decided to try something new this time on my Les Paul. Overall I love the change but at first I was not happy. It took some major break in time before these came into their own. They definitely have a brighter sound and sharper attack then the Vintage Reissue and I would recommend for lead playing. As I am mostly rhythm playing I will be sticking with the great sounding and balanced Vintage Reissues.
5,Saturday Night Live-Richard Pryor,"This is a classic! I loved that episode back in the day,never seen a rerun and I still thinks its the funniest episode. So glad, that I found it on Amazon. Its on VHS but plays great. Would be nice if it was on DVD."
4,Joe Rocks Again!,"Heaven in High Gear is a true sequel to God on A Harley...Joe is back, guiding the young woman he saw in the bar with Christine at the end of ""God""...True to his word, he teaches her the guidlines that will change and enpower her life for the better...Great read, never pounding you over the head with scripture, yet getting the point across fully."
1,Very disappointing,"I was a HUGE fan of ""God on a Harley"" - and so when I saw another title by Joan Brady, I scooped it up with much enthusiasm. However, that enthusiasm was quickly dashed when I realized this was simply a remake of the same story. But drawn out. Boring, and disappointing!"
3,Engaging and Uplifting,"Heaven in High Gear is not a book for people into serious theology. However, Ms. Brady does a good job of getting across the idea that God/Jesus is much more interested in us than in what we do or don't do. This is an easy-to-read book (I finished it in 2 evenings). Pick it up for a friend who needs a spiritual lift."
1,Battery not reliable,"Not very happy with this product! We bought this battery to replace the original Sharp BT-H32U battery as we wanted to use the camcorder during our overseas trip. It seemed to charge OK but once we started using the camcorder in Australia (where it was winter) it started functioning strangely.At times it would show flat battery, then show full and at times switch itself off. Often the charge would not last very long at all compared to the original battery. As a result of doing one or more of these functions in quick succession, it jammed the tape in the camera and nearly lost us all the video we had taken. Luckily I managed to remove the tape without breaking it, but from that time we used the camera sparingly and did not switch it on/off too often when we did use it.Overall, I do not believe it is too much to ask that something as simple as a camcorder battery be reliable - which this one was not."
1,You can't rate a product in the negatives but this one is.,"I was thrilled.The battery arrived today. The only problem is it is junk, therefore this co can't have quality control. Never again. Cheapest price is not an issue when it does not function. I believe I could have found a better one in a dumpster."
2,OUTDATED!,"I personally only purchased this book because it was required for a class - it uses a 3.5"" floppy disk as a companion. The forms are old and the book is not the greatest to follow as you have to keep looking in other areas of the book to get details and formatting.. Time for a new edition!"
3,Basic Nunchaku Vol 2,"This book should be a follow up of Demura first book. This book still covers basics, which it does well. I would recommend this as a basic or intermediate book."
4,Fun read,This book is great for beginners who are studying nunchaku with an instructor and wish to suppliment their knowledge. The diagrams and descriptions are clear and easy to follow.
4,Good book if you need to educate your company,"I read and highlighted this book with the promise of my manager to read it after me (or at least the highlighting!). I am hoping the book will move up the management structure and make a difference. I believe the book is somewhat remedial if you have been in the usability world for very long, but if you are trying to influence an organization and educate them as to the value, methodology and how-to of usability, this book will help."
2,Gallagher: Smashing Cheeseheads,"If Gallagher could only realize that America fell in love with him for his cleanliness, his humorous stories about his daughter Amy, and his ability to tell it like it is. We miss his one-of-a-kind inventions, his mockery of the English language, and his hillarious props used on stage.We are now given a bitter old man with a chip on his shoulder that he can't seem to shake. We are told he is the ""new"" Gallagher and that his ""new"" jokes are suppose to be funny to us. They're not. If I wanted dirty and rude, there is an unlimited supply of comedians to choose from. If I want clean and fun, all that's left is Bill Cosby.I'll miss you Gallagher but I'll always have the memories of your past perfomances and I will forever cherish them!"
1,Not what i expected,"I expected color illustrations, and they are black line drawings. However, they are beautiful, it's just color would have been much better."
1,Impossible to wash,"I bought these because they were so pretty and matched the colors in my Fiesta Ware. However, the painted flowers come off at the gentlelist touch when wet, even if they are only wet from condensation of a beverage! I never use them because I can't wash them without the flowers coming off. What a disappointment. I will not ever buy another Block product."
5,Beanie Politics,"They aren't ""toys"" to me....but they make the perfect gag gift for any couple that are registered as a Democrat AND a Republican voter. I received the Beanies in good time and all were in fine shape."
5,History of Saudi Arabia,Very interesting book concerning the history of Saudi Arabia before World War II. Very informative about the life in this part of the world. Indispensable for any in depth study of the history of the Arab world. Very interesting photos.
5,Engaging for Children and Adults,"I bought this book for my four-year-old for Christmas. She loves it dearly. She loves the frightening imagery and bravery written in the poem and also the jagged, strange paintings that were chosen to illustrate them.I am not a big fan of Angelou's poetry but this poem is very relevant for most children and it has a lovely repetitive quality. It's also a good candidate for memorization. I would recommend this for any child or adult."
4,my favorite bedtime story.,"the images are crisp and clear. the book is a bit thin, but very sweet. i keep it on my nightstand to remind me that life indeed doesn't frighten me. i can't wait to have a kid to share this with."
2,Undecided,"The pictures are abstract looking and dark in tone. The book makes reference to; ghosts, bad men fighting in the dark, and cougars in the park. I'm not sure my 3 or 5 year old children had thought up these bad things on their own yet. While reading them the book I felt uneasy about the dark pictures and scary references to things they may not have even thought of before. I'm still undecided if it will be helpful in convincing them that they don't need to be afraid of life or if it will convince them that life is pretty scary and they ought to be afraid! There is one reference to 'having a lucky charm up her sleeve' that protects her from the bad stuff and also allows her to walk on the ocean floor without having to come up to breathe. Those are both useless defenses in the real world so the book doesn't offer any real reasons to not be scared of life."
4,Love Maya Angelou!,"I absolutely love the message presented in this book. Maya Angelou writes beautifully and I was excited to see a children's book by her so that my young son could enjoy her as well. My only complaint is that the art is a bit dark an bleak, but it fits in the context of this story."
3,"Echo Bridge fixes past errors, creates new ones with this double feature","Here's the rundown on this disc:Single layer BD25 Blu-ray disc. Both films are on the same disc.

4,Orbital Montion,"little21th January 2012.I'm satified with your service.Thank you (I'm sorry, I'm not a good writer, so I write just"
4,Urban Fantasy at its best,"This is an extraordinary first book in a series. It's a complicated world to describe while keeping the action spinning. Cassie Palmer is a compelling character, wise beyond her age and amazingly intuitive, probably as a result of the environment in which she was raised. While there were segments of the story that lagged when background information was provided, the book didn't waste too much time and would quickly resume the action.My head was spinning trying to keep track of the obvious villains and those who might be. Nothing was ever as clear as it might seem and I had to keep my wits about me to keep up. I'm normally frustrated with a heroine like Cassie who might make silly decisions in the midst of all the chaos but she's formidable. Cassie is quick-witted, funny and talented. And, she's not intimidated by any of the power around her.I'm a fan of the series and am looking forward to the next book."
3,Super Reader,"Not too bad. A girl grows up with vampires, and the vampire mafia no less, and eventually grows up enough to find out why all these supernatural types are interested in her more than any other run of the mill can actually do some fortune telling clairvoyant.Good mages, bad mages, good fairies, bad fairies, vampires, wererats, satyrs, or whatever. It seems she is in line to be the uberoracle, and controlling her or having her on your side would be helpful. Especially as she she can do the slice, dice and slay pretty well now, too."
3,Shows promise,"I loved the story plot and the unique characterization. The story is a little rough around the edges, but am looking forward to the authors development as well as Cassandra Palmer's -"
3,Promising,"Obviously there were plenty of readers who liked this book and are breathlessly awaiting the sequel - so perhaps you will be one of those readers instead of the minimal percentage like me, who found this book promising but not quite there yet. One of my main problems is that the author took a lot of time talking and explaining - something that oddly reminds me of the later Anita Blake books, where they do the exact same thing (but to a more annoying degree). I ended up skipping a lot of parts, preferring to get back to the story. Another problem was that I had already fallen for Tomas, and was ready for Cassie to be with him. The author hasn't convinced me enough yet to let go of Tomas. And some things that Cassie did made me go ""Huh?"" Anyway, it started off promising enough and has plenty of potential. If you're unsure about this, then perhaps borrow it from the library instead of buying."
3,Too Much Set-Up,"I read this book because it was recommended by Amazon and the premise seemed interesting. Unfortunately, I didn't really like it. The author took entirely too much time setting things up and providing boring background information. I found all of the myriads of characters to be distracting and hard to follow. I also could not relate to the heroine Cassie. I thought she was boring and annoying. I saw the potential in this book, but it was never realized. A much better read is ""Moon Called"" by Patricia Briggs."
2,Not a very good book,"I was disappointed by this book, I wasn't able to connect with the characters in the book, it was kind of all over the place, just not well written."
2,I really wanted to like it!,Yikes. I really wanted to like this book because it sounded like a really interesting premise and such a different idea than most of the paranormal romances. I found myself reading and rereading certain parts just to try to figure out exactly what was going on. I was more than halfway through the book when I realized I still didn't know why she was taken - then I decided that I really didn't care anymore. I was also hoping there would be some romance instead of these strange convoluted interludes. Disappointing.
1,I don't even know..,"One of the worst books I have read. I have hundreds of books, I'm very open to reading different things. Love Sci-fi!!! But this one? BORING! I dont even know whats going on half the time! I got to page 200 and still had no idea what was going on. I thought I just accidently picked up book 2 or 3 in the series, because for a first book, it is very confusing. They go into history a little, but the description of the past is vague. Too fast paced. Things need to slow down and go into more conversation and backround. I usually read books of this size in one day. It took me five to get through it because it did not capture my attention, mostly because i just didnt know what was going on!! Keep your money"
2,Better choices out there,This book is has way too much going on in it. The multiple story lines and choppy transitions make it an unenjoyable read. I felt as if the story just did not flow! I picked this book because it was the first in a vampire/paranormal series. I enjoy reading series. I will not be buying the second book in this series! It is all I can do to get through this one. I am still in process of reading it and it taking me much too long. I would highly recommend the Sookie Stackhouse series by Charlaine Harris if you enjoy Vampire/Paranormal with much more character depth and story line. I'll just have to keep looking for another good series.
3,Has Potential,"This book could have been good. Instead, the author spends far too much time in back-story or taking far too long to explain every little thing. As a result, the book is slowed to a crawl.After many years of living in a compound full of vampire criminals Cassie has escaped. She lives for three years in relative obscurity before the vampire council finds her.Cassie has issues, she wants answers, she wants revenge. When I started this book I wanted answers, too. But the story was so convoluted and took such a slow lazy route getting there, I finally just lost interest.As my title indicates, this book does have potential. Hopefully the next one will have settled down a little and I won't have to read through anecdotes and overly descriptive sections to get to the meat of the story. And, oh yes, I will read her next one because this could become a really good series once the author gets her *sea legs*."
4,a bit weary,"When I first started reading ""Touch the Dark""(by karen chance) it seemed to me that there should be a book before this to explain everything. When my search for this book came up non-existent, I became very weary of reading the rest of this book. This book takes you on a magical tour through the time of the decades and I thoroughly enjoyed it. My Second dilema came after finishing the book. The end left me hanging. The book, as I feel, should retain a sequel. Overall I give this book 4 stars for all of the twists, turns and the climax of the story. :)"
1,Don't bother,Don't waste your time on this book. Little character development and no plot line to speak of.
5,fantastic,"Cassie is special, she has special powers that relates to seeing ghosts and whatnot, she can see the future as well. This makes her somewhat of an attraction to a certain vamp, but after a series of misfortunate events, her life becomes in danger and it will take more help than she thought to get out of it alive."
3,Mildly entertaining,"Too much action, not enough story. I felt like there was a book before it that I haven't read because right away it awkwardly plunges you in to the middle of an action scene."
4,Good Read,This is a great start to a new series for me. This is my first book by Karen Chance and I can't wait to get the second one. Hope the series continues with the non-stop action.
4,FRESH ANGLE ON PARANORMAL...,"I really liked the premise, not your typical vampire story. I like it when there are lots of other mythical creatures to a story (not just in the background)that the author can use to take the story in any number of directions. It keeps the read unpredictable. I like the authors style, with the exception of her tendency to info dump. I'm sure it will be relevant information in the future, but does it have to come in the middle of a life or death scenario, or a hot love scene?"
5,Can't wait to read the next one!,"This is the first Karen Chance book I've ever read, and I have already ordered the second book in this series. This book had me entranced from the beginning. I can't wait to continue it and see what happens to Cassie next! I think anyone who likes vampires and the paranormal will love this book!"
3,interesting plot but plodding writing,"*sigh*The first chapters of this debut were smart and smartly written. Chance offers some nice twists on the urban genre, but about a quarter in the writing gets seriously bogged down. And the interesting characters that Chance has drawn together seem churlish, with dialogue along the lines of Valley Guy vamps preening for Cass's attention. I'm hoping Chance pulls it together, since the ideas are compelling enough for me to venture into sequel territory. But pages and pages of description punctuated by minimal and simplistic dialogue won't save even the cleverest of novel urban heroines."
4,Slow start,"The book started so slow and confusing (for book 1 of a series, not good) I put it down but eventually picked it back up and I'm glad I did. After a while the author found her pace and by the second book the world she created became intruiging and worth reading, but I had to stick with it to get the literary pay off."
2,Over enthusiastic author bogs down w/ too much plot,"I wish that the author has shown a bit--okay a lot--more restraint inthe plotting of this book. As it is, there is so much going on inthis book that is hard to take in. In this first book alone, there ismore than enough plot for an entire series.Not that the story or the supernatural world that Cassandra lives inisn't interesting, quite the opposite. But as a reader, I din't getto enjoy it very much because I was constantly being crammed withplot, plot, and more plot (except for the abrupt and extremelygraphic--and long-- sex scene that seemed very out of place given thetone of the rest of the book).I would have liked to become more slowly immersed into the worldrather then getting thrown in and never being allowed to come up forair. I would have read the rest of the series if the former had beentrue rather then the latter, assuming that the graphic sex scenehadn't been included. Oh well."
2,had potential,"This story had a lot of potential, but it fell short in many ways. One it jumped around a lot. And then some of the action scenes I had to reread a couple of times to get just what was going on. For some reason the story just did not flow right. I read many books, a lot I check out from the library, buy or get from my book club and this was one I had picked up to add to my collection based on reviews. I hate to say it, but I was disappointed in this book. If you are looking for urban fantasy pick up Charlaine Harris, Sookie series, or the new one from Patricia Briggs, Moon Called, or the Rachel Morgan series by Kim Harrison, or even the Weather Warden series from Rachel Caine, There are so many in this genre, this book wasn't the worst but it fell short of where it could have gone."
2,Yawn...,"Confusing and virtually plotless. The author would jump from present to past all the time, and normally I wouldn't mind, but she does it during fight scenes. It gets confusing when one minute everyone's in a fight for their lives, the next the main character is lost in her own thoughts about the past for pages after pages. When I was half way through the book, I realized nothing's happened yet. It had all been about Cassandra's ramblings of the past. Yawn."
2,"Great Ideas, Poor Execution","This book had so much potential - the alternate reality that Karen Chance has created is new and refreshing and could be very interesting to read about, which is why I gave it two stars instead of one. I thought the quality of the writing was absolutely dreadful - Chance just couldn't translate the story on paper. They way Chance bounced around between subjects was confusing at best. The typos were horrendous and sometimes the dialogue just didn't make sense. Chance also tried to jam pack too much information in this first installment when since this is a series, it would have been beneficial to reveal things in later books to keep the reader interested."
1,TMI,"When I started this book I thought it started out ok, but then the author introduced way too much information and it was somewhat distracting. It was as if she had all these great ideas and couldn't narrow it down and didn't have a clear way of putting it together the story-line. I read a review that it was very distracting when you have an action scene and then several pages of background in the middle of it. I quite agree. There was just too many different paranormal/mythical ideas in the first book. Not sure whether to blame the author, editor or publisher on this one."
1,Omg boooooring.....,"Was I the only person I found this book super boring, sometimes when an author puts a lot of details into the book it makes it so boring and that's what happened with this book.... I can't even say the story like was good because it was terrible i hate it! I mean I was super surprised people gave this book almost four stars... I usually check the reviews and I tend not to lead my judgement be believing in them... But I didn't like this book at all and I'm glad I borrowed it from my library instead of making a purchase on it because I would of been upset about it"
2,Convoluted series,"I really tried to give this book a chance. It took two tries to read and two weeks to finish. The plot is very convoluted and the chapters are way too long. I like plots like Kim Harrison's, Charlaine Harris', and Patricia Briggs', but this confused me and never became interesting. I even read the second book in the series hoping it would help me appreciate the first. However, I found the series itself, totally unappealing. I think the author could be very good tho. I will try one of her other series."
2,the main character is a vapid idiot.,"what i said. I gave it two stars b/c i like Karen Chance as an author, but otherwise....How does this idiot merit more page time than Midnight's Daughter? I don't read fantasy so I can hear about some pathetic poor namedropping idiot with a bimbo brain and gogo boots auditioning for a role in a one star bodice ripper."
3,To much yak yak yak..,I like the stories but she thinks way to much and it getting on my last nerves.I just want to find out what's going on and she go off thinking about something else before coming back to whats important then says nothing at all.. to much ramble and not enough plot. no body else gets a complete sentence in before she starts ranting..If i do stick with this series i hope other characters get a chance to narrate.
4,Cassie Palmer ghost whisperer extraordinaire,"I started off with Karen Chances Dory Basarab series. Dory is the daughter of Mircea, who plays a main role in the Cassandra Palmer series. I loved them and thought I would try this series also, but I must admit this first book didn't appeal to me the wayDeath's MistressandMidnight's Daughterdid. Maybe because Cassie is so timid and shy in the first book, whereas Dory is loud and out there. Cassie is being chased by a vamp master Tony she escaped from and the only friend she has turns out to be working for the other side, or is he? Cassie has the ability to see, talk to and channel ghosts. She also has a heritage that seems important to the vamps, except she would rather just be left alone. This is a slow start into the series, but having read the rest I know it just gets better with time, just like a mature wine. Highly recommend this writer."
4,A bit slow at first but then picks up speed quickly,"I discovered this series through Amazon's ""recommended reads"". I found my mind wandering in maybe the first third of the book. It then became extremely entertaining. I liked it enough to order the 2nd and 3rd books in the series before I got to the end of the book --- so I could start reading them immediately upon finishing this one."
2,had the potential to be good story but is very disjointed,"This could have been a good story but is more than a little difficult to follow with the pace extremely fast and the herione jumping from one situation to the next with barely a pause in between. Not to mention flashing back & forth in time. Characters go from friends to foes to friends again in rapid sequence. And then, it was over. Or was it?"
2,"Too much, too soon","There's enough setup for about six books here, which unfortunately leaves little room for an actual story. Too many players, too much yakking. I waited and waited for something to develop between the characters, but gave up about 5/6 of the way through the book, just couldn't sit through any more talking. The author has taken every supernatural element she could think of and stirred it all into a Laurell Hamilton-type soup... without the whining, which is good, but also without the sex. The whole thing reads like an over-elaborated adolescent fantasy, one of that kind where the actual fantasy never gets going because the fantasist has to get every detail of the setup right before she can begin. Maybe next time?"
1,It's like I'm herding cattle.,"TOUCH THE DARK by Karen Chance. This book would be the opposite of ANGELOLOGY (which bored me to tears). There was too much going on in TOUCH THE DARK. The author wrote in first person, which I do love. BUT she never really explained the whole paranormal world. You're thrust into it like a chicken who's lost their head. Everything is so jumbled together and confusing. You're stumbling blind. The majority of the book is spent in a room with way too much dialog explaining stuff instead of actions speaking for themselves. A big no-no in my book of pet-peeves. And the love interest/weird sex comes out of left field. Literally. There is no spark. No flirting. Just wham and bam and their clothes are off. REALLY? I mean . . . really? Right, then. Next.(It's like I'm herding cattle.)"
2,2 stars is generous!,"I can't believe how many positive reviews this book has. I don't know about the rest of Karen Clark's work, but this is just a BORE!! The main idea is sort of interesting but nothing really happens and Cassie is SO stupid. If you want to read it, make sure you borrow it from a library or a friend or pay no more than 50 cents for it. You'll regret paying full price for this snooze-fest."
1,Desperately seeking Editor,"I feel strongly for this book because I really wanted it to be a success. I made it through only because I forced myself to finish it, I hate leaving books unfinished. But it was a CHALLENGE. I still have the second book sitting unread on my shelf, I am interested in the storyline but I just wish Palmer had a better editor."
4,Touch the Dark: Cassandra Palmer,"Great series to start with if you are getting into fantasy with out the romantic babble. Not that there isn't a romantic hint. The story is strong and magically creative, though the frame work of the storyline has vampires, witches, mages, etc it's not the same old kind of wash, rinse, and repeat theme. Cassie is a great character that you can relate to and in some way really want to be inside her story. This story is funny, sexy, action packed, & attention holding. The author flows from one chapter to another sending you into a tale spin just when you think you know what's going to happen next. Karen Chance describes her characters so vividly that you can picture each face, time, clothing, and location. She can lose you in the language and the world that Cassie is trying to survive on her own terms."
1,Blah blah blah,"This book starts out all description, lots of narration and no action. Then it's a line of dialog followed by a paragraph or three of technical detail before the dialog is continued. There is no character development - I am left with no identification with any of the characters. The one character that I expected to develop - Tomas - could have been a great hero/love interest, but he just fell to pieces - scapegoat style. The main character - I can't even remember her name - made few hard decisions - everything just happens to her. She never grew, never developed into the strong ass-kicker that she could have/should have become.I have no interest in continuing the series. I have forgotten it already."
3,More of a quick 'pop' read then anything,"I'm all about vampires, witches, ghosts, and anything supernatural. This book has it and more, but what it's lacking is a strong character that you're entranced by, wanting to know what they're going to do next. Cassie is lacking in that way, more so to the point that I just wanted to scream at her to get up and DO something. It felt like K. Chance greatly watered down a vampire (hunter) series by another author and weaved a few differences in it to create her own. It didn't really work out in her favor.The sex scenes felt like they were there just to be there, the fights were boring to the point I wanted to just skip over them, and the dialog was annoying.I have the first two books only because I was given them as something to read while in the hospital. So I'll be reading Claimed by Shadow in the hopes that maybe Cassie just got off to a slow start and will pick up speed soon.We shall see."
2,...,"It was an okay book. The idea was great, but it's very involved and you feel like you're only getting a small part of the story for most of the book. The writing was good, but so much was assumed that it was very difficult to follow. But it's definately worth a read, though I won't be buying the sequels."
5,Rocking new author!,"Some new vamp fiction that isn't all about sex, but has just enough to make you sizzle. I enjoyed Chance's view on the vamp world. Lot's of twists and betrayals to keep you reading to the very end. I hope there's a sequel."
3,Sorry thought it was stupid,"Hard to believe this book was written by a woman. After the first two chapters, I thought for sure it had been written by a male, pulp fiction writer. Its a ""vampire story"" so I expected blood and guts, but this was just so over the top with its graphic depictions of various forms of torture. It made me think of those ""Saw"" movies.The concept was interesting, so I give it three stars for that alone, but I didn't like where she went with the main character. I much prefer books by Keri Arthur."
5,"Weird, wild wonderful book","This wasn't like anything I've read in the genre before, and starts a truly original series. It's hard to describe because there isn't anything else like it out there: it has some romance, but it isn't a paranormal romance book. The romance in this and the two sequels drives the plot but isn't the plot itself. It has some humor, but isn't remotely chick lit. In a tongue firmly in cheek sort of way, it plays with stereotypes, but never manages to be one. It has elements of mystery, thriller, and even horror, and somehow manages to make them all work together. I'm not sure how to describe it, but I know I really liked Touch the Dark and am very glad I found this series."
3,"A fun read, but doesn't live up to its potential.","Touch the Dark is an action packed sprint through an intriguing world of supernatural mayhem and disaster. The writing is quality and the plot interestingly convoluted, but the frenzied pace detracted greatly from the overall work. Instead of an immersive experience, the book feels like a series of overdone action scenes patched together with stilted plot exposition; it's a special effects action flick that never quite manages to entirely make sense.Karen Chance did succeed in producing a page turner that's hard to put down, but it leaves a reader wanting in the end. I'd recommend this for a light read, the literary equivalent of prime time television, but anyone looking for a serious work of fiction should steer clear. Hopefully in the future Chance will refrain from a dizzying rush of action to let her impressive style and imagination take center stage."
2,To be a Saudi,"Being a Saudi and having read the book, I found it to be excessivily utopic and somewhat out of touch. The truth of the matter is that our country has serious issues that require long-term solutions. Identifying the core issues relating to education, society, politics, religion and economy is the begining of a long hard journy to reinvent ourselves. For us to survive in the ""global"" world of today, we need to be a proactive member of the global community. Saudi Arabia will need to develop a strategy based on a vision that will ultimatly benefit the people not a vision that suits only a few members of society - We Need Leadership. We are no longer able to maintain the current pace of change, time is no longer on our side....Change is not only important it is essential."
3,Generally pretty nice,It is a comfortable boot and pretty nice looking for synthetic leather. My only complaint would be the inside zipper has sort of a long grip which sort of bounces around while I'm walking.
3,a frame story,"I enjoy the characters of Shep and Mira, but this novel was really about the Curry family. It felt as if Shep and Mira were just a frame story in which the Curry family could be portrayed. I never felt that the motivations of the different Curry family members were sufficiently explained. A prison escape is a significant part of the plot, but a reason for it is not given. A significant character is murdered, skinned actually, but that murder and the reason for it is never explained. This novel left me with a lot of questions."
3,Lolly is getting better!,"The single forever in love althought didn't get no.1 in the UK chart, but the single is good enough, with catchy sound and his distinguished voice, Lolly is back with another single! Can't wait for her next album!"
1,THIS IS A FAKE!,This is a FAKE cheap jersey. I dont know why this user can sell this on AMAZON. This product isnt a LECOK SPORTIF original product.
3,pep talk,"Throughout her book, Elshtain is letting her communitarian viewpoint shine through. She wants to revive our sense of responsibility and rid our nation of its cynicism and lack of faith in politics. Democracy to her is a civic good. It is an everyday demeanor citizens portray as they work towards improving their communities, their cities, and the nation as a whole. ""Think global, act local"" would be an accurate representation of this ideology. Elshtain is crying out to the citizen at the heart of all of us to get involved, not allow the government to worsen the problem, and show some responsibility and inform ourselves. Her book is a locker room pep talk, trying to fire up the troops for battle again."
1,Trying to finish it,This book is very hard to read. Excruciatingly painful in dull plot as well as the overly wordy text. I am going to finish it as an exercise in tenacity.
4,The Best of Faulkner,"I find it interesting so many people found this book incomprehensible. This easily the *most* comprehensible of any of Faulkner's writings. It's also the most likable, the most charming, and the only one of his books I can say I honestly enjoyed all the way through. It's not as self-conscious, artsy, or convoluted as most of his other works, and because of that very thing, I'd say it offers more depth than even his ""deep"" books. Here, we actually find a cast of primarily likable characters whose adventures are all the more engaging and funny for the fact that their very ridiculousness makes them seem possible. I'm glad I stuck with Faulkner long enough to read this one."
2,On and on.,I finally gave up. This book has no paragraphs. It just goes on and on. It would be like reading fifty books. Well written but I don't want to read on forever.
2,Disclaimer:I didn't finish,"I'm not sure I should leave a review considering I didn't finish this book, but that, to me, is the reason I'm leaving a review. This is the first and only book (out of over 100) that I just cannot make myself read. It goes on forever like an old man telling a story with no reason. I'm sure this is a great book and I've read Faulkner before, but every time I'd pick this up to get back to it, I felt like it was a chore. Reading is a hobby and not something I want to feel is an obligation. This made it feel that way, so I had to stop. Maybe I'll return to it and finish it. When/if I do I'll amend this review."
3,I am mentally incapable of enjoying this.,"I confess I am not capable of understanding or enjoying this book. I know it is just me because the world has acclaimed the author and the book. I have tried and tried and finally concede, aware of the scorn to be heaped upon me, that it makes no sense and is not entertaining.I do not pick up a book to initiate a mind numbing ordeal.I concede the author is a genius....because everybody tells me that. And I admit my total inability to connect with him or his characters."
3,Hydrangeas are finally blue,"I have read it is hard to get unpotted Hydrangeas to bloom blue or purple, this did the trick. I would not get over zealous and try to go heavier than recommended, I have had better success when I reduce the recommended dose slightly but increase the frequency to every few weeks."
4,Great Memories,"I must have been a very goofy kid, because this is a very goofy show. Over twenty years after its original airing on Nickelodeon, I still love this show. It has a sincerity that is rare for a cartoon, but it doesnt seem sappy or over done. I recommend this to any one born in the late 70's or early 80's who spent their afternoons looking at Nick. Was there a better time to be a kid than the 80's?"
4,Thank you!,"I think it's great to see these shows I enjoyed as a young child available today- keep 'em coming! I'd also really love to see ""The World of David the Gnome"" (which they already put on DVD in the U.K.), ""Noozles"" (you remember, the one with the koalas?), ""Inspector Gadget"", ""Heathcliff"", etc. Thanks!!"
4,more Beethoven meets Stokowski,These Decca recordings of Leopold Stokowski's interpretations of Beethovens 5th and 7th symphonies hold up quite well and at this price very good value for money
1,This thing sucks!!!!,"I've tried it and it worked fine for a while (and the trasnsfer rates were slower than sandisk memory devices), but then it just stopped working one day!! Tried it on my laptio and other 10 different pcs, no one recognized the stick nemore!! No physical damage, nothing happened, JUST STOPPED WORKING!! i lost all my data and wasted my money."
4,One of the best books that I won't own,"The price on this book must be so high because it is a collector's item. Published in 1958, this is a collection of cartoonist Oliver Harrington's Bootsie cartoons. The introduction was written by none other than Langston Hughes who had been a mentor to Harrington. If this book is in the public library, I will borrow it."
5,Perfect,"Its amazing how fast this little drive is. This is my first USB drive and it works flawlessly. As a computer science major, this is an ESSENTIAL tool!!!"
1,Still waiting,I havent received magazine yet or any notification as to when I will get itIt would be nice to know when i can stop buying it in store
5,Excellent magazine.,My mom loves this magazine and I ordered it for her. I enjoy reading it as well. The magazine took longer than expected to be delivered and hopefully it'll come on time every week from now on.
5,I love this magazine,"I too remember this magazine from the 1980's. Remember the commercial for it? ""Woman's world, the woman's weekly... from cover to cover we cover your world."" Well I've been seeing it at Wal-mart for years but only recently (March) started buying it. I have only missed two issues since then. I save money and learn something new with every issue. My most recent information was finding out about free shipping through amazonmom.com. I tell my husband that he really should let me subscribe to it, but I love going to Wal-mart and picking up the new issues. I love discovering which diet they will review. The one on the green tea fat flush is true as I've lost about 20 pounds since drinking the tea. I love this magazine!"
1,not yet received yet,I have yet to receive my first copy. It should be coming any day as it has almost hit the 6 week mark. Deb
5,A magazine no woman should be without,"I have been reading Woman's World magazine for about 2 years and have not missed ONE.I keep all of the magazines and refer back to different articles from time to time. I have encouraged all of my friends to purchase this terrific magazine and of course they are hooked. For the price of this magazine and the wealth of information it contains, I feel like I have saved thousands and learned so much. Keep up the great job and I would recommend WW to publish books by topics such as good health, home and family,food and nutrition etc.... LOVE THIS MAGAZINE THANKS"
2,"Great magazine, poor customer service","You get a lot for your money as far as content. Yes, there's a diet in every issue, but you can say that about most magazines targeting women. Woman's World also has a lot of helpful information on a wide variety of topics as well as very encouraging stories and articles.I don't recommended subscribing to this magazine. I got maybe half of my issues, they didn't extend my subscription the way they said they would, and my most recent requests for issues I didn't receive were ignored. Buying the magazine in the store is worth paying a little more so you don't miss an issue. I won't be renewing my subscription."
2,Would love to comment but haven't rec'd any issues yet!!!,I have not rec'd any issues of Womens World as of yet so I cannot review it. I read this magazine in a dr.'s office & it really looked interesting so I decided to order-that was in Aug. I hope I didn't make a mistake by ordering this magazine.
3,Mail Order Insufficient,I love the magazine but when I received it in the mail it was always torn. WW should put it in some kind of a cover. When I contacted customer service they never responded.
1,JUNK,Not worth anything. The item looks and feels cheap because it is made cheaply. I returned the item. Do not recommend.
5,for the baby or the parent?,i love these little things! i bought them for my 20m old daughter...and i play with almost on a daily basis!...they're almost like a hard silicone...but they're not hard...they squish..so if you step on them..its NOT going to hurt..i bought 2 boxes and they were worth every pennny!
3,Mediocre adventure story,"You can read about the storyline in the other reviews so I won't repeat it here. I found this a mediocre adventure story that disappointed slightly in three ways: the characters had no depth, there was too much gore for my taste, and there wasn't very much science fiction in it. Except for a space battle in the last 20 pages, the book could have transpired on present-day Earth. Science fiction should either be good literature or have interesting science in it, I'm fine with either, but this book has neither. If you want adventure stories about plucky junior officers, I recommend the Hornblower novels instead."
5,A far cry from his great works,"By which I mean Hammers Slammers (of course). Women! This one heads up a female role like he got married and she was all over his writing. This is definitely new ground in writing for him. But, he's the best in his field. He'll overcome his inadequacies in merging.Now for the kicker: I'd always wanted to be there when Hammer's Slammers kicked off with Hammer and Joachim and the white mice. This would be it! A deadly and talented woman as the leads (Daniel) first in command and... Joachim in a womans form, under Daniels first in command with alias' and complications. Drake is amazing where he will go and has the genius of natural talent to take it there. I subscribed to amazons e-mail notifications to catch the next novel in this series. An awesome read for THE NAVY, FAMILY HONOR, and JUSTICE.TheNIGHTCRAWLER (Has stated the obscure)"
2,Didnt like it,"I didn't care for this book for some reason. I'm not sure why, just couldn't get into it."
5,The Patrick O'Brian Analogue I've Been Looking For,"I loved Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey/Maturin novels and searched in vain for naval historical fiction -- beyond Forester -- that similarly offered solid action and excellent characters. With Drake's ""With the Lightnings"" -- although admittedly heavy-handed in its mimicry of O'Brian's work --, I've finally found a series with the same features I enjoyed in O'Brian's books.Importantly, Drake hasn't entirely copied the Aubrey/Maturin relationship or plot line. Major plot elements in Drake's novels are lifted from various time periods rather than the French/English conflict of the late 18th and early 19th centuries. The relationship between protagonists Leary and Mundy is nuanced and Mundy's career as a spy is contextualized far better than Maturin's ever was.Overall, this first novel in the series was well-written and I'd recommend to fans of Weber's Honor Harrington books, O'Brian's Aurbey/Maturin novels and Forester's Hornblower novels."
3,Quick Read,"Well, I really debated over giving this 4 stars, but I just don't think it was quite there. I am a fan of military SF and space opera so this book is right up my alley. I liked the two lead characters and found them fairly compelling. The plot was pretty standard fair in the genre, but solid and easy to follow. However, the first quarter of the book was very slow and even in the middle I found my self wanted to skim rather than read all of it. Drake needed to get the action cranked up sooner than he did. I have already ordered the second book and, therefore, like the book, but it was not as good as David Webber's Honor HArrington, David Fientuch's Midshipman's Hope, or Card's Ender's Game. I am hopeful that the future books will take it up a notch."
5,"READ,READ & ENJOY!","I liked this book,if you like adventure and excitement than read this book. Both guys and girls will want to read this book."
5,Great story,A thoroughly enjoyable story. The technical terms weren't overused but were spread out convincingly enough to enable the reader to believe they were real rather than the product of a very fertile imagination.
2,Dribble... there are much better things to read.,"This book was in the free section on Amazon and was highly rated by other readers so I figured; I'd give it a shot. Sorry, but I gave it several chapters and just couldn't get into it, so admittedly ""I did not finish this book."" The hokey names and general feel of the writing I knew it wasn't for me. I guess if I actually paid money for it I would have forced myself, but life is too short. I am currently reading and recommend the Harry Turtledove’s ”World war” series... a much better read!"
5,John Perrin,GOOD book. Highly recommend it to those who enjoy science fiction with plenty of adventure and suspense. Get it today.
3,Better than regular soap,"I have chronic dermatitus , and this soap is all natural , so it doesnt irritate. after about 2 weeks of using it , my skin got siginificantly better. Its not a cure, but it will ease up skin a bit. no chemicals in this product, its 100% all natural. its a little pricey with shipping, but it lasts for a while.i reccomend it"
1,Did not work for me,"I ordered this soap in hopes that the Neem content would be sufficient to treat some of my skin conditions. However, when I used it on my face, it made me break out in a rash and terrible acne. Do not recommend."
1,yuck,This soap smells so terrible that I had to quit using it after only the second try. I saved the bar for a while until I figured out the SOAP was what was making my bathroom smell so awful!
2,does not contain enough neem,I had to use a drug store sold anti fungus cream. The 20% of neem oil in this soap did not even begin to kill my skin fungus
2,It's okay : ( updated review 10/15/2010,"I know it is a bit early for a review but I just can help myself, I just got the soap yesterday. In the other reviews that I have seen for this product a lot of people kept say how bad the soap smelled, but in my opinion the smell was not that bad at all. It smelled like peanuts but it's nothing to over the top. That is all I can say about the product for now. I will write a review on the results in regards to my acne in a couple of weeks.October 15th Update!!!To update you guys on my opinion of this product,I found it to be just okay, not great, not good but okay : (. I did not notice a change in my acne at all. I stopped using it after 3 weeks and started using another cleanser. You can check out my profile page to see my review on the ""Other Cleanser""."
3,Good Soap when used in addition with other Neem aids,"Like many other reviewers noted the soap is good, not a miracle worker or you probably have to use for an extended time. I have used this product and other similiar soap with Neem oil. This was not the top but better than regular and did not dry out my skin. I have always use in combination with one of neem oil products. I am having alot more success with thePure Concentrated Ayurvedic Neem Balm for Relieving Acne. Psoriasis, Rosacea and Morefor my specific skin problems. With that I would consider purchasing again when accompanying treatment with the Neem Balm."
3,"Quality soap, but stinky.","It cleanses very well and does what it promises. However, the smell is...interesting. I have a pretty good sense of smell. I detect the following in the scent of this soap (in order of strength):Crushed green leaves. (obviously)Manure. (grassy barnyard)Cooked liver.Dirt.Honey.Peanuts.I would not say this soap has an offensive odor, but I certainly wouldn't call it pleasing."
4,It's Okay,"I don't have a particular skin problem, although I'm susceptible to acne -- on my back and face, and my face is very sensitive to chemicals. This soap doesn't cause my face to break out and is very safe. I did not notice any particular positive results, however. The odor of the soap is so mild it's unnoticeable. It suds up well and although it's a small bar, it lasts quite a while. I wish I had some ""miracle"" to report but I don't. I can't even say that the soap made my skin noticeably softer or smoother. All I can say is that it does no harm and is safe to use on a face with sensitive,complex skin."
4,Great Soap,"I love this soap. It doesnt have the strong smell of most neem products. It has helped clear up the intended skin problem, plus it has helped clear up other skin issues for which it was not intended. I give 4 stars because it doesnt seem to last as long as other soaps even though I make sure not to leave it sitting in water."
3,Eh,"I bought this for my daughter. Neem oil is supposed to be good for acne. My daughter tried it for a few weeks, but didn't notice a difference. I probably wouldn't try it again."
2,Too stinky,"I couldnt get past the smell, and my girlfriend couldnt either.. I didnt use it long enough to tell if it worked or not b/c i smell was just too much."
5,Great Recital Gift,I bought a dozen of these to give to my daughter's dance class for recital. It was well received.
1,Obsolete product,"I ordered this product when my previous surge arrest pro broke. But when I received it I discovered that it is an old product of this company. I am sorry to see Amazon.com selling obsolete products, rather than the very latest. The latest model APC PRO8T2 has been out for nearly a year, priced at the same amount, and I don't think you even offered it."
2,Book review for HMS Expedient,"I had high hopes for this book and series. It is the only book in the series that I have read.I've read Age of Sail genre for years and this book didn't hold up to my expectations.I am confused as to who this series is supposed to be about. The Captain or his first Lt.I felt like the captain had a bad case of multiple personality disorder and would not listen to common sense and then waited for his first Lt. to bail him out of situations he created. I am not used to this type of writing. I'm used to the captain having an understanding of sailing and the sailors who work for him and the ship and I can't figure out how this yahoo ever got a commission in the first place.The captain character was either blowing hot or cold through out the book and this was very annoying. I kept waiting to see if the book would turn into another ""Mutiny on the Bounty"" story.I had high hopes for this series and am now sad by the first book and my first impressions."
5,Cool School Bag / Sling / Backpack,"This is a great school bag. (4th & 5th grades) More than enough room for a big binder, lunch, light jacket and misc. kid stuff. Great pockets and the variable sling (right or left sided) is a thoughtful feature."
5,Great Pack,This has been a very versatile bag and is stylish too. I have used it to commute to work in the city during the week and as a diaper bag on the weekends. I love this bag and all of its compartments.
4,Great for day hikes.,I originally purchased this pack for day hiking and I love it. The mesh pocket on the side is great for holding bottled water and is easily accessible. I am now using this pack to lug books to class but I find it difficult to fit all of my college texts inside. This pack has plenty of nooks and crannies that are great for stashing and finding things quickly and easily. My point and shoot digital camera fits perfectly into the pocket that is located on the strap which is great for keeping my hands free while hiking in rough terrain and I can still have my camera safe and within reach. I prefer this for day hiking rather then for school but it is still a great pack that is very durable and has traveled extensively with me. I would definitely buy this one again.
4,It is nice.,"I have no problems with this pack. it is on the small side, but i use it to carry things to the beach or the gym. I reallly do not belive that Amazon says this pack is 1995 cubic inches, There is no way. but then again, i recently bought an 8 ounce portable hard drive that they said had a shipping weight of 6 pounds. DUH."
4,Tarot of White Cats,"When I decided to learn about tarot cards, I did some investigating before hand. I also knew I wanted artwork that would inspire me. It was suggested to me to buy the Rider-Waite version because it was the most common and easiest to understand. I'm a cat lover and the Rider-Waite version, Tarot of White Cats, had some beautiful artwork. Upon receiving the cards in the mail, I was not disappointed! Even though my daughter found the workings of the tarot cards to be easier than myself, I'm still very happy with my decision to buy Tarot of White Cats based on my love of the artwork!"
5,Cats and Tarot,I love tarot and I love cats. I did not know that Tarot of White Cats existed and I was very happy to find out I could get it at Amazon.comThat tarot respects the one I am used to which is Tarot of Marseille in that it carries the same or almost the same definitions that I am used to. I do not have any regrets and I might order it again as a gift for a friend because many of my friends are tarot and cat lovers as well.Thank you very much.Lise
2,Skim this one,This book was disappointing. The only redeeming value was that it led me to other books about adventurers whom I would have not otherwise known. This book misses the richness of travel and adventure. You don't need to buy this book. Simply skim it in a book store and see where it leads you.
5,A new favorite,"I have been listening to this CD constantly for days now. Kate has a wonderful ear for beautiful melodies, and this CD is proof that it is possible to get hauntingly beautiful music without a synthesizer. I don't think this CD will be a fad among my collection -- I think I will be listening to this one for years."
4,Good but...,"I like the mood of the CD, and Kate's voice is great. My only reservation here is that most of the 16 trax are quite similar and slow. They don't really show her range."
5,Another great album from an artist at the top of her game...,"It is difficult to believe that someone so young could be so accomplished in her field. And yet Kate Rusby is indeed an amazingly talented artist. This album, celebrating her tenth year in the family business (both her parents are folk musicians, and her brother Joe handles sound and mixing on Kate's albums and in her concerts), shows why Kate has been so successful. Her arresting voice conveys the mixture of heartache and hope in the traditional style of her native England, both in well-known songs, and those written by Kate and her husband and partner, John McCusker. What sets this album apart from past albums, is the combination of studio and live tracks. In the tracks recorded on tour, one gets a taste of this powerful performer. This is a great album for those who are new to Kate's work, and I can guarantee you'll be hooked."
4,Remnick has done it again! Brilliant reporting!,"David remnick has written a book that is a sequel to his ""Lenin's Tomb"" of several years ago. It gives a revealing look at how life is in Russia after the fall of Communism there in 1991. After reading it,I felt a greater appreciation for life here in the United States. He is a truly great writer! This book should be read by anyone interested in Post-Communist Russia. I highly recommend it!"
5,musty book,While the book is used and as represented it was not noted as very musty smelling.. I believe it had been stored in a damp basement or garage such that I now must keep it in the garage to keeep from contamination other books in my library.
3,wheel is a little noisy,"it was a present for somebody else, so I cannot really review this item... the only thing I realized was, that the wheel was a little noisy, and we were not able to figure out how to use the zoom functions at once..."
2,"body too narrow, buttons require a lot of presure",The mouse body is too narrow for my hands. I prefer the older models that do not get narrower towards the palm of the hand. The mouse buttons require a lot of pressure.Tracking and wheel is ok which is why I gave it any stars at all.
2,I don't like it,"it's work fine with my laptop and desktopand window xp and vista alsothe other thing is goodgrip is also goodbut when I use wheel click, (rigth click and left click are perfectily fine, but only wheel click)mouse sometimes ignore my wheel click.it may means you need to click harder this mouse than average wheel mousethe other thing is perfect, but the problem is I'm using wheel clickcontinuously only one problem is very big problem for me..but some people do not use wheel click, so if you do not use wheelit will be fine for you. and whee scroll sound is bad"
5,Replacement Mouse,"Bought this mouse to replace a similar one that I had worn out. Just open the box and plug and use, no software needed. Doesn't stick, scrolls easily. Very happy with purchase."
3,Decent if a bit lightweight,This is a decent optical mouse. I was hoping for a more substantial feeling and while the build quality is good it just feels thin in my hand. Price was great from Amazon.
4,Great for Large Heads,"I have a really hard time trying to find hats that fit my large head. I wore this hat in Floriday for a week and it was fine. The XXXL size fit my 28"" head and gave me the sun protection I needed when boating."
2,Not for my purposes,Vibrates fine.Alarm is fine.But I want it to vibrate me every 20 minutes.You have to set 20 minutes in the countdown timer and then it goes to 0. Then you have to painfully set 20 minutes again. You can't even hit start again.Vibralite 3 does this and even automatically restarts but unfortunately it wasn't clear for Vibralite 2.
4,"wakes me up, which is what I wanted it for","I bought this originally 2 years ago for a trip to europe so I could sleep with ear plugs in a hostel and still wake up on time. It serves this function quite well. What the others have said about the design flaws are true, but not fatal errors.I still use this watch as an alarm on a regular basis. It is pretty big, and if I tighten it to the smallest hole it still moves around a bit on my wrist. It isn't so loose, however, that I can't feel the vibration. The vibration is also really loud. if you were using it because you didn't want to wake another person in the room, it might not work for that purpose.I've had it for 2 years now and it's still going strong. Good watch that does what it says it does."
5,Good book,I really appreciate Brother Chadwicks understanding of the need for christian growth and perfection. He has great insight and I would truly recommend this book.
3,keifer should have been given an Oscar.....,"Sure there are some slow areas, but kiefer's crying scene was the most real crying sene I have seen to this day by a man. I think it was Oscar worthy. Not ""acting"" crying, but I felt he was doing a natural crying that would take place at that kind of moment.If your an artist, you will like this movie because of the artist's struggle."
1,amazon should remove this from their shelves,"I found this movie while researching the life of Paul Gauguin - evidently something not a single person involved in the production thought to do. The acting is phoned in, the score is cheap, and the historical accuracies are rooted in what could very well be no more than a Wikipedia entry. I've seen softcore pornography directed with more gravitas. I'll stop my review of the film here as it doesn't even merit the thought I've given thus far.If you're searching for a title with more substance and information, look a generation back to Donald Sutherland's performance as Paul in WOLF AT THE DOOR. Not an easy movie to find but worth it."
3,a mixed bag,"Cecilione should be given credit for at least trying something different, even if he doesn't quite pull it off. A young actress finds that a mysterious visitor appears in her apartment late at night, then, after a chance meeting at a bookstore, goes off to an isolated home in the country to live with a best-selling author, who keeps her prisoner and may or may not have some dark secrets he doesn't want revealed. Along the way, the actress has to deal with a Planter's bag of assorted nuts, any one of whom may or may not be her mysterious visitor. The plot takes its time to get where it's going, and the actress is oddly passive and accepting about these things most of the time. I had made a mental list of things I found wrong with the book, but the ending answered just about all of them. The author pulls off a nice trick ending-- just barely. I think if he had re-worked this novel a little more, he could have had a dynamite thriller."
2,This is an exact duplicate of the book published in 1996,"This book is page for page a copy of the 1996 publication. There are no new heads, only updated prices. Has was the first book, it is not comprehensive. I am sorry that I spent $30.00, plus shipping and handling for the same book I already have."
3,Encyclopedia of Head Vases ( A Schiffer Book for Collectors),"The shipping was fast and book is very nice, but it was of no help to me because it did not show any of the vases that I have. Because of the large quantity of vases out there, I can't fault the book for that. That being said, it was disappointing to not find even one of my vases in the book."
4,Great for Protecting the Tent Floor,"The foor print is a simple fitted tarp for the tent, but makes a difference in how long the tent floor will last as a protection layer.After 2 backpacking trips and multiple weekend camping trips, I would reccomend Kelty footprints for those who are looking to protect their tent."
3,Carioca Diferente,"Carioca is the most unusual album by Chico. Lyrics are 90% free of the music context. Which is good. At the end with the terrifc ""Imagia"" (music by maestro Jobim), we have a felling that Carioca could be Chico's last work in music...I hope not..."
3,Shipwrecks in Florida,"Good accounting of 35 shipwrecks that have occured in or near Florida waters. The stories cover the older Spanish shipwrecks and some of the newer ones as well. An easy read, but not a deep scholarly tome."
4,Otis shines through,"This looks like a fairly cynical ploy. Let's get a blues star who's had some sizeable hits on a small label, take him to Muscle Shoals with the best session musicians we can find, and...oh yeah get him to record some of our songs. Mike Bloomfield and Nick Gravenites gave him some fairly dire songs to record, but were unable to prevent Otis Rush shining through, and in places making some old chestnuts live again.The undoubted top tracks are ""It takes time"" (self written by the man) a great version of B.B.King's ""Gamblers blues"" and a belting version of Chuck Willis' ""Feel so bad"".You'd best programme out Tracks 2 & 7,they weren't good to start with and haven't lasted well. Two other points. Firstly the band when they get into their stride really swing, and Jerry Jemmott on bass holds it altogether terrifically well. Secondly the stereo separation is the kind of weird deal that recording engineers would never even attempt today.A triumph in spite of the material"
4,Killer Grooves,"I am a groove fan and nobody grooves better than Jerry Jemmott. Jerry provide the octane throughout this record and especially on 'Me','My Old Lady' and 'Baby I Love You'. If you like groove oriented blues then get this album."
3,bug screen,"we had to go on vacation with out it because it was missing couple of the eyelets to attach it to the car.i was a little dissapointed but i guess you get what you pay for ,so you live and learn.It would have worked great butif you buy it make sure it has everything with it."
3,"A barely okay product for the value, read on for more","I would have given this product only 2 stars but being you 'get what you pay for' and this item was quite cheap, I bumped it up to 3 stars. I have 2 problems with this product. The first is its a 1 size fits most kind of grill and it doesn't have any curve to it. This would be better suited on late 80's vehicles with the flatter fronts. This didn't fit too well over my Pontiac.Second beef: Only 2 hooks. The stability wasn't satisfactory only tethering this to 2 points on my wheel base. I went to Home depot and bought a 4 pack of hooks and made the mounting of this product much more secure."
1,Broken out of the Box.,"what a disappointment for my daughter. Santa brought her a broken toy. The lights worked but no sound from the start. Santa needs to do some better shopping next time! 5 stars for the ""Welcome to the Real World"" education this toy gave her."
2,Fun for a very short time. Broken Disco!,"My children loved the toy for about 5 hours! They put on a show standing on our coffee table, but the microphone malfunctioned and stopped working within the time of one evening."
1,DISAPPOINTED SHOPPER,"I have been an Amazon shopper for years and I have never been so upset over a purchase. I have not even received the item yet and I will never shop e-Toys again. They charged me $20.90 shipping charges on a $19.94 order...you have got to be kidding me. Stick with Toys-R-Us folks....they care about their consumer.Amazon, you should re-consider having e-Toys as one of your vendors"
1,battery won't charge,Bought this battery for use on my vacation. Wouldn't hold a charge for more then 30 seconds. Charger woulnd charge for more then 5 minutes. Proved to be useless. used my AC on the camera to get a few memorys.

5,Much needed principles for Christians,"A breath of fresh air. Finally, a book that properly separates earthly politics fom the kingdom of God. An easy read. Biblically based."
5,MUCH NEEDED IN THE CHURCH TODAY!,"""If My kingdom was of this world, my discples would fight,"" replied Jesus to Pilate when questioned concerning Jesus' kingship. This very idea of God's kingdom is applied to the current Christian's role in the kingdoms of the world and what a Christian can and should do to influence the world for God. Easy to read and highly recommended. www.michaelvbaxter.com"
4,A Must Read!,"I just recently finsihed reading Gregory Boyd's book entitled, The Myth Of A Christian Nation. I was given this book as a gift from a friend who happens to be a Freewill Baptist Minister. At last there is hope! This book should be a required reading for every church member. The people in this country are so ignorant of real history and of the true tenents of Jesus' ministry. This is not one of those books that attempts to label the forefathers as die-hard Diests, although their Diestic tendencies are mentioned. Boyd does a wonderful job comparing the differences between the Kingdom of the World and the Kingdom of God. This thought-provoking work will certainly find a permanent place on my shelf!Randall F. HubbardHistory TeacherSpringville, Alabama"
4,Very Enlightening and also Biblical,"I thought the book was very well written, and gave a unique perspective on the Kingdom of God, as oppose to the kingdom of this world. I recommend anyone who wants a taste of this book to check out an excellent sermon by Boyd entitled taking America back for God, located at his churches website, whchurch.org, under sermon resources, april 2004. It is an excellent sermon that adds excitement to what this book explains."
2,An important point wrapped in questionable theology,"Boyd makes a very important point in confronting an American church that has become far too cozy with the political institutions of the day, for this I applaud him. But it becomes clear very early on in the book that the author is working from within the context of so-called ""open theism"" and post-millenialism. The introduction and first chapter are sufficient to make the point that the title of the book proposes to advance. After that, Boyd tries to back up his thesis using his questionable theology. This is unfortunate as a conservative understanding of the scriptures can provide sufficient support to back up the same thesis. Overall, I respect the idea that the author is advancing and I recommend that every Christian think carefully about his challenging idea, but I cannot recommend this particular work on the subject as it is couched in Boyd's questionable theological framework."
4,Enlightening,"All of us bring our cultural personal baggage into every aspect of life so that none of us are unbiased in our understanding or opinions of things like the Bible and Christianity. As someone who was raised in a very politically, Biblically, and morally conservative home, one can see all the texts that support that belief systems while somehow unintentionally blinded to the ones that contradict them. D. Boyd does an excellent job of communicating his thoughts clearly and simply while exegeting the texts thoroughly and faithfully. I so appreciate his attention to the original context and am pleasantly surprised by the obviousness of the text that for whatever reason has largly been absent in most evangelical circles."
5,This will make you think.,"This book will challenge, possibly offend and shock many a Christian reader. The arguments are compelling and convincing, adding further to the unsettling effect it will have. Agree or disagree, it will make you think."
2,Spiritually challenging; historically inaccurate...,"This book challenges the lack of love observed in the ""Christian"" community... oops there has never been a Christian community? The challenge to be more loving and Christ-like is thought provoking and well based. The historical premise for the underlying message is VERY flawed. The author needs a history refresher course."
2,If you just can't call abortion wrong,"If it's basically impossible for you to force the words ""abortion is murder and murder is wrong"" out of your pen you might be a liberal. Dr. Boyd, what a disappointment. You had me till then. Abortion is the ultimate violence."
5,Things that are Caeser's,"Rev Boyd reminds us that when you mix politics and religion neither comes out the better. Jesus Christ gave his followers one charge, and that was to care for the poor. There is not one word about political parties or getting out the vote.Passing more laws will not makes us a better people or a better nation, living better lives will. By all means, get involved in the political process, join the military, join service clubs and give to Caeser the things that are his. But when you enter the House of God, follow His rules."
4,This is actually a Cuisinart DLC-869TX-1 Dough Blade,"This item is NOT a Cuisinart Stainless Steel Chopping Blade as the title states. It is a Cuisinart DLC-869TX-1 Dough Blade. I contacted Amazon, just asking them to fix the incorrect listing. They said that I had to complain to ""Small Appliance"" - the 3rd party seller of the item. It is a bad listing on Amazon's web site, for goodness sakes. Why don't they take responsibility and contact the seller?Anyway, if you are looking for a Dough Blade, this works just fine. If you are looking for the Stainless Steel Chopping Blade, search for part # DLC-861TX on Amazon. That will find the actual stainless steel chopping blade for the Cuisinart food processors listed on this page."
5,kitchen aide products,"I couldn`t be more pleased with this product. I only make Jerky when using it but it is real user friendly,and works well when slicing my meat even though the meat is almost frozen. Near frozen or solid thick meat cuts so much better. Pretty easy to clean up also. I did buy some organic lubricant for the blade gears, and also a pair of the kevlar gloves to be real safe using it. I am well pleased with this, especially for the price."
4,Just got for Christmas,"I am excited to try my slicer out. Due to the other reviews, it seems like it is a quality machine for home use and then some. Not as big as I expected, and thats a good thing. I wasn't sure where I was going to store it, but it can fit in a cabinet. Already cut some cheeses on it, and it was smooth. I will say, it kind of moved the cheese around on me, and I was pressing it against the wall pretty snug. Maybe the other blade will make a difference, or I need a little practice. Can't wait to get my other blade!"
2,"Good to slice things, hard to clean","This was the first slicer I bought and I wanted to see if I would actually use it. It turned out to be a popular fixture in my family's kitchen, slicing bread, deli meats and roasts, etc. It did a good job, but the plastic parts did move a bit too much for my liking, making it hard to get a really thin slice of salami. I was able to disassemble it the first couple of times easily, but the locking mechanism on the blade broke the third time, and I was unable to get the blade off. Having just sliced raw meat I did not want to continue using it if I could not get the whole blade and slicer cleaned. I have returned this product, but have already purchased the next step up slicer which is all metal and has a different blade locking system."
3,Not all that great,I have used this once and it is not all that great. Meat hangs up in it and will not slice cleanly. It is a real bugger to clean up too. This is one kitchen gadget I probably would not buy again.
