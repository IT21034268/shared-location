5,"Remarkable insights, advice and counsel","This remarkable book covers the entire spectrum of bringing a child into this world, from all stages of pregnancy through birth and infant care, with compassion and deep insights. Written in easy-to-understand language and amply illustrated, it not only answers all of your questions but does so in a comprehensive yet concise manner with great insight."
2,BROKEN CHAIR,"THANK GODNESS I BOUGHT ONE WITH A WARRANTY, YOU WILL NEED IT, SAVE ALL YOUR PAPERWORK EVEN AFTER YOU RETURN IT.BECAUSE NOW I CAN'T FIND MY INVOICE AND I'M GETTING BILLED FORM UPS"
5,Wonderful,"We can dispute who got the most play time and focus, but the dvd is worth its price for Oistrakh's performance of the Shostakovich Aminor Cadenza. My taste and loyalty are usually with Heifetz, but Oistrakh's performance was out of this world."
2,the Art of Violin,"Not as good a product as I had expected. Some of it was garbly, not like the original."
2,an disappointed violin lover,"I was so excited to receive this DVD. However, after I have viewed it, the only words I can say are ""extremely disappointed"". There are many players in the black and white film,some of them are talking not playing, and they only show part of the piece for what they were playing. The entire film is a waste of time. When I requested to return it, they wanted me to pay for the postage. This is the biggest disappointment I ever had from purchasign through Amozon."
5,A Film Every Violinist Must See,"The Art of Violin opens the eyes of the violinist to the most important aspects of the violin world. The rare and extensive footage of the world's greatest violinists is a privelege to view. This dvd is truly valuable not only because of the vast exposure to the greatest violinists but also to much of the great violin repertoire. My favorite part is the opening in which pieces of the Mendelssohn concerto are played by different violinists and then put together so that the whole movement runs smoothly but the various styles of each artist are portrayed. If you are a violinist, you must not go another day without seeing The Art of Violin!"
5,Great CD,The video is interesting and informative. The violin playing is incredible. It would be great if perlman was playing on it too.
5,Outstanding video,"This is a wonderful documentary of the great violinists of the 20th century. A must for any student, teacher or lover of the instument."
4,the art of violin,"As I know, this is the first published material contaning ex-virtuosi of violin playing. Historic visions of the greatest violinists of the past-time are sufficient to excite who loves classical music. Too many appearance of Sir Y Menuhin's playing is a flaw of a precious stone."
3,Manual is manual and as such it serves as a fast guide of consultation.,"All that that acts in the area of veterinary natural medicine needs a fast guide of consultation, of the type Five Minutes.This manual serves very well for a first consultation and to guide the first treatment mainly by the use of Chinese and western herbs, diet, acupuncture and other therapies.Therefore, it is an indispensable book to every veterinary naturopata.And the index is of easy consultation and very complete, still containing the appendixes, very useful and practical.I recommend a lot of this book."
4,good so far,"I honestly have not read much of it yet. I am only going through the intro, but I am finding it interesting. The only thing that has put me off so far is that they put in new chinese terms without defining them. I guess it is not important to know what they all mean, but I feel weird not knowing. It talks about upper, middle and lower burners and then talks about upper, middle and lower jiao. And I am guessing jiao means burner, but I would feel better if they stated that."
5,AWESOME,"This book is awesome, I had no idea when I purchased it what secrets it held. I am so happy I bought it, it makes so much sense! So much work ahs gone into the book I love it - I love the sabian symbols and I am buying MORE BIRKBECK BOOKS!MARINA"
1,Al Adamson fails again.... Stay away!,"I had seen two movies by Al Adamson before this one, ""Dracula vs Frankenstein"" and ""Vampire Men of the Lost Planet"", so needless to say, my expectations weren't very high, but this movie still managed to disappoint me.As usual, it doesn't take long until Al Adamson seems to forget the main plot, and instead focuses on totally uninteresting side plots. And unlike ""Vampire Men of the Lost Planet"", this movie isn't the least ""good-bad"", it doesn't have any entertainment value at all except maybe in some of the scenes in the beginning with John Carradine. He gets top billing but his part is actually pretty small.I can not recommend this movie, not even to fans of bad movies, like myself. Save yourself the time and money."
4,Blood of Ghastly Horror,"Alot of twists & turns in this one. If you like'm off-the-wall, and with a ""B"" movie appeal, you gotta check it out. I love John Carradine in any role. He was made for low budget horror."
2,Not what it seems...,"This is not a comprehensive book on the field of Urban Design. Although this is obvious from the subtitle one is left with dissapointment. Aside from an interesting collection of cases studies you really don't get the complexity and timeless cross-section of this field that is having a renaissance now. None of the current trends are mentioned nor do they get any strong coverage (new urbanism/trasnurbanism/reurbanism/everyday urbanism/splintered urbanism/complexity urbanism) nor does the historical element comes through. Generaly good written book but too much of a sallad bowl without a proper structure and philosophy. Not a good tool for teaching. If you want top of the pops book in this field go to D.Grahame Shane's Recombinant Urbanism. For me it was astonishing how little space was given to new urbanism, the leading urban design theory and practice today."
1,Pro wheel junk,Had the shock for about a week before the shock shaft bent. Would not recommend to anyone to buy this. Also the spring is very soft for any one that weighs over 140. Go buy a fox shock instead
2,review of order,The book I received does not look like the one pictured. I was a little disappointed in that. I kept the book though as I wanted the story.
5,WONDERFUL RESEARCH SOURCE,"There are actually two volumes to this work. The first covers the period from 1927 through 1936 and the second 1937 through 1946. This work is simply a journal, diary of a Ozark Preacher and his travels throughout the region of S. West Missouri. It covers in detail the writer's work with the various churches in in circut. The book is a wealth of names and places, now, long forgotten. The work is very, very detailed and I have found it to be almost irreplaceable as a research tool. The books are locally published and rather difficult to find, but are well worth the effort. Highly recommend this work."
5,An incredible cornucopia from the father of rock 'n' roll,"You can keep your Squirrel Nuts zipped up tight -- Louis Jordan was the king of swing. This is where big band jazz began to mutate into rock 'n' roll. There are plenty of single and double discs out there to give you a taste of Jordan, nicknamed ""Kind of the Jukeboxes,"" but this 9-disc blowout from the blessed maniacs at Germany's Bear Family serves up his complete output on Decca/Capitol, his greatest decade-plus. Only box set I ever bought where I finished disc 6 and hurried to cue up disc 7. Steep price, but worth every penny."
5,WOW,"Buy it! If you are here looking at this collection do not stress over the price tag. It is worth every penny and much more. I bought this collection months ago and I have been listening to it on random play ever since. I haven't listened to anything else except a little count bassie. Not only is the music great, it is fun. I only wish I bought it sooner.I originally ""discovered"" Louis Jordan because of the Blues Brothers movie. Elwood plays Let the Good Times Roll in his apartment when Jake falls asleep on his bed."
2,Not very well done,"I'll concur with the other reviews here. The book is short on scholarship and is really a precis of the work of others. Little in the way of references, and one suspects, original research. No significant conclusions, no real surprises, and a very straight-forward retelling of well-known biographies.The author should probably have chosen lesser well known subjects, and done more primary research with extensive footnotes. Even if one argues this is simply intended as ""light reading"", it's all been said before."
5,Excited!,"When I received this case, I was so excited and impressed - it was just what I wanted. I especially like the color and how sturdy it is. I definitely recommend it."
2,Buyer Beware,"I purchased this bed to fit a very specific space in my home. The specs listed here on Amazon are in correct, and as a result, the bed did not fit in the space I had allotted for it. On the merchant's own website are the accurate measurements. The bed has promise - as a nice grown up trundle. However, there are a number of annoying flaws with the product itself. The frame is crooked in places. The pop up mattress is a good 6-7"" shorter than the main mattress - far smaller than it needs to be to fit under the bed.The bed has turned out to be comfortable, but for the price, the flaws were extremely irritating. Ultimately, we cut the frame to fit our space, no small endeavor. Furthermore, I awaited delivery for about 3 weeks while the merchant waited for it from the manufacturer. I had to turn away a number of guests.In the end, I will probably get good use out of this bed, but it has not been a simple purchase, and I would say to be very careful."
4,The man itself!!!!,"I saw Peter Tosh in this tour while I was studying in New Orleans (Sept. 1983), I am not sure if it was just before or after this show was taped. Well, unfortunatly we can not see him anymore, but this DVD captures the escence of this great show. Great performance by PT and the band, specially Santa Davis (drums) and Fully Fulwood (bass). If you like reggae or if you like to see a good show, just go ahead an get this DVD, you will not regret it. A gret show from one of reggea prime musician. I only gave it four stars because the DVD has only part of the performance, for full concert please check the double CD Captured Live."
5,"Peter Tosh ""Captured Live"" was awsome","Peter Tosh Captured Live reminded me so much of the time I had the opportunity to have attended one of his concerts at the pier many years ago. He was a man of great depth and a militant style who was not afraid to speak out lyrically about oppression, police brutality, exploitation, poverty... This is a great DVD to add to your collection. Peter Tosh ""Mystical Man"" gone but not forgotton, your music will live on forever!!"
5,RASTAFARI - IS,"I AM A NEW FAN OF PETER AND IT IS PRETTY MUCH BECAUSE OF THIS DVD. WHILE IT ONLY HAS HALF OF WHAT YOU CAN HEAR ON THE LIVE CD, I THINK IT TAKES THE BEST SONGS. MY FAVORITE IS THE 12 MINUTE RASTAFARI-IS WHICH IS THE HEIGHT OF THE SHOW AS FAR AS IM CONCERNED. I SEE THE BASS PLAYER AND DRUMMER GET MENTION BUT THE KEYBOARDIST ALSO DESERVES SOME PRAISE AS HE DAZZLES US ESPECIALLY ON THIS SONG. MANY CLIPS ON YOUTUBE ARE PULLED FROM THIS DVD/VHS. THE SOUND IS TOTALLY 80'S, AND WHATS BEST IS PETERS SPIRIT DURIN THE SHOW, HE SEEMS HAPPY AND EXPRESSES THIS IN DANCE WHICH IS QUITE DIFFERENT THAN OTHER SHOWS. NOT THAT IVE SEEN MANY OF HIS AS THEY ARE ONLY BITS AND PIECES ON DVDS AND INTERNET. THIS IS A MUST FOR PETER FANS"
5,peter tosh is awesome,"I love this Peter Tosh dvd---it is awesome. Its great to see him in action, enjoying delivering his 'ministry', although as another reviewer mentioned the all white audience does look bored. As a major Tosh fan, this is a necessity. I only wish I had been there for the real deal."
4,Reggae Fan1,Peter Tosh is the ultimate performer of our time. I was able to feel the vibration even after the music has stopped playing. I watched the DVD with friends and we all had a blast. I highly recommend the DVD to all reggae music lovers.
4,use flashcards to learn words anywhere,"I learned about this set of flashcards from Beestar online vocabulary program. My child has been using it for several month. A great benefit of flashcards is that you can carry some to anywhere to review the words and make measurable progress every week. It has been our favorite activity for waiting line time. As the remembered-stack getting taller, my child's vocabulary snowballs. It's great way to repeat without stress. To gasp the usages of the words, your child also needs to read extensively to expand his exposure of the words learned. This easy-pick-up-n-put-down tool makes a daunting task easier than expected."
5,Beautiful!!!,"This was a gift for a good friend who is Spanish. The pitcher was just as pictured and signed on the bottom. Came in a very timely fashion, before expected. I would definitely buy from them again."
5,Sneak Peak,"JMAC is the title of a single cd by Jesse McCartney. This cd includes ""Beautiful Soul"", ""Why Don't You Kiss Her"" and ""Don't You"". If you love Jesse, who is a former member of the band Dreamstreet and played Adam Chandler Jr. on All My Children, you will love this cd. Just wait til his debut album hits stores and then you can see what Jesse's all about. This cd is only a sneak peak. So you can already imagine how truely awesome it will be."
4,"Great voice, so-so songs...","I'd never been a fan of DreamStreet until I met Jesse McCartney when he judged a local singing competition I was in. At first I just checked him out with a somewhat feeble hope of buttering him up in the competition, but I soon became hooked on his voice. It's very mature for someone his age, and when I listened to some old DreamStreet stuff, I was amazed at how well his singing voice has matured over the years. His songs aren't the greatest, but the acoustic version of ""Don't You"" (just keep listening to Track 3) allows you to hear him really sing. Jesse is talented, and despite the stereotype that all pop stars are arrogant &%@#!@#$s, I can tell you from experience that he's anything but arrogant. He's a sweet kid (he gave me this CD for free), an awesome performer...oh yeah, and hot, but that doesn't matter..."
5,JMAC rocks!,"Jesse McCartney is (in my opinion) the best teen boy singer BY FAR. I have all of his cds, dvds, any thing he has come out with I've got. I even have my own website for him. He has an amazingly smooth and cute voice, He's got the look down perfectly, he is so modest and easygoing dosn't have a big head at all, every one loves him. He also has a certain sound, a kind of soul in his voice and music. you can't get that any more.That is why I rate him a 5.~Z~"
5,Still doing great,"Althought this CD has only a few songs, its still great! I've loved Jesse since he was in Dream Street. He has an awesome voice that could put a smile on anyones face. When I played this song for my friends who dont even listen to pop-type music, they loved it! This goes to show that Jesse is a great singer! I can't wait to buy his album!!!!"
1,WHATTTT,7O something dollars for a 3 songed cd? WHAT IS UP WITH THIS...im glad i got the 14 songed cd on his beautiful soul cd...sheesh man you'd be dumb to buy this cd its 7o FRICKEN dollars or something...heck no's man...i suggest you get the orignal cheaper cd for like 14 dollars...sheesh man.
1,Pop music...thats all it is...bubblegum pop,"I have not purchased this album (and I definetly do not plan to) I've heard the recordings (all 3) and I must admit, Jesse McCartney has an 'ok' voice but hes nothing spectactular and I think anyone who is saying ""Oh Dream Street was the best band and so is ""JMac""!"" Well, I don't reccomend any of this crap to anyone above the age of 10 years old...listen to something a little more 'in' like Good Charlotte or Something Corporate...or if you're still in the pop stage and you're my age (14) try The All-American Rejects (they're more Emo/punk) but they have the poppy sound but still have talent and are good artists. Pop bands have no talent...the majority of them do not write their own songs, and they are formed throughout auditions. A good band worked together and has a better story to tell than ""Oh, I had a great audition and I was very nervous.."" thats pop...and Pop is stupid and I do not recommend JMac"
5,Jmac,This EP is GREAT!!!! I got it at his concert and listened to it everyday since! He has a great voice and the lyrics on Why Dont You Kiss Her as so sweet ! Beautiful Soul is also a great song! O yeah the hidden track with Dillion playing on the guitar 4 stars !!! GO by it now !!!
5,A delight,I first read this book shortly after it was published and have used its gentle wisdom many times since. This year in my church we have encouraged members of our congregation to read it and the results have been very good. Most people find that it gives them a deep sense of the meaning of Sabbath and a resolve to make some changes in their own experience of Sabbath as a day of est and renewal. I highly recommend it for personal reading or for a book club.
2,Not the TRUE meaning of the Sabbath,"While this book gives practical examples of how to rest and find renewal by observing the Sabbath, it does not touch the true meaning of the Sabbath. As another reviewer mentioned, the value of this book was highly diminished for me when the author failed to emphasize the singly Judeo-Christian roots and values of the Sabbath. Instead, Muller takes a worldly approach to the psychology and therapy of observing the Sabbath and reflecting on life.This is the third book on the Sabbath that I have read, and it has by far been the least enlightening on truly why God has called us to rest and keep the Sabbath holy. While Muller's tips are helpful, I found similar ideas in a better book, ""Keeping the Sabbath Wholly"" by Marva Dawn (and she still preserved the deep & holy meaning of the Sabbath).Instead of Muller's book, I would highly recommend reading ""Keeping the Sabbath Wholly"" by Marva J. Dawn."
5,Sabbath,"This book is perfect for someone who wants to slow down and smell the roses, in other words, to take some time out from this busy world and relax, even if it is just a second or two of inhaling and exhaling before answering the telephone. It changed my life."
5,Sabbath,This is a fabulous book. It gave me new insight into why Sabbath (rest) time is so important. It fed me with information that motivated me to change a few things in my life. Wayne Muller is a wonderful author who is interesting and inspiring.
2,Not Truly Christian,I took reservation right away when Muller started quoting Ghandi with Christ. Great topic and I'm sure the principles are sound but there is no true rest with Christ and mixture.
3,I Disagree With the Author,"I do believe that we all need a day of rest, replenishment,and time to spend with our God.The author said that we don't have to do it on a specific day but that is wrong. In the 10 commandments, God said remember the Sabbath day on the 7th Day (Ex. 20). We should always spend time with God, but the 7th day is set aside from the rest of them."
4,Refreshing,"Sabbath is a great book whether you are spiritual or not. Everyone needs to find a release from the day-to-day crazy world we live in. This book just reaffirms the need for time to rejuvinate and relax. It is a great book for reflection and importance of ""down time""."
5,Without the plain brown sleeve,"When I purchased the CD, Amazon said there was only one in stock and more on the way. However, I believe this edition just went out of print. Too bad... I purchased the CD because my Sony ""Gene Autry Greatest Hits"" did not contain ""The Last Round Up,"" once again made famous by the DVD release of ""Public Enemy."" Amazon lists another edition of this CD with a DVD. Buy that one! Twenty four great songs are included, but not ""Ghost Riders in the Sky."" The sound quality meets my needs, although I miss the buzz of the steel needle on the vinyl 78. No, mine was not wind up, but you did get a shock, if you touched the arm just right, or wrong as the case might be. Great music to be treasured, and Gene always wore swell hats!"
5,Excellent,Excellent work. The reality at the core of all the pomp-and-circumstance surrounding EMU. Read it and be wiser.
3,"OK, but a polemic","This book is a polemic by an Austrian School economist who was unfortunately fired for writing along these lines while on holiday from his EU job. While I sympathize with many of his views, the thesis that the UK is radically different than Europe is flawed. Consider the facts: 50-55% of GDP in the UK is spent on government, the same percentage as in Italy and Greece. Germany and Spain spend slightly less (45-50%) while France spends more (>55%) (source: Wikipedia). So the degree of Big Government in these countries is a matter of degree, not kind. Let's face it: the British people, as most of Europe and Japan, and increasingly the USA, love Big Government, and have for the last two generations. This book should acknowledge that, rather than pretending the UK is some sort of bastion of libertarianism."
5,Very Nice T-Shirts - Reliable Seller,The T-shirts are a great quality and the seller had them to me in a decent amount of time.
1,Shrink Shrink Shrink!,"Very thin, comfy fabric, but shirt shrinks more every time it's washed. Great only if you like a very tight shirt. Maybe you have abs to show off or something. Also, the sleeves are too short and ride up your arm - not so good under a dress shirt, and you sure can't store your smokes there!"
3,Good looking but noisy,I had expected this upscale product to be noiseless and was disappointed to find it is sufficiently noisy that I have to keep it in a drawer.
5,A great product,the product was great and it was shipped fast 3 days to be in fact. The metal plate is a little to big but it looks great. you have to bend it to fit your head
5,Naruto Band,"My son was thrilled with the band. We received it very quickly, and the quality was satisfactory. I would buy from this seller again."
4,Great,"I personally love this headband. well made, great price. Only downside is that for smaller/younger people this headband might look kind of funny. the metal band wouldn't bend enough to fit a smaller/younger person's head properly and would make them look like they had a flat head lol. but other then that great product!"
5,Inside history of the White House,I thought this was a tasteful description of what went on behind closed doors. It was well written and informative. I enjoyed it very much.
2,Speakers,I was very unhappy with this purchase. It is okay if you do not care about sound quality. I was expecting a little better sound. The speakers that came with my computer sounded better (not much).
3,Useful but not enough,"While I liked what this book offered, it did not offer enough. I wanted something that gave me a great deal more information and insight and not just a few basics and exercises. What the authors do, however, they do well. I like how they write. After I read this book I read Diagonally Parked in a Parallel Universe which I found much more enlightening, insightful, personal and useful."
4,The Art of Making Elegant Wooden Boxes,"I found this book to very good on explaning how to make different kinds of joints, hinges, and box desings. It gives you many good desings to work off of and shows you how to use your tools properly. One thing that I did not like about the book was that it just shows you how make these boxes by just using power tools, but never tells you how to make them by just using hand tools, even though they do encourage it."
2,Check the dimensions - 'cause he didn't,"The boxes in this book are quite attractive. Construction technique is a little iffy (ie squareness is not assured through joinery, just by clamping it together and fiddling with it), but acceptable. However, the box that I built from it had incorrect dimensions in the cutting list, so the carefully grainmatched drawer pieces were too small for the hole. Not cool. There were other examples where it's clear that no-one made the boxes from the descriptions to confirm the instructions.I would recommend the book more for the concepts than the details."
3,Missing directions,"If you're looking for directions on how to make the beautiful boxes shown here, beware. In several places there are whole missing sections. For example, the list of pieces to make for one box contains 19 items, but only ten of them are shown in the lone diagram. You're on your own to figure out how the others go together.Also, the writing is often muddy. Some explanations are clumsily written.But the pictures are pretty."
2,Go buy a text book- You'll learn more,"Not worth the buy. I am an avid fan of Real Estate books and this one doesn't cut it. It is your basic real estate investing book. Synopsis of them all: Generalization of how to find undervalued homes, generalization on how to obtain financing, generalization on how to fix the place up, generalization on how to market the home, and a generalization on how to sell the home. With as many books as I've read I could write this book without ever having to sell a home."
3,certainly not a 'toy',"the review asked me to rate this 'toy.' I can't imagine any kid enjoying playing with Shakespeare magnets... it certainly is challenging! I've never read much Shakes, but it's fun to improve my vocab even in my 40's."
5,Love them!!,"These are by far the closest to the ones my sister and I had in the early 80's. While reading an earlier review I did take out the ""I"" pieces. It has 2 of them. The old magnets we had then were circle shaped. All of these are thin, rectangular strips. My 11 month old daughter can destroy almost anything, but not these! She can get them off the fridge, pack them to her room, but cannot get the magnets out! I recommend them to anyone, however, any little one still putting anything in their mouth, take out the ""I""'s! And never leave them alone!"
2,Odd Alphabet,"This had a most peculiar mix of letters that prohibited spelling even some of the simplest of words. Also, the magnets should be stronger to prevent accidental sweeping off."
3,Nothing special but for the price......,My son received these for Christmas. They are ok. They looked like the ones I had as a child but I quickly realized that the quality was not the same. The magnets are not that strong and one fell off before even putting it on the refrigerator. But I cannot complain because the price is low.
4,Fun for all ages!,"I purchased these magnetic letters for my son to use when he gets older (he's only 10 months old), but I find myself playing with them on the fridge. Kids who come over to my house can't resist re-arranging the letters, and it's nice to be able to use them to teach younger children how to spell. I think I'll order another set eventually, because I'd like to have duplicates of some of the letters to make bigger words."
3,okay,I got these letters because they are like the ones I had growing up and i wanted my daughter to have them. You can buy them cheaper at other places but I got them on Amazon because I was ordering some other things and I got free shipping. Some of the letters fall off the fridge since the magnetic strip is so small and often only on one side of the letter!I would buy different letters somewhere else.
5,5 stars but major warning!!!,"I gave this 5 stars in fairness to the company because package states it is for3+. I ordered these for my 9 month old because she loves magnets. These do what the say and are a classic. She loves taking them off and on fridge and dishwasher but mostly puts them in her mouth. This is where the warning comes in. Like other reviewers said, they are a bit small. All the letters seem ok EXCEPT THE LETTER I. This letter is perfect thing to choke on!!! Trust me- it came close to happening. So if you have a little one still putting everything in her mouth be careful. Take the 2 letter I's away and closely monitor when baby is playing with them. I love love love the leap frog magnetic farm- if your little one likes magnets check this out."
2,"Average product, outragous price","What is there to say about the latest Microsoft product? Well, not much... Win2k was designed to be a highly stable, reliable OS. But what else is new? Microsoft just can seem to put out the quality that linux distributers do these days. I have spent some time with the beta version on Win2k and although it felt pretty solid the price tag on the final version is quite a surprise. Why pay 200-2000 dollars for a product that can do the job of a literally free OS. I must say sticker shock will scare many people away, making them search for more cost effective solutions."
2,Dissapointed,"i upgraded from windows 98 it took about 2 hours on a 40 speed scsi and 450 mhz machine. I had to re install all my drivers, half of which it would not accept, GLSetup would not work so I could not play any decent games like soldier of fortune. Within 4 hours I deleted it and put back on windows 98. It is really good for business and networks, but for home computing I would wait until drivers and programs are avilable that support it."
2,Don't upgrade yet,"Windows 2000 is nothing more than NT that has been downgraded for the small time business owner. The only problem is that they rushed it to get it to the market in time and insodoing left a lot of loopholes in the design. The most crippling of which is 2000s lack of hardware compatability. If you are just running a small-time, bare bones server and dont want to spend the big bucks for NT, this is a better choice than 98. Otherwise, wait till the Millenium edition."
3,"It's OK, but...","The 2000 Pro is NOT for everyone. Games will not run well, older programs will not run well, and the system uses so much memory that you'll have RAM to run FEW things at once.I setup dual boot and compared both OS very well. 2K is more stable, but 98 SE runs fine if you are not installing and uninstalling programs everyday, or every week, or putting DEMOS to run. If you install and remove programs your registry gets damage and the 98 SE does not run well, and most likely crashes all the time.I'll remain with 98 SE."
3,Still some work for Microsoft,"After a couple days working with my new computer and Windows 2000 some first impressions: The first lockup occured during setup (clean, not over existing) on my new Presario 7940. Two times Windows 2000 did not finish a shut down request saying that an application (only MS Internet Explorer running at that time) is beinig debugged. MS Encarta 2000 does not run under Windows 2000. The application abords with a cryptic error message. All this with every available patch downloaded and installed.Over all Windows 2000 'looks' very nice and has several long missing features. Unfortunately it seems MS did not spent enough time to finalize it."
5,The most intuitive and smartest OS...,"This is the best, I mean it. There is no equal... the customizing, the features, the look, it's all there. You'll feel the difference."
1,Does it stink in here or is it just Win2000 pro?,"All I can say is BIG DISAPPOINTMENT. What is Microsoft thinking? They have managed to create an operating system that is compatible with NOTHING. Scanners, Printers, Cameras, Modems, you might as well throw them all out if you plan on using Win2000 pro. And if you think you can download an updated driver from Microsoft, think again. Especially if your modem is not supported by Win2000 pro. My computer is two months old! It amazes me how well Microsoft gave me the shaft. I didn't even see it coming. They better fix it!Peace. Word to the mother land."
3,Something atleast STABLE!,"boy, talk about time something that isn't so buggy from MS finals comes out! I use both Windows and Linux, and from my point of view, Linux is way superior. The only good product from Microsoft before Win2000 is uh, I don't remember anymore. It's funny how on MS website they put out reviews like ""solid as a rock"". althrought it's good that it's stable, but prize... it's bit too outragous. But, if Bill Gates really release the source code for Windows, then maybe Windows might be better."
4,Pretty good.....,"..As far as I been using W2k Beta 3 (8 months now), I never onced encountered a crash (unlike NT4, though RC1 users had some crashing problem and etc.). But MS still has long way to go to prove it to be match for either BeOS or FreeBSD or Linux in the 'concept' of stability. This we will see in the final release.Also, it's more mobile friendly than NT, though you will need to check your BIOS for compatibilty."
5,Best thing Microsoft has put out,"I got my Microsoft Certification in NT 4 and decided I needed to upgrade my certification to Win2K. I have been running this product for a good 8 months. My opinion is that this is simply the best OS product Microsoft has put out for the desktop, and may be the best product MS has put out period (especially when compared against ME). Mind you that some older hardware and software are not fully-compatible with Win2k. However, if you have a newer machine it is a great product to have. It is extremely hard to crash this OS. The basic drawback to it is that some software will not run correctly, but with a little looking, you can generally know ahead of time which titles won't run properly."
3,Very good and stable but....,"This program is very good and NEVER crashes (i e Blue screen of death) I used to get that alot on my PC.. 500 Celeron.But alot of software just doesn't work with it.Just make sure that your software for your DVD drive, Digital camera, and CD-RW work before you upgrade."
4,"a stable os, no blue screens, really works","all of the above, and more, has a higher learning curve then all other windows, but is more stable, faster, no blue screens, no lock ups. just a better os all around"
4,be forewarned!,"I have learned ""the hard way"" that the upgrade version cannot be used with Windows ME. I haven't read this anywhere in the documentation. It did work beautifully on my Win98 machine and,for the most part, I find it far better than '98 and far far far better than Me."
4,Scarily Good,"As someone who has excoriated Microsoft loud and long for crummy, duct-tape-&-baling-wire, *non*-""innovative"" software, I must confess in all honesty that Redmond has finally produced an OS I must grudgingly admire. I installed a pre-release version back in September on my Dell desktop and my Dell laptop, and now I've ""upgraded"" to the final release. Bottom line: --does not crash (yikes!); --recognizes and correctly configures hardware automatically at install; --networks and plays well with friends; --very strong computer management capabilities.Caveats: 1. Do not try to ""upgrade"" from Win98 or NT4.0; do a clean reformat and install. 2. If you play a lot of games or use any 16-bit app's, take a pass on Win2000.In sum, 20 years later Microsoft may have finally produced an OS worthy of the name; now we must only hope that the 'Net makes them increasingly irrelevant, or they'll continue to be a menace to their industry and, I believe, our society.""Still dual-booting Linux...."""
3,"Great OS, but HIGHLY over-priced...","It is unbelievable to me that Microsoft would charge so much for an upgrade version. The full version isn't much more expensive, so it seems like they aren't giving those of us who have bought a previous version much of a break. The operating system is great, much more stable and faster than anything I've seen Microsoft put out before. Major problems that I have seen so far is with compatibility with hardware, but I'm sure those issues will be cleared up in time as new drivers are released.Windows 2000 would ordinarily be very much deserving of 5 stars, but the outragous price tag brings that rating down. I wonder if they realize that they are actually promoting piracy of their products. Those who can't afford to, or don't want to, spend $200 could just borrow it from a friend and burn it to a blank CD that costs less than $1. Even Apple, with their historically high prices, only charge $89 for their latest OS."
4,Good but not great.,"Having grown accustomed to J.E. Gardiner's splendid rendition of this work with the Monteverdi Choir and Orchestra on the Erato label, I must disagree with the other reviewer here and weigh in with a lesser rating for Christophers and his ensemble. The tempi are comparatively breakneck at times, and the soloists generally aren't anywhere near the former's qualitative level. Yes, The Sixteen does avoid the common pitfall of taking the final chorus too slowly, but the recording overall fails to match both Gardiner and Parrott's performances in my book. In short, it's good but definitely not great"
2,Typos and information that's way too basic.,Whoever edited and proofread this book should be shot. There are all sorts of errors from the tests to the chapter text. And don't even try the software. It looks like it was written by an elemtary school student. If it wasn't for the transcender exams I'd have NEVER passed the actual test (which I did). Look elsewhere.
3,"To the point, but not 100% accurate","The book provided a lot of useful information in a concise, easy to read (at least easier than any other '95 prep book) format. The test questions were frustratingly buggy, however, which seems to be par for the course in this series. The end result, though, was I passed."
3,"It's good for what it is, but it isn't all that","I dig vampire novels. So when I saw the shadow saga I just had to have it. I enjoyed the second one because I thought the idea of a shadow justice system was cool. And all in all it was a good story but I think the characters were just a little too invincible. It's kind o' hard to relate to something that can't, under any circumstances, die. But like I said, it was still a cool story."
3,"Peter returns to help ""save the world"" from the vampires.",I really enjoyed the first and second books of this series. I was really disappointed with the last.
5,The book that has changed the ways of vampires forever,"im am usually one who just reads magic type books(elves wizards ect.) but these books have changed my mind about vampires forever. i loved the way that Golden used real like people that had become vampires. i am a christian and i enjoyed the way that he used jesus. it was odd but i still enjoyed it :) Golden totally changed all the boundries for vampires. from sunlight to crosses, but not only did he change them but he explained how. the way that golden wrote this made you feel every thing that the characters did. and i have totally fallen in love with Peter Octavian (would be nice to see him in another book) in short i would advise everyone who has an open mind about vampires or wants to see them catch up with the times to read these books."
4,A Page Turner of the First Order,"Christopher Golden's Shadow Saga is a definite page turner. It catches the readers attentions and runs with it never letting it get away. While the series does have a few faults (he kills off a lot of main characters) it is still extremely fascinating. In fact, I think that the authors unpredictablity leads to an even more interesting read. If you like mystery and original tales this a great book to read. Beware of the violence though. It can get pretty gruesome. It is a wonderful book about vampires in today's world."
4,A Sequel That Rocks!!,This is up there with The Necroscope series. Now I don't miss Brian Lumley as bad as I did.Now he has serious competition. A must read.
4,Pretty good....for a sequel,"Its a sequel, come on folks, how good can a sequel be? Of course the first one was better, but this one answers a lot of questions and is a pretty good book. The initial shock of the vampires and their ways are gone, but saga continues, trying to keep the reader still entertained by what the vamps really are. All in all, It was a pretty good follow up."
1,REALLY??? My order arrived broken as well!,"Similar to the previous customer's review, my bulb replacement arrived broken as well. The package contained no bubble wrap and had one small (very small) piece of newspaper in the box which served no purpose given the larger size of the container. The bulb arrived in millions of pieces...literally. Extremely disappointed!"
4,An Analysis of Changing Ideals of Beauty,"Hollander brings an art historian's eye to this survey of the history of Western European costume. Her interest lies less in historical detail than in the ways in which the governing esthetic of what makes a man handsome, or a woman beautiful, has changed over time and in how those changes have been reflected in costume and art. Occasionally, Hollander badgers the reader with a personal theory that is not adequately supported by the information she provides in the text, but most of the book is informative and thought-provoking. If you already have a general knowledge of historic costume, you will find much to interest you in Hollander's book."
5,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this ball!","I am so glad that I purchased this toning ball by Danskin. When I went to my local Sportsmart and Target, I found balls that were the same weight, however, they were much larger, cumbersome and more awkward to handle. Also, most of the balls found in the stores feel like a basketball- very rough to touch. This ball is about half the size of your normal 8lb. weighted ball, it is smooth and easy to palm because of it's ""squishy"" outer surface. I would highly recommend this ball to anyone who needs a toning ball, especially if you are going to buy the ""Ultimate New York Body Plan"" DVD."
5,best for core and ab training,I bought this when I started by core strengthening classes at our local fitness center. I did not like the hard balls they have avail. This one is awesome. Not only is it a pretty color (important for women!). It is filled with a sand type of material that makes it easier to grip than the heavier more solid balls. According to my friend's husband who is a physical therapist these types of balls are better than more solid balls for your joints. I highly reccomend this product!
5,I take it to work,"take a break and play ball with your friends at work. you don't have to worry about it flying all over the place, it just doesn't work that way. seems realy funky at first like a flat tire. but you will definitely enjoy this toy!"
1,Sales pitch! Learned nothing!,"This video is nothing more than a sales pitch! Don't waste money on this video. You will learn nothing more than how great Amy ""trainers"" training is. Majority of the video does not show you how to work with your dog / puppy. You are better off reading a book or watch Ceasar Millan ""dog whisperer"" series."
5,New dimension in understanding China,"After reading The World Is Flat, I have become much more aware of how important it is to recognize and understand other major economies beyond our own and how they affect us -- our work, our thinking and planning, and what our own future will be like. Clearly, understanding the culture of a people is seminal to understanding how their systems work and how they may be likely to evolve, affecting us. China's New Culture of Cool is definitely an important addition to that particular bookshelf of knowledge. The images are tantalizing, too."
4,China is changing fast,"Author discusses changes in young people's lifestyle over past decade in the big cities of China. I have seen a lot of these changes myself during recent trips over past 4-5 years . Groups of young people in China & here(U.S.) are very similar. The book reviews these advances through the themes of clothing,travel,music and other topics that young people have in common"
4,Good Listening!,"This 2002 Ripple Effect CD is a great music listen. The title cut is smooth and easy to listen to. The Celebracion cut features Nathan's wife Karen on violin. Check it out! I think Nathan's 2000 Forward Motion CD is also FANtastic. Features the sax of Gerald Albright and a special cut, Tu Vendras with Gerald playing bass! Really... check it out!"
3,"content is fine, but dvd authoring is poor","As others have posted here on the content and themes of the Little People video, I won't repeat what they have said. My 3yo loves them, and my 8 month old looks at the telly when they are on.I was disappointed they really did nothing more than place 2 episodes from the vhs onto a disk. Neither episode auto-starts when the disk is placed into a player. There is no option to play all of the adventures on the disk with one select. You can play the 5 from one episode, then have to go back to the main menu, and select the other episode to play the 5 adventures there. A minor gripe I know, but one that even the most basic dvd authoring software would have let them fix prior to production."
3,A little better than the original will probably lead to #3?,"Jodi Lyn O'Keefe was not bad as the villaness, and little more revealing, but not much, than Rose McGowan. Fairly predictable ending, leading up to the possibility of a part 3? (Hopefully, not.) Moderately suspenseful."
2,WOULD'VE BEEN BETTER IF ROSE MCGOWAN CAME BACK,"THIS TIME, DEBBIE STRONG [THIS TIME, BEING PLAYED BY JODI LYNN O KEEFE] BECOMES OBSESSED WITH A COLLEGE TEACHER. MOVIE'S QUITE OK TO WATCH SOMETIMES, BUT, I CAN'T DENY THE FACT THAT I DON'T LIKE THIS NEW GIRL. I REALLY THINK ROSE MCGOWAN DONE BETTER AND IF YOU WATCH THIS MOVIE IN ITS ENTIRETY, YOU'LL SEE WHY. BUT, AT LEAST IT WAS REMOTELY ENTERTAINING. I THINK IT'S AT LEAST WORTH 1 RENTAL. NOTHING MORE."
4,Great suspense,"A film with suspense in which the camara moved like the eyes ofthe audience, that take you into the plot. Sam (Jsu Garcia) as a mature teacher, that is serious about his profession and in his life is well established. In his performance he is full of conviction that even in the tone of his voice he shows how well he had handle this role. Jodi Lyn O'keefe as Debbie strong got her moments. Some of the other performances are interesting."
1,O'keefe Wasted on Idiotic Film,"Caught this film on HBO the other night, I'd never heard of JL O'Keefe. DAMN is she hot...I was blown away by her beauty. She's an ok actress that didn't really portray menace and anger all that well. But hey, I'm a guy...I'm thinking about dropping $10 on this just to check O'Keefe out again.To summarize:movie: WEAK (see other reviews for detail)O'Keefe: Incredibly Hot Babe (she should star in some better roles)"
1,deserves zero stars,"Easily one of the lamest straight to video films of all time. Even Ed Wood had a sense of humor. The laughs here are at the expense of the community college level actors, and whatever drunk they assigned to ""direct"" this abombination. The only future for these actors is in the adult video industry. They should all be ashamed of themselves."
2,Defective,"The sander worked for about 2 minutes then it died on me. BUT, returning it couldn't have been easier. Just had to click once then print out the return label. Take it to the post office and hand it over. The refund was timely."
5,Rethinking the musical,"Apart from the fact that the songlisting in the amazon page is entirely incorrect, this work breaks new ground for musical theatre. A musical it is not, opera it is not, but be prepared to be moved by the thrust of the true story of the star-crossed lovers and the emotion of their torment. For more information see www.fiddeslaw.com.au/ah"
5,good price,This was a good price for a standard office product. The company fulfillment was reliable and punctual. Would order again.
2,OK BOOK,"I THOUGHT IT WOULD AM FOR ALL GRADUATE STUDENTS, BUT IT SEEMS TO JUST FOCUS ON THE TRADITION GRADUATES WHO JUST FINISHED UNDERGRAD. IM 28, SO ITS A TOUGH SELL, BUT IT MAY BE OF GOOD USE TO SOMEONE YOUNGER"
4,A Great Mixture of Songs,"I had to listen to this cd a few times to fully appreciate its contents. Tompall's voice is as ever superb.There are a few tracks not to my taste but on the whole I love it. It's a mixture of a tender side to Tompall with 'Forever and Ever', 'True Love', 'When I Dream' along with the usual Tompall style 'The Rogue', 'Unwanted Outlaw'. I would recommend this cd - just sit back in a quiet room and enjoy Tompall's beautiful voice."
4,Splendid,"I'm probably one of Tompall's biggest fans in the world. I love everything he's done, but honestly this is not his absolute best album. However, if you're a Tompallfan just don't hesitate to get it..."
1,ambers?,"This has to be one of THE worst movies ever. It has absolutely no quality acting in it. My friend and I rented it because the cover said it was about raves, well, the closest thing to a rave seen in the movie is them going off into the woods and eating the amber off of the trees and getting all tripped out. It was horrible, this movie has made me despise Shannon Elizabeth, yet has allow some pretty good inside jokes with my friend."
1,And the review raves on!!!,"I was hoping the rating scale was in dog poops instead of stars so I could give this one 5 poops. I told my girlfriend I would cancel Netflix if she ever got anything like this again. Nothing made sense. Whatever this was about, it sure wasn't about raves, LA, or drug use at all. It was about a guy in a trailer saying random stuff. And sucking on tree sap in his trendy store (with no customers). The DJ's were never on the turntables, no character development, pointless changes in plot, no facts. The only thing good, is now I'm not afraid. Because I know I will never see anything worse."
1,"""Seamless"" is Senseless","The best thing about the movie is the cover of the box. ""Seamless"" is absolutely one of the worst films ever created. I watched about three minutes of it and turned it off immediately. Kentaro Seagal (YES, Steven Seagod's son) is in the movie and he doesn't make any sense. The rave started early for him. Shannon Elizabeth looked good as usual but in her first scene, a silly man was dancing to atrocious music. The opening credits showed a guy getting beat up outside of a club, then it cut to a boy stealing a woman's purse and then it cut to Shannon Elizabeth getting frustrated with the silly man. Incredibly bad."
2,Only thing positive about this film is the message,"The acting in this film was not very good...perhaps the best job was by the little kid that played Elmo. On another note, the story of uplifting through effort and hard work, and looking out for others is a very good positive message, it's just the methods used to convey and learn this message detract from the effort as a whole. Shannon Elizabeth was probably the main stability this film had, and the ending was somewhat predictable."
4,Jornada Heaven,"The HP Jornada 690 is outstanding for what it offers. I love the portablilty and compactness, yet do wish for a tad larger keyboard. It handles all the complex spreadsheets I threw at it with ease. Haven't tried the e-mail/net access yet."
5,Absolutely Great,"I have had the HP Jornada 690 for several months now. I havent seen any regrets for my purchase. I bought it because I like the idea of having a keyboard and i dont like the look of the Palm Pilots. This unit is a bit heavier than its previous versions, however you get so much more for your $. Its ability to connect to the internet and SYNC with your computer are Headache free to say the least. I previously owned a Compaq handheld, I have since found it a new home. I would recomend this unit to anyone interested in purchasing a Handheld PC. It is worth every bit of the money you spend on it."
3,"Good fragrance, poor cap","This is a pretty good cologne, it's light and fruity.The sprayer is horrible and barely works, it fell off the one I didn't buy from amazon."
1,Fragrance lasts about 1 minute,"I was excited to get this product only to find that the fragrance lasts for about a minute after you put it on. After one minute, the fragrance is gone. I wouldn't purchase this again."
4,"I own this Anne Kline watch, along with a Silver AK watch","this is a flashy watch that catches everyones eye with its great sparkle from the Swarovski Cystals, it truely is stunnuing. I get tons of compliments on my watch, I love it(the watch).Buy it you won't be sorry."
1,WORST FRYER EVER!,"This fryer only lasted 2 months, I only used it a few times. It is VERY cheaply made, the button to even open the top barely worked when I first used it. By my 3rd use, it took 5 minutes to get it open, then it wouldn't even heat up. Terrible! What a waste of money."
5,Sick and tender.,"Beautiful little songs baste roughly on a book by the great French writer Genet.Sad but immoral seaside tales about disease, prostitution and the meaningless life (and death) of sailors and fishermen. NOT for the squeamish. This CD deals with VD, rape and many other questionable things.Expect lots of bad language and shocking lyrics ... But still the songs are melodic, tender and thought provoking. A strong contrast between the lyrics and music makes it very entertaining and strangly beautiful.I especially like ""King Neptune""; it's about a 60 year old sailor who tells tall tales about mermaids, far off seas and the many prostitutes he's slept with.If you don't know of the Tiger Lillies. This isn't a bad place to start. A masterpiece in modern Cabaret.If you are looking for one of their ""cleaner"" albums try; ""A Gorey End"" or ""Shockheaded Peter"". If you want something a little more fun try; Ad Nauseum. But saying that, I think this is one of their best."
2,The ingredients in of the recipes is something I do notuse,Many of the ingredients in these recipes are things that I ordinarily would not use. I am disappointed that the calorie count has not been added to each recipe. If I had scanned this cookbook in a book store I definately would not have purchased it.
3,Fat free not to be confused with cholesterol free,"This book has some decent flavorful recipes but should not be confused with cholesterol-free cooking. It is far from that. It often uses buttermilk, lobster, shrimp and meats."
5,Barry Levinson's Genius work,"Every scene in Avalon seems to have a deeper meaning. A classic, heartwrenching story about immigration and how families can drift apart. How many millions of us living in America have a similar tale?Awesome musical score by Randy Newman, too!Michael Locker MD"
1,Terrible movie,"I am a 76-year-old Jew who grew up in East Baltimore, surrounded by Eastern European Jewish immigrants. Avalon depicted almost none of the typically Jewish experiences I recall from my youth: the seder at my great grandfather's table, the after school lessons at the Baltimore Talmud Torah, Yum Kipur services at the synagogue just up Baltimore Street from by grandmother's house, my bar mitzvah, etc., etc. Where was the Jewishness I expected to see? Not in this noisy, confusing chazerai!"
5,Avalon,"Tremendous storyline. Good acting overall. If families want to know what causes problems in the family unit, this is one to see. Excellent movie---one for the ages."
4,Bittersweet commentary on family life in America,"Every time I see this movie, the last 20 minutes or so depress the hell out of me and it makes me nostalgic for an earlier time in which I didn't even live. The closeness of the family, the way kids, parents and grandparents all shared the household, the family talks in the living room...it's just such a departure from the way families exist today, everyone in another city, if not another state. Everyone zoning out in front of the tv. It's a downer, but it's so true! The mood and look of the film are beautiful to watch. It's a thoughtful film worth catching."
5,Very dope german trance,"Pascal is young and very talented; this is alot better than what I've heard from all of the albums from ICU, including Kimball.I cant wait to hear his next adventure..He seems to have a rawness that makes everything sound much better..I like to hear a DJ mix records, not stand behind a editing wheel and have the machine do it for them."
2,ICU Trance...,"There is a lot better trance out there if that is what you are looking for... Try any of the Gatecrasher cd sets or the Cream cd sets... This compilation is descent, but not great... Kimball Collins first CD with ICU i think is probobly the most classic old skool Anthem Trance CD ever created... Even though i dont listen to trance much, the first ICU was by far the best, none can compair, GT 2000 is not there..."
4,A good cd with a single exception,"I purchased this cd directly after after purchasing Generation Trance 2000 Episode 0.1 because i liked that one so well. While this CD and tracks have the same feel as Episode 0.1 I just cannot stand Track 5 - Two Mind - The Race. It only bothers me because all of the other tracks on this cd are so enjoyable that that single track quite literally ruins the cd for me and it's such a shame because with exception to track 5 i actually like this cd better than Episode 0.1. Still a must buy in my opinion, i just had to edit out track 5 to truly love this cd."
4,Great Trance,"This is a great cd. I bought this one after episode 01. The only reason I'm giving it a 4 star is because episode 01 was just that epically good. So this one, even though it pales in comparison is still leagues better than a lot of other trance...trance core cds.Great choice of tracks, only a couple are mixed kinda sloppy but can be forgiven...otherwise is a great cd but i'd buy this one before episode 01 otherwise this one may let you down a bit...but certainly buy this one before any other trance/trancecore comps."
4,Not quite as good as Vol 1 but better than Vol 3,"I think I gave the 1st volume of this series 4+ stars. Vol 2 here isn't as good as Vol 1, but only by a little bit -- especially if you like Ayla as much as I do; two songs by them on here. I also like the mix of Freezer's ""Just Follow"" (down the road with you...) here -- can't say I'd heard it before. Generally the album is solid from start to finish. It's just not outstanding, so I give it 3 1/2 - 4 stars. If you liked Vol 1 by all means get Vol 2 (but maybe skip Vol 3) especially if you want something a little mellower than Vol 1."
2,very mediocre,"I'll make it brief. Whereas Episode 1 of this series (mixed by Kimball Collins) truly rocked, this one pales in comparison. It's slower and more relaxed. Besides the tempo being rather slow, DJ Pascal Dolle also makes some mixing errors on this one and cuts the tracks very short, making the whole mix about 60 minutes. The only good track is Anastasia - Join Me (3). Do NOT waste your money on this volume; either get Episode 1 (best) or 3 (good)."
3,What does the last 18 seconds reveal?,"Picked up on a whim and read at a gallop, this was an enjoyable escapist read. I understand that this is Mr Shuman's first novel and I look forward to his next one.For me, this is a novel that doesn't bear close dissection. Few of the elements are original, and the ability to see the last 18 seconds of a dead person's life is not a premise that would usually appeal to me at all. But there is something in the way that Mr Shuman combined the elements of this story that kept my interest entirely in the few hours it took me to read it. A psychological thriller with some potentially interesting characters amongst the stereotypes.Well worth reading, and I'll definitely read the next one.Jennifer Cameron-Smith"
3,I expected more.,"After hearing all the reviews for this book I honestly expected better. The book either needed to be shortened or lengthened. There were too many characters involved to keep the book down to just around 300 pages so either some needed to go or a couple hundred more pages should be added so that introducing new characters wasn't so epileptic. When I read it I kept thinking, ""this should be a movie instead."" I could see the potential for a movie where static one-dimensional characters are okay to have but in books I like for my characters to have more . . . character."
5,addictive,"I have never read a book from this author before.. Ok so this is his first book .. BUT i am so happy to have found him .. WOW he is good first book is so additing!! My daighter saw the book and lent it to me , we read like its food for us.. I have to say this was soooo amazingly good , I kept thinking when am i going to get bored and have to put it down .. Instead i was finding ways to hide and just get my nose between the pages!! I Love Sherry and there will be more of her .. I CAN'T WAIT!! Bring on more !! Thankyou George! Sue L."
4,Love the concept!,"I absolutely love this concept (of seeing the last 18 seconds of a person's life). What a fresh idea. The rest of the book was pretty average, but this concept is what's giving it the 4 stars in my book. I can't bear to read yet another serial killer novel, but this new spin on the genre helped it out. I hope to read more psychic crime thrillers like this one."
3,"Decent read, a little trying and violent","I don't normally read detective stories and the like, but when I saw a positive review for 18 Seconds in the Washington Post, I decided to give it a try. Overall, it was a pretty good novel, and it kept me interested for most of the story. I was somewhat turned off by the level of violence, but I suppose it shouldn't come as a surprise considering it's the story of a serial killer. Sherry, the heroine who can see the last 18 seconds of a dead person's life, was well-written, although I was definitely left feeling like the author didn't spend enough time on her compared to the other characters. Perhaps this is just to expand on her in later novels.For people who like crime and detective fiction, I would probably recommend this. For those who don't usually read that sort of thing, I don't know that I would. It was good but didn't leave a lasting impression for me."
5,Excellent,"I have read Grisham and Koontz for years.. while in an airport and without a book.. I quickly grabbed this one. It captivated me from the first chapter and held my interest throughout. I normally skim a little when reading, but not with this one. I wanted to make sure I read every word.Excellent!! A must read! I can't wait to read his next book."
3,"Good for English study, but insufficient for the TOEFL test","This book contains several useful ways to abound English vocabulary. BUT,vocabulary questions in the TOFEL test are all synonom questions,and most of those in the test are academic words rather than daily-life words. The words in this book seems a bit far from toefl questions. If you have only short time left for preparing toefl, I would recommend other directly-toefl-related vocabulary books like the one from Barron's."
4,Good Operating System,"I've been using the Beta releases of Win2000 Professional for about 2 months. I installed it on a laptop that used to have NT. The installation took a long time, but went very smoothly. Setup found and configured all of my components for me. Even a PC card that it took me half a day to set up under NT! Since then my system has run very well, the interface is intuitive, and it's easy to figure out how to set things up if you are familiar with NT and 95. My only complaint is that just about everything is done in wizards, and although this way gives you a little more information, it's a little slower to set things up if you already know what you are doing."
5,Microsoft Windows 2000 Professional,"This operating system is the best I've had so far. I used Microsoft over the years and this has to be the best. No more blue screens, no more nothing works and no more just plain unhappiness. The security is the best. You can configure this operating system just the way you want it. There is an upgrade that is on the Microsoft site and it is easy to install."
3,Read this if your family will be using this at home,This software is no fun for families who share the same computer. My husband has the administrative account and the kids and I can not play any of the pc games labeled windows 2000 compatible unless we are signed in under his account or unless he gives our accounts FULL administrative privileges. Of course the kids can not have FULL administrative privileges so they pretty much never get to play any pc games. Their new ones don't work and their old windows 98 compatible games can't be used either. My kids and I think this OS stinks for that reason.IF you don't have the family dilemma then Windows 2000 Professional is great; MUCH better than Windows 98.
3,It crashed mine... but only once.,"And the damn thing is DOG slow if you have anything less than the latest.And it has 65,000 *KNOWN* bugs. I don't know. Maybe it's just me.But, the final build does seem to be DAMN stable. It makes for a heck of a word processor (LOL!).newt"
2,More of the same,"Yes. Is more stable than windows 98, but is the same thing as Windows NT 4.0. Win 2000 consumes a lot of resources, it made my computer slower, and of course, if I want to keep running Win 2000, I have to buy a brand new PC. .I switched back to Windows NT 4.0 after test Win2000 for a few weeks. Windows NT 4.0 is very stable and runs fine for me. I better wait until I save some money for my next PC to use this new version of NT."
1,Windows Getting Better & Milenium and 2000 were the worst ideas,"You actually think that windows2000 is stable and the XPs aren't? That is talking backwards. It is the other way around. I have used the XPs for 4 years and they have never crashed on me, but Millenium and 2000 have been always a hassle to my family and friends. There is nothing stable about either of those two. Maybe it is because I am a programmer, maybe not, but I do know this, what you are saying is wrong. The GUI in XP can be changed back to the original 95, 98, Millenium, and 2000 GUI so it doesn't take up extra resources. Have you tried doing that yet? Millenium and 2000 were not the successors of 98 2nd and WinNT 4.0 either; they were temps until the ""true"" successors, the ""XPs"", came out. If you believe they were the successors, then you need to do more homework on the subject, and using Microsoft as a refference is useless because they will tell you what ever they want you to know, whether lie or not."
1,Not worth it ....,"I am a web designer of 3 years , and I have never seen such awful grainy looking graphics in my life. I was so shocked when I saw it on my father's computer that I vowed never to install it. It takes way too much time to get up and running with it. Why buy this when you can install 98 and be online within a day? You need to install everything seperately. What happens if you need to do a restore? Microsoft can keep this one. Id rather use 98 or NT."
1,Windows 2000,I do not have the cd code to use this product!I sent a e-mail to you but I have not seen a response.Please help me with this problem.Gene LeVan
5,WOW,"It is awesome! I am speechless. Microsoft does it again. WIN2k is very stable and if you mess up your computer a lot like I do(I like to mess with the settings), it doesnt make you reboot, you'll be fine. I like the way in the installation process it tells you possible problems with some hardware devices!"
4,ok for home user-but....,"Ok, if you're a home user and 1)don't play alot,if any games and 2)are familar with NT-then upgrading to win2k is not a bad idea-I myself got sick of win98 and all of its glorious shortcomings and crash ability-so I switched to NT and found it much more reliable. But don't make the switch unless you really understand your computer and are familiar with setting up and working with NT-2k is easier to configure than NT, but it's still not an OS for average 98 users-IE gamers and surfers-if you fall into these catagories avoid win2k, wait for WinMillenium-it should be out soon."
1,This is the worst version of Windows yet.,"I used 98 SE happily, then stepped up to this and had 2 crashes within 3 months. My system flew with 98 SE, now crawls with 2000 Pro. I then tried 2000 Server...big mistake. This isn't as bad as Server, and I have only used ME a few times, but I'd stick to 98 SE for home use and NT for the office. I have an 850 Mhz Pentium III with 256 MB of Ram, and I wasn't pleased. My machine was very bogged down, and I wound up wasting money on a copy of Pro, (because it was 'new') and put 98 SE back on my system. I know all of you certification chasers out there want this to help review your braindumps, but it's not worth it. ..."
5,LINUX's DAYS ARE NUMBERED!,"This OS is by far the best, most stable operating system i haveseen. It is even friendlier than win98 and far more than linux. Buythis Os and you'll sleep better. you'll do yourselfe a BIG favor ifyou buy Windows 2000! END"
2,Upgrade to XP,"This program is not compatible with anything! It is easy to get around and use but I have had numerous problems finding printers, programs and cameras that work with this program."
2,Microsoft finally comes up with an adequate product...,"Windows 2000 is a good choice overall. I'm not going to go into details, some of the other much-less computer savvy reviewers (which is all but one or two) have already spewed their deal of buzzwords about the fearures at you. And I'll agree this is not as bad as XP or every other MS product for that matter, that doesn't mean it's good. It is still bloated, takes up far too much HD space, uses .exe executable compression schemes (which [stink]), and provide bad support in general. It's adequate I suppose for some. But i'll stick to open-source thank you ..."
5,Windows 2000 Professional user,"Love it! Works great with Windows 2003 Server. Great for home & professional use. You can limit a user, enable a guest account. I love it for Desktop PCs. Overall it gets done what I want it to. My Central Processing Unit (CPU) is running at 400MHz. Seems fast like a brand-new computer!!! If you don't have it, I would highly recommend getting it! Although it requires at least 64MB of RAM."
4,yeah...,"ive been running the release version of win2k for about 2 months, and its very stable. there are several bugs in it however. there is no opengl support by default (at least for my v770 there wasnt) and you actually have to install beta drivers to get the card to work at all. driver support is non-existant. so if you want to run an os with little support, but good reliability, run unix =]"
4,Best Operating System Yet,"When you start Windows 2000, you immediately get the feel that Microsoft has put a lot of work into Windows 2000. After running Windows NT 4, Windows 98, AND Windows ME (pre-release), I was pleased to find an operating system that didn't crash once an hour (NT 4 excluded).If you're running Windows 98 or Windows 95, I would definatly suggest you to consider upgrading your system to 2000. But, be sure your system can handle it. You'll need AT LEAST 64 MB of RAM, I'd suggest 128 at minimum, 256 is ideal. If you're running Windows NT 4, you won't see as big as an improvement.It still has some issues with compatibility, and a few things the Microsoft needs to tweak, but the NT line has taken a giant step up this time. I can't wait for Windows Whistler Final(A.K.A. Windows NT 5.1, Windows.NET 1.0, Windows 2001), the beta looks promising."
5,Microsoft gets it right this time,"In March, 2000, I bought a Compaq computer with Windows 98-SE preinstalled. It worked fine for about a month. Then the crashes and blue screens of death started to rear their ugly heads. Finally, in November, I decided to install Windows 2000. Since I installed this operating system and got my hardware working with the new operating system, I have not had ANY CRASHES. If an application starts generating errors, the system will close it without freezing up. My cable internet connection is a lot faster with Windows 2000. For installation, I would strongly recommend erasing the hard drive and installing a clean copy of Win 2000, rather than ""upgrading."" I would not only recommend this operating system for business users, but also for home users."
2,"I would not recommend this OS, stick with Win 98SE","This is the quirkest OS I have ever used. It requires to much input for my liking and the passwords are a pain in the neck on the network, I know it is for security, but it still stinks. On one computer the OS would not even load, I spent over 2 days on the phone with Microsoft and another week via email just trying to get the stupid thing loaded, Microsoft finally gave up and gave me the address to return it directly to them for a refund."
1,Windows 2000 is bug infested,"Well only the companies that MS paid to talk well about theiroperating system are telling that it is stable and it is good. Firstof all after the upgrade your hardware components might not work atall due that you current drivers don't work with the new driver format of Windows 2000. Also you need to have a super PC if you want to run it smootly 256 MB of RAM and get a Pentium III with over 500 Mhz. This is a link to an article that MS itself is telling that the product still has over 63,000 known bugs, and they will try to fix it for a future release or SP1.MSNBC is telling this..the same guys from Microsoft. Microsoft has digged it's own grave. They failed once again to give you a reliable OS. Don't waste your money"
1,Poor Service,I wouldn't buy anything from this seller at any time they canceled my order without any cause so people like that I wouldn't deal with at any time ever again.
1,"Received it, used the Product Key that came with it, did not work",Called Microsoft and was told that this version was from another company and would have to purchase another Product Key
3,Windows 2000,"The product came on time and nicely packaged. Though I had LOTS of trouble installing it. When I finally got it to work, none of my PC games were working. Apparently I had to update my Video Card. Also I had lots of trouble getting connected to the internet. Luckily I easily resolved all the problems and would have rated this great 5 stars if it wasn't for the problems. I enjoyed how you can find great Internet Browsers that supported Windows 2000. Still there was only a little difference from my windows 98SE."
5,Beautiful for a beach wedding,We used these parasols in lieu of very expensive floral bouquets at an island resort wedding. They were in great shape even after a trip to an island destination and they were really beautiful in the pictures propped up on the beach. They made a great prop! The resort photographer asked to keep them. They are affordable and light weight and large enough to decorate. I got three in different colors and they were actually on par/ better than in the photos here.
4,"Great, but not the same antique finish as shown in the picture","I expected the color to be lighter on the highspots - antiqued - but they are just solid color. Still pretty. The size of these ramekins are perfect for chicken pot pies! Probably too big/tall for an individual custard, creme brulee... Still, I'm not going to return them."
4,sorrento ramekins,The ramekins were great but one was brokrn due to inadequate packaging also not marked fragile!
2,"Ramekins great, PACKING HORRIBLE! BROKEN","I purchased 2 sets of 4 ramekins. The Sorrento ramekins were as pictured, EXCEPT:One set of 4 came packaged properly. In the second box, the 4 ramekinswere loose, rolling around and BARELY bubblewrapped in a cardboard box that was too large for the items. VERY VERY disappointed in the packing and shipping. There was no way that the vendor could expect to have the one set delivered and in one piece."
3,Book review,Interesting book but probably would not have purchased if it weren't for book club. A lot of name dropping. OK.
5,Good addition to my workout tools,This ball is easy to grip with both my hands and knees and it doesn't roll away when not in use. It is much more comfortable to do reverse crunchs with this instead of a dumbell between my knees!
3,Pennsylvania German Marriages,"This book contains many thousands of names of brides, grooms and witnesses to marriages in Pennsylvania German churches. If you find the ancestor you were looking for, it is like finding a pot of gold at the end of a rainbow for the genealogist. However, since it is a reference book, the reader is dependent on the index to locate these names. Unfortunately, I found several names listed in the index that were not on the page listed, and I have no idea whether the page is wrong or if the entry of marriage was omitted entirely. Unless I want to read the book, from cover to cover--all 817 pages, then I have no way of locating these entries if they exist. It is disappointing to me that little or no proofreading was done in preparing this book for publication."
5,Perfect Shot,"This little book is very informative and gives descriptions of the animal, it's habits, size & location. Each animal covered has a side view and the next page shows the location of the vitals. This is my second copy, it's so small I lost the first!"
3,15 Pills A Day. That's alot.,"This lady on my job has recently lost a lot of weight and I asked her what she was doing. She said she was taking these pills and hadn't done anything else differently.Since they seemed natural I figured I would give them a try. Well they didn't do anything. HOWEVER, I did not take the recommended doses. You're suppose to take 15 tablets a day. I was scared to take that many tablets not knowing the effects so I only took 2 a day and really saw no effect.One thing thing the lady on my job mentioned was they keep you VERY REGULAR and she said it as a warning.Since I didn't see any results with the two I was taking I stopped taking them. I still have about 1/4 of the package left. I take them every now and then just so I don't waste them. ."
5,Sun Chlorella regime,Really helps improve general well being!Few cases I know of:1) Immensely helped recovery from surgery2) Helped control the early onset of white hair3) Appears to have improve the quality of skin
1,suspected to be counterfeit,This was the third batch of chlorella tablets I purchased. I had a very positive experience with respect to the quality and effectiveness of previous batches. The previous purchases were 500mg. I am truly disappointed with this particular product as it is totally ineffective. I also noticed that the tablet color is somewhat lighter than the 500 mg tablets which are distinctly dark green. I am returning the product and suspecting it to be counterfeit.
3,List the ingredients!,I ordered this product on the recommendation of my oncologist. I was eager to try it. When it arrived I realized that it had soy in it. I am very allergic to soy. A listing of the ingredients would have helped me make the decision to buy or not. Needless to say the product was useless for me.
2,Defective product,"I bought this cast protector for my 14 year old son who had a short arm plaster cast. While the protector was made of a durable vinyl material, it was so strongly adhered to itself that I had great difficulty separating the two sides. As a result, the material tore just above the minimal length required to cover his cast, so we cut it off and made do. After a few days, we gave up and used a small plastic trash bag. The velcro fastener was made well and we continued to use it."
3,More serious then for fun questions,"I bought this book in hopes of having fun conversations with my husband. However, this book is more of the serious ""What are your hopes and dreams"" type of questions. And there's nothing wrong with that, if that's why you're looking for. This book will help you get to know the more serious questions that you'd like to know about your spouse."
5,ON-OFF at twist of handle,"On-Off with twist of bottom of handle holding button for momentary light. This flashlight is built well. Not bright enough to reflect light off of nearby objects, but lights that which is near."
5,good product. very useful in hard to light areas,"I use this to look inside musical instruments, mainly bass violin. I use the shorter 7 inch version to look into smaller places/ instruments. I am glad I have both. Anyway, this is very very useful and well worth the money. The flexible neck on the light is stiff enough that it retains its form for as long as you need. It's bright enough for most apps. I agree with other reviewers that the AAAA batteries are hard to find, but oh well.This product is well made, and I expect it to last a long time. The light can be turned on with a pen-type push button (intermittent), or you can screw it on like a mag-lite.I recommend."
2,the slotted nozzle,"the plastic cover is cracked. I can send a picture by email if nessesaireminor incident, I do not want to exchange"
4,Nice little light,"I looked this product over closely. I like it, the light and flexible shaft seem quality and the main body is solid.The light is bright enough and I think with responsible use it will last a while. It's a good piece for that close in worklike looking in my rifle bores !!Thanks,William"
1,Useless,I should have known better. You get what you paid for. Was looking for medical tweezers to take care of wounds. The tweezers at Walgreen are short as they are meant for eye brows. So I figure these would be longer (as they are medical tweezers) at a very reasonable price.They are shorter than the brow tweezer by 3/4 inch! poor quality. So I now use the brow tweezers instead.Not worth returning. They just went into the trash can instead. Don't buy.
4,A fine collection of classic Spanish guitar,"This CD is highly recommended for the newcomer to Spanish guitar, or for the person who is rounding out their collection of world music. It contains pieces that will seem familiar to the casual listener; and, as such, is well worth the money. For more serious collectors of the genre, it may seem a bit trite. The purist, however, might want to give it a try the next time they make a CD purchase. (It's cheap, toss it in! Also, don't miss ""Classic Spanish Guitar, Volume One."")"
5,Worked great.,Bought it for a costume (Candle Jack) but ended up using them to do demo work at home after the hurricane. Fantastic.
4,book,"I ordered a copy of ""Harm's Way,"" the book on which the movie ""In Harm's Way"" is based. I had looked far and wide for the book and found it only on Amazon. The book arrived in a timely fashion and was in great condition, especially considering its age."
3,Pretty good,This is a fair software. I needed it for amoritization and was hoping for a clearer picture with principal only payments. I am not at all disappointed with the schedules that are included and I am glad I purchased this software. bj
1,NOT worth the paper in written on,"SOOO misinformed, I read a more thought provoking statement on a cereal box."
1,'O M L E T T E' - tosser,Children: The opinion of any individual incapable of spelling correctly the word 'omlette' is to be considered null and void.
4,"Good Book, overpriced",Overpriced considering how common the book is and how small it is. This book will teach you everything you never learned about communism.
4,The failures and oceans of blood caused by Communism.,"Pipes does a bang up job of placing Communism as a brutal system. As a conservative myself, I find his analysis not always fair. Pipes makes the comparison that Lenin was worse than Stalin, and his primary motives were revenge when he first revolted against the Tsarist system. I think some historians would find some fault with this analysis. I believe Lenin was less brutal than Stalin. Also his comments about the overthrow of Allende suggest that the Armed Forces coup de etat was legitimate. WOW, that is certainly a stretch. His analysis on Castro and Mao were on target.This is a very readable summary of communism. I would just warn the reader that some of views of Professor Pipes are very conservative, and may not be credible to those who are interested in a even handed approach to history."
2,Not a reliable resource,"While this book may not contain a single factual error (I doubt it), one would not know because almost nothing is cited. There are almost NO citations in this book, and the author makes plenty of claims that leave you wondering ""where did he get that information?"". While the book is well written and entertaining, it does tend to lean toward the left/ pro-communist view, further bringing into question the source of his credibility. If you want to have an opinion, fine, but don't make-believe your opinions are facts. Cite the facts!"
3,Must reread again.,"I did not get much out of this book the first timearound. Mr. Pipes standards as an author were not met, as in hisfirst book. So, I won't give it a buy rating, but I will read it again.Jimmy"
2,Thorough but bias,"i have read Pipe's work on the russian revolution and find him to be factually sufficient however he makes extremely subjective conclusions...his analysis is no more or less true than that of a post-glasnost historian, a point of view i find more malleable and thus agreeable."
1,the teen who was attacked by some guy from vermont,"this is just a response-i never justified communism in my review-never said that socialism would work if we had followed what marx and trotsky said. i am NOT a commie-i am reading Capital and i have many many problems with it- like the entire labor theory of valuei respect human rights and this is my other big problem with lenin and trotsky, they were too brutal-far too brutal.i merely pointed out that what pipes depicts is not communism, but Stalinism. this doesnt justify communism in any way.unlike you, ive decided to study both sides of the arguement rather than spend my time buying into the idealism of youth and blindly following leftist ideology, only to ""chuckle"" at myself later."
3,I am one of the actors in the movie,"And I have to admit it is not the best movie I have ever seen, and the pacing is not that great; but I really did laugh out loud quite a few times, and the actors (and I 'm not saying this just because I am one) are really solid. So that counts for something!"
1,Not very good at all,"This product first of all, has no manual or anything. I was actually surprised because it was missing this. I pluged it into my pc and the mic didnt work at all. Their site is not very detailed and does not even say anything in their Faq. It doesnt even mention ANYTHING about the system requirements. This product is horible!"
1,"Not a product review, per se","This is not a product review, but instead a condemnation of the listing.It's impossible to tell:* what kind of device (telephone, cellphone, PC, PowerPC Macintosh?) this unit connects with* Or how it connects? Does it have a 2.5 mm plug or a 3.5 mm plug? Or does it have 2 plugs for use with a computer?Poor. Very poor."
5,The book knocked me out!,"While Payne's book does not fit the mold of mainstream pop culture fiction, readers would be doing themselves a disservice by missing this sometimes harrowing, often touching, and always interesting book. The Miles family does indeed take on a life of its own, and Payne finds a way to redeem what seems like a family that is all but lost. I defy even one reader not to find a ""family member"" here that rings familiar. I cried tears of joy at the tender moments experienced by the characters who sorely needed them. I read the book in one sitting as I could not put it down."
5,A book with characters that have fascinating voices.,"The characters are full of personality; bizarre, sometimes stubborn, always real individuals. I like how the author is able to bring to life so many different and interesting characters in a seemingly effortless way. I think that's the real mark of a writer's creativity: to make the difficult appear easy and somehow natural. The author Johnny Payne possesses this special creativity. I read the book in one afternoon and will re-read it. Payne packs in a lot of substance in this novel and I think a re-reading will help me enjoy and understand the novel better. A beautifully crafted piece of fiction. I give it the highest mark."
2,Hospitality Accounting - Nothing specific to Hopsitality Industry,This book is pricey and comes up on top of the stack when you search in Google or Amazon.This book basically explains Accounting in general but there is nothing specific to Hospitality industry. For example what type of accounting information is maintained in a Property (Hotel) and what type of accounting information is maintained in back office ERP etc.I'm still searching for a better book.
3,Bought it for school,"Very cheap. Big book. I bought the hard cover edition and turns out that they sold it, cheaper than the soft back."
1,many innacuracies,"there are too many errors and fantasies here....e.g. the V1 had a 1870 lb warhead, the V2 a 2150 lb warhead, not 500lb."
5,fun!,"This magnetic poetry kit inspires my little one so much! im ready to try some of the others, there seems to be one for everyone. I thank the creators for acting on this idea!"
2,CYMA MP7 Rifle,"This gun looks good in the picture, and it finally comes and i get all excited.. It sucks. all the attachments it came with are o.k but the trashy gun that came along with it wasn't good. when u take off the silencer, theres a little nub of orange plastic sticking off and its like a centimetetr long, so the gun only looks good when the slencer is on it. theres no xtra barrel on it. its made of strong heavy plastic and theres no extendable stock. it fires 20ft and my friend shot me in the face with it and i could bairly feel it.(from like 5ft away)it makes a loud dinging noise after fired like the spring is smacking the gun. it only holds like 8bbs. within the two weeks i had it, it broke. plastic broke off of it inside because of the spring smacking around and it blocked the passage of the bb. so i threw it out. if u want a good gun, search mk23 navy seal pistol (link)---->MK23 Navy Seal Spring Pistol Airsoft Gun"
2,"Looks cool, but doesn't work long.","My son was so excited to get this, it looked great out of the box and has lots of neat accessories. Unfortunately, it quit working after about 2 hours of play. I wasn't too surprised, since we've had similar experiences with other inexpensive airsoft guns. But my son was still disappointed."
2,"Awesome looking gun, sucky performance","First off, do not buy this gun unless you plan to just have backyard skirmishes only. My reasons for this are few, but persuasive.-No hop up. Hop up is a mechanism that puts a spin on the BB to make it fly farther and more accurate. This gun shoots a .12 BB 10-50 feet. UNRELIABLE. And the BBs have a tendency to shift to the left, right, top, bottom (basically, they fly anywhere but straight)-Low muzzle velocity. If this gun had a more decent muzzle velocity, it would make up for the lack of hop up. Instead, it shoots very short range.-Laser is terrible. The laser doesn't work. Don't use it.But there are some good things.-THIS GUN LOOKS AWESOME. The silencer and sight really make this gun look great. Doesn't affect performance though. Shame.-The flashlight is the best. The light is LED and is awesome for night fights.So, with these things in mind, go ahead and buy yourself a good spring pistol with hop-up and 230 fps. You can thank me later."
1,Brown Kraft Envelopes,Most of open end are open. This order sold by 100 and the qualityis very bad. I was very disappointed by this order this time.Too bad!
5,Good quality,"The sticky strip on this envelope actually gets sticky, unlike others I've dealt with. Otherwise, they are simply brown envelopes!"
3,Doesn't seal well,"These manila envelopes are big enough to fit letter size paper. They're thick and don't feel flimsy, but the glue doesn't hold evenly along the flap. They do seal well enough to mail, but it looks cheap the way parts of the flap will hang loose. If you need the clasp more than the seal, these envelopes will do just fine. There's nothing wrong with the clasps."
2,Professional in Appearance Not Function,"Though the envelopes appeared professional upon arrival, when I went to use them, I was dismayed to find that that the glue did not secure them properly and the clasps were so misaligned from the holes it was difficult to fasten them. Disappointing."
5,"Great, solid feel, very natural sound","I have owned the AT MBK4 for several years and I find it is an excellent mic for certain situations. I often record from a super small ""handheld"" recorder that doesn't have phantom power and having battery power is a real Godsend. When you need a sensative mic that doesn't hype the sound but don't have phantom power available this is the bomb. I have never regretted my MBK4 purchase. I have used it as a recording mic with great results. It is an excellent lecturn mic and even works good on vocals. Good for piano, guitar and other acoustic instruments too."
3,MB-4K,"The MB-4K is a good microphone but I don't like it having a battery.The overall rating is good and the description of it is good. We are using it in a church with a good sound system and I was impressed with it and will buy another one similar to it but, it won't have a battery."
5,amazing sound card,"This is a much better sound card over the ""SB Live! 24-bit"". With EAX 4.0 and CMSS 2 along with the standard graphic equalizer and bass boost options your pc audio will sound loud, powerful and accurate. I hook my pc up to my stereo with a belkin cable splitter so this card plus my hi-fi stereo system equals some really good sounding mp3, cd and video games."
1,Beware,I have a deall 8400 and this card sounded great when I first installed it. Then for no particular reason it stopped working. Nothing. None of the troubleshooting pages at creative were of the least bit of help. I tried uninstalling and reinstalling everything. No results. Don't buy.
4,Great starter cage.,"This is a very versatile cage. Can be used for a ferrets, large rats, chinchillas, etc. Smaller animals could squeeze through the 1 inch bar spacings.Fairly easy to clean and keep clean. You can spot clean with Chlorox wipes. Or take the shelves out and wash them during a full cleaning. The shelves can be tricky getting placed on just the bar you want them to, because of the snug fit. But once they're on, no critter can move them!Plenty of space to add hammocks, toys, and a litter box. Highly recommend for anyone with rats!"
5,Good!,Excellent price for a large cage. I have a chinchilla and he likes the cage very much. Good for a ferret or chinchilla.!
4,Not For Ferrets,"I bought this cage for my ferret kit and at the time, she fit rather comfortably. However, she grew out of this cage within a few months. It's much more suited for rats and smaller animals.It's fairly easy to take apart but if you don't want to dismantle the entire cage for each cleaning process, you're outta luck. Cleaning was very difficult because the doors are rather small so you have to contort in order to reach corners.However, it's very well made. The plastic never cracked or wore through. The shelves were decent enough that they didn't dip after the first year."
4,Great Cage,"This cage is a great cage for the price, and easy to put together. My only complaint is the ladder, the bottom ladder is too steep for my 11 week old ferret. What I do is put clean old t-shirts underneath the bottom ladder so it's not so steep. Overall a great cage!!!"
2,"Beautiful Cage for a Great Price, But Definitely Not For Rodents","I absolutely love this cage. It's big, roomy, and came at an excellent price. Unfortunately, it has some construction flaws, and both of my rats are currently roaming around my house now because of this cage. I have 2 medium sized females and both escaped after the first night. I just caught one of them running around and tossed her back in, only to watch her hurl herself straight through the bars and back to her hiding place. I understand this cage is advertised for small pets like rabbits and ferrets, but I trusted that since so many reviews were about rats, I would have no problem. I'm now torn between returning the cage and trying to modify it to keep my girls contained and safe in the cage."
4,Good Starter Cage for a Ferret,"We changed our previous cage to this cage. The quality of the cage is slightly below good. Think something you would purchase at WalMart. It's not great, but it does the job. The plastic clips that hold the base to the cage broke during shipping. They are not really necessary because the weight of the cage is enough to keep it all together, but it would have been nice if they were not broken.The metal cage and plastics are ok. The metal is easily bent, think coat hanger thick and the plastics feel like they could be broken very easily.All in all, you get what you pay for and the price of this cage makes it a good value. I guess I was spoiled with the build quality of our prior cage which cost much more money.I like that you could replace the bowls with tubes for the ferret to run through and the size is acceptable. I would not use this for two ferrets, it's too small for that."
3,Great for ferrets but,"after reading the reviews that this cage was great for Rats and seeing pictures of it in various places and on various sites I got it for my female ratties. Bad idea as the bars are just far enough apart for their heads to fit through and where the head goes the bodies follow, I modded the cage with some panels off a smaller one where the quite sturdy shelves are at. maybe when my girls full grown (only 8-9 months) there will be less risk for her to escape. For now however nice as this cage was I would recommend something with smaller spacing for a rattie but I can imagine for a ferret this would be a heavensend."
4,"Great book, but with one major shortcoming","I got this book only a few days ago, and have hardly been able to put it down. The book simply reads like a great story about rum, and it actually pulls you along. The profiles of individual rums are very interesting and useful, and the photography throughout is spectacular.The major shortcoming is the photograph descriptions. The book is so well-written that it makes you feel like you're there, but the photograph descriptions as so general that they're useless, and actually take away from the book. One photograph shows someone walking up a colourful but run-down backroad in some Carribbean town, but all the caption says is the ""The Real Carribbean is in the backroads."" Others say things like ""Sugar cane harvest"" or ""A local enjoying some rum"". Some basic information about where the photo was taken and a bit more about what we're looking at would be nice."
4,"Finally, a coffee table book for people with too many Buffet albums.","RUM is about rum, how it's made, how it differs from one country or island to the next.RUM features great photography and some well presented bits of of history.It's not the definitive work, far from it, but it's nice to have. Like a mojito on a hot day."
2,"Superficial research, leftist political bent, ice, shake and you have this book","By far the most superficial and poorly researched book on rum available on Amazon. The rum books by Plotkins and Curtis are FAR better. Seems the author spent his research money on Che Guevara t-shirts and prostitutes during his trip to Cuba. Mind you, this opinion comes from a native of the Caribbean basin who has lived/visited nearly every rum producing country in the Western Hemispher over the past 15 years.I thought I bought a book about rum. Not some Brit's blind romance with the falied Cuban revolution and the Nicaraguan Sandinistas, while blaming Britain and the U.S. for all of the problems in the Caribbean. Next time spend more than a week in my region of the world, without Cuban/Nicaraguan government minders, to get a real feel for the region and our rich rum making tradition."
2,not bad but not good either,"I didnt recieve the book that is to go along with the dvd, but I was still able to figure out most of the information. I own the beginner rock guitar course with John McCarthy and the two lessons that follow. This lesson doesnt even compair to the Beginner rock guitar dvd. Even though it is not heavy metal guitar, he still teaches you everything you could learn from this dvd, plus much more. You could learn something from this but I would advise to go with the other one I mentioned. Good luck"
1,Zalman King must be stopped,"Caught this late at night (where it belonged). A complete and total tease. Music video editing, incomprehensible plots--ponderous and stultifyingly pretentious.I have a theory that [stuff] like this and the ""Red Shoe Diaries"" actually drives people TO hardcore pornography.ALRIGHT ALREADY--JUST GET TO IT!!!"
3,sturdy but could use a volume control,Works fine but for the price it ought to have a volume control. You need to have your hand on the pc volume control or risk getting your ears shattered!
3,good but not too comfortable,"for its price i can't really complain. it works good. the microphone receives well and the headset works. its also plug and play which is another thing going for it. But as a gamer (i wear this for long durations) these headsets are not comfortable to wear. you'll find your ears hurting if you keep these on for about an hour. so spend that little extra for a more comfortable headset if u plan on wearing it for long durationsp.s. this will probably outlast the more expensive stuff. i must have dropped this, stepped on, and rolled over a few dozen times and it still works."
2,Not good,The product is not as expected. The plastic is too weak and the sound quality is also not good. The only satisfaction that I had is that microphone is working atleast. I would suggest to spend some extra bucks to get a good one.
4,Good product.,"I purchased these headphones as a replacement for a cheap pair that stopped working. I wanted something cheap because they always seem to malfunction quickly. This has a good price, and it works well."
4,great for the price,"good for the price, microphone worked better then some of the high priced sets I've bought."
5,The Best SCI-FI that was ever on TV!,"Roughnecks- The Starship Troopers Chronicles is the best Sci-Fi that has ever graced television. A much better adaptation of the Robert A. Heinlein novel than it's live action film predecessor in every way. (Although, purists have and will always complain.) Engaging storylines, wonderful characterization and computer animation- this is a series that will hold it's own for a long time to come. From Pluto to Hydora to a desolate asteroid and back to Earth and few stops on worlds in-between, the series a varied and fast paced. Written more for adults than children, you can expect a higher degree of violence and character introspection than what is normal for an animated series or an any episode of Star Trek. All in all, if you are even just a minor fan the live action movie or just a fan of great television- this series is very much worth your time and money! (It is worth noting that the series was never completed, perhaps it's release on DVD will remedy this.)"
1,roughnecks- starship troopers- the pluto campaign,"THIS IS THE WORST CGI IV'E EVER SEEN. At first I thought cool because the movie was great, finally come continuity some closure.Perhaps they would use the same computer animation that was used in the movie.(well I was wrong) The graphics remind me of those old Mtv commercials, pretty much just bad overall.The story was none-existant and realism no such thing. I mean an animated version of one of the bloodiest movies in history and not one person came close to being killed.During the course of the whole movie you hear about these massive casualties but you see nothing. One word of advice don't by this movie, Ive seen better clamation than this CGI adventure. Granted out of 50 reviews, including mine, 48 spoke highly of this flick. I bet those 48 people either work for or know someone who works for the company and animators who made this garbage. Save yourself some money."
4,O.K.!!!,"not the greatest of roughnecks, but surly the funniest.there's really not much to say,other than i recommend the tescacampain.this one is more one that tells you who every one is.if you like this one buy the tesca campain.but if youve never herd of the roughnecks,BUY IT!!!i recomend TITAN A.E."
5,THE BUGS ARE BACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Pluto. Coldest planet in our solar system. No life.-We thought.I loved this watching TV show on FOX while eating breakfast. Unfortunately, they cancelled it (another one of my favourites gone!!). Now that there are videos about this show I can once again enjoy it. Just to let parents know, this movie has nowhere near as gory as the movie it is based on. The only gore I've seen is bugs getting shot and spraying their green blood on troopers & other things. This incredible movie lets kids enjoy the bug-human war toned down. Watch out for the other ""Roughnecks"" videos comin' out!!"
3,ROUGHNECKS HO!,"I have to agree that the sound & video on this DVD are pretty nice, but I dont like the 'motion-blur' effect that they used. I dont think Ive ever noticed this effect while watching it on TV. I find it to be very distracting, and looks more like a digital transfer flaw than a 'video effect'.I also wonder when video companies will ever realize that most fans would like to see all of the 'episodes' rather than a 'feature film' version comprised of edited together episodes.The same thing happened when Beast Wars was released on VHS, but thankfully, the Beast Wars: Classic Episodes DVD w/ bonus unrealeased episodes came out the same day as this Roughnecks DVD. Oddly though, I cant find it listed on amazon.com anywhere."
1,Pitiful!!,"If you're like me, and you're looking for a movie that finally does justice to Robert Heinlein's classic work, keep looking.Based on the other glowing reviews about this cartoon (I don't rate it at the level of animation), I purchased this in the hopes that it would more closely follow the simple, classic style of the novel. Instead it more closely follows the hype of the original movie but with a lower quality script and plotline.For those who are looking for a classic action adventure, set in a future where the the military participates in campaigns that contain more than stick figures shooting at cartoon monsters, I recommend that you pick-up the novel and give this DVD a big PASS!"
3,Am I the only one who...,"felt like this cgi cartoon was a little simple minded?I loved the Heinlein book. I also liked intensely the Verhoeven movie. However, with this, it felt like each of the characters was made out of wood, not electrons and that the stories were simply there to paint battle scenarios. When you play video games, there is usually cgi movies as intro, scene transition and postscript. This cartoon felt like that.Having said that, the effect were excellent. Amazing how not a single marine actually gets killed, although lotsa bugs go BLATT!"
5,Awesome,"I bought this DVD on a whim, and I must say it's one of the best purchases I've made in quite a while. Great computer animation, highly-entertaining storyline and character development. I can't wait for the second DVD (due in September)."
1,"Fun to make, but too dry","When I saw this product at one of my favorite kitchen stores, I just had to try it out, especially since I love this coffee cake and the Barefoot Contessa show. I figured it would be a great mix. I was very disappointed after baking the product that the cake itself was very dry and the crust was very hard. The flavor was there, but might need to add pudding to the mix or something else to add moisture to it. For the price of $14.95 that I had paid, it's probably worth it to just buy one already made from a local bakery. Definitely not worth the price paid. Sorry, Ina!"
2,"We tried, but it's dry","This is my sister's favorite type of cake. As teenagers we would make the Betty Crocker cinnamon swirl cake, which looked just like this one, and she was hoping for something similar. After she tried to make this mix a couple times without success, she asked me to try. I will say the overall flavor of this cake is really good, BUT it's very dense. The crust is thick and hard for a cake and the crumb is very dry. I tried using Plugra high fat butter, then substituting some of the butter with oil, and I even tried switching pans. I just could not get a moist cake from this mix."
5,Wonderful and unique,"I ordered this box and when I recieved it,it blew my mind.The box has a border opening (like a lid) and inside the box are five cases,two on the top,two on the bottom one behind the four.And a bonus booklet.The first disc contains gospel songs and a tour track ""Day in the grand canyon"" which was from an album that was an insturmental but had that track included but was never released as an LP or CD.And the last disc,includes takes for ""Girl in Saskatoon"" and vochal tests which are also included on other discs on this set.If want a track from his vochal sessions (which of course is not Cash) I recommend ""Heartbeat,"" or ""Hello Again"" or ""Rocket 69"" or any other vochal test.If you're looking for released,unreleased,alternate takes,orginials,or even the entire Columbia songs from Cash's career,this is the box set."
2,WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY,"ADVANCED TECHNIQUES ? It looks more like the Basic ones. Nothing that much to say, only that this books is not going to help you to have the basics of JKD (or better AMERICAN BOXING) that's what JKD is nothing more than the act of giving PUNCHES in a Punching Bag."
5,Great for our three rats,"This is a great large cage for our rats. It was easy to put together and sturdy. They also love the hammock. This cage would be good for all small pets like rats, ferrets, rabbits, etc. I can leave them in there while I am at school and not feel like they are too cramped. They can walk around and climb; overall it's just a great cage and at a really good price. It is much better than the selections they had at the pet store."
2,poop mess,"I purchase this for my dwarf rabbit. It is well made and looks fun for the rabbit, but because of the plastic, the poop does not fall to the bottom of the cage. Means you have to clean the cage daily and it can get bothersome:( I would try to find a cage that had the same idea but made with wire squares."
4,Great for Chinchillas!,"This cage is very very good for Chinchillas. It has a nice large bedding area, where it is hard for them to kick out the bedding when they frolic, and the different levels are really nice too! They can get lots of exercise in this cage, and it can be used for rabbits, too."
3,Nice to catch up with an old favorite,"I remember ""Where Have All The People Gone?"" (WHATPG) from way back when and enjoyed seeing it again.Was there ever a time when Peter Graves didn't have gray hair? He is convincing and sympathetic in the lead role. Apart from that, it was good to see stalwart performances from a solid supporting cast. Particularly striking are the very young Kathleen Quinlan and actor Noble Willingham, whom I had otherwise only seen in ""The Royale"", a rather good episode of ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"".The story is pretty routine, but absorbing enough for all that. The music is adequate.""The Embryo"", on the other hand, was new to me and most of it still is. I turned it off after only 20 minutes or so. Rock Hudson looks embarrassed and the story is just plain silly.So, three stars for this disc then - all of them for WHATPG."
2,Tums are better!,"During my pregnancies, I suffered awful heartburn like many women. My doctor recommended taking Tums. I tried both Tums and Rolaids, and I have to say the Tums worked and TASTED much better, but the Rolaids are ok."
2,"Fragile, very fragile.","I'm not going to go into my childhood, or how I love the Transformers or any of that stuff, I just wanted to give a quick review. As always, you get what you pay for. I bought this today and within five minutes of transforming it one of the joints popped out and I can't for the life of me get it to sit correctly back in the socket.Bottom line is that it is very cool that ten dollars will get you a G1 inspired Astrorain or Starscream, but be aware these feel very flimsy and are definately better utilized sitting on your desk at work in robot mode than being transformed back and forth while you are bored watching TV.Very cool, very flimsy, very inexpensive."
3,Bad classic remake.,This toy has three modes. The best I think is the space shuttle mode. The train mode is hideous and looks like it wasn't very well thought out. The robot is alright. In the robot mode the forearms have to stay bent of the two shuttle halves easily cover them back up. The legs are kinda of wobbly. I was expecting something more.
2,System Compatible?,"Great game! Well sort of. It is a lot of fun to play and pretty realistic with good graphics and good sound. Unfortunately, my system exceeds the requirements by yards and yet it is still not working properly. The game terminates itself within the first quarter with no explanation. EA's Tech support cannot find the problem and several people have taken a look at it to try to help. Simply stated, could be a great game if it only worked like it is supposed to. We need some competition for this game!!"
5,Best Football game ever....for any system...hands down,"This is the game for people that know and want real football. Not like that Sega crap where you have powerups for running the ball and tacklers changing momentum and diving 5 yards to make a tackle. Dont be fooled by those Sega NFL fans. It is purely an arcade game with lots of flash...period.Madden is greatly improved over the 2k2 PC version. Tightest, most realistic gameplay you can find, by a large margin. John and Al sound great and on cue.Only a solid video card and alot of RAM are needed to make this game sing. I only have a P2-464 CPU and it is smooth and looks great."
5,Online Gaming lives!,"I first purchased the game soon after it was released and have ventured into my second year of a franchise as the Coach of the St. Louis Rams. Upon getting a DSL modem I saw the true potential of Madden 2003. Online gaming. For starters, you can play the mini camp games or 2 minute drills and see how your scores compare with everyone elses. Next, in what is a feat itself is the fact that you can either set up or join a NFL game and play another gamer for 4 five minute quarters of nail biting fun and it's nothing short of a football version of chess where you are trying to make your move. You are rewarded with ""tokens"" win or lose which are transferred to your online ""sim"" which starts off basic but then can be dressed as the ultimate fan. If you own a cable or DSL modem, you won't be disappointed.This is the icing on the cake!"
1,Madden nfl 2003 PC version,"A horrible version of Madden 2003 converted to the PC platform. I bought the game two weeks ago, and I get an error message ~75% of the time I try to start it. ""application has performed an illegal operation...."" you know the one.DON'T BUY THE PC VERSION! PRESERVE YOUR SANITY! EA really needs to put out more quality products."
1,Seems Like a Beta Version,"Frequent lock-ups and total system crashes. This is the only (retail) software that I've experienced these problems with since the days of DOS. When it is running there are quite a few details that give the impression it is a beta version that was never completely finished before hitting the shelves.EA tech support operates under the ""no not us, somebody else"" method of problem solution."
2,"Great graphics, not much fun","The game is full of wonderful graphics. In fact it is very well done. However, the game play needs some definite work. Playing defense is impossible...expect to be scored on every time. The computer never punts, even if you play the worst teams in the league. I am fine with difficult offensive play, but if you punt one time, you lose.The fact that you can only play exhibition against the computer is also a negative. Play NFL 2K3...it's much more entertaining."
3,WOO,this game is amazing.the graphics are awsome although the crowd does look kinda fake.the field degration isnt there either.and what about the niforms.playing a game in poring down rain and your uniform doesnt get dirty???c'mon fellas add some player realism to it.the gameplay is good although sometimes the computer can bust a ridiculously long pass even when triple covered.it gets annoying after a while.sometimes with under two minutes to go the computer magically puts together an unstoppable drive and score.its kinda gay.the referees can get in your way too and can really make you mad.overall ima hafta give this game a three star rating.maybe the next madden will contain some more realism in the graphics and the crowd.
3,the crowd's cheering is a big white wall........,"I havn't been a PC gamer long. I purchased Madden 2003 for Christmas and am trying to get used to the game. Pretty tough. But like all things, I'll eventually catch on. Graphics are great. Sound is pretty good. But its not fun playing in a giant white tent every single game. Thats my problem. I don't know if I forgot to press an option in the pre-game setup or what. But no matter what game or no matter who's playing who. Every single game is in a big white domish looking stadium. With 'zero ' seats. I repeat, 'zero' seats. Did I do something wrong? And why is there only four players on each team, on the sidelines. Where is EVERYONE????? Other than playing with no crowd and having no one to just look at on the sidelines. This game is pretty cool. Can someone please help me? write a review or something, please???thanks......"
1,Doesn't install,"I'd love to play this game, but it doesn't install on my PC. I worked with EA support to try and resolve it but they couldn't come up with a solution. It's not like I have an antiquated PC -- it's a 2.5-year-old Dell Pentium III 600mhz with 256MB RAM and a 32MB NVIDIA video card. EA support indicated that their CD has some sophisticated copy-protection features, but these features are apparently preventing either of my CD drives (I have two) from reading it properly. Beware!"
1,Boring,"I love decorating books, and loved the old House and Garden magazine, so expected to love this. Unfortunately, all the rooms look alike, just the colors change, so its boring, boring, boring."
5,Great Westchester commentary,"Witty, wise, and warm. A delightful collection. Ms. Boesky has a down-to-earth quality. The column ""Scandal and Recovery"" is very inspirational as she describes how she coped, with spunk, with the insider trading scandal involving her then-husband, Ivan. The columns are miniature gems."
5,Storytelling at its best,Each story is written with humor and wisdom. She makes the reader feel like an insider as she relates personal anecdotes and srories. I couldn't put it down!!!
4,Stay Awake long enough for the...,"Insomniacs are great. I am just sorry that it took me three years to find this CD, for that I will pay a penance. Who doesn't like a little pop in their garage?See also The Waking Hours, The Greenhornes, Mooney Suzuki."
3,Old fashioned,"Maybe this used to be a good book, but it didn't age well. I would use Barron's ""How to Prepare for the Computer-Based Toefl Essay: Test of English As a Foreign Language"" instead of this book."
5,Another Great Read,"In this particular book, the kids find a wishing stone and for every wish they make there is an unforseen price tag attached. The entire series is great and the characters are delightful."
4,Adventurous,"After finding a wishing stone, Adam and a group of three friends accidently start to wish for things. But then they find out that there is a price for every wish. The ""collector"" soon comes and transports them to a slave planet to work off their depts. Adam and Watch (his friend) manage to escape and find a friend who helps them rescue the two girls. In the end there is a twist and everyone is happy. By Robert Nguyen."
4,Her long-sought haven had become a house of peril!,"The man who Annie thought was her father told her on his death bed who her real family was. When Annie shows up on their door step it is only her real father who truly welcomes her. Everyone else is suspicious of her and thinks she is a fraud. Her father's step-son Christian makes it very clear that he doesn't trust her, but then why does he give her looks that make her melt? Annie is determined to find out more about how and why her mother and Annie disappeared 17 years ago. But during her investigation she runs into danger that threatens her life.I really liked this book. My only complaint is that it takes Christian to long to trust her. At first them bantering back and forth was fun, but after a while it just got old. Other than that this was a nice read. Clara Wimberly hardly fails to disappoint."
3,Could be better,"The best thing about this shoe is that it is lightwieght. The size felt kinda 1/2 size a bit too small, but it could just be a tight fit. The soles of my feet really burn up after a 3 mile race and my friend who had the same shoe had a crazy blister after his first time using them in a race(He never used them after that. I on teh other hand have kept on using them because Ive never experienced the blister like he has). The rubber heads feel bulky especially if the course varies between rocky and pavement. Even though there are a lot of things iffy with the shoe's design, Ive PR'd every time ive worn them as opposed to racing with my regular trainer shoes."
4,Great for guns,"This safe/lock box is great for storing firearms or ammo. The loud speaker is annoying when you push the buttons, but this can easily be removed in 5 minutes. Has nice heavy solid construction."
2,"I just do not know, cuz I am not going to buy...see why","Why?The dimensions are not listed. How will anybody know if their laptop will fit with all the different sizes and thicknesses?I bought a laptop safe from another vendor and it stated dimensions. My lap top should have 1/2 inch clearance through the door. Guess what? It did not fit. Know the dimensions: Door opening width, height, depth, and allow 1+ inch extra for the fat back on the rear of the door.It is like trying to sell me a car and not telling me what size engine is in it. Incomplete data= No sale!I will retract or amend this review upon notification of correction."
3,One big flaw,"I bought this to transport my camera gear. It is just high enough to accept my Nikon SLR. It is well made, works well but has one BIG flaw. There is a light in the back of the mechanism. It cannot be seen. The light is not bright enough to be seen in daylight. There is a switch on the side of the mechanism. The switch is not marked and can easily be moved by accident. If the light is left on, the batteries go dead in about two days, and you need the key to get in. I have taped the switch off with Gorilla tape.The unit I received had the switch half-way on. With the switch disabled this unit is 5 star; with the switch operational it is 1 star."
1,Perfect Security,This product was way to big to fit in a drawer. Nice design and plenty of room but it will not fit in most average size drawers. The Stack-On PDS-500 Drawer Safe with Electronic Lock is a much smaller safe that will actually fit comfortably inside a dresser drawer and comfortably fit any large pistol with room to spare.Stack-On PDS-500 Drawer Safe with Electronic Lock
4,great looking purse...main zipper broke after 2 weeks.,"my lady loves the purse and the construction is pretty solid, the main zipper on the purse broke after about a week. Other than that she loves all the pockets and the material and the Dead Head. awesome :-)"
4,zupreemmm,"This diet is better than many others, don't get me wrong, but I believe it is best supplemented with other foods such as 8-1 ultimate crunchy in like a 3:1 ratio (1 being the zupreem), because this diet makes my ferret's poop really sticky and soft and harder to clean up."
3,A Good Fun Story.,"I enjoyed reading ""Downsiders"", by Neal Shusterman, as I did the last book I read from this author, ""Unwind"". Problem is this story, although good, isn't as sophisticated and didn't connect with me as solidly. Other reviewers explain the story as being about people living underground, directly below where the rest of us reside. And although the concept isn't novel, as others have used similar themes, Mr. Shusterman's weaving of the characters and unique handling of the contrasts between those above and below, and the exceptional relationship between the male and female protagonists make for a fun reading experience - it truly is a witty fantasy. It's a short read, though, only 246 pages and I'd have preferred another chapter or two if only to expore further the three extraordinary secondary characters involvement in the story. Three and a half stars."
3,"An odd, but enjoyable book.","This book really makes you think. I found it to be very odd, but at the same time I enjoyed it. It made me think, what if there really are other worlds in the midst of us? I liked the creativity that the author had with creating the downside. It is a very original place. It has its own rules, clothing, way of thinking, and pretty much everything else. This book wasn't one of my favorites, but I would recommend it."
4,Mole People,"The premise of the book is fantastic. Lindsay, a girl who has recently moved to live with her father in New York, stumbles across Talon, a boy who lives underneath New York City. In a friendship that grows Lindsay learns about the world of the mole people or downsiders from Talon. Talon comes to learn of the topside world because of the relationship as well. But what may seem to be an innocent friendship at first could be the pin of a grenade that is pulled resulting in a war of downsiders against topsiders.The book does have a rich premise, with wonderful details, and charming characters... but it suffers from having an implausible group of cows running through the underground of New York and a weak ending. Downsiders, is a good book that Shusterman and his editor should have spent more time on in order to make it a great one.Crazy James"
1,Not a HARDCOVER!!!,"Please beware. This product is advertised as a hardcover but it is actually a turtle back. If you don't know what that is, it is a horrible, junky paperback edition with some boards slapped on. The binding is awful and breaks even sooner than a paperback. My 1 rating is for the abysmal quality of this edition, not the writing. I have now spent 2 months trying to get my money back. Do not buy this book, and tell amazon that they must advertise fairly - no turtle backs labeled as hardcovers!"
2,Interesting,I did like this book. It was a nice idea for a book and stuff. But it did get really boring after awhile. The only reason I kept reading it was because we had to for Language Arts.
3,not good tacky glue on catalog sealing surface,"after sealing the catalog, I have to add additional tape to the sealed catalog to keep the catalog sealed.the product manufactures quality process people knew that , however, the drive to make more profit was the deciding factor.Customers do not matter when they could interfere with the bottom line making a profit."
3,Ehhh...might wait for something better,"This flag is really light weight and the image is only printed on one side, as opposed to it being a two sided flag. The sharpest looking flag I could find, but for the price I thought it should have been of better quality."
3,Cool display piece with problems.,"This is a great looking big 18 inch electronic figure that includes tons of great sounds and quotes from the original ROcky movie. I have had about 6 of these and every one has the mouth quickly stop moving along with the left hand i believe it is after only some light usage. I have 3 available for cheap but be warned of the issues in advance, other than that it is a great rare item to look at."
3,Very hard to understand the letters for little ones,When I received these I was disappointed after reading the reviews the letters are very hard to read my daughter is 15 months and as she is a very smart little lady these letters will be hard to work with her with because they a difficult to make out what it is not for teaching purposes but are fun to play
5,Perfect,"The magnets won't detach, the letters are bright and fun, they are easily picked up by little fingers... This is exactly what I was looking for. My 1 year old loves them. I recommend these over any plastic or wooden magnetic letters/numbers."
2,Roof snapped in 3 days,This screenhouse was only up for three days when thre plastic on one of the roof supports snapped and collapsed that side - which then ploaced pressure on the supports on that side and broke two of them. I was very disappointed with the frame of this product. The roof and sides are great - the frame leaves something to be desired.
5,"High quality, great value.",The screened canopy is everything I needed and hoped I'd get. Over the last few years I've come to trust Amazon fulfilled orders to avoid those unpleasant surprises when a box gets opened.
5,Best Screen House We Have Owned,We have owned several screen houses and have worn them all out with our camping regime. We are volunteer camp ground hosts and the screen house stays up all season. The Swiss Gear screen house is the best we have ever owned and I do not foresee us ever wearing it out. Easy to set up and take down. Flexible to use screen fabric or not. Sturdy even in bad storms. Spend the money and get the best.
2,Not Built For The Long Run,"Functionally, this is a great product. Also, when it's up, it looks darn good. So why only 2 stars? Well, after 2 years, the canopy has turned as fragile as rice paper. We just set it up for the 3rd season and while pulling the corners down onto the frame ... one corner tore. Sort of like, you know .... toilet paper. Ok ... no problem, right? Just order another canvas top. Right? Nope !!! Not sold separately! Additionally, last year the zipper went on the screening. So, for 1 year anyway ... this was a great product. Now ... does it really make any sense to sell a product ( at this price )with separate parts that cannot be replaced? Especially if they break down in a years time? Not to me it doesn't .... No more Swiss Gear for us !!!"
3,Well built Screenhouse,"The construction of this screenhouse is excellent, unfortunately the lovely silvery shine attracts bugs, hence the need for mesh netting (which I did not use). The center of the tent is high, making it feel quiet spacious and less confining. We are very pleased with our purchase."
3,"Leaky in the rain, but otherwise very good.","I've owned this item for two seasons. Easy to set up. Well constructed. Keeps the bugs out. Spacious. All good. Except mine became leaky in the rain during the first season. Small holes began to develop in the fabric. Surprising to me, cause everything else about this item was excellent. Unfortunately, I failed to anticipate a strong thunderstorm one night last summer. The wind bent the frame beyond repair. I'm not sure if I will buy a replacement or try to find something that will not leak. Downgraded due to leaks."
5,"$400 Tent for $140!!! Seriously, it really is THAT good!","""Wow! No, seriously... Wow!""This is what you'll be saying too as you unpack this incredibly high-quality popup shade tent.Everything, and I do mean 'everything' about this tent is top-notch.The design, materials, craftsmanship, convenience, durability, ease of use...I could go on for days about this thing.But let me save you some time... GET IT! You will NOT be disappointed!"
2,Not as good as my old Northwest territory,"Bought this to replace my Northwest territory Screenroom that was destroyed in a severe thunderstorm.The roof canopy leaked from the first outing and I have pictures of THIN or NONexistant coating on the roof that I'd be glad to share.By the way, this was $184.00 plus, my Northwest territory cost me $89.00 and lasted 6 years!!I would not buy this item again, I'd go to Wallyworld or Kmart and buy whatever they had. It will last as long or longer and be much cheaper!"
4,good buy,"I am happy with my decision to get this shelter. I choose this one because of the reviews, the price, and I liked that it came with the screen sides and deck feet while some other brands make you purchase those seperately. I have set it up alone three times, and while it is much easier with a helper it can be done alone. It seems quite sturdy although I haven't used it in any heavy winds yet.One thing that really dissapointed me- I found it IMPOSSIBLE to fit the cover and the screen sides back into the storage pouch they came in. I tried to do it myself with no success, then recruited the help of my sister who is very persistent and hates to give up and we decided it just cannot be done. I know they were in there when I unpacked the shelter but I don't how it was possible. Now the screen sides are stored in a seperate bag since they are not used every time we use the shelter. Just one thing that annoyed me but I really do like the product."
3,Solid but challenging to get up,"This was super difficult to attach and figure out, even with three people working at once! Once we got it up it was good for the weekend, but I don't think I'd recommend it for short-term uses."
4,Walmart has cheaper options -- but this is a _quality_ shade,"Very pleased with this shade. Pop-up design is similar to many others available at Walmart, but we were particularly interested in getting something rugged enough. Have been very pleased -- although we have not yet had occasion to use the mosquito netting. The canvas top appears to have a metallic-like coating on the inside and the overall sun protection is very good: not like being indoors, but good enough to spend several hours in the sun without scorching.Securing it to the ground in winds: All of the weight is at the top of the structure and the canopy is big, so it can move off in a hurry in a breeze... but it is easy to secure and pretty solid."
4,Quality product,"Easy to set-up, priced well, durable quality. Satisfied with $ spent. Tough to return to storage bag once opened and used."
3,Swiss Gear Smart X0X10 Screenhouse,"Unfortunately I did have a mishap with the Swiss Gear Smart screenhouse during that last rain storm we had. I remember when my children were little and we go camping the screenhouses was so strong during rain storms. Bear in mind, my children are now 29 and 27.A couple of weeks ago I had to call/email Amazon because the screenhouse just broke during the rainstorm. I had not even had it for a week and that's how weak this screenhouse was. Of course Amazon replaced it, but what about if we use it again and this happens. This is our worry especially if we are far from home. I honestly would like to recommend it but not after what happen to me."
4,very durable,"This tent was very durable and helped me out tremendously. It stood up to strong wind and was easy to put up and tear down. I received it when they told me I would receive it. The only trouble I had was knowing what side the walls should be attached because it wasn't clear. Aside from that, it was a great buy!!!"
3,Screens too small,"Two person assembly, screen did not quite fit. Read review of separate purchase of canopy and screen could be problematic, so purchased screenhouse. Still tight fit and could not get screen to zip to close all 4 sides. Have not yet used in field, so unsure about water repelling feature."
4,This book is to help others understand the sensuality of SM,"This book describes a period in the life of a nobelman who totally submits to the woman he loves, no, adores. He worships her totally and promises her his total obedience. It did not start out that way....It is very useful for people who are interested or want to try to understand the sensuality and excitement of S&M. It answers the many times asked question: what excites you about being whipped? Ofcourse it is not the same for every person, but this book gives you a pretty good idea of what goes on in a submissive mind...A recommender!"
3,So-so,"Just a so-so live album. Too many acoustic and slowed-down versions. A bit tired sounding. Stick with ""Raw Melody Men,"" with original drummer/songwriter Robert Heaton (RIP)."
2,Wrap falls off the tree constantly,I bought this wrap because one of our kittens outside like to use the trees as his scratching post. All this did was give him something to play with after he tore it off and for me to clean up.I tried everything and every trick to keep it on short of glueing it to the tree.
5,Stevie's In Over Her Head!,"When Stevie points out how ""helpful"" Veronica is and gets the job of showing around a visiting Italian horse team, (a job that Veronica wanted) she doesn't expect this kind of revenge coming her way. Turns out, ""someone"" volunteered Stevie to run the Children's Hospital Festival, the school's Spring Fair, and debate for class president all on the same day. What's worse, Kate and Christene plan on visiting that weekend as well. Just when it turns out that Stevie won't have time for anything anymore, Mrs. Reg prompts them to see the problem in a different way. With the help of Carole, Lisa, Phil, Kate, Christene, and all four of the Italian boys, Stevie's able to pull everything off AND get back at Veronica! This book was one of the most delightful of the whole series. There's fun and laughs to be had on this whacky saddle club adventure. How did Stevie do it? That's for me to know, and for you to find out."
1,Not like my other MANT-310.,I was quite dissappointed in this antenna. I purchased the same antenna about 1.5 years ago and got this one for my second television because I have a digital television and prefer to not have cable. This antenna was labeled to be the same as my original but it is not. The cables were different and caused it to not work on my television. Overall it was just more cheaply made. I called Phillips directly and they told me to just return it. Amazon was great about accepting the refund. Not so happy with Phillips.
2,Passive antennas do better,"I recently purchased this model in hopes of getting better digital reception than the low-end (but generally solid)RCA ANT111 Basic Indoor Antenna. This amplified antenna is not the answer. The device is pretty poor without power, and even at variable levels of gain the difference between this an a passive model is marginal. Others have reported better results, but I have not seen it. This one is going back to the store."
2,No good for HD radio,Bought this for HD radio. It's worse than the simple dipole wire antenna that came with the radio. Can't offer an opinion on it for TV. Seems adeqautely built.
5,Time doesn't go by!!,"We have viewed the available seven tapes so many times, they are ALL getting dog-eared! Such a warm feeling when Jean looks at Lionel and visa versa. The whole cast is so much a part of our lives now, we don't ever want to see a final episode.It gives us a reason to turn on the telly for real true entertainment.. ....release more episodes,soon! ROCK ON, FOREVER!"
3,Woah...,"Okay, so you've been to parties where there's a dj and an mc throwing down together, yeah? This is the same idea, except instead of an mc it's a priest. Be forwarned, this is godcore. Maybe the name of the album should have given it away, but I figured it was just another cheesy title picked out my some record company exec somewhere. Wrong. Just too much preaching leads to my 3-star rating...perhaps if you're into that type of thing you'll really dig this album. I will definitely say that the beats contained on this disc are dope...it's hard to track down good hard house these days that's not saturated with cheesy rap $h*t, and this disc at least doesn't suffer in that aspect. Without the sunday school atmosphere, I'd have rated this cd a high-4 or a 5..."
4,Find out what true beauty is!,"We, as women, seem to be under a lot of pressure to be perfect. (or at least look perfect) But this book is an excellent reality check of what true beauty really is, and what it isn't. It isn't about whether I'm a size 2, but it IS about the condition of my heart and having a healthy perception of my self-worth."
4,Great book!,"Great book that pretty much runs the gamut of covering everything new thought, as well as providingpractical ways of improving your life."
5,Amazing turnaround,This book completely turned me around in my thinking. I was inmanagement and left to go into sales. I thought that I had tolearn all these sales techniques and the right words to be successful. I was frustrated because it was not happening and felt that I lacked something. I read this book and got an entirely new aspect. The next week I began my journey to success and have continued to get more successful every week.The key words were that I already had everything I needed to be successful. This is a must read for any profession.
5,Very helpful!,"These cards are easy to read; the definitions are short and to the point. I've actually been able to get through almost the whole box in about a month, just by going over a few cards every morning. I've seen the words on numerous practice tests I've done. Altogether a good purchase."
4,Really works on your vocab,"These cards are super useful for studying for the GRE. I knew I needed to expand my vocabulary, and these cards are really helping. Im working through 20 a day, but its quick to learn the words and quiz myself with the cards. The pronunciation guide, sample sentence, and synonyms are very helpful as well. Definately worth the purchase. Only thing I would change is the quality of the paper- maybe they needed them thin to fit 500 in a box, but they definately arent made of cardstock or any other sturdy paper. Turned me off at the beginning, but definately doesn't matter now because they are so useful."
2,Not flash cards,"The content is good, but these aren't actually flash cards. It's a bound book with very thin pages and two words to each page. Studying with flashcards is best done by testing one's self with cards, slipping failures back into the deck for near-term review, and setting repeated successes aside. This isn't possible with a book."
2,"an okay product, but not as efficient as it could be","I purchased last year's edition, where you bought an entire book (the same size as a regular GRE review book) which had nothing but pages full of pull-apart flashcards. I much prefered that format as you could actually tear the cards out and have small flashcards with all of the information on them. I do not like the flipbook method of studying vocabulary becuase then you begin to remember paterns, not definitions."
3,SAVE YOUR MONEY,"Save your money! I like this product as I own it myself, but I have just discovered that Kaplan offers this same product as an app for my iPod...for FREE! Originally, I liked the flashcards because they are portable, but having this on my iPod is even MORE portable and handy! No paper to flip through, no possibility to play 500+ card pickup...save 10 bucks, and get the free app!"
4,Different is not always bad,"When I saw this book in the store, I had the same thought as previous reviewers. I thought that I would rather have actual cards instead of words in a book. But it actually works pretty well for me. The book is designed such that you fold the corner of a page when you master the word. So, after I complete a certain number of words, I go back through them randomly, skipping some, but always going over the pages that are not folded.The good thing about the words being in a book is that I can actually take all of the words with me. There is no way I could carry 500 flash cards and study in the car, at the doctor's office, etc.Of course there is a chance that you will memorize patterns, but you can lessen that chance if you vary your study methods. Flashcards is never enough."
2,Not very efficient,"As other reviews have said, the ""flipbook"" method is just entirely inefficient when it comes to memorizing words. Even back in elementary school when I was using flashcards, I realized my brain often does not memorize the word itself as much as the order, and with this book it is no different. Also, the two words per page is kind of annoying, and I just don't see why they could not just give us normal, real flashcards. They are so much more efficient! Overall I really would not recommend this. It's too bad there really aren't any good GRE flashcards for sale; Thankfully it won't really matter after next summer when the GRE changes to be more about actual verbal intelligence and less about memorizing words that hardly anyone uses..."
4,No nonsense studying,"If your weakness is the verbal section, this is a great tool (because after all, the verbal section mostly just vocab anyway). I would guess that the average test taker already knows about 1/3 to 1/2 of the words in this book, but for under $10, you can't complain."
3,Good,"I think that this item is helpful for non-native English speakers who struggle with vocabulary. If you grew up in a house that didn't speak English as a first language, I would highly recommend it."
4,Better than wasting time with the prep books,"I've found all the GRE prep books, including the ones just related to vocab or the verbal section, to be actually detrimental to the learning/cramming/studying process. The vocab flashcards are much better because I don't have to cut through all the clunky (usually incorrect) prose and useless methods that take up most of the space, and my time, when using the books. If you're already good with language, skip the books (you'll just have to learn counter-intuitive processes and then un-learn them) and rock hard on the vocab cards.The one thing I don't like about this product is the size of the cards--they'd be a lot easier to handle if they were 3x5 index card size; they're actually the size of business cards. It would be nice if they were easy to shuffle, like playing cards, but maybe that's just a weird desire exclusive to me."
3,It's pretty good to study vocab,"Pros: Very easy to read, helps you learn lots of words easily.Cons: Not as many words as you think at first. Also, the vast majority of of the words you end up memorizing from this won't be on the GRE. You might be better off studying root words or latin words than memorizing these seldom-used words."
3,Review,The cards were kind of helpful. I feel like they didnt really prepare me too much for the test. There are so many large words that I never really learned any new ones. And there is no way to know what words will be on the test.
4,"haven't taken the exam yet, but...","My only compliant is that if you don't have a book that gives tips on the most popular words (I have the Kaplan GRE strategies and review 2010 book) used on the exam, it's waaaaaay too much vocab. Otherwise I've found them to be pretty helpful."
4,GRE Vocab Cards,"Bought these cards to study for the GRE general test. I haven't taken the test yet, so I can't comment on how many of these words showed up on the test. But as for the cards themselves, they seem to be pretty good. I knew 30-35% of the words before-hand, but that still left hundreds of words to learn. There is a good variety of words in the cards, but the definitions were definitely lacking. They seemed to all be 3-4 word definitions made up by the author, rather than dictionary definitions. Sometimes I agreed with them, sometimes they seemed really wacky. And the synonyms were pretty vague as well, sometimes barely relating.The card stock was somewhat light. These aren't thick index card stock, but they aren't super thin either. Good enough, but sometimes the cards get stuck together and you don't even notice.Overall they are good, with a good variety of words. Hopefully they help me out on the test"
4,Not Flash Cards?,I got these today and I am wondering why none of these reviews say that it is actually a flip book and not actual flashcards.?
3,"good selection of words, simple selection of synonyms","This book is reasonably useful, yet the synonym selection is not very impressive and the definitions are comically oversimplified from time to time. The bottom line is that this felt like an SAT study guide and not a GRE helper."
3,"Decent cards, but not that great...","The cards themselves were pretty good. I learned a lot of new words from the cards; however, I don't know if it was just bad luck, but I seen very few of these flash card words on the actual exam. I memorized the entire 500 words thoroughly, an only came across maybe a dozen or so. So, needless to say, I was pretty disappointed. Hopefully everyone else has a better experience, and my exam was just an anomaly."
2,Disappointing,"I bought a variety of GRE study materials, and the Kaplan cards were my least favorite. The words are good, but all that is provided is a simple definition. The Barron's flashcards have definitions, antonyms, a sample sentence completion and a sample analogy. The Kaplan cards were far more simple, which some people might prefer. I happen to prefer more thorough cards, so I was disappointed with these. The cards themselves are very small (roughly the size of the Chance and Community Chest cards in Monopoly) and are very, very thin. I guess some people might like how small they are, but I would have preferred something sturdier. Overall, there were too many deficiencies for these cards to be useful to me and I would not recommend them."
2,NOT flashCARDS,"The content is good; however these are NOT flashcards as the title states. It is actually a paperback book with two words on each page w/ their definitions on the reverse side. The pages are regular paper, not even the type you could tear out & make into CARDS. There IS another BOX of Kaplan GRE Exam review cards. Be careful when ordering."
3,Worthy product,"It's a great idea, the product truely does encompass vocabulary that you will see on the GRE. What I did not like about the cards were that due to how thin the paper that was used to print the words on, they would stick together. Often times, I would pull a stack of cards out and start studying only to find that the word I thought I was learning was actually the meaning to another word, since the card was stuck to one another. I did enjoy the size of the cards, I would keep them in my truck and on my lunch break, or at times when I was parked in my vehicle I could easily access them to study. There are so many words to learn, and this alongside some other learning materials will help you score higher on the GRE. No doubt about it. Good luck."
4,Great way to reinfoce all those annoying words!!!!,"Welcome to the part of the English language that you will never use!The flash cards helped in preparation for the GRE. I do not agree with the GRE being as vocabulary-intensive as it is -- I would prefer that it would focus on cogent communication skills as opposed to bombastic vocabulary that only GRE test writers use in everyday communication. Anyway, I digress.These helped in conjunction with other study skills. I also acquired the Kaplan test prep book and the ""Cracking the GRE"" test prep book.They also have a high resale value! I was able to post them at auction after the test and almost recovered the full value!"
4,little flash cards,Hey they say good things come in small packages... I hope they are right b/c these flash cards are very small.
2,GRE Flash cards,Plenty of flash cards. Too many! Cards themselves are thin and difficult to use. Didn't really help much.
2,Some words missing,There are a lot of words in the GRE sample test that were not covered like cajole or penchant.
3,"Not ""Flashcards""--Product Name Misleading.","I returned this product because it doesn't have flashcards, i.e. vocabulary words printed on hard or thick cards. None of the pages can be torn out of the book. You're supposed to flip through the pages of the book and fold over the corners of the pages that contain the word that you've already memorized; turn the book upside down to learn the rest of the vocab words.Despite this inconvenience, I'm pretty sure it has all the words that Kaplan can provide."
2,a lot of words,"There are a lot of words in this box but it did not help me at all with the GRE. There is no way you can learn these words, especially if you are not using them in your vocabulary. I suggest you start studying for the GRE about 1 year before you take it. However, there are naturally gifted people out there you will not have no problems at all with the GRE, I'm just not one of those people."
2,Poorly made all around,"These cards are poorly made. They are flimsy - not even made of card stock. They are small. I would probably have been happy with them if I had not also ordered the Barrons GRE study cards. These cards pale in comparison to Barrons - Barrons are heavier, they come with a ring so you can easily take some with you to focus your studies on, and they contain better word use practice on the back.Save your money - go with Barrons."
1,Not worth the money,I just took the GRE today and none of the vocabulary words from this book appeared on the exam.
1,kaplan should be ashamed,"Buyer beware! Although the box says ""2nd edition"" beneath the title (only on the version w/ yellow text), these are the exact same cards as the ""1st edition."" I can't help but think that this is Kaplan's shameful attempt to prey upon students, who are desperate to do well on the GRE, by repackaging the same product and marking up the price. It's a sham!"
4,"Great cards, but use other vocabulary-builder aids as well.","I bought these in the summer and they're great. I saw a bunch of those words on my GRE exam and it definitely made the test easier for me to take. I find that vocabulary is key to getting a good verbal score. Some of the questions on the GRE test your vocabulary knowledge by making you choose among 5 words each of which more or less mean the same thing. These cards will help you. Of course one should also use other vocab-builder aids as Kaplan sometimes uses meanings that are a little strange and not always easy to remember. Learning words from a variety of sources (reading, apps, Barron's word list etc.) will get you on track to a great vocabulary, the cards are a good place to start."
1,Full of mistakes,"This box is full of inconsistencies and mistakes!For example, many of the words are given as verbs, with a verb definition, but then the sentence uses the word as an adjective and all the synonyms are adjectives.There are typos: an instance of 'hetergeneous' that should be 'heterogeneous.'The card 'amortize' gives one synonym: conviviality...those aren't remotely similar...This box obviously is in need of a good proofreading! One star."
3,Not really flash cards,"I purchased these hoping to save time printing out hundreds of 3x5 index cards. I assumed they would be printed on card stock but are more like the paper used for magazine covers. Not really manageable for studying ""on the go"" as Kaplan suggests."
4,Useful for studying vocab,"My wife used these to bulk up her vocabulary in preparation for the GRE and she really found them useful. If you're the type of person who learns well with flashcards, these are a good choice."
4,Best Little Box,"This box was awesome! I saw a lot of these words on my GRE test. I recommend becoming best friends with your dictionary, because some of the definitions are a little wonky. Also the cards have synonyms which is really helpful, but again you want to double check the meaning of that they give on the card, because some of the definitions didn't match completely."
4,GRE Flash cards,"Content excellent, I thought the format would be ""flash CARDS"" as the title suggests, not a fat book that is difficult to carry and use during ""brief"" breaks, i.e. waiting in line, stopped at red light, vacuuming..."
4,Great vocabulary builder,"Great choice for studying GRE-specific words out of everyday usage range. Covers 500 hard words most commonly met in test. May be really useful aid while preparing for GRE test, specially for Analogies and Anthonyms sections of writing comprehension."
3,A little on the easy side,"Though the format of these cards were excellent, and though it was convenient to have ready-made pocket-sized cards for study on the go, I wasn't a huge fan of this product. For one thing, the words were too basic: it would probably be a good study set for someone whose weakness is verbal and needs to study hard to attain a 600, but for anyone with verbal strengths aiming at a very high score, the words were simply too basic (e.g., words like ""abyss"" and ""rejuvenate"" that most people probably learned in the 5th grade). In addition, the GRE tests on more than the first or second word definition, and these cards only gave the most commonly used definition. I would have preferred cards that had an entire dictionary definition, complete with all possible meanings, on the back.So if your goal is to scrape by with a 600-650, this is a good set for you. If you're aiming any higher, you'll probably have to make your own flash cards based on harder word lists in study books."
3,more like flash book than cards,"this book is really helpful if you don't mind carrying around a strangely shaped book with super thin pages. The fold down tabs were helpful, but still didn't make the words function really as cards... it was more like flipping through the dictionary than using flashcards. clumsy book, but really helpful w/ each word... includes the definition, a sentence and synonyms. overall wouldn't purchase this over just making actual cards."
3,Easy to use,"The flashcards are easy to use and have most of the common and high frequency words of the GRE. However, they come as a book and detaching the cards from the book is a slight pain. Also, they contain only 1500 words. You would still need another book for the remaining 2000 words."
4,Good vocab builder,Loved the flashcards! It was so easy to tote the book around. Also like how it has synonyms of the words. Having antonyms would make it even better!
2,Good fit/No strap,"The S9000 fits perfectly in the case. Too bad the case has no strap and no belt loop. Apparently, the camera strap is supposed to function as the case strap also. Too bad the camera strap is extremely short, made for very small people. So, instead of returning it and using a generic case that would not protectthe camera as well, I will adapt the case to work for me. I will get a bigger aftermarket strap for the camera. I can take the case to my seamstress and have a belt loop sewn on. It will work but only after extensive modification. Great camera design so it's odd that the case appears to have been designed by someone who has never used a camera before."
1,Big Mistake to Purchase this Junk!,"This case is an overpriced nothing. It offers very minimal protection if any due to lack of padding. It has no handle, no strap, no belt loops. It is made overseas and not good for much of anything. Do yourself a favor and click away from this page...fast!"
5,nice and professional,These make a wonderful alternative to the normal 8 1/2 x 11 envelopes especially if you have a few pages which only requires one fold over to fit the envelope.
1,Terrible Product!!!!,"Please Note...The Glue,or adhesive is NOT effective..It does not hold and for safety,each envelope needs to be taped,on top and lower seam!!!"
5,Envelopes,I bought these because I sell products on EBAY and they are the right size for my product and they had a very reasonable price.
2,Not well made.,The slider for the temperature control did not work properly. There is no resistance to the adjustment until you get to a particular point so a large range of the temperature is not possible.
3,don't redeem Becker,"I loved, absolutely loved Prayer for the Dead and Close to the Bone. I was disappointed with this Becker book. I wanted more interaction between Becker and Swann and I definitely do not want Becker to lose his edge. I like my good guys bad and I am not happy with the watered down Becker. I read this book wanting the same walking on the line protagonist, but instead I got a ""I'm gonna change my ways"" protagonist. I feel that this is the same way John Sandford's Prey series has changed. Don't redeem our good guys, we want them real, frustrated and walking on the line between good and evil."
5,Right Stuff,"I read Joe Konrath's list of the scariest thrillers and saw that he listed David Wiltse's Into The Fire as number one so I ran out and got a copy and I have to say that Joe is at least half right. This is one very scary book but Wiltse's The Serpent is just as scary if not maybe an ounce scarier. But, hey, when you're so scared you're reading under the cvers with every light in the house on and your back against the wall, what difference does it make if the book is number one or number one and one eighth?"
3,Really old book,"This is a good book with lots of tried and true design tips, but if you're looking to redesign your newsletter and give it a ""current"" feel, be forwarned: this book is almost 10 years old, and the sample newsletters they feature show it. I think it's a good book, but given its age it should be cheaper."
5,Berg receiver review,This receiver is an excellent product. It is economical and works very well the 72 mhz Hitec transmitters I use. I would highly recommend this product to anyone not using 2.4 ghz technology. Very reasonably priced as well...
4,MOONEY SUZUKI ROCK,"A good disc by a really good band, but not a great one. If you want to really hear GREAT ROCK N ROLL, go and buy the THE FLAMING SIDEBURNS disc ""SAVE ROCK N ROLL""! They played with MS last week and totally blew them away... A much better investment of your money and a MUCH BETTER BAND."
1,Why the Hype?,"I expected great things from this album after buying the ""Your love is a gentle whip"" 7"". I listened to this album one time and never picked it up again. I don't know why this band is being hyped now, there is better ""garage rock"" out there, like Supercharger, The No-talents, and Teengenerate. If you are new to the whole garage rock thing go elsewhere."
5,The Bottom Line,"From the distorted guitar start of ""People Get Ready"" to its soulful finish, the Mooney Suzuki proves beyond the shadow of doubt that great American rock still exists. What this album lacks in depth in more than makes up for with attitude. This is roots rock the way it was originally created. After giving this one a listen you can list about 100 bands that they remind you of, yet borrow absolutely nothing. The Mooney Suzuki have a very distinct sound in a somewhat cloned genre. I believe most reviewers are a little too liberal with the 5 star rating, but I feel I can deem this one an ""underground"" classic."
2,"Not bad, but a big letdown.","This album isn't that bad, just not that good. It's obvious from this album that their strength is their live show. If you haven't seen them live yet, you should, if just once. Theres no need to see them twice. You get the idea. I'm afraid that the main weakness of this album is the rather mediocre songs. Good raw production, and the guitars have a lot of power, but that can't hide the fact that the songs are pretty .... I bought this album after seeing them play live. You probably will too. Their live show must have tricked me into thinking these were good songs. Oh well, at least The Mc5 had some good tunes. Back In The USA is 6000 times better than this. Better luck next time boys."
3,"Sounds cool at first, then gets old","I'm very glad that I downloaded this album instead of buying it. The first few times I listened to it, I thought it was the coolest, greatest thing ever. But then I realized that almost all the songs are in the same key, and that the singer had to be the worst lyricist in the history of man. My advice is: go ahead and download this. Maybe you'll like it, maybe you won't. Just remember to save your money for something truly great like Elf Power's opus Creatures or the new Sigur Ros album that will be released next week (I can hardly wait!)."
4,Fun,"It's not often I listen to a cd and am so excited I want to call all my friends one by one to tell them about it. With The Mooney Suzuki that was the case. A little Creation, some Kinks and some Who, and a little of The Ramones and Mudhoney's playfulness. All in a style they've molded into their own. Seeing these guys live is a treat that you should not miss out on...these guys rock."
5,Refreshing and soothing music,"This CD is reminiscent of the folk music of the 60's...it is refreshing, soothing, and easy listening. A great way to let music take you back to simpler times... The artists are talented and creative and give new meaning to the word harmony,and their music is created from the heart. Best of all, it's all original, from the instruments created by Chris as the luthier to the music and lyrics created by Erin and Rich. Try it, you'll like it!"
2,Disappointing,After all the hype I ordered Innkeepers expecting to experience some chills. I honestly don't know where people think that there was ever any real terror or scary moments in this film. Is it really too much to ask for a horror movie to be scary?
1,Stay away,"Stay away, very boring, cast has the acting range of a daisy air rifle. I was very disappointed. I'm glad I only rented it."
1,bomb,This is absolutely one of the worst movies in the horror/ghost category ever made. The only scary parts were listening to the coffee clerk talk about her boyfriend. If you take anything away from this review please know I watched hundreds of movies each year and this is one of the worst I have EVER seen. And what is sad is that it is a great idea for a movie.
2,DO NOT EVEN RENT!,"My friend posted on facebook how this is the best film of the year...wow i know good movies seem way to few and far between these days but this movie SUCKED. Thank god i spent only 4 bucks to rent it off amazon. Trust me guys this movie has like 2 scares MAYBE with little real plot and storytelling. PLEASE stay far away from this one, the acting is awful, the story (what story) is just awful, and the ending (cant even spoil it for you as there is no ending). It was a chore to get through and when you are finished you should expect mony to see it!"
1,***WORST HORROR MOVIE EVER MADE***,"I can't believe that some people liked this pile of cliches badly acted, badly written and badly directed.The fault is not due to a lack of budget, but rather a lack of talent and skill at every level.In one word, HORRENDOUS!"
1,DONT BUY,"I love horror movies, I even love ones that are bad in a good way if you know what I mean. the kinda movies where the acting and the effects are bad but its still enjoyable because its funny or ridiculous. well this is not one of those films. Its just all around bad. the plot or lack there of, doesnt lead to anything and it doesnt build the characters in anyway. there are lots of random scenes that are totally unnecessary and leave you asking yourself ""why?"". The female character is the most unbelievable, with her constant awkward interactions with the other characters and her reactions to situations. Its an awful mix of terrible directing and Sh*t acting. bottom line dont waste your time you wont get a laugh or a scare."
1,Innkeepers,"At a small haunted New England hotel, it's almost time to close up for the season. There are two employees left who both are ghost hunters and they try to solve the mystery of the hauntings. There are only a few guest one is a fading actress who is actually played by an actress that hasn't been seen in a movie for quite some time, Kelly McGillis. The other is a mother and son who left because the female workers hears something and rushes downstairs in her underwear. The movie is very, very, slow paced and nothing really happens. It's not the trailer they promoted for the films limited release.Overall, aside from a few blue words and a suicide, this movie can pass as a PG film. I watched it for an hour and eleven minutes and nothing happened at all. It was boring, i'll admit I did fast foward thru most of the last thirty minutes do to boredom. I'd avoid this stinker and go watch Open Season instead."
4,Horror with an attention span,"This is the way horror films used to be. When there wasn't a sliced torso or a gouged eyeball every few minutes, filmmakers relied upon the viewers' imagination to fill in the dark places. They knew that what we didn't see what scarier than what they could show us. Ti West knows this and fills most of The Innkeepers with our imagination. If you want an ADHD roller coaster of gore and action, go watch Final Destination 5 or whatever the latest Saw movie was. If you enjoy your horror with a slow build-up of suspense and creepiness, The Innkeepers is for you."
2,Not very intriguing,Trailer tricked me. Movie was vague. There were no scary parts really. I wish they would have taken more time on this movie.
1,THE INN KEEPERS ( SLEEP AID ),"One must wait for this movie to be either a gift , or maybe pay a dollar . The only thing it did for me was to put me to sleep . Maybe Sominex sleeping pills can add this film to their product ; IF YOU BUY THE ECONOMY SIZE , YOU GET THIS FREE MOVIE ! I can see it at wallgreens pharmacy section now ."
1,The Innkeepers,"This movie was very boring and slow, it sucks all the way to the end, i do not recommend it at all, the cast was excellent but the story did not give any thrills, don't spend your money."
3,Just average.,"An old hotel is closing and it may be haunted. The final two staffers are overseeing the departing guests and trying to make contact with the spirits that may be inhabiting the place. The film has its instants of creepiness, but it often relies on the old horror film gimmick of cheap frights, and doesn't provide enough truly scary moments. Moreover, I found the finale unsatisfying, not providing enough of an explanation for what I had just seen. The makings of a good horror movie are present; I just don't think the execution is adequate. This is another low-budget horror effort from Ti West, and this time he disappoints."
4,Well Done Thriller,A worthwhile slow building suspense. You get to know and like the main characters which invests you in their fates. Not a slasher or scare-a-minute type horror movie but well worth it.
1,this sucked,this movie just sucked i want my hour and a half back no plot or resolution so dissapointing will not bw recommending this to anyone
3,hotel basements to stay away from.,Good movie with a very slow start. This movie relies heavily on loud sounds that will make you jump out of your seat.
2,B horror flick for teens,"Just finished Innkeeper... Well it never really amounted to much. It is slow to start and didn't take advantage of any of the truly interesting possible story points. I would reccomend this movie for a bunch of 12 year old girls looking for a slumber party bubble gum thriller.the whole movie likened itself to standing in front of a dark bathroom mirror and repeating bloody Mary the end result is about the same, A waste of time with nothing to show for it."
3,Just okay.,"An old hotel is closing and it may be haunted. The final two staffers are overseeing the departing guests and trying to make contact with the spirits that may be inhabiting the place. The film has its instants of creepiness, but it often relies on the old horror film gimmick of cheap frights, and doesn't provide enough truly scary moments.

The makings of a good horror movie are present; I just don't think the execution is adequate. This is another low-budget horror effort from Ti West, and this time he disappoints."
2,Let Down!,"This movie was a very big let down! I read many reviews that said how Ti West's movies keep you on the edge of your seat and that they are good, but this movie to me was very boring and dull. They did not even show a ghost until toward the end of the movie. Plus the ending left me confused about if the girl involved was imagining these things or if there was actual ghosts. If you are a true horror fan or like ghost movies stay away from this movie."
1,BORING,"Nothing happens. Much screaming from female lead who is startled by every event around her, though they consist only of encountering her co- worker and guests. Maybe something happens eventually, but I couldn't hold out long enough.Be bored: be very bored.Actually, it didn't rate a whole star."
4,Fun with scares,Enjoyed this because it had humor and some scares. Overall enjoyable movie. The actors seemed to have a good time with it and it helped that it was filmed near my home
2,Creepy but aimless,"The atmosphere and scares were effective toward old fashioned gothic style horror - my favorite kind. The movie had a different feel to it than most horror films; quiet and intentionally slow moving. The camera work really kept me interested but in the end, the drudging pace and lack of any point kills this movie before - in the last 20 minutes - it has a chance to redeem itself which it fails at. Why? Becasue there is absolutely no reason for anything in this film. Not the ghosts, not the ghosts' stories not the guests and not the freeking inkeepers! Pat Heely as Luke was fun to watch and I love his acting in this. He's amusing but I can take him seriously. I think his quality gave this movie that different edge. Sara Paxton's [main character] acting was mostly good but at times, her attempts at 'cute, geeky and quirky' were cringe worthy and took me way out of the film.Ultimately, this movie was all dressed up in the trappings of gothic horror but nowhere to go=["
2,The Innkeepers,"This is a made for TV movie. There is a reason it should not be a major studio release. Starts out nice, nice characters, great soundtrack, but is a complete letdown at the conclusion. Watched the trailer, listened to film hyped on Opie and Anthony, spent the 10 bucks. Cheap scares (for a 13 year old) and no grand conclusion. May take a look at House of the Devil. Director has a bright future but needs a script with some bite."
3,A lot of nothing,"It's a cute and pleasant movie about a cute and pleasant girl that's one of the last remaining employees at an alleged haunted hotel that's only going to be open to guests for one more night before it's closed for good. Nothing really happens except cute and pleasant chit-chat until the last 20 minutes and even then, it isn't particularly suspenseful or scary. It wasn't a bad movie but it's not particularly interesting either. Really dumb ending, one of those where you think ""why are you going in there?"""
3,"Loved the atomosphere, story; unsatisfying ending--mystery never resolved","I really loved most of this movie--an old, eerie hotel with a past and two employees left alone all night, etc., etc. I loved the ""old school spookiness"" and that it did not rely on cheesey CGI or super-gore for a scare. But the ""mystery"" made completely no sense at all and when it was over, I said, ""THAT'S IT??? What's the point?"" There's no resolution to the mystery at which really about ticks a viewer off. I ""supposed"" (since nothing in the movie indicates for sure) the old man at the end of the movie may have been the ghost's husband or to-be husband or whatever ... but that would be impossible unless the old man was over 100 years old ... so WHO WAS HE??? What?? The ending made no sense and your left just really feeling let down. It was really a great ""old-fashioned"" spooky movie up until the end. In short--good spook movie but the ending made me feel ripped off."
5,"Classic, Old School Suspense","This film was done with all the mastery of old-school horror flicks, not too much gore, no torture, but just an uneasiness that builds into terror. It has that wonderful cliche of ""why is she going in there by herself!"" It does borrow from The Shining. The camera work is simple, clean, and beautifully done. And the best part are the questions at the end...the story is resolved. But is it really? Was it all paranormal or were the incidences caused by human agency? I LOVED IT!!! *warning* This flick requires the use of one's imagination, and if you want everything done for you (special effects, etc.) you won't like it."
2,"No atmosphere, tension or mystery",This movie is incredibly boring. Forty minutes in and absolutely NOTHING has happened. I was falling asleep. Had to switch it off.
2,whatever,not a bad movie but barely keeping me interested enough to watch. i am about half way though it at this point and plan i watching it through. dont expect anything great coming out of this though.
2,Snore,Fell asleep watching it until the volume blared during a 'ghost appearance'. Fell back asleep and it did it again! Watched end next day. Boring.
2,Doesn't add up to much,"Somewhere buried under a lot of tedium is the basis for a rather gentle and mildly amusing comedy about people running an historic hotel that has seen better days. However..a lot of poorly handled supernatural claptrap has been thickly applied. Early on there was a faint suggestion that it may actually have gotten somewhere..it might even have been an intelligent and creepily atmospheric thriller. It isn't. It's plodding, predictable and lame with a script that appears to have been written by a schoolgirl with an interest in the spooks. Far from being a classic of any kind. It'll leave you cold and feeling cheated and guilty that you spent the better part of two hours on it if indeed you can last that long."
2,I wish I knew what I just watched?,"WOW how to rate this HORROR flick? I can honestly say I watched this twice just to be sure I'm not that stupid but I still can't answer that question because after 2 times I still don't have a clue what the heck happened in this movie. Is it good or bad I don't know it it entertaining, sure I guess so, does it keep you on your toes, that's an understatement. I just wish I knew what was going on, what's the plot, how does it end? Did it end? I know it stopped and I'm glad of that but you can be I won't watch it a 3rd time..."
3,Could have been SO much better!,This movie was okay with the potential to have been SO much better. Sadly the good parts were withheld until about the last 15 minutes. I would not watch it again but I would recommend fans of hauntings give it a shot.
1,Innkeeper,Not worth the money. Made a big mistake of buying it. Looks good in the trailer but once u see its totally different
2,Not worth the rental...,What a let down. The trailer made it look good but it fell flat. The weak story line got so drawn out I lost interest. I was pretty excited about this film too.
1,Lackluster Rehash of Ideas Better Executed Elsewhere,"The Innkeepers offers a low-rent riff on The Shining. There's no isolation to bump the suspense- the characters can leave the spooky hotel any time they want. The characters are two-dimensional. There is little originality, wit or development here. Just another by-the-numbers collection of set pieces that have been copied over and over by various hacks. Skip it."
2,Not worth ten bucks,"The movie started out fun but it was very slow, then out of no where it got scary in the last 5 minutes. This movie was not worth ten bucks, more like 4 bucks."
1,Wish I could get my money back!,"This movie was awful. It took forever for the ""action"" to start. It was boring and made no sense. i really wish I didn't spend $3.99."
5,Spooky Ghosts,"I definitely think Ti West is one of the best directors working today after seeing this movie.I used to have mixed feelings about him before because I loved Trigger Man but hated House of the Devil and The Roost. I thought Cabin Fever 2 was okay.The Innkeepers is just an excellent movie through and through, though it seems like nothing happens until the very end the build up is just as enjoyable.The fact that the characters are so likeable and so well developed makes what happens at the end so much scarier.Normally i hate ghost movies but this was just great.Sarah Paxton carries the movie almost entirely by herself and gives one of the best performances I have seen in any movie in years.This comes right after seeing her in Shark Night, a decent movie which is improved by her presence alone.From now on I will look forward to any movies that Ti West or Sarah Paxton do.The Innkeepers is brilliant."
1,Stupid,"This movie is boring, stupid and the acting is horrible. When the girl tried to scare the guy by coming out in a sheet with eye holes, I was all done with it."
1,Cheap Horror Flick,"What a horrible movie. Horror movies that rely on a few cheap shots of ghostly figures suddenly appearing on screen instead of a true sense of horror should be barred. Additionally, I am sure that Sara Paxton is a good actress, but I would rather be locked in the Inn's basement than watch this movie again. Her apathetic nature and childish acting made a horribly written movie that much worse. Save the 3.99 on the rental and just drop an anvil on your foot. The rush will be about the same."
1,Moat Boring Ghost Story Ever,"Nothing happens until the last 30 minutes and even that wasn't worth waiting for; I found myself answering email, checking out CNN.com and fast forwarding to see if there was something at all intelligent or interesting about this story. The acting is over-the-top ridiculous, loooong panning with the camera, making me think that they were trying to fill up empty time with long pans. Nothing is ever explained, the dots don't connect. Ending is hackneyed and completely predictable. Great big bore and poorly done. If you want a good ghost story, rent ""The Haunting"" (not the Liam Neeson version, though I adore him; get the Claire Bloom version) or better still ""The Innocents."" Sheesh, even Paranormal Activity was better than this."
2,Not the good kind of BOO!,"The Innkeepers was a movie I was most excited to see due to it's ""fresh rating"" on rotten tomatoes website. Just watched it and in the 101 minutes this film ran, only a handful of scares were there. This movie is slow and the characters are very hard to root for. By the end of the film I didn't care if everyone in the hotel died. The story of the ghost in the Yankee Pedlar Inn was vague and never provided answers for the viewers. Boooooooo!"
2,Movie just ended...no real resolution.,"Did have some scary parts though. Some of the cinematography was pretty good. Acting was also suprisingly decent, too. 2.5."
2,Slow,"Very slow moving. The problem with this film is the writing itself. The story is just dull. The dialogue is just dull. The movie has competent enough actors, but they tended to over act with a lifeless script. The climax is pretty good, but I have seen better. But I don't know if I would want to sit through this just to see a 5 minute climatic scene.Good for a Redbox rental if you have seen everything else in the box."
2,Creates a great atmosphere but the plot fails to deliver,"This story is set up fantastically--and in the beginning it seems to have promise; but it is very slow with no real big scares. The climax of the movie should have been a bit more drawn out and just utterly fails to deliver. At the end of the film all I could think was: ""what the heck just happened...seriously, that's the end?!"" Not very eloquent, but if you rent this movie, you may find yourself saying the same thing!Regarding the acting, I thought the male lead did a credible job but I did not like the female lead. Her acting seemed a bit forced and her character was somewhat annoying--which was not her fault but made it hard to watch."
5,It's a Keeper,"No this movie was not perfect, but for the first time in about 20 years while watching a move, I hid my eyes and actually let out an exclamation twice - that is no small feat for me. I don't get scared by scary movies, but this one scared me. I loved the long slow build up, it was needed to make the scary bits really scary. Oh man. If you love, I mean really love, haunted house movies, revel in this. I just might have nightmares tonight and I can't say that after having watched about a hundred other scary movies in my lifetime. That's all I'm gonna say. Be patient and stick with it. I was glad I did."
2,Scary Boring,"I was expecting a quality horror movie but I got was snooze fest. Both actors in this movie are terrible, they have no acting skill and the plot is big enough to drive a truck through. I can't believe i paid $10 for this movie. The reason i gave two stars is for the ending. Most of five star reviews are from family and friends of cast and crew who had no prior reviews."
2,Almost Good!,This movie was decent up until the horrible ending. Really not expected in a comedy/horror pic. If you watch it be ready to be disappointed.
2,"Horrible move, but not in a good way!","The movie started engaging enough, but shortly it turns into a bad school film project. The thing that annoys me the most is the holes in the logic. Many things do not make sense!Don't waste your time watching this."
2,Not worth it,"Based on the movie's ""popularity"" I decided to give it a shot. I honestly wish that I hadn't. The acting was mediocre given the movie's low budget but still somewhat convincing.The first half or so is filled with such promise. The ending however, is filled with nothing but disappointment. Pass on this one unless you are really bored."
2,Very dull; takes too long for any payoff to happen,This movie was so dull and plodding that I could barely stay awake. It took much too long for anything at all to happen and then the payoff was dissatisfying.
2,"Boring, Could have Been a TV Movie","I am not a huge horror genre fan, but I love suspense and really enjoy good haunted house movies, but this one doesn't satisfy on either front.I had seen the star in a Lifetime movie called ""The Blue Eyed Butcher"" and was eager to see her in something else, but at the end of this one, all I could think was, the Lifetime movie was so much better. In fact, this could have been one of those TV-movie attempts at a haunted house flick. I agree with the other reviewers that it is quite boring (I had to stop and start it several times over the 48 hour rental period just to get through and that's very unusual for me.).There are only one or two decent scares and the suspense just isn't good enough to make that OK. And in the end there isn't enough of a story to make the lack of scares and suspense OK, either.I definitely regret paying to stream this one. Wait for it to come on cable if you want to give it a try."
3,Clerks meets Ghost Hunters,"Not a bad little ghost story, but it ultimately wasn't that scary. Really just a good movie for a slumber party, sitting around, teasing the actors, and talking back to the screen."
3,"Good, but not great.","This was a pretty decent ghost movie with a few bits of humor thrown in, but the ending left me asking ""Was that it?"". I was expecting some resolution, some reason behind it all, but there was nothing. Just your basic ghost story that just sort of happened to this group of people and then....the end.Aside from that it had some good visuals, spooky moments, and good acting. The potential was there for it to be a lot more than it was."
4,i am a ti west fan,"do not know if i like it better or not as much as house of the devil but there is my point. If you liked house of the devil than you will like this. If you didn't like House than move in. Regardless, it is a good independent horror film. beats most horror hollywood puts out nowadays."
1,Not worth the price (even for free on Prime),"I love scary movies, but this was one of the worst I've ever seen. There is little to no character development, the plot moves at a snail's pace, mysteries are raised and unresolved, and the end is entirely unsatisfying. Boring, boring, boring."
1,"Zero stars please, save your money!!!!!!","Junk movie, awful acting, story and scares. The scariest part is that I paid money to watch this junk. This movie was incredibly predictable to say the least and was more amusing than scary."
2,A fair follow-up to the great House of the Devil,I was pretty underwhelmed by this one. It is the same director who did House of the Devil which is one of the best horror movies of the last decade. This movie is set in a hotel set to be shut down which is supposed to be haunted. The two remaining employees spend their last quiet weekend trying to find evidence that there is a ghost. That's about it. There are some creepy scenes but I feel this could have been a TV movie just the same.
1,Why.,"Borinnnnnnng. nothing happens until the last 25 minutes. Why. Ti. Why. This had potentinal. From the poster alone it looked awesome. But no. Its not. I really wish i would've chose to Sleep instead of watching this at 4 am. Please Ti, in your next film(s) stop with the dialog heavy, boring scenes and typical fake scares."
1,The Innkeepers,"Too slow-moving when the climax is there it couldn't get there soon enough and naturally predictable.Boring at times,and when the ""Horror"" did come it was gross in an bad and distasteful.The movie is more of an thriller than an horror movie,Glad I watched it on Netflix instant first than renting it or owning it.Not enough scares to be scary and not interesting enough for me to watch again."
2,Disappointing,"I love scary movies and do not like ones with gore, so I was truly hopeful when starting this film. The plot never developed and the characters, while well acted, lacked motivation and purpose. The plot line seemed focused on setting up scenes that were expectant with something scary just about to happen, but I couldn't stop thinking, ""so what?"" There were a couple of times where I found myself tensing up, but then I found myself thinking how stupid the story line was. The ending really ruined it for me, it seemed just plain stupid. I hate giving negative feedback about someone else's artwork, and there were good things about this film but I felt it was a flop. Sorry."
2,"Nice photos, but the recipes are marginal.","Better glycerin Melt & Pour soap recipes can be found for free on the Internet. As usual, this somewhat spacey author ignores known hazards of certain essential oils and recommends unqualified use of them. 'Baby's Bottom Repair Soap' made with chemical-based Melt & Pour glycerin and Balsam of Peru is a recipe for disaster. 'Balsam of Peru & Benzoin Anti-Itch Soap' is even worse. Think at least twice twice before making her 'Pine Tar Soap and Shampoo Bar'. All of the essential oils mentioned can be extreme sensitizers. Her New Age drivel on Sunshine, Moonbeam and Lightning Water products are totally over the edge. Basically, this book is for people who enjoy talking to plants."
3,Not for beginers....,"I noticed that this book is lacking of showing how to work with the glycerine in order to make this soaps. I don't believe this book is for beginers in soapmaking. Other than that, it has nice photos!"
3,Mix of Good and Bad Ideas,"""Soothing Soaps"" is good for those wanting to make glycerin based ""melt and pour"" soaps or those working on developing their own soap lines, like us. We own a small business that is branching into ""bath and body"" products and recently added this book to the growing library we use for research.While we like the idea of growing and using our own additives, the addition of New Age philosophy in the early chapters is a bit of a distraction for us. The recipes themselves are generally good and easy to follow, with many color pictures to show what the finished product should look like, which is always helpful.This is not the best resource, but it is worthwhile if you are new to melt and pour soaps.CFH"
3,Good lil book for ideas.,"This is a nice lil book for ideas for healing soaps I use it more for the combinations of essential oils than the actual soap recipes. If you are new to soapmaking I would pair this with the book by Anne Watson called ""Smart Soapmaking"" and its always a good idea to get at least a couple good aromatherapy books to help figure out scenting and what goes well and what each oils properties are some oils although they smell good are not meant for every type of person to use its important to know what effects they can have on you, your families and or customers."
1,Not from scratch,All soaps are glycerine based. Which means you have to find a supplier that is not too expensive! If it is a transparent soap you are after buy - The Soapmakers Companion by Susan Miller Cavitch. It has a transparent soap recipe and a ton of other recipes for many different and creative soaps. I could make up my own recipes if all I was doing was remelting the soap and adding new ingredients!
1,It was horrible. It had no feeling and made me sleep.,It had good information and facts. It seemed to be based on a true story but still did not fit in. The book itself did not flow. It had no rythm and I feel it does not deserve good reviews. The writer herself is good but not the book.
2,Glycerin soap? Who knew!,"I own another soap making book from Sandy Maine and enjoy it very much, so decided to try another one. After purchasing it from Amazon, I quickly realized that this book is strictly glycerine soaps. There was no indication of this from what I could tell. I wanted a book on actual soap making, not pre-made soap enhanced by botanicals. In summary, the title or book summary should mention that this book is about melt and pour soap only. Consequently, I returned the book."
2,Not what you might expect,"The soaps are truly beautiful to look at with all the different colors and textures. I expected recipes for cold process soap and not the use of melt and pour bases so I am not completely pleased with this book. Depending on where you reside, some of the ingredients listed in various recipes may be harder to find while other ingredients in my opinion are quite questionable for skincare use. Tincture of benzoin for example is a known sensitizer and is therefore something I would not use in any skincare product. The photos were extremely lovely and I did enjoy reading how to make decoctions, infusions and oils."
3,"Interesting, very basic glycerine soap recipes for beginners","This book of glycerine soap recipes is an easy and fun read that I would recommend for the very nervous, first-time soapmakers. Glycerine soap base is easy to pick up at Wal-Mart or online, and the recipes provide information for adding herbs, oils, and healing blends. Some of the recipes get a little far-out--calling for rainwater collected during a lightning storm, for example--but you never know which customers may be really enthralled by ""Lightning Water Soap""! This is just a basic, fun, easy book that, while not an invaluable resource, might be a nice additon to your collection of soapcrafting books."
4,A truly cushy seat,"The gel in the Trico PainReliever Saddle Pad makes this a truly cushy bike seat. Maybe even a little too cushy - it took some getting used to because your body shifts a bit since it's so thick. But the saddle pad makes for a very comfortable ride.One of the main reasons I bought this is that we often rent bikes. The first time I rode a bike without any padding in the seat, I was in discomfort whenever I rode and for several days afterwards. Now I can pack comfort in my suitcase that will slip over any bike seat I rent.The sizing (Trico offers 3 sizes) was a little tricky. This saddle pad is slightly smaller than my bike seat; although the stretch cover fabric and drawstring allowed for a good fit."
3,A good read but a lot of editing errors.,"I enjoyed ""French lessons"" because I was familiar with anglophone Africa through extensive travels there some years back. It certainly struck a familiar chord. The best book I've read on Africa is ""The Africans"" (forgot author's name). This is up there but it is a bit inconsistent. The version I read had typos and strange cuts. It was often hard to tell who was talking with the dialogue and the reader needs a reasonable knowledge of French to get a lot of the jokes. I loved the descriptions of the meetings with ministers etc but I never worked out what our hero did for a living or what he was actually doing in these countries. As one reviewer said it's a bit dated but I'd read a new version if it came out."
3,A bit dry but covers the basics VERY well,You'll understand the concepts if not exactly the execution of VPNs and the various methods of implementing them. Be sure to get training specific to your product and methodology before considering this your only purchase.
2,Ceramic Crock lids break easily,I've now had two ceramic compost crocks that have suffered the same fate: the lid slipped out of my hand and broke on the counter. I have bought my last ceramic crock. From now on I am going with a stainless steel model.
2,"Attractive, but not durable...","My husband received this ceramic crock as a gift two weeks ago. Last night as he went to lift it by the handle to move it, one of the knobs that the handle attaches to snapped off. We were disappointed but not ultimately suprised as this thing weighs quite a bit. The handle itself is heavy duty but the knobs used to attach it to the crock are just not beefy enough to support the weight of this thing. I called Plow and Hearth and they are giving a full refund to the gift-giver and I am pleased with how they responded.If you want something pretty to keep your scraps in, this is great, just don't pick it up by the handle."
1,Disappointed with this product,"I received the compost crock yesterday. The crock was sturdy with a nice rugged swing handle, however I was disappointed that the cover did not fit well no matter how much I turned it around on the top of the pot. Even more disappointed that there were no instructions on how this works or what to put in it or not put in it. This is my first stab at this. Guess I'll have to google it. Oh, and one more thing, I only ordered one crock, my shipping was free if purchasing a certain dollar amount. On that same day, there was a second crock delivered with a postage due of 10 plus dollars. Hmmm.... I, obviously, refused the second one. I would not order from this company again."
1,This toy doesn't work,I bought this for my son and took it back to the store the same day. It doesn't work at all and the graphics are terrible. The only thing it did well was make a lot of noise by playing the annoying power ranger theme song over and over.Avoid this toy at all costs.
3,only 3 star because I did not have the two tone,"My girl friend got me this watch about 10 years ago. Mine was not a expansion band so I had to put a bigger one on. The watch all in all held up pretty good. I decided to just get a new watch now that the battery has died but it lasted 10 years. My watch witch is just silver and not 2 tone I would give 4 stars. The Acqua watch is made by Timex and they use a lot of silver brass for the case. After about 8 years around the bottom by the battery case started to oxidize. The indiglo just now went out and the watch started to lose time so it is the battery. If you can find this watch in just silver tone I would highly recommend it. I wore it every day swimming, working on cars and trucks, the lens held up only about 4 small scratches over the years. Also mine had a black face and the indiglo was still nice so in white it would be bright. I just don't know about how good the 2 tone color would hold up."
1,misleading slogan,"this tshirt is misleading. it suggests that its a funny slogan tshirt. this is bogus. if u where this people might get the wrong impression of u, unless u want them to think u like the devil."
1,Not good enough for even one star...,"I bought this watch used and with low expectations, and boy were they justified. I knew it wasn't going to be an amazing bargain Swiss watch clone. I had hoped it would be a quality-on-a-budget watch; nice enough. It was not. Even at half-price, it was an overpriced piece of crap.Although pretty, it lost nearly a minute per day, the day function didn't stay synchronized with the time, you could hear the low-quality winding mechanism grinding away as you moved your wrist (winding the watch), and the ""sweep second hand"" was more like ""spastic second hand.""Please, don't buy into the marketing hype. No quality watch maker advertises in SkyMall and also sells spring-loaded shoe insoles through their website. Anyone who knows anything about watches will spot this thing a mile away and think you a fool for being suckered into buying one.Mine's going up for sale on a popular online auction site this evening."
3,good watch,I have had this watch for about 3 years. It looks amazing and I have had dozens of compliments on it. The only problem is you have to wear it 24/7 If you set it down for even one day the movement will stop and you have to re-set it. Other than that it is o.k.
3,"Handsome watch, but the bands wear out fast.","My wife bought this watch for me about 2 years ago as a father's day present. Overall, I've been fairly satisfied with it. It has kept pretty good time; over the course of a week mine gains a minute or two. The day of week dial and date also work well, however the month dial stopped working after about a year (I am planning to take the watch in for repairs soon). My biggest complaint is the band. The two bands that came with it wore out in the first year. Replacement bands are hard to find; generic watch bands do not work due to the unusual attachment. I had to go directly through Steinhausen and pay $20 a band, and the replacement wore out over the course of a couple months. The weak spot is where the leather wraps around the pin holding the band to the watch."
2,Not What I Was Expecting,"I pre-purchased this DVD, so I didn't know much about it. I love Joseph Hill, so I assumed it would be good. He was a great musician, so my expectations were high for this ""Salute"" to him, but my expectations were not met. For the price I paid, I expected a more professional video, with more well known artists. Although, I am not sorry that I bought the DVD as I am happy to support up and coming artists, such as his son Kenyatta Hill."
5,An important work,"This is an important book that helps us prepare for a future where we recognize and appreciate the great strengths women bring to law enforcement. By understanding the global perspectives of women in law enforcement, we can begin to eliminate the stereotypes and encourage the entry and success of more women into this noble profession."
4,Great look - Curious function,"The watch is a really great looking watch, it is very handsome. I am very curious as to the operation of the watch, and I'm a little confused about the function of it.The ""second hand"" doesn't seem to act like a normal ""second hand"". On my watch it appears that it acts as the stop watch, while the dial in the very middle, on the bottom acts as the ""second hand"".The dial on the right hand side, I understand, it represents the hour of the day. However, the dial on the left hand side, I haven't figured out its purpose as of yet."
5,Great!,Bought this gift for a Christmas present. Was exactly what I had expected. It does crack any size nut. The receiver did like this squirrel nut cracker very much.
2,Goofy product,I should have known this was just a knick knack. Tried using it for hazelnuts and the two sides of nutcracker split apart.
5,I gave it as a gift to my daughter. She and my granddaughter love it.,I chose this nut cracker for the look. My daughter and granddaughter love cracking fresh pecans with this cute nutcracker.
1,Not a functional nut cracker.,"My neice bought me this nut cracker for my birthday and had only purchased it after reading good reviews on Amazon. In the reviews, people had written that it not only looked nice but was also fully functional; this is completely untrue. It is a difficult task to crack any number of nuts and if u do manage to open any, without smashing your hand on the table, what you're going to get is a smashed up mess of shell and nut. Don't buy this product for functionality, and don't pack up the nut crackers just yet!"
1,Not practical at all!!!,"Very poor design and extremely frail. Doesn't do well with any nuts bigger than an almond, and even for smaller ones it was quite challenging. The whole truth about this ""made out of heavy duty cast aluminum"" tool is that it is indeed heavy, and it cracked wide open (in the two metal halves kept together by a tiny screw), as I tried to use it on a California nut. Try to buy something else."
4,Nice look not durable,"It looks nice for a gift .but it will spend its time more on the shelf than being used for cracking. in spite of that, I liked it ."
3,A little Squirrely,"Looks good, feels good, made well, but the top of the squirrels mouth is empty and the nuts get crammed up in there and I ended up having to dig them out...the bottom part of the jaw is like a pair of pliers so it is a great, but the top has two ridges I assume to ""hold"" the nut...Crunching the nut is easy with the big tail to provide leverage, BUT again, after crunching the nut, the gap tween the upper ridge gets jammed with nuts."
2,NUTCRACKER ????,"I WAS REALLY IN NEED FOR A GOOD NUTCRACKER TO HELP BUST THOSE LARGER NUTS.....I SAW THIS ONE ON LINE AND THOUGHT IT WAS JUST WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR. WELL TO MY SURPRISE, THIS WAS A GREAT LOOKING SQUIRREL BUT FAILED THE TEST OF CRACKING THOSE NUTS. WHEN THE NUTS WERE INSERTED, THE TAIL[HANDLE] WAS TO HIGH TO GET THE LEVERAGE NEEDED FOR THE PROPER PRESSURE TO CRACK THOSE BIG BOYS.....YOU REALLY NEEDED THREE HANDS TO DO THE JOB. WELL WE KEPT THE SQUIRREL ANYWAY CAUSE IT DOES MAKE A NICE TABLE ITEM FOR THE CHRISTMAS SETTING...I WOULD SAY IF YOU LIKE THE LITTLE FELLOW GO AHEAD AND BUY IT....... HAPPY HOLLIDAYS....."
3,"Cute, but not very practical.","I like squirrels, and this one is cute, but it's too light. Sometimes the nuts get jammed in under the chin and have to be dug out."
2,An Extraordinary Man Through Ordinary Glasses,"The author's praise of Casanova as an extraordinary man is belied by a rather ordinary Freudian analysis to which he is subjected. Of course, Casanova's biography is understandably irresistible to Freudian analysts, but any such analysis of this giant individual and champion individualist is necessarily reductive. The book is also non-chronological and the jumps in time are at times annoying, for all that a chronology is provided at the beginning of the book. I wished there were more quotes from Casanova's autobiography. I wished to see the passage of such a life unfold before me in its natural progression. I then realized that Casanova was such an incredible being that I wanted him to tell his own story. Realizing I was likely reading the wrong book, I ordered ""The History of My Life."""
2,Rambling psychological analysis,"After a recent trip to Venice I was extremely enthusiastic to start reading Cassanova: The Man Who Really Loved Women. I was immediately disappointed however, by the non-linear style which was quite painful to dredge through, though not as painful as Flem's psychological analysis of Cassanova's every action. As I understand it Ms. Flem is a Psychologist, so maybe I should have been forwarned, even so, she should have concentrated more heavily on the biographical information and allowed her readers to form their own ideas and conclusions."
3,Not at all what I thought,"I think this book tries to hard to be a psycho study then biography. The book shifts through the life of Casanova with no real path. While the book is far from bad I expected a little more biography, not his psychological study of his mind. More on the time period and the role he played in it woud have been great"
2,High Noon by Tex Ritter,"I already have these songs. I searched Tex Ritter songs: A Beautiful Life and Onward Christian Soldiers. I was sent to this CD, but it does not have these two songs. The CD has good songs, but not the one I want. Be careful to read the song lists on the CD before purchasing."
3,Quality does not come to mind,"I purchased these tweezers from Mr. Medical through Amazon.com. The tweezers I received look like the ones in the picture. I can say that they work, but they are very poor quality and finish. Made in Pakistan. Definitely not a quality item, though it isn't described as a name brand item, so I knew it was a gamble. No manufacturer stamp anywhere. There are crude tool marks all over, and the grips are cheaply stamped. edges poorly finished."
5,An excellent commentary on the book that James wrote,"Even though I have the priviledge of hearing Earl Palmer's sermons every Sunday, it was a joy to read his commentary on James. This commentary is ""plain talk,"" Earl calls it as he sees it, just as the writer of James does. This book would be perfect for a pastor doing a series on the book of James or for anyone who wants to better understand the practical advice that James gave the first century Christians as well as us today. In a world caught up in post-modernism, we need this practical advice of James."
3,A tray is a tray,"What can you say about a tray. It holds the solution and works well. The ridges on the bottom make it easier to pick up the paper. And you can easily differentiate the colors in the darkroom. This works well with smaller papers and when you are trying to save solution. However, you may choose to purchase the larger trays for the option of developing larger paper. You basically need both. You don't want to use a larger tray for smaller paper because you would have make more solution then you need, and of course, you can't use the smaller tray for larger papers."
4,The Scheme,"I liked this movie. Jimmy, of course, was great. I admit I'm a huge Jimmy Fallon fan. I even tape SNL because of him. But the rest of the cast was good too. Not as good as Jimmy, but heh, he's the star. The plot wasn't much, but then most movies are like this and when I watch a movie I don't want some dark, art thing that makes me despressed. This was light and funny and fast-paced. I don't know that I'd watch it again or buy it but I definately would recomend it as a rental. It's a great movie to watch with your boyfriend. The girls get Jimmy and the guys get some cute girls."
1,Beyond Wack,if it wasn't for Brian Hooks I wouldn't have watched this film.the Brother is Funny but this Film is Madd Corny.Jimmy Fallon is Wack.two Bit Laughs at most from him.this film Bored me.
1,The worst golf video I own,"The tripple coil power swing video, like other OHP videos, is of very low quality, showing an awkward looking swing technique that was inspired by a swing of a one-leged golfer. Explanations given by Milt Wallace are so bad that the OHP president has to help out. This video is a waste of time and money. I highly recommend you the golf video by Jim McLellan (...)"
2,Good band - poor product value for money,"I purchased the Alice Nine album ""Jewels"" for my daughter who was all excited about it. The price of the album was fairly expensive $20+ for an album is a bit much by U.S. standards. When the album arrived, she found out that it had TWO songs on it and ONE video (that's it folks).The group has many other fine albums most of which (I believe) must be ordered from Japan directly and we have since done that. They were more what we expected from this album - compilations of 7 to 9 songs.So, unless your a die-hard fan and understand this album is more like a ""single"" album in the U.S. be aware that your paying a good bit of money for an album that only has a couple of songs on it.Good group - not so great of a value for this particular ""Jewels"" album."
5,Great stress-management techniques....,"Personally, I think this book is easy to read and understand. The games presented in the book are unique and simple to apply. Many companys and businesses experience stress daily. Therefore, this book provides numerous ways to help relieve stress in the workplace. I strongly recommend this book."
3,The Big Book of Stress RElief Games,I use this in designing stress relief training programs. I like the approach it explains in having fun at work.
5,art encourages a passionate life,"And, eventually, I will survive on my art alone, as well. Until that day, there are women, bandit queens, outlaws for the emancipation of love and passion without oppression, who will pass through the real estate of my soul and heart and mind, leaving indelible reminders to live without the irrational fears and imagined boundaries I've collected, reminders to live and dare and question and dance and laugh and persevere and love and do exactly what I want to do for a living, never betraying my muse and never giving up without an honest fight. There is so much to admire and remember.Thanks to all the women involved in the creation of this work of art. Thanks to the memory of Phoolan Devi."
4,"Keep it cool-Save the dash, WV",Very pleased with this sun shade. Being the custom fit makes it stay in place w/very little effort. Definately keeps the sun out of my car. The only draw back w/this shade is it's a little bulky as far as rolling it up when your done with it. The well constructed manner of this shade out weighs the draw back for me.
3,Briefly amusing,"To be fair, I only bought this CD so I could get the song 'How Groovy' (sung by Shaggy in the movie). Most of the other tracks are Shaggy songs too but they're not as good. Louis Febre's score gets 1 track only and the final song is the Scooby Doo theme tune (sung by Shaggy again). I was kind of disappointed at this as in the movie it was sung by Jennifer Love Hewitt and I was hoping for her to be on the CD. She ain't.If you want more of the score and less of the songs then try to track down Louis Febre's very rare promotional CD. It lasts for 34 minutes and it's nothing but pure orchestral music with no songs. Scooby Doo and the Witches Ghost made for a better CD. But would have been worth it if JLH was included."
1,very disappointed!,"I'm heartbroken over this ring: I received it as a Christmas present from my boyfriend, and less than 24 hours later one of the pearls has already fallen out!"
5,This book is a must,"A lot of career information was packed into just 96 pages. Written in an easy-to-read style, ""Plants"" gives young people a chance to review many career choices for those who enjoy working with plants. The reader is offered a variety of choices of careers requiring PHD, MS, BS, or little education. The authors interviewed culturally diverse people with a variety of life stories to tell. They included information on salary, getting started, and education required. This book is a must for high school career centers and junior high libraries."
1,They look old and gross!!!,"I try to use recycled products when possible. This goes to whole new level. The envelopes look like theywere used before, not like they were made from recycled materials as the description states. I am not even sure I will be able to use them as they barely stick and they look so bad."
3,OK,The box arrived with the first few envelopes needing a little glue stick application because of the dust on the pre-glued area. Items really need a strip across them to protect the glue.
4,Very Decent Bench,"I picked up this bench to use with my Powertec Power Rack. I love the way the bench slides into the rack when your performing Incline, Decline bench or Shoulder Presses. Great looking bench as well.My gripe with this bench is that when your benching (flat bench), there is some sway on the back support. This can be improved by tightening the bolts, but guess what? When you tighten the bolts too much it makes changing positions very difficult. So its almost like you either keep the sway and have an adjustable bench or you remove the sway and lose your adjust-ability. I will probably end up picking up another bench solely for flat bench and keep this bench around for everything else.If it wasn't for this, I would have given this bench 5 stars."
1,Not Cassie's Best,"Savage Shadow has a lot of problems with its story. (1) The heroine and hero fall in love too quickly. They meet, and BAM, love. Not very realistic. (2) I find it hard to believe that someone who was not raise by their ""true father"" would call them ""Father"" so quickly. (3) The characters did not stick with one conviction. There were too many stories running at once in their minds, and this hurt the main story. (4) The story is boring. I made myself finish this book.Overall, I would not recommend this book to anyone just beginning to read Ms. Edwards. It's a big disappointment. Try ""Winter Raven"" instead."
1,Author didn't know her story to well.,HI! I recently read your book Savage Shadows and have to sayits the worst print I've read. Someone must've kept forgettingthe main dudes name. Is it Night Hawk or Running Hawk?I found alot of misprints or the author didn't plan to well.Also its like Cassie was in a hurry to start and finish her bookbecause the beginning seemed rushed.I've read some of theseries but this was the worst romance novel I've ever read.SORRY!!
4,savage shadows,"i couldnt put this book down, just as savage grace. i read to fast and didnt find to many miss prints and i dont know what all are talking about when they say it was the worst cassie ever did i thought it was great..."
2,not her best work,"I felt that Savage Shadows was one of Cassie Edwards worst books! Not only is it boring, but this whole name change thing just got on my nerves. I think Jae and Night (Running) Hawk get it on way too much and I think Edwards needed fillers. This book lacks action, if all I wanted was sex...I'd get a porno...sorry Cassie."
3,loved the book,savage shadows was a great book i couldn't keep my eyes off it. the action started from the begging of the book and lasted all the way through.
4,Most definitely worth a try!,"I have read some of the reviews and a lot of people seem to have read the book without giving the stuff a try. One person said if it was that easy, then everyone would be rich. Well there are a lot of books out there on dieting and how to quit smoking and how to get better at ""whatever"". The point. Only a certain percentage of people will try the stuff. There are tons of diet books sold each year and does everybody who read these books lose weight? It does take discipline and effort. And dare I say ""work"". I do agree that, you should also study other materials, but change is definitely possible if you ""practice"" these techniques. Definitely work towards you're dreams and learn from you're failures. Setting goals, visualizing and keeping focused on them, along with good old charity, mixed in with a good old dose of positive expectation should yield some pretty surprising results"
5,Supernatural Excellent!!!,"I have read this book twice, but the second time I really studied and digested the material. I am certain your life will be transformed too. When I started the book I felt very helpless and like a prisoner to my circumstances. But then - all of a sudden, I was able to see my way clear because Mr. Boc gave very good insight about what I could do. Read it for yourself. You will see and one your dreams will begin to materialize."
4,Incredible Book with a Horrible Title.,"""How to Solve All Your Money Problems Forever"" by Victor Boc, is a wonderful book with a bad title in my opinion. It shows you how to combine affirmations with ""glad giving"" and experience the incredible results. Using this book, as one of several tools, I have improved my Life considerably. Not only has my income expanded significantly, but I have been able to use these techniques along with journaling, etc... to become more of a whole person. The material objects and money aren't as important anymore, (they don't hurt though.) Now I am experienceing life. Great Book, but the title is off-putting for me as it seems a little less than positive."
3,Good book but unneccesary,"I had this book years ago and donated it because you don't need the book. Here's the content:Tithing: He call's it ""glad-giving"" Donate 5 to 10% of all the money you receive.Written affirmations: Daily writing out how much money you intend to get 25 times in writing.Ex. I now earn $100,000 per year.That is what the entire book is about."
5,Truly Inspiring,"I have started reading this book yesterdayIt is true inspiring; it is in keeping of the Vedanta and Buddhist teachingsIt is the same teachings expounded by Wayne Dyer, Deepak Chopra andLouise Hay in her book ""you can heal your life"""
5,My lab LOVES these!,"My lab loves Sam's Yams! I've been giving them to her for a few years. They don't last as long as a rawhide chew, but these are much more healthy. I break them in two to make the package last a bit longer."
4,Takes some time to switch over from rawhides,As a great treat these are lacking but as a chew substitute they are ok. I am trying to bring my dogs along with us in going veterinarian and these will get them by but they don't love them. I have a younger pit who will eat anything... so far so she's game. But my 8 year old pit is not so happy with the treat situation but will eat these after give the other non meat choices.Update! Well we finished the bag and they both are really warming up to the yams as they haven't had any other chews so I am ordering more bags. So I have revised up from 3 to 4 stars.
5,Very happy puppy,"My dog will not touch regular rawhide or any chewy for that matter, even when it is coated in peanut butter or marinated in steak seasoning. But she's loves these. We wanted her to chew more rawhide to help her teeth and gums. This works!"
1,Dogs threw up,"I was looking forward to receiving this product, as from all reviews, contents, etc., it sounded ideal to keep my large and small dog happily chewing on something healthy.They both chewed, the little one left it. The big one threw up for two days. Since the big one has a cast iron stomach, I can only conclude the product made her sick.Forewarned..."
3,"Healthy treat, expensive!","These were a good treat for our puppy. I don't think I will be purchasing more for a while however because of the price. I really liked knowing they were healthy and good for our dog. She was able to chew them very fast, so for the price, this is not the kind of treat I want to give her. I was hoping they would take her longer to enjoy, but that was wishful thinking."
2,Dogs got sick from eating,I was recommended this product as my two beagles are aggresive chewers and needed something to last more then 15 seconds. After eating them both of my dogs vomited and had diarhhea. They also did not seem to care for the taste to well. I gave them to a friend for his dog (Lab Mix) and it had no problems.
4,Very Fast Shipping,"Fast Shipping. This is the first time I ordered this product, although I have bought sweet potato chews for a long time. These chews are much tougher, thicker, and larger than other brands I use. I have small dogs therefore this was not such a good choice as I had to cut the chews into manageable sizes for my dogs. Not a bad product, just made for larger dogs I would say."
2,1 out of 3,"I bought these thinking they would be good and healthy for my terrier mix and he would enjoy them. I was wrong. After trying for a week, he wanted nothing to do with them. He prefers his Dingo rawhide bones. I gave one to a friend's dog, a lab, who usually eats absolutely anything and everything, but surprisingly, she, too, after a couple of attempts wanted nothing to do with these. Then, I gave one to my sister who has a rat terrier to see if he liked them. At first he didn't, but after a day or so, he now loves them! He must even like the smell of sweet potato because my sister says he even rolls on them! So my experience says 1 out of 3 dogs will enjoy these sweet potato treats."
3,"Dogs LOVE them, eat them way too fast","The dogs love them, and I like that they won't stain carpet or furniture. But it takes my dogs seconds to go through these, so calling them ""chews"" seems a bit of a stretch."
3,Dog treat,My dogs hated it and my friends dog loved it. I wished my 3 dogs liked this product since it's a great natural concept. Too bad for me - try it before you give up on it.
4,My Dog approves,My hound likes these. It took her a couple of tries to discover they were eatable. The first one she chewed and left on the ground but now she seems to have developed a taste for them because she loves it.
5,Labs love it!,"Our Labrador retriever Freya is allergic to most grains. Grain-free dog food is fairly easy to find, but not grain-free treats. Sam's yams are grain-free and she will do anything to have one. I also use them as a way to get her to take a daily dose of apple cider vinegar (to ward off yeast infections). The yams are very dry, but spongy and absorb the vinegar. I put a tablespoon of the vinegar on a treat in the bottom of Freya's food dish. Then I add her dog food to the dish. By the end of every day the treat is gone."
5,Nice to know it is made here in the usa without additives,My tiny Yorkie loves them. For her I cut it small for her little mouth. It is a clean product and gives her something to chew on besides bad stuff like rawhides and bones that wear down the teeth. At least it is nutritional. Don't give your dog too many a day as sweet potato can affect the hormones.
2,Spoiled,"I bought these as an good all natural USA made treat and the date on it was November 2013 for expiration date. When I opened it the sweet potatos had white fuzzy mold on them. Amazon is taking them back and will refund my money. BUT, I also called the company and talked to a really nice lady. She apologized and said if a hole gets into a bag and moisture builds up, they will spoil. I hung up and she called me back. She asked if there was a small white moisture packet in the bag and there wasn't! So, that is what happened and I would try buying from this company again as errors happened. And lets support USA made!"
3,Good...but not much in the bag,My dogs seemed to like them...but there are only 6 chips in a bag. I paid almost $7 dollars and with 4 dogs they're not going to last long. Just not worth it for me. I would recommend if the price want an issue...but I won't be buying them again.
3,"He loves them, but...","My dog LOVES these, but he throws up a few hours after eating them. I thought his system just needed a little time to get used to them, so I kept giving them to him every couple of days. I was so excited about these because they're veggie, but I don't think I'll be buying them again. :o("
1,Maggots in my bag!!!!,I have a three year old lasspoo I have given him sweet potato treats before and he loved them. I have heard and read so many great things about sams yams that when I saw them on amazon I got 4 bags super excited. When I got them I opened them up and gave one to my very excited dog he loved it. But as my doggie is small only 18 lbs I decided to cut them in half so I emptied the treats on my kitchen table to find TWO LIVE MAGGOTS! I was so grossed out I quickly took the treat away from my doggie and opened another bag and the same thing MORE MAGGOTS! I'm so disappointed please do not buy this product! I have pictures !I called the company and left a message since it was after hours I never heard back. Needless to say I returned them to amazon. I wish I could leave a picture on this review to show u all!
3,Glueless,"Why, oh, why did they go so light on the glue? These envelopes looked like an excellent value; perhaps too excellent and I should I suspected something would be missing. That something missing is the self-stick glue. The envelope material itself is fine, but the self-seal function does not work with the little glue they applied. So, every envelope must be sealed with tape. Not what I expected."
3,"Good, but not good enogh","Well, I must say that this book is mixed blessing. On the one hand there are excellent piece about New Orleans, description of smuggling routes, underwater cities and rules section (very helpful). On the other hand there is section about Vladivostok, which I, as Russian, found disappointing."
3,Good book but irritating typos,"I would have given this book atleast 4 stars if it weren't for the misleading typos! here's a few - Chapter 6 Pg 127 refers to Figure 6.2 (which doesn't exist!) instead of Figure 6.3; Chatper 10 Pg 228 the example ""H1 {color: #ff000 }"" is plain wrong (needs a extra zero at the end) and will not work.Otherwise, it is a very good book. I especially like Chapter 4 - describes CSS selectors in great detail."
2,Not the best choice,"There are many books to learn CSS, but this is not your best option. This is a dry read. And it's exclusive use of css embedded in HTML pages defies the purpose of CSS, which is to create a uniform look across a collection of pages. Embedded in the HTML, CSS becomes merely an upgrade to HTML."
4,Sturdy. adhesive is so-so,"Good sturdy envelope. Perhaps I got an out of date batch, but the adhesive performance is just marginal -I usually back it up with a strip of packaging tape."
3,Nice and heavy duty,"I do alot of shipping on ebay and these envelopes are ideal for shipping small items over seas. Only down side is that they are not self adhesive. I give them an ""A""."
2,"not 6"" x 9""","These envelopes are not close to being 6"" by 9"". I measured them and they are 4 1/2"" x 6 1/2"". I specifically wanted 6"" by 9"" because I had some of the 4 1/2"" by 6 1/2"" envelopes and it was a tight fit. Quality is decent but shouldn't be advertised as 6 x 9."
3,"Maybe a big disappointment, maybe not...","Before I decided to buy this CD, I read carefully recommandations and reviews by other people through the net and though so, if to buy or not. Because I own all Adiemus CD released before, this led me to buy the CD.Well, Jenkins' work is still good. Maybe hard to understand in some moments, but... professional.The Finish singers did a good work too, with a bit of extravaganza, as typical for them...For those who don't know and expect a review of well-done of Miriam Stockley, this is the disappointment to come - Miriam, the voice of Adiemus, because of her solo career growing, refused to co-operate with this project and as she sung song entitled ""EMPTY SPACE"" on her self-titled solo album, she left the same empty space here, in Adiemus..."
2,Very cheap & flimsy. I sent them back.,Not happy with purchase. Does not look like the picture. Very poorly made.
4,Good for platform bed,These are the only under bed sweater containers I could find that fit under my low platform bed. My only complaint is that I wish they were bigger.
2,Don't buy,"This item matchs neither the dimension (not 16-16-4, but 16-13-4) nor the color(not white but dirty cream). Also it is not hard sided as shown on the picture, the sides are made of thin cloth. I would buy it for 1.99$. You get hard sided, bigger boxes for much less price."
3,Good idea - one bad flaw,This is a great way to keep a wall-mounted TV screen as close to the wall as possible. The only problem I encountered is it sits in between two studs in the wall and the center of the mount (VM 400) is offset from the center of the box by over 4 inches. There is absolutely no adjustment from left to right to center the TV on a wall without relocating studs. So buyer beware if left to right positioning is critical.
3,Great sweatshirt but sizing was very small,"This is a great sweatshirt. however, I ordered a XL womens and it was WAY to small. My 8 yr old daughter wore it this season. She LOVES IT!!! GO NYG!!"
4,Interesting read,"This is a very interesting compilation of children's ""memories"" of what seem to be past lives. Those who are interested in the idea of reincarnation will find this anecdotal evidence intriguing. Of course, there can be no scientific proof of reincarnation, at least not yet, but since I myself have had vivid dreams of incidents that suggested past lives, I am open-minded about these kinds of reports. The stories are sincere and well-written, and I enjoyed them very much."
3,historical value,"i enjoy reincanation books , so this one fancinated me. i enjoyed most of the stories but was a little disappointed that there was no varification or more reseach into these stories.over all a intersting book"
4,Replacement parts,The little locking tabs on these covers can be brittle after a couple of years use. Both of my Fluval 404 impellar covers had cracked. I plan on trying to keep the edge of these new covers lubricated with silicone grease so that I don't have to pull on the tabs as hard to remove these covers.
3,entertainer,"sound O.K. need more base. don't buy if you don't have sub woofer. at $200 a pair is fair to buy, $300 is little too much. You can get better pair at this price."
5,Bose 191 speakers,These speakers are very easy to install and sound great. These speakers are much better than other in-wall speakers because the enclosure keeps the sound from emanating through the walls to other rooms in the house. They are great for the Home Theater as well as listening to music.
2,Not that good,A so-so tale with a too weird cowboy star written in that very old-fashion style and language. I love westerns but this one was way too corny for me.
1,Caveat Emptor,"The previous reviewer (GL Wilson) is definitely onto something. I don't know if these tracks were produced by any member of the authentic Slave lineup (who may have legal license to the name), but these tracks are definitely remakes, not reissues of the orginals. What a disappointment!!! I am at a loss as to understand this tactic. I confess that I bought this CD, but second-hand and deeply discounted (thanks to the heads up review from Wilson), simply out of curiousity. If I were Ralph Nader, I would attest that this CD is unsuitable at ANY price!!!! Finally A PERSONAL NOTE...I am making a direct petition to whomever holds the rights to the album ""Just a Touch of Love"" that they PLEASE give SERIOUS consideration to releasing it sometime sooner than later. I, like many others, am a huge Slave fan, and it is an insult to us all that these rehashes be trotted out to tantalize those who are true followers of the group. THANK YOU!!!!!"
1,2 Frisbee's,"I have to agree with G.L. Wilson, and TMack. I bought the cd because being the die-hard Slave fan that I am, I had to have it in my collection. However, after painfully listening to both cd's, actually giving most tracks the 10-second quick listen, I must say I was totally disappointed. These are 2 cd's that you can use as Frisbee's.Whereas Drac, Mark Adams, Floyd Miller, and Danny Webster are on these cd's, this isn't the Slave I'm accustomed to hearing.Warning - ""Don't waste your $$$"""
2,Meandering with ridiculous artwork,"I love Barry Greenstein, but in a rush to fill the need in the marketplace this book was hastily published at the height of the new poker craze. (I don't actually know this, but this is how it seems to me.)Apparently Greenstein was invited to write a single chapter in someone else's book. He did a lot of writing and felt that it was enough for a book. However it would have been a small book (though perhaps a good one.) However the publishers seem to have wanted better sales by fattening it up and adding lots of stock photography of gambling and casino images. These images often have little to no relationship with the editorial content on opposing pages.Barry, you can do better than this. You have a good book inside of you, but this isn't it."
3,More biography than poker advice,"This is a good book, but it's a long way from being an in depth poker strategy text. Harrington's books are much better for poker strategy. This book is equally Barry biography and Barry's poker tips. It's well written and interesting, but it's not a 5 star strategy book."
3,Great coffee table book.,"I would have given it 2 1/2 stars, because 2 stars means you don't like the book. Great pictures and a smattering of just enough in the way of poker to possibly get you interested in learning more. Like I said, it's a great coffee table book to start the conversation going about poker."
4,Introspection into a poker pro...,"Let me start of by saying that this is not your typical poker book. If you are looking to solely improve your game, look elsewhere.. like Brunson's Super System or Slansky's Theory of Poker. This is his life story and how Barry came about becoming a poker pro. There arent too many books that offer this kind of social aspect of the poker world. After reading this book, I feel like I know Barry inside out, why he is such a respected character in the poker world today. He also does offer some nice advice how to prosper in the poker world. If you are considering becoming a full time poker pro... THIS IS A MUST READ!"
3,Title is very misleading....but still an interesting read,"This is NOT an advanced poker guide. I enjoyed the book and would have given it four stars if not for the misleading title. Don't buy this book if you are looking to learn about poker strategy or about actually playing poker.What this book does do is give you a real look at what life as a professional gambler is like, and it gives some good advice regarding that profession. And it has some interesting and entertaining anecdotes. It should be titled an advanced guide to the life of professional gambling.I bought it because I respect Barry's game and also him as a person. But I was disappointed because I was expecting more on actual poker strategy."
3,Not much discussion on strategy,"When I purchased this book, I had the highest expectations to improve my game because I am very fond of Greenstein's style as a poker player. Unfortunately, his book doesn't live up to my high hopes. Greenstein mentions that this book originally started out as 1 chapter for Super System 2. Well, I believe him. There is very little here on what I'd consider ""advanced poker"". He does go into some detail covering a couple hold'em hands in big tourneys, but the rest is filler. Each ""chapter"" contains about 4 pages with lots of glossy photos to fill in the pages. Overall, this book could be best used for some general poker info , but to call it ""advanced"" is a bit absurd."
3,"Insightful book, though not very ""advanced""","Barry Greenstein has many interesting perspectives on the game of poker, from his experiences in tournaments and cash games to things like getting enough rest before playing and even to the advisability of having a sex partner on the side during poker excursions!When Mr. Greenstein gets to the mathematical aspects of poker (pot odds, etc.), it takes up less than 10% of the book. So for the book to be call ""advanced"" is a bit of a stretch.But overall, you may find the book a good read if you have a general interest in poker."
2,All fluff - no stuff.,"This would best be described as an ""Overview of the Poker World"", but certainly not ""An Advanced Poker Guide"" as stated on the cover. This is a high quality paper back with page after page of glossy photos and brief simple chapters, a great beginners guide.There's nothing new here. If you have the basic game down and are looking for ""poker wisdom from a seasoned pro"", you'll be very disappointed. A far better investment would be Dan Harrington's recent works (volumes I & II)"
3,Needs for info,"While Greenstein is a great pro and humanitarian, his book offers only a modicum of practical advice for advanced play in no limit tournaments. It is primarily a large coffee table book with some nice photos.Alan Safani"
5,best poker books ever !!!,it actually write all bout the philosophy about poker and it teaches u to be a better poker players before or after u win the game !!!!
2,Fluff on the River,"There is some good stuff in this book for starters. BUT, 3/4th of the book could have been done away with. If you added all the pages of pictures up consecutively, it would be about half the book. Fluff. An itemized list is found that describes how insensitive poker players can be. More Fluff. Greenstein himself said that when writing the section for Brunson's Super System 2, it became too long at 100 pages. Well, thats fine...but to turn 100 pages into a marketable book, he added a bunch of pretty pictures, full page spreads of casinos, large font...etc.Half of the books feels like it's aimed towards someone who has never walked into a casino or picked up deck of cards.The meat of it may be worth it, of course, even if you gain just one thing. I was really looking forward to it and am, overall, disappointed. An Advanced Poker Guide? Seriously?"
3,Not what I was looking for,I found the pictures nice but lacking in substance pertaining to NLH. 2/3 of the book was about Barry's biography.
3,Beautiful looking book,This is a gorgeous book - perfect for the coffee table. But ifyou want books that help you to win at poker - look elsewhere. Itis just ok in that area. The book is interesting - just don'texpect to learn as much about poker theory as you would fromHarrington or Sklansky books.
5,Insightful and articualate,"I can't believe the reviews that pan this wonderful book. Barry gives us some hands to ponder the math and much much more. In addition on his website he includeds some information that was cut from the Book. I advise anyone who is seriously considering the life of a poker professional to read and take heed to this book. I found the book very informative about the world inside the ring. I think its a must read for anyone who has advanced beyond the level of maniac. There is no magic system, no holy grail and no greatest poker player. On any given day you could be the greatest player or a donk. Experienced players know the pot odds and the theory. This book provides good info and great advice."
1,A complete waste of time and money.....,"This book is proof of all the ""poker pros"" out there trying to cash in on their experience by writing books. If you are a real player, stick with Sklansky, Harrington, and SuperSystem. 1/2 of this book is filled with glossy photos, and most of the remainder is a very superficial discussion of sports gambling, compulsive gambling, and general gambling trivia. There are only about 10 pages of sample hands that are at all relevant to an intermediate or advanced player. Save your money."
1,Very dissatisfied,"If I wanted to know all about his life, I would have preferred he advertise it as a biography, not a poker help book!"
4,Ace on the River,"Recommended by Pros. Very good. Not the same 'ol, some 'ol. Offer new insites and points of view. You should read others first, but this is a great follow up."
1,No wonder Doyle asked Barry to write this book,"Barry was supposed to write a chapter in Dolye's Super/System, but when Doyle saw his work he asked him to turn it into a book instead because the material was ""too good"". I think that Doyle asked Barry to turn this into a book because he didn't want his Super/System book to be complete flop!I have read more than a dozen books on poker, strategy, life of poker players, stories, etc, and this is by far the worst book ever! He filled it with nice pictures so it can be a conversation piece. If you have any interest in poker, buy any other book - even one from Phil Hellmuth.The best chapter in the book is the one about sex and poker. It is very funny because it is so dumb. Pimps have higher morales than this guy, and most can likely write better than him!"
2,Ace on the River: An Advanced Poker Guide,Interesting story. Good for advanced players as far as fine points are concerned. Not a lot of beginning player systems. Both novices and veterans can benefit from advice on ethics.
4,Nice book for your coffetable,"First off I want to say I really enjoyed the book. If you want a book that is pretty and well made this is for you. Most of it was enjoyable but the reason I buy poker books is to learn something. Really don't think my play improved from reading this but I am not sorry I bought it.If you want a book for the nightstand this is your baby. If you want to learn something, save your money."
3,Not so advanced,"While this was an easy book to read, I did not find it to be that advanced. It had a couple of good chapters on the mental challenges of poker but basically it consisted of a lot of nice pictures and funny anecdotes. I expected more practical examples and better statistical information given the author's reputation in the area."
2,Poker Photo Book,"This isn't the book I thought it would be. It's much more about poker society then it is an instructional poker book. It has very short essay type chapters on such topics as how gambling is viewed in America, brain chemistry, sexuality of a poker player,psychology of gambling, etc. This is all well and good because it's billed as a different kind of poker book. My main gripe with the book is all the filler. Half the book is photos. They're big and glossy and nice but I didn't think I was buying a poker coffee table photo book."
5,easy read,"Interestingly enough after reading this book I did not win any of the poker tournaments I played in. Which is sad really, with the high expectation of implementing all of my new tools for no limit poker. But that really was not what the book was meant to do and I am glad because that is what every other poker book I read was trying to do. What Greenstein does and what makes this book so powerful is that he gives a solid foundation for a serious poker player to follow not just at the tables but also with the social scene, family life, and financial side of playing the game.If you are looking for a get rich quick guide to no limit hold em, you should go read Helmuths book (chances are you will go broke you Jackal). If you want a guide into the world of poker that will explain how to handle almost every aspect of the game then Barry is your man.Oh and the pictures are cool too!"
2,The AK of Poker Books,"It looks pretty, and has shiny pictures, but if you want to learn something new about no limit holdem, this is not the book for you. This book is filled with Barry's opinion on appropriate ettiquette at a game, money management (nothing specific, just him saying don't blow it - seriously) and is basically his autobiography. I play online professionally for a living (small stakes) but am developing into a pro. I would recommend The Theory of Poker - David Sklansky. Tournament Poker for Advanced Players - David Sklansky. And of course Super System - 1 or 2 is the same for the NL Holdem section. I mean no book is going to turn you into a pro, it takes a combination of things, and alot alot of play. This book will not make you a better poker player, simple as that."
4,For the advanced player...,"The title suggests it all. A beginning player will not grasp the concepts in this book to its fullest. However, the book describes the high level psychology and management that will attract any level of reader.If you want a technical manuscript, you may want to hold off until the 2nd version comes out which will include more hand examples."
2,Not your typical poker book,"This book was the most anticipated poker book since SuperSystem by Brunson. It's a bit of a letdown if you're looking for a how-to-play-poker book. It's filled with advice on how to lead one's life as a poker player. Honestly, if you need to read a poker book to know how to stay out of trouble, then you're in a lot more trouble than a poker book can help you with. The second half of the book is devoted to strategy but they're not mind-blowing. Basically, the book is well-produced with nice color photos and good quality paper, but it isn't going to help you improve your game. It does help you keep poker and life in perspective, which is important, so buy it and add it to your collection. One more poker book can't hurt you, and if you win even $30 as a result of reading the book, then you've already got your money's worth."
3,Book Comes Up Short,"In my opnion this book comes up short in every aspect it covers. All the chapters contain interesting topics but never go into enough depth. I also found some of the instructional hands odd as teaching examples. If you would like a brief overview of what the professional poker world is like and want to see a bunch of pictures of other poker pros, this is the book for you."
3,Doesnt go into poker stratagy untill teh end,"At the closing of the text it does provide some very good information in terms of how to play hands and also the thought process he had in hands as well as some level 2/3 thinking of poker. Up untill teh end it doesnt really have to much usefull information. It talks about BR management, sex & poker, being honest, and various other things which do not really discuss poker strategy. It does have some intresting information before the hands which he discusses, but its not really so much a guide in poker. Super system by brunson, The little green book by phil gordon, and the harrington books are all far better. Im giving this book 3 starts instead of 2 b/c it does have some very nice pictues in it, and if photograpgy is your thing youm ight want to grab it. Also as I said the poker statagy at teh end is good. I think its reletivly obvious why I'm not giving it 4. If anything I'd give it 2.5 stars"
3,Barry needs to keep his night job,"It's a cool book, a bathroom reader really. I think the subtitle was ""an advanced poker guide."" That is stretching it some!The book is short but has about 9000 chapters... one or two pages of random thoughts qualifies as a chapter.I am a photographer... and the photos in here are awesome. The book is all color, thick glossy pages... it is an odd shape, very big.If you want a book to learn hold'em, TJ's pot limit is hard to beat, try Dan Harrington for advanced play. Barry discusses his life, philosophy, and some odd characters in the game.It's definitely worth the price, but expect entertainment more than instruction."
1,Most useless book on Poker I've ever read,"I've read more than twenty books on Poker. I also like Barry very much. But there is not really much of content in this book. It's a huj-puj of disconnected, unorganized thoughts. I am surprized that so many people have given it 3-5 stars ranking. The thoughts in the book are incoherent. There is no logical progression in the content. I've tried to read it a few times at different times, but every time I get more disappointed than before. What a waste of ink and paper!"
5,Radical Ecofeminism Rocks!,"what will happen to our specie if the destruction of our planet continues? can the earth be saved? how? this remarkable book links ecology and patriarchy to explore issues of violence and power and human's attempt to save the specie and the planet; but it goes further than that, much further - in a patriarchal world it is near impossible to imagine what women's culture would look like; this book visualizes a world that is breathtakingly original and inspiring; a must read for women and environmentalists alike, men will also benefit from its feminist perspective on our fragile planet blue"
2,Could Do Better,"I must say being a fan of Gerald Levert this CD leaves a great deal to be desired. He isn't being true to himself or his fans. Gerald as a voice that women crave and he is doing way too many up tempo songs. No, I don't want to pigeon hole a brother, but stay with what comes natural and too many of the songs on this CD sound forced."
3,Good service,"the cd was used, it had a couple small scratches, but it plays very good. the case was cracked badly. I got very good service. I would use again.I got cd in good time also."
3,"Not very ""Genius"" of Gerald","Gerald Levert - A Stroke of Genius (Elektra, 2003)Being a big fan of Gerald Levert (who appears to have lost some weight, look at the album cover!), I ran out to get this album. However, I'm a little disappointed. It seems like Gerald's trying to get out of his contract with Elektra Records so that's why he's rushing out one album per year. It also seems that after 15-plus years in the music biz, singer/songwriter Gerald is running out of things to say and clever ways to say them. He does, however, join forces with writer Edwin ""Tony"" Nicolas again and they produce some great songs like ""U Got That Love"", ""Rest of Your Life"", and ""Close to You"" with Tamia. The best song from him in a long time has to be ""Awesome"": the song truly lives up to its title. Still, there aren't enough moments like this to make this album a must-buy and the fact that this album is 17 tracks long with 3 interludes makes that point even more upsetting. -EJR"
3,Not his best work,"On this particular CD there was only one song that triggered my interest the first time I heard the CD. That song was ""U Got That Love."" I have a theory that if I buy a cd and I listen to it and I like a song or songs the first time I ever hear it, then its a good song, but in this case there was only one song that I really liked on the whole cd."
5,Great,On time recieved before expected date. The packageing was superior. I will order again. I am very happy with there service and would recommend anyone to use there service.
5,LOVE THIS CD,There was a certain song by Gerald Levert that I wanted and did not know the name of it. I found it on Amazon and was able to listen to a little of it to make sure it was the one I was looking for. I am happy that I did. The CD was in great condition and plays great. Thank you
2,Stroke of Genius is just OK,"Let me start off saying that Gerald Levert is a good singer. I've heard him absolutely ""tear up"" soul classics such as his electrifying performance at Aretha Franklin's Walk of Fame on BET. He has ""pipes"" so to speak. This album really left me hanging. I expected to hear those great pipes being really used, but this album just didn't do it for me. His top songs are ""Awesome"" which I would give 5 stars because it is brilliant & his duet with Tamia (""(They Long To Be) Close To You"") which is great. I even liked ""Knock Knock Knock"", though I thought it lacked something and seemed a bit on the corny side. "" Stroke of Genius"" is ok, merely average. The rest of the album just doesn't work for me and doesn't live up to its title ""STROKE OF GENIUS"". Gerald is a great vocalist, but his album is mediocre at most. 2 1/2 stars."
2,Not as good as G-Spot,"He's trying to keep up with the younger crowd, but needs to just be himself. G-Spot was better even thought it was not a bedroom/""G-spot"" CD. The titles of these two albums should be switched."
1,What is this?,"Does anyone even know what this cd is, or where it came from? what songs are on it? if anyone know's what this is write a review and tell me please"
2,You Morons,"it doesnt say anywhere on the description that this is the new album, or an album at all. it says ""Import"" its just some cheap thing with blink songs on it titled ""use your erection 1&2"" it never said anything about being a new album, so if thats what you expect or think it said, you screwed up."
5,What The Heck Is This?,"Has anyone actually received a copy of this yet? All I've heard is a bunch of people complain about how freakin' slow amazon is on getting it shipped. I've ordered it and it should be in tomorrow. We'll see. And now that guy from Blink is saying it's not official but i heard about it on there official site. If this is just some prank or crap I'm gonna be pissed off at amazon. If anyone at amazon could e-mail me about this tha'd be great. If anyone else has recieved this album yet I.M. me at ""micky8633"" or e-mail me at ""blinkster_1@msn.com"". Ends."
2,Where is Mary?,"This book seems like it teaches good, but, hardly any of the songs are songs you would recognize.Child lost interest very quickly (about 5 minutes), and switched to another book with popular nursery rymmes like Mary had a little lamb, etc."
5,Brill,Anything from this man is a hit. I would watch this many times. Never get bored. Any more Sinatra Memorials
5,Three,"The feel of this music is a little different than the previous two CD's, but this one is the best yet! ""We Always Knew"" is charismatic."
4,Classic harmony trio roots reggae.,"With Come Straight, Ronnie Davis & Idren turn out a wonderful, under-recognized album. Ronnie Davis was for many years a harmony vocalist with the Itals though he had a lot of solo albums in Jamaica in the 1970s and before that was a member of the seminal group The Tennors. On Come Straight, he offers conscious lyrics and a one-of-a-kind voice--clear, piercing and sweet. The songs will please listeners of the Itals as well as any fan of the tradition of harmony trios in Jamaican music. It's a throwback album in many ways, and given the fact that so much in today's dancehall reggae music is computer processed and growled and shouted out, the sheer attention to the art of vocalizing makes this a welcome album."
5,"Ye Who Will Bless the Poor, Shall Yourselves Find Blessing","An excellent children's book of one of the greatest carols ever. This carol above all proclaims the social justice of the Gospel; the need to share what we have with others, even in the face of our own adversity, and at the loss of our own pleasure. It's only the more wonderful in that it's based on the story of an actual king, Wenceslas, the patron saint of the Czech Republic, who worked tirelessly for his five years in office to bring Christianity to his country of Bohemia. With very beautiful illustrations with a Gothic style of writing, the entire carol is included, a verse for each illustration, along with the notes at the end to sing along with. Children of about 30 should enjoy this work as well."
3,Good King Wenceslas,"The art work is beautiful, but I expected it to be a story - not just the words to the Christmas carol."
2,not what I expected,"This book is a photocopy of original manuscripts. Interesting, but expected a book I could read to the kids with cool illustrations."
5,Rock--A-Billy Review,"As with all the discs in this series the liner notes are great and the song selection is excellent. A must for any rock-a-billy music fan.The Mean Eyed CatRock-A-Billy ReviewKNON Radio 89.3Dallas, Texas"
4,"useful! no pretense, great photos!","I haven't gotten past the midway point in this book, that's how rich and useful the first half is. When it comes to decor books, I tend to look at all the pictures first, then backtrack to read ... That approach works well with this book too and I suggest you try it too. Boy, the photo captions reveal MUCH more than meets the eye! Bigtime!!! What I saw the first go-round was tons of exquisite color photos of living rooms, bedrooms, bathrooms, entryways, the works... On the second go-round, the rooms' beauty secrets were revealed in the tell-all photo captions.Great no-pretense book that will captivate some readers. The rooms are lovely and splendid yet down to Earth. Minor note: It's written in British English ...British slang has been absent so far (thank heavens) ... It was probably edited out (double thank heavens) ... The cover image is blah but the rest of the book is dynamite."
1,King of Schlock,"On his website, Morse describes in bizarre and rambling language his struggles with legal and family problems stemming from his first marriage and how he was told by an imaginary falcon to move ""quickly in the dark of night"" to the East Coast, where his destiny lay and where he could find rich soil for his ""BIG IDEA"" to grow.Morse does not directly describe his ""BIG IDEA"" but says it took him years to think about and write down, that it came from children, and that ""it made a lot of people cry.""""People from all over the world asked him to come and talk to them about his BIG IDEA,"" he wrote, often using the third person. ""He noticed that most of these people had a child who had died."" -CBS"
5,Heavy Days is a classic!,"this is one of the greatest modern jazz cd's ever recorded. a true unsung classic. the music rolls along and barrells almost out of control, but never missing a beat and never going so far off course that it derails the focus of the tune. Heavy Days... could almost be described as free jazz, but with a strong hard bop lean. there are some more avany garde tunes toward the end of the album, but it's nothing too ""far out"" that would alienate most casual jazz listeners. Cuypers on the piano is a madman..he conducts this group with a fiery passion that just doesn't seem to let up. i've heard the title track being compared to the theme song to Peanuts show, and it makes sense. but in a wild rollercoaster sort of way. you are advised to pick up this brilliant piece of jazz and experience it for yourself. Atavistic never seems to fail to deliver the goods on their Unheard Music Series. certainly music that should be heard again and again."
2,A little too close to Lifetime sludge,"This is something for ladies only. About a rich woman played by Jane Seymour who's husband is conducting a phone sex ritual by an adult escort woman, and then the husband suddenly vanishes, and the wife wants to know what's going on? Everyone is suspect even the private eye that's hired( the first time Parker Stevenson was on film in 7 years, and 6 months after the divorce from Kirtstie Alley.). It's lukewarm suspense at best, but this is for a rainy day at home movie only. I just felt it kept my interest for one time only, and now it's over."
1,disjointed,"Athough it is a good mystery, We never know why her husband goes to a 900 sex line for sex, except that janes character is the wife with the money.. she sleeps with the almost hero, I did not care for his acting. neither in other movies he has appeared in.. the Jane character is the heroine and saves her own life... why she sleeps with the out of work detective .... with her contacts and intellect to solve the mystery is unknown and another exploitation of Jane Seymour."
1,NOTHING BUT A GISMO!,"I was skeptical about this working. And it doesn't. My husband set it up outside and it was ""TURNED ON"" for weeks. He was watering the yard one evening and out of curiosity, he flooded one of the old mole wholes. Guess what popped up? A MOLE! And it was only about 5 feet away from the mole chaser gismo. That's all it is ""A GISMO!"" I guess it threw off the mole's senses though. I guess that's all it's good for, because my husband was able kill 3 w/no problem!"
3,"So far, so good...","I have had some success with this product. In the 3 weeks that I have had it in my garden I have seen one vole hole vacated. The only negative comment I have about the product is that they are somewhat delicate. You must make sure that you predrill a hole because you may break the unit trying to put it in the ground. Once the plastic seal is cracked, rain gets in and it will stop working."
1,Very poor text book.,"This book is quite simply awful. The author is verbose, especially toward the end of the book. In the last third of the book she seems more interested in impressing the reader with her ability to make simple concepts seem staggeringly complex, than to actually break them down.Do yourself a favor and research the author. She often interjects her religious beliefs and political opinions into the material. This is not surprising as Jessica M. Utts is a allegedly an expert in the pseudoscience of parapsychology. As I said, run a Google search on her and you will find all you need to know.If you are seeking a textbook for your community college or university, please look elsewhere. Your students deserve better."
2,P-Value?,"Mostly, I'm irritated by the lack of focus on practical, step by step approaches to calculations. The lack of clarity on definitions needs improvement too. I'm pissed at my teacher for picking this book!"
2,Disappointed,"This book also comes with a cd which I did not receive. I contacted the seller and was told this information was given. I suppose I might have missed it, but I believe it wasn't stressed enough. This is a textbook, and the contents of the cd was required throughout the text. So I am not sure how helpful it is to see a textbook without the accompanying cd. I believe the missing cd information should have been more prominent! It's been a challenge getting through my course without the cd. I will not purchase from this seller again."
2,-_- Misunderstanding,"I must apologize for my last review, I was upset and a little confused. This is a sound form. It is as I described above, but be it known this is a SOUND FORM. Do not buy this product expecting a soundtrack ^_^. Sorry if my last review was a little aggressive..."
3,Unbelievable!,"Being a long time fan of Donna Fletcher's books, I was utterly amazed at the absurdity of the story of this book! Good characters for sure, but you'd have to read it to believe it, and it made me think it's time to look into some male authors."
3,dark warrior,"This book just drags on and on and is an extremely tedious read. I stopped reading it half way through because I became frustrated with the same repetitive non-sense. I really do not recommend this read, I really regret spending the amount of money I spent on this book; can I get my money back?"
4,The Betrayal,"This is part two of a trilogy called Mystical Highlands. All three books are about three sisters in medievel Scotland who live in a mystical kingdom and are witches~healers~seers. They are called upon by three brave and gorgeous highland lairds. The first book, Highland Sword, is IMO, so far the best. This one is very good though it lags a little at first. I'm still reading the third.If you like medievel Scotland, lairds, but also mythal creatures like winged horses, trolls, witches...etc..then I recommend this book."
1,Engine Repair A-1,"Do not buy this cd, its not a dvd as advertised and it dont run for 400 mins it 20 min long and it skips a lot of the topics that you need to pass the ASE test, you have been WARNED!!!!!"
4,Linen towel,"We purchased these to serve more as a placemat. I love the colors and patterns. After washing, however, I didn't love so much how wrinkled they were. I'm not big into ironing....but perhaps for these, I may have to pull it out. I should have known better the ""wrinkle-factor"" with linen.Great product otherwise!"
1,False Advertising!!!!,"What is pictured is not what you get, but like others have said, just not worth sending back. This is a total rip-off."
1,product not as pictured,The product received was nothing like the product pictured. It was not worth shipping back a $3 product. Buyer beware
1,totally misleading book title,"I agree with other buyers. I was looking for a book that had pictures of wine labels (the paper label on the bottle). Instead this is a book on what I would consider wine medallions. It is also mostly history and not many pictures, and the pictures there are are in black and white, not color like the cover suggests. This was a gift for my husband and we are both completely disappointed with the book (and the sellers return policy)."
5,extraordinary,"Triangle may be the best novel I've ever read. Weber writes with astonishing eloquence and great wit. This is a novel that you will want to read quickly, to find out what's going to happen, and slowly, because you will not want it to end."
2,Had to force myself to finish,"I enjoy reading novels based on historical facts and I remember learning about the Triangle Fire in school so this book caught my attention. It's interesting to read the sections about the fire, but I don't feel the author came through providing an interesting story or characters to wrap it in. I found it to be very dull for the most part. It was confusing in spots, predictable in others. Almost a regurgitation of other works (relative survived a tragic event in history and has a secret). In a nutshell, I do not recommend this book."
4,wow,learned so much from this book and loved the complexities of the characters. Told in an interesting way with the retelling of the story so many times.Wish the music part was limited more. I wanted so much to read the story/plot that I tended to skim over those parts.
2,"Too much music, not enough story",This book is interesting in concept but very thinly written. I enjoyed learning a bit about the Triangle Fire but thought the musical interludes were distracting. Each time I felt as thought the book was finally getting more in depth the author switches to a part about music and frankly I felt like instead of adding to the story it took away. The ending can be seen a mile out and is so trite it made me laugh. Not nearly as good as it could have been.
2,"Read The Music Lesson, instead.","This is a quick read. It contains an interesting discussion about memory and truth. The chapters which dealt with the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory were interesting, although parts were repetitive. The chapters which dealt with the boyfriend's musical composition were a bit over my head, actually contained too much detail for me. I preferred The Music Lesson to this book."
3,Not what I expected,I was hoping for more story about the Triangle fire. There seemed to be a lot of loose ends. I was disappointed.
3,Muddled Story Falls Short,"On March 25, 2011, the 100th anniversary of the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire will be observed. It was the 9/11 of its time and ignited reforms in working conditions and union representation. While this book is lyrically written, it has a number of discordant notes. At times it reads almost like two small books pasted together: one dealing with fire survivor Esther Gottesfeld's experiences and the other of her granddaughter Rebecca and her future husband composer George Botkin. What left me cold was the portrayal of a researcher, Ruth Zion, as a repelling, cartoonish, self-absorbed woman. As she attempts to find out whether there were children in the building on the day of the fire, Rebecca and George fight her at every step. The story creates tension between an individual's right to privacy and the value of full revelation of the facts about a major tragedy. Weber's plot suggests she believes that some facts are better hidden than revealed."
3,A novella in search of a novel,"This is a frustrating book. Parts of it were moving, other parts irritating. The storyline about the Triangle Shirtwaist Fire of 1911 was riveting; the mysterious story and character of Esther who survived the fire are engaging, real, and quite poignant. But the contemporary characters and most of those long tangents on music bugged to the point of madness.Frankly, I think Ms. Weber had enough story for a novella and tried to stretch it to book length with all this other ""arty"" stuff. Yeah, yeah, it was supposed to be some kind of cockamamie metaphor--I get that. It just didn't work for me and came off as pretentious claptrap, especially in contrast to Esther's powerful story. That has stayed with me. So...this is an excellent novella, but not such a great novel."
1,Disappointed is this author/story,"In the hands of a more competent writer, I think this story would have been better. I finally had to skip some pages regarding George's musical abilities. I don't like to do that, but it became very annoying after a while. I felt that the endless descriptions of the day of the fire were not necessary. Writers no longer get paid ""by the word"", so I think we could have done without so much repitition. Their treatment of Ruth Zion was rude and not very convincing. Most people would want to know what she had uncovered through her research. I thought the death scene was lovely, but grandma was rude and annoying and I didn't miss her. I'm starting to repeat myself, too. There are some people who enjoyed this book. I'm just not one of them."
3,disappointed,"There were parts of this novel I enjoyed, but found the story line fractured and difficult to follow. All the right elements were there, but they never came together. What could have been a great historical novel about a tragedy that changed the working conditions of our country turned out to be so much less than what it could have been."
3,"If you missed it the first two times, let me repeat....","A young woman's quite elderly grandmother is the last survivor of the infamous ""Triangle"" shirtwaist factory fire in 1911, and as she enters her final illness, the granddaughter and a journalist both get involved in the past and the grandmother's shifting accounts of what happened on the tragic day she lost her sister and fiancé in the fire. The granddaughter and her composer boyfriend defend and protect the grandmother while the nosy journalist worms her way into their lives and starts poking holes in discrepancies she has found in transcripts and former testimony. Except for the pages (too many) devoted to Grandma Esther's retelling the same story, with only subtle changes one might catch, this is a good read. Characters are well drawn and the mystery of what Esther really went through is gradually and satisfyingly revealed (albeit not surprising by the time it's told)."
2,HUH???,"This book drove me and several of my friends crazy. Was Esther Pauline? Why did she cooperate at the trial? So many unanswered questions, so much left hanging. Is that necessary? Most of us just decided to just forget the whole thing and end the discussions. We simply were too confused and frustrated."
2,Triangle by Katharine Weber,"I was very disappointed in this book. The character of George Botkin, the musician, was tedious and dull. I found this book to be boring and was not able to get beyond the first couple of chapters."
2,a bit too far over the edge,"this is by far my least favorite astro-album. MOAM started a gradual transition away from ""space surf rock"" toward more offbeat and noisy music with the ""technetium"" album, and may have gone a bit too far this time. ""Technetium"" is an amazing album, ""EEVIAC"" is good, but this one just goes too far into the ""strange noises"" for my tastes. i mean, really, there's a track that's nothing but the buzzing of a dot-matrix printer! there are very few tracks on this album that seem to be more than ""organized noise"".but hey, they're free to experiment, and i'll be buying their next effort the day it comes out. but as it stands, I can't recommend this particular album even to seasoned MOAM fans, much less people looking for an introduction to the band. (for that, you need ""Project Infinity"" or ""Experiment Zero"")"
4,A solid rock record from the new MOAM,"With the loss of fantastic guitarist Brian Causey, Man Or Astroman was faced with a great challenge to keep up the quality recording output they've issued over the years. The first effort by the new band, EEVIAC, wasn't a very solid release, but this new record is a very satisying rock record, just enough like the old Man Or Astroman to make it fair to use the name, but more powerful and less surfy. The recording quality exceeds other recent MOAM records like Made From Technetium & EEVIAC, as they've once again teamed up with Steve Albini, who put to tape MOAM's finest work, Experiment Zero. I highly recommend Spectrum Of Infinite Scale."
2,Terrible,"I can't believe that anyone thinks that this is a good rock record. When you a guitar driven band - you must have good riffs and good writing to make it work, and that's where this album falls flat. All of the songs are basic, boring power chord stuff that goes nowhere. It sucks. Sorry. Add to that the annoying electronic effects and general musical [madness] and this is a empty shell of an album. The only saving grace is the awesome drumming - it sounds like Birdstuff made his own record while the rest of the band goofed off while the tape rolled. Man or Astroman needs to break up, they have yet to make a good record without Starcrunch. If you want a good surf album - try the Ghastly Ones, Satan's Pilgrims or Slacktone. Or an old MOAM album, back when they had direction."
3,Cheaply made...get something made in Germany!,Very cheaply made and the holes were HUGE so I imagine it would catch a pigeon from coming into the cabin not nothing microbial.I'd never buy again!
2,By far the worst toybiz marvel legends product,This is by far the worst wolverine in the marvel legends edition. The only good thing about this figure is its most accurate to scale in comparison to all other wolverines created. This character is the least wanted in the marvel legends series and for the little effort put into making him.If you're gonna make another version of wolverine make sure it proceeds the last not vice versa.
2,Worst Wolverine of All,"There's uncontestably too many Wolverine figures, but this one takes the cake. The accessories are cumbersome, don't stay on, and don't look cool. Weapon X was a great drawn by Barry Windsor-Smith; it's not so impressive in 3D."
2,"What about Hawkeye, Apocalypse, and Vision?","I own over thirty marvel legends including Wolverine unmasked, Wolverine masked, and Wolverine brown an tan, so I am in no way excludding Wolverine from the Marvel legends series. Series 6-8 were the hardest series to find. I only have Juggernaut, Silver Ironman, Storm, Modern armor Ironman, Iceman, and War Captain America. These were all lucky finds. Out of these three series all I've seemed to find is Punisher and this weapon X Wolverine. I'm not going to buy it because it sucks and it's just plan annoying. You would think that Toy biz would want to sell there great toys by making them available to the masses, but I guess not. I guess they thought Wolverine was the only one that would sell so they made the most of him. It's to bad that he sucks. I hope they rerlease Apocalypse, Hawkeye, and Vision.P.s Why haven't they made a She Hulk? Get with it Toy Biz."
2,Another CRAPTASTIC Marvel Legend!!!,"Why? WHY another Wolverine? The only thing left to make is picks his nose when no one is looking Wolverine. What a waste of plastic. The figure has great articulation but it's an unnecessary figure. The only reason to purchase this is to complete your colletction. Marvel Legends is being plagued with over production of the wrong characters. 3 Wolverine's? 2 Ghost Riders 2? Iron Mans with 4 variants? If you need Wolverine in his underwear, this is for you. If not, you've saved $9.00. Go get lunch! It's much more rewarding than thi sfigure."
1,displeased,"I purchase the easyshare dock 3000/4000 series because i have a dx3215 camera,and the dock was missing the universal insert which helps stablize the camera while charging. I notified the seller and he claimed that it did not come with the dock, However the quick guide and the box stated that it contained the universal insert. How could it with a part missing? the Insert is used to charge the battery. The custom insert that came with my camera was damaged. That's why i ordered the dock so that I could charge my battery. I still can't charge my battery because the camera falls to the side when it is placed on the dock because it has no support."
1,kodak dock,i bought this on the 9-5-02 and havent recived shipping orderyet.is supposed to be shipped in 1 to 2 days what is going onthe money is been taken out of my bank and no email about shipping.
3,Battery doesn't hold charge,I like the ease of the dock but I mainly bought it for the rechargeable batteries. I'll put the camera in the dock & within 5 minutes all three lights are green even though the battery isn't fully charged. I never can get it to charge the 2.5 hours Kodak recommends without constantly taking the camera off the dock & replacing it. I even tried reinstalling the batteries each time but no luck. Maybe I just have a defective battery pack.
1,Kodak EasyShare Camera Dock II,"The camera dock works fine for loading pictures on the computer, but after about a month it stopped recharging the battery pack."
1,Cannot tell if it is working or not,It doesn't appear to be working with my camera. I feel that I've bought an item that is of no use to me. It seems I have spent money on something that I cannot use.
2,Not sure it was worth it for me,"If I were using a desktop computer that had a permanent home, this would be a wise investment. But since I use a laptop and move it around with my wireless network, it's never practical to leave this sitting out, set up, all the time. And that more or less defeats the purpose.Most of the time it's easier to circumvent this and go straight to the camera, particularly since the dock won't work even just to transfer pictures unless it also has the recharging power supply connected too.For non-mobile users, this is convenient, but I don't think it's worth quite what it costs. But if that convenience is worth the cost to you, you can't ask for it to be better done. The dock is stylish and functional, easy to use, and gets the job done. All it really needs is to be priced a little more realistically."
1,FENOMENAL,Es FENOMENAL que tardé esperando el DVD como 3 meses y nunca se me envió a pesar de que mencionan que hay 5 disponibles. Es un gancho para comprar cualquier otra cosa y no enviar lo que realmente vale la pena.
2,The Ball is Good but...,"the straps, mini-balls , and ring are useless.Overpriced item... Search for something else... Work out Hard and Live Happy!!"
1,Suffers from poor editing,"Eoin Colfer's comment ""I love this book"" on the cover was all the recommendation I needed to open it. Unfortunately, despite a lot of well-written pages, Martin Booth's non-fiction writing overtakes great portions of the story and the reader's subjected to boring didactic ramblings. The antagonist is ridiculous and totally unbelievable which ruins the story. I gave it to my daughter to read to get a more age-related opinion, but she enjoyed it less than I did. I feel sorry that Mr Booth was let down by a dreadful editing job, when there was a lot of potential in this premise."
4,Gripping Story,I enjoyed this gripping horror story. It was full of magic and intrigue. I am going to read the sequel.
3,"Beautiful, would be 5 stars, but ...","This watch isn't water resistant. Not even a little bit. The watch is well designed aesthetically, and the materials feel sturdy. I do not need a waterPROOF watch- I will gladly take it off when swimming, doing dishes, etc. That said, just from a practicality standpoint, I do expect that whatever watch I wear will not cloud up after a proper hand washing. I have only worn it for four hours until I noticed it had water condensing after I washed my hands. I shouldn't be expected to have to take it off at the sink every time I wash my hands just to avoid the condensation. This is flu season, so my beautiful watch is staying in its box until I can figure out if a jeweler can make it work in a ""clean hands required"" world."
2,Solaris Knight (Power Rangers),The package arrived as though it had been opened and re-taped. It was beat up like a returned item. The toy didn't appear as it did when ordered. Child lost interest very quickly.
4,what i think,"i really liked this book and i could not stop reading for a second, i actually finished it in about 2 hours and i dont do that normally even if it's a really small book i just don't normally stop to read a book, i recommend this book too anyone but i just wish that it went longer.........but its a great book!"
4,I can't say I didn't like it...but,"I watched this movie wanting to like it so much. Unfortunately, the plot seems to have been made up as the shooting went along. Also, the English dubbing is atrocious and the subtitles didn't even match the spoken dialogue, which may have contributed to the disjointed plot. However, it's worth watching."
3,bullets fly,"Movie was about what I expected. I would not have purchased, if I had to pay full-price. It was ok, for just an average movie."
2,Just a warning about the advertised image.,"I had to return this product, because I thought I was getting the blu-ray combo (blu-ray, and dvd). But when I got it in the mail it was just the blu-ray. Now it would've been my fault if the advertised image had not shown a movie cover with the blu-ray + dvd at the top. For some reason I couldn't exchange it, and I had to order it again, which I decided not to do. So this review has nothing to do with the movie itself. Just a warning for those that might be confused about the advertised image."
2,Let the Bullet Fly,The story was weak and not in harmony. It was a kind of Asian Robin Hood.It's a waste of money to buy such a not well made movie for the sake of entertainment.
1,What's the point?,"The movie has a promising start. We thought we were in for a satire comedy because it's widely considered as one of the best recent Chinese movies. We were wrong. Other than the two sides of crooks throwing punches to each other in extreme violence, there were no redeeming value in sight after 1+ hours of viewing. Maybe the movie has a satisfactory ending but it's not worth wasting another hour. So we just switched it off. Save your time and money."
3,huh?,"a goof ball comedy, with really bad dubbing. It is hardly worth the money, rent it; do not buy it."
1,WTF?,"I'm not going to lie, its the worst movie I have ever seen. Plot, story line, everything, impossible to follow. I thought it was a joke but it kept going. By the way be careful when you go to red box, don't get a POS like this."
3,Let The Bullets Fly,"It is a boring story, right after the begining of the movie I lost interest in watching it,just the firsts10 minutes catches you attention."
3,The comedy is in the dialogues.,"This is a Chinese film in the genre of comedy Western. In itself, the movie is reasonably well made. The actors are obviously solid performers who had fun working together. The problem for Western audience is that the comedy is in the dialogues instead of action, and the Chinese have their own sense of humor that involves a lot of historical and local cultural references. As an overseas Chinese, I have just enough background to sense that some lines were supposed to be jokes, but I often don't know why they were funny. Average American viewers will probably not get them either."
5,Delightful fun...,"When a colleague recommended these videos for my second graders, I was skeptical that it would hold their attention. I was surprised to find that the children were very engaged with the video, often singing along with the songs. The videos are around 40-45 minutes and each teaches a moral lesson. I would say that young children up to age 9 or so would enjoy this video."
1,It would be a 5 but...,"I used to love the Crank Yankers... for about one episode. At the end of the episode I realized THEY'RE A POOR COPY OF THE JERKY BOYS!!! This is pretty good if you're addicted to prank calls, but I highly suggest that you buy the first two Jerky Boys albums as well and just compare the quality for yourself."
3,By far the funniest out of the 3,"This is the funniest album out of the 3 of them. From Niles Standish, to Bobby Fletcher, this CD will bring you joy. One of the best $20 I ever spent. A must have for any Crank Yankers fan. If you are not, you jusy have to take a little bit of time to get used to the humor. Once you are used to it, you will ike it."
1,Huge waste of money,I can't believe I sat and watched the entire season for maybe 3-4 calls that were good.
3,"""Shere"" Drivel","Alas! An intriguing topic and a book with much potential, which is undone by poor writing! Moorcraft is at his worst when he attempts to write dialogue, which is as bad as that in any supermarket variety bodice-ripper. Who could get into the head of a 14th century anchorite? Surely not Mr. Moorcraft.Three stars for selecting an alluring topic, though."
5,"Thank you,Miss Kitt!!!!!!!!!","This collection of Eartha kitt songs is the best.You get every importent song of her career.The sound ,the sleeve design is fantastic.It is expensive but it's worth the money.This box shows Miss Kitt at her best.You get all the hits and some diffrent verisons of some of the hits.This is my birthday present to myself.Eartha kitt is the best singer out there today.She is fantastic!!!Miss Kitt is sexy without ever beeing sleesy.It's a sexiness of the old world.Miss Kitt,thank you for everything you have done!!!You are the greatest!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Needs lots of TLC to work,"Typical when it comes to scanners, always pary that it is going to complete the job."
5,Great story!,We are so happy with this Noah's Ark story book. It tells the story very well and our 3 year old loves it.
4,Really 4.5 stars,"This book is a good sequel to the very well known ""The 101 Dalmations."" It's interesting that many have read the first book but not the second and that's a shame. What's new about this book is that it focuses on the supernatural when dogs can fly and all the people are asleep. It's not for everyone though as some might be put off by it's new age style. If you've read the first book this is worth a look."
1,Dreadful book,"101 Dalmations is a fabulous book in just about any way you care to look at it. The characters are charming and the story moves forward with a purpose. ""Starlight Barking"" has none of the charm of the first book. The characters are not believable and the situation is more contrived than Star Wars Episode 1. That's saying a lot. I will never allow my children to read this book."
4,Wonderful sci-fi sequel to 101 Dalmatians,One of the favorite books of my childhood. I'vebeen waiting impatiently for it to be reissued.
3,Hard to get into -- Almost not worth it,"I like science fiction. But I found this book quite hard to get started. Information is obviously withheld for later in the book that would make the beginning much easier to understand. It is one of those books with a big secret, and once the big secret is revealed, the book is pretty much over. It is a good time-waster, nothing more."
4,Science-Fiction with a message,"""'Damn it,' she cried aloud. 'Can't you see that theoretical answers are no answers at all! It has to be something you can DO!'""Sheri S. Tepper writes engrossing science-fiction. While melodrama is the driving force behind many of the characterizations, the message of this novel goes much deeper than that, addressing such themes as religion and government, guilt and charity, the place of human beings (termed: 'very small being' in a particularly well-drawn scene in the novel) in the future universe, God, class, reproductive rights and overpopulation, and metamorphosis. While it is not a 'Brave New World', it is a sound work of science-fiction, and though it may not break out of this literature ghetto, it is worth however much time you spend reading it, whatever genre you prefer."
4,An accessible book to judge this author,"There's no doubt (to me) that this author has an importantplace in SF. I like to recommend her, but shy away fromsuggesting ""The True Game"" or ""The Door into Womens Country""because I worry that that the reader would have to really,really like fantasy or feminist themes. Grass has depth andmagic and shows why this author can grip the reader. It hasthe added advantage that I would expect the general reader,perhaps even your English teacher would like it."
5,"Vivid, touching, long-lived","I recently had to order another five copies of this book to send to friends; no other book is such an ambassador of science fiction, able to reach people who ""hate"" sci-fi. Tepper's characters are vivid, her worlds are distinct, and the book carries you so carefully onward and upward that you don't realize how far you've gone into her story until you have to set it down. This book is a gift"
5,A Gripping Autobiographical Narrative,"""Look Back and Laugh"" is Jean Desmond's often sad, sometimes funny memoir of life in the Northwestern United States during the 1930s. Desmond is a former model and a very prolific author, who now lives in the Los Angeles area. She tells her story in a cinematic way, which allows the reader to live the sights and sounds of the Great Depression along with her. The old idiom is true: truth is stranger than fiction. Truth can also be more tragic, and at times funnier, than fiction as well. Desmond's tale is both tragic and comic, but always touching. You will be memorized by this book."
5,No problem...,"Received my item in short order...delivery was quick and easy. Item installed in about 15 minutes for my 26"" flat panel TV in my bedroom. Found center stud...marked it, drilled with bit size specified in the instructions, and then mounted the bracket to the wall. Then mounted second piece on the back of the TV, hung and locked the TV to the wall bracket...and it's good to go. Like the flush mount look...very nice."
1,Unavailable products cant be reviewed,My attempt to purchase this item was curtailed by the fact that it can't be shipped to me. But the speed sensor can?I'd have to rate a product that a supplier refuses to sell to me as 0 stars.
5,Survival guide,Cannot get over the excellent condition. Thank you very much. My daughter is going to be so happy to get this.
3,Sheesh,"Welllll...The music from top to bottom is charming and makes me smile (I wish I could say the same for the sound quality.) It's weird...most of ""There Are Eight Million Stories...""sounds pretty solid yet Sunday to Saturday sounds like complete rubbish! The Phil Wilson tracks are a lovely addition to The June Brides tracks. Nice country flavored tracks. All in all I am glad I purchased this but it rubs me in a very very nasty way when one or two tracks are of poor remastered sound quality. I guess I will start seeking out the vinyl."
5,Why aren't they filling stadiums?,"I can't figure out why this band isn't huge. All these songs are b-sides of singles or unreleased tracks. Most bands would kill for songs like these. Southwest and Brother are as good as anything they have done. And listen to the words of Brother, about the clash between Islam and Christianity. Justin Sullivan is so far ahead of his time. This album is a must have for any fan of intelligent rock music."
3,"Not bad, not super duper fantastic","A couple of good trax, its no B-sides and Other Abandoned Tracks..more punky than what i'm used to."
1,Seems like it's just water.,"I'm totally confused by this product. It's not at all what I expected.The green tea extracts I've bought in the past (from other companies) are very dark, almost black, thicker than water and taste very strongly of green tea. This extract, by contrast, is clear and seems like water, all the way to the taste.Maybe they're doing something magical to pack concentrated green tea in there while keeping it looking and tasting like water. I can't tell, because there's no information about the concentration of actual green tea in the product. I sure hope this is more than a 2 oz bottle of weak green tea.At this price, I want to know that I am getting the health benefits of concentrated green tea. I think I'll be returning this."
2,Cliche's Made Palatable for Middle America,"I have an idea. Let's take as many gay cliche's as we can possibly put together in 3 amazingly short segments. Oh wait, we don't have to, it's all here in ""Common Ground"". In the 3rd, 30 minute sement alone we have veterens protesting a gay wedding ceremony, the military dad who doesn't approve, one of the groom-to-be about to run away cause he's unsure, two lesbian caterers, the straight supportive female friend, the gay florist, a third lesbian who is getting sperm from the other groom-to-be to inseminate her on his wedding day and a priest who is rethinking the church's stance on homosexuality. I haven't met all of these citizens of the gay world in my 26 years as an out gay male much less in 30 minutes.I'm all for gay representation in any form, but this is not a flick for the gay community. It is clearly intended for middle american to gain an (unrealistic) glimpse into ""those crazy gays and their antics""."
2,A good collection of stories betrayed by bad filmaking,"I hate to have to disagree with so many positive reviews, but I really couldn't stand this movie. If Jonathan Taylor Thomas, my personal crush, weren't in it, I'd have shut it off after the first twenty minutes. The script is awful, with scenes lending more to groans than tears, and the whole thing is just awfully trite. There is no strong message, no interesting metaphors, no aesthetically pleasing filmography...it's just a really long, really boring excuse to say ""we're here, we're queer, and we're oppressed!""But if you, like me, enjoy drooling over Jonathan, then just fastforward through the first 45 minutes and you'll be all set. It's awfully frustrating, though, to see him portray a gay character when he's not, declaredly, gay. I can only dream!"
5,common ground,i saw this movie on tv in 2000 i like it very much. i like so much that i remembered the story line but for got to remember the title and at last a got the movie on vhs i only wish i could get it on dvd. Anthony
3,A Fair Movie,"Someone's idea of what goes on with the gay life, but mostly colored by Grenwich village types."
3,ok,"It gets the job done, but doesn't have decimal digits so you can't tell exactly how much you have. You just keep weighing until you get what you need but usually are over or under because of the lack of decimals."
4,Good reference,"It is a Good reference book and guide for a darkroom Black and White printer, which is also included some advanced tech."
4,excellent material; examples are not so good,"This a great book where in-depth discussion of techniques is concerned. However, the photographic examples provided are less useful and not inspiring, hence 4 stars. The book has helped me greatly in the darkroom though with my techniques. For informing my aesthetic sense, I can think of better titles. I also recommend Larry Bartlett's Printing Workshop for B+W Photography to supplement this book."
4,Perfect for the average house - entertaining & comprehensive,"This book is perfect for Texas homeowners who want to identify, learn about and control bugs. The writing is entertaining and an amazing number of bugs are included. Loads of pictures."
2,Needs revising,"Informative...yes. Entertaining...kinda.BUT, the author is heavily into chemical solutions. There is no mention of environmental consequences of pesicides, integrated pest management, or organic solutions. Many of the photos were too unfocused, poorly lit, or grainy to be of much use.This book needs a major overhaul."
2,Too sticky and hardly chocolatey,"I was very excited to receive this lip balm, being a lip balm junkie and all, but I was horrified to find that this was much too sticky for me and the smell was not as chocolate-like as i would have hoped...maybe Orangey with a pinch of cocoa.This is for you if you're into that, but its not for me.I love Lush products though and this is the first time they've let me down..."
2,Mostly Oracle Advertising,"Like many people I'm not totally endeared to Microsoft. However this books extreme bias towards Oracle products and negation of Microsoft and others makes me feel that the title could be renamed to: ""The Oracle Guide to buying Oracle e-commerce products"".This fact alone make me read the factual components with a pinch of salt.Sorry Guys."
1,"ok , maybe, no","Ok did the director have his eyes closed during the entire making of this movie? If this movie hade and acadamy award it would probaly be for the crocodiles acting, oh wait! The croc's acting sucked to. But if it didn't, the casting, screenplay,editing,reviseing,stunts,special effects coulad have been better.Ok another thing, if they heard that a gaigantic crocodile was rampaging through Louisiana somewhere or another, would they send mopr than just a sherrif and his fathiful tag a long Don Knotts. Jeez and they really like to shrug of every single charactor... When an old man sell you a bag of crap for a dollar does that signal a good trade? NO! SO STOP BUYING THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,The power of will!,"Harvey Milk is a powerfully realistic film as well as a very documented portrait about one of the fundamental pillars of the gay movement in the seventies in San Francisco. The amazing performance of Sean Penn as Milk, penetrating insights about his private existence, the edition work and the rhythmic vitality of the script ill engage you from start to finish. Special kudos go for Josh Brolin as Dan White in a role that might become his landmark reference for the rest of his lifetime."
5,This film is a must see!,"Let me start by saying I cannot stand Sean Penn, however in this film he did not play Harvey milk, he was Harvey milk!Having seen the Academy award-winning documentary the Times of Harvey milk, it was scary at times watching Sean Penn play him and you could see Harvey milk coming through.If you grew up in the 70s like I did this film is also interesting simply because of the fine job they did of making everyone look authentically 70s, but it makes you feel old, seems like only yesterday I was wearing those close and had that ugly hair style.In my final analysis I believe this film should be shown along with the documentary the times Harvey milk to high school students!This is the history that we missed out on in high school that we should have been taught because this is not just ""gay""history, this is American history!But I'm sure some right wing religious nutcase zealot will have something to say about that!"
3,"Strong performance, so so film","Penn does a great job, but the movie is no grabber. The documentary feel, when a great doc already exists, detracts from what could have been. The audience is never fully engaged in the story. Here the truth is better than the fiction."
5,socially significant cinema,It is as the box proclaims. An instant classic of American films. This Blu-ray presentation is a fitting match for Sean Penn's Oscar winning performance.
4,Movie,This is a Great movie. I Have watched it several times my self and have recommend it to others too
5,great film,i really enjoyed watching this film. the ending is heartfelt and the story is great. it's incredible what these people went through. 2 thumbs up.
3,Trying too hard,Some great acting and a realistic trip back in time to a great era in history. The whole thing comes across as a bit earnest and self-righteous.
4,Milk,"Sean Penn is one of our best actors, especially for his versatility. Milk treats a sensitive subject with restraint, but without compromising the disturbing nature of the events."
4,Exceptional Performances,"This film bio-pic of Gay Right's pioneer, Harvey Milk contains an extraordinary performance from Sean Penn in the title role as well as exceptionally good performances from the supporting cast! Josh Brolin, in what could have been a one note part, does a great job portraying Dan White as a multi-layered person, smitten, confused, and ultimately dangerous to Harvey.There are so many other reviewers on here that have gone onto the storyline with insight much better than I could provide, so I'll conclude by saying that this film is surprising NOT preachy! All of the characters have ""Human"" faults just like everyone else and they are not glossed over. This is the story of one Gay man's fight for dignity and equality in the eyes of the law during a transitional time in American history."
4,simply Marvelous!,"First and foremost, I already love Sean Penn. He is one of the most underated actors of our time next to Ed Norton and Joaquin Pheonix, IMHO But this movie was so different for him and very brave I might add of him to do true thespian that he is!The subject matter is more political than anything, but the character Sean played(Or should I say the real life man)he takes on was gay and full of life, and hope, and energy, and fun. It made me want to know more about Harvey Milk and the cause he started all those years ago.Excellent movie, a must see.It is truly a story in our American history to be told, and Sean Penn did an excellent job!"
5,Sean Penn gives the performance of his career,"""Milk"" is a beautifully told story elevated by the mesmerizing performance by Sean Penn playing Harvey Milk. This is a very important film, that shouldn't be missed. Out of all the films nominated this year for Best Picture, this was the only one in my opinion truly deserving of the nomination and should have won. From the well written screenplay by Dustin Lance Black, to the energetic feel and life brought to the screen by Gus Van Sant's direction. This is the year's best film."
3,Enlightening,"If you are in the dark on Gay history then this movie might help. If you are in the dark on the history of AIDS and why San Francisco is soo much different that other cities then this movie might help. Gays are going through a struggle that most everyone else in America is done with. It must be very very difficult to be a homosexual man and alot of fear must be involved in there day to day lives. Most unfortunate and problematic for both camps involved, the homosexual men and the heterosexual men. It is exceedingly difficult to find a common ground to look to in the future. Maybe the word ""modesty"" could hold some promise."
3,Milk,"Was somewhat disappointed with ""Milk"". I think Sean Penn is a super actor, but not sure this was his best to warrant an Academy Award. I haven't seen the pictures the other nominees were in but hope to do so eventually."
3,Milk,I could not view the DVD due to it would not play on my computer's Blu-Ray Player. I have not had access to a television Blu-Ray player to review.
2,I don't get it,"Like Brokeback Mountain, if Milk didn't have a gay theme, it would be utterly pedestrian. I stopped it half way through. Let's face it, these movies can't be seriously targeted at mainstream America. So I would apppreciate it if Hollywood and the militant gay alliance would STOP trying to fool us into watching this sort of boring knee-tapping balderdash by getting belligerent actors like Sean Penn and Heath Ledger to play in-your-face gay parts and then declaring it a miraculous performance because they can French kiss some dude without throwing up. What an utter sham."
1,He won an oscar for this?,Another over the top performance for Sean Penn! Bland and boring with a storyline that just seems to drag on and on. Yawn.
1,Boring,"If you make a movie you ought to make it interesting and this movie just isn't! It is a boring watch despite the intensity of the subject matter, Sean Penn acted for the purpose of getting an Oscar. If his eyes were already affixed on trophy-hunting, what could anyone expect of his performance? Dull, wrinkled fellow. The movie, in fact, shockingly reinstates many stereotypes', like gay men are always naked and always looking for a lay.The movie is a long ride to super duper boredom. Very poor direction made worse by seriously juvenile small-town theater group acting.E P HARPER -> Please restrict yourself to writing comments for gay porn movies.This is clearly beyond your limited capabilities. Cheers!"
5,"""Milk"" goes beyond the issue of being gay","The movie ""Milk"" shows the impact that Harvey Milk had on human rights and if his movement had failed, America would be changed forever. He did not discriminate in any of his actions and stood up to those who would do physical damage to other people. It also shows that there are people who are attracted to others of the same sex are not openly gay but hide ""in the closet"" and when they decide to let their feelings known do things that may result in the death of other people - like Dan White. It also brought out our need to talk about men who have sex with men. (This is a common method through which the disease of AIDS is spread). The end result was that Anita Bryant was stopped from destroying America as we know it today. I recommend that every person see this movie and follow on with a discussion of sexual orientation or just about sex. America is well behind many European countries in the public discussion about sex and this must stop."
4,Good portrayal of the times....,"I had actually seen the first part of this movie over at a relatives house, and mainly wanted to see the rest of it. Also, wanted to buy a ""used"" video from Amazon to see how it compared with ""new"" videos, so this is not your average ""review"". I like Sean Penn, and thought he did a good job of portraying Harvey Milk, and he didn't try to glamorize him(or ""whitewash"" the facts....). I also grew up during this period, and enjoy seeing movies of this era. I thought it all was handled well, and enjoyed the film. I probably would not have gone to a theater to see this film ~ hubby and I mainly visit a theater for movies with lots of special effects or 3-D or whatever ~ but it was good for home viewing.(Also really enjoyed the fact that a video purchased for a dollar was just like brand new. Amazon is awesome.)"
4,One of the better recent bio-pics,"The assassination of Harvey Milk and the mayor of SF happened in the late 70s and is a somewhat forgotten, though shocking, episode in the gay rights movement. This Sean Penn vehicle nicely brings it all back, and the result is high quality all down the line. Penn's performance is very good. He seems to be making a little specialty of these politically minded bio-pics. I also liked his ""All the King's Men,"" though not everyone did. It's hard to remember just how rough gays had it only a few years ago, and in San Francisco, of all places."
3,Milk,The movie is very well acted. Sean Penn performance is very real and convincible. Sometimes is a little slow but the main subject is very well developed.Milk [Blu-ray]
3,Straight out of Bio-pic 101,"The Bottom Line:Milk begins with the death of its main character (de rigueur for every film in the genre since Gandhi), goes back to when he was a nobody, charts his rise to power and the unfortunate effect it had on his personal relationships (though this time the ""long-suffering wife"" character is a man!) and then sends him to heaven with the wings of martyrdom on his shoulders; this reluctance to rise above the formula of the execrable biopic genre (it even follows the tradition of naming the film as simply the character's surname) dooms the film to mediocrity despite good performances by Penn and a terrific Brolin.2.5/4"
5,A Fantastic Piece,"The central concept of Milk is Sean Penn's heartbreaking portrayal of the life and death of Harvey Milk, our first openly gay politician. Sean Penn totally nails the part, in a transformational performance that is almost too real. The film is graphic and difficult, it's not something easy to watch. This isn't a lighthearted movie to relax with before bed, it's a chilling look at how hard things used to be - and how difficult they still are for a large group of people in our country. Expect to have this one kicking around in your subconscious for a while, and expect to get a lot out of it - just don't expect it to be easy."
1,Dont Buy!!,"Please dont buy this spa n a box. Company doesnt stand behind there warranty. The warranty lady was very rude. I have only had it two month and the cover has came apart. Now the motor is not working, they want me to ship it to them at my cost for them just to look at it.Water doesnt stay warm when you turn on the bubbles goes from 104 to 88 degrees in 5 min.I warn you dont buy this product from anyone."
4,LOVE IT!,I really enjoy my hot tub. The pump is a bit loud but after a while you get use to it. Very relaxing.
4,Leave the cover on while using for warmth,"Just used it for the first time. If you leave the mylar cover (the shiny one, not the inflatable one) mostly on the tub while you're using it, by just unsnapping a few of the connections so you have room to sit, it loses heat much more slowly - we lost 1 degree in 2 hours. Y'all might want to try that.Other than that, it's big, comfortable, not too bad to set up, cheap for a spa. Not sure yet about chemicals or electricity bills. Ours worked fine the first time."
1,PLEASE DO NOT PURCHASE A SPA2GO!!!,"Purchased a Spa2Go in March 09. One month later, had to return powerpack. Refurbished unit we received worked for about 1 month. Emptied for the summer. Filled in Fall. Worked for about 3 weeks. Had to send unit back to Oceantis for repair. They had the nerve to charge us shipping and handling both ways (about $80.00). Worked for six weeks and now it will not hold temperature. Talked to rep today said I'm out of 30-day refurbished warranty would have to pay shipping and handlding both ways again. Powerpack is a piece of junk. Would not recommend this spa to anyone."
4,Took a long time to get the chemicals right,I had alot of problems getting the item. It was delivered to the wrong address in another city (A mistake by UPS). When it finally arrived I was so excited. It was really simple to set it up (even thou the directions or not very clear). The main problem was the chemicals. The advertisement does not tell you about them. You have to purchase the chemicals seperately. It took my husband about 4-5 days to finally get them right. We just had an opportunity to enjoy it this past Friday. It really gave us the spa experience. It felt wonderful. We stayed in about 45 minutes. It lost 5-6 degrees in that time. Overall I really liked it and would buy again. [...] customer service was excellent.
1,poor investment,"Do not waste your money. After six months, my heater went out and the company wanted $108.00 for postage to send me a replacement even tho it had a 1 year warrenty. When I spend $700, I expect it to last more than 6 months. Also, it losed heat very fast, especially in cold weather."
1,RUN away as fast as you can,"I bought 2 of these and 4 motors later when I finally realized DUH this is piece of **** They are good for only about 6-8 months before the problems begin..and then watch out..SERVICE is terrible and only Comfort line can work on it in Florida VERY expensive to ship back and forth..If they only lasted longer it would be worth it..just too many problems and I really gave it a try and bought 2 of them...I just gave up when the pump kept crapping out, the filter dissolves into A REALLY BIG MESS and they are 25 dollars each usually only sold in 2 paks.....SAVE your money and get a REAL hot tub...."
1,Horrible,"We've had our spa since Nov. 09, the first filter leaked and we sent it back within the first 30 days, the replacement lasted 4 months. Overheat keeps flashing, the representative said a 'sensor' needs to be reset. Not ready to pay the S&H; and labor cost if it's going to keep doing this. Customer service stinks.We're in for a class action suit, and watching to see if someone on this link finds a fix.For more reviewshttp://www.amazon.com/discussion forumsspa2go"
1,Honeymoon is over.,"At first we loved this spa. It was cofy, large enough, affordable. But then the filter started making really loud noises. They walked us through these problems. We got a couple of years out of it. Then the filter died completely. We paid to fix it and six months later, it's dead again. It cost $75.00 just to ship it off! Im not doing that again.Then there is the liner. The liner leaked and a seam separated. We were under warranty, so they sent us a new liner and it ONLY cost $100 for shipping, etc. So now the middle ring is deflating.I am deflated.I can't afford another spa and within just a few days, our tub is leaking and the filter is dead. I have called the company, but they just emailed me instructions and those instructions didn't work. WHen I called back, I got voice jail.I'm frustrated. But what did I expect from a blow up hot tub? By the way, this has been in an enclosed sun porch on concrete since we got it."
3,Slight problem!,"Love this product except after inflating and filling with water I discovered it had a slow air leak in middle ring. It was a few days after before it was obvious. I did not want to empty water and try to patch leak so soon after filling so I have to add more air every couple of days. I will try to fix leak after I have used it for a while longer. So I guess so far, I have to say it is OK if you don't mind surprises!"
1,The pump self-destructs within 2 years!,"We got this tub about a year and a half ago and the pump has broken down three times. My husband is an engineer and was able to jimmy rig a fix to get it up and going, only to have it break down again. There is no option with the company to send them the pump to replace it, once it stops working you have to buy a whole new pump system which was over $250. Check out reviews on other web sites for Spa-In-A-Box and you will see the pump is a common issue with owners. Beware that if you buy this spa that you will probably get a year's worth of use out of it trouble-free then it is Russian roulette and once something breaks down on it you are on your own. The company is not helpful in any way. Also beware that you need to put some sort of additional cover over the pump housing because the housing is not weatherproof and if water gets into the housing you are screwed as this will break down the pump."
1,"Works nicely, but will only last 3 months","I purchased this spa about a year and a half ago. It is very easy to set-up and is very comfortable. The problem has been that the power pack unit that comes with the spa doesn't last very long. I had to replace mine 3 times. Each time it was under warrently but still cost $89 shipping to replace it and took some back and forth with their customer service. After the 1 year point, I now have to pay $420 to replace the power pack. It's just not worth it if it's only going to last 3 months.So... buyer beware. As I've gone this over the last year and a half, I've learned that this a common experience with people who have purchased this product."
3,spa2go,"Although I had some problems with the product, the manufacturer made it right and the spa measures up to expectations. We do enjoy it. It is a bit bigger than anticipated. While in use the spa will lose about 8 to 10 degrees in temperature. Still plenty warm enough."
2,Fine for short-time use...wont last long,"I have had mine for 5 years...first pump died after one year....second pump ($180 part and hard to find) lasted a couple years....heater element went about 4 years into it...cover fell apart after 3 years....vinyl liner is wrinkled with small leaks beyond (further) repair.Buy the tub with the expectation it will last a year and you'll be happy but if you're looking for a real hot-tub you can reliably enjoy for years, this is not it....and you'll need to spend a lot more."
3,You Get What You Pay For,"I ordered this item through Radio Shack to play my MP3 radio shows. At first, I was impressed with the sound. I had been warned that the controls were a little clunky, and it was a little difficult to get the cds in and out because of the way the ""hood"" opens, but I could put up with that. What I hated was the way, as the other folks have said, it cuts off the end of each program as it goes on to the next. I would think that Memorex would be well aware of the problem. It does, however, seem to play regular cds just fine."
2,Does not play the complete mp3 track,"It skips the last 30 seconds of all mp3 tracks. That is rather disgusting. Plus, inability to play the lower bit rates without garbling it beyond recognition makes this product a loser. The analog FM tuner is a pain. sound quality is so and so. I bought an iRiver SlimX 350 following this fiasco. That product rocks.. Check that out instead."
4,Great for the price,"Works as expected, perfect for listening to OTR shows. I LOVE it.It is not expensive, cute, small, and not noisy like a computer. It sits next to my bed at night grinding out old time radio shows like a champ. Buy one and see."
2,MP3 CDRW playback lacking,"Tried this in a store with two ordinary MP3 CDRWs (both burned at 4x speed). Neither was recognized as an MP3 CDRW - the unit just sat there, mute.(Playing back MP3 CDRWs is pretty much all that I would do with a unit like this, so I didn't test the other functions very much. The radio seemed to work well.)The search for a boombox that works as well as the Rio Volt line of personal players moves on..."
4,An *Okay* buy,"I've received this product a couple of days ago, and it seems to work fine enough... The major problem I've noticed is, it skips the end portion of the mp3 songs I have burnt on to my CD. Something like the last 30 seconds of each song is chopped off, which is rather annoying at times.Good point is, it recognized all of the 183 mp3's burnt on my CD effortlessly. But navigating through it is a real pain-Also, the FM tuner is a knob controlled one, which makes precise tuning rather tedious. A digital tuner is definitely a must.Sound quality is ""okay"", not bad, but some tweeting effect noticed at some higher frequencies.Overall, I don't think it's worth 80 bucks. I had a 25 buck discount coupon, and so I don't feel so cheated;Good enough if you aren't too particular about too many things.."
2,Cuts Off Endings,"Purchased for the sole purpose of playing MP3 CD format Old Time Radio shows. Great looking unit, nice visual display, radio works fine and sounds good, but cut off the ending of ALL shows (5-minute show, cut off 30+ seconds; 30 minute shows, cut off last 5-7 minutes)."
4,Sensitive and intelligent work that shouldn't be ignored.,"It is a blessing that we live in an age where the subject of gender identity disorder can be discussed in such an intelligent and scholarly manner. It is a blessing because there are many individuals who suffer from said disorder and often go untreated. Those who are unhappy and seeking enlightenment on the topic of gender identity would benefit tremendously from this work, which offers a glimpse of hope in the form of the unbiased compassion of authors Zucker and Bradley. This is not, I repeat not a work to be feared and distrusted. It is a book of hope for many."
1,It is VERY bad!,"Com'on, guys! What are you talking about! This is a very boring book. Characters are dull and one dimensional. Action is predictable and based on stereotypes. Nothing for those who are IN Since Fiction, and of course it is not a literature. Sorry, for such a negative review. I understand that the author made a big deal of an effort to write it, but... no, it is REALLY bad!"
2,Disappointed in Memorex MX4100,"The unit works well enough (except for the light on the left speaker which doesn't work at all) but the speakers seem [inferior] and are very lightweight. They don't give a clear, crisp sound. The radio also doesn't seem to receive local stations very clearly.I don't want to be overly negative but on the whole, I think I wasted my money."
1,I don't reccomend this item!,"If you are looking for a stereo with great sound, don't buy this! The sounds didn't work good at all! The speakers had to much static in them even when I played a CD. Even it's looks are great the system isn't."
4,not bad price for what you get....,this is definately worth the money. great features for something so small and compact. i am also working on getting better reception on some of the stations (not sure if it is me or the radio). i would reccomend this to my friends.
4,"Worth your money,great quality","I have had this stereo for 2 years now,and have had no problems.The quality is great,espicaly with the X bass and EQ.the radio works great and the antenae is cool because it is a wire and it's very easy to get the right channel.the lights on the speakers are awesome,it adds a cool effect.the only problems that i have had (besides loosing the remote in a move accross the country) is that you get a fussy sound using the EQ with the volume turned under 7,and it doesn't play burned CD r's very well,you usaly have to skip to the second or third track and the go back to the first.an all around great product,cheaper than some,but has great quality."
1,Horrible System,"I bought this system a few days after Christmas because it was on sale. I thought it looked like a cute little system for my dorm room, and the sound in the store wasn't too bad. I took it home and set it up to try it out. When I played a CD, there was so much static. But I liked everything else, so I thought I'd keep it. Later that night, I went to turn on the system and nothing happened. I finally got it to turn on using the remote, but the back lights didn't work, you could barely see the display, and none of the buttons on the system worked, only the remote. I took it back the next day and exchanged it for a Panasonic SA-PM12, which is so much better and I love it!"
3,Great Looks but missing something!,The other detailed review here pretty much says all except the fact that this product is without a cassette player. Sort of like a computer w/out floppy.. Might be okay for some but not everyone.
4,Works,Used it with a Trendnet wireless camera and installation went well. Couldnot use the built in heating element with the wireless camera.Very sturdy enclosure.
3,Okay but...,"Product is okay but it's not particularly dense in plankton. I'm not expecting a thick slurry of plankton but even so, the amount of plankton you get is pretty low compared to water amount."
3,Kent Marine ZooPlex,This product arrived in a timely manner. price was fair. My fish don't really eat this stuff but I noticed that my corals and other stuff in the tank seem to like it? I prefer Marine Snow over this stuff but still use both for my saltwater tank. I'm not totally sold on this product but I would recommend it to others to try.
2,Absolutely useless for economists and finance pros,"I give this book two stars from an econometrician's point of view. This book focuses on linear models related to ANOVA and hence may have a good audience in disciplines such as statistics, biostatistics, etc, but it has ABSOLUTELY nothing useful for people interested in econometrics or financial statistics.For example, the book doesn't even mention heteroskedasticity at all, and there's absolutely no time series coverage. In econometrics we also do weighted regressions a lot, and this book doesn't have anything.I wish the book title had been more descriptive. Linear models are many stripes and used in many different disciplines. By using such a catch-call title, the book is misleading.So, if you want to do linear models in economics or finance, do NOT buy this book."
5,the Best in gluten-free products,"I've tried several gluten-free product mixes and I've made my own from ""scratch"". This product and all other gluten-free Bob's Red Mill products are of the highest quality. I can rely on this product each and every time!Well worth the money."
2,Not convincing.,"Taking pictures of nuts and bolts is not very convincing, the pictures could be of either ship. I find it more believable that Morgan would want his money back by switching ships than pictures supposedly taken of a particular bolt. Also, the pictures do not show dates of the photos, and their explanations of controversial letters and conversations are not convincing. Save your money."
5,Breakthrough in the field of economics,"This book is a demonstration of profound economic thought, and will soon change the way in which the world views economics."
5,Excellent for Vegiterian with Fish Gelatin,Very effective product. I am in the market to look for any product without having gelatin and I found this item with Fish Gelatin which is my main concern that I bought this. I am a vegi and fish eater.
1,"Memorex products are cool, but.....","The MC-3800 that I got had a weak front end (Receiver)and poor sound quality at lower volume levels. The equipment is designed well and functionality is great but fails to produce the sound quality of receivers that are a fraction of the cost. The CD player works great but there again, the lower volume sound levels sound distorted or deminished."
1,bulk-o-rama,"Compared to other models (especially by Sony) this one is quite the clunker! It's very big and hangs down low. It seems very low tech. Once you get a quick look at it, you can tell that design is not a factor at all. Spenda little more and get something cool and sleek that you'll use for years to come."
5,Wonderful story,I loved this book. It's an honest and revealing story of a man who is half American Indian and half Caucasian and the struggles that he goes through. Greycloud has a very appealing sense of humor that shines through in this story. I also found the history of the time period when he was a young boy and young man to be very interesting. It's an easy and entertaining read.
3,just nice book,The book is goodBut it could be better .it is interesting.nice to know more about Ángel .easy to understand

1,Philips... NEVER AGAIN!!!!,I bought this product to go along with our HD big screen because was told that this was a great model. We paid $140 for it in January of 2003. worked fine. We maybe played 5 to 6 DVD's in it over a period of 5 months and went to pop in a DVD and NOTHING..No power to it at all. Wouldn't open or do a single thing. Took it back to Best buy where we bought it and they said we can sent it out but it will cost you. Came home and called Philips and they told me after 90 days they wouldn't repair or exchange for free. BUT if I want the will replace it for $39.99 and you have to pay shipping to get it there and back. So for another $60 I can get a new one. What a bunch of crap. Customer service is a joke!!
1,zERO STARS WOULD BE MORE LIKE IT!,"My Philips DVD Player 724 ""malfunctioned"" (that's the term the tech help line used)after approximately a dozen uses. I personally think that is just a stock answer the tech help line gives because they don't want to bother to help you they just want to charge customer to replace it.Naturally I missed the no charge exchange warranty date by about a month-Purchased it Jan. 24, 2003- malfunctioned May 30, 2003. Have to pay $$ to exchange for another one that may work.I would not deal with Philips-the products stink and so does their warranty."
4,"Very Good DVD Player, Has Quite a Few Tricks","The great: Plays all formats without hesitation I've thrown at it including raw mpegs, svcd, vcd, dvd-r, cd-r, mp3 + raw jpeg disks. Other's indicate issues in reviews I've seen here, hey; I've had none, player works like a charm. Player can be set for region free operation if needed.Only drawback is the remote is a 3 on a scale of 1 to 5. No backlight, cheap, keys are tiny and non intuitive."
3,Shady Preformance,"I bought this DVD player at xmas time and thought it'd be perfect, I love the digital outs on it, they work great with my home theater(which has its own DD and DTS decoder); however, sometimes it freezes after just 10 min. sometimes it won't even read my DVD's. That's strange enough, but even stranger is that if I take a disk out and put it back in it usually works. Overall it's pretty good, but the mechanics of it leave me puzzled."
1,Consistently bad --- avoid at all costs,"What a disappointment this unit has been. We get the DVD player home, start watching a movie, and at about 1 and a half hours in, the movie freezes solid. The unit freezes up. The controls don't respond. You have to turn it off physically and restart it. This happens with most DVD's, brand new, rented, it doesn't matter. So, we returned it, still under warranty, and got a replacement. Guess what? It does the same thing! I spent hours trying to resolve this with Philips. They sent me a ""firmware upgrade,"" which should've corrected the problem. Did it work? Let me put it this way: I still don't know how Three Kings ends. Talk about frustrating. What a total piece of junk. Philips should be ashamed of themselves. Please, whatever you do --- LOOK ELSEWHERE."
2,Poor CD sound quality,"I tried this unit for one day before returning it. The sound was utterly terrible, and not for any obvious reason indicating a defect. It was muddy, and seemed quite distant. I looked at the specs, and they are quite poor regarding signal to noise ratio (80 db while a good player can attain 100+ Db) and some other items, indicating that the digital to analog converter in this unit is very cheap and low grade. Maybe if you use the coax digital output you'll do great. But not if you are plugging this thing into an old fashioned amp and using its built in converter.I did like the 5.1 analog outputs since I don't have a modern receiver, but I am sure the sound coming out would be crap, so why bother."
2,Disappointing,"Before I Ordered the DVD724AT I did some research at the Philips website. After recieving my player, I discovered that Philips dosent have (at their web site)the correct specifications as to what features this DVD player has. For one, this DVD unit DOES NOT have the 5-Disk resume feature that is posted at the philips web site, along with many other online retail sites. And two, the unit DOES NOT have a Built-in dolby digital decoder, which was also posted at the site.I Just wanted to clearify these issues with anyone who is interested in buying this product, before Philips updates their databases.As for the quality of the product. It seems very well built and does have a lot of features. But some how im disappointedI hope this review helped you"
1,don't bother,This machine was nicely priced and has a lot of features. I noticed at first that it skipped and froze and assumed it was defects on the discs. The same with new discs. It got to the point it was impossible to watch a movie. I tried cleaning it only to have the thing completely konk out. My warrantly is expired... Be warned.
1,Didnt work after a 2 month use...,"I thought this dvd player was a great buy since it had component output for my HDTV screen (which was also a Philips)...needless to say, the people who reviewed this were right: bad quality product. This one just started freezing and then finally lost the picture...I never touched the configuration section so it had to be something internal. I decided that it was cheap enough to let go...I guess I'm back to buying a Pioneer player instead...."
2,Great... when it worked,"This was a great buy for the first 3 months I owned it. This was until the output video completely died. At least the audio still worked. Every single video output all of a sudden is broken. Tried every type of cable, tested the TV, even running it through my VCR... dead screen. I've never owned any electronics product that only lasts 3 months."
3,Dolby Digital / DTS Decoders not in this unit,"For those of you who are wondering about the debate regarding whether or not this unit has built-in Dolby Digital and DTS decoders... The answer is no.This unit does (like pretty much all DVD players), have digital outputs that allow it to connect to your receiver with built-in Dolby Digital / DTS decoding.But, if you're looking for a player that decodes those formats, and provides the 5.1 channels of sound in the form of RCA audio jacks, then you need to look elsewhere.Philips model DVD Q35 does include a built-in Dolby Digital / DTS decoder. (That model is also known by the designation: DVDQ35AT )"
2,stressed out movies,looks great....thats it....tried watching movies on it...when it worked on my hi-def xbr it was great...when it worked. most of the movies stopped or fraze halfway.....
1,Where are 5.1 channel analog output jacks,"I read a review by tew02 from Southern California, USA saying this model (Philips DVD724AT ) has built in Dolby Digital Decoder and supports 5.1 channel analog output. This is claimed by even Philips and Bestbuy websites. I checked this model in BestBuy showroom but it does not have 5.1 channel analog output jacks. Does anyone know if these jacks exists on this model ? If not this model then is there any other DVD player of any good brand which has 5.1 channel analog output in approx. same price range?"
1,My experiences with Philips DVD724,"My Philips DVD724AT died approximately 4 months after buying it, right after the warranty expired. It simply stopped working one day out of the blue. Before it quit working, my main complaint was the output volume level was far too low, whether or not ""dynamic range control"" was enabled. Needless to say, I will not be replacing it with another Philips."
2,Nothing special,"I didn't see any noticeable gains, later I tried Creapure by Optimum nutrition much better."
4,About SizeOn?,"Well, first of all, let me tell you that I bought this product with a great expectation.Now let me tell you my experience:- I felt no diffence in my reps or weight lifted- Before I tryed with creatine monohydrated and I felt a grate change but it was difficult to drink it. Now with this is a little bit easier because it has flavor.- I tryed SuperPump frutipunch and I love that flavor, really deliciuous, thats why I was specting something similar. deaaaaaam this SizeOn taste awfull!!.. disgusting!... really bad flavor....- Despite the flavor, I'm noticing a volume increment in my muscles regarding to the creatine effects.- As a creatine effect you did not feel so tired after workout.I just have 1 week taking it, so lets see what happen when I finished my tub."
2,No results but it tastes fine,I'm just about through with one container of Gaspari SizeOn and haven't seen or felt any results. I train hard and I've had no additional increase in size from using this product. Tastes fine though.
2,HORRIBLE TASTE,"I am totally unable to drink this stuff, literally impossible. And this is coming from a guy that goes to Japan 2x's a year and eats raw horse meat by the pound and cow intestines by the plate (Korean BBQ). I love almost all foods and can stomach pretty much anything. Actually, I think this is the first thing I have been unable to consume because it does taste that bad (Grape Blast)!I have used the SizeON pill form previously with wonderful results and will go back to the pill form."
2,Eh...,"Taste was ok, but didn't like the little floating peices of glycerol(I think thats what they were) throughout it and really bad once you got to the bottom. Didn't see much difference from this from Kre-akalyn, my previous creatine. Although didn't get that long to test it, only used for about 10 days until i accidentally left it in my car and the extreme heat of the day hardened and ruined it(Leaving in my car does nothing to my NO-Xplode, so assumed this would be fine but was very wrong). After that my brother and I tried to use it for a couple more days, each day we got horrible, horrible stomach aches and pains from it. DO NOT LEAVE THIS IN HIGH HEAT."
1,Are you freakin serious?,"I wanted to try the Gaspari stack, so I went ahead and ordered this after ordering Superpump 250 from another seller. It was a good thing too, as I was very low on creatine when my packages arrived. Low and behold, I got my superpump 250, and started to open the package that was supposed to have my Sizeon to find: a 1.78 pound jug of SUPERPUMP 250! Are you serious? I looked around the bottle, and there it was: somebody had a put sticker label on the jug of SUPERPUMP 250, as Gaspari Nutrition 2.84 pounds Sizeon Grape flavored. Wow... somebody needs to be fired. IT SAYS SUPERPUMP 250 ON THE JUG! HOW COULD YOU THINK IT IS SIZEON?! AND WASN'T IT WEIRD THAT YOU STUCK A STICKER FOR A PRODUCT THAT IS 2.84 POUNDS ON A 1.78 POUND CONTAINER?? So now I have 2 jugs of Superpump 250 and 0 sources for Creatine.. And superpump 250 was something I was just trying out, but now I have to like it having 2 OF THEM. Thanks."
4,Native American wars...with a new twist,"This book is a compilation of almost all Native American Wars, including why they happened, thier relevance to society, and their relevance to you paper in general. Definetly a good book to get if you are writing a paper or just want to learn about the social impact war had on Native American and European culture or interactions!"
4,Extremely Comprehensive,"If you are interested in ALL the battles and skirmishes in the west, this book is for you. I was amazed to see how many fights took place in my part of the country. The author has done extensive research, but I could do without the occasional editorializing when defending the U.S. Cavalry."
5,"A ""must have"" reference for U.S. and western history.","When an important yet underresearched subject in U.S. western history is tackled by a skilled scholar and author such as Gregory F. Michno, the result is a ""must have"" book. Most scholarship on U.S.-Indian conflicts has concentrated on a few of the more dramatic battles and campaigns of the 1870s. Michno has done historians and history buffs a great service by producing a sound ""ready reference"" that covers the events of four additional decades. His research is extensive and his style clear and concise. A section of general conclusions at the end corrects many popular misconceptions about the western frontier and its Indian conflicts. All of this information comes at an unusually reasonable price. Public and school libraries should definitely consider purchasing this book along with John D. McDermott's Guide to Indian Wars of the West.Dr. Michael A. Hughes, Editor-Emeritus, Journal of the Indian Wars"
5,WONDERFUL,Wonderful. I could listen to it forever. I love the older music. They are some of my favorites. Beautiful. Brings back wonderful memories.
3,3rd hand,Used this a couple of times. I would recommend having two of these for hanging drop cloths off of them for a plastic barrier. Also to hold up any materials for you to adjust and then nail in accurately.
1,Not In Concert,"This is a cheap compilation of excerpts from Rosie's TV show and not a concert performance as the title suggests. The video and sound quality is average and the selection of songs is uneven. She lip-syncs to Nelson Riddle's fine arrangements while fiddling with props on a sterile, cartoonish set that looks like a children's show. In many sequences, she is pregnant and hiding behind windows and giant bows. Also released as ""Rosemary Clooney Singing at Her Best."" For hardcore fans only who may enjoy the extra interview with Edward R. Murrow."
5,Love the Mandolin and Clarinet,"I've recently became a fan of David Grisman and Andy Statman. There are some real cool mandolin riffs in this album, lots of tremelo, lots of emotion. And the clarinet playing ain't bad either. It's all acoustical, and ranges from the happy and upbeat ""David Melech Yisrael"" and ""Toska"" to the emotional and melancholic ""Shalom Aleichem"", and ""Adon Olam"" a tune that sticks to you. ""Kazatski"" shows Grisman's virtuosity on the mandolin. If you love the Dawg, get this album. It shows the enormous range of musical styles he has."
3,Boring,"I love mandolin, I love clarinet, and I love klezmir music. Most of the songs on this album, while beautifully played by great musicians are BORING. They sound like background music to dull scenes in ""The Godfather"". One Mandolin duet is brilliant and a couple of other cuts are very good but, my advice: listen to the entire CD before buying. Not just the snippets that Amazon allows you to hear. I did that and was still disapointed."
4,This release IS NOT A BOOTLEG!,"Contrary to a previous posting, THE BIONIC WOMAN has been legally and officially released in both the UK and France by Universal. Season 1 is available as of this date in both countries, and I believe I saw an advert for Australia as well. Other 3-episode discs were officially released prior to the Season 1 set in the UK. They are, of course, Region 2/PAL discs. SIX MILLION DOLLAR MAN has also been released similarly.I have seen these discs, and the quality is excellent, by the way.Why the series is being held up in the States is beyond me, especially with the plethora of choices we have out already.I respectfully request that posters do their research, or at least make sure they know what they're talking about, before posting erroneous information for public consumption."
5,THE REAL GOOD TV,COME ON THE BILLION DOLLAR MAN AND THE BIONIC WOMEN ARE U KIDDING ME?!! WHEN TV WAS EVERYTHING AND LESS CRAP WAS ON IT CAUSE NOW THESE DAYS ITS PURE TRASH TV!!!! BUT LIKE THESE PHENOMINAL TUBE BRING THE ORIGINALS BACK AND STOP CREATING ALL THIS HORRIBLE TRASH CUZ IT STINKS I HATE REALITY TV IT COULDNT BE MORE FAKE!!!
4,Lindsay Wagner won an Emmy,"Although she didn't win an Emmy award until about the third season, I enjoyed this show a great deal at the time. I'm hoping that the show will be released on DVD. The episode that Lindsay won an Emmy for Best Actress in a Dramatic Series was the 2nd or 3rd time she played a dual role as Jamie and as Lisa. In that episode, both women suffered identity crises. Jamie was institutionalized and drugged, and they tried to ""brainwash"" her into thinking she was her ""twin"" (by plastic surgery.) Lisa, on the other hand, had convinced herself that she truly WAS Jamie, and longed for Jamie's sense of family she had with relatives. That two-part episode is my favorite of all. When Oscar Goldman tests Jamie's hearing from hundreds of feet away, she responds, ""Oscar, I can hear you! I can hear you!"" my heart always skipped a beat, because Oscar KNOWS it's Jamie. I DO hope they release at least THAT episode, because it is by far the best one."
1,WARNING: THIS IS A BOOTLEG RELEASE ONLY!,"This series is NOT on DVD legally anywhere, which is why Amazon doesn't carry it themselves but rather only through third-party sellers. Don't support poor-quality bootlegs put out by international criminal cartels."
3,Background On The Songs,"This book contains every Beatles' song ever recorded and gives a short write up about who wrote that particular song, the instruments used and the background behind it. The book also includes a chapter about artists who tried to pass their own work off as that of the Beatles. very intereting for musicians and music historians."
4,Country Women paperback,"One of my favorites. Most practical book. I built my goatshed from directions in this book. Also has the words to the poem about wearing purple. Some views about women's rights seem dated now, but the climate of oppression that spawned those views is part of our history. Lots and lots of great advice about making it on your own in the country, about building relationships with other women."
4,classic,This is a classic. I've kept in my libary since it was orginally published. It has inspired me in my country lifestyle and now I have bought a copy for my daughter as I am unwilling to part with my own.
1,The Rhino disc is the way to go.........cat go!,"If you are looking for one disc of Carl Perkins, don't buy this one. The Rhino disc was mastered MUCH better. With this CD, the sound quality is all over the map, unlike Rhino's which is consistent sounding without all the clicks and pops that show up on a lot of the songs on this CD. Also, the Rhino disc has all the key songs for beginners or those who just want a Carl Perkins disc that's free of filler."
1,Horrible Customer Support,"Wow, not only did the whole unit not work, but the customer support is the worst I've ever seen of any group. They actually lied twice during my support ticket and then later went back and said ""we couldn't reveal that information earlier"", except that is was 180 degree conflicting to what they now said. Then they started threatening legal action if I said anything on user groups. All I wanted was for the unit to be used on Windows Vista, which, like another reviewer here, it should as the packaging says ""PC or Mac"", not ""Windows XP SP1 and Mac OS 9"".Unbelievably horrible product and customer support. Run far away from this company."
1,Fast Track and Vista,I have not been able to use it because the software is not compatable with Windows Vista. The packaging merely said for use with PC or MAC. According to M-Audio customer service they do not know when or if a patch will be produced but they would let me know. So I'm stuck with a useless box of expense.
1,One star is one too many,"Ordered March 16th with two-day delivery. Arrived May 1st. Can't open the box if I plan to return it, which I do. However, extensive searches suggest this box has low gain and NO Windows Vista compatibility. Software functionality is limited. By the time one upgrades the software one might as well have gone with the 4x4 using ASIO but that requires third party drivers because M-Audio drivers are the pits."
3,thinking,this product is cool if u r looking 4 a new entry lvl pre amp . However i do recommend saving to buy a more upscale version . As there is little gain from turning knobs all the way up . This is my first pre amp so i am happy but i still feel like i just should have waited . The price i am sure will draw some in any way . Oh and u have 2 up grade to get full use of the software wich is like 60 bucks . So shop around first and read lots of reviews . Amazon was great as always thanx 4 a good deal . Peace and light .
5,Encyclopedic,"Everything you want to know. Plus a great ""cookbook"" of color recipes that I plan to laminate for future reference."
3,"Full of information, but why?","Debbie Menz is a fiber artist, and knows color like no one else. Yet I wonder why the processes have to be so lengthy and difficult? I let my grandsons--6 and 8 years old--dye some fiber this summer and spun it up randomly and ended up with wool looking similar to hers with minimal effort. The book is worth buying for the color theory, but I think there are less time consuming ways to produce the same spectacular yarns."
5,"Learned a lot about color, dyeing and fiber","Coming from a formal art background, I really appreciate this book. Not only does it cover the basics of dyeing and carding/combing well, but it also provides lessons in color (beyond the basic color wheel) where you directly see the results of mixing and using different color combinations. There are samples of finished knitted pieces using similarly-colored yarn yet with slightly different properties. Readers are encouraged to use the exercises for future self-directed study. Great cataloguing ideas are offered.I highly recommend this book!"
4,Star wars card are awsome,"They are fun,they could help with math and reading skills.They have information about the characters."
5,Looks inside the pysche of an islamic mind,"Muhammad's(PBUH)life has been a struggle for upholding an ideology and the strong theme that comes out of the Quran is the struggle against odds. Unfortunately, it is all to easy to interpret (wrong or right) the Quran to incite illiterate and poor masses and focus their emotions to negative acts. This has repeatedly happened in history. People often say to be that they judge a religion by what people do not what they say. People do what they do because QURAN allows for easy interpretation by elements."
1,DISTORTION,"A POORLY WRITTEN BOOK,WITH MULTIPLE DISTORTIONS AND QUOTATIONS INTERPRETED TO CONFORM TO A POLITICAL AGENDA.MUSLIM TERRORISM IS A SERIOUS THREAT WE ALL MUST BE CONCERNED ABOUT,HOWEVER THE HISTORY OF VIOLENCE AND ASSAULTS ON OTHER COUNTRIES IS NOT PARTICULAR TO ISLAM. ISLAM IS NOT JUST A RELIGION,IT IS A POLITICAL RELIGIOUS AND ECONOMIC IDEA.THE AUTHOR'S """"research""WAS SELECTIVE AND IT IS EVIDENT FROM THE FIRST FEW PAGES HIS ONE SIDED PRECONCEIVED NOTIONS ABOUT ISLAMIC AND WORLD HISTORY IN GENERAL."
1,Absolutely horrible,"Although the book is well written from a literary point of view it holds no historical or political merits whatsoever. The historical accounts are horribly inaccurate and the political views are so skewed that about half way through the book I decided to return it to Amazon. I recommend to any reader who is interested in the subject matter to take an Islamic history class, Middle Eastern history class or an early Jewish history class at a college or university instead."
5,Challenging and fun,"My three year old nephew just got this book and loves it. He examines each page carefully and shouts ""a clue! a clue!"" whenever he sees the trademark blue paw print. He also informed me that he likes ""that guy"" meaning Steve, the genial young TV host. A cute book with lots of colorful stickers."
5,repeated favorite,My daughter loved and continues to love this book. I think because it has stickers she picks this book up to read on her own many times.
4,Great book!,"I bought these books at party favors for my 2-year-old's birthday party and they are a total hit with all of his friends. My only complaint is that it took the ""in-stock"" book almost a month to get all of the copies that I ordered."
1,CRAP,"This thing is flimbsy, there are no seconds on the display, and it sounds pretty bad. You should get a Phillips or Panasonic."
2,Don't buy it for the AC adapter,"I got this for a great deal of [$$]. Unfortunately, I bought it thinking it would come with the promised AC adapter--no such luck. I am still deciding whether or not to return it. I can't comment on the sound, as I haven't opened it. I am rather disappointed with Amazon. I discussed the missing AC adapter with customer service weeks ago, yet they haven't bothered to update the description of it so that others do not buy the product on the false belief that it can run off of outlet power."
4,A story for a seeker,A very interesting story where one of the characters which is a scientist discovers his intuitive side but do not want to accept it. The other characters will help him in this journey so he can accept his true nature. This character can be anyone of us in our society where science is overpowered and nothing is true if it has not been proven by science. This book helps the seeker to make some steps in the way with the example of the main character of this book.
3,"Vro-o-om, vro-o-om",An independent biker film with cheap production values and a swiss cheese plot that will probably become a cult classic in a few years. Hard to follow the theme in some places. Utterly forgettable. I will probably give my copy away.
2,The Manson Ranch!,"Ross Hagen told me, in an interview, that the movie was shot at the Manson Ranch before the killings! He didn't say whether Manson was there, but he did say that his wife Claire was so unnerved by the Manson clan that she couldn't play her parts... and so they had to bring in another actress!"
5,These Guys Can Play,"I saw these two geniuses at Town Hall in New York last month, and of course they had me on the edge of my seat, in awe, the whole 3 hours. I knew it would be an incredible show, but I didn't realize just how incredible. This cd doesn't quite capture the atmosphere of a thousand satisfied customers whooping it up at the end of each song, and Doc Watson grinning ear to ear, or David Grisman's unbelievably relaxed attitude while playing even the most complicated, extended soloes. But that's stuff you have to see. This cd is fantastic. The atmosphere's like at a coffeehouse or something, where the audience is there, but silent, and the musicians are just a few feet away. It's just the two of them (with an occasional third man, Jackson, on guitar) trading soloes the whole way, with a mostly traditional bluegrass sound, except for on Summertime, the old Gershwin jazz tune, which people shouted for at the concert. I wish they'd release a lot more of these two."
5,amazing,"I just bought this CD and it is absolutely fantastic, beautiful clean picking that runs sweet and deep. I've seen both these guys separately in concert, and this cd represents the combination of two absolute geniuses as my imagination can hardly touch. It is heaven listening to these songs."
4,Simple but Helpful,"A little simple and straightforward, but if you are looking for some super-practical ways to grow your marriage - this is it.Also working well to read in sections with a group."
2,Not impressive,"Love the Parrots, but not my favorite of their books. Seemed a little too much aimed at getting a babysitter and I just can't afford babysitters all the time. While good info in some chapters, over all I would have liked not to have purchased it."
5,HAPPY TO KNOW THAT CONSOLES STILL EXIST,"Was very happy to see that a console can still be purchased. I tried alot of stores but, I was told they were discontinued so, I tried the internet and Amazon.com had what, I was looking for the cabinet and the brand Zenith and the price was right too. I love it and am very happy. My TV was 23 years old Zenith it lasted a very long time Zenith is a excellent product thanks Amazon.comHappy in Floral Park, New York"
4,a good retrospective part 2,"I bought this one as a companion to go with the first volume of this collection. Volume 2 contains the B-side ofthe Acorns single ""Your name and mine"".a song called ""Please come back"".One of only Two singles they released on the Unart label. I happen to be lucky enough to own the other one. I know that both volumes of this collection willserve me well in the future."
1,poor plot -hard to follow-a long read,"the plot of a ""book novel"" within this book was confusing. the story line rambled on and on with no real suspense or twists. the only really interesting character was dick dart. it seems like a better book would have been built around this character. outside of dick dart, the book dragged on. it was an effort to read and i would not recommend. this is my second bad straub book. if youre looking for a steven king or dean koontz type author, forget peter straub."
4,HELLFIRE AND KITTEN'S BRITCHES,"Straub, who has written two of my favorite books--""Ghost Story"" and ""Floating Dragon"" is at his top literary form in this book. Although not one of his best, it is a superlative story filled with many twists and unusual characters.No synopsis; it's already out there. A good book, though."
1,Zero Stars,"This is truely one of the worst books I've read. It's very slow, banal, and has no point.Very disappointing after reading great books like Ghost Story, The Throat, and Koko by the same author.Even avid Straub fans will be not want to waste their time reading this one."
1,I haven't read it,"I haven't read this book but judging from the online reviews below, I don't think it's a very good book. I don't think Strab is a very good author either. Try reading some good old fashioned Dene Koonts. He writes some real good books like fear nothing. It is awesome!!!!! Fear nothing is part 1 in a trilogy and it will leave you wanting more and more of chris Snow (the main character that has XP [a rare disease that wont let Chris see the sun!]). Very exciting boook. Sezie the night is the secind novel in the series and the 3rd one hasn't come out just yet! but it will I bet!Oh well, i'm off topic a little! hehe! sorry. Just wanted to say that this book sucks! Please try something else!"
2,Wasn't as scary as advertised,"The advertising I read for this book said it was the scariest book you've ever read. It wasn't scary at all. In fact, it was more of a mystery than it was a horror novel. I was very disappointed. stephen King has nothing to worry about"
2,"Hated it, couldn't get into it, needlessly complex","Peter Straub is at his best when writing with another author, I assume because the other authors are able to cut through some of his verbosity. The man just doesn't know when to stop piling on the details, until the reader is drowning in a sea of unnecessary information written in an extremely turgid style. I frankly don't understand this writer's appeal"
2,Audio version edits this book to ribbons,"I was very frustrated by the audio edition of this book. Side One of the first tape is so choppy, and the characters so bizarre and inexplicable, that it is almost impossible to follow. The protagonists make strange choices; people jump to weird conclusions without justification; and finally, the big finish of the story requires several ridiculously convenient coincidences. From the title, I was expecting a unique story about some sort of cabal or evil society, and instead I found myself listening to a mundane serial killer caper, roughly equivalent to your typical woman-in-jeopardy TV movie of the week. Finally, I borrowed a copy of the paperback, and realized that the novel -- while far from perfect -- filled in all the crucial missing pieces from the audio. The audio story, it turns out, has been so severely edited that it is nearly incomprehensible. Bottom line: if you think the synopsis sounds interesting, try the book, NOT the audio tape."
5,Honest Mistake,"I recently gave them a 1 star, but have found out it was an honest mistake. Amending my rating to 5 for their support."
2,Read it just to get it over with.,"Unlike ""Ghost Story"", which I have cherished and gave me horrible goosebumps, this one fizzles as the plot uncovers a long-ago scandal in a publishing company which may inevitably put it in shambles. It took me more than 2 weeks to finish reading this, as I found it hard to empathize with the characters and the ""novel within the novel"". Somehow the pace did not flow smoothly; though the complex elements of the plot were laid clearly. The devious Dick Dart also appears detached from the general scheme of things. In any case, Straub was able to piece it all out together in the end, a small satisfaction after going through all the trouble."
3,Still not sure what to think,"After waiting through the first two hundred pages, the book got great! Before that, I kept putting it off. But even as it ended, I don't know if I liked it or not. I felt deeply sorry for Nora and the rape sequences and such. I almost cried when he did those things to her. I only wish it had started differently. It was slow and it is hard to keep interest, but trust me, it does get better!"
2,Disappointing,"This book needed serious editing. Tedious details and repetition made for slow going through most of the story. The ending wrapped up the mystery in a tidy fashion, but didn't seem worth the trouble of wading through the whole story. I enjoyed reading Shadowland, Koko, and Ghost Story. I was expecting more from this book and I was disappointed."
3,Good or Bad?,"This is my third Straub book, the first was Shadowland. I must say that this one is written better technically but I enjoyed the plot of Shadowland much better because it was so unique. The Hellfire Club, however, had classic Steven King elements along with the classic Straub flare. A King fan could see the vilian Dart coming a mile away. As regards the style of the book, Straub is one of the most confusing writers that I have ever read (barring Hawthorne of course) because there are times when you just don't understand why he says what he says or what he means. However, the book did have its flashes of genius. The plot was varied and unexpected which was refreshing. The weaving in of the book Night Journey into the plot was inventive. But Straub dashes his genius with an over-the-top writing style that can get a little tedious to get through. While he seems to be getting better as an author he needs a good editor to tell him how to clean a novel up."
5,"complex, twisting tale of murder","I didn't know what to expect after reading KOKO and hating it! I'm addicted to Straub now. Hellfire Club made me root for one of the strongest and most complex heroines I've seen in a long time. I went back to the prolouge of this book about 15 times, trying to figure out how it all tied together. The book within the book, the story of Pippin,at the beginning of each chapter is also worth re-reading. Hellfire Club is an intelligent book, something I'm not used to when reading mystery books, always figuring out the plot half-way through it...I hate that! I'm on MYSTERY now, and can't put it down, again Straub putting over-drive thought into the characters, and the plot."
2,I tried to care . . .,"Straub has written some fine, atmospheric thrillers. This one was tough to like. The villain is over-the-top evil. The heroine maddeningly endures the indignities of her nasty in-laws and her spineless husband. It was a relief for her to be kidnapped. And the Hellfire Club? Didn't seem to have much to do with anything.Every fine writer is entitled to lay an egg now and then. I hope this one never hatches and reproduces."
1,DON'T BUY THIS!,"Don't waste your money! A design flaw makes this kit virtually unusable. Half of the exercises require that you thread the plastic clips (attached to the bands) through metal D-rings (attached to the ankle straps). Unfortunately, the clips are too large to go through the D-rings, so the ankle straps can't be used."
4,Not just a gimmick,"The whole idea sounded kind of gimmicky, but I bought it because I'm a Tony Rice fan who had become intrigued with the mandolin. I guess I expected that I'd listen to it once and then it would disappear into the dust-gathering depths of my CD collection. Even after the first listen I sort of still felt that way. But I've been going back to it more and more. This is beautiful music. The more I listen to this CD the more I like it. My favorites tunes here are Wildwood Flower (you'll want to take up the mandolin after listening to that one), Turn of the Century, Dawg After Dark, and Morning Sun.I noticed a few other reviewers complaining that Tony and Dawg don't reer back let er rip on this disc. I'm not sure what they mean, unless they're complaining that the music is played at less than furious tempos. If so, this seems a silly criticism. There's certainly some improvising going on, though the solos aren't long. But the emphasis is on musicality rather than raw speed."
5,MUST GET THIS CD!!,"If you're a Distillers fan then this cd will definatly apeal to you greatly! If you havent heard their former album Sing Sing Death house and you want to get into the Distillers, then i suggest you get this cd, 'cause its excellent!!!!Brody's (singer) voice sounds great in this cd and the variety of song types is great.I definatly would suggest picking up this cd whether you are already a fan or want to be get this cd!!"
5,So glad music can still be this good.,"This is the Distiller's best and most polished album. Some may think that most polished means it couldn't be the best, but these kids have held on tight to their punk aesthetic and the thing just simply kicks ass. No, this is not revolutionary or different, it's just simply a classic genre done as well as you could do it.If you like the Distillers, check out The Gits. Mia and Brody and Courtney were probably cousins or something. Eerie."
4,Punkers? Not really.,"Don't get me wrong -- the only thing that kept this album from five stars was the last track. But as a long-time punker, I can't call this true punk; raw, exciting, and very well-done -- that I can call Coral Fang.I mean, come on: these guys use more than three chords in practically every song and have layered harmonies arranged in several. There's no doubt that Brody is a stud, that there's a lot of energy in the band's performance, and that as a scrape-your-knuckles-and-hurt-your-throat album it is very effective. But you can also sing to it, and the lyrics aren't meaningless anti-establishment hacking.All in all, a fabulous album -- a surprisingly good listen, and one I'm still not tired of after many, many times through the headphones. Sure to be in the playlist a long time."
3,Is it worth it all?,"Although Brody Armstr... I mean Brody Dalle is my hero, I was some what disapointed with this cd. In an age when any REAL punk cd has over 15 songs, this cd has 12, 12 REALLY short songs. About 1/3 of the songs are REALLy good. The rest are just ok or blah. The last song death sex sounds more like a metal song than a punk. I think I listened to the cd thoroughly 4 times when I first got it and haven't touched it since. I ended up listening to the distiller's 1st s/t album instead. When there was three girls that kicked butt. Like I always say, the oldest cd is the best! My suggestion is to buy this cd when it is on sale, I mean REALLY on sale! or burn it from a friend. This isn't worth the 20 bucks they are asking for now days. Maybe Brody was better of with Tim and on Hellcat alone. Maybe?"
5,They've come a long way.,"Despite many publicised personal conflicts and excessive negative publicity (mostly due to their signing of a major label), The Distillers have grabbed their music by the horns and steered it in a more poignant, expressive direction. The Distillers have done it again, but this time bigger and better.This fourteen track album has the same Distillers edge with a whole new sound. Coral Fang is full of creative drum beats, awesome bass lines, beautifully distorted guitar riffs, and Brody's still snarling voice; not to mention her beautiful lyrics. I believe that Coral Fang is their most moving album yet.The Distillers have come a long way, but they won't stop here.Women are the future of rock and roll."
1,Horrible horrible horrible!!,"Some people say they are better than Evanesence uh i think not. Some people say the lead singer is hot uh with those big lips i think not. Some people say the Distillers are punk uh i think not. Some people say the Distillers suck uh i think SO! The cover is very stupid and the lyrics are very stupid. The sound of this girl is very irritating to me. I would rather listen to some one takin a piss than listen to this ""girl"" moan about death. Plus she thinks shes punk becuz she always goes woah woah woah! Instead buy AFIs Black Sails in Sunset and see the light!!"
4,Brodys back,"This is the newest offering from The Distillers, and if your wondering why I've given it 5 stars and not any lower, is because I dont like to lie...this album is both musical and poetic genius combined. Sure any old band can right about death and love, but only The Distilllers, or more accurately Brodys gravelled throat, Ryans pounding bass lines, Tonys screeching guitar and Andys beats sustain the albums quality all the way through. Quite simply, buy it. Now. .."
2,"courtney love, is that you?","well, i remember back in the day, taking a trip to seattle and picking up a hole album along the way...and courtney love - aaahhh f****ed up courtney...bless her soul, she disturbed a little piece of my soul w/ her shredded voice....soooo, my opinion is that brody does a great IMPERSONATION of coutney! she is almost better than the real thing! yes, yes...w/ those PERFECT teeth in her so-called punk, courtney copy mouth.oh people of new faith...what happened to the old days of punks so skinny they were like street dogs and teeth that looked like they had chewed on glass? since when did punk get so pretty?i seriously hope brody gives credit where (courtney)credit is due."
2,coral fang by the distillers,"Enjoyed the music, but this cd was supposed to be brand new and it wasn't.The cd was missing the plastic wrap and the hard plastic was cracked."
3,TRUE PUNK,"This is a true punk band. Female singer (Brody) plays guitar and wrote all the material on the CD. What an incredible voice!!! Her voice is unforgettable. At first I thought it was a man singing. I'm glad I have this CD in my collection if only to be able to listen to Brody's vocals.The CD is fast paced with one song hitting after another. When I first listened to it, it felt like my ears were getting assaulted because the guitars were so relentless. But then, that's what punk is. The songs are loud, aggressive and -- relentless.If you're not into punk, you won't like this CD. If you are, buy this CD. You will be very pleased."
5,5 Stars,"This CD holds all of the ENERGY of The Distillers with a minor tweaking of the heart. It takes a couple of listenings for it to get a hold of you but it really does get a hold of you. I like how they changed things up and added more diversity to the music. I wish I had that intense energy, the growl from hell (envy, envy), and what, melodies? - awesome. Screw all these magazine reviewers who want to put them in a box - and the kids who lack the ability to make up their own minds and believe there is actually something that exists called pure punk. Screw genres, people should be free to create whatever they want. And let people speculate on their own about what they think the lyrics are really about. I hope The Distillers keep doing whatever the hell they want to do and making the music they want to make. Don't listen to the BS. One con: the only song I don't like is Deathsex which just drones on with half-ass music. Still 5 Stars baby."
4,Absolutely Awesome!,"I love this album. Sure, I must admit it is different to their previous stuff but progress is not a dirty word. Brody has such a powerful voice and Andy, Ryan and Tony are great musicians. This is such a good album for punk fans."
3,The Distillers go to the sing sing death house,"Well, if that is a death house of semi-generic punk. I own Sing sing death house & if you expected more of that and there self titled, I'm sorry, Its not all there. This has less speed, less fierocity, & frankly less punk in it. The distillers (in my humble opinion)could have been to women in street punk what Punk was to music. But, I should tell you why ths is worth your hard erned pesos, Brody & the crew haven't lost there edge, songs like ""Beat your heart Out"" & ""Hunger"" Still echo street punk & hardcore and are my favs on this album. Brody, please go back to what ever it was that made ""Death house"" so great, and grow another mohawk-its cool."
1,Big money for Brody?,"I'd like to blame the switch from Epitaph to Warner Brothers for this travesty of an album.Don't get me wrong, I had the distinct pleasure of talking to Brody after a couple of shows a while back. The fact that she comes out and talks to those fans desperate or drunk enough to hang around impressed me quite a bit. She's really very cool, and their first two albums are phenomenal. Which makes it that much harder to understand why she made the switch from raw, gritty, real music to this monotonous, radio-worthy drivel. If you are a big fan of Blink 182 or Green Day, this is probably a good album for you."
2,Coral Fang,"The only worse thing than bad music is when an AMAZING band like the Distillers sells out.The Distillers WERE a raw energetic hard edged no gimics punk band that I could actually appreciate, but now they are mearly going into the maintream jungle of same sounding bands.VERY dissapointing for anyone expecting an album like ""sing sing deathhouse"" or thier self titled album.I only give it 2 stars out of pity"
2,Washed Up,"With their their first album being absolute kick-a$$ and the second, Sing Sing Death House flat out rocks, this was a mediocre follow up. The Distillers lost their edge on this one. It was very disappointing to hear such uninspired songs coming from such a promising band. I don't really recommend this album unless you are trying to round out your collection."
5,Distillers,The Distillers new CD Coral Fang is an awesome CD that everyone should go out and buy. Their music is great no matter what label they are on.Their sound is as strong as every with Brody singing her heart out. This CD is all I've been listening to and I strongly suggest that you go out and get too.
3,Short but to the point,"As typical with high paced punk music, this is a short CD. The last song is okay for about 5 minutes then becomes annoying. Overall, a very solid effort from this band but I still prefer Sing Song Death House."
5,thumbs up from the distilla nation,"someone mentioned drain the blood being the only decent song on the album. i thought that at first, then i spent some time listening to the whole album a few times and realised that drain the blood is probably the worst song on the album, and it's still good. brody seems to have ditched some of her anger, and at first i didn't approve, but this new improved more mature brody definitely beats the other one. i've never heard the distillers sound this good, and they sounded even better live last year. all the songs on coral fang completely blew me away, but i'd say the best ones are the gallow is god, coral fang, the hunger and hall of mirrors, which all conveniently follow each other. the beginning few minutes of deathsex are amazing and are there as a reminder that brody still has that raw discharge-inspired punk rock anger. if such a term exists."
3,It'll do,"Most people worshiping this album don't seem to have any real concept of the first two, which is disappointing. I have nothing new to add except to register that I am on the side of this being a disappointment after their self titled and sing sing records. They were kick ass, this sounds like a cross between Veruca Salt's Resolver and an unreleased mediocre Hole album. Expect little."
5,really nice!,"I just seen the Distillers live last FRiday, and the new stuff is awesome! Buy this record!"
5,Review on The Distillers - Coral Fang,"The cd coral fang exspresses its ways and feelings like no other cd befor. The lead singer brody dalle has a classic rock voice that will just blow you away! Theres only one thing left to say rather than its apsulutly fantastic, get out there and buy the cd and try it for yourself!"
5,GOOD!,"Okay overral each song has its own catchy thing in it, and they are all great altogether.Drain the blood - 5/5Dismantle me - 5/5Die on a rope - 4/5The Gallon is God - 5/5Coral Fang - 5/5The Hunger - 5/5 -best songHall of Mirrors - 5/5Beat Your Heart Out - 3.5/5Love Is Paranoid - 4/5For tonight your only here to know - 4/5Death Sex - 1/5 - what (...)is this...lolBuy it. Now."
5,"There is hope for modern punk yet,, at least i HOPE....","During my senior year of high school I noticed a lot of kids in school wearing Distillers hoodies- I just assumed they were some other new ""pop-punk"" band.. I went online and found out more about them and learned that they are real punk,, and that they have a chick singer.. I decided to give them a listen just for curiousity- WOW, they're really good! I really like the song ""Drain the Blood"", and stuff from ""Sing Sing Death House""- Brody has a really good voice and she writes really good lyrics, and isn't too bad looking either :)Check them out if you like good real punk"
5,"Buy it, its great!",I bought this CD on the day it came out at the Jimmy Kimmel show. They are as good as it can get. Not only is the CD great but the live performances are awesome. This CD includes hard punk aswell as soft songs.
5,The distillers,"I bought this Cd the day it came out and it hasn't left my car stereo since. Let me warn you..it's not like the self-titled Cd or ""Sing sing death house"". The lyrics are very well written and the music is just incredible. I've been a Hole fan since the beginning and to me...""Coral Fang"" is like Hole celebrity Skin cd...a departure from the older Cd but it still very very good. If your one of those people that have been hearing about the distillers and haven't check them out...you should buy this Cd...it's not as hard as the older ones...so if you're looking a faster and louder Cd I'd go for the older ones."
4,THE DISTILLERS!,"I think that this CD is pretty well done. The single ""Drain The Blood"" is definatly more poppy then old Distillers. I definatly like the old Distillers alot better but this cd has shown alot of growth and maturity in there music. Brody is also extremly hot."
5,Coral Fang,"This cd is abit different from their previous stuff. the band has obviously grown since their debut self titled. Brody Dalle has improved as a songwriter and a singer. It has a mixture of songs, coral fang fast and the hunger slower. all the tracks compliment eachother in some way, with so many different emotions in the songs."
4,better than expected,"Wasnt sure exactly how i was going to like the cd. But when I first listened to it, it quickly became a favorite. I need to go out and get the rest of their cd's now."
3,Disappointing,"Not nearly as good as Sing Sing Death House, which was an album where the Distillers really discovered what they do best. The two songs I ended up liking from Coral Fang were the ones that sounded like they could have been from SSDH. Too much experimentation. Don't mess with something that's working! I was disappointed by this release, and much prefer their older stuff."
3,It's not punk but I like it,"I want to make it clear- Coral Fang is NOT punk rock. It does not have the primative, raw, grab you by the ears and balls edge that either of The Distillers previous releases have had. However, it is bloody good!Brody has grown up, and pushed her music more into the mainstream. It is a refreshing change to hear her broken-glass howl in the charts, and it is blacked up beautifully by some new members of the band.The diverse range of songs on the album, ranging from the murderous 'death sex' (a nod to the Distillers of old) to the new radio-friendly 'Drain the blood', means you won't get bored listening to this record. It unfolds before you like a story book of the last eventful year Brody has been through.Whereas Rancid's Indestructable was nothing short of life-affirming, Brody seems to be the one bleeding in the gutter. So sit back, relax, and outstretch your shoulder. With this record, it feels like the desperate rant of an old friend."
2,What the heck is this crap?,"Brody, dear, dear Brody, WHAT HAPPENED?!?! I understand that you're probably pretty upset about your divorce from Tim, but that doesn't give you a right to disappoint your fans with this crap you call music.I recieved this cd for Christmas, and let me say, I'm glad I didn't pay for it. I listened to it once and was absolutely disgusted. The music has lost the feeling it once held. Don't get me wrong, it does still hold some emotion in it, but not the wonderful hardcore-pissed-off-I-hate-you vibe. In short, Brody is going soft.My advice to Brody is this: Take all that anger (come on, we all know it's in there!) over your divorce from Tim, and use it! Otherwise, you can say goodbye to your fans and hello to the dreaded emo scene (*Shudder*).My advice to you, the consumer: Stick to old Distillers albums, when Brody was actually pretty ****ing awesome."
5,Coral Fang,i'll keep it short - Coral Fang in my opinion is THE best rock album in the history of this planet!! (im 31 yrs old) BUY IT! BUY IT NOW! i swear u wont regret it!
3,Bleached Coral,"It's like Nirvana's Bleach- but with Cobain's wife singing it. I'm not saying this is bad, its just creepy."
1,Blah,From all the reviews i thought this would be a great CD. the only song i liked was the one that plays on the radio. Maybe i will have to give it some time and let it grow on me...i would not suggest buying it ... just listen to the radio ....
1,Bad Enough,"The other pendragon books were brillant. But, this just didn't have the touch. It tried and boy could you tell. the author just couldn't make the right things happen at the right time. If you are looking for a great book get the harry potter series there perfect! I hope you all have fun reading what your reading!"
4,"Very, very good","This was a wonderful chapter in Bobby Pendragon's adventure. However, I found it rather long. I also found it had slow parts, but climaxed in a fantastic story line. Saint Dane's plan on the territory of Quillan is amazingly unique and sinister. I found this as a very very good book. A definite read."
3,Slowing down,"Read all the books in this series. Booked and got this from my library, read it and returned it. Not as good as earlier books. That's it for this series. I may not read anymore. The author is now stuck in a rut"
2,Disappointing Effort,"The Pendragon series involves action, adventure, and a tired derivative formula. O wow here's a brand new territory with problems only Bobby can tackle. don't think you are going to get new information Reader, don't think that at all. after all there are still 3 more books. This formula is getting tiring. Machale seems to not be able to move beyond this or have his characters continue their growth. All the characters have returned to their original cardboard stereotypical traits. Do all the characters have to be opposites?Machale's writing and characters need to grow up though I do admit the man can sure weave a tale!"
3,Cover,"First off when i saw this book it had the original cover when the books first came out and that is why i purchased it. However when it came in the mail, the cover was different and i am not happy about it. I wanted all of the covers to be the same and instead i have one that i didn't want."
3,Just all right,"The main reason I was interested in this strategy guide was for hints on beating the Mini-Camp challenges. The guide was not helpful at all in this respect, the tips for the challenges are a mere sentence or two. Very disappointing.As far as the rest of the book goes, a lot of it seems to be extraneous material meant to take up space, such as a list of all the Madden cards, a list of every player in the game, a section with one person's walkthrough of the fantasy draft, etc. This was interesting from a certain perspective, but ultimately not too helpful in actually playing the game.The thing I liked most was the tips on rushing plays. The guide does give some good advice on when to juke, spin, stiff-arm, etc. Outside of this information, I thought this strategy guide was nothing special. A couple of pages on each team and some eye candy (in the form of unhelpful screenshots), and that's about it."
1,Terrible,"Don't waste your money. There is about 5-pages of this book that are of value regharding relative strengths and weaknesses of defensive formations. Other than that, it is like an instruction manual with larger type and pretty pictures. The publishers should be ashamed of theselves calling this a ""strategy guide"" it is nothing of the sort."
4,The Best Film About Kansas Since The Wizard of Oz,"Crispin Glover fans will be in hog heaven when they see this neglected classic. He chews up the scenery, spits it out, and chews it up all over again. He wears leather jackboots, cracks a whip, and plays echoplex guitar-drenched love songs that don't seem to go anywhere. He also sings a great song called ""Daddy Was So Mean"". His delivery is so delicate that every line spoken trembles with sensitivity.Watch out for the million-dollar cameo from Bull Lee, author of ""Junky""."
2,Meager!,"Not even a serious try to cope with a suitable description(IPA standards)of the pronounciation of Modern Irish, not even of the standard variant, which is the most difficult part of the system concerned to be mastered by foreigners who don't have daily access to the spoken language."
4,Good TV for Small Space,"I've had this TV for 10 years without a problem. The VCR plays just as well today as it did when I bought it, and the sound and picture are pretty good considering the cheap price. I highly recommend it for when you're on a budget or need a small tv for the bedroom."
4,You'll WON'T GET BORED WITH THIS ONE !,"Great recording by this British band from the 80's, which recorded only 3 albuns before vanishing. THis two featured here are the best of them, ""See you in Hell"" the best of the three. It has that typical tone of metal guitars, it makes you enjoy each song, it is fantastic. Too bad the band lasted so few."
5,totally underrated band!!!,"Sickly underrated band, Awesome music two great releases on one disc. Please bring on a fourth!!! REUNION!"
5,This blows the roof off!,"Finally, some classic heavy metal from the 1980's. Allthough this band's lead singer (deemed by Beavis and Butt-Head ""a fat pig"") maybe a little chubby around the edges, he is by far the most valuable asset to rock music since the invention of the pignose amp. His bloodcurling screams on hits scuch as ""The Final Scream"" are enough to send any old lady to the madhouse. Aside from that, steady bass lines, wicked drum lines, an a guitarist that sounds like Eric Clapton's evil twin brother. To top that, the band's lyrics are so scary, that nightmares may arise from their spooky devil-worshipping content! And of course, their masterpeice title cut, ""See You In Hell"" is a satanic grind-core anthem that any serious metal fan knows by heart. Little known fact: In the song's final chorus, the lead singer belts out the words ""See you in hell!"" one additional time in an octave so high, only canines may enjoy it!"
3,UNFULFILLED incomplete product / missing parts,I received my pack without the cover for airline travel. Be sure to specify that you want all the parts as advertised. Otherwise a great pack for a good price.
2,A tough hike,Terrible pack if you are carrying very much weight at all. Buckles on adjustment straps slip constantly. Always having to stop and readjust. Terrible...terrible. Originally tried this pack on at the local sporting goods store. Seemed to be a quality pack. Durable and it fit well. Boy was I wrong. If the adjustments you make don't stay in place you might as well be carrying a regular suitcase on your hike.
5,GREAT BACK PACK FOR AN AWESOME PRICE,paid [...] bucks and in exchange got this awesome super high quality hiking pack. was a little bit smaller than i expected but not a problem... this will carry all i need for a 1-3 day trip... the sleeping bag compartment at the bottom is the perfect size for my suisse sport mummy bag that i also bought off amazon for a GREAT price... lots of straps and ways to lash stuff on to the pack if needed and over all just a great pack for the money
3,Decent pack,"This is a decent pack, albeit small. Really not suitable for anything more than a leisurely 2-day trip, or so."
3,For a Small Frame person only,"I got the pack because it's cheap and looked like it would suit my purposes. When I got it the label says that it is for torso height of 15""-19"" which is most women and medium built guys. This information is not on the website and it really should be. I went to a local store and got measured at 21"" torso height and immediately sent the pack back. If you are within the 15""-19"" torso height then I would recommend it saying that it looks like a good bargain."
3,high sierra summit 45,"This bag is a great summer overnight packing bag. Not good for colder winter or extended trips. It has very little packing room. The sleeping bag pouch on the bottom is too small for a regular bag, but fits a fleece bag and a camp pillow. The center front zip pocket is useless when the main compartment is packed full. The rain cover is great. The bag is lightweight and very comfy for any size person just about. My small framed 110 lb friend was very comfy in it as was I at 190 lbs. Just not enough room for a long trip. Overall great features, well made quality bag but small."
2,Dazed and Confused,"I really like the overall audio quality of the product, but the problem is the quantity. Someone here said that you can fit in more music on the pocket CD than a real CD? Please tell me how because I can't figure it out. THe most I can fit in per CD is about 24 minutes worth of songs. Which end sup being about 4 songs. How do you guys copy full albums per these little pocket cd's? Someone said they put in about 45 songs? HOW? that would be about 20 of these little cd's wouldn't it? How did you fit it in on one? Someone please tell me. My email is Legendv&@aol.com. I keep calling cutomer service but nobody there knows anything about this product."
1,Faulty display,"I purchased this item at the end of April 2003. Everything was fine. I used it only a few times, then it sat for a few months untouched. Then in November 2003 when I went to use it again, there was absolutely no display. Swapping out batteries made no difference. I went to the Memorex website... they don't even list it. I don't have a clue as to why the display went out. It plays, but without a display it's next to useless. Of course now that more than 30 days have elapsed I'm stuck with it. $60 wasted. Don't buy this item."
1,Display stopped working after a few weeks,"While it worked, the player was ok. It's quite a bit bigger than you'd expect, because they use the guts of a regular sized CD player, so the unit itself is quite a bit bigger than the Mini-CDs that it plays. However, after only a few weeks of light use, the display went flakey and has now completely stopped showing anything. It's so sad when a company throws what little reputation it had left into such a shoddy product. I'll NEVER buy anything with Memorex' name on it ever again."
2,Display won't work,"I got one, display didn't work right out of the box. Sent it back for another...display worked for about two weeks then went out. The idea behind this product is great, but without the display its just too hard to navigate the files. I'd reccomend buying a different brand because there is obviously a flaw in this one."
4,"Teac mini cd bad, Memorex mini cd good.","Bought a Teac mini cd player, was a battery hog and after a short while it worked less and less. Sent it back (after some hassles) and got a new one. Same problems, now it lies in some land fill.Memorex mini cd player has been used for about 4 months now. Great life with rechargeable batteries and has not given me any problems. I work as a handy man and music makes the work more enjoyable. Dust and minor abuse have not stopped it.Only problems. The player normally sits in a wallet sized hip pack and from time to time the pause button gets hit or the volume level changes contact with stuff. A hold switch would fix that problem.I bought a second unit as a reserve because I liked the first one I bought so much. I guess I thought by now the first one would have broken. The new unit sits on a shelf, an investment for the future.I bought 2, go buy one."
2,LCD problems make this a bad buy.,"The lcd which is a very vital element in knowing what is being played for MP3 cds stopped working after a month. I was very disappointed as this was a gift for my dad.The battery compartment lid is very tight and I think that is one of the reasons the lcd stopped working as some connection may have gotten loose inside because of the pressure needed to open the battery compartment.The sound quality of the headphones is not good. Used a sony headphone instead and the sound was great. So no complaints about the sound quality here. If the LCD worked, this player would have been a good buy.I bought a Philips Expanium 431 instead. Not only is it smaller than this player and the lcd works great too."
2,It's time is over,"I've had one of these for a little under two years and when I had it I rarely used it. It holds so little music per mini-CD that I just kept burning the much cheaper full sized CDs. Now, I have a flash based player.If you're really considering this. Don't. Look at one of the cheaper flash players. The mini-CDs only hold 212 (if I remember correctly) and you can get a Sandisk DAP 256 for around $50 now (Sept 05).However, for a collector of odd gadgets and obsolete tech, sure, this is an interesting anomoly."
1,Do Not Buy It,"First item does not work with all mini-discs, I burned about 15 and only worked with 3 and sometimes.Second Display worked only for one month.Third .. Headphones did not work anymore.So, nothing works at all.I also buy another mp3 player and all of the 15 mini-discs worked with this new mp3-player.Sorry about my english."
2,Memerox MP3/ Mini CD Player,"I opened up the package, put in a disc (which I had made prior) and played it. The sound was fine, But the display didnt function at all. Now I have to send it back, will not buy again from memorex!"
3,Defective Screen,"I was looking at several mini-cd players and this was the only one that displayed file names, and was the cheapest one too. But, you get what you pay for; first off the unit is a little bulky (trust me, it wont fit in everyones pants), second the headphones are worthless, uncomfortable and lousy sound quality, third A Click IS heard at the end of every song which IS annoying for audiophiles like me, Fourth and most important, the display isnt backlight AND IT ONLY WORKED FOR 2 days.With good headphones the sound is awesome (except for the click), battery life is ok ~8-10 hrs. I returned this one and ordered a second unit (price is just too good).I`ll wait and see what happens."
2,Disappointed,"I got the first one, it worked good except the text display didnt show anything. I could move through folders, listen to any song, but I couldnt see what song I was on or how much time had elapsed. So I send it back for a replacement. Same problem. I am very displeased with the product, but think it would be great if the screen worked."
3,Only about 1-2 cm smaller than a fullsize!,"Here's the problem with these ""mini"" CD players: they use a fullsize CD mechanism! No manufacturer has had the guts to build a dedicated mini-CD reader mechanism, so all the so-called mini-CD products just try to pack the guts of a full size CD reader into a smaller package. The result is something that's only 1-2 cm smaller (in linear dimension) than its full sized brethren. Not too compelling!Having said that, the unit is not bad; it's just not small. There are occasional quirks in the audio between songs (as others have reported) and the unit seems slightly more prone to skipping than other CD players I've used. Continous jostling movement (e.g. jogging) will result in occasional skipping."
1,Display died after a few days,"I got this about a week ago. It worked very nicely for several days. And then, a couple of days ago, I turned it on and the display no longer worked. It worked again for a few hours, and then died again. It is kind of hard to use the device without the display, especially since you can only tell whether you are turning it ON or OFF by the using the display. Oh well, I guess I'll send it back. It sure seemed like a cool idea! I should have paid attention to all the other reviews that mentioned the faulty display, but no, I thought ""I won't have a problem with mine."""
2,Display Failed,"This product should never gone into production with such a poor display component. It took it a couple of days, but the display eventually failed on me, just like it did for other people that've reviewed this player.Aside from that, it's a pretty decent player for the money. Reads MP3's with all kinds of bit-rates and doesn't even complained about damaged files.The interface could be a little simpler though. For example, to skip to next album, you have to press the ""mode"" button twice, then the ""stop"" button.In the end, I redurned it and got a Philips EXP411 instead. Little more expansive, but definately worth it."
1,MINI CD ONLY ! ! !,"The information supplied / advertized does not readily indicate that it only uses mini 3"" CD/s.Not what I want!I want my money back, but I slit the package open before realizing this fact so I may be stuck with it.This does not reflect on audio quality, I have never played it."
1,Noninformative,I am disappointed in this item because it does not state anywhere that it can not play regular cd's.... therefore I have to send this back and pay for shipping once again. I would like a refund for shipping please - only because of the mislead info. on this item.
2,Wrong Product Name,"Be careful. This will not play normal size CD's. For those of us who don't know the size of a regular CD.....you'll be sorry when you get this. You can only play ""little cd's"" on this. It should not be called a CD Player.I don't know how it works if you wanted it...because I had to send it back."
1,Dazzle disappointment,"Dazzle, it's namesake apart - disappoints. The box clearly says that it works with Windows Vista. The software installed with windows warning that there were compatibility issues with Pinnacle Systems software. The patches were installed and Studio 10 and Instant DVD recorder crashed (Windows blue screen)- service is non existant and their online forum and support is of no use. I will be returning this to Amazon.DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT UNTIL DAZZLE CORRECTS ALL OF THESE PROBLEMS."
5,Love it,I have read a lot of negative feedback on Pinnacle products but I have been using their software for years now on multiple PCs and I have no problems with them. I purchased the Dazzle video capture device to transfer my old analog home movies to the PC. The quality was every bit as good as the original and it was easy to use. I literally had zero problems using this device. If your PC is older (like mine) I suggest getting the Dazzle Platinum (silver) over the red one because it has built in decoding hardware. You also have a variety of capture format options.This is by far the best value for someone wanting to archive old home movies.
1,Dazzle -- Junk,"Junk - I bought it to convert old tapes -- couldn't get it to finalize the DCD properly -- got it to work once out of 10 tries (& hours later) -- then took it back. The support for Dazzle is almost non-existent -- website isn't clear, & when I did an email -- the automated reply was to go to the website, status of the support issue was closed. Junk."
1,Doesn't work on Vista,"Even though I was told the product would work on vista,(compusa rep) it doesn't work. I have Vista Home on a new Dell computer. (dual processor, 1 gig ram, video card, etc) I believe that the product is probably great on XP but I can't get it to run on vista as promised.I won't bad mouth the software because I really can't get it to run properly so I wouldn't even know but, I can state that Pinnacle Software support is NOT good and that is what is disappointing to me. Frankly I don't understand how they can't have their product working on Vista right away. I think they had plenty of time to figure out driver issues for Vista. Weird."
1,Pinnacle Products,"People who only want to capture raw footage from a source to a DVD are probably happy with this product. If you have anything with quick cuts or low light or anything already edited that you want to capture you will find that the software pinnacle supplies for ALL of its products is very weak. It takes hours to render, will drop MANY frames and the support is laughable. People who have preconfigured machines like Dell or Gateway or the likes will either like it very much because they're novice's or they'll have problems with the software conflicting with their AOL or other preloaded ""let me help you baby"" software. I would get a better capture device and then buy a seperate software suite. Try demo's online before you buy..."
2,Dazzle video creator,"This does exactly what I wanted to do but I did already have Pinnacle and have worked with it too.I haven't converted all my vhs tapes yet, but I will. It is time consuming."
1,Not compatible with Vista,"I bought this item from Best Buy and the sale rep told me that it would become compatible with Vista after applying some patches available on Pinnacle website. I spent four hours on figuring out which patch to get, downloading, and installing it and it still won't work. It crashes with the blue screen everytime I click on the ""capture"" tab. The patches are in beta stage and Pinnacle does not claim that they will work properly. Still, it is all very annoying."
3,"It records 360 games, but...","If you want to record you XBOX360 play and post it on Youtube this will work, but the creativity is limited. Everytime I want to add an effect there is always an option to purchase an upgrade. Don't let the purchase price fool you because in order to anything special you have to spend a lot more money!"
5,Works great with XP,"This dazzle works great with xp. Its awesome. I record army of two, and it has excellent quality. I recommend this to anyone who has windows xp."
1,Don't Waste Your Money on this Item,"Everything loaded fine. Once I opened the program, it told me that updates were available so I downloaded version 10.7 and the patch (for Internet Explorer 7 users). First installed the patch, then installed update as per instructions. My primary interest was to convert VHS home movies to files and DVD's. It captured the videos OK and I was able to edit the various scenes, but the program hung up every time I tried to make a movie (either to file to DVD). Also the Direct to DVD function hung up too. I spent a week trying to get this thing to work, but in the end it was all in vain. I did check my system and had the required hardware. Unless you're a gambler, don't waste your money on this product. Go with something else that works."
1,Pinnacle won't launch,I have tried unsuccessfully several times to launch the s/w but i keep getting an error msg that the techs can't seem to assist me with.Linda 301-802-3628
1,Worked once - then never again,"It worked once - for a brief session of converting old camcorder videos to DVD - then when I hooked a VCR to the thing (and of course, I couldn't return it) the program ceases to work.It is very disappointing - more so that now I have to spend more money on another product that will hopefully work as advertised."
5,Great product - based on the feature set.,"I used the older version of this - the Dazzle DVC130, which only has hardware encoding for MPEG1 & MPEG2. Great product and as this product comes with MPEG4 & DivX hardware encoding I would recommend this to anyone interested in home video capture. Only one question in my mind - does this encode both for both PAL and NTSC video standards? If so this would be one of the best video capture options around for this price range."
1,Could not get this to work at all,"Just so you don't think I don't have enough horsepower on the computer I am trying to use this on, I have a Intel duo core with 4GB ram and 1TB *thats 1000GB of hard drive space. I could NEVER get the pinnacle studio QS to load, it would always hang during installation (and I let it sit for over an hour to see if it was hung).I also tried on a second computer. it would install, but after 30 minutes of it saying it was capturing, I had nothing captured (even though the preview showed it playing during capture.This is being returned..."
1,Buyer Beware,"I have now logged over 35 hours trying to get this program to work on a Vista computer. Tech support, live chat, countless serial number updates, downloads as large as 1.35 GB, uninstalling, reinstalling and it will not work. I too have a worthless Pinnacle product.If you are thinking of buying this for a Vista computer, save your money!"
3,dazzle video creator platinum,"this may be a good product but it did not work for what we wanted to do. I don't feel it was the product, just our application"
1,Not compatible with Vista! Buy Honestech's Video-to-DVD Deluxe instead!,"This product is not compatible with Vista, even after setting compatibility options to be compatible with Windows XP. I went ahead and returned this item and purchased the Honestech Video-to-DVD software (the Deluxe edition includes the interface box with Video and audio L/R jacks, as well as S-video jack) to connect to the USB 2.0 port. The Honestech Video-to-DVD seems to be a lot easier to use than the Pinnacle Dazzle Video Creator. Save yourself the wasted hours and headache trying to get Pinnacle Dazzle Video Creator to be compatible with Vista, it's not! The Honestech Video-to-DVD actually states on the box: WINDOWS VISTA READY! I will purchase Honestech's Video-to-DVD Deluxe instead, since obviously they're keeping up with Microsoft and the ever-changing Windows editions! Thanks, Honestech! You're a company that truly cares about the consumer, as evidenced by your making this available for Vista so soon."
1,Completely useless!,This program wasted so much of my time and energy. The only thing I managed to do was copy from VHS to my hard disk. I cannot copy to DVD. It constantly crashes and freezes. Updates were made to the software with no results. A complete waste of money and time. Save yourself the headache and steer clear of this one.
1,Does not work with Vista,Believe the other reviews. This product absolutely and positively does not work with Windows Vista. Even with all of the latest patches from Pinnacle it crashes to a bluescreen every time.
2,Dazzle Platinum - Mini DV tapes to DVD,"I have had this product for a month. Set up on my computer and capturing videos from my mini DV camcorder was quite easy using a firewire connection. I am using Windows XP Pro with 2 GB Memory. Editing the movie and adding subtitles was easy but adding music and the more advanced functions were more difficult. Making the movie and burning to a DVD disc was erratic. It would work fine for 20 to 30 minutes into the operation and burning to the DVD disc would then freeze while the making movie part would continue. Once this happens, the DVD drive had difficulty opening and you have to restart your computer to open it and restart the make movie and burn process on a new disc. Eventually it worked. On playback to TV, occassionally the picture would freeze for a second to 20 seconds before it proceed. Most annoying."
4,Great for quick capture,"Well, this is good for if you want to begin youtube videos or machinimas(videos of a video game captured from a recording device such as a dazzle pinnicale for mac or a capture card)if your gonna get for that and you have seen the videos on youtube on how to set it up then GET IT!!!!!!!!!!"
1,It is totally useless!,"I bought this unit last December from another big online site when it was on sale. I did not install this unit until a week ago when I tried to convert my old tape to DVD. It did not work at all on my desktop. I went on to the Pinnacle support site for help and went through the FAQ, however all efforts were in vain. Then I tried to install on my new laptop, unfortunately it does not work on vista. so I end up with a useless Dazzle Video Creator Platinum (DVC170 and software)"
4,Dazzle Platinum,"I found this product very easy to install and use. I have not played with the Studio software yet ... but my intent was not to do fancy editing but rather capture video streams and get them to a DVD. The instant DVD recorder does a wonderful job of this with little effort. A really nice feature of the instant recorder is the ability to automatically generate chapters at any interval (example: .. every 10 minutes ... etc.). The final product has a very professional look on the opening title page.; however, you can't expect to get the full clarity of a professionally created DVD if the ""GOOD"" record quality is selected. ""GOOD"" allows 133 minutes of record time on a single layer DVD ... ""BETTER""=109 minutes ""BEST""=93 minutes... I highly recommend this product"
4,MX-800 purchased from Amazon no longer usable,"s of August 1, Universal Remote Control products have become unusable unless purchased from an authorized dealer -- which Amazon.com is not.Universal Remote Control has removed the software needed to use the remote from the box. They have also removed the software from their web site. URC has said that only customers who purchase at list price from an authorized dealer will be given access to the software. Without this software, the customer has no way to update their remote or program it.Announcement from URC on this issue is here:http://www.remotecentral.com/wn060801.htmThis is a nice remote, but if you want it, make sure you purchase from an authorized dealer that can give you access to the software needed to program it.

1,DVD793CH No Disc Error,"I used this player three times since Feb, 2003. Now I get a no disc error and Philips won't stand behind it. All they will do for me is exchange it for a $60.00 fee."
1,DO NOT BUY PHILIPS - WILL NOT STAND BEHIND THEIR PRODUCTS,"My Philips DVD793CH 5 Disc DVD Player stopped working within a year after I had purchased it. Comes up with a ""NO DISC"" error and refuses to play discs. Only live customer service personnel you can talk to is a service center in Jamaica - very rude and arrogant !!! No response to letters written to a Philips PO Box address in Miami FL. Used to think Philips was a good company - don't think so anymore. I will NEVER ever buy a PHILIPS product again."
1,Poorly constructed,"There is apparently a problem with the Philips DVD-793 and the optical disk rotation motor wearing out. The motor eventually wears out and doesn't have enough torque to overcome the initial static friction and start spinning the disc. The player kicks the disk out and displays a ""Disc Error"" message when in fact it is the player mechanism malfunctioning. Sometimes you can overcome this by using a ""Fonzie"" and giving the machine a light tap as it's loading.Mine, (a DVD793CH21) lasted about 3 years, so I suppose I am lucky considering the reviews where people got less than a year of service. It's not feasible or cost effective to attempt to repair the part, so I guess I'll be buying something else. Probably not branded ""Philips"""
5,Don't stop at number 11,"If you've not heard this album...buy it! Ghost machine says ""You've never heard anything like this before"" They couldnt be more correct. In case you're unaware, there are 79 total tracks on the album. Most just mumbling and twisted sound, but just keept it playing...you'll see which ones are full length......keep it going....I'm serious!Follower of the Machine"
2,NOT IVAN'S BEST WORK...,"I have been listening to MOTOGRATER for years and always wondered if I would ever hear from Ivan Moody again. Pound for pound,one of the best vocalists out there. SORRY GUYS,not this time. This CD is very strange and never seems to go anywhere. Lots of noises to take up space instead of just playing music. If you are a big fan of MOTOGRATER like I am ,this is a let down. If you want to see Ivan in prime form, buy FIVE FINGER DEATH PUNCH and you will see what I mean."
5,"If you want to learn to make molds/casts, get this","As the title says. If you want to learn how to make your own molds and castings, get this. All you need to add are some disposable plastic cups and stirring sticks, and you are on your way! The level of detail the silicone mold picks up is amazing. If you can see it on the original, you'll see it on the cast, even if you can't feel it -the detail is that accurate!"
5,Great kit to learn how to make a mold,Smooth-On is makes awesome stuff. I used this kit to make a mold of an Asssassin's Creed logo that I carved from foam. Follow the instructions and it will work perfectly. That is all.Protip: get a container to pour your mold in that fits your project so you don't waste this stuff. It isn't cheap.
4,Great for girls too!,"This is a great DVD for our collection and while geared toward boys my daughter enjoys the episodes just as well. The two episodes from Thomas & Friends help to teach about pride and when to ask for help as well as when to give it. Two episodes from Fireman Sam are great for learning about the life of a fireman as well as safety! Then finishing up with two episodes of Bob the Builder teaches about big responsibilities and how eve big diggers (or older folks) sometimes get lonely just like little ones. Then also to be slow and cautious, because fast is not always best and efficient. Every episode comes back to friendship and teamwork in a wonderful way. Through out many lessons of value for your little one to learn while being entertained and giving this preschoolers mama just a minute.At this time you can also find it on digital download and on demand, so whatever you preference go get it!Look for Volume Two in June!*Thanks to the publicist for providing a copy for review.*"
1,Broke in the first week,"I liked the look of the product & the way it worked, for the first few days. But on about the fifth day, I could no longer set the alarm. Pressing the button did nothing. So, now I have an alarm clock that is ALWAYS set for 7 am! There is no obvious ""fix"" for the problem -- the buttons aren't ""depressed"" or anything -- they just don't work to set the alarm anymore."
4,"Compact, Wakes Me Up","The little Sonic Alert SBP100 is all it claims to be. I found it a bit difficult to set. It has no back and forward arrows, so, if it is set for 7 and you need it to be set for 6, you have to go all the way back around. Despite that, I found it ideal as I am nearly deaf in one ear and have loss in the other and the vibration under my pillow gets me up! I travel a lot and find it easy to pack in my purse or roll-aboard. I would recommend it."
1,Missed the old black square Sonic Alert,"I had the black square sonic alert for years until the vibrating part wore out. But it was strong enough to wake me up. So I wanted to order it again and they're no longer available so I selected this alarm. First night I used it I set to ""vibrate&buzz;"" and when it went off, it was nowhere near as strong as the old black sonic alert. Second morning, sure enough I overslept because it wasn't strong enough.Very disappointed because there's no longer a suitable portable alarm clock with a strong vibration."
1,A good idea but poor product,"It was great when it worked. The vibration was slightly too mild but it was enough to wake me. I purchased this more for the purpose of not waking my roommates and less for my sleep problems. For anyone with a genuine sleeping disorder, I would not at all recommend this clock for the reason that it's simply too weak to really grab your attention.Even if the clock were powerful enough, the stupid thing died after only four months of use. I put in new batteries, took out the batteries that were fresh, put in different ones... nothing. The clock worked just fine, but neither the alarm or vibrator would go off when it was supposed to. If I hit ""test,"" both would work just fine. So there was something wrong with the connection between the set alarm and the actual execution of the command.All in all, just spend the extra money to get a quality vibrating alarm clock that will actually last. Four months is just not worth a solid spend."
4,Great alarm for the hearing impaired or deaf,I recently traveled to China for a month for business. I bought this alarm clock due to it's compact size and design. I particularly liked the ability to place it inside the pillow case and clip it onto the pillow case edge. I do not hear at all without my cochlear implants when I sleep. I found the backlight adequate and the battery life great. This alarm never failed to wake me and the four minute snooze was ok. Durability has been super. I'll take it with me to Vietnam for two weeks in April on the next business trip :)
2,Piece of crap,I bought this thinking it would be more portable than my iLuv. It started out working great. Heavy vibration just enough to wake this deaf sleeper. After some time it just wears down and isn't as powerful. I keep it inside my small travel pillow that I use and I barely feel the vibration if at all. Even when I am sleeping on top of the clock I don't even feel it. It's made me rather late to work a few times even. I'm ready to trash this and go back to my trusty iLuv even if it does mean carting around a huge speaker to get the alert I need when it's time to wake up. Sad really cause the iLuv isn't even geared toward deaf like SonicAlert yet it works better over the long term.
2,ackward,"It wakes me up, but finding the snooze button is hard to find. You fumble and fumble to find the button. I would pass this one up and look for a better model."
5,Sonic Alert wakes me up!,"I am recommending Sonic Alert because it works where everything else fails to wake me up. I use the combination bed shaker and have a bright lamp connected to it. The combination is great. It allows for a silent alarm that really works. If I turn up the alarm loud enough for me - its too loud for for others. Great solution!I have always had serious trouble waking up, which caused real problems. Sonic Care has made my life easier."
4,Wakes up heavy sleeper,I bought this for my son who was oversleeping and missing classes. He told me the vibration really does the job waking him up. The fact that it doesn't need to be plugged in and can go anywhere is a plus. It is much smaller than I thought but this makes it great for use as a travel alarm.
4,Wake Up,"I am an extremely heavy sleeper and my biggest fear in life is dying. My second biggest fear in life is over sleeping and being late for a meeting or work. I hate that feeling.What I like to do with this device is place it right under my pillow or in a pocket. When the sonic alert goes off, it's so loud and shocking, I wake up screaming ---- that's how good it is.I've had this for 3 years now and I've yet to change the batteries. I take this baby with me whenever I travel."
5,Works better than expected,"I drive a truck and often on overnight trips... in the truckstops I need a vibrating alarm as I usually sleep with earplugs to block out the drone of idling trucks (including my own...)Being a heavy sleeper and on a schedule I needed something reliable and effective - this proved to be both...The clip on the lanyard works well holding to my waistband and the shape is unobtrusive and comfortable if you end up lying on top of it...It's easy to use, set, and hasn't failed me yet in all the times I've used it (don't count on the beeping to wake you - it's volume is that of a kitchen timer or good digital watch...)"
2,OK for a while -- then just works when batteries first put in,"I am hard of hearing and travel for a living. I cannot just rely on hotel alarm clocks. (Some hotel alarm clocks are low-volume and others are impossible to figure out -- but a different review.) I bought this and used it successfully for maybe 12 times. Then its performance became inconsistent -- not what you want in an alarm clock!They instruct you to travel with the batteries out so it won't go off in the luggage bay and get you arrested. After a while, the clock would work only after I had first put the batteries in, but would not work again until I took the batteries out. (I THINK that was the pattern.) I wanted to test it upon arrival, but couldn't because I kept having to take the batteries out. I became frustrated and lost confidence. Too bad."
2,A major problem,"The noise of the vibrator on a hard surface is very loud. Does a good job of waking the user.Give it a 5 for this.Setting the time and alarm are very difficult. The buttons are too small and very difficult to operate.I don""t trust myself using itA good product badly designedBob"
2,Dissapointing,I bought this alarm to wake up my son. If your expecting loud that is the one thing it is not. The shaker is only good if it is close enough to you and I mean close.I would not recomend this to anyone. I played it for my son the alarm and he laughed and told me his normal clock radio was louder and he sleeps through that.The only good thing is Amazon was excellent about returning it and even paid for shipping just printed out the label and give it to my mail carrier.thank you amazon
2,Sonic Alert SBP100 Sonic Boom Portable Vibrating Alarm Clock,"I purchased this alarm clock for my son, who is 27. He has a lot of difficulty hearing and waking up to a regular alarm. His doctor has told him to get an alarm clock used by deaf people. The vibrating part of the alarm clock wakes him up ... sometimes. But as for the 'sonic boom' part of it...it isn't very loud @ all. Which, doesn't help him much. It's not even loud...in my view...for myself, and I am a light sleeper. That part was disappointing."
1,MF,It's not what i ordered but its too much work to return a $20 dollar item. Ohh the product itself well it tells time. The reason i ordered a vibrating alarm clock was so i couldent hear the annoying noise. You can hear it vibrating rather than feeling it. My loss.
3,Arty Polymer Clay,"The projects in this book are more of a modern artisticway to use polymer clay.I really enjoyed reading about the history of ""clay"".I find the projects interesting and different.I do plan to make the Cactus Candleabra though. Itintrigues me.We have an art district in my area..I plan to make it andplace it in one of the stores. I think it would fit right in."
3,"Its ok, but not the best",A lot of the projects in this book are very different. It doesnt go into great detail in describing how to make the project. I wouldn't recommend the book for beginners.
1,Picture Tube Does Not Last More Than 5 Years,This picture tube gave up after 5 years. Not a long time for today's electronics. Apparently Zenith is known for this flaw.
2,see the movie instead (if there ever is one),"Judging from the reviews there must be a lot of editors that post here because the biggest complaint was the editing. I try not to 'edit' in my mind as I read, so I can't comment on that part.I think the premise of the book was good, but the author tends to 'over-explain' some of the details about the demons and why they are here. I really liked the beginning section in the jungle. I could feel the humidity and the bugs. When the story shifts back to Boston it becomes disjointed. The characters are flat and the dialogue is forced.The ending of the book goes on for far too long. I felt like I was reading a detailed description of how a scene should be directed for a movie. In fact, maybe he should have skipped the book and written the screenplay instead."
2,Couldn't keep me interested,"Started off well. Had an interesting premise. The story moved along pretty well in the beginning. My first problem with the book was I felt the Characters were week. The title character is very 2 dimensional and the rushed and sudden romance is horrible and is actually what made me stop reading the book. It was like the writer felt he had to throw some romance in and it was stupid and unbelievable, and ruined the book for me. I still give the book 2 stars for the premise and a strong beginning."
2,Derivative to the nth degree,"I wanted to like this book, but I'm glad I checked it out of the library instead of buying it. Technically, I had no complaints, and if you can look past the blatantly obvious influences, I suppose it could be enjoyable to those who like horror-tinged thrillers like The Relic.But the influences were painfully obvious to me, and they weren't even books - they were movies! The opening scene is straight out of Saving Private Ryan, the jungle scenes have a flavor very similar to Predator - and that's just the opening part of the book! Relic, whether the book or the movie, is an obvious influence towards the overall plot. There are others, but I don't want to spend that much time on it.Yes, it was a nice effort from one so young, and as I said, good enough on a technical level, which was why I gave it two stars. But if you demand any more than pure fluff from your reading, don't waste your time with this."
1,Pure Crap,"If you like to read things that are poorly researched, and full of errors and cliche's then this book is for you.I, on the other hand, want my money back."
2,Entertaining but shockingly poorly written in parts,"I had a relatively large review written, but it seems pointless as I appear to be in the minority here. Bottom line, this book feels as though it were written by Jason Schwarzman's character in ""Rushmore."" It's derivative and the prose is just awful in places. I'm utterly astounded that it's received such good notices.I will say that it was reasonably entertaining and well-paced. However, it's pretty far from unique. For a better experience, read ""Relic"" and its sequel ""Reliquary."""
4,"Captivating book, detracting errors","This novel is great; well-written, tight, intelligent, and creepy in the best sense. It is a terrible shame that it is also one of the most poorly edited books I've run across. In addition to the missing articles, hanging sentences, dropped plots, and poor spelling, there are content errors as well. A small example comes in the opening pages: chimpanzees are apes, not monkeys. And this point is moot anyway, since they live only in Africa, and not Southeast Asia. It's as jarring as describing polar bears roaming freely around Arizona. I do not hold Mr. Delaney responsible; the onus for professional editing rests squarely with St. Martin's Press. Delaney's fine work deserved better than it got, and here's hoping these errors are corrected by the time the paperback comes out. Grit your teeth and read this book anyway, it's well worth it."
1,A weak book in all aspects,"I can't tell you how disappointed I was in this book. The writing is amatuerish, the story is predictable and the editing...well what can I say about the editing? It is my firm belief that the only editing done here was a run through spell-check."
2,"Great idea, sloppy execution.","The story started interestingly enough, in the jungles during WW2, but once it jumped to present day, it lost it's flow. It was like he was trying too hard to write it for a movie script. If Delaney were to write an all period horror story, I might pick him back up. Also, I'm no editor, but neither was the editor who got paid to edit this book."
1,"Maybe the book was good, but completely unreadable","This book, I was told, was quite good. I wouldn't know since I have poor eye-sight, and the font used in this book was tiny and ran together.The downside of ordering books online is that the font is very rarely mentioned, despite the fact that it makes all the differences in the world. Now I will probably end up selling it for a buck or two, without ever having had the pleasure of reading it.Maybe everyone else in the world can read tiny typeface, but I certainly can not, and do not have th resources to throw away $20 here and there for a book no one will read.I plan on asking Amazon about a refund, or exchange, anything, so that this will not happen again in the future.Meanwhile, on any auction of ours, on any review I leave, I will try to always mention to font and readability. I would deeply appreciate it if anyone else writing reviews would do the same thing.Thank you for reading my two-cents worth.~Mariance"
2,His creative writing teacher should be fired!,"OK, the kid can write, but he's sorely lacking in discipline -- and by the way, his publishing company did a real disservice by not putting a strong editor on this manuscript. Rule number one -- write what you know... and it's hard to believe this recent college grad could know much about jungle battles in WWII, technological advances of the near future, post-traumatic stress, and the cynical wisdom of a pair of veteran homicide detectives. I finally gave up around page 300 of 450 pages... I just didn't care about the people or the mystery."
1,HOW DID THIS GET PUBLISHED?,THIS IS SIMPLY THE WORST WRITTEN BOOK I HAVE EVER READ. I WOULD GIVE IT ZERO STARS IF I COULD. I HOPE THIS AUTHOR NEVER WRITES ANOTHER BOOK. DO NOT BUY. NOTHING MORE NEEDS TO BE SAID.
1,"Was there an editor, or any research done?","This author needs an editor, badly. I put this book down in frustration after 121 pages. First of all, he mentions the Battleship Missouri as being active in 1943, the ship's keel was not laid until 1944. There are continuity mistakes. He mentions that the pilots had breakfast, then two pages later mentions that the pilots stomachs felt empty since standard dive procedure disallowed any food within 12 hours of the dive. All in all, I'd say not a good beginning. Most authors have editors, and friends who read their work over, this is greatly needed in this case."
1,Amateur hour,"""Jinn"" violates just about every principle essential to the revision process. Too many details? Not enough characterization? Tells instead of shows? Check. Check. Check. Whether in the jungles of the Pacific islands, an offshore prison, or a Boston skyscraper, Delaney buries any plot or character momentum with a bunch of ""they turned here and saw A, B, and C, then they ran into the next corridor and noted D, E, and F..."" etc. The love interest is arbitrary and not organic, and the head-hopping and name changing throughout flashback scenes is bizarre and really disengages the reader from the content.There may be some creative storytelling ideas buried within this rough draft, but it's the author's job - not yours - to discover and refine what works and what doesn't."
2,I can't read this..,"After squinting my way through a third of this book, I had to throw in the towel. A font that size is usually reserved for Dickens' ""literature"" and other dry, college textbooks. The other shortcomings of this book have been thoroughly and ably covered. I'll never know. A poorly produced and edited piece of work."
2,POW! BAM! fizzle,"This novel started out with a bang, great action, suspense, creepiness, but then it just fizzled. It got really random and boring, I was no longer interested about halfway through or so, i flipped to the end and moved on. Being this authors first book i will say good try."
4,Great first book,"While I agree with some of the editing comments, I have to say such a great and big idea for a first novel holds some bit of allowance. Can't blame the author. The idea is out there and involves so many different areas of popular fiction that anyone could pick it up and enjoy a great read. My only comment is that you may have to come in rested for one of two reasons..1) Matt is going to at times take you over your bedtime by 1 or maybe 2 hours. 2) My only discount towards this novel is that is at times complicated. You need to stay on your toes, but well worth the effort. I keep looking back at Matt's name on my favorites list to see if he has another novel I can enjoy. Overall, very recomended."
2,"Disappointing, so very disappointing","So I read the PW review and thought this book would be an ideal read, reminiscent of THE RELIC. But no. The beginning portion teases the reader and then fails to deliver. It is more a distraction than a true opening. Then, midway through the book, the author decides to change the rules and suddenly what began as a military thriller with supernatural elements shifts to a cop drama and then to a weird religious horror novel. I'm not at all a fan of the later. Christian menaces are silly, and the final revelations ruin the book. I actually grew bored 50% in and just skimmed ahead and read the last few pages. I then recycled the paperback."
2,Jinn doesn't deliver the goods,"Matthew Delaney's debut novel, ""Jinn"", promises much, but delivers little. Advertised as a cross between ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Relic"", ""Jinn"" is neither. It's an uneven thriller that tries too hard to shock its readers. It reminded me of the film trailers that show the viewer so many of the good parts of the movie that when the person actually goes to see the picture he or she is really let down by the fact that they're already see the best part of the film during the previews.This is a book that I really wanted to work, (and spent a lot of time trying to find) so this reader is more than just a little disappointed.Here's hoping though, that Delaney doesn't give up and keeps working on his trade. His pacing is plodding and he needs to work on character development, but he does show some promise. It's just that it took him 400 pages in this novel to get to a pretty good ending.Stick with Preston and Child and visit Delaney at a later time."
3,The Last Detail,"A fair ""resurrected demon"" story for the most part. My biggest beef with it was that the writer gives us too many details. (is that possible?) This may be an exaggeration but I don't need to know what happens with each step the person is making or what their right hand is doing each second. My brain can fill in the blanks...thank you very much. Perhaps some editing would have trimmed this book down to a taut thriller. As it is, it's a bit too long-winded for my tastes."
2,too long and too uneven,"Just got done with Jinn. What started out promising spiraled down into Sci-Fi Channel movie type of idiocy. The book was badly edited, it could easily been pared down to 315 or so pages.It had an interesting premise but the author just does'nt make it scary. The bogus dialogue did'nt help any, either. How come the Saint character, a man out on parole, was'nt sent back to jail after admitting to burglarizing the lawyer's house? Is'nt burglary a parole violation? Many scenes which should have been creepy were so lamely written that they were just words strung together. The author had no sense of atmosphere or anticipation in so many of the important scenes.Maybe because the author, Delaney is young and needs more writing experience under his belt, he could do better in his next effort.Hire a good editor!"
3,The three stars are only for the first half of the book.,"This book had me excited in the beginning and then had me skipping ahead at the end just to get it over with! I loved the start of this book, very cool war scenes, scary thing killing people, even the underwater ocean scene had me spooked, then.... It fell apart. The book started jumping around mid way and then there were flash backs and it never really got back to being as good as it started off being. I was speed reading towards the end so I could read something else. Overall a disappointment."
3,Not a bad first try,"I agree with other reviewers that the book was inconsistent in its theme. The flow was awkward and I think that a good editor could have made revisions. Objects are used and then suddenly reappear, subjects are brought up and then never again addressed.I think the author has great potential and I would read another of this books with the hope that he is able to refine his talent."
3,"Some parts good, some parts not so good","When the action is flying, this book is hard to put down. But in between those sequences, the dialogue and the plot get a bit weighted down. I thought that some of the characters were interesting, but others lacked motivation. The action kept the plot moving, but there were some big holes in the storyline as well. Overall the book reminded me a lot of Dean Koontz, so fans of his might enjoy this book."
4,Cool transformer with some help,I love my Transformer but I'm 5 1/2 and I still need some help from a grown up to change it up. The missiles broke off on the very first day.
4,A fun rendition of a classic Decepticon,"This is one of the better renditions of Starscream that I have personally seen. Both transformations look very nice, and the robot mode is fairly poseable. The only major problem I have with this toy is that the wings will not fold horizontally across his back. This means that when I lift Starscream's arm as if he was firing a shot at a dirty Autobot, the back of his weapon runs into his wing. You can move the wing out the way, but doing so looks unnatural. Otherwise, this is a quality toy in every way, and I'd recommend it to Transformers fans."
5,this is a wonderful book!,"This book was really great- funny, gritty, and moving. The psychology of the characters is very real- when Charlotte's father's ""manhood"" is undermined, he takes out his anger on the only people he has power over- his own family. The children in this book are portrayed as wise, imaginative individuals.This book should be read by people of all ages."
1,not what i expected,"yuk! I expected this to be a thick, luxurious creme. Instead, its very runny and I don't like the texture of it at all. I love the perfume, but not this stuff!"
5,I love Rosamund Pilcher,This is a lovely short read about unrequited love that finally finds its way home to it's lovely end. Worthwhile reading.
2,Too Simple,"This is a little novel and a quick read. Like all of Rosamunde Pilcher's books, it is a romance with a happy ending. I just thought this one was too simple. By page 5 I already knew how the story would end. It's not a bad book, just simple and predictable. I like the way the author describes the countryside, the houses, the food, etc. So it was still good to read. Just simple."
5,"A warm, touching story","This was the first book I ever read by Rosamunde Pilcher and I liked it so much that I subsequently sought out all of her other books. I have to disagree with the reviewer who described the main character, Virginia, as someone who was evidently content to let her life be dictated to her. She was not content, and this is described more than once in the book, through flashbacks. She was simply a person who had been dominated by a controlling mother her entire life and never learned to take control of a situtation herself. This book is about second chances and how she learns to be an assertive and truly alive person. I found it a joy to read."
4,Great product,"Printer kept jamming, cleaned it, and used different papers, but nothing helped, finally replaced this belt, and no more jams. Product was as advertised, and sent quickly. recommend this company."
4,Check It Out Now!!!,"This book is awesome!!!Cindy and her friends get bad luck all thanx to a black cat....Its fun to read...they go to the sementery, beach and more places..They even talk to a hobo!! i love this book...a guy gets lucked up on a cave and.........well find out for yourself!!!!"
4,GooD,"My favorites are Sally , Bryce and Cindy. Bryce because is like cute and is always thinking the worse jaja, Sally because she make me laugh very much and because she is the one who like to do the comments that make feel angry the other person, and I like CIndy because she is cute and pretty cool and the most sensitive. The most I like the book is that Cindy like Adam but I dont think that Adam like she like she does, he has being tryng to say her that he likes she but he cant.Hey someone that have read the Creepy Creature, Phone Fear or Witch give, can tell me what happened because I dont have those books. I live in Mexico and here the finished book is the number #21 and I am very anxious to know what happened, if Adam and Olos are boyfriends or if Bryce and Cindy still Boyfriends. really I want to know!!!!If you know you can write me to : [...]Thank you,byeP.D: My name is Blanca and I have 13 years."
5,Sublime,"I can't say enough about how great this guy is. He writes, performs on and produces his own cds. He plays in different styles (he's an awesome singer and instrumentalist) and is clearly influenced by many great artists, yet is distinctively himself. Check out ""Let's Hope Nobody Finds Us"" - the best song Brian Wilson never wrote, complete with a breathtaking wash of background harmonies, all Lewis. Even though the music is melodic and accessible, Lewis experiments often, frequently re-recording his own songs with different arrangements. This particular album was intended to show another side of Lewis apart from his soul stuff, and is simply another tour de force. His albums are so richly layered, emotionally nourishing and satisfying that any one might qualify as a ""desert island"" disc. It's astounding how he hasn't had success with major labels and hasn't penetrated the US market! Without a doubt the finest artist I've heard in any number of years."
3,Great Lighthearted Fun,"Unwise Child (1962) by Randall Garrett - 215 pages - rating: 7.5/10Scientists have secretly developed a computer intelligence that has unfortunately manifested some undesirable characteristics. Mike the Angel , the classic 1960's style hero / wealthy engineer, must join the team responsible for moving the house sized computer from the isolated arctic installation to an even more remote facility on a distant ice planet. Unknown to Mike someone else aboard ship has plans of his own.This highly enjoyable piece of 1960's nostalgia is perhaps the quickest and easiest book to read I've ever come across. It never gets to serious or intense but provides an afternoon of laughs and sometimes exciting entertainment.Claus Kellermann2006 May 13Sci_Fi_Researcher@yahoo.com"
4,The Reference for Mental Ray Standalone,"The description of this book is not, as another reviewer mentioned, misleading. It doesn't mention 3ds Max, Maya, or Lightwave. The important thing to note here is that Mental Ray is first and foremost a standalone rendering package. The fact that today's major 3D applications import and make accessible a subset of it's functionality seems to be the cause of a lot of confusion. This is not a 3ds Max book, or a Maya book. If you're looking to find out what buttons to push or what steps to take to use certain features of Mental Ray in your favorite 3D package, this book is NOT for you. There's plenty of information floating around for free on the internet that can answer those questions.This book, and it's companion ""Programming Mental Ray"" is for those needing to tap into the full power of the Standalone Mental Ray renderer."
5,The perfect book for the TD light,"I just purchase this book 2 weeks ago and i am definitely happy to bought it.All you ask yourself, the answers are there. the best way to achieve fine tuning and exceptional optimization. So, if you need a deep understanding of Mental Ray, let's go !But be aware, if you only like light and play with button, that is not the right book. it's not a tutorial or a how to, it's a technical explanation of the action behind the code.Very technical, but so useful to use all the power of this engine."
4,"getting problem in accessing "".mi"" files in maya7","we are the students of 3d animation of Maya7.We had purchased the book named as ""Rendering withmental ray, vol-1 "" by T.Driemeyer(Third edition) whose ISBN no. is 3211228756 and we gota CD along with this book containing reference files (.mi) format and ""Mental Ray"" demo versionsoftware.Our, problem is we are not able to open the "".mi"" files in Maya7 or anyother version ofmaya.The ""Mental Ray"" software is not working in ""Windows XP"" platform as it gives the error""file ray3rc is not found"".Hence, i am writing the mail please kindly send us way to deal or solution ofthe above mentioned problem.It will be better for us that those "".mi"" can open with Maya 7version.PROBLEMS:1) Workability of mental ray software (given with the book) in ""windows XP""platform2) Workability of "".mi"" files in Maya 7 inteface."
2,Rendering with mental ray not for non-programmers,"The description of this book is totally misleading. It only discusses how to use mental ray through the running of scripts and programming language. It dicusses absolutely nothing as far as the manner in which mental ray is used in 3ds max. Does not explain mental ray through the use of traditional menus and the render dialogue box in 3ds max. No mention of what good settings are for GI values or lighting values. The entire book centers around entering information manually in script form rather than going through how mental ray works in 3ds max through the render dialogue box. The only reason this book gets 2 stars is that it does have a good glossary of terms. Of course, those terms can be retrieved from the standard 3ds max help menu. I am a very experienced 3ds max user and was simply looking to learn some more advanced features of mental ray, and I was extremely disappointed in the book, especially for $85."
2,Not what I expected from previous reviews,"This book was ""pumped up"" on the reviews. But actually it was a rambling of unimportant information. It constantly jumped around in sections that several times I reread to make sure I was following correctly. There was no incite given on the motives or reasonings. There was some information that was good. I thought after a while it was going to be from th police perspective but it wasn't that either. You didn't get to know really any of the key components or key players. Then I though Well maybe it will be told from the wife's perspective no once again. There was constant rambling of who was in office or who was running for this position. I couldn't really get a handle on whose perspective this story was being told. I felt areas that should have been focused on weren't like the crimes themselves or the victim that survived. Instead it was just rambling."
3,Maisto toy car - messed up order & unresponsiveness,I did not receive the product I ordered (a 2004 Black Porsch 911 Carrera)insted I was sent a red Porsch later model year. I just want to return it but the vendor supplied no return info. I have been in touch with Amazon several times on this matter but as of yet it in unresolved and I still do not know where to ship it back to. I am not happy with the vendor' lack of response on the handleing of this matter.
4,Let's Explore Creature Homes,"You get to go underground with a Prarie Dog,dig with a Meercat,and lots of other anazing things."
3,Like it,I really purchased this item aft having circulation problems but what they do not tell you is that this item just brings one arm and if you need it for both you would have to order two. Most likely you would need it for both arms instead of just one. This is a total rip off I would say because for the most part everyone has two arms.
1,Terrible product. All the buttons are covered with black plastic so you dont know what you are typing.....,You cannot see the buttons because they are all covered up with black silicone. Terrible design... Ihad to cut away all the plastic now it does not fit right....
4,What Next? Yanni/Kenny G/Michael Bolton/Celine Dion?,"Let me say up front that I could make all ten of my Desert Island choices from the Grisman/Rice catalog. And I really like this album, it's a surprise (not really, given the quality of the musicians) that their adaptation of these south-of-the-border rhythms is beautiful.It's that damned flute! I find myself cringing in anticipation of the moments when it intrudes its incongruously frilly tones into this beautiful, moody music. For me the flute takes this otherwise beautiful music into the New Age/Lite Jazz realm, with images of skipping children, butterflies, and down blowing across sunlit fields... Argh! Stifle that gag reflex!Some like the addition of the flute - me, I'd edit it out...if not for the flute, this would be a ""5"" rating..."
5,I bought a second one,"Ended up buying a second one for my husband to use. These mats are super thick which is important in our all tile rental. They are cracking a little, but it's not that big of a deal."
2,Too Slippery,"This mat is definitely soft and provides great cushioning, but they aren't kidding when they write ""impervious to water."" Any amount of sweat that falls on it creates a slick surface, making it impossible to hold plank poses, pushups, etc. I bought this item in part because it was frequently sold along with Jillian Michaels DVDs, but anyone who has done her workouts knows that you will sweat!"
5,Good Thick Cushion,"I have two mats, this thicker one from Danskin and a thinner one from Gaiam. I have a spiny back and weak hands, and I prefer this thicker mat because it helps a lot in protecting them against the hard floor when I'm doing sit-ups and push-ups.Even though the mat is very light, I only use this at home since it is too large to be carrying around. It is about three times the thickness of my thinner mat. This mat has two sides, a smooth top side, and a rippled bottom side for anti-slip protection, so it is even good for jogging-in-place.I once had Neosporin cream on my leg which oiled the mat. So I recommend you make sure you don't have any oily cream on before using it."
5,Great Mat!!,"I love the thickness of this mat. It is very cushioned and serves it's purpose. Unlike other reviewers, I don't mind rolling it up and slipping the strap on. It is a very nice color. I would definitely recommend!!"
2,Produc t a disappoint,"TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN:I was disappointed to find that the exercise mat that arrived at my home was only about 3/8th of an inch thick. I expected something at least 1 and 1/2 inch thick.Thank you for giving me the opportunity to ""speak up""."
2,I've seen better,"The mat is okay, but I've seen better ones out there. I wish I knew before I bought it that it does not have velcro straps to hold the mat closed....instead it has this loose piece that you're supposed to carry around to put on the mat after you roll it up to keep it closed. That's a pain."
5,Still a Classic,"I gave this five stars because it deserved it. It's still a classic and still a lot of fun to read. However, readers be warned. You must remember it was written in 1919. Stereotypes abound. Women are voluptous, wear very little clothing and are either totally good or totally evil. If you can make allowances for all that, then it's a thoroughly enjoyable romp and the author's imagination is stunning. Today, he would place his adventure on an alien planet. In 1919, the vast uncharted regions of the Pacific were vast and alien enough to contain lost races, lost civilizations, unimaginable science, etc. My recommendation is to suspend all disbelief and critical judgment and simply enjoy."
4,great imaginative fantasy from the time before the world had,abraham merritt: a great writer from the age before the far corners of the world had been explored. when there was still a sense of innocence about what the world contained. it is gone now that we have investigated the whole world. there are no strange islands in the south pacific; no metal monsters in outer mongolia; no bridges to valhalla above the artic circle in scandinavia. there are times when knowing too much hurts the ability to dream. from pat taylor
1,THIS SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,THIS IS THE WORST DO IT YOUR SELF PSP SKIN KIT IN THE WORLD !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
5,Recalls the importance on the father's role,"Where's Daddy?: The Mythologies Behind Custody-Access-Support is a stinging indictment of the Custody-Access-Support oriented judicial system, attacking the five most commonly employed myths to defend this legal code interpretation resulting in the estranging of divorced fathers from their children. More than that, Where's Daddy? calls upon a society that vilifies divorced fathers and separates them from their children to reexamine itself, and recall the importance on the father's role, one that is currently all too easily pushed aside both by legal practice and by the popular culture. Where's Daddy? is a strongly worded and highly recommended clarion call for reform that needs to be heard for the sake of today's children, and the children of generations to come."
1,don't waste your time or money,"The author of this books has a chip on his shoulder and/or a persecution complex. He is clearly only a father's rights activist, and therefore only presents one side to the issue. The book propagates untrue and harfmul stereotypes. I found it misleading and inaccurate. If you want to look at ALL sides of the custody issue, I recommend this book for the father's rights perspective. However, I recommend you balance it off with a mother's rights perspective as well if you want to be objective. I'd rather save time and read something balanced and objective to begin with."
5,Title says it all...,My wife and I have to sneak this one away from our son! Very entertaining for both the kids and the parents. Fun kids' tunes with a classic Garcia and Grisman musicianship. Defintiely shows a lighter side of these guys...this one is highly recommended!
5,Better than Xanax for babies,"This CD calmed our newborn son into quietude by the end of the opening bars of ""Jenny Jenkins"" every single time. Garcia and Grisman's voices are so gentle and soothing that it's calming for young ones, and their wit and humor never disappoints the adults.I have a theory about kids and banjo music: I have yet to find a child who doesn't respond positively to it, and I think it's because it's rhythmic, quiet and silly at the same time. People who associate him primarily with his endless Grateful Dead guitar jams may not know that Jerry Garcia was a very skilled banjo picker. David Grisman's mandolin adds harmony and a faraway soulful sound, a perfect combination for the traditional songs on this album."
