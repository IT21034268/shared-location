2,Pearl Jam can not play with Neil Young anymore!,"Pearl Jam seems to be following in the footsteps of their hero Neil Young. They are so concerned about being commercial they are alienating all of their fans. Considering the talent in this band it is definitely a tragedy. This CD has very few keepers on it. The highlights are "" of the girl"" and ""Sleight of hand"". The rest are equal to anything you will find in the bargain bin at your local music store. Even the 1st single released off the CD does not match what Pearl Jam has released as ""B"" sides of their singles in the past. Eddie Vedder has one of the best voices around and he chooses not to let anyone appreciate it. I just hope the next CD will not take 2 years and be this big of a disappointment. Hopefully the tour will be better. 2 stars! Just because it is Pearl Jam and I am not the editor at Rolling Stone which would give PJ 5 stars for passing wind."
2,They've lost it,"Pearl Jam died, and this was the nail in the coffin. Gone are the furious beats of Vs, the melodic enchant of Ten, and the pure grunge soul of Vitalogy. All I hear is a weak, tired band that has run out of fuel."
2,The sparkle has dulled,"After a rather lackluster effort with Yield, the addition of Matt Cameron's songwriting and drumming talents to the group should have pushed PJ in a new direction. Instead, we have an album which is instantly forgettable, making one wonder if they have any good material left in them for album 7.AVOID!"
2,a little dissapointed,"Being a huge music fan, and also being a moderate pearl jam fan i was excited to hear the new album. I was used to the normal pearl jam album, four or five brilliant songs and the rest getting skipped over, but i must say i was truly dissapointed with this album. Eddie Vedder seems distant and doesnt connect with the flow of the songs, the music is sometimes to much to handle, to much at once i suppose. If you like pearl jam, buy the live on two legs album, not this one, you will find yourself putting it in the back of your cd collection."
3,Pearl jam = overatted,"Simple as that. I mean this album has a few good songs, but this aint no vs. or ten. There fans say o those were the worst and wont look at reality. Pearl jam is an amazing live band, but this cd is not so great. Its 3 stars for average. Nothing legendary. FACE IT, THERE NOT THE BEST. Live, theres a band thats been around since pearl jam started, but STILL makes good music. These are Neil Young wanna be has been's"
1,Let down again,"Once again I rushed out to get the newest Pearl Jam Cd in hopes that they might accidently stumble back upon their glory days of Ten or VS.. Just like the times before I was let down. If these guys want to keep experimenting with new directions for music do us a favor and stop selling the results. ""Nothing as it seems"" should have been a clue. It showed possible potential that they were back on track. However, since ""nothing is as it seems"" I was mislead again. Rounding out the album are tunes like ""soon forget"" which could even make Tiny Tim cringe. Once again Pearl Jam disappoints."
3,Not as good as others,"This album isn't a patch on any other Pearl Jam album.Pearl Jam can do better.I'd reccomend any other Pearl Jam album instead of this. Don't bother listening to anyone who rated this 5 stars, they havent a clue. I reccomend Yield or Riot Act instead of this. They have a similar sound but are 10 times better.Yield is the better of the two."
2,"Can You Say "" No Code "" ?","Allright, so Eddie, Stone, Jeff, Mike and Matt are no John, Paul, George and Ringo.. This album is a big dissapointment after listening to something as strong and sound-filled as ""Yield"". This reminds me of listening to No Code after having enjoyed ""Vitalogy"" as much as I did. Light Years and Insignificance are strong original PJ tunes, but the rest is fruitless.. I'd rate this album slightly higher than No Code, but not much. Too bad I bought PJ Tour tickets before I got a chance to listen to Binaural.. I'd be doing something else on Halloween otherwise."
2,The Cover is Great!,"I give 2 starts for the cover artwork and for the massive promotion. The music is as good as good as any other Pearl Jam album in the mid and late 90's, if you like those albums, listen to them insted of buying another one who sounds pretty much the same (though seems like the quality here is very poor. now what kind of stupid gimic is that! )."
4,not their best but definately a must have,Its good to see a good band that is still putting out some amazing music. Personally I think this is one of the best albums to come out recently. Some people dont like the album because it doesnt conatin numerous radio hits like ten or vitology but radio play isnt everything. I own all of pearljams studio albums excluding no-code (witch I will soon be purchaseing) and this isnt my favorite album but a good album none the less. There is some truely great tracks on this record and I suggest it to anyone who likes good music.
3,i like pearl jam,"the band who says they will never change, is still sticking with their vow. if anything this album seems to sound similar to their older albums. the problem with this album is the lack of a fantastic song. all the songs are good but its missing a ""betterman"", a ""given to fly"", a ""off he goes"", a ""jeremy"", or a ""daughter"". instead its thirteen good vintage pearl jam songs. like many of pearl jam's other albums there is the experimental song. this one happens to be the nick drake like ""soon forget"". my two complaints are that ""grievance"" and ""insignigicance"" sounds too much alike. also ""thin air"" sounds like a continuation of ""last kiss"". the highpoint of the album comes early in ""god's dice"" and the brilliant ""light years"". overall not their best, but certainly not to be missed."
4,You have to wonder,"Every Pearl Jam album is extremely different from the last and this one is no different, probably because of the more band-oriented production that progressively kept going into each album. Eddie Vedder's voice is still like no other and still above them. This album is not a comeback to the days of Ten where the music is up-tempo and you can just scream along. You have to remember that the band is not in their mid twenties anymore and their views have changed. Nonetheless, every pearl jam album is worth having, especially if you grew along with the band."
4,"good, not fantastic","Growing up listening to Pearl Jam, I have developed a deep sense of respect and passion for their music. Their sound has certainly changed over the years, but I wouldn't say it's gotten worse, just different. Binaural is a carefully crafted work, but I don't think it's for everyone. The songs are not catchy, yet they all seem to say something. Each song will speak to people differently, but I think that everyone will walk away with something they didn't have before."
1,big disappointment,"I was really looking forward to the release of this album. However, it turned out to be a big disappointment. I bought it this morning and listened to it for two times, and I can only say that I find it extremely boring. No melodies that can carry a tune (and those few melodies that might be able to do so are embarrassingly clich√©d), no surprising song structures, no or hardly any remarkable or memorable guitar riffs. In absence of these things, bands quite often turn to 'oddities' like, for example, using technically wrong chords, as in ""Soon forget"", etc. Things like that may make a good song more interesting, but they can not turn a dull song into an exciting one. Unfortunately, it seems as if Pearl Jam have run out of ideas."
2,Pearl Jam's worst album yet,"Now, first off, I'd just like to say that I am a huge fan of Pearl Jam, and think everything they did was brilliant.That is, until Binaural.You see, ""Binaural"" tries so hard to be the next ""Dark Side of The Moon"", and it falls flat on its face. Pearl Jam were NOT meant to be a psychedelic/acoustic group at all. They are at their best when they're making rock anthems, whether they be straight-forward ones (""Ten"", ""Vs."") or hidden treasures (""Vitalogy""). THERE IS NOT ONE DECENT ROCK SONG ON THE ALBUM. No matter how hard ""Grievance"" and ""Rival"" try, neither of them are normal PJ quality.So please Pearl Jam, with your next album (planned to release in November), go back to rock. Your fanbase will mutiply and you'll be the biggest band in the world again."
3,Maybe 3 and a half,"It's a good album. Not very good. What I'm trying to say is that Binaural is like No Code and Yield. If you liked them you'll like this one very much. Pearl Jam has changed since Ten and VS, for me the best of them, but as I said Binaural is a good work."
3,morrison is alive in eddie veder,"if jim morrison were alive today, he would have maximum repect for eddie veder and the boys from pearl jam. they have not sold out. each record gets less commercial and like the band crockpot out of roanoke, va, pearl jam relies more on creative prowess than sheer musical talent. the album ""binural"" will not contend w/ britany spears for album sales or teenage fans, but in 20 years people will still care about the music the doors, uhh i mean pearl jam is making today."
5,90s music for the 00s,"Binaural is not a departure from any of Pearl Jam's other efforts. It's basically more material from who are arguably the best live act in the world today. The problem in Binaural is not the album: is that the world has outgrown Pearl Jam's music. Binaural is just more of the same. That's good news if you don't want them to change. The record has to be the more listenable since Vitalogy. Only a couple of songs I can consider filler, the rest is as good as anything Pearl Jam has ever done. Nothing as it seems: Powerful. Thin Air: Beautiful. Breakerfall: Catchy. Soon Forget: Hummable. Light Years: Solid. Insignificance: Addictive. Is a good record from a band that I believe has never release a bad one."
2,Not as good as good old grunge days,I was a fan ever since Mother Love Bone came out and the next two albums by pearl jam per se (addition of eddie) ARE the ultimate in grunge music. I know eddie hasn't lost his passion and voice but the songs on Binaural just doesn't have the punch as in earlier albums.. except maybe couple of songs. The albums has a great start but fizzles out a little too early just when you are jamming up and are at that high that you are so used to if you like the songs such as 'rearview mirror'....I'm seeing them live in couple of weeks in mountain view and I just hope they play more of their older songs... jeremy spoke in spoke in ~ ~ jeremy spoke in classss todayyy
5,STILL THE BEST,"THE FIRST 10 TRACKS ARE INCREDIBLE!!!ESPECIALLY RIVAL,WHAT A GREAT SONG BY STONE. BEST ALBUM RELEASED BY ANYONE THIS YEAR. ONLY DOWNFALL WAS MCCREADY NOT WRITING MORE SONGS LIKE HE DID ON YIELD. MIKE COULD HAVE HELPED OUT WITH TRACKS 11,13 WHICH I FIND ARE A LITTLE WEAK."
3,"Sorry, but this just isn't what they're capable of.","I would say that Pearl Jam is the best ""mainstream"" band, and all of their records have been great until this one. Now every hard-core Pearl Jam fan will love this just for who recorded it, but a lot of other people will most likely be dissapointed with this record. Fist off, the first track is closer to a Who rip-off than a Who inspiration. The rhythm riff is the same as The Who's ""I Can See For Miles"", and the riff over top of it will make any Who fan remember ""Slip Kid."" There are some good songs here, but you should definitely check them out to decide if they are worth the price of the cd. Compared to most of the crap on the radio nowadays, this is refreshing. Compared to everything else Pearl Jam has done, this doesn't measure up. At all. A collection of their b-sides would be a better bet than this album. To sum it up: unless you're a die-hard fan, or just want to say that you own all Pearl Jam's cd's, this one's probably not worth it."
3,Let down -- breakmyfall,"Wow. I can't say how disappointed I am by this one. I loved Yield so I was anxiously awaiting Binaural. There isn't even a track that I go to just to crank up. Another reviewer had it right -- if this was a new CD by an unknown band, we'd all probably hope all over it. But, it isn't and I'm not even sure Binaural will even stay in the 10-disc rotation on my card CD player. I'm not sure what they were trying to do with this album. It just seems muddy and disjointed and ultimately highly mediocre (oh and, Eddie, about the new bleach blond look...). Anyway, I'm not giving up -- I'm sure I'll buy the next one and will catch the tour this fall -- but if I can't get into the groove of Binaural over the next 3 or 4 listens, well...."
5,Heard it: had to buy it,"I bought Ten and Vs. when they came out, and then I kind of forgot about PJ for a while. Then I heard ""Nothing As It Seems"" a few times on the radio (they only played it a few times) and I FLIPPED and bought the CD. This album is great. ""Parting Ways"" and ""Nothing As it Seems"" are my favs, but I also love ""Light Years"" ""THin Air"" and ""Soon Forget"". Some of the other songs take time to grow on you, but they do. As usual, their lyrics are amazing. This is not really hard rock for PJ, in fact most of it is pretty mellow, and I guess that disappointed some fans, but I'm glad they don't keep cranking out the same old stuff. How 'bout that ukelele?!"
3,People have to defend it..it's sorta weak,"Well I'm a big 'ol Pearl Jam fan..I do even like this album, but rarely listen to it. It doesn't completely just blow like I first thought it did..but it's close to. I would have given it 2 1/2 stars if I could have..and that hurts my Pearl Jam pride but at least I admit it. TONS of fans get VERY defensive about this album and try to talk it up, but I honestly feel they are in denial and just can't cope with speaking a bad word about anything Pearl Jam puts out. The songs on here are good, but only good..nothing noteworthy, nothing spectacular...it has it's moments, but most albums do. I was, and am, disspointed by this album.It is DEFINITLEY missing something that the other Pearl Jam albums had...the other albums had a 'culture' of their own, this one seems to copy the others and try to mix the styles, but poorly. That's how I feel about it...and I've made PJ ""my band"" so to speak...this album ain't that grand."
5,A Commercial Nightmare and Pearl Jam couldn't care less,"This album doesn't have much potential for radio singles, and as most of you know, Pearl Jam doesn't care. This may be Pearl Jam's best album ever overall. None of the songs would make it in my top five Pearl Jam songs of all time (Maybe Thin Air), but this album doesn't really have any bad songs."
4,Back to their roots,"I liked this CD alot. I'm a Pearl Jam fan who much prefers their earlier CDs. What I liked about their earlier work, and about this CD, is how well this group cranks out go old rock and roll. Most of the tracks could have been written in the '60s or '70s, and that's just fine with me. I would have preferred more Mcready solos, and I think the engineering could have been better (on some tunes, the vocals are drowned out by the instrumentals). But on the whole, I'm pleased Pearl Jam has returned to their roots and encourage others who enjoy rock and roll at its most basic to pick this CD up."
2,INSIGNIFCANCE,"REALY THE WHOLE CD LACKS ENTERGY. SAVE YOUR BUCKS UNLESS YOUR A DIEHARD FOR P.J. MOVE ON TO GREATER THINGS, LIKE RAGE AGAINST THE MACHINE... NOW THAT ROCKS!"
2,disappointing,"If you enjoy bands like Creed and Kid Rock and current hard rock/alternative music ignore this review. This is for those who like I, much prefer Phish, Allman Bros., Grateful Dead, etc. Pearl Jam used to be my favorite band...My interest in the band faded after Vitalogy, but I decided to pick up this CD because I am going to see them live this summer. I don't want to sound like a 95 year old woman, but to me it sounds like a bunch of noise with little focus. It is very difficult to distinguish each guitar part. It seems like there is so much distortion and reverb on the songs that they all mesh together to form a mass of noise. The slow songs are certainly not up to the standards of anything off of their first three albums. I wasn't expecting another ""Ten"" but didn't expect a 2 star album."
3,Below Par,"I have always been a huge Pearl Jam fan, but this album is not their best effort. A few of the songs are destined to be PJ classics, but the album on the whole is not very good. I used to be able to listen to PJ's other albums all the way through without having to skip tracks, but this is not the case with Binaural. I just hope that the next album is better. Is this the end for Pearl Jam?"
1,Poor effort,"I think Pearl Jam's problem is whenever they do an album is the media calls its a classic album, this album is so selfcentered, Im pretty sure Eddie Vedder could sing Mary had a little lamb, and the fans aand the media would call him the next John lennon. The songs on this album are so trite, I have already taken it in to the secondhand store."
3,One good song but overall not good,"Nothing as it seems. I bought this alblum thinking it would be like Vs. or Last Kiss (single) the only bright spot of this alblum is nothing as it seems, which is an incredible song, about as good as Daughter or Last Kiss. I'd give it 21/2 stars. Buy the single for Nothing as it seems if you want a good song/value"
2,An OK CD by Pearl Jam,"Being a huge Pearl Jam fan I had to buy this new CD Binaural, I figured anything by PJ would be great. I bought the CD and listened to it and I hate to say that I was disapointed. Over the years that Pearl Jam has been around there music has gotten softer and softer, most of the songs on this CD are pratically light listening. I wish PJ could get back to there roots and play the kind of music that they are great at. If you liked old Pearl Jam music a lot and are into that kind of music, chances are you won't like this CD much."
4,good i guess,"I have not really heard this album..just a couple of tracks but i can tell its a good cd...much better than Yield. Many people have said to me that Nothing as it seems is such a slow, boring, coma-inducing song but i disagree. You have to listen to it a few times to appreciate its magnificence. Its a good follow up to Last Kiss which is a classic. Vedder's voice always spellbounds me and i am taken to the very core of the lyrics....you FEEL them. Pearl Jam can be content with this one."
3,Pearl Jam has Changed,"When I first heard Binatural, I was quite dissapointed. The album starts out strong, but as it goes on, it gets slower and weirder. You can tell these guys have changed. They will never be like they used to be. Their old stuff is so much better than this. I listened to it over and over thinking that it will grow on me, but it didnt happen. I have to say this is their weakest effort on an album."
2,"It's so, so...blah?","Big PJ fan. Own and love all their records. Been looking forward to this record as something new, different and interesting. I wasn't looking for another Yield, Vs. or anything else they had put out. After three listens I just don't find it very interesting. Except for a couple of songs the rest is just dull. No particular aspect of the album holds my interest for long. DULL. I am truly sorry to say this, but to this Pearl Jam fan, it IS kind of disapointing."
3,Not quite,"Not quite what I expected after the brilliant Yeild. Many of the songs sound awkwardly produced, drums muted and vocals which just don't sound as great as in the past. Don't get me wrong though, many of the songs such as God's Dice, Light Years, Insignificance, and Soon Forgot, are simply irresistable (pun intended, bad joke). I cannot wait to hear these songs live though, this sounds like the perfect live material. Yet the album does not live up to the past wonderous albums Yeild and No Code, so I give it 3 out of 5 stars."
3,skip the first 3 tracks,"this is by no means a great pearl jam album, but if you ignore the first three tracks which sound like some kind of improvised thrashing session they went through to warm up for the rest, binaural is at least pearl jam's best in the last three or four. plenty of range, a few left field interesting bits, good ballsy performances from vedder. by the way, is it just me, or do pearl jam's always sound annoyingly like someone hitting a bunch of garbage can lids?"
3,Doh! Their most frustrating yet,"Pearl Jam are great, but their music just doesn't come together on Binaural. Two standout tunes are the frantic ""God's Dice"" and--saving the best for last--""Fading Away"". The subtler stuff sometimes works (""Nothing as it Seems"") but just meanders at other times (""Light Years""). ""Evacuation"" has to be the most annoying PJ song yet--it's like a stripped-down, more irritating version of ""Do the Evolution"". I still love PJ--but compared to their previous efforts, their latest comes off as a collcetion of B-sides."
3,Another One For The Fans,"There coems a point with all great bands where the music continues to get better (read U2) or it's just more music that only long-time fans really enjoy (Erasure & Depeche Mode), nothing to gain new fans. Pearl Jam has reached this point. I'm a fan from the first album but every new album continuies to sound the same with nothing new and exciting. If you're looking for more of the same exciting sound that made this band a living legend go listen your early albums (or pick some up) but if you're looking for some new entries that are just as good I'd suggest looking for a new band entirely."
2,One Great Track,"After reading the reviews I can tell I'm in the minority when I say Binaural's one great track is Sleight of Hand. It's the only reason to own a copy. The rest of the album I processed long ago and hasn't stuck a bit for constantly coming up short. Sleight of Hand is a bruised and haunted masterpiece.As far as the debate over which album is the last one worth picking up, for me it's Binaural and Sleight of Hand is the reason. Pearl Jam are way too spotty in quality to revisit continually. I mean a guy only has so much cash to burn.My feeling is that Sleight of Hand is sooo much better than anything else on this album or any of the 3 or 4 preceeding albums that it doesn't click with the usual fan."
4,Still the best!,"There are two breeds of Pearl Jammers. The ones that like TEN and those of us that love PEARL JAM. I, personally think every album has gotten bigger and better. My only regret is that some of the albums are too short. Binaural catches a much more refined and aged Pearl Jam. Congratulations to the best sounding and touring band in the world. If you are unimpressed then buy another copy of TEN and stay in the dark ages. Great talent has to expand and for that I commend them with all my heart. Please keep up the great work...you are the best! Thanx for the ride."
3,Better than Brittney Spears,"Well these Granddads of Grunge are still putting out better music than most today. Its better than all that pop or over-produced rock like Creed or Kid Rock. Not as inspired as some of their earlier stuff, but good listening."
3,(3 1/2) - Pearl Jam experiment a bit,"This isn't probably as good as Ten, Vitalogy, or Yield, yet there are songs here that are real cool. The lead single, ""Nothing As It Seems"" was very mediocre. That's not really as good as songs like ""Light Years"" (second single, enjoyable listen), ""Insignificance"" and others. This is their most experimential to me, though, since it ranges from melodic acoustic, effects on instruments, and is still enjoyable. There isn't too much filler, although there is still some. Worthy buy though. If you like Pearl Jam A LOT, you should like this. This is still better than Vs. and No Code IMO."
3,Pearl Jam strikes again,"Pearl Jam is the greatest band on earth! Yet, this album after 5 listenings just doesn't seem to hold it's own against Yeild and No Code, which I consider their best two albums. The drumming sounds really muted and the vocal mix is just weird, I bet these songs will be great live, but it sounds awkward on the album. Highlights are God's Dice, Insignificance, Light Years, and Soon Forgot, with all the other songs definitely worth listening too. Considering that this is Pearl Jam, I expected more (I think the prodcuer screwed up personally). While this is no Yeild, it is still worthy of owning and makes a fine addition to any collection, I give it 3 stars out of 5."
4,Binaural,"Pearl Jam's sixth studio album is essentially a continuation of where they left off with ""Yield."" Its got raw rockers (e.g. ""grievance"") lilting ballads (""sleight of hand"") and even typical P.J. oddball songs like the solo-Vedder ""Soon Forget."" The first half is more polished than P.J.'s usual raw sound, but the second half is usual ""difficult-to-digest-at-first"" Pearl Jam. The album is not GREAT enough to warrant five stars. However, unlike past Pearl Jam albums, it has no major flaws (e.g. ""bugs"" on Vitalogy). Definitely a strong album which would be enjoyed by fans and non-fans alike."
3,"This CD is ok, but I keep waiting for greatness","I am a huge PJ fan who is stuck in a rut of waiting for another ""great"" album from the band. This album is worth owning and listening to, but for me it will never be a CD that I will want to come back and hear again and again. I think there are a couple of good songs on the CD, but the rest are so diluted with wacky lyrics and melodies that they just are not interesting to me."
1,Not A Ten,Pearl Jam is a great band but this album fails to show this. The production is terrible and the songs are weak. It is there worse release to date.
3,"Ultimately, the worst album of the 7.","Pretty much considered the worst of Pearl Jam's albums, and I would have to agree with that. While its not a horrible album, I'd have to say that almost half of it doesn't do anything for me. While the slow burners and ballads work, (""light years"" ""Nothing as it seems"",""Insignificance"", ""thin air"") other then ""Breakerfall"" and ""Grievance"" none of the other rockers did anything for me. ""Breakerfall"" had that loose ""Do the Evolution"" feel and ""Grievance"" sounded like it was right out VS, but other then those 2, none of the other rock songs had the energy that you'd expect from the creators of Ten, Vs, Vitalogy. 3/5 stars"
3,"GOOD ""OLD"" NEW ALBUM","If Pearl Jam had existed in the late seventies I think this is the record they would have released. It is a really good rock record but it doesn't have that nineties magic that Pearl Jam had. Anyway, I haven't analized the words of every song but I'm sure they are exellent in meaning and impact as they always are."
3,Pearl Jam...Do The Evolution,"Peral Jam is still evolving its soud with Binaural. It isn't Vs or Ten, but it is more intimate like yield. There are some heavier songs...ten like..., but all in all they are mellower. It has taken me a few spins to try and get used to their post Neil Young era. The disc is an experience, not aout one individual song. Keep that in mind, but make sure you add this disc to your collection if you are a true fan."
5,STUPENDOUS,"Pearl Jam has struck gold. When i first listened to this cd, i thought,""this is great!."" This cd is powered by ""insignificance"" (top 3 best ever by pj) and ""nothing as it seems"" (great slow song). But the good songs do not stop there, there are the soft/hard ballads ""thin air"", and ""light years"" which are wonderful. Starting off the cd is ""breakerfall"", which is pretty heavy and rocking. ""breakerfall"" is close to the same heaviness as number 3 ""evacuation."" (just as great). The Cd finishes out with ""parting ways"", a soft and great song. The others arent as great but its hard to match 7 great songs. The others arent terrible, just arent as good. Buy this cd as soon as you can."
3,not their best,"While Pearl Jam continues to be in a category all their own and far superior to today's ""popular"" artists, this album falls short of the standard set by previous works. With each listen, this album is growing on me, but it doesn't come close the enraptured awe inspired by Yield or Vs. This album seems to bounce around aimlessly, lacking a smooth flow from rockers to melodies and back. Hopefully this album has allowed the band to work on some ""B"" songs they've been needing to get out of their system so they can put together another 5-star effort next... Unless you're a rabid ""Pearl Jam can do no wrong"" fan or collecting their complete discography, I don't think you'll miss anything by not buying this album."
3,"Is it really ""nothing as it seems""","I must admit, I had high hopes for this album. With Matt Cameron (of Soundgarden) joining the PJ outfit, I expected major improvements to Yield. However it is more of the same from PJ, with some notable exceptions such as ""God's Dice"", ""Nothing as it seems"" and ""Thin air"". PJ may need to consider whether to quit while they are ahead as the band do not seem to be able to reproduce the electricity of Vs, the power of Vitalogy or the magic of No Code. However all is not lost PJ fans as there is still enough here to make you want to buy this, and hope that the next offering will be better."
1,The King has no Clothes,"This album SUCKS!I have listened to it Stoned, Sober, Drunk, Drunk & Stoned, Sober & on a Fast.It Sucks.The Kings have No Clothes.Wake Up!-Domo"
1,The band that just won't go away,"This has to be the most boring album of all time. Right up there with Yield, Riot Act and No Code. I don't know what it's going to take for this band to finally call it quits. They have no talent and their lead singer just mumbles into the microphone -- you can't understand a word he's saying.If you're looking for a fresh sound, you can't go wrong with a band like Creed. They're talented and they have passion for their work -- not like these washed up has-beens. Pearl Jam has no real talent. Warning: this album is horrible. Listen to the song previews and you'll agree with me."
2,another noisy melody free album to shake the lugnuts,"i dont know what it is, but it seems like pearl jam keeps making these albums layered with noise that mix heavy with the whines of eddie vedder. perhaps their goal has been to shake accessibility. they've succeeded."
2,disappointing,"It usually takes a while for me to appreciate each PJ album but this one never came around. The only song I really like on the CD was ""Rival."" It was kind of depressing because I kept listening to the CD waiting to discover something brilliant like I have in the past and it never happened (except for Rival)."
2,A valient effort,"Remember the days when Pearl Jam was good? back in good-ol-days with nirvana and other grunge bands.This was a valient effort from a once good band but thats all it was an effort. I hate to break the news to everyone but Pearl Jam is dead, and this cd ceartainly isn't helping bring them back from the dead.Save your memories of pearl jam, when they were good, and save your Money."
2,Huge disappointment,"Let me preface that I look forward to a PJ album every two years to reaffirm my belief in rock and roll. They haven't ever failed.....until now. Listening to this album made me think the band needed to take 4-5 years off, not do side projects, and use their best ideas for the next record. I was so depressed that I pulled out all my PJ cds(b-sides too) and started ranking songs. I got to 30 something before I could even think about putting something from Binaural on the list. There are some solid songs but nothing that jumps out at you. Experimental(meaning atypical of the PJ sound) songs that have worked really well in the past(Spin the Black Circle, Do the Evolution come to mind) fail miserably here(Evacuation, Grievance). Overall this album is a huge disappointment when judged against their former body of work. Don't know how someone could give this album five stars. Seems extremely optimistic and forgiving at best. Patently stupid at the worst."
4,HAVE YOU HEARD...,"This CD doesn't have hits you've heard on your radio, and doesn't have as much up-front attraction as an album like ""Ten"". But, if you give it some time to grow on you, it'll be your number one pick long term. Through the entire album the songs are so musical, rocky, and real."
2,what happend?,"what happend to the old pearl jam? this cd is pretty boring. there's no juming around on the cd. tracks 5 and 6 or good even without the wildness, but they lost it,"
1,I can't believe this is Pearl Jam...,"How do I begin? First off, Pearl Jam is my favorite band and I love every one of their CD's...up until this one. Pearl Jam's last album ""Yield"" was arguably the best one they have made. I had such high expectations for this album, but I bought it the first day it came out...and I am so dissapointed. I just can't believe that this is the same band that has just made the 5 best rock albums of the decade (Ten, Vs., Vitalogy, No Code, Yield)...it shocks me how fast a band really can go down hill. Their is not even one notable good song on this album...it's all easily forgettable. Their last two albums (No Code, Yield) were Pearl Jam's best yet, and then they make this. I was so sure that they were just going to keep getting better like they always have...but I was wrong. Pearl Jam has always been my favorite band, and they still are, but this just proves that their best days are behind them...although their best days were not so long ago..."
2,Self indulgent and disappointing,"I've purchased most of the Pearl Jam catalog, and I've got to say this one is a disappointment. There are some good songs here, but there are also some that just aren't interesting enough to keep me away from my CD player's skip button. They just seem so wrapped up in making artistic and meaningful songs that they're missing the fact that they aren't any FUN. There's nothing wrong with being deep, but sometimes you need to break a sweat and jump around a little. Too many of these songs lie there like a beached sea creature."
1,This is not Pearl Jam.,"Its very simple....this is not PJ. I dont know who this is. Fans will try to defend this by saying things such as"" they're growing"" or ""not afraid to break barriers"" or other silly excuses. Simple put...this stinks. I will grant you that I cannot compare this to another sound I've heard...maybe some remote Pink Floyd, with a touch of the Who before they were good. For me the real test to any piece of music is this:When your driving on the highway, and a tune comes on.....you want to turn up the volume. Its that simple. And this album, all I want to do is press mute!"
5,The bonus tracks are,It is a second disk with Footsteps and Betterman Live from the bridgeschool benefit concert.
3,"3,5 stars",Its a nice album but not so good as their previous. WE have some great songs like Thin Air - Breakerfall and the really amazing song Nothing as it seems. But the rest songs are bad or too average. I guess if you are a huge fan you will already have this album but if you are new check Ten - Vs _ Vitalogy and then you can decide for the rest buying s. Its a little bit risky but you will find good songs in every album.
5,Binaural,Great album. Anybody who has doubted Pearl Jam since Vitalogy will have their faith restored.
5,Great cd,"At first listen, i wasn't incredibly impressed, the melodies seemed initially undiscernable... however, after my second or third listen the cd really unfolds. This is a superb cd, if you give it a chance. PJ isn't afraid to morph to different styles, whether the mainstream follows or not."
2,pearl jam misses the mark,"I really had high hopes for this cd. After being disappointed with No code, Yeild was a major improvement. I figured that this latest release from Pearl Jam would be even better. I was wrong. Out of 13 songs, I can honestly say that only about 4 or 5 have any kind of hook or melody to them. ""God's Dice"" and ""Evacuation"" are utterly pointless! However,this album does have some moments of genius. The songs ""Light Years"" ""Nothing as it Seems"" ""Thin Air"" and ""Insignificance"" Are excellent, but everything else is nothing but filler. I will always be a Pearl Jam fan and I will always buy their music, but this cd is a little hard to swallow."
1,This is NOT a vinyl record!,"This was listed as being a vinyl record yet it was not. Clearly needs to be recategorized. Also, the cd did not have a booklet. Super crappy sale from a company that clearly does not care!"
4,overrated but still good,"very good album, very strong tracks with great inspiration and good ideas, so much rock and poetry :) PEARL JAM... what else?!"
1,hugely disappointed,thanks ea-pty for the heads up about the rootkit trojan horse ... I dont plan on buying ANYTHING from Sony Music again!I am very disappointed in Santana for letting this happen ..
2,More of the same?,"When I first heard Supernatural I immediately knew it was going to be a classic. Then, Shamman came and, although good music, it turned out to be a little boring. You never know with Santana so I was eagerly awaiting what the master himself was conjuring for a new album. ""All That I Am"" came and, as an old Santana fan for over 30 years, I went ahead, without reading the reviews, and bought it. The album pleasurably starts with a a-la-Santeria song. Nothing better to commence an album moyubando the Orishas. But then, it goes downhill with pop-rock radio music. Why does it have to be that way? I still have hopes that Santana will surprise all of us with his next album. He needs to do it so he can reconnect with his musical roots."
1,Retread,"It's copy protected so it cannot be ripped onto my IPOD in superior sound quality. On top of that, the sound is poor - poorly recorded.It's the record company formula and the artist seems to be buying into it (along with the copy protection). It certainly is NOT anything from 68-78. To each his own. I'm returning it as well tomorrow."
1,CD COPY PROTECTION SUCKS BIG TIME!!,"I just got this CD and nowhere are you pre-warned about the COPY PROTECTION all over this CD. Who cares about the music at this point. IPOD is not a destination, MP3 ripping is inhibited. You may get it ripped but the output file will sound like trash. You can copy it to your PC's hard disk but there it sits and requires keys to run. No wonder SONY is having financial problems. I'll return this tomorrow. AVOID THIS CD and let ARISTA know how you feel."
1,Content Protected,Hey I found a really great way to bypass the content protection on these CD's. Open your favorite bittorrent client and download the mp3's directly. This will eliminate any trouble you have with the copy-protection mechanism. Thanks!
2,"""Pop"" goes Santana!!!","All the CD writing stuff aside, let's concentrate on the music. Can you say take a good thing too far? Supernatural was really good. Shamam was OK, but trending down. Now 'pop' goes Santana. What a horrible bunch of rubbish. The songs with his band are OK, but nothing really new. The duet with Stephen Tyler is the most restrained I've ever heard him. The instrumental with Robert Randolph and Kirk Hammet is good, but way too short and it fades out at the end! Los Lonely Boys add something, which saves it from one star. But all this bubblegum, teenybopper pop er' K-rap can go. Don't buy it. You can have mine!"
1,Contains SunnComm MediaMax Spyware,"Strongly recommend not buying. A couple of reviewers below stated that this CD does not contain the XCP rootkit. While they are technically correct this CD DOES CONTAIN the Sony/SunnComm MediaMax software that has been proven to be a big security risk also. The software installs even if one rejects the EULA; the software goes on to install regardless. For details see Professor Alex Halderman's website at Princeton University, ""Not Again! Uninstaller for Other Sony DRM Also Opens Huge Security Hole"" at ""www.freedom-to-tinker.com""."
1,The dangers of copy protected CDs!,"Not only is this a mediocre Santana CD (Carlos with a bunch of trendy guests for big sales!), it is loaded with copy protection software. I gritted my teeth when I learned that I could NOT rip this CD directly into iTunes for my iPod. Copy protection limits and lessens the conumer experience; a huge backlash has already started, causing CD sales to slide even further. Why doesn't Sony/BMG get it? Copy protected CDs are terrible and you must avoid this CD!"
5,SANATANA ROCKS!,"This is an amazing CD! Santana has gathered together another stellar line-up, but the true stars are Carlos and his guitar! CHeck out ""Trinity"", an instrumental featuring Santana, Metallica guitarist Kirk Hammett and guitar virtuoso Robert Randolph! It's amazing!And for those griping about the copy-protection - get over it! It plainly says CONTENT PROTECTED in the upper left corner of the front of the CD!"
1,Not all that he is.,"I remember way back when Santana was a band. There were actuall members of the group. Santana has, over the course of years, turned itself from a highly progressive and original band, to a solo guitarist who changes the line-up of the band way too often. Is there a Santana band anymore? Last time I checked, Carlos is the only one that comes out in commercials, liner notes, ads, photos, etc. This album is the third, and hopefully the last, in a series of Carlos Santana's collaborations with other artists. Only four, (FOUR!) songs out of the whole album is Santana by itself. The rest is Carlos Santana playing with other groups. The only good song (which is actually a mediocre song at best) is the first one, Hermes.Santana has often had albums in 3's. Their first 3, then the 3 jazz fusion albums, then the 3 ""Back to Basics"" albums (Amigos, Festival, and Moonflower). Hopefully, All That I Am is the end of a trilogy of commercial sell-out albums."
1,"Santana, All That I Am","Sorry, I was so disappointed! It was a bore, Let down like a kid on Christmas day!"
1,"Santana is good but the CD is crap, its not a proper CD as u expect...","Santana is good but the CD is crap, its not a proper CD as u expect...You can't make FLAC file in order to play on your portable music player, if you use the copy feature which comes with this CD - it will copy the crappy .wma version.Avoid buying this disc."
2,"Ok, but not anywhere near as good as last 2","Something was missing from this one, and I don't quite know what. Oh well, you can't always produce a smash hit."
2,"Ugh, Santana","""All That I Am"" is not all the I hope to expect, well quite frankly I would think he would retire instead keep trying to release more and more albums. ""Supernatural"" was a great album but as all great albums are extremely hard to mimic or beat and in this Santana isn't able to that.Yeah, I will admit there are a few good songs on here such as ""I'm feeling you"" which is the only reason I gave this album a 2, also ""Twisted"" and ""Cry Baby Cry""."
2,Disappointing - never thought I would say that,"Like a couple of other reviewers, I have everything that Santana has ever done, and have seen the band live a million times.I hate to say this, but the album is a good cure for insomnia. Carlos, what were you thinking?""All that I am"" is messy, with few periods of great guitar work and a wonderful percussion section way under utilized, which has always been the basis of great Santana music in the past.Performances by guest vocalists are mediocre at best.Carlos, you owe it to your loyal fans to create an album with just you and your band of great musicians. Lighten up on the vocals, play more instrumental stuff, and show the World why Santana is second to none in musical ability.By the way, Caravanserai is my favourite."
1,This CD is Worthless!,The copy right police have gone way too far! I have never illegally downloaded or copied any type of media. This CD will not even let you download it to an IPOD or any other MP3 player. I don't even own a CD player. I buy my music and download it to my IPOD. There should be a to the point warning about the paranoia police and the uselessness of this CD! I am the one that has been ripped off here! I will never buy or support any of the artists envolved with this crookery ever again!
1,"I wanted the love, but not the STD","You'll be surprised when you put this CD in your computer. It does warn you that it's about to install software on your computer, an attempt at copyright protection. When I declined to have it install this, the computer spit out the CD.A recent article describes how the anti-piracy software opens your computer to hackers. Check it out here: http://blogs.washingtonpost.com/securityfix/2005/11/researcher_sony.htmlThe music's fine if you can listen to it without installing the software, though it's not Supernatural. I've been a fan of Santana's for years and appreciated his message of harmony, but this anti-piracy riff seems more like an STD than love."
1,Don't buy non-standard CD's,"This disc does not comply with the ""Red Book"" standard for ""Compact Disc Digital Audio"", of which Sony was a co-author. These standards were developed so that media and devices could be developed independently of each other, and still ""play nice"" with one another. Sony has decided, on it's own accord, to violate the standard in order to advance their own anti-consumer agenda.Be forwarned...the technology used by Sony on this disc requires anyone who wants to listen to this disc on their Windows computer to install Sony's special malware software, which cannot be removed by the owner of the computer system. In otherwords, Sony hijacks a portion of your computer to play their product. Personally, I think that _I_ should be in control of my own computer system, and that my computer system should not have control over ME.Think before you buy."
1,VIRUS ALERT!!! DANGER!!,"This CD contains a virus that infects core Windows components and cannot be removed without reformating your hard drive!It is safe to play on a CD player but DO NOT PUT THIS DISC IN YOUR COMPUTER!Too bad, its a great record."
1,Warning: This CD Prevents Fair Use & Is Potentially Dangerous,"Do not purchase this CD. If you haven't heard already, Sony BMG has included on this CD - in the name of copyright protection - ""a flawed and overreaching computer program ... [that] has created serious security, privacy and consumer protection problems"" for customers who try to play it on their PC. See http://www.eff.org/IP/DRM/Sony-BMG/ for more information. In the meantime, avoid this CD until Sony BMG issues a standard CD without this hindrance or Carlos finds a better label. Another problem with this CD is that the so-called ""copyright protection"" steps over the line by preventing paying customers from having fair access to the music by copying it to their iPods. Note to Amazon: You really should not be carrying such a dangerous and consumer-unfriendly item. Please send a message to Sony BMG by pulling it from your shelf until this egregious problem is corrected."
1,"If you truly love Santana, don't buy this album and stick with the olders..","Although I am a HUGE fan of Santana, this album sucks BIG TIME and I am really pissed for wasting money on a ""below average quality collaboration"" album.When I want to listen to Santana, I want to listen to Santana, not a scramble of duets where NOISE, not music is the main result.And those who think this album is good, go listen previous albums of Santana then you will realize THAT WAS THE REAL SANTANA.This album is a HUGE step back in Santana production and in its musical journey. I could barely ""feel"" his ""musical signature"" (as in his guitar) from the rest, where the rest is a ""pathetic"" mixture of the ""present"" cool singers/whatever...Sorry, as much as I love Santana, I was and am ashamed to have spent even just 17 dollars (canadian) for an album that went straight into my closet, labeled ""LOSER"".Save your money and your love for Santana, sticking with his better, previous albums."
5,All That I Am - Sure to please,"I knew it would be good, but I was really shocked at HOW good it was. It's a rare thing nowadays - that first listen when you just go ""Wha...What was that???!!! Yes its that good. Copyright protection mumbo jumbo aside, Carlos has once again proved that old phrase ""3rd times a charm"" - and it is. Steven Tyler sound as great as ever - you even get his signature scream on ""Just Feel Better"". Though widely unknown, Anthony Hamilton fits in perfectly among the roster of stars. ""Twisted"" featuring Hamilton sounds like it was written during the soul drenched 70's. And then for all you guitar freaks - you get a triple dose of sweet distortion on ""Trinity"" with Kirk Hammett, and pedal steel wiz, Robert Randolph.This new record will please anybody. Now if only they'll release it on vinyl!!!"
1,"All That I Am reminds me of one of those ""NOW"" compilation cds.","I was reading most of the five star reviews--each reviewer sounding like they barely discovered Santana three albums ago. Supernatural was good, but trust me, folks, you ain't heard nothing yet if you haven't heard the rest of his catalog. I grew up on Santana's music, all of it, not just his greatest hits, but everything: Santana, Abraxas, Santana III, Caravanserai, Welcome, Borboletta, Lotus, Marathon, Zebop, Blues For Salvador, Milagro, this, yes, all of this is what defines the Santana sound for me. Sorry to say, but All That I Am lacks the heart and the focus of the great albums I just mentioned. I miss that Santana. Forget record sales and cool colaborations, give me music."
2,ONly one intriguing song but only because its funny.,BOOM BOOM man this album doesnt go well. Well i may point out first this album is completely different from the good old santana rap where did u go wrong carlos. srry but the only funny song is track number 4 where it goes BOOMBOOMBOOM. It makes me laugh especially when the guy raps cause he says like a bagel cut the bagel. HAHA but really if u want only one good song then this for you but other than that buy some good old santana like black magic woman. I LIKE THT SONG
1,it's a pity Sony is so determined to abuse customers,"I am a long time Santana fan and have many of their albums/cd's including Santana's most recent duet cd's. But - since I am best advised not to let this purposely virus infected piece of optical media anywhere near any of my computers, I don't see why I should purchase it. And I will not! I have plenty of other music to listen to. If Santana wants to sell cd's - he needs to migrate to a label that actually wants customers. Nice going, Sony."
1,I will not buy this copy-protected product,Thank you for informing me beforehand that this product is copy-protected and won't play on all machines. I will save my money and not purchase this product. SONY take note: you have lost this customer with your arrogant contempt for the public who purchase your products.
2,"good cd, won't play on my laptop anymore!","while certainly not Santana's best cd, the copywrite protection thing is a nightmare. I ""installed"" (not by my choice) this on my laptop to listen to it and it worked the first day, but never again. what a nightmare. I don't have any interest in watching anything on a music cd (they should really offer different versions so people can choose) so the software included was not only worthless but a serious problem. I was going to buy 2 more copies for people for christmas presents but I wouldn't do this to them. Maybe they can just download the songs from applemusic. geez, i won't ever buy another cd like this and frankly, i'd like my money back or to get one that doesn't do this garbage!"
1,WARNING! Sony wants to trash your PC,"Do NOT purchase this, or any other Sony CD which Amazon has helpfully marked ""CONTENT / COPY PROTECTED"" if you plan to attempt to play this back (let alone rip a copy) on your Windows computer.See the customer reviews for the Van Zant Brothers CD here on Amazon, or search for David Berlind's blog entry from November 1 on ZDNet and Molly Wood's November 3 column on CNet for more details.One more thing: If you're reading this too late, do NOT try to remove this malware yourself, unless you are extremely tech savvy. It will kill your CD drive."
1,Sony Root Kiet,"I was going to get this for my dad for X-mass, but sorry Sony not going to get. You lost out on my money because I am not going to give my father a virus. Guess I will get the next CD on his list."
1,I wish I could hear it!,"I CAN'T BEIEVE IT - SAME CRAP I FOUND MY ""LAST"" CHRIS BOTTI - IT DOES NOT PLAY. IT MAY BE OK IN MY CD PLAYER IN MY TRUCKNO RESPONSE FROM WEB HELP; I HAVE THE LATEST VERSION OF WINDOWS MEDIA PLAYER AND DIRECTX SINCE I ONLY HAVE WINDOWS 2000 - MY WORK COMPUTER WHICH I CANNOT UPGRADE, NOT MY PERSONAL COMPUTERLAST DISC I BUY FROM SONY - END OF SUBJECTMAD AS HELLarista is part of sony"
1,Bland AND Copy protected,"When will the record companies realize that people like me want to listen to music on our IPODs? No more copy protected CD's for me. As for ""All That I Am""...this is Santana's 3rd attempt at the ""let's bring in currently popular musicians and have Santana play over middle of the road pop music"". I thought Supernatural was great. Shaman was OK, but enough already. The 3rd attempt isn't nearly as exciting. It doesn't even sound like Santana anymore. His great guitar tones are wasted over sunny throwaway tunes. I want to hear Santana again. Not Bo Bice. Save your money."
1,Great album but ..,"I own almost every album of Santana, a life long fan. I own LP's, Pre recorded cassettes, CDs and DVDs. This is one ablum I WILL NOT BUY with DRM software. Santana why are you doing this to your loyal fans ? We know money is not important to you, so why this ?"
1,"Shameful, Anoyng","As a Santana super fan this album feels so empty, sad and desperate.Supernatural was ok, Shaman,recicable and this one is pure crap.Santana please go back to yourself, Abraxas, Zebop, Inner Secrets, Moon Flower etc... The guitar lines sounds improvised and anoyng on top of this not Santana music, do yourself a favor, don't waste your money and time...Booooo"
5,Santana!,"""I Am Somebody,"" ""Just Feel Better,"" ""Twisted"" and ""Trinity"" are all great tracks. In heavy rotation on my stereo - a new favorite in my house! Go Carlos!"
1,If you use an iPod and a PC forget this CD!,"You cannot transfer music from this CD to iPod if you are using a PC.That alone is enough to turn me off, since that is the only way I listen to music these days. Sorry Santana, I'm not interested enough to even bother although I've been a fan for MANY years. And Sony, well, you confirmed that for this consumer, you just ceased to exist. You installed software on my PC without telling me what it would do, and without informed consent. Your rootkit technology has proven to be very dangerous for consumers, seriously compromising PC security. I currently don't own anything made by Sony, and that is the way it will stay."
3,Decent but Forgettable,"I was looking forward to this album, but after listening to it I realize how old the duets are getting. I like ""I'm Feeling You"" and ""Just Feel Better"" but some of the duet songs are just flat out stupid. I paid for a Santana CD, not a hip hop album. Sanata needs to make his own music from now on and stop with the collaberations, Carlos is starting to sound like a guest on his own CDs. This music just seems far fetched and out of place. That Santana tracks are good but overall I was disappointed with All That I Am. Avoid it unless you are an avid Santana fan, this album is not for everyone."
1,About the cover,"Has anyone notice that this cover looks alot like william hung""s cd cover. Of course it is not the same colors and all but santana is cherring and has his hand up in the air like that hung cover and there is people in the background. At This point Willam Hung is the more original artist. If that is not a bag on Santana then i do not know what is. The other thing i notice is that clive has people on this cd that have upcoming cds coming out or are on his label. And speaking of american idol why is Bo brice on this that is really lame, he while as well have gotten clay aiken. I cant believe this is the same guy who played with Hendrix, the Who, and joplin at woodstock after hearing this those artist are probaly rolling over in there grave."
1,Copy protection stinks - music great,"Personally I really enjoyed this album very much, though I do think Santana should do some more of his own work, and get away from the 'guest' albums that have become a regular feature. Musical content gets 4* (its enjoyable but not there with his best).The copyright protection stinks, and IMHO is probably illegal in most countries (tantamount to virus infection or at least cyber vandalism - if someone did this to Sony's corporate computers there would be a hell of a stink!). For that reason this CD should get less than 0 stars .... DO NOT BUY IT.Amazon - be brave - refuse to stock these protected albums - it's the only way Sony will learn!My advice - buy the album from iTunes. You get two bonus tracks, it can be burned to CD and then has no copy protection ... so you can transfer them to your MP3 player (or iPod if you are rich and silly)."
1,It is up to you to decide!,"Content/ Copy-Protected CDThis product limits your ability to make multiple digital copies of its content, and you will not be able to play this disc or make copies onto devices not listed as compatible. Content/ copy protected CDs should allow limited burning, as well as ripping into secure Windows Media Audio formats for playback with most compatible media players and portable devices. In rare cases, these CDs may not be compatible with computer CD-ROM players, DVD players, game consoles, or car CD stereos, and often are not transferable to other formats like MP3."
1,Do Not Support The Madness,"I will not buy this, or any other CD, that contains predatory software that makes the buyer vulnerable to spyware, viruses, and other PC problems. Talk about lousy customer service! What is Sony trying to protect? It was proven during the days of cassettes that convenience copying does not hurt the music industry. Those who would pirate the music, large scale, will find a way around the copy protection anyway. We consumers are the only losers."
1,And the music industry can't figure why sales are down,I totally agree with all the negative comments about this release.Quite annoyed that it cannot be played on my P.C. or portable cd player.My copy will end up at the used cd store.
1,Stuff Rootkill,"I broke this piece of junk in half, it did damage to my PC. I dont care about losing the CD. It's the principle!! Release this like a normal CD and I will buy it or I will go to ITunes and download and have freedom with the music. That's after I find a way to get rid of the virus this thing infected my PC with. My computer has since been hacked. Sell me a virus and you can keep it, I will never buy garbage with this kind of software attached again (no matter who the artist)!!"
1,Far from home,"It appears that Carlos Santana's latest outing was created to appeal to the widest audience possible.But now that Santana is an established household name, perhaps he can consider returning to the kind of music that made him so critically acclaimed and accepted.To my mind, Santana's greatest moments were during the Caravanserai-Welcome-Borboletta chapter. It was, indeed, a ground-breaking period in his career. A time when, musically, enlightenment and understatement meant something.Carlos Santana is best when he is experimenting. And he has created a temple of followers that have hung with him over the years. But, with All That I Am, I am lost. And, as a fan, I am truly far from home."
1,Absolute Trash,"Supernatural - Supernatural powers force the beginning of the end of Santana. ""All that I am"" is the death of ""this once upon a time great""! He needs Michelle Branch and co. to sell albums. Sony is showing its defensive strategies in the wake of digital technologies. The title ""All that I am"" is as defensive as it can get suggesting that Carlos Santana can only make this kind of music at this age! The only decent track in this album is Trinity. All others - I'm extremely sorry folks - dont regret spending any amount of money on this later. If you are an old santana fan, forget this one. New folks - check out the Ghost of Santana - you may want to hear the Late Santana after hearing to this."
2,Disappointed,"I LOVE Santana but this CD is not his best. The past two, Shaman and Supernatural, were so good I just about wore them out. This one will be dusty before it gets played again. Santana needs to get back to the scathing guitar riffs. There are some bright moments. The cuts with Michelle Branch and Joss Stone are good. But sadly this CD is way too much rap/hip-hop and merengue. Somewhere along the journey we lost Carlos Santana. Here's hoping the next CD is the real deal. I won't even get into the CD Protection. I'm just glad I found out before I tried to burn an extra copy for the car and screwed up my comnputer."
3,Some really good tracks here...,"This is similar to Santana's last 2 offerings. There are some fine tracks and some forgettable ones. Among the good stuff: Hermes, the track with Los Lonely Boys (a match made in heaven), the one with Anthony Hamilton (heard it last night live on Letterman), and Brown Skin Girl with Bo Bice. This is a very commercial, very savvy, very sellable collection. If they don't get at least 3 top 40 hits out of this, I'll be very surprised."
3,Miss real Santana Magic,"The collabolations with various guests vocalists did not create real Santana magic I wanted. I expected more charged feeling that they feed to each other by playing together. I love the catchy 'Brown Skin Girl' with Bo Bice, 'Just Feel Better' with Steven Tyler, & ""I Don't Wanna Lose Your Love' with Los Lonely Boys. Michelle Branch and Mary J. Blige songs and other Hip-Pop tunes put me off, and it's a shame they come at the beginning. By the time I got to track 11 & 12, I was already bored. I want more fire like Santana & his band had on Webcast on his release party in New York."
2,Disappointing,Repetitious and disappointing for someone who bought all Santana records LP's CDs and DVDs.
1,SANTANA has overextended himself trying to reach everyone.,"Bought the CD, went to the concert, was disappointed at both. There's just not enough Santana in ""All that I am"". Instead, I went back to my own all time favorite ""LOTUS"". It's sad to see so much potential going to waste. It's discouraging to know that the quality of his music is decreasing. I just hope that next time he decides to come up with an album it shows more of what he truly is; A GREAT MUSICIAN, and not a back up guitar player as he seems in this album."
2,Forget about the root kit and focus on the music -- which is only okay,"Santana is like an old oak tree -- some years there's an abundance of acorns, and other years there's a scarcity. This is a lean season, as the music seems more like muzak at times. I don't fault his effort, but the outcomes are not what his hard core fans look for. But like the mighty oak, Santana endures, and there no doubt will be other, more plentiful seasons ahead."
2,Very Tired Format,"If I wanted to hear all these guest stars, I'd buy their stuff. PLEASE make pure Santana music again. Sure, there are a few good songs, but this format is way overdue for the hook. Carlos, if you really are an artist and have enough of a fortune, make music memories that will stand the test of time....like you used to do."
2,The Formula Has Worn Out,"How many times can you endure one of the guest rappers shouting out Carlos Santana is in the room or in the house? More appropriately I think Carlos has left the building when it comes to this recording.All That I Am repeats too much of the formula with Supernatural and Shaman. Supernatural was a classic recording as it adeptly merged Santana's afro-cuban rock roots with the modern touches of several hip hop artists. More importantly most of those songs had well defined hooks. Shaman duplicated some of the efforts from Supernatural but at least broke some new ground with songs like Sideways and the number with Julio Iglesias.All That I Am adds no new flavorings. The songs are mostly forgettable. I Am Somebody has a nice beat and Just Feel Better is fairly memorable. Hermes has a pretty good keyboard passage and Twisted and Brown Skin Girl have their moments too. However, after that the magic started with Supernatural seems to have disappeared. Pass on this one."
1,what is this carlos?,"What can I say about this album of the great Carlos Santana? Sorry Carlos, but....I will say....ugh!!!!!!!! please.....Come back to play with his band!!"
5,How Much is Enough? Pamela York Klainer,"I want the book, but I can't read. I came on, hoping it would be on a CD, but no luck. Is there anyway you can notify me if and when it goes on a CD? Thank you."
5,A Quick Read --- A Huge Impact,"The Art of Client Service makes for an easy and informative resource. It is a great guideline for advertising professionals on both sides of the corporate-agency relationship. Mr. Solomon offers valuable tips for success through humorous, testimonial accounts that make it easy for the reader to quickly get the point. Anyone who has worked in the ad business will quickly identify with each topic and will smile as they remember their own relatable experiences. As an advertising/marketing executive on the client side, I would pass this along to all of my team. It will make them better clients and will underscore the importance of the communication ""process"" that must take place to achieve strategic success."
5,Account executive bible,"I bought a number of copies of the first edition of this book and gave them away to co-workers in the account services business. I looked everywhere for more copies and welcomed the new edition. Well done, Robert! This book is a must for ad agency service people and anyone else who deals with clients."
3,Do not buy if ..,.. You have tasted client service before. I found this book to be very basic. I have been on client cervicing side before and didn't find anything interesting to note.I would rather read a book which has all that this book has and much more.Not a great buy !
5,Prescriptive advice for creating strong client relationships,"In addition to sage, prescriptive advice, Robert demonstrates the importance of checking oneself with a good, hard look in the mirror -- to learn lessons, and strive for greatness in the craft of managing client relationships. Because this book is about how to interact with people, assume responsibility, and communicate important information, the personal advantage from reading ""The Art of Client Service"" could last an entire career."
4,A Must Read,"If you are in the world of advertising/marketing, no matter if you are on the account service side or creative this should be required reading.A simple quick read with timeless ideas and advice."
3,Good But Too Common Sense,"When I bought this book, I envisioned a more advanced guide into account management. Specifically, what to do in certain situations and with various types of clients. Essentially, this is an entry level book on account management. I did find some of the examples/ideas to be helpful as they are the type of information that is simple but easy to forget. Additionally, I appreciate the author's integrity and his belief that his primary job is to facillitate effective advertising. But there is definately a place for a more advanced book on this this topic."
4,"Easy read, full of real world examples","A lot of these books where each chapter is a career tip or hint are mundane to read and only express the author's opinion on why the theory is applicable for others. This read was quick, easy, and even fun. The author gives anecdotes of things that actually have happened to him throughout his career, and the tone is casual and not overbearing."
5,this cd rocks!,"this is the best cd ever! I love NineDays. I fell in love with absolutly, and really wanted the cd. After I got it, I was amazed at how good their other songs are. At this very moment, I'm litsening to 'the madding crowd', and loving it as I always will!"
4,A Good CD to buy...,"This CD is wonderful ! The songs on this CD are really realistic about real life, no mushy stuff ^.^"
4,Funky Songs,"This CD rocks. Back to me, absolutely and If I Am are my favorites, but the whole CD is good. You cant compare them to any other band, but if you like this CD, you will definetely like Matchbox20, Vertical Horizon, Three Doors Down, Goo Goo Dolls, and all the other bands similar to this one. Buy this CD because it is NOT a waste of money and it is totally worth it...you may even wear out your copy! Buy it!!!"
4,A Thinking Boys Band Turns It Out & On,"This is the story of a band whose debut single, ""Absolutely (Story of a Girl),"", heard on TV's Dawson's Creek, has become a sleeper hit. With its chunky hooks and irresistible, sing-along, stop-and-start chorus (""And while she looks so sad in photographs/ I absolutely love her/ when she smiles""), the song has sparked buzz about an obscure non-boy band from Long Island.Five guys with no use for ward-robe consultants or choreographers, Nine Days boasts two highly talented singer-songwriter-guitarists. John Hampson, 28, author of ""Absolutely"" (as well as the group's second single, ""If I Am,"" a catchy but more pedestrian, Oasis-like power ballad), shares co-frontman duties with fellow auteur Brian Desveaux, 29, who wrote ""Bob Dylan,"" an homage that dares to sample the master's ""It's All Over Now, Baby Blue.""With a literate muse and an added layer of sound provided by Jeremy Dean's Hammond organ, Nine Days looks to be around a good deal longer."
1,a big disappointment,"I had high hopes for this cd, but unfortunitely it was a huge disappointment. My main complaint, is that all the songs basicly sound the same. they have One Hit Wonder written all over them."
1,Voices mediocre at best.,"Well, I bought this CD because I liked the Absolutely track and because a number of people reviewed the CD and said this was not the best track on the CD. Well - it is the best. The vocals on this CD leave very much to be desired. Half the time the person singing is just enough off key to rattle your teeth as my old vocal coach used to say. Definitely NOT worth the money. I will never buy a CD from these guys again - everything sounds the same. I do not recommend this CD at all."
1,THIS IS A TERRIBLE ALBUM,"if you're considering buying this album i'd say you'd probably enjoy it, but if you have any respect for yourself and the people around you please forget it and buy something less terrible."
1,bummin,"this cd is bad. i really didnt and dont enjoy this CD. If I were you, Id save my money for Christmas. After I listened to this CD, I was was bummin. You will B2."
1,Not worth nine cents,"Hello? What were these artists thinking when they wrote all these songs? I'm sorry but I would rather listen to Mandy Moore than go through the torture I went through listening to this cd. I think I will give this cd away to my worst enemy to avenge myself. The lyrics sounded as if they were written by a bunch of 2 year olds. I'm sorry but how could a girl cry a river? Wouldn't the tears stop coming after about nine days? I wish the dj would stop playing that song all the freakin time. I have even switched radio stations to avoid hearing it; unfortunately, I now listen to country. Please buy this cd for your worst enemy!"
5,Absolutely (Story of a Girl) is only the beginning,"You've probably heard ""Absolutely"" on the radio but, believe me, it doesn't compare to the rest of the album. Especially, ""If I Am"" and ""Bob Dylan"". Buy this CD now...you won't regret it!"
4,better than you might think,"Okay, I'll admit straight off that this is my ""guilty pleasure"" CD; I don't usually go for Top 40 groups. However, I was able to get past the extreme popularity of ""Absolutely"", because this CD, while not startling original in any way, is a cheerful, aurally pleasing piece of work. Don't look to Nine Days for intellectual lyrics or anything, but realize that every song on this album is really catchy, musically well-written, and fun to listen to when you're in the mood for something light. I think that these guys still have a long way to go in terms of being legendary, creative musicians (for instance, ditching the boy-band-esque pictures plastered all over the CD might be a good idea), but they've managed to produce a really nice collection here."
3,Nine Days Fails To Deliver Consistently,"When I first heard ""Absolutely"" on the radio, I thought that it was the best pop/rock song to come around in over a decade. Everything was perfect on that song. So, I bought the CD a few days later, thinking the rest of the CD would be great as well. After numerous full listens, I still think that ""The Madding Crowd"" is one of the most inconsistent records I've listened to this year. There are some real high points (""Absolutely"", ""If I Am"", ""Bob Dylan""), but the majority of the CD doesn't deliver the promise of the first single. Still, considering this album has two of the best pop/rock songs in a very long time (the other being ""If I Am""), it may be worth the money. Just don't expect this CD to blow you away."
5,Judge THIS story by it's cover!,"I know I'm not supposed to be reviewing this CD because I've only heard one song.... Absolutely.... but I just couldn't resist telling the world how cool their sound is.... Their music is like Third Eye Blind or Blink 182 but on a whole other level..... Really groovy.... Cool lyrics, cool beat, fresh vocals... and this is judging form one song.... I bet the rest of the CD is even more awesome..."
5,"Great band, awesome CD!","This band is honestly one of the best groups I have heard in a long time. Every song on this cd is great, and if you liked Absolutely before it got played way too much, then you will love the rest of the album. Some of my personal favorites are ""If I Am"" and ""Bitter"", which is very cynical song about an ex (it's great). This will become one of your most played cds. Buy it today!!"
4,Catchy new rock,"already a major radio hit, ""absolutely(story of a girl)"" is one of the best songs on the cd. admitedly, most of the songs aren't too original, but if you like ""absolutely"" you will love the rest of the cd. songs like ""257 weeks"" and possibly ""bob dylan"" or ""revolve"" are bound to be hits. the album is well put together and well produced, and this band should turn out more hits in the near future."
4,"More Than ""Story""","Pop. That's what this CD is, pure and simple. And, you know, it's a pretty good pop CD.Taking flavors from sounds like Tonic, Stroke 9, and Third Eye Blind, Nine Days achieves a catchy batch of songs. Standouts include ""So Far Away,"" ""If I Am,"" ""End Up Alone,"" ""257 Weeks,"" and ""Revolve."" I didn't buy this CD for ""Absolutely (Story Of A Girl);"" in fact, I can't stand that song, even though it gets stuck in my head whenever I listen to this album. I bought this CD because they were very cool in concert when they opened for 3EB. Not quite the same feel from the studio as they had on stage, but still well worth listening to.Upbeat, positive, and fun."
5,Totally awesome,"The sound produced by NINE DAYS is one that other bands have tried to create. The music itself is gorgeous, and the lyrics add, making it completely amazing."
4,Not too shabby,"OK, to start things off, how can people compare this to Blink 182? Blink 182 is PUNK, this is pop/alternative. They sound NOTHING like Blink 182, unless you are a teenie bopper who has only heard two songs by Blink... then it might sound similar... Listen to Blink's older stuff and tell me that sounds like Nine Days... That said, this band resembles more of Vertical Horizon, 3 Doors Down's more mellow side, matchbox twenty, Third Eye Blind, and poppish bands like that. The lead singer has a higher pitched voice, which can get frustrating at times, but overall, a very nice debut by these guys. Don't just buy it for ""Story of a Girl"", either... You'll be severely disappointed, trust me. Also buy Vertical Horizon, their CD is amazing... and also don't buy that just for ""Everything You Want""."
4,The Madding Crowd- Nine Days,"This was a great CD. The music is very good, consistent without being boring and sounding the same. Each song was interesting on its own, but cohesive with the CD. Although most of the songs were not as well known as their most famous ""Absolutely""- story of a girl song, they were all very good. I would definitely recommend this CD to anyone that enjoys music such as the Fray, We the Kings, Jimmy Eat World, One Republic etc..."
3,A Good First Effort,"This album would've gotten a higher rating were it not for some mediocre songwriting and the song Bob Dylan, which is pretty bad. If you overlook those two aspects, though, the album is pretty good. It's packed with catchy tunes and it includes a wide range of musical styles. If I Am, Wanna Be, and Absolutely (Story of a Girl) are the standout tracks. I know Absolutely fell victim to TV and radio overkill, but I'm not a big MTV watcher or radio listener, so it's still pretty fresh to me.As an example of what I mean by mediocre songwriting, here's a line from the song Wanna Be:""...and I hate to say still I sway brown your eyes gone away...""If anybody can interpret that for me, I'd appreciate it."
3,Are you sure Bryan Adams is not the lead singer?,several tracks have me double checking the credits to see if Bryan Adams name appears. I just can;t get past it. An ok CD.
3,"Good, but lacks greatness","I loved ""Absolutly (Story of a Girl)"" the first few times that I heard it. When I got this Cd, though, it didn't seem as great and got old soon. Although the other songs are ok and complete the Cd, they will never make big hits. I was glad that I bought it, but it isn't one of my favorites."
3,Two Great Songs,"When Nine Days hit the mark, they're truly enjoyable--kind of a mix between Buffalo Tom and Third Eye Blind. Big hooks and great production.Here, that happens twice--on ""So Far Way"" and ""Story of a Girl"".So, if you're a fan of white boy power pop, and two songs is enough to justify the price, go for it, dude."
2,One Hit Wonder For a Reason,"What a bad album. Amazed by the the excellent ""Story of a Girl"" (Strangely abbreviated ""Absolutely""), I decided to check this album out. ACH! This is garbage. There is nothing on this CD worth listening to besides the debut single. the rest of the songs are all dull, lifeless, pointless and similar. It's a shame, too. ""Story of a Girl"" was possibly one of the best singles of last year. Better luck next time, boys."
4,This is a great cd.,"I am a huge fan of this band and have been for a long time coming from there home state i had a chance to hear there indy release stuff and i have to say once fans start to see these guys live there is going to be a huge increase in fan base. i love the vocal quality of both singers,and can't wait to see what they come out with next. The best is yet to come with tracks like ""Bitter"" and ""absolutely"""
4,Cool- even if I don't understand it,"Nine Days rock! If their better in concert then I have to get tickets... I really like this cd. Except maybe for the Bob Dylan song- I didn't quite get that one (probably because I don't listen to Bob Dylan). Story of a girl is the clearest song on the album, and one of the better tracks. However, I also really like a lot of the other songs. The vocals are good and fitting to the songs and music."
5,Don't let Absolutely scare you off!!!! GREAT ALBUM!!!!,"Although many people are turned off by Absolutely and how radio stations have majorly overplayed it, just listen to the rest of the album and you'll see what other people are missing out on. Every song is great and there are no fillers. This CD never comes out of my CD player :) And make sure you go see them live cause you haven't heard anything until you've seen them in concert :)"
5,nine days is my all-time favorite band,"this cd is truly a great cd...don't think twice about getting itif you liked the song ""Story of a Girl"", or ""so far away"" you'll love the rest of the albumn. it's easy to listen to, and fun to sing along with. their voices are beautiful and so are the song lyrics"
5,One excelent CD,"I have had this CD for a while now and I am still lovin it.I bought this CD last summer when the song ""Absoltly(Story Of A Girl)""came out.I thought that I would only like ""Absolutly"",but I was very wrong.Every song on the CD is excelent.Each one was brilliantly written and wonderfully sung.I will never ever get tired of this CD.The stand out tracks are:""So Far Away"",""Bitter"", ""Wanna Be"",""End Up Alone"",and ""If I Am"".Don't ignore this CD,it is excelent."
3,A Solid Debut CD - But Nothing More,"The only good song on the CD is Absolutely (Story of a Girl). The others are very slow-paced and the harmonies are haphazard. I must say that the band has tried very hard to make a good CD, and it does show, but it is not worth the money. If you are buying the CD for Absolutely, don't. Buy the single instead."
3,Prisoner's Self Help,I order this book for my brother and he has tried to use it for situations that he faces while he is incarated. So far he has not had much luck.
5,Best wine stopper ever,I first saw these little beauties at a cabin we were renting in Tennessee and used them and was amazed how tightly they sealed the wine bottle. It's almost sealed as well as the original cork!
5,"Zyliss Bottle Topper, Assorted Colors - Greatest topper ever!",I have been using this style of Zyliss bottle topper for wine for 6 years and they are absolutely great. They work extremely well and do not leak. They make great gifts when giving wine as a gift! I need to pruchase more and cannot find them for sale. I live in a small town and the store that was selling them went out of business. Does anyone know where to find this style of Zyliss bottle toppers for sale?????
1,Do not buy from this company,"Their site said ""in stock"" I chose rush shipping, one week later still no confirmation on delivery. Very unreliable. Do not use them."
5,Fast delivery!,I am very pleased with how quickly this order arrived! I would not hesitate to do business with this company again!
3,Clapboard tool kit,Not as impressive as I thought it would be for the money. Can do better using an exacto knife and old dental tools. Steel wool included in kit can be bought anywhere.
3,Puzzling for a 4th Edition,"Content is detailed and covers a wide variety of relevant topics. However, there are a number of structural flaws which can obstruct comprehension. Some sentences are phrased quite awkwardly, and I found a total of 73 typos in the book throughout my reading."
4,Good cultural coverage,"Good book on the culture, risks, strategic planning issues of being an international manager. Case studies in the end of the chapter give in-depth views of the successful real-life situations. This book was used for a College-level course for juniors and seniors. They seemed to enjoy reading it.The fifth edition was published in 2003. But one of the authors, R. M. Hodgetts passed away in 2001. Therefore, the info contained in this book is not updated."
2,"Biased, but Mirrors U.S. Version","Purchased Book thinking it was the U.S. version of the book, but received the International version (""NOT to be used in the U.S."" according to the cover of the book). To date, the book mirrors the U.S. version exactly page for page, question for question. My only comment would be that the book is biased towards a U.S. view. I thought this was quite strange for an ""International"" management book and the ""International"" version no less. Some sections and stories appear to speak more negatively about other counties and paints the United States in a more positive light. It was my assumption that a book dealing with International subjects would be more objective and state the factual differences and similarities to managing in other countries and cultural differences."
4,Perfect Book from a good Seller,Very Useful Book!!!!. Got it n enjoying now. Nice experience on Amazon. Thanks 2 seller
3,Rod - I love ya.......but???,Here's the best way to explain this. I am a huge Rod fan. I have most of his cd's - everything from the Beck days forward. I liked the first three standards cd's too. But this cd sounds like he showed up - was handed the lyric sheets - sang them once (over bland arrangements) - and then headed off to dinner. Rod - I hope that you tour on this because I will show up and I bet they songs will Rock more live - but this does not rock me plimsoul.
1,What Happened to Rod Stewart?,"I know, I know, he sold out years ago, but I was really surprised that people were reviewing this release. People, the GREAT Rod Stewart (and he was GREAT) left the building years ago, this is another sad cash-grab. Buy some Faces, please, and listen to how fantastic they were, better than even the Stones. After that, Every Picture Tells a Story, Never a Dull Moment; what can you say, the beginning of the end, sure, but magnifigant all the same.Rod Stewart is not the clown he appears to be on his latest recordings; he's an incredible singer, interpreter and thoughtful talent who, I want to believe, has yet another GREAT album in him.Buy and listen to some Faces non-believers, or Jeff Beck Group; you'll understand why Rod deserves his Rep."
2,Where is Rod?,"Where has Rod Stewart gone? This is so bad that I couldn't even finish listening to the CD. I am such a big Rod Stewart fan, but I think his glory days are over. I have had my fill of his remakes at this point. Don't waste your money on this one."
4,Still the Same...Great Rock Classics Of Our Time - Rod Stewart,"If you are a Rod Stewart fan, this CD will not disappoint you. I enjoy his old stuff, the 'old' pop stuff and this, too!"
5,He's still going strong,A great compilation and worth every cent he has not lost he's old style of singing.Service was excellent as usual with sending this album to me ...a really great buy.Dave Morgan
3,Not So Great Rock Classics,"Material very disappointing. If these are Rods' favorites OK, but Classics...I don't think so. Sounds like the whole thing was recorded in an hour and a half. If you're a die-hard Rod fan, then this one should be in your collection. If you're looking for rock classics, this one's a pass."
4,Rod Stewart,I received the new CD of Rod's latest hits and I am thrilled with it!He is one of my favorite singers and it's wonderful to have him sing the Standards. They have lasted all of these years - throughout my parents' time and I have grown up loving them too. It's a great CD!
1,A recidivist...,"Well, Rod is back on the scene of his previous crimes. And crime pays, it seems. Who are the buyers ? A mystery to me. Once Rod had guts, soul and attitude. He was a great entertainer. But he sold his soul for those almighty bucks, and there is no end to greed, it seems. What a pitiful scene to see him fall from grace over and over again. Get the originals instead of those insipid covers. The pinnacle here is to see him cover It's a heartache, the copy of his female soundalike. How low can you go ?Sorry Rod, I loved you before. I can't bear this anymore."
3,Good not great,Thia album is pretty good but some of the songs were too close to the original versions and lack his own style.
2,Just Okay,"A couple of songs were definitely made for Rod Stewart, but was disappointed in a couple of the songs. Even if you are a huge Rod Stewart fan, you may get disappointed."
3,Rod darlin'--back to your own music please~,Not bad. Not great. Not anything that I would play over and over. I love Rod and this is a bit of a disappointment . Truth be told a little drecky.Voice is still magical. But damnit-I wish he would get back to basics again with his OWN music. How 'bout that rocking bluesy devil may care roots rock that first hooked me?
1,Better to get a root canal,"First off, I like Rod Stewart. But this piece of dreck SHOULD be called ""The tape is full, when do I get paid?"". It's fun sometimes to hear a performer at a concert jump into an inspired cover. This is neither inspired, nor at a concert. It's a whole CD of, ""well I need some money and I am too lazy to even add something to a cover song, let alone actually come up with something new."" Bad enough it's all covers, his performance is lifeless, lethargic, and apathetic. Certainly, if I wanted to hear any of these songs, I would reach for the original first. This collection is unnecessary."
4,"Enjoyable, good and careless entertainment","""Rock classics"" are not the case here. The right name would be ""rock ballads"", because there are only ballads.Except for the atrocioulsy ridiculous cover art, the songs here are warm, professionally executed and, yes, next to the originals. What would be the point in changing them a lot? The only real difference that matters here is the voice (because is an album by a vocalist) and, regarding this subject, Rod is singing great.Of course this is an extremely commercial project, designed to play it safe and inspired by the previous success of the ""Great American Songbook"" series, but that is not a sin by itself."
3,New versions of great songs that didn't need to be covered,"A Brief History:In the 60s, I liked Rod the Mod's single Good Morning Little Schoolgirl. He was great when he fronted The Jeff Beck Group and also with Python Lee Jackson as a session singer. Shucks, Maggie May is still one of my favorite songs. In the 70s, he entered the next phase of his career with those pseudo disco sex anthems like Do You Think I'm Sexy and Hotlegs which still make me want to hurl chunks of undigested bile. In the 80's, he teamed up with Jeff Beck again for People Get Ready and I was hoping they would record an entire album together, but things didn't work out. Amazingly, he's had unbelievable success with two CDs of standards. ""Still The Same"" uses the same formula, except these rock classics sound like lounge music to me. What's even worse is that on the CD cover he looks like Tammy Faye Bakker (RIP) on a bad hair day."
2,Disappointing,"Read through all these reviews. Mine? Still the Same.I looked forward to the release of this CD.I love the tunes, Rod has great pipes. Curious where they were when this was recorded.The music is flat, and unimaginative, a sad butchering of some classic rock.Love Hurts is pure pain to hear.The whole thing has that lounge lizard feel.What a waste.As an aside to whoever mixed this; All those little switches, toggles and knobby things on that great huge board in front of you are meant to be adjusted throughout each and every song to enhance listening. Unless having Rod Stewart appear to absent mindedly hum through these songs was your goal. In which case I apologize."
1,How much money do you need?,There is just no reason to make this album. Boring versions of great songs. A whopping 13 tracks! What is this CD like 30 minutes long? Even my mom will find you boring now
1,Rod - Please Retire,Rod -Stop...Please stop.Please stop.Please stop.Please stop.Please stop.Please stop.Please stop.Please stop.Please stop.Please stop.Please...
3,Still the Same...Great Rock Classics Of Our Time,"I love Rod Stewart! But, the title was a bit misleading, there were only a few of his orginal songs on this cd, I should of looked at the song list a little closer, alittle disappointed. Rosa"
4,Loved the CD,I've been a long time follower/admirer of Rod Stewart and found his latest cover of other artists very entertaining. I feel Rod's voice is as strong as ever and absolutely loved this CD!
2,A PERSONAL NOTE TO CLIVE DAVIS & ARNOLD STIEFEL,"NOTE TO CLIVE and ARNIE: Think about the legacy. Think about songs like Maggie May, Every Picture Tells A Store, Scared and Scarred, The Wild Horse, Lost in You, Go Out Dancing, I Was Only Joking, The Killing of Georgie, Mandolin Wind, Italian Girls, Is That the THanks I Get?, Rebel Heart, You're in My Heart, Lady Luck, Every Beat of My Heart, A Night Like This, Stone Cold Sober, Young Turks, Moment of Glory, Dynamite, etc, etc.,,,,You are not doing the public a favor--you are robbing us of one of Rock's best songwriters. You and Rod have enough money. Think quality. Please. I am begging.......Rod doing so-so version of so-so songs is boring and so beneath his talent. This album is well beneath the talent of one Roderick Stewart. GIVE US OUR ROCK STAR BACK!!!!!"
3,Still the Same....Is just not the same.,"I have enjoyed Rod Stewart's music from his days with Faces. However, while his latest rendition of some old favorites, in 'Still the Same' is a plus in the evolution of Rod Stewart, it does not compare with some of the old favorites."
3,"Stretching it with ""Classics of Rock"" - Reyna Sion, critic at large - Riverdale, New York","This review is going to be short but maybe not so sweet. Rod, I easily fit into the category of ""one of your biggest fans"". You are such a high energy performer and this usually comes through on the CDs you've made. But and this is a big but, you sound bored and therefore you become boring to those of us listening to this. The selection of songs is ok, but nothing great, and does not do justice to some of your singing qualities. Please, don't even think of making a second volume of this."
3,Great songs,"I enjoyed the selections on this CD, but prefer the original artists. I like his other CD's much better of the old classics."
5,Excellent Versions of Excellent Songs,"I for one think this is really fantastic. He was so successful with the Great American Songbook, why not explore great american rock songs!!!!I do understand the argument of ""Why doesn't he release some new material"" but when you get to be his age not many people want to hear new material by artists like him, personally I would but I guess that is not the general thought pattern. Well Done Rod excellent collection of songs!!!"
5,STILL A FAN,THANK YOU MR. STEWART FOR THIS WONDERFUL CD. I'VE BEEN YOUR FAN FOR OVER 30 YEARS AND YOU KEEP ME SINGING AND DANCING. KEEP GOING.......AND GOING.........YOU ROCK!!!
1,Boring and Disgusting!,Boring CD and doesn't derserve your money. I think even my mother will finding this CD boring (she is 65). Rod you should retire and do something more useful. This CD is TERRIBLE...
2,The Passion is Gone,"Oh, Rod, Rod, whatever happened to that throaty, rockin' passion you used to lavish on much of your music? Hey, babe, I'm older'n you, but I've still got it! The problem with this CD is that some sound engineer or orchestrator set the metronome at this slow, drousy tempo -- and left the darn thing on the same speed for the entire CD! You're a musician -- didn't you notice? In ancient times I think they called it ""Gregorian Chant."" I bought this CD because some of my favorite old songs were on it en masse, so I thought, wow, that's cool, but you sing them like they were all Fifties ballads. I can understand why ""I'll Stand By You"" is a dirge, but why in heck would you not stomp the floor with ""Still the Same"" and ""It's a Heartache""? I gave you two stars, one for the memories and one for the pity."
2,Rod moves up several music generations,"Fresh from his 4 American Songbook series, he returns with what is the beginning of another series??? In this case, we hope not. Everyone has their own interpretation of what a classic tune is but in this case (at least as far as I'm concerned) few of these qualify. On the upside, he kicks off with 'Have You Ever Seen The Rain'(A CCR Song) which suits his gravelly voice as does 'It's A Heartbreak'(A Bonnie Tyler origional). He does a reasonable job on the Cat Steven's 'Father & Son'. As for the rest, some of these 'classics' I've never heard before. Maybe he should have stuck with American Songbook tunes."
1,kidnapping/identity theft reported,"rod stewart--singer/songwriter of many great songs as a member of the faces and as a solo artist--has been kidnapped and a sellout stand in is using his name for profit. don't be fooled. the real rod stewart wouldn't continue to release this cheese.buy the faces, every picture or never a dull moment. you'll find many a dull moment with this tripe."
2,Would rather hear the original artists on these songs,"Rod Stewart is by far one of the best rock male vocalists in my book. However, re-doing these ""classics"" just doesn't gel with me. For some reason, they all sound alike with hardly any variation. If I had to pick one good track, it would have to be ""If Not For You"", originally done by George Harrison (speaking of which, check out Olivia Newton John's remake of this song-much better than Rod's). Perhaps Rod should have tried some original rock tunes instead (but then they wouldn't be classics, now right?). I love all of these songs performed by the original artists. I think Rod could have done these songs justice...he has a great voice to pull it off, but the arrangements are stale in my opinion. I almost pre-purchased the CD, but glad I waited until after hearing the samples. I will not be buying this one...sorry!"
3,Major Talent Wasted...Again,"There was a time when Rod Stewart actually WROTE great rock classics of our time, and the limp performances of jukebox favourites featured on this album sound half-hearted at best, as though many were first-time run-throughs the artist recorded out of contractual obligation rather than any heartfelt personal connection to the songs themselves. What covers can fans look forward to on Rod's next album? ""Lady in Red?"" ""My Heart Will Go On?"" Personally, I'm hoping for the ""Theme from Ghostbusters..."""
2,"Uh...""Wake up, Roderick, I think we got something to say to you...""","So Rod Stewart is ""returning to rock,"" eh? That, ah, ""selection"" he picked out to ""perform"" is only marginally above ""acts"" like ""The Little River Band,"" ""The Starland Vocal Band,"" or Leo Sayer. Guess those mighty vocal cords just gave up while he was pimping himself out, ""doing"" slimy ""rat pack"" material. But, hey...he's past 60, now, I guess we can't expect him to really Rock and Roll anymore..."
5,THE BEST BY THE VOICE.,"Rod Stewart and Clive Davis has chosen a bunch of great 70s songs, some expected (Love Hurts, It's a Heartache, Have You Ever Seen The Rain), some almost forgotten (Still The Same, Crazy Love, the masterpieces Day After Day and If Not For You), and given them the usual Stewart touch that proved so musically and commercially successful for 30s and 40s songs. Old Stewart fans may missed the times when he was a rock superstar, but his re-readings of classic songs has reinvented him in this century when most people thought he was way down forever."
1,OH MY GOD THIS IS S-O B-A-D,"I had high hopes for this disc - after the American Songbook debacles, which gave Rod the chance to sing songs he had no business singing to talk show audiences around the coutnry, I thought GREAT! The scottish rooster is going to get down by singing rock classics of OUR TIME! COOL! Just look at the titles - If Not For You, off of All Things Must Pass is 36 frickin' years old!!! These are old songs, sung by an old guy, for an old audience. They sound old. Rod sounds old. This is an act of marketing desperation. What comes next? Rod Stewart sings the Rogers & Hammerstein songbook??? Don't buy this disc - buy the Rhino Faces box set instead and hear 70s music sung by Rod at his peak. 'xcuse me while I kiss my metamusil."
3,At least he's rockin' again,"This record by no means is the worst record that Rod Stewart has ever done, however, I do wish he would get back to writing his own songs and singing rock and roll the way he used to. Records such as Footloose and Fancy Free are all but a memory for some of us and for younger listeners--they have no clue to just what a wonderful storyteller Rod Stewart really is because many only know him from his recent Song Book series of cds. In saying all of that, I'm not a big Rod fan, my sister is. I got the cd for her, and I actually do like a few of the songs he covers. I love his version of ""It's a Heartache"" and ""Everything I own"". I think this will be a top seller for Rod, but I do prefer it when he sings his own music."
2,More bilge from another over-rated rocker!,"One can only wonder how someone with so little talent could sell so many records for so many years! First of all, the title itself is ludicrous, given that ""Rock Classic"" itself is practically an oxymoron. If listening to a craggy voice singing mediocre tunes is anyone's idea of a good time, then this is a top competitor, given thousands of other such drek out there! Like many other aging rockers,this performer has made a feeble attempt to sing the real ""American Classics"" Songbooks, but that was even worse! However, 2 Stars for still recording, and for lassoing all those fans out there to line his pocket, and the pockets of everyone involved in this drivel! That is a major achievement!"
1,Return? I think not.,"When I heard Rod was returning to Rock I was anxious to hear his new material. First off this isn't new and for the most part it isn't even rock. The album is full of tired old remakes that barely showcase the wonderful voice Rod has. He is capable of so much more. The songs are mostly ballads and love songs. To title this cd ""classic rock songs"" is wrong and very misleading. If you need a shot of good classic rock get the new Bob Seger cd ""Face The Promise"". It's a much more worthy purchase."
1,Doo doo caca please retire now Rod.,"Ok, he's done some good covers in the past, but he's phoning it in from the side of the pool this time to add to his retirement nest egg. It's not too late to start over Rod and do something else if you're not busy counting your retirement fund money. I hope this isn't another series of albums. Maybe a nice Lawrece Welk themed CD would work better. Blecch."
4,I kept changing my mind...,"When I heard Rod Stewart promoting his album, I very much wanted to add it to my collection. I pre-ordered it, but it didn't ship right away which gave me time to read the reviews. When I saw that there were so many negative reviews, I began to change my mind. My cd wasn't set to ship for about a week so I'd check the reviews every day. Finally, I changed my mind & canceled the order. I don't like to waste money. When I saw it at a local retail store for the lowest price ever, I decided to purchase it. I'm not sorry that I spent my hard earned money on it. I love this cd. I love Rod's gravelly voice & I think he did a great job on all the songs. They might not be 'great rock classics of our time' but the songs suit his voice. For the life of me, I don't understand all the negative comments. If you're a Rod Stewart fan, you'll love this cd."
2,ROD...YOU LOST YOUR BALLS SIR!,"Rod needs to take a listen to the Faces ""A Nod is as good as a wink"" or his own ""Gasoline Alley"" to remind him that he once had deep authentic soul and heartfelt grit and he was once a hard core rock n' roller.The money, success, cars, mansions, top 20 Disco hits, and the exploitation of big band which never suited his artistic abilties to begin with have crushed his rock n' roll heart.This album here is Rod does rock ala bad Vegas style meaning there's routine by the numbers uninspired spineless rock n' roll bull.Do the right thing and buy Faces ""A nod is as good as a wink"" to hear Rod when he was ""Rod the MOD"" and skip this platter of SELL OUT.CHEERS!STRATCAT (O.F.)"
1,A truly awful album,"So sad that a once great artist has sunk to recording Karaoke albums with a band that sounds like it was picked up Republican fund-raiser barbecue. I was once a huge Rod fan (unfortunately pre-Atlantic Crossing). I know he can do better - if you want to hear the evidence go listen to Sweet Little Rock and Roller off of ""Smiler"". Rod here is what you do - get on a plane, come back to England bring along Rick Rubin and get Ron Wood out of rehab, lock yourself away for a year and produce something to regain your reputation and respect."
2,Captain Kidd,"Not the Sea Hawk or Captain Blood by any means,but still enjoyable.With a cast like Laughton,Carradine and Scott it can't be too bad.Historicaly not very accurate and a little hokey.But then again it doesn't claim to be factual.Laughton is great as the scheaming Kidd and Scott as the hero is his usually heroic self.If you are a fan of this type of film,and i am,you will enjoy this picture."
3,ROAN EDITION REVIEW!!!!!,"The low rating reflects the very poor job Roan did on this film. This was advertised as being from a 35mm original print. To begin with it was a re-issue by Lippert with all references to the original distributor, United Artists, removed. Even worse, it has been edited approx. 6 minutes and has splices 3 times during which bits of dialogue are missing. Having compared this to another print with the missing footage and correct titles on a 50-movie pack, I would advise staying away from the Roan edition until something better can be found."
2,"Powerful, but loud","This fan does move a lot of air, but it's quite loud even at its lowest setting. I could see it's use in a more industrial type setting, but as far as a household fan it's too loud for me. I'm looking for a different unit to replace this one."
1,Cool Breeze,"This Honeywell product is excellent. It works quietly and easily circulates air while providing the desired breeze.I believe the unit will outlive its generous warranty, and would not hesitate to purchase another one if and when it should wear out."
1,Amazon ships small fan and charges for the larger version,"Don't always believe what you see advertised on Amazon. Amazon shipped me the smaller version of the fan it advertised but still charged me the same higher price for the large fan it should have sent. I sent the small fan back to Amazon and ordered what I should have received from Kaz.com. The product is great, Amazon's service wasn't."
1,Loud as a Jet,"When this fan was marked down in price (way down), I thought I would be able to put up with a fan that was a little loud. Boy, was I wrong - this fan is so loud that I've never used it off the low setting. Even on low, I have to blast the TV to hear it over the fan. Yes, it's powerful and gives a good breeze - but if you have to be in the same room, I would plan on wearing ear plugs..."
2,Loud,"Thought I was getting a large and a small fan, since that is what was pictured. Only a large fan was sent. Fan was very, very loud, as other reviewers have said. I was hoping for the smaller fan, one of which I own, which was quiet."
3,Noisy!,"The fan works fine, it cools the room. It's just a bit noisy. Next time I'd spend the extra money to get one that quieter."
3,Not entirely as advertised but a good product,"As you can see, the description calls this an ""oscillating"" fan. However, the product manual is meant to be used with three different models of the same type of fan -- only the other two models oscillate. This model doesn't. On the other hand, the fan is really good for what it is. ""False advertising"" is too strong an indictment, but the advertising isn't quite all true, either."
3,"small , powerful and noisy",i paid $17.99 on Friday sale for this fan and got it because of low price . it has good design and is small and powerful . i use it in my kitchen as exhaust fan . please keep in mind that it is not silent at all and not worth more than $20 .
2,The Mango Lives on in the Form of A Creek,"This collection of short stories consist of a few intersting stories, however the majority of the stories were cluttered with over excessive drama, over worked imagery, aand repettion. A lot of her characters were reepresented in all of the stories, it was like yyou heard the voice of her characters in all her pieces. Not only were her characters over used but also her themes. A lot of her themes were focused on relationships between men and women and sex. Overall this book was a horrible extension of House On Mango Street."
1,"You Will Like This Book, I Didn't...","You will like this book...IF you watch Lifetime television.IF you consider yourself ""socially conscious"" and are interested in the ""chicana"" cause.IF you read books on ""the female experience""IF you have worn or do wear birkenstock sandals with socks.You will not like this book...IF you enjoy fine literature.IF you have read and enjoyed anything by Nabokov or Joyce.IF you have already suffered through House on Mango Street.IF you don't enjoy encountering paragraphs like the following...""Except it's not me who I want to kill. When the gravity of the planets is just right, it all tilts and upsets the visible balance. And that's when it wants to out from my eyes. That's when I get on the telephone, dangerous as a terrorist. There's nothing to do but let it come."" (Cisneros, Woman Hollering Creek p.83)I apologize if this offends any Cisneros fans, however, I must risk being impolite in order to save people the discomfort of reading this book."
5,You Go Girl!,"Great Book! Entertaining as well as informative. It made me want to explore the Hispanic culture, sing praises to the strength of women and find true love. This is a wonderful creation, but who would expect anything less from Cisneros."
4,4.5 Stars,"As usual, great, great work from Sandra Cisneros. She has such a unique voice and style and through her myriad narrators, this short story collection lays bare the realities of those who are oppressed and victimized. Many of the narrators are double minorities and the issues span from identity crises and gender bias, to patriarchal violence and class stratification. Cisneros has a way of using a conversational and seemingly simplistic (and often times childlike) voice to expose the very troubling and complex issues that occur to those who are caught between a rock and a hard place.Cisneros is among the very best in Chicana/o literature. She is brutally honest and not afraid to deal with the ugly side of stark reality. Often times funny, and always moving, this collection is highly recommended to all.Also recommended: The House On Mango Street"
5,A great collection of Satriani's softer ballads.,"This really is a beautiful album. It features all of Satch's softer songs up to the year 1993 and is great for any fan of excellent, well-written guitar music. It has a nice mix of electric and acoustic numbers. Included is one of his most famous and best songs ""Always With Me, Always With You"" which is a popular selection for many figure skaters to perform to. ""All Alone"" is another that is used in skating and is just as great. ""Cryin'"" is another very heartfelt number that is one of my favorites. ""Why?"" is slightly heavier, but just as nice as any of the others. I could go on, but I'll just say that this album is great and well worth the price. And it would be excellent to dance to, by the way."
4,Nice Compilation!,"The beautiful guitar is a compilation of 14 mellow, almost jazz like, tunes from 6 of Satriani's previous CD's that was released only in Germany. The disc demonstrates Satriani's mastery of his instrument. With the exception of ""I Believe"" the CD is entirely instrumental. If you believe that Satriani only plays heavy rock guitar, this CD will make you second guess that belief. A nice compilation for your collection but a little pricey."
3,Not the best introduction to Rigoletto,"Rigoletto is a wondeful opera that can be used as an introduction for beginners who want to explore the art of operas. Although I like the concept of Black Dog Opera Library that provides an attractive book and recording of a famous opera in a bargain price, I cannot recommend this book of Rigoletto. The major drawback lies in the recording that accompaies this book. I would say it is probably the most disappointing Rigoletto ever recorded by big names in the opera world."
5,A must-have resource!,"Not only is this book great to refer to when needed, it makes for an interesting leisurely read. The technique is well described and easy to do on your own. Includes an abundance of information for anyone who is interested in health and the influence of what affects the body and how. I find it easy to read and eye-opening."
1,There's much better available,"I was very disappointed in this book -- it's one of the few I've bought from Amazon based on reviews alone. Compared to herbal/nutrition books like The Green Pharmacy, Scientific Validation of Medicinal Herbs, and energy work/body work books like Touch for Health, I found this a mish-mash of information.I did not like the way in which the references (where there were any) to research were handled, the indexing is poor and information is hard to find, and the illustrations are extraordinarily ugly and amateurish.I'm very interested in muscle testing, so I'll look further."
5,"Inflamed ear, or ear infection?","As a holistic practitioner, The Ultimate Healing System is on my ""suggested reading"" list. I am all for having an informed client, and after they have read this book, THEY ARE INFORMED! The rice/wheat allergies regarding ear inflamations is notable. The author, in one instance suggests that allergies (the kind that do not show up on a prick test)are responsible for such things as ear inflamations. There are easy to follow muscle testing exercises that individuals can do to see if they have adverse reactions to such things as even the suppliments and vitamins they take.As a colon therapist, and advocate of good water,the chapter on Drinking Water, which was brief and to the point, could have contained more information.This is a great reference book to keep on hand at all times. But read it through FIRST!"
5,fantastic system & valuable info to guide one's health,"This book is filled with very valuable information on nutrition,healing, and self guidance to heal and keep healthy using kinesiology.It also explains various alternative holistic healing techniques."
4,Good quality but weird design,"I have removeable ball in this design and also the type with a push pin. The build quality of this shank and ball is good but it feels like this ball could bounce off the shank if a trailer isn't attached. Maybe I am just paranoid, I don't have a bad experience with it, it just feels too easy to come apart.Might be really good if you are switch hitch balls frequently."
5,Dark and deep,"I just finished reading THE GOLOVLOV FAMILY and am still reeling from it. That anyone could read this novel and not feel utterly gripped by it is beyond me. On the back cover the publishers felt the need to compare this masterpiece to Faulkner and Marquez, but I think Balzac is much closer in spirit: Balzac channeled through a Russian soul. The plotline involving Annika, though crushing, is embued with a haunting rapturousness. Such a shock to read a book as long neglected as this one (in the US, at least) and find a character so compellingly alive."
2,'FAR' from being 'new' and 'original',"after all the heart-tugging lyricsm from the O L D ep releases, not to mention FAR, and the awesome but short-lived N E O project... this???What a disappointment.Mediocrity and cheese at it's finest. I would like to believe Jonah is 'better than this'.If this is honesty, Jonah, I'd rather you fake it."
1,battery charger,"The charger was received with the large transformer flopping around in the case of the charger, i contacted the manufacturer of the charger and they said i would have to pay $25 shipping on it, and they would repair the charger???? I think their quality control needs to be improved and i don't feel i should pay $25 shipping to have a new charger repaired."
3,Good book,I enjoyed this book more then my 6 year old boy. He was not as entertained as I but allowed me to share with him just the same:)
3,Sentimental verses very inferior to the Pooh books,"I spent my childhood and adolescence in sight of Ashdown Forest, England, where the Pooh books are set. I still retain a deep affection for them. But Milne's verse is something else and would long-ago have been forgotten but for the stories with which it is associated. Nobody who has seen the parody:Hush, Hush. Nobody cares. Christopher Robin has fallen down stairs.will ever again be able to read Milne's sentimental whimsies with a straight face. The book is only worth three stars for the beautiful illustrations by E H Shepard"
1,Tremendously dissatisfied!,"What a horrible experience with this seller. The book arrived twenty-four days after it was ordered, wrapped in a manilla envelope with no padding/protection, and damaged. I alerted the seller of my displeasure and was informed I would receive a refund. To date, it has been sixteen days and no refund has been received. My recommendation: Buy the book - it's well worth it - from another seller!"
5,Now We Are Six,I ordered NOW WE ARE SIX for my great-nephews sixth birthday. I also gave it to my now 43-year-old daughter for her sixth birthday.A.A Milne's Pooh books are precious; every child should be exposed to them.
5,Now We are Six by A.A. Milne,"A book of poems and selections based on characters and events in ""Winnie-The-Pooh by the same author. I like to give it to my young friends on their 6th birthday. A good book to be read to the child; a book to appreciate more as the child can read it for him or herself."
4,one of Biggers' best,"An enjoyable detection romp from the author of the Charlie Chan stories. Biggers, a real turn-of-the-previous-century romantic, creates stories filled with fun and optimism. Great reading for tweens who like the classics."
4,Your Cup of Tea,"If you enjoy 1920s Saturday Evening Post mystery stories, 50 CANDLES is your cup of tea. Charlie Chan is conspicuous by his absence. It is difficult to defend one's quirks, literary or otherwise, and I won't do so now--except to note that perhaps the season contributes to one's a sense of nostalgia."
4,"A good Biblical Fiction story, with some surprising twists",This is a good book. I am doing this book in school right now and will be done with it today. Bob Jones delivers a striking story of a young man named Joel. And there are some surprising things you will learn from this story-- if you know the story of how Jesus was crucified. I would say that anyone who enjoyed Ben-Hur(which I did) shoudl get this book and read it. It may prove to be an acceptably joyable read.
5,Truly a Gift!,"This book is a gift I gave to myself. After reading Part One, I bought several more copies for my friends and family. The book is not just for yogis. It is for anyone on the path to wellness and spiritual discovery. I have learned so much about myself from reading the daily essays and applying them to my own life. As Gates says so eloquently, ""the obstacles on the path ARE the path."" Think about that for a moment and quite possibly you will begin to see that what happens in life happens for a reason and the first thing you have to do is simply ""Show Up."""
4,nice,nice for early mornings and a quick stretch or workout.good instructions and the visuals are pleasant. I like it.
5,This book is phenomenal!,"I have just recently gotten into yoga and I can't believe what a godsend this book is! I feel like I have a teacher and an incredible coach right at my fingertips whenever I need it. I have given this book to some of my dearest friends and we actually call each other to read excerpts every time they seem to ""speak directly to our lives""--which feels like all the time. I am getting incredible guidance from this. Really, this book is a gem. (This is the first time I have actually felt moved to write one of these reviews--that has to say something.)"
5,Yoga Bible,"I borrowed this book, and then had to buy it for myself so I'd have one I could mark it up. It's a great devotional, keeping your mind focused on the larger picture. Rolf Gates has developed such a depth to his walk and his practice. It is so worth plumbing his mind in this book."
1,do not buy this badly printed copy,"I know nothing of the book because I could not get that far. My copy was clearly a photocopied hunk of junk in a badly bound hard binding. There were multiple photocopy stray marks throughout the book (random blobs like you get with a photocopier). There was at least one page where the type was wavy like what happens when you photocopy something that is not totally flat. The margins were too big so it looks more like a photocopy of the actual book. The binding itself was actually uneven. The page that tells you who published it and when said 1944, and did not mention a more recent printing which indicates to me that it is possibly a pirate even. It is total crap. I had to send mine back."
2,Poor acting Western!!!,This film has a good idea for an action filled western--but where is it? The actors in this are just average at best and the action scenes are poorly made. The lack of any great actors is evident and the battle shoot out parts appear real fake. I have seen a lot of westerns filmed during the 1950s to 1960s that are much better than this one. The black and white background is great-the only thing going for this one.
4,"Great Story, but watch the language","Got this book because it was on the Sunshine State Readers list for 3-5 grade. Problem: author uses language that is inappropriate for this age group. Several uses of the word ""bu**"" another ""fa**"" and several ""b**b"", which I find inappropriate for 8 -10 year old kids. My local public elementary school won't even stock the book. Why would Mr. Fogelin do this to an otherwise great kids book?"
3,"Tachometer Works But It Comes With a Hard Case, Not the Soft Bag Shown in Picture","The tachometer works as expected. I used it to confirm that the RPM of my snow thrower engine is running within in the ball park range. This is good.But it comes with a hard case, not the soft bag shown in the picture. I actually paid extra from this vendor to get the soft bag because I don't have a good impression of hard case. But I end up getting a hard case. I could have ordered it from a different vendor and save some money. They should change the picture or lower the price."
2,A waste of my time.,"This is a cobbled-together story made up of various accounts of events by the participants, with little to recommend it, IMHO."
3,Viet Nam reading with lots of combat,Story runs kind of slow and makes it difficult for you to stay involved in the plot. It is particularly slow while discussing the earlydays of training. Once you get out of training and get to Viet Nam the story gets much more involved and you stay involved.
4,Green ghosts,"A truly remarkable story about truly remarkable men. Who among us would have the courage to volunteer for such duty? Only those who did know the answer to that question. These are the types of stories that need to be told so that Vietnam Vets are not pigeon holed into the stereotypical drugged out lunatics as is commonly portrayed. There may be some like that. But we need to know more about those like the Recon vets to highlight that, by and large, our military is filled with those who serve with pride and professionalism."
3,OK read-some concerns,"I read the Mandie books when I was a little girl and am now reading through the series again as an adult. This book's mystery was intriguing, BUT I have some concerns that perplexed me about my childhood favorite. The biggest concern is the theology and how it seems to be teaching kids work-based salvation. Tsani is often reffered to as ""a bad cherokee"" and therefore hopeless. Jesus is never mentioned-only believing in God. The characters are legalistic and judgmental and Mandie is portrayed as the good, sweet girl because she wants to help her cherokee people when in reality she is selfish and judgmental (but noone ever calls her ""a bad half white girl."" It's sad when Christian literature is more concerned about teaching children to ""be good"" than to have compassion, as Jesus taught."
5,Great book!,In this book Mandie visits her Cherokee kin people. Her cousin takes her and her 2 friends into a cave and leaves them. When trying to escape they find a pile of gold. To find out more read this book!
4,What you should know about the nearest star,"This is a very nice book that will be of interest both to amateur astronomers and people with good physics background. The author separated descriptive text from text with mathematical content and as a result one can choose to read in a depth appropriate to their background. The book is also very well illustrated with informative captions below each picture. It is clear that the author is enthusiastic about the subject. However, what I did not like was that almost 100 from the 250 pages are devoted to general astronomical concepts and a glossary. This material is good but I would prefer to read more details about the sun. If the introduction explained solar physics (such as magnetism, spectra) in much more detail then subsequent chapters would be understood even better. I recommend the book to all people with a serious interest in the physics of our star."
4,Play tent is fun for kids but not very durable,I purchased this pacific play tente hide me tent & Tunnel combo for my son for a christmas present i was very pleased at the price ant the rapid free shipping(thank you amazon this is why your one of my first choices fo orders online) the first time we set up the tent was on christmas day for my 2 year old son and 6 yeay old daughter within an hour of play the stiching on the tunnel that holds the spring to the tunnel fabric came loose and exposed the metal spring resulting in my wife having to get out the sewing kit and repair it other than that problem it has been a wonderfull toy for our kids they really enjoy playing in it and after all thats what its all about when buying a toy.........
3,Expensive for what it is,It is supposed to have padding for knees and hands. I don't see that. I think it is a bit flimsy and certainly not worth the asking price.
4,good for all ages,Both my 1 and 6 year old enjoy this toy very much!! Very glad that I purchased it!
3,Easy to Read But too many Errors,"This book is very practical. It is easy to get along as all the formulas are summarized in a nice way.However, I am very disappointed because I found a lot of errors in the book. I can't believe I am reading a third edition book with such many errors. Most of the errors are typos. But some of the errors are even in the formulas. That means if you follow these wrong formulas, you get wrong answer!I will report the major errors I found here:(1)P147 The first two equations are for ""Total"" (Not ""Mean""), the second two equations are for ""Mean"" (Not ""Total"").(2)P149 The first equation, on the left handside, it should be ""SE_hat(X_str')"" not (SE_hat(X_str_bar)).(3)P149 The third equations, under square root, there should be a summation from h=1 to L.(4)P170 equation 6.20. The right most term should be ""((N-N_h)/N)"", not ((N-n_h)/N).I havent finished the book yet. I will keep posting the errors as I read along."
5,"A review, solely about the text.","I am a Ph.D. student in public health (epidemiology), and I already have a Ph.D. in the behavioral sciences. I will sign my name, unlike the other writer. Rather than solely talk about the issues of the text, the student complains about the administration of the course in question.I found the text to be readable and useful. My findings concur with the practitioner and other reviewers in Columbus, OH. I found the use of the solutions manual to be helpful in my understanding of the material.The complaints voiced by the ""stats student"" are best ignored. I was in that course section, and those comments are not relevant to the worth of the text."
4,Great replacement cap,This a great replacement cap for a classic vehicle. It is all metal with a nice chrome cover. My only complaint is the metal sticker on the front of the cap that tells you to open slowly. It really looked tacky on my 1954 dodge pickup. I was able to remove it with some difficulty as I did not want to damage the chrome with a razor blade.
3,the prettiest but the lamest force fx,"This saber is an anomaly in the Force FX lineup. For some unknown reason, it's a total battery pig, requiring 6 AA's when most of the others only take 3. And then, it's got the worst sound and the dimmest blade! Lowest volume, least clarity - like a cheap speaker set. In contrast, the green Luke and the green Yoda will make you jump back the first time you fire them up - super bright and very loud and crisp.I own 6 sabers including the Darth Maul double blader and the Mace Windu has been the only one to have technical problems. My first one was warrantied when the power pack melted itself and my current one just had a 50% LED failure. This is a beautiful hilt with the slickest power switch, but as a toy, it's a bit of a lemon.Given a choice, go with Anakin blue, Luke green or Darth Maul. Yoda is pretty great too."
2,Great Collector Piece,"My children (8 & 10) LOVE this lightsabre, but they are meant to be displayed. Our is on display after other kids in the neighborhood played with theirs too roughly and broke them. This is TOOOO expensive to be a toy, display it instead!"
2,Good Intro to Chinese Medicine,"I initially purchased this book because I was looking for a kind of guide to using Chinese Exercise Balls 101. Aside from the occasional typo found in the book Ab Williams writes a rather amateurish introduction to Chinese medicine beginning with Taoism, Yin & Yang, the various meridians found along the physiological plain and concludes with a short blurb about use of and benefits of the exercise balls. The last third of the book is devoted to pushing various authors titles in all things eastern medicine oriented. You could probably find a more detailed book for less money at a used book shop but for my purposes I gave this particular title two stars."
5,A homecoming of sorts.,"In Sharpe's Regiment, Richard Sharpe takes a time out from the horrors of the Peninsular Campaign and finds an even more appalling situation back home in England. If reading the series in order, this book will provide you with a different look at Sharpe and serve as the turning point in both his military and personal lives. As always Cornwell's attention to historical detail shines through, showing the reader what was going on back in England while Wellington's forces persued Napolean across Europe."
3,"Sharpe at his best, Kindle at his worst",A great Sharpe story. But the Kindle version on my app has ugly fat margins - which can't be changed in the app - and has aboundant typos with missing or unwanted whitespaces.
4,Sharpe returns home to fight a different kind of battle.,"Major Sharpe finds himself in Spain in June 1913 without promised reinforcements, which have mysteriously disappeared. He journeys to England, Sergeant Harper by his side, to find out what became of them. Along the way, he uncovers an old enemy, the cowardly Sir Henry Simmerson, and a new one, the duplicitous Lord Fenner, who have connived to deceive everyone from Wellington to the Prince of Wales. Naturally, even though besotted by love for Sir Henry's niece, Jane Gibbons, Sharpe perseveres to uncover the treachery."
3,Peculation and crimping described,"As historical fiction this would rate a four of five just for describing peculation and crimping, practices of self-enrichment at the expense of the Empire done by English officers at the time of the novel. Where else can you find a lively and interesting description of this kind of thing? Only Cornwell brings it to life for such a large audience and that's a real service.But contrasted to his many other works, the novel lacks something. I am not sure what if not pacing, the ability to maintain and build the dramatic tension. I found this book far easier to lay down and forget than many other works by Cornwell.That doesn't mean it isn't a worthwhile and enjoyable installment in the series. It is and I'm thankful for it. But don't start a cherry on this one, there's a lot better first tastes to be had."
1,"Book for brain disabled but with healthy, national heart!","God save the Queen and Sharpe, the English Rambo"
2,No Rubber Seal,I figured that a gas cap like this would ship with a rubber seal on the inside. It does not. Had to makeshift a rubber seal. Really a big bummer.
5,Not just for traveling!,"I originally got this as a travel dish but I've found it the most useful at home. My little dogs outside water bowl seemed to attract other animals and our neighbors pets onto my porch to drink out of their bowl. I didn't like the idea of strange animals leaving their germs behind in my dogs water dish, but I also didn't want to leave them out with no water so I've been having to dump the water daily and refill it each morning. When this dish arrived, I had a brain storm to fill it with water and when we go in for the night, I stand it on end and wedge it between our patio table legs. Works like a charm!! No more strays on my porch now that they know they can't get water from it! Thank you! I love this water dish!!!!"
5,dry floors,"We love the Water Boy water dish.No longer constantly mopping up after our dog drinks. We have given one to our daughter for her dog and she loves it.We are buying more for other family dogs and want a spare for us when the summer comes,heard you can fill half way and freeze so it's ready for a hot day or just a hike through the park."
2,Travel water bowl best suited to smaller breeds,"I gave this a two star rating based on the fact that mine was to be used for a larger dog. This product would be adequate for a small dog. But the opening for a dog with a larger muzzle is not large enough. The claims for not spilling water seem to be true. However, since only about an inch of water is in the bottom of the opening at any time, it's more difficult for a larger dog to get his nose in and get a good drink. I guess if the dog were extremely thirsty and had no other water supply, this could do in a pinch."
2,"Doesn't normally spill, but also doesn't dispense enough water","I purchased this water bowl for use at the dog park. It seems fairly sturdy and has a nice squat shape that would be hard for a dog to accidentally knock over. It also holds a pretty good amount of water.I wish the blue cap were easier to screw on. It usually takes me several tries because it seems to want to cross thread.The main issue I have, though, is that the blue cap fills with less than an inch of water under normal operation. The water level rises significantly when I apply pressure to the other end of the container using my foot. Once I release the pressure, the water level falls back down.This is a problem at the dog park for two reasons:1. I have to remain standing nearby the Water Boy in order to dispense water (with foot pressure) for the thirsty dogs.2. Quite a few dogs are too nervous to drink water while I've put my foot down right next to their noses."
1,"Waste of money, unless you like wet carpeting in your car","I needed a spill-proof bowl for a road trip, and I had seen one in a pet store before with a lip on the edge, that prevented sloshing water from spilling over the edge. They had none left, in stock, so I got this one instead. BAD DECISION. Any time you start up or stop, water sloshes over the edge. My carpeting has never been so wet. AND, it leaks around the cap also. If you screw it down a little to tight, it leaks around the O-ring. If a little to loose, it also leaks around the O-ring. I ordered a Buddy Bowl to replace this, and it's perfect. Not only does it have a lot more water in the bottom of the bowl so the dog doesn't have to wait after every lap for the bowl to fill up, you can be a speed racer and the water won't slosh out because of the rim."
1,Bad material causing water to rot! Very bad!!,If I could give this a 10 below zero I certainly would!! I never do reviews but in this situation I felt it imperative! I purchased 2 of these and I am so sorry that I ever put it down for my little puppies to drink out of. The problem is that in only one day the water goes sour and smells like a sewer! !! BOTH OF THEM!! That smell can be smelled without putting it near your nose! Not at all good for ANY animal including humans to drink from! I used both distilled water and bottled water to see if it made a difference. It did not! I feel that the material it is made of causes this smell! Do not buy this product OR even take it for free!The seller is good and sent this out very quickly. Not their fault I'm sure! Please take this off the market to protect the pets!
4,Leaker,"Works good, but can't stand it up because gasket doesn't seem to work against leakage, from the beginning. However, my dog uses it just about every time we go somewhere, so it's always laying down and in use."
3,it's okay,"I like to carry water to the dog park to save a trip to the water fountain for my two dogs. Before you know it, I've got a pack of dogs surrounding me waiting for a drink. The Lixit holds enough water for a few dogs to quench their thirsts. One downside of the Lixit is the size of the bowl. It's just big enough for a snout to get in there, and the water level is very low so the snout has to really go in deep. I have to tilt it so there's enough water to lap. It serves its purpose, but it would be really great if they'd change the design somehow so that the water level is higher. I wouldn't recommend it for a very long walk since it only has a handle for carrying, not a strap of any kind. Otherwise, a good product for having some water on hand for my thirsty guys and few of their friends."
2,Frustrating for big tongues!!,"I thought I was going to love this product, that it was a great idea...but my small german shepherd pawed and pawed at this. The small amount of water it provided only seemed to frustrate her. The pawing lead to the blue plastic cracking and breaking. Also, when she pawed it over, it did spill (she got the water then!) Not recommended for big smart dogs!"
5,Water Boy Portable Water Bowl,"Water Boy 3 Quart Portable Water BowlThis water bowl is perfect to take in the car, to trials and dog shows or to class. It is very difficult to spill and even then it is only a small amount instead of the entire bowl. We have found it to be the best way to carry water with us for our dog."
5,Lixit Waterboy,LOVE IT! No other way to describe that. Made of plastic and after the initial day of showing my dogs how to use this they have it down! Easy clean up and pretty durable so far. I have one outside and one inside and it does help control the mess from them drinking water.
5,Best bowl,"We bought one of these for travel and when the vacation was over we had placed it in the kitchen to keep pets from slopping water all over. All the pets love it and fight over it and when we refill it is the bowl they wait to drink out of. Looking to purchase more for this reason. They are a little bit of a pain to clean out, but I use warm water and dental tablets and then rinse well."
1,Doesn't work,I filled the water to the fill line and it leaks. BTW the seal was fine. When I put it down and the water went into the bowl it did come out. When I picked it up to move it to the back of the car the water didn't go back into the bottle but spilled out of the bowl. I tried filling it below the water line and the same thing happened. What a waste of money.
1,SOMETHING ELSE TO RECYCLE,"I bought this with high hopes and quickly realized why it was at Marshalls. The cap/bowl WILL NOT, NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO, screw down tightly. All of these leak and are a HORRIBLE design. To think these retards patented this makes me laugh. There are not enough screw threads in the plastic, on either piece, to give holding power to the cap...it just pops right off. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY...YOU WILL, I ASSURE YOU, BE QUITE SORRY YOU DID."
4,Great travel water bowl,"I am happy with this product and they are spill proof as stated. I would love to see a cover to make this product leak proof too! If you lay the travel water bowl flat they do not spill, however they do spill if you place them in an upright position. I place these in the freezer and then take these to the fields to water the dogs while we are planting.My chocolate lab has no problem drinking from this product."
2,not so great,"My cat can still splash water out of it after the cont. is filled. However, when water level goes down some there is then only about 1/4 inch of water in the bottom of the bowl for cat to drink. Not so great."
2,Not for stationary use. Needs work,"The good: Great capacity. The bad: Since the bowl creates a sealed environment, dogs promptly lick it down to nothing. (it is hard to explain). Trouble is, even with the reservoir filled to capacity, when the dogs drink they just empty the cup where the water is. You then have to tilt/shake the whole thing for more water to come into the cup. This probably works great if it is sitting on a moving vehicle, but at home, the dogs are just licking and licking the few drops that are on the bottom of the drinking cup. The manufacturer needs to re-engineer this thing so that it keeps a higher water level in the bowl."
2,Whose Planet Is This For?,"A friend gave me a copy of this book--and at first I was delighted. However, it made me more and more uneasy. What difference does it make if we pronounce things differently--even incorrectly--if the people around us understand us? So we don't appear stupid? So we can appear to be elite? Where I live, I often have to listen closely and patiently to understand immigrants' English. It seems silly to worry about trivial differences under these circumstances.Walking through downtown Pasadena today, I heard two girls talking: I'm so excited about esta noche, one said to the other. What fun to bounce between two languages like that! With this kind of vitality, who needs a dried-up old guide to speaking ever so precisely?"
3,NewfoundLAND-Understand,"Ha! I was coming here to praise this book with the exception of the pronunciation given for ""Newfoundland""; it appears that others have commented on this topic ... consider the sentiment seconded. Disagreements here and there are going to arise, but disregarding the way in which the inhabitants of a place pronounce its name makes me call into question Elster's other research and entries."
3,"Made in China, labels hardly removable","The cue itself is good quality (for 45 $) and nice to play (good cue for beginners), but the labels which were on the cue were so hard to remove (took about 10 minutes to remove and clean it). Not well thought out.I thought the cue to be made in the US - it ist NOT. There's a label on it: Made in China. I don't think that this fact was mentioned in the description.(I bought the Minnesota Fats Hustler High Tech Grip Graphite Cue in orange)"
4,Nice stick,Bought for my wife and she really likes it. Packaged well and looks as described. Quality seems pretty good too. We'll see how well it does with some use.
3,It's a good beginner cue,"Contrary to the product description, the one I've received is 19 oz, and there isn't any easy way to replace the weight bolt. It seems that all MFH2X60 series come in two flavors - 19 or 20 oz. If you really need to specify the weight, you'd better look elsewhere. On the other hand, this is a pretty good beginner cue stick. When the two pieces are put together, the center of mass is about 4.5'' from the top edge of the grip. I'd have given it 4 stars if those ""Made in China"" labels weren't so hard to remove (in fact, I had to use isopropanol to clean off the adhesive residue along the shaft)."
5,Perfect replacement;),"These earrings are gorgeous! The shipping was fast and I am very pleased. A great replacement for my precious moldavite earrings I had lost the week before, but now I am not as sad because these are prettier than the old ones;)This company is great and have had no problems with them. Plan to order more in the future!"
5,Gorgeous!,"Got these from my husband for Christmas and they are gorgeous! Light weight and pretty. Would highly recommend these earrings to anyone who loves silver, the color green and stars or the combination of all three together. Great for the holidays!"
5,"Relaxing, refreshing and rejuvenating","I love this CD! I purchased it on a whim, I was looking for something to help me sleep. It does help with sleep and so much more. It also works great for relaxing and meditating. The music is soothing and unobstrusive. You will find yourself able to fall asleep quicker and have a deeper more regenerative sleep. This is exactly what I needed.I highly recommend it for anyone needing help falling asleep and staying asleep. If I wake up during the night, I just turn this CD on and within a few minutes I am back to sleep.Check out the other CD's in his collection, they are all wonderful!"
2,Retraction! Company fixed CD Works Great now!,The company fixed the CD and sounds great now! Great company to work with. Very responsive. Would definitely buy from them again!Would definitely give them 5 stars but Amazons review editing system won't let me change my rating!
5,Very Quick,"This icemaker churns out a full bucket of ice in less than 24 hours. Very easy to install, my only comment is that it doesn't mention anything about the copper pipe in the initial required materials and isn't mentioned until the appendix."
1,GE=No Good,GE neglects to inform you that you need a special 1/4 inch saddle valve! It cost me 150.00 for a diagnosis with out putting it on. If your cubes are hollow or slushie this is the problem. I contacted GE with 502-452-4205 they dismiss the problem and cost. I will never buy GE again!
2,Ice maker,"The ice maker works OK, but the plastic on/off control tends to turn itself off as the ice cascades from the maker into the tray. We have to constantly monitor the control manually in order to make sure it remains on."
4,No problems,"The Ice maker works great. In fact, it almost makes too much ice. The ice falling into the bin is a little noisy, but otherwise I have no complaints. It was easy to install."
1,terrible GE service,"Bought the icemaker and installed it ourselves.It worked very well for a few months and then thearm that detects whether the ice bucket is full or notdidn't go back into place. The whole thing stoppedworking, probably the motor burned out, according tothe GE technician we talked to on the phone. However, GEsays the warranty is invalid because we installed itourselves. They weren't saying we installed it improperlyjust that they weren't responsible for replacing the faulty part.Will never buy anythiung made by GE."
1,Not sure --,"This was the name of the same replacement unit we had for our refrigerator. However, we have not gotten the icemaker to work yet. We're not sure what the problem is. Most items we have gotten through Amazon have been great."
1,"These ""Boys"" still have a lot of growing to do","If someone had told me 10 years ago that Girls Against Boys would still be playing today such minor-league Manhattan clubs as the Mercury Lounge and Brownies, I would have called them crazy. I was sure these guys were going to make it big. But I've grown up, and most things around me have changed. Except, apparently, GVSB. Now when I listen to some of my old GVSB recordings, my adolescent bad taste embarrasses me. Yet here we have another GSVB CD, one that sounds exactly like the stuff they put out way back when, just as monotonous and just as adolescent. Maybe the fact that their music hasn't evolved has a lot to do with the fact they went nowhere and that their one mainstream recording a few years ago flopped so badly. Only singer Scott McCloud sounds like he has any energy left. The rest of the group just seems to be going though the motions. This CD is a complete fiasco. Sadly, it seems, these ""Boys"" are never going to be Men."
4,Back to basics,"First off, let it be said that I loved Freakonica. It seems that people came down on that album b/c of it's techno tendencies. Man, that album rocked and was one of the more refreshing pieces of alternative to hit the shelves in a long time. Now, back to You Can't Fight What You Can't See. Forget Freakonica. This album is bass, guitar and hard pounding drums. They rip through all eleven tracks with a ferocity not seen since before House of GVSB. Vocals and lyrical styles are the same as always. You don't know what the songs are about you just know they sound cool. And coolness is what GVSB has always been about. But it."
3,Semi-comeback,"House of GVSB and Venus Luxure are my favorite GVSB albums. This comes closer to them than Freakonica did, but still falls short. While Freak seemed to showcase some failed experiments, at least they were experimenting. This is an album of GVSB playing it safe, taking no chances. It's a bit bland at times. I think I now officially prefer New Wet Kojak to GVSB."
2,Don't like this one? You're listening to the wrong band!,"The best way I can describe this album is that it gives me the same feeling I get when I'm looking through the used CD bin at the local shop, and I discover an old gem of a CD that I bought way back when that I either lost or used to own on cassette and never upgraded. In most cases, after three listens I pop it into the ol' CD rack and forget about it--just like I forgot about it until I saw it in the used CD bin!If you feel like this album is a step in the wrong direction for GVSB (and correct me if I'm wrong but few bands if any have ever made a successful regression to their original formula) then you should check out the amazing stuff that Scott Temple and John McCloud are doing in New Wet Kojak. To me, their sound in that project, although a bit less rock-oriented, would have been a nice succession to Freak on Ica."
3,"Buy for looks, not for content.","The Book of Goddesses highlights 25 goddesses from different pantheons and offers spells/rituals for them. This would make a fine book to give as a gift for someone very mildly interested in goddess-lore. I would not recommend it to pagan practitioners or anyone seriously interested in goddess myths. The research is very questionable and I am not frankly sure where the author came up with some of her summaries. There is no bibliography listed and some of what she says just does not make sense - Diana is not the 'guardian of virginity;' she is a 'virgin goddess.' There is a difference.The art is ok and the rituals/spells are ok. Buy for looks, not for content."
2,Like reading a boring textbook,"This book was so boring! It was all he said they said. Come on the guy's dead we don't have to keep hidden information about his warcrimes anymore, he's never going to be in a courtroom. I wanted to read about the stuff that pops into your head when you say the name MENGELE! show people that there really are monsters in the world."
4,Satan Revisited,"The one chapter about all the horror in Auschwitz is enough to show that Mengele was not a member of the human species and no human attributes should ever be applied to ""him"" in the past, present, and future. He thought the Jews and other victims were sub-human. Why doesn't this apply to him exponentially? It is absolutely devastating that someone like Mengele, who deserved the absolute worst evaded capture for decades as this book clearly shows. He will now have a much harder time evading capture from God. This book needs to be read by more people in the world so hopefully something more positive in society could come about from these horrors."
3,"Mengele, the unbalanced story","The book describes the early life of Mengele in Germany and the late life as a fugitive in South America. The part about young Mengele and later sick SS doctor is quite small and this is a serious flaw. The subject of the book should have required a deeper analysis of the early life of Mengele, instead the author spends the main part of the book in describing the hunt for this man and the role of the various secret agencies and hunters.I think the goal of this book should have been to understand why Mengele did what he did ( possibly with comparison with other evil creatures from Hitler gang or other figures ) and not to explain the details of his uninteresting exile."
4,Not the complete story,"Although the author put a great deal of effort into researching the life and history of Joseph Mengele, the author appears to have omitted pertinent details about reports - from numerous victims - of human experiments that Mengele perpetrated against children and others in Canada and the U.S. after WWII. Mengele was brilliant, and I believe this is one reason why he was never prosecuted, and why his death was repeatedly faked...including in 1979. (Google ""Mengele twin"" survivor Eva Kor's conversation with former SS Dr. Munch to learn more.) Because Mengele was sadistic, brutal, conscienceless, and dangerously grandiose and narcissistic, our government made a serious error in moral judgement by encouraging him to continue assaulting and torturing innocent human ""guinea pigs""...supposedly in the name of science and U.S. national security. To learn more about Mengele's post-war criminal activities in the U.S. and Canada, read ""A Nation Betrayed"" by Carol Rutz."
2,Mengele: The Complete Story,Was hard to stay interested in this book. I found it very boring to read.
4,Tapicer√≠a de autor customizados,"I think we need to have a seccti√≥n, in the book, about the different materials used in car upholstery and the treatment (not the same management that management leather fabric or synthetic leather). But what is outlined in the book is very useful and I feel satisfied. Anyway, ""practice makes perfect"" and this is a guidebook. Thanks for selling books in Spanish.Me parece que hace falta tener un apartado, en el libro, sobre los diferentes materiales a usar en tapicer√≠a de autos y su tratamiento (no es lo mismo el manejo de cuero natural que manejo de la tela o el cuero sintetico). Pero lo que se apunta en el libro es de gran utilidad y me siento satisfecho. De todas formas, ""la pr√°ctica hace al maestro"" y este es un libro gu√≠a. Gracias por vender libros en espa√±ol."
3,Don't judge a book by its cover.,"This is a nice little book, however, the cover is misleading. My daughter's favorite penguins are Emperor penguins, as shown on the cover, which is why I bought this book. Unfortunately the penguins we watch grow on the inside of the book are King penguins, which aren't nearly as cute as babies as Emperors are."
2,"""Penguin ( See how they grow)","This experience was disappointing The book is ""OK..."" but not much more than a comic book, some photos were 'vague' and it cost, $3.95. This in itself I could accept, but shipping was another $7.95 !I AM new to Amazon... maybe I did something wrong?"
1,False information on hatching,"I was at first glance very impressed and about to order this book due to the photos. However, the ""inside pages"" tells something to the effect of ""my mommy just laid me and will take care of me until I hatch."" This is incorrect information, especially in relation to Emperor Penguins. The daddy is who ""as soon as the egg is laid the scoops it up from the female. He places it on top of his feet and covers it with a thick warm fold of belly skin, which is rich is richly endowed with blood vessels.""My kindergarten students love to learn about penguins and normally I really like the DK books for their realism. However this is one book I won't purchase now due to false information."
4,American fun kids,"Los Mocosos (literally the fun kids) are keeping up with their efforts to mainstream their music. Although the band and their work is relatively unknown, their music continues to improve. This is their third release and is a pleasant collection of well arranged, well produced originals and standards. Their Latino style of music is fresh, orginal and uplifting."
3,Not really for outdoor use unless you're willing to re-setup...,"I purchased the tent and tunnel for my kids. I sat it up outdoors and then quickly discovered that it has no rain flap and the entire top is open. I am either going to have to find a way to attach some sort of tarp to it or painfully take it down each night in order for it not to be soaked inside with water. I also think that it should be recommended for kids 3 - 7 yrs.... kids any older get hung up to easily.They are however, bright, pleasing, colors to look at."
3,Could you feel more awkward?,"I enjoy watching Mel Gibson, even enough to watch this movie. I can appreciate how far he has come in his career. I just felt a little weird watching him as a ""slow"" boy working for, and eventually getting ""involved"" with an older woman. But, what can you say... it's Mel Gibson and hey, all actors started somewhere! : )"
2,High School Drama (sigh),"The main character (Lowdnes) can be praised for her efforts in this movie. Not only is she the only person in this movie who makes sense, but she is also the only one who isn't a whiny high schooler.I'm sure the other actors are just playing the script, but they were so annoying that I had to resist the urge to throttle the tv, and slap some sense into their heads.I only paid $2.00 for this movie. I only paid that because of the monster I saw in the previews. I really need to stop watching any movies that begins with the sypnosis of: ""A group of college kids"", or ""Friends celebrating spring break"", etc. Any horror movie that begins with something similar to that always seems to portray several characters you don't care about being killed, and leaves you scratching your head in frusteration as the characters make one stupid move after another.I give it 2 stars for the monster, and Lowdnes, but I honestly can't recommend this movie to anyone."
2,"RENT THIS, DON'T BUY.","The cover deceives you into thinking the movie is more than it actually is. Not scary. I want to be scared out of my wits when I watch a so called scary movie. Young people go up in a small plane with their friend who just got her pilots license who is totally useless when things start to go wrong. The friends are stupid for going on this little trip. No one put a gun to their heads. And the ending didn't make much sense (to me anyway). I wish I would have rented it, I would not have bought it."
2,The main plot was the worst part,"I loved the whole plot of a malfunction causes a pain to increase in height with the passengers loosing their minds, but the whole supernatural aspect was what ruined the movie.The acting wasnt that all bad but the plot really got bizare...in a bad way with the last 30 minutes left. The ending was predictable. I was thinking that was the case 20 minutes into the movie...at the latest.They should have removed the crappy supernatural aspect and kept the plot simple and this movie would have been good.Skip this movie.Pros:- Plot first hour-Acting not that badCons:-Plot for the last half hour-The twist ending...was so predictable"
3,"The ""Monster"" is a little weak","Good story and a good cast make this film worth a look. The ""Monster"" is a little weak but the director keep's the action moving right along. I kept waiting to see the monster and once I saw it I was disappointed, but the beast was not on screen much so I did not suffer long. Give this movie a look if you are a fan of the Twilight Zone or Outer Limits."
3,This is a teen movie!,Just finished watching this exciting film! I must say that it was pretty bad.The main character Sarah Jessica Lowndes is the only reason i watched it. The plot they go in the air a monster comes to life brought on by the guy Sarah knows. I would say watch something else unless you like teen no plot movies!
2,"While Watching A Disaster Film, A Monster Floated By...","I guess I would have enjoyed ALTITUDE a lot more if: A) It wasn't sold as a monster movie. B) The actual creature had been in it for longer than 20 seconds. C) The whole film had been about 30 minutes in length. As an ""airplane-in-trouble"" movie, it could have been OK. That is, minus the flying octopus. As it is, I found myself waiting for something interesting to happen, only to have all hopes dashed. Please, if you are expecting a horror / monster movie, just forget it. Otherwise, you're in for a bout of air-sickness..."
2,I watched it so you don't have to,"The green screen 270-degree sheet that surrounds most of the plane gives us some good CGI of the storm outside. The filmmakers outsourced the CGI to China, but it's a shame they also didn't outsource the script, direction, and acting as well.The film's fails on most levels, but a production begins and ends with a strong script, and this film simply didn't have it. Characters have to be likeable in order for us to care about their fate, and these 5 are very often cartoonishly obnoxious. I didn't care that their lives were in danger. In fact, I couldn't wait for them to be killed off.There are some films that are so bad, they're good. This one isn't. It's so bad, it's bad. Even clocking in at 82 minutes before the long 8 minute closing credit sequence, it feels long and ponderous in most places.Not even worth a rental."
2,ALTITUDE JUST DOESN'T FLY,"An intriguing premise crash lands with a tremendous thud. Is ALTITUDE a horror movie? A disaster movie? A sci-fi/Fantasy? All of the above? Possibly, but it's too disjointed to succeed on any of these levels.It becomes tedious with annoying/unlikeable characters trapped in a plane. The CGI is subpar and leading actress Jessica Lowndes (90210) overdoes it pitifully. The cop out ending is the final bomb. A good idea gone awry."
1,I do not recommend it,"Is there really much to say about this movie, besides that it sucks major ###?I liked only 1 actor. Graphix were good from time to time. But what the hell with the guy who's fears turned into reality, huge monster floating in the air that look like octopus. I also wonder how no one freezed to death while constantly opening the door in the plane while flying? Only half of this movie literally was wasted on dialog of those friggin ###hole teens."
1,Not as described,What I recieved from Geroy's was 26 gauge and was labled as such. This was useless to me. There is a big differance betwee 26 gauge and 12 gauge thickness.
3,"A cute, feel-good romance","This was a cute take on a theme that's been told many times before - a woman engaged to Mr. Wrong gets stranded in a secluded cabin during a blizzard with commitment-phobe Mr. Right, and they each much reconcile the past before admitting that they belong together. A fun book to infuse Christmas spirit into the coldest December day!"
1,Waste of money and dangerous Steroids too,This stuff was a waste of money. It contains Androst chemicals which are steroids. There are safer products on the market too. I tried Instinto Sensual. It is safe and works great too.
4,This book taught me to sail,"Impressive breadth and sufficient depth to get you into the water. Particularly well-suited to the first-time, self-teaching small boat sailor. If you want to learn the basics from one book, this will do.Colorful glossy print on durable paper. Brimming with illustrations and photos."
4,A Handy Quick Reference Book,"Bond's Handbook of Sailing could be aptly titled ""The Encyclopedia of Sailing."" The book contains hundreds of entries covering just about any and every topic relating to sailing that you can think about. From knots to boat systems to weather to basic and advanced sailing techniques -- it's all here. You won't find in-depth information on any topic, but there's more than enough detail to make this an excellent overall reference. In addition, the book is superbly printed in full, bright colors on paper that staunch enough to survive life on-board any vessel"
5,hooks the brillant,this is a throuogh explanation on the state of the African American. it is a worthwhile book for anyone intersted in African Amrican people. it is a brillant book writtn by a brillant writer. it worth buying and reading it.
5,Another precious gem,"Required reading for anyone interested in the issue of self-esteem under oppressive cultures. Her observations are wise. Her grasp of history is absolute. Her ideas stimulate intelligent and loving thought, conversation, and action. Read this book."
4,Horton Foote is truely an amazing writer.,"I have not actually read this book, but I can offer you some input to it. My son was in one of the plays, ""Vernon Early"", in it's premier production. I can honestly say that Mr. Foote is an amazing writer. He has a real talent for capturing life with a true flavor. He has a way with the word, that will make you love, hate, pity, and sypathize with his characters. I know from our personal experience that it was a pleasure working with Mr. Foote and experiencing one of his plays from the inside."
3,"Great headphones, until they break","I bought these in December, 2006, and now in October 2008, they are good no more. Whenever I move the cord they crackle and one of the channels comes in and out, basically they are useless now. 22 months seems like a long time, but for most of that time period I wasn't really using them as I wasn't using my mp3 player, it wasn't until I got a Zune maybe 10 months ago that they started getting some use. In my opinion, you should be able to expect more than a year of moderate use (maybe 25 minutes a day) from $60 headphones!If you don't care about durability, they're great headphones. They do block most external noise, they have great quality, and they never slip out of your ears. The little slide on the cord helps prevent tangling when you put them in your pocket."
3,Works pretty well,Headphones work well to drown out other sounds but headphones can pick up the user's slightest movements. (Think of a stethoscope) No it will not pick up your heartbeat.
3,Buyer Beware,"I have had a great time with these for 7 months now, but about 2 months ago a problem started and I initially blamed it on my IPod...I was wrong.The sound shifts to the right side, sometimes bleeding some volume on the left with the main vocals to the right or sometimes there is no volume on the left side.Turn off the IPod and come back to it later and sometimes everything is good again, sometimes I have to wait longer. This problem happens for no apparent reason...I've been sitting in one place and suddenly the balance will shift, and I've been treating these headphones very well.If it wasn't for this problem I would recommend them to anyone, but now I am searching for something new. I love the sound of these and how it keeps out almost all necessary background noise."
4,Nice Buds,"These things are great. Once I put them in, the rest of the world goes silent. Great noise cancelling capabilities."
1,Poor Sound Quality for the price,"Compared to Shure's E2cs, the rival they're going for, it just doesn't match up. For almost the same price, they offer a higher noise isolation, i've compared them in outdoor environments."
3,Put them in your ears and noise comes out.,"A lot of people complain about the fit and about the bass. As far as things crammed in your ear, these feel about as good as I imagine they could. Sound wise, they are about on par w/ the factory iPod phones. Their big advantage is that when you get a good seal in your ear they really do cut out all the ambient noise. But hey, they are just a cheap pair of 'phones. Don't expect them to change your world."
1,Creative Zen Aurvana In-Ear Headphones the worst,"Not only was the bass nonexistent, buy the treble was tinny as well. Then they tell me it's a nonreturnable product so I'm stuck with it. Lesson learned. Bottom line - don't even think about buying these unless you're tone deaf."
2,Overpriced and uncomfortable,"These earbuds are more costly and less comfortable than the $50 S**y in-the-ear phones. And they don't sound any better. They do sound quite good, just no better."
1,"Sounds Great, but lasted only 2.5 months.","Great sounding earbuds, but after only 2.5 months became staticy and distorted. Thankfully, Amazon took them back. Great Company!"
3,Pretty decent for the price,Now that Creatives MP3 players have failed in the marketplace they have resigned themselves to producing iPod accessories. Of course this is actually made by Shure not Creative but its the same price as the E2C yet as slim as the E3C. Very nice headphones for the price. Shure has better warranty service if you need it though and you might if you travel alot.
2,Great quality...short life...didn't last long,"I commute by train to work each day and wanted these headphones to use every day to eliminate background noise on the train and as I walked in the city.These headphones worked great for that purpose. They were a little loud with the ""banging"" on your chest from the cords but overall I loved them.I am very disappointed in how long the product lasted. I consider myself an average user, not rough on stuff. The first pair of headphones broke after 3 months, developing a ""short"" in the wire that caused the headphones not to work. After a somewhat lengthy return process the second pair has died after 30 days. I am very upset.I went to radio shack and bought a pair of sony headphones for half the price. I have these expense ones, now broken again, collecting dust."
4,High Quality headphones,"The Aurvana Headphones are a great addition to my Zen Sleek mp3 player. The sound quality is far superior to that of other In-Ear headphones that I've tried, namely Sony and even worse, the new Bose In-Ear Headphones. My only complaint is that the volume is not as loud as the original headphones that come standard with the Zen Sleek but the Aurvana does an outstanding job of blocking out all background noises so you only hear the music! That's a pretty fair trade-off."
3,The lower bass is too subtle but articulate in others,"I think every today's IEMs are good enough in isolation, fitness, light weight, and even cosmetic looking because these features are much easier to achieve than sound quality.I compared Auvana with PX100. I also used Grado RS1 as reference(not for comparison) to make sure my recollection is right. The Aurvana sounds more articulate than PX100 in mid range. However, Aurvana has a serious drawback in lower bass range. It starts rolling off at around 50Hz. I still can hear 40Hz clearly but it drops too much db relatively to 50Hz so make it sound thin from time to time. Reproducing efficiently at 40Hz and above is very important. A lot of musics reach 40HZ and below but 40Hz is the key point. So Creative mush work hard to fix this problem next time."
2,Wreaked Havoc With My iPod,"These high-end headphones delivered great sound quality, but almost convinced me to return my iPod to the Apple store. I started hearing skipping, crackling and distortion in my music when I was running, but not when I played the iPod in my car. I thought it must be the Nike + iPod receiver at first. Only after a long process of elimination and considerable frustration did I figure out that the headphones were actually causing the problems.While the sound is good, these just didn't wear well enough to justify the price."
2,Comfortable but ...,"These are very comfortable, small and light, and they block the ambient noise very well. There are a couple of major problems however. One is that the chord is microphonic. It transmits a loud scraping sound to the earpieces when it rubs on your face or clothing. The other is the response. The only other earphones I have to compare it against are the Ultimate Ears Super.fi 3, (a.k.a. Altec Lansing UHP336). The Zen suffers very badly by comparison. It has an uneven frequency response with a bump in the mid treble range around 3kHz to 5kHz that makes it sound shouty. Another nit is that there is no room in the supplied carrying case for the airplane connection adapter."
3,Time for you to go... everyone's asleep!,"Just reading the set list conjures up the lyrics to ""MTV""... guys, it's the new music that keeps you exciting... We already have the 218 DVD's you've released with the older songs on them! Throw us a bone here..."
5,A must for a DP fan,Great to see the band with an orchestra. I saw them live with the orchestra and this is just a perfect DVD to keep those momories from the concet. It was shot using HD cameras so the picture is superv. There are extended interviews with band members as well.
5,Still great.,"After not seeing the band when they missed Colorado, I was very happy to get this. Knowing that Jon Lord advised Don on how to play Hard Loving Man, it was even better than I thought. It was good to see how songs like Woman From Tokyo and Knocking At Your Back Door were slowed down just enough to make them work better. Everyone does a great job. As for Ian's voice, the high notes are about gone, but there's still power and quality to the rest of it. Among other reasons, he had to teach himself to sing Child In Time way back when, so I think we should respect the man."
4,The Greatest Mass Murderer of All Time,"I used to read the Little Red Book every day. I had all the correct thoughts. I loved Mao. I even thought the Red Guard were cool when they ran all over China lynching millions. Actually I didn't know that, but commies can justify anything. Two hundred years ago, Edmund Burke said, ""There is no safety for honest men except by believing all possible evil of evil men."""
3,The writing itself is relatively unimportant,"While Mao no doubt had a profound impact on China, it was not for his originality of thought, but for the manner in which he promoted Marxism-Leninism. The only significant change he made in the philosophy was his realization that for communism to work in China, the Proletariat had to be interpreted as the peasantry. Mao's ""Little Red Book"" was a necessity in the creation of the mystique of Mao, and the cult of Maoism. This was not so much because of the ideas presented, but because the manner in which the were presented to the public, not only in the book itself, but through various other means of propaganda. Therefore the book as an item could be valuable to own for anyone interested in the study of Mao, but only as a tool in his mystique. Granted the book does provide some insight into Maoism, its most profound impact was based on its existence, and Mao would best be studied through his actions rather than through his writings."
5,This is a GOOD book.,"This book, along with The Communist Manifesto and The state and revolution one of the most important books for Marxism-Leninism-Maoism, and a most for EVERY worker. Read it, that's our tip./The Eastern Maoist Society"
1,Force-fed banalities by a totalitarian tyrant,"Mao Tse-tung was the most murderous, anti-cultural and anti-intellectual emperor of China since the first emperor of the Qin dynasty 2,000 years before him (a fellow thug whom Mao greatly admired and sought comparison with, by the way). In another atrocious irony that the history of 20th Century left-wing politics is full of, Mao launched a ""Cultural Revolution"" in 1966 whose aim was to destroy culture, and then mass-produced an anthology of his coarse and platitudinous writings which he forced the Chinese masses to memorize as the holy scripture of ""Mao Tse-tung Thought,"" an oxymoron if there ever was one. I hardly need to go into the enormous suffering the Chinese people endured under this monster and for those who tout this book on this page, it is evident that they know nothing about Chinese history, culture or people and don't want to know anything. Buy and read this book only if you want to become a mind-numbed robot like them."
1,extremely boring,"this is the most boring book i have ever read in my life. the only reason i read it was because i love to read politics and wanted to say i had read one of history's best sellers. let me tell u this book is short but it is one long, hard read. not for anyone who does not have a passion for politics. i assure you of that. i should add that in its own special way it can be seen to be humorous, at least if you find stupid intellectuals hilarious, as i sometimes do. after reading this book i am begining to see why the british use the word ""common"" in such a desultory context."
3,Answer me this please...,"If this is the 2nd most publicated book in the world, and it's no longer mandatory reading material, why can't I find a good copy for a buck or two?"
1,Mao The Dumb says:,"Mao TheDumb says:Dui di-ren ren-ci jiu shi dui ren-min can-ren. That translates to ""Showing mercy to class enemies is showing cruelty to the people."" This quote was used as Red Guards bashed and beat the bones of old men, bullied their teachers. When someone tried to defend the weak, the Red Guards would quote Mao, and continue beating, sometimes to death, their 'class enemies'.The Red Guards were the Taliban of China. Mao was their leader."
5,soup,It arrived on time and in good condistion. She really like it better then he thought he would. At a good price.
5,LOVE IT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I spent a whole weekend reading this book and the humorous and heart wrenching stories touched my very soul.Schnur 7321Party
4,Wonderful!,"This book was wonderdul! Finally they've made a book that I can really understand. This book really teaches you all of lifes wonders. I recomend this book to all pre-teens. It helps you get through teen life. Some of the stories in the book made me cry and some I knew I've been in that postion before, and it sucks! Maybe you could call it ""Shared experiences"" as others say. Once I was camping with a friend and I brought the Chicken Soup for the Teenage Soul 2 book along with me. We read it in the car and cryed most of the time. It teaches you what lifes really about. It tells you your not the only one out ther having all these meesed up problems! This book taught me there are more important things in life than looks or clothes, I really benifited from this book. I highly recomend it!"
3,touching but ....,"This book has a lot of touching stories. But after reading a while, I got fed up because most of the stories can be put into one formula: death + love."
1,chicken soup for the preteen soul,This book is horrible. I read one episode for my duaghter and it is about a father who forces his son to watch a dying deer as he eats venison. Then the kid finds a kitten and his mother makes his brother put the kitte to sleep. I was horrified. This is not realism. This is teaching your child cruelty. Do not give this book to a preteen until you read and vet it first.
5,Encouraging reflective thinking,"At our school site the Daily Bulletin is read by administrators. It combines important news with a brief selection whose purpose is to focus student attention on the importance of making right life choices. Unfortunately the anecdotal references and language used would be appropriate perhaps with students of two or more generations past and their point or moral is lost as students and many of the younger teachers are wondering who Horatio Alger or Thoreau or Rousseau are/were? Some teachers are starting a movement for a new text adoption and would wish to use any of the Canfield stories, albeit in an abbreviated form. We feel these narratives would resonate so much more effectively with our students."
3,Not what I expected,"I didn't really like the stories in this book as much as the othe chicken soup books....the poems in there made no sense, usually that's the first thing i read in chicken soup books -- poems."
3,Scraping works,"The only thing that really works on build up burnt residue is the scraper and elbow grease. This scraper was okay, but I couldn't figure out how to change the blade, so eventually went to the hardware store and purchased a regular scraper with a pack of single edge blades. It took a lot of scraping and time to clean the ceramic top, which I had neglected. The key is to not let build up ""build up"" and really clean the top every day. Either regular Cerama Bryte or any of the ceramic stove top cleaners work."
4,ceramabryte scraper,This tool is small for nice storage and use. The razor or sharp edge works perfect on my flat top stove for scraping off burnt on stuff before I use the rest of ceramabryte prodects to clean it. The razor appears to be replaceable.
5,Best ceramic cooktop cleaner!,This is the second time I have bought this product as I needed to replace my old one. This is the easiest and best way I have found to clean my ceramic stove.
4,CLK55,"Good product for the price, it was half price than what AutoZone and PepBoys charge. Quality is not the best, but does the work for now. Perfect fit for my CLK55 (w209)."
4,One of the greatest painters in American history,"Bierstadt was one of the greatest painters in American history. It's a pretty sorry situation that this seems to be the only major book on him in print. However, this is still a good book. Read it. Also, check my Amazon Listmania list on landscape painting for more books about the beauty of nature."
3,A devastating novel of prophecy and horror...,"""The Year of the Comet"" foresees a world split up, not into States and Kingdoms, but into a business Group. The hero is a scientist with a secret which will give supreme authority to any group in control of it. Inevitably he finds himself the centre of murderous intrigues. In the tradition of H G Wells and Jules Verne.""A devastating novel of prophecy and horror by one of the top writers of science fiction.""""In the 21st century a dedicated young scientist ordered to take over a top secret project has no idea that he will soon become the most dangerous man on Earth.""""When Charles Grayner, a dedicated young scientist of the 21st century became employed by one of the great ruling powers, he had no idea that he would hold the key to the future of civilization as we know it.""One in a series entitled Novels of Tomorrow"
5,Important reading for any age,"This is essential reading for anyone interested in art history as it outlines the lives of important artists from the Renaissance, one of the most important periods in all of art! Vasari spins fact and interesting tales together to make true history."
4,Necessary for art historians and college students,"Vasari's prose is effusive but easy to follow because it says the same things over and over about each artist. If you have any interest in the Italian artists this book is a crucial and reliable source of information. Artists lives with an emphasis on their contemporaries and their development are lavishly detailed in this book. It's a crucial source for a college-level art history report. Art historians respect Vasari's analyses of the artists' lives.Vasari LOVES the High Renaissance artists, especially Michelangelo and Raphael, so you'll find that those chapters are especially long and informative. At times the praise of these artists, and others of the Renaissance, seems exaggerated and excessive. But you get the general gist of things, and find yourself itching to see the paintings that he tells stories about after you read about each artist."
3,Don't buy your regular size,"I'll make this quick, Don't buy your regular size. Buy them two sizes larger, they run very small......."
3,Oh the humanity,"A lot more than the numerous films went into. There were those that were selfless and brave,or resigned to their deaths. And those that were not. Capt Smith went down with his ship , be it jumping into the water, or other. The arrogance to call it unsinkable. We learn about living from how these people handled this ships maiden voyage."
1,The Truth about the Titanic,"Sadly, I was greatly disappointed. One of the first books I just stopped reading because it wasn't good. I could never ascertain if it was truth or fiction and quite frankly, the writing just wasn't good."
5,A proud Gracie family member,"Col. Archibald Gracie is my mother's great-great grandfather's great grandson. Imagine my mother's surprise to learn last year as James Camereon's movie came out to find this world event linked to our family history! It was exciting, horrifying, and sad to read his chilling account and just feel lucky to be spared that kind of tragedy in my life. He was a hero and a very accomplished writer. I look forward to shaking more branches on my family tree. I will never hear the word ""Titanic"" again without remembering the souls who were lost more reverently and personally."
4,"Really does put the ""ha"" in Hardcore","Making fun of Straight Edge is a pretty easy (if unwarranted) thing to do, but Good Clean Fun manage to subvert the stereotype in a way that's not only inoffensive but damn funny too! Everything from the wry and surreal lyrics to the backup-crew vocals that sound like schoolkids just make you laugh at the whole hardcore punk stereotype - but laugh fondly! Veganism, religion, technology and (most of all) punk are parodied just enough to make hardcore fans laugh at themselves without being alientated. Favourites on this album are ""I Can't Wait"" ('2001, we call it quits the band'll be done...2004, to work, reunion tour!' - how many bands actually do this!), ""Beat The Meat"" and ""You're Only Punk Once"" (The shouted sidelines at the end of each line totally change the emphasis of the song). A funny, energetic album that's definitely worth buying - so go on then. Or aren't you harcore enough....?"
2,planned obsolesence,I really enjoyed the fan when it worked. But it died within 2 years of owning it and there is no way to repair it. I am sick of buying things that are built to break. I doubt I'll buy a Honeywell product again.
5,Great Product,"When I lived back home in England, this is exactly how Treacle tastes. It has some sort of different flavor, maybe because it was not freshly made and canned. Great for a quick sweet snack with a cup of tea."
5,Very good.,"If you haven;t had this stuff, try some. Its an import so it is pricey but it's one of those delicacy foods that is so worth it in the end. Its like a honey sponge cake."
4,Just like the original,"Heater core was received in a typical Amazon timely fashion. Packaging was correct for the product. It was a snap to install. This installation was in a Pickup with zero dash interference. Only seven screws to remove the cover to expose the Heater core and remove the hoses. 15 minutes later it was finished, a total of 45 minutes and I was on the road. No issues whatsoever"
2,"No Seals Included, Not OEM Size","The Good: Very fast shipping and well packaged. The Bad: As stated by other reviewers, the foam side seal is not included with this core as stated in the description and because it is an after market part it is thinner than the OEM one that is installed on my 93 Chevy x-cab truck. I went to local parts stores Advanced and Auto Zone and they had the same style as this one also with out foam seal. Had to go to local radiator repair shop to get OEM/AC Delco heater core that was full sized. The radiator shop said this would have worked for me it was just that it did not have as much surface area as the original and would reduce the amount of coolant in the engine a little bit. The AC Delco core did not include the foam seal either. I found it available from the local hardware store for about four dollars for a ten foot roll."
4,Nice watch for the price,"I purchased the watch from a different site, and it was almost perfect. Almost because you have to ""wind"" the watch every two days or so. By wind I mean shake it so it winds itself. I called Seiko usa to make sure. Also the description says white face and it does have a white face, but the picture looks grey/silver. It can be deceiving. Overall a really nice watch with some weight to it and nice stainless steel. PS if you see a watch or anything on Amazon and you really like the price, GET IT! because the price might go way up a week or two later."
2,Disappointing,"Before reading this book, I read Michener's Hawaii. Because Hawaii was an absolute masterpiece and my favorite novel ever, I was really excited to read Caribbean and had huge expectations. So imagine my surprise when I found the book really boring! I could hardly read it and just skimmed through much of it and finished it just to get it over with. I hear Mexico is pretty much the same. Chesapeake was ok. If you want great Michener books, read Centennial and Hawaii, especially Hawaii. But skip Caribbean. It is very long and very boring."
2,Michener blinded by his own assumptions.,"Michener once again poses as objective historian whilst force-feeding his own narrow-minded assumptions on anyone still reading his books. Although CARIBBEAN has some interesting sections, the author's thinly-veiled prejudices come shining through. The book is nearly half over before the narrator gives any attention to a single black character. His dismissal of Carib Indians is shallow and redundant. And he completely trashes Rastafarianism as a deliberate attempt to misread scripture in order to get high and scare whitey. This last dose of intolerance is utterly indefensible. Coming from the author who defended the rights of white South Africans to seize and oppress, CARIBBEAN gives thoughtful readers one more reason to discard Michener's imitation scholarship and reach for some real wisdom instead."
4,Epic,"Like all James Michener's novels, this one doesn't fail to provide an epic look at the region and its history as well as a gripping story. Thanks Mr. Michener, from a lover of all things Caribbean."
5,very enjoyable,"i have to say, this is the first michener book i have read, and i am pleased with it. i like the way the chapters are arranged, and it reads almost like a collection of short stories. i have very limited time due to work, school and kids and the arrangement of stories allows me to pick it up and leave off without missing a beat."
4,Well written but too much for one book.,"The first few chapters of this work were absolutley riveting. However, I get the feeling that he felt the book was getting too long. It seems that the last few chapters were cut beyond recognition or he just threw them together. Many of the characters in the later chapters were barely explored. It was definitely not equal to Hawaii or Covenant"
4,FOR ANYONE WHO LOVES THE CARIBBEAN,"This is the first Michener novel I've read. It's taken me about five years to finish. That's not necessarily an insult. As Stephen King put it, Michener writes textbooks disguised as novels. Actually, ""novel"" might not be the correct word. I wouldn't even call it a novel in short stories. In reality, it is a series of novellas, loosely connected, forming a history of the Caribbean from the Native Americans to the 1990's. As such, it works beautifully. Here, we get the real history of the Pirates of the Caribbean, the reasons why Christopher Columbus is such an ambiguous figure in history, and the tumultuous history of Haiti. Over the years, I've read a bit here and a bit there. As I said, it can only loosely be called fiction. Yes there are characters but the stories are so sweeping and there is so much history to cover that Michener must do the work in broad strokes.Let me put it this way - now that I've finished it, I'm probably going to start reading it again."
3,Ghost Hunters wannabe,"Not much happens on this DVD. If you've watched Ghost Hunters, you know the drill. While Shane and his friends had some ""personal experiences,"" they aren't terribly convincing to anyone not experiencing them - that is, the viewers.The production values are good, and the cost of the DVD is pretty low. But at 66 minutes, it still seems overpriced. Especially since those 66 minutes are pretty dull."
2,It wasn't THAT interesting :(,I was disappointed overall -but I have to give Shane Free props for pursuing what interests him and filming it. I like his passion and enthusiam -but nothing on this DVD made me jump or squirm or feel weird -ever.So -pretty dull even though I'm interested in the paranormal. I just didn't get into it personally -sounds like a lot of folks on here loved it. So watch it and see what you think :)
2,Not what I expected,"I did not even finish this one, it could not hold my interest, and I was surprised that it was reviewed well."
2,Eh...,"I don't care for the creator of this film, he seems kind of off-putting and it makes me weary to trust some of his findings. The fact that he snuck the Ouija bored into the hotel room and didn't respect the owners beliefs and rules about having it in the inn bothered me a lot. That being said, he seems almost like a kid in a candy shop, and he seems eager enough to ignore the inn keeper's rules in order to capture evidence, and so a part of me thinks he wouldn't make anything up for that reason. He is am amateur though, and a lot of his evidence reflects that. Its a cheap film, and if you're bored I would suggest renting it, but I wouldn't look too much into it...after all, there is a reason why Ghost Hunters rejected him."
3,Good first try,"Glad this was only $1.99 to view. It was a great first hunt for someoneinexperienced. Was expecting more, but the best part was the creepylaugh at the Prospect Place. Wish there could have been more. I reallyhope he gets a lot more evidence in future videos. I wish him luck. Ghosthunting itself can be an amazing reward when you get something that isunforgettable. Good luck on your future endeavors."
2,dissapointing...,"As an avowed fan of the paranormal, I found ""Investigating the Afterlife"" a bit dull and predictable. Not much different from what is shown on TV's documentaries of the paranormal. Mysterious noises, footsteps, doors that open or close on their own, unexplained lights and shadows showing up in pictures, etc., etc. For me, the DVD did not show anything new of what is already being featured on this documentaries. Admittedly a waste of money."
3,afterlife,bought this book for my sister and she hasn't read it yet so i can't tell you if it is any good.

1,Poor design,"Although advertised to fit a 1996 Suburban, they do not. The tab on the back is not aligned and it doesn't fit flush like it is supposed to."
1,Bad!,I bought this product to help untangle my hair after I wash it. So far any .99 cent conditioner would do a beter job.
5,Humorous and chilling,"Chris Bachelder's Vonnegut-esque novel tells what will happen if the mass media successfully penetrates our consciousness enough to make their messages and our thoughts indistinguishable.The ""Bear v Shark"" obsession echoes many aspects of our own culture, including sports and religion.For the record I'm pro-bear."
3,Which is more annoying....,"It poses the question of which would win, given a level playing field, enough water to maneuver, but not so much the bear couldn't keep its purchase: a bear or a shark. The style of the writing, however, asks if it's more annoying to watch network television, or to read a book written in sound-bytes, commercial breaks, and slogans. I liked reading it, but I also like watching television, foreign-language commercials, and amateur videoblogs, so I'm really easy to entertain."
2,At Least It's Over Quickly,"I'd call this book a waste of time, but since it only takes a couple of hours to read, that description is inaccurate. Nontheless, I can say it contains nothing of value. Any critics likening Chris Bachelder to Vonnegut need to re-read Cat's Cradle or Slaughterhouse Five, then publish a retraction."
1,Not funny. No real plot. Poor satire. Not well written,"I was greatly disappointed with Bear V. Shark. I expected something funny. It is not. I expected satire and political humor, it has none. If the author was trying for a book like, ""1984"" or ""Brave New World"" or ""Fahrenheit 451"" or ""Animal Farm"" or ""The Jungle"" he missed by a huge margin. Truly good satire tells a story, and makes a message. BearV. Shark does neither.The book is so inconsistent and difficult to follow that it becomes almost unreadable. It reminded me of the ramblings of a psychiatric patient (was that the author's intent?) I did finish the book hoping it would wind up in a glorious manner, but it just plods along and ends.None of the characters are in any way believable. None of the situations are engaging. None of the attempts at humor are funny. I was really, really disappointed. Did the other reviewers actually read this book?"
1,"I paid a buck, I paid too much","This book is unmitigated, self-indulgent crap. I hope Mr. Bachelder has spent his advance and is now pushing lattes for a living, having had the smirk permanently wiped off by the deflation of his marshmallow-light contribution to the landfills of the culture he seems happy to hate."
5,Knowing the future helps,"In this very readable and helpful book Bewes sets out to remind us of the greatness and inevitable triumph of what we as Christians belong to. His point is that we are part of Christ's Kingdom, the stone that unavoidably, inexorably and relentlessly, in Daniel's dream, grew to become a mountain. This is a vital vision for us in the 21st century. He says, ""If we lose sight of that, then with the rest of the world we shall lurch on, baffled by every twist and turn of this chaotic age.""He writes simply and clearly, and with great illustrations from history, from his own vast experience, both worldwide and in a busy multicultural London congregation. Here is a book that will encourage you to keep going and growing in the Christian life. As he says, ""Knowing the future helps.""And for those of you who haven't yet checked it out, he also has a superb little commentary on Revelation, ""The Lamb Wins."""
3,George Madis might not have had good 'facts'.,"Several experts and researchers in the firearms history field have been advancing questions on the factuality claims, regarding many aspects of Winchester firearms history and production, being presented by Mr. Gadis in several of his documents. Beware investing this level of your money in something that may not be 100% factual, or suit your intended end use. A lot of what he says is OK, but you might not be able to rely on very part of it as being proven factual."
5,Trip Down Memory Lane,This is the early Daniel and is so revealing of Ireland and how much Daniel loves his home.
3,Pretty good,"Yes this Cd is good, with the exception of the most unnecsary song at the end. I dont know why everyone is putting down Sabbra Cadabra by (hed)P.E. I mean if you in the mood for slow trippy music that is the song. Its like the coolest song on there. But this Cd is devestated thanks to busta ryhmes who does a song somewhat like Iron Man , but talks about his N words. Thats all it is, just him saying F and the N word. and then ozzy comes in like twice. All the songs rule except the last one, which should be recalled just to take that song of the CD."
4,just as good as the first NIB... well almost,"i must say i like this tribute also. while i think the first NIB is slightly better i still think this one contains great interpretations too. while the remakes done by pantera, megadeth and monster magnet and primus are suprisingly mediocre, especially slayer, (hed) p.e., machine head, soulfly & system of a down did good songs. slayer is the high point with their relaxed but energetic version of ""hand of doom"", also (hed) p.e. delivers a cool funky version of ""sabbra cadabra"", system of a down adds a fast and light version of ""snowblind"", machine head and soulfly deliver good, if not to new aggro versions of the original songs. the busta rhymes song is indiscussably bad in my opinion. overall a not always worthy tribute to the great masters, still a decent album"
3,Nativity in Black II - One Of Best Tributes In World,"This Edited Version do not lose nothing for the original version. NIB II have the best band's of heavy metal: Soufly, Slayer, Pantera and Megadeth but the first tribute continue the best Sabbath tribute."
2,"Wow, two good songs!","Unless you love numetal, don't buy this album, get the first one instead! This has two good song on it, System of a Down doing ""Snowblind"" and Slayer doing ""Hand of Doom"". The rest is worthless. Pantera's cover of ""Electric Funeral"" is ok, but it's annoyingly identical to the original (Iced Earth's version is WAY better). ""NIB"" with Primus and Ozzy isn't bad, but they cut out all the solos to make it a radio hit. That's just wrong, man. And once again, WHY IS OZZY SINGING ON HIS OWN TRIBUTE?! Does that make any sense?Like I said, just get the first one. This is crud."
1,Do yourself a favor. Do not buy this terrible CD.,"What are you people taling about? This CD is terrible! All of the songs have no spirit. They stink. Godsmack and Machine Head disgraced Sweet Leaf and Hole In The Sky. I cannot believe Black sabbath gave these bands the permission to use those songs. Then there are the rap versions of Sabra Cadabra and Iron Man which are absolutely terrible. By buying this Cd I have lost all respect for Slayer. I have all of their CDs, but after hearing their version of the classic ""Hand Of Doom"" I wanted to bury my head in the sand. Megadeth's version of ""Never Say Die"" was just as bad. Shame on them both. The only listenable tracks on the CD are... 1. Pantera: Electric Funeral (the only good track) 2. Primus (with Ozzy) N.I.B.Don't get this CD!"
3,The first NIB is better,"I heard the Nativity in Black part 2 , and except for Slayer , Megadeth , Pantera & Primus which are the best covers on this edition ,the rest of the tracklist (well System of a Down & Busta Rhymes renditions are ok)didn't do much. I prefer the first edition instead."
4,Not bad for not actually being sabbath,"To start, no one can ever be as good as sabbath. so of course these ""renditions"" if you will CAN NOT be as good as the originals with the ONE EXCEPTION. nib by primus w/ ozzy. OMG what can i say. other than the fact that it did have ozzy in it. les claypool just ripped it up. i had never heard primus before, no i went out ant bought their cds. system of a down did a wonderful job of redoing the great snowblind. pantera's electric funeral was very close to the original so that was a plus. slayer did an awesome job of redoing hand of doom. but my second favorite was megadeath's never say die."
2,Not worth the Buy,"This is a rather poor tribute compared to the first NIB album. That album was a decent listen. Every band there put their own spin and style into the songs. In contrast, many of the songs on NIB 2 are nearly copies of the originals classics. There are only a couple winners. The stand-out track on NIB 2 is Soulfly's take on ""Under the Sun"". I also like Busta Rhyme's version of ""Iron Man"" a lot despite the rest of the reviews here. Even if you don't like rap, you have to admit that he made a new-song out of the material unlike the rest of the ""artists"" on this album. Megadeth and Pantera both give good performances except their covers are barely distingishable from the originals! The rest of the tracks go from ok to terrible. You can skip this record. Instead, spend your cash on ""NIB 1"" for a good pop-metal disk or ""Eternal Masters"" for a great hard-core metal experience."
4,NIB2 - Excellent Disk....Minus Track 12,"NIB2 is an excellent addition for anyone who enjoys ozzy (or any of the bands on this disk). The Godsmack, Primus and Pantera tracks are some of the best renditions I have ever heard. An excellent tribute to Black Sabbath; their influence on today's rock/metal bonds is enourmous. Only downside of this disk is track 12. I was unaware that Black Sabbath had much influence on today's rappers. Track 12 is a very obvious mistake, I had to re-burn the disk and remove it."
4,Lovely Bible Study,"This has been a wonderful bible study. At the end of each chapter, there are reflection questions that really make you think about your vocation as a wife/mother. Everyone in my bible study group found their marriages enhanced in some way as a result of the changes THEY made from progressing through the book."
5,PS3 Yellow Light fixer,"Purchased this heat gun primarily to fix my Playstation 3 Yellow Light error. Works like a charm and am happy I have this tool to fix my toys and save money on labor charges. As always, fast shipping from Amazon.com.jose-"
1,Stopped working after three uses,Ceramic pieces inside of unit are very brittle and become detached with use. Pieces find their way into the fan mechanism and jam the motor so the fan will not rotate. The unit is useless at this point. Mine lasted three or four uses over six months.
1,didnt last,This heat gun died on me last week after 7 months. I used it within the manufacturers guidelines and it just died.
1,Didn't Last...,"Despite good reviews, this heat gun died after a few days of light use. It flashed and growled suddenly then stopped working. I let it cool down but it still will not turn on again. I will be returning it to Amazon and buying a different one."
1,Do not buy,I had this gun about 6 months before it just quit working. Save your money and buy something else.
2,Motor fried in a shower of sparks!,"Had this for about a year - used lightly, in a home/hobby environment. Works great for shaping plastics, Kydex, etc. Last week I went to use it, and the motor exploded in a grand shower of sparks as soon as I turned it on! It's a pity, because it was otherwise a nice unit and reliable up to that point. Probably had a total of 20 hours of ""on"" time before it fried. Now I have to get a new heat gun... I won't be buying this same one."
1,Doesn't Last,Quit working after about a dozen uses over nine months. I got a total of maybe two hours out of it. A waste of money.
1,Kawaski Heat Gun - broke in one day,Used it for one day and it quit heating and blowing. Do not buy.
2,Stopped working after a couple months,"The gun itself (while working) was great. Unfortunately, in the middle of an install it just stopped dead. Not sure what happened. Opened it up and look for any possible loose wires only to find that everything was in, seemly, perfect order. Just stopped working. Waited til the next day to see if possibly it was just overworked....nope. Tossed in the dumpster. I'd go with a cheaper version, or just get a lighter instead."
4,Good heat gun so far.,"I bought this heat gun to remove ICs from circuit boards that a normal soldering iron would have a difficult time doing. I've only used it a handful of times so far, but it hasn't let me down yet."
2,"Nice toy, poor training device","The hardware itself is well-built. The display is high-contrast and easy to read, and the buttons have a good feel and are laid out rationally. The problem is with the software.The biggest problem is the fact that this device has the dealer stand on 16 (hard or soft), not 17, making the device useless for practicing Basic Strategy. There are a few other quirks with the software. A player's three or more card 21 wins instantly--no push against a dealer's 21. Also, the dealer doesn't expose his natural, allowing you to double-down or split against it and lose twice (but also allows you to surrender against it). You are only allowed to double-down on a 10 or ace, a rule seldom found in shoe games. An ace-9 combination shows up as ""10"", not ""20"", but settles the bet correctly if you stand. And due to screen size limitation, you must stand on any six card hand; fortunately, so must the dealer.All in all, a nice toy, but not a serious blackjack trainer."
2,Not a top quality blackjack toy for the money,The blackjack game does not exhibit odds. You can't double-down on multiple hands (Las Vegas permits you doing this). The hit button is overly sensitive--two cards are dealt instead of one. I question about the true randomness of the cards dealt.
2,Not as Sweet,"I really wanted to like this Cd,and tried many times.The vocals are very pleasant but get lost andconfused with all the high-hats and vibraphones.Just a little too much fusion for me.But I bet they are really nice people!"
2,NOT MY TASTE,"Sarah Vaughan is considered a great jazz vocalist. But her type of jazz is not for me. She is almost always accompanied with symphony-like support and mostly sticks to a classical jazz repertoire. The reason she does not appeal to me is because she is technically perfect to the point that each song seems like an exercise in control, which she does have except when she quickly drops to a much deeper voice. At least, that is my perception. I find little emotion. If you like the classical jazz repertoire, you will likely find her very appealing."
5,Excellent!,"Scott Rezendes captures the adventure, mystery and excitement of intertwined crime, religion and family drama on an international landscape. His book is both captivating and leaves the reader wanting more. Someone should make a movie out of this story line.Very entertaining reading that draws you in deep and deeper into the struggles and adventures of Toni Brazil!Thank you!"
4,It was pretty good.,"This book was very well writen and was one of my all-time favorites. However, it does have some aspects of unrealism. The ""F-19"" never existed. I think he just put it in there to give NATO a fighting chance. Otherwise, the Russians would probably have won, unless NATO used some special trick so that they would win."
1,TOO DETAILED,this is clancy's most involved and boring book.do not buy it. instead try hunt for red october.
1,Red Storm Rising,Availability should read: 2-3 months.. Not 10-14 days..I ordered this on Feb 13th and it STILL hasn't shipped yet. Don't bother buying it here.
4,Amazing Detail,As with most Tom Clancy books the attention to detail and the complexity of the action story is amazing. At times I felt the many action scenes were a bit repetitive but kodos to Clancy for writing a scary account of how complex and terrible a modern war between heavy weight forces would be. The only clear winners would be the arms dealers and those who make the weapons.
5,Clancy at his best.,"This, along with 'Without Remorse"" has got to be Clancy's best work, right up there with Hunt for red october. If you are a Clancy fan or a first time reader put this one on you're list."
5,Red Storm Rising,Always an excellent book. Have read several times. Each time the book has kept my excitement. A potential classic especially for style.
5,Second time reading,"This is a great book. The first read was while I was stationed in the 11th Cav. in Fulda, Germany. The second read was just recently where I tracked military movements using Google. Clancy did a great job in being factual in this book."
5,Excellent!,"RSR clearly excels, even without the beloved Jack Ryan. Wonderfully accurate battle scenarios, and the romance on Iceland, although perhaps not up to the standards of Danielle Steele, provides a touch of humanity to the hardcore military and political themes. I would recommend this book to most people, but military nuts (like myself) would enjoy it most."
4,Great book...lot of OCR issues,"The book is a classic...one of my favorite books. I am reading the kindle version, and there are issues with optical character recognition. I becomes '1', 'rm' scans as 'm'. Tons of these issues. It is not hurting my enjoyment of the book, but for $6 plus, you would think that someone would proof the kindle version.Or, another way to put this review is 5 stars for the book, 2 stars for the OCR."
4,WWIII possibility,"A wholly possible scenario for World War III without the threat of a nuclear holocaust. Clancy includes many technical military terms that are less known to the general public. Despite the vernacular, the story moves along well. Some parts may become confusing, given the five or more subplots used to tell the tale. A well written stand alone piece by the author of the Ryan series Hunt For Red October and Patriot Games."
5,Best book I ever read!,"This is the best book I have ever read. I have read a lot of military books and this one is the best. I have read ""The Hunt for Red October"" and ""The Sum of all Fears"" and this one is better that both put together! Can't go wrong with this book. Its exciting all the way thought.Simply put Great Book."
5,I had to do this...,"My son, who HATES to read, actually read this book. While he was in high school. And he loved every single word! For me, there is no higher praise than that."
4,This Book is a smash!,"I feel that Tom Clancy's ""Red Storm Rising"" is one of the best novels ever written. It gives great detail of real wartime scenarios and the dialogue is quite believable. However, the whole idea of Russia, or the USSR in this case, would make such a foolish power play is absurd. One, they wouldn't stand a chance against American air superiority. Also, Russia's government is in such disarray, the offensive would probably fall apart before it began."
4,"Slow to start, but picked up quickely.",This is the second book by Tom Clancy that I started reading and almost put it down too. The first few pages of Soviet politics were dificult to wade through. I kept on reading and the story started to make more sense and the action picked up. I liked how the book showed the NATO-Soviet war from both sides and the details made the story believeable to me.
5,Quite Unnerving,"I have just finished reading all of the Tom Clancy books, and I have to say this is my favorite. During the course of this mainly Jack Ryian odessy, I cam back and read this book 3 times. The first time I found it exciting, but I was rather confused by some of the technical details. The second time through I concentrated on figuring out what was going on in the parts that I didn't understand, and once I did, I reread the book. This time through I found myself identifying with many of the characters. Morris seemed to remind me of my uncles, and I thought that these people seemed totally realistic. I would recommend that anyone who has the time (it took me 2 months, 3 weeks, and 4 days to read it twice) to read such a book."
3,This book is more like a technical manual,"This book has a great beginning, but it is more like a naval operations technical manual than a novel. Some of it is hard to follow for us laymen, and the ending is quite predictable. This book is not a part of the Jack Ryan series. This is a stand alone book. That is what makes this book interesting to me. But again, it was hard to follow because I am not familiar with military operations, weapons, and equipment. This one is for hardcore Clancy fans, submarine fans, and military afficiandos."
5,Perfection epitomised,"Red Storm Rising is an excellent book. Not only is it entrancing, it's realistic. For example, in the book, the American tugboat does not sink a Russian carrier, as some other American authors would write. He makes it seem real, and because of it, it's a non-stop page turner. Clancy is awesome."
5,the greatest book,this has to be the greatest book ive read its a little long but all and all it is the best.
3,Good Read for 1994 but dated for 2010,"I loved this book when I first read it although I'm not sure Clancy's references to advanced military technology are as applicable to the weapons of today. Unlike other books based upon war, Clancy does rely more on the fact that he is presenting something futuristic. The many years that have passed since this was written has muted the excitement over something he presents as futuristic and yet the reader sees as old technology.I only wish that Clancy would go back to writing books where he spends more than a few months between releases. When he spends some time on a book, he can be a very engaging writer but when he cranks 6 books out in a year, the quality of his books drop immensely."
2,Not what I thought it would be,"I love Tom Clancy. In fact I can safely say that Cardinal for the Kremlin is one of my all time favorite books. So when I heard that there was a novel out there about WWIII with soviets I jumped right on it.Big Mistake.I was expecting a book about major battles and world changing events. I was expecting to see the world structure change right before my very eyes! Although this is a great concept, I feel like Mr. Clancy spent too much time on minor things.******SPOILER*******I don't care about 3 men stuck on hill 142. I didn't want to hear about the personal feelings of a submarine captain. I wanted to read about major world changing battles, and got nothing of the sort."
1,XR41s and Tri-whammers,"Okay so I made those words up. They're not actual military terms. Buried in this Tom Clancy book though, I doubt that anyone except submarine and naval experts would even notice. I've never heard of an author doing TOO much research for a book. I think Clancy lost touch with the everyday reader if he thinks anyone would understand enough of the jargon he spews here to care about this book. And when jargon is all a book offers (characters? what characters?) the book, to put in simple, non-Clancian terms, SUCKS! Clearly it's not the dumbest book I've ever read, but it is the worst. I make it a mission never to stop a book once I've started, and never to refuse reading a book given to me. This book made me question the value of such a mission. Too boring, too long, too technical, too empty."
5,This is the best book I've ever read.,This is absolutely the best book I have ever gotten my hands on. This book is the pinaccle of my Tom Clancy book collection. The story line is so believable that it makes you worry that it's really going to happen
3,Early Clancy,"Very early Tom Clancy, and it tends to read a little too much like a video game. Once Clancy found his main character and actually had a character to work the story around his work dramatically improved."
4,red storm rising is a fun read,"This is my first Tom Clancy novel, although I have seen several movies based on his books, all of which I enjoyed very much. I think if Red Storm Rising had been about 100 pages shorter, it would have been wonderful, and the author would not have lost any of the suspense he manages to create with the great battle scenes and political machinations of the Russians. I thought the story line about the guys running around on Greenland could have been shortened by 2/3 and the book would have been more succinct and suspenseful. I think Clancy wanted to inject a bit of romance into this techno-thriller, but, since he is pretty hopeless with in-depth character development, this component fell flat and could easily have been eliminated. Anyway, the book is a fun read, even if the equipment used in this version of WWIII is quite dated (reflecting the date of the book, of course). I plan to try a few more Clancy novels."
4,A good story but some parts are slow.,"This book was not one of my favorite Clancy novels. The techno-warfare is accurate and well-researched, and there are a number of exciting parts, but there are also some parts that are slow-reading, drawn out sections that I found boring and/or tedious. I think too much writing was spent on character development for the Clancy fan who is looking for an exciting adventure story that moves at a good clip. The contrast between The Hunt for Red October, which reads at a much faster pace, and Red Storm Rising is vast. I think this book is worth reading but one should be prepared to spend a disproportionate amount of time reading the story."
5,My First Real Novel Read and probably the best!,"I am ten years old. Red Storm Rising was reccomended to me by my mom and dad when I told them I was sick of books with treehouses etc... My dad is a Tom clancy reader and so is my mom and RED STORM RISING was their favorite novel by Tom Clancy. I got my hands on the hardcover addition in two days and read one-hundred pages in three days and I couldn't stop reading. It is deafinatly worth reading if you like weapons, soldiers, and planes. It contains every type of lethal weapon in the world. The description is great. READ IT!!!!!!!"
3,"Good, but too technical.","Red Storm Rising is a good book, but it could have been better. I enjoy a good war novel, however, there were many acronyms which were either unexplained or explained much later. Too many characters are described in depth, only for the reader to find out that after reading a 2 page description of ""whoever"" that they won't ever hear about him again. The Hunt for Red October was much better, but the best Clancy is Without Remorse."
5,Views From A Vet,"This book is so realistic for it's time is is frightening! This book is the first public mention of the Stealth program. That alone is frightening since we know what we know now. Since I cannot give a view from any other than Air Force, I can't vouch for the rest. But from my memory, everything here is as accurate as can be, even with inside info."
5,Red Storm Rising,"This is the best Clacy book I've read yet! It has everything: dog fights, naval and sub battles, and land battles. The characters are believable as are the plots and sub-plots. Very detailed and accurrate. It is a long novel, but it never drags and I couldn't put it down. I cannot remember a weak moment in the book. This is a strong novel, and the ending will surprise you, and leave you wanting more of Clancy's work!"
5,Clancy's Best,"Hunt for Red October was great, but I still think this is Clancy's best work to date. It's a huge novel, but a dramatic page turning great read! I re-read it at least once a year because it really is that good."
3,WorldWar3 for couch potatoes,"RSR (Red Storm Rising) is the story of an war launched by the Soviet Union against the West after a Muslim terrorist attack on a Soviet oil depot. 700 pages later the Ruskies loose (of course)The picture painted of the Kremlin and the Russian military seems plausible enough to a western reader, as does the buildup to the war and the deceptions used by the Russians to keep the West off its guard. In classical action fiction style, it has several strands that intertwine and we have three heroes to guide us along - a Naval Intelligence guy, a US submarine commander and an U.S.Air Force weather forecaster in Iceland. The aircraft carrier Nimitz is bombed, Iceland is invaded and a fierce land war wages in Germany. We jump from front to front witnessing the action including rather too much time spent (for my taste) at sea and underwater. The pace is good but the book is too long. There's only a taste of romance, and that's in Iceland. Enjoy."
2,Poorly typset Kindle edition,"I love this book, but it's a far better experience in print than in the Kindle edition. The book appears to have been transferred to electronic form with OCR and poorly proofread. Many of the alpha-numeric abbreviations are mangled and throughout the book you find tell-tale errors, like ""c"" for ""e,"" which leave you looking at nonsense words. Worst of all, in this case, are the myriad ""m"" for ""rn"" errors which turn almost every nautical use of ""stern"" into ""stem,"" which carries the opposite meaning and is truly confusing."
4,Red Storm Rising,"Red Storm Rising is an amzing book that takes place in WWIII. It happens when the USSR declares war on the middle east and NATO after they were attacked by easterners that lit their gas and oil plants on fire.The USSR is now taking control of the war and trying to fight the USA. The final battle takes place in Iceland with the main character Bob Toland who leads the attack which finally make the Russians retreat. This then ends WWIII.Tom Clancy is an amazing writer. He shows you this by showing what are societys real problems are. Such as, are dependecy on oil form the midlle east. This book is a must read."
5,Excellent story,This is early Clancy novel presented in a Larry Bond-type format. This plot involved an entirely different set of characters than the Jack Ryan series. These characters were developed and quite believable. I am disappointed that Mr. Clancy hasn't brought back the Air Force Lieutenant and his Icelandic damsel for a Jack Ryan novel.
2,A good idea made into a bad novel,"This novel is very long and boring.When Clancy describes the submarine battles,the text results heavy and very difficult to follow.In fact,the novel contains too many technical details about the weapons.The book would be better if it contained more references about the persons.And I have to say that I think that this novel has a excess of 400 pages.(The Spanish edition of Plaza y Janes has almost 1000 pages in small format)"
2,Boooooooring...,"Well, first of all, I have no respect for anyone who attends fundraising dinners for Oliver North, but I gave this book a try since ""The Hunt For Red October"" was pretty entertaining. I've tried three times get through this book, but to no avail. The plot is quite interesting, and there are some good moments, but the whole thing is bogged down by endless, redundant battle scenes that do absolutely nothing to move the story along. This book would have been great if a couple hundred pages (no exaggeration) were edited out. Tom Clancy could use some pointers from Frederick Forsyth, Jeffrey Archer and Joseph Finder. They do this stuff much better."
5,Nostalgic read...,"I read this book in the '80's when it came out, and recently re-read it. It is somewhat dated, given the political changes in the last 30 years, but to me, I think it's one of Clancy's best works."
4,Red Storm Rocks,"I was alittle skeptical about this book. I had not read Clancy before, and I'm normally a reader of SF and Fantasy. I have to say however, that I was completely blown away by this book on every level. The plot involves a Soviet oil disaster which forces the Soviet government to attack NATO to recover their oil. The war that ensues is amazingly told by Clancy. One note I feel should be made is that the book was written in the mid 80s, and so is a bit dated, considering the ""Soviet"" government is not there anymore, but it's easy to read around that :)"
5,Brilliant! Action-packed!,"This has to be Clancy's best! It's packed with nothing but military action. If you want to read a novel about war, without all the political, economic, or technological commentary (as in some of his other books), read this one! My favorite!"
3,The first techno-thriller I ever read and the best...,"...but, regretably, a disappointment. The real stars in this book, indeed this genre, are the hard, cold mechanisms and bloody, detailed carnage while the characters meander throughout stereotypically automated, from time to time illustrating, almost emphatically, some emotion to convince the reader they are human afterall, androgynous background to explosions and esoteric borax. This is as much an escapist, guilty pleasure for the armchair soldier as Harlequin books are for SOME housewives. What this book does it does well-give a cheap thrill."
4,Please! Not ANOTHER submarine battle......,"First off, this is really a great read. You won't be able to put it down......just what you expect from this guy, right? My only gripe and the reason it doesn't get 5 stars is the number of redundant submarine battles that he goes through. If I have to read through one of these one more time I'm gonna jump in front of the next torpedo I see and commit Hare Kare! This book is really long and could have probably been trimmed down a bit and this is one place I would start. Red october didn't have this much redundancy to it.Still it's an excellent read and gives really good insight into modern warfare. Check it out at your local paperback trader!"
5,Why?,"Every time I read this book, I wonder why they couldn't make it into a multi-week series, like ""Lonesome Dove"" or ""Gettysburg."" I think the Hollywood movies on Tom Clancy's books (not including Hunt for Red October) have gotten ridiculously far from the plotlines, and I don't even bother with them. But something made as a series would work. ""Without Remorse"" would beanother great one for that format.This is an excellent book, it's a non-Jack Ryan book, and it moves right along. I wish it were another 200 pages longer. It's that good."
4,Red Storm Rising,"I thought that the book Red Storm Rising was and amazing book.Its starts off with middle eastern men lighting oil factorinies off in Russia. Tom Clancy shows how well WWIII could eaasily happen in his story.This is a story about the russian governmant declared war on the middle east and NATO. It shows how one coutry can be defeated so easily. Tom Clancy also shows how our world that we live in is so dependent on oil and gas, and how if one thing goes wrong countries attack each other.Overall, this was a great book about the trigger affect. That if one thing happens it will set of a chain reaction. It also shows th main character Bob Toland and hes fight on Iceland to retreat the Russians. This was a great book about modern day war."
2,Severe Printing Errors,"I have not yet read the entire book, though I do quite enjoy what I have read, this edition of the novel suffers from some very severe printing errors. Namely, the first 3 chapters or so are out of sync with the rest of the book. The first page of the book is page 16, and there seems to be fragments of a forward and an author's note printed throughout this section. The rest of the book appears okay, though."
1,Poor Quality Control; Many Errors,"The product is sub-par. There was no quality control, no review of the text. There were numerous errors, especially spelling errors. Just because you can run a spell check and get it to pass does not mean that the words are correct. Poor, poor quality. If you won't spend the money and time to produce a good product, I won't be spending my money on Amazon books in the future."
3,Very used,I bought this to re-read and the book was very well used. It was readable but began to fall apart before I completed it.
3,Three Stars for WWIII,"Tom Clancy's reputation had me expecting a little more from his first project. He did demonstrate a mastery of military technology, procedures and jargon. Thank God WWIII never happened in this way, this book will make you count your blessings. One of the things this book seemed to be missing was the human side of war, the only exception was the activity in Iceland which was excellent in that regard. The book was very entertaining and there was a lot of heart-pumping ACTION. For my next Clancy I'm going to try Without Remorse which is supposed to be a little more character-driven. Many writers strike it big on their first try and subsequent efforts seem to miss the mark, my gut feeling tells me that Clancy's work only got better with time and practice."
2,A terrible story that uses mediocrity as it's paradigm,"This story lacks passion, character development, and most of all, an interesting plotlines. Their is no crucial conflict, no culmination, no threat that either side may win or lose. The story lacked intensity, and made of for it with it's exceptional reality. However, reality may work for some fiction, it did not for this one. Overall, I think this story used mediocrity as it's paradigm"
5,The Soviet UnionAttacks,"This book starts out with a Muslim terrorist group attacking, and destroying, 30% of The Siviet Union's oil supply. They all ready have a horrible economy. The oil loose will probably comepletely destroy their country. There descion is to attack the countries in the Middle East. The UN defends them and the whole thing turns literally into World War III. There are mainy stories going on throughout the book. All are expertily written. This book is, in my opnion, Clancy's best."
4,O.K.,"I like it because it's not like other Tom Clancy's books which are conected (Op Centre, books with Jack Ryan...). It's clear that Clancy is navy man, as ground battles are not described as detailed as naval (air battles are a bit more detailed, but not much). Don't you think, that with US involved in Europe some other state would try achieve it's goals (remember how worried US were when involved in Kosovo)? Maybe Koreans would do something. But all in all, it's good book."
5,The best World War III book ever!,"I read this book in the early 1990s. Since then I have re-read it several times. Simply the best World War III depiction of the 80s and 90s. A great read even today, even if the Cold War is long over. The introduction hardly lasts 70 pages, and then its unfettered war, war and war. Brilliant!Unfortunately, Clancy's work has deteroriated in recent years. His latest sponsored work, EndWar was a huge disappointment of an old man stuck in a Cold War past. Fortunately the pool of creativity is endless and new authors are replacing old has-beens. ""War against Islam"" by George P. Robertson is the Red Storm Rising of 2008. Another great book is Caliphate by Tom Kratzman..."
5,GHOST RIDER,This figure is so freakin awesome lot of articulation only problem is that he doesn't sit on the bike two well but over all a great action figure.
4,Horizon HX370S hand held,This radio is built tough. Very heavy but solid design and waterproof.Easy to understand controls. I like this radio to monitor ship to shore.Have not tried to transmit yet. But overall great radio.
4,Very Good Illusion,"Great illusion, okay quality. The stickers started peeling off on mine a bit. But, I would still recommend. Easy to learn for the beginner and instantly resets. Don't perform twice in a row for someone at the same sitting."
5,A must have for every Christian's bookshelf.,"Wonderful book, convicing evidence in favor of keeping a seventh day sabbath, a wonderful, short explanation, very concise;to the point. Recommended!!"
5,Really good read,"I'm not 7th Day Adventist, but loved this book anyway. God instituted a day of rest at creation. If He rested I guess we should too. Since He did create us He would know what was best for us."
2,For clueless guys only,"This book is for guys who have absolutely no idea about how to please a woman. The book reads like a technical manual, reducing sex to a series of specific tasks, and telling us how women supposedly respond to kisses and touches. Not all women will respond in the same way, and the important thing is to be sensitive to the clues she is sending you, not to necessarily spend x amount of time kissing or touching one specific part of her anatomy. There are better books on pleasing a women, e.g. ""The Sex You Want."""
1,its a rip off.,"There is only ONE page of useful info in the entire book. I am not kidding! ONE page. Everything else is fluff to sell a book. I thought it might be fun to read in bed w/ my girlfriend...negative.the one page has a fairly accurate diagram of the vagina w/ some arrows that say ""rub here.""Everything else was crap.And a waste of time.I guess if you are a terrible lover who doesn't try and please your woman - it could be marginally useful but not in comparison to most texts out there.If you know it's important to get your girl turned on before going to work than all you need out of this book is that one page. Look it up on the net and save your money."
1,Really Awful,"Only 7 pages of this 132 page book actually deal with the g-spot, the rest reads like a horrible dating manual for idiots. We don't need a book to tell us what to talk about over dinner. I am not kidding. Rather than addressing the topic at hand, the author speaks down to the reader as if they have never met or dated a woman previously. We were laughing hysterically at the first few sections until realizing that the whole book read like this. Absolutely stupid and insulting, you would do better studying the Wikipedia entry on ""g-spot"" and Penthouse Letters."
3,Help for husband,I bought this book to help my husband. He really liked the book but it didn't help as much as I had hoped it would.
1,"""Dating for Neanderthals"" would be a better title!","This book was the most useless book I've ever read! It didn't have much to say about the G-spot except a mere 7 pages out of a total 132 pages. The rest is pretty much author's self promotion of his technique that is ironic since there is none!The title should have been ""Dating for Neanderthals"" or ""Dating for sexually retarded""... Believe me it was insulting to read! The author just assume that anyone who is reading a book about sex must be a total moron that has never dated a woman much less touched one! I've read a lot of books about sex and by far this purchase was my biggest regret! If you already know that a woman should be aroused in order to enjoy sex and you know how to search for G-spot in Wikipedia, this book is already way below your level of intelligence!"
2,Lacks spirit,"I guess the title says it all, step-by-step. Too mechanistic and simplified. Does not delve deep into the true nature of the beauty of women and orgasm. Like something you'd read in a Mens health magazine or cosmopolitan."
5,NOT only in California,"I have this book at home(California) and love it. I bought a copy as a thank you gift for friends we visited in another state. They too, loved the book. Great recipes, lovely water colors, reader friendly!"
5,Perfect for keyboard/piano players!,"My mother bought this book for my birthday. I was so excited! I love Fred Hammond's music. I never really took music lessons and I don't play the piano much. The notes are very easy to understand and follow. If you're like me, and have misplaced the words to Fred's tapes, then you will be happy to find out the words are provided in this book. Perfect when you are teaching the song to a group of people."
5,Garmin Zumo 550 gets it done,"I purchased the Garmin Zumo 550 and installed it on my Honda VTX 1300. The installation was very easy and the left handed function works very well. First trip took me directly to the address I wanted with no problems. Diplay is easy to read in all lighting. Device is easily moved from bike to car. Only suggestion I recommend is to purchase the key lock for the mount for the motorcycle handle bars. Really enjoy the speed, direction and milage the unit displays while traveling. Audio in the car mount it excellent."
5,Beyond Expectations!!,This unit rocks. I have never been so ippressed with a product like this before. Garmin even has a free update to the latest maps for new purchasers. I highly recommend this unit for anyone looking for a dockable unit for their motorcycle and car.
2,Buggy Software,"I've had the Zumo 550 for just over a month now and during that time it has locked-up in the power off mode multiple times while in the cradle. The only way to get the unit to power back on is to remove and re-install the battery using a 2mm hex wrench (not included). The unit does have some nice features but its lack of dependability make it more toy than tool. If you're considering a purchase check out the ZumoForums online. There are multiple accounts of new Zumos with the same problem I had. Kudos to Amazon for shipping out a replacement (I had owned the unit a few days too long to qualify for a refund, which I would have preferred.) but my discussions with Garmin and others' experience doesn't make me hopeful that this will have been a good investment."
2,why so expensive?,Garmin Zumo 550 3.5-Inch Portable GPS Motorcycle NavigatorThe voice is hard to understand. Searching takes a long time and sometimes it never finds it. For a few hours it just stopped working then it started working again?? I don't think the screen is all that great. The speaker and microphone on the bluetooth are terrible. Everyone says they can't hear me. I'm not very happy at all with this product. I have a toyota gps that works great and I have an older Magellan that runs circles around this Garman product. I hope it's really water proof!!
4,Zumo 550,"Would have given 5 stars if the Zumo hadn't stopped working a week after I bought it, yep I said stopped working! I was gonna get really pissed but then called the tech help number and the girl on the other end was very helpful and got me going again in no time. Still not sure what happened but it hasn't happened since and as long as the GPS is working I love it!!! Takes care of all my needs on the bike as well as in the car. Wish it wasn't priced so high, but none the less I would recommend it highly!"
4,zumo 550,"I do like my Zumo, it gives me more confidence when I am out riding. It seem like every time I pick it up I learn something new about it. There are things that could be more user friendly and the help book could be a lot better (it is only on disk) but it I had to it again and would purchase the same thing."
2,Buy a map!,"I made the mistake of letting this thing choose a backroads route for me only to find out that it took me 80 miles out of my way. This wouldn't be so bad if I hadn't been riding for 10 hours already and was in the mood for some site seeing. The software for the unit needs HELP! It will not let you easily alter a route it has chosen for you. The mapping software on the PC is much easier to manipulate. So, either plan your every move before you leave home, buy maps as you go or take your laptop with you.The MP3 player and photo viewer work well.Purchased from Beach Camera - Fantastic retailer!!!!!!!!!"
1,Garmin from Amazon,"This product is advertised as ""new"" in box and is definitely not. The first time I ordered the product it came in an open box with stickers off of the unit, no shrink wrap around the box, cables undone, etc. I was upset because of the price I paid for the item that was represented as brand new. I sent it back to Amazon and they assured me this would not happen again. The next unit that was delivered also was opened and not new as advertised.I have heard the product is great, I just would not recommend purchasing from amazon until they can get their advertising correct."
4,Garmin Zumo 550 does what they say it will,"Easy to use right out of the box, simple motorcycle mount, bright screen, yes you can easily use it with gloves on. Only two complaints are:1. secutiry screw can be overcome by simply untightening the wing-nut on the motorcycle mount. 2. Car mount is a little bulky when bringing it on the plane when traveling. Sandbag type mount to set on dash would be better. But all in all, very good product, works well...then thought of just about everything with this one. Being able to pull up gas stations, hotels, shops, Harley stores, etc. in new riding locations is a treat! Works great on bike, and looks good too!"
3,Buyer Beware,"Bought this item on Amazon.com. They provided one of those ""Buy this item with..."" and recommended a carrying case. I clicked on that option. What they didn't tell me was that a case was included with the GPS unit. When I went to return the extra case that they recommended, I was told that I must pay for return shipping because it wasn't Amazon's fault. The GPS itself is great. Easy to set up, and all of my address book is accessible."
1,Problem,A great gps when it works. Stopped working three weeks after receiving. Received a replacement that only worked for a week.
2,Broke down in 3 weeks,Product just quit working 3 weeks after I got it. Sent it back to manufacturer (Garmin) who said they would have it fixed on a priority and over-nighted back to me. That was almost two weeks ago and have not gotten it back yet. Still waiting.
3,"Zumo, not worth the money","Map quality pales in compairison to Google maps. My iPhone with Google maps gives far better, more readable maps. I'd use my iPhone over the Zumo except I often ride in areas that don't have cell coverage, therefore I have to use the Zumo."
5,4 years and still going strong.,"I've had the Zumo 550 for nearly 4 years. I also use it in conjunction with the Garmin X30 (XM Antenna) for satellite radio. It's been used in the driving rain, freezing cold (Illinois Winter), and hot summer days (in Florida) and has performed near flawlessly. Only one time can I recall the unit locking up on me, but by removing the battery I was able to reset it and continue on my journey. If you purchase any Garmin GPS, I high recommend buying the Lifetime Map Upgrade. It's worth it!"
2,Poor support for defective Zumo,"I paid around $800 for my Zumo and it was defective right out of the box. The features are great, but mine just wouldn't turn on sometimes. Unfortunately the unit waited 17 days to act up, too long to return it to Best Buy, so I turned to Garmin. Tech support couldn't solve the problem so they requested that I return the unit.They wouldn't just send a replacement unit, they want ALL the parts, including the ones already mounted to the motorcyle. In addition, they rewarded me with the pleasure of paying for shipping to return it to them. Customer rep. said she didn't think it was right either, but it's ""Company Policy"". I used this unit on one trip, and it left me stranded. Thankfully I had maps. Now Garmin is taking a few more bucks out of me. Cheaters never prosper Garmin! I'm in a loose/loose situation. Pay the blackmail money, or be stuck with a defective unit. Not a happy camper!"
5,How did I get along without it?,"The Zumo is a work in progress. It's being constantly refined and updated. This is a good thing in that all improvements are easily added to the older units through Garmin's excellent customer service programs. It's easy to use and very accurate. On a recent ride, we had the Zumo along, but not loaded with a route. We were familiar with the roads we were riding until we decided to explore a new route that would eliminate having to ride on a freeway. We became a little (OK,a lot) lost. Normally we would have rode around until we found our way back, but with the Zumo along, we simply pressed the ""Go Home"" feature and it led us flawlessly out of our situation and home. Love it."
4,Zumo 550,Easy to use! We love it! I would have liked to have known about the extra parts required (for motorcycle use) to be able to use it to it's full capability. Such as wiring harness and special antenna for XM radio. But otherwise it has been one of the best extras we have purchased for the bike. We have already used it on several long trips and are planning a 9 day trip this summer. It transfers easily to the car or truck with little effort. I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a GPS for a bike.
2,"""Garmin, you have failed me for the last time.""","I was tired of the 15 minute start up times, the touch screen that couldn't stay calibrated, expensive map updates and Garmin's useless tech support. Now I have a Magellan 5045-LM.Life just got better."
3,Shipped item not new in box,The package was not shrink wrapped. It was obviously opened. Never received anything like this from Amazon before.
3,Garmin Zumo 550 and Mapsource City Nav NT 8.0,"Hardware:This one is quite good, and I give it a 5 Star rating.Easy to use, fairly intuitive, and WebUpdater software for updating the firmware inside the unit. Good brightness for motorcycle riders that have no shielding from direct sunlight (as car drives do).Glove friendly is not just a selling point - it works quite well.Software:Routing is mainly subject to the included Garmin Mapsource City Navigator NT 8.0 which is included and pre-installed on the unit.Once routes are transferred to the unit, they seem to work well.Software is dismal. One star rating is kind.I use MS Streets & Trips and it routes well, and has more granularity over the options and preferences in the routing tools.It would seem that Garmin is a hardware company, and software us just a liability and not an asset. I have two previous versions and find no substantial differences between them.The average is therefore 3 stars."
5,My ZUMO 550,"I always said I would not have a GPS especially for my motorcycle. Well this unit is fabulous. Very user friendly, easy to read, easy to program & easy to switch from one menu to another. Great product."
4,Zummo 550,This really is da bomb for a motorcycle GPS. I have had 3 others and after much research went with the 550.I would go 5 stars but like others may have mentioned.... the MP3 player cannot be used unless the unit is in either the car cradle or the motorcyle cradle with external power connected. The headphone jack is part of the cradle not the GPS body. What this means to me is... I can't just pop it off the bike and listen to music in my tent/hotel or around camp. It is not a dig deal since I have a mp3 on my cell phone but it would be a nice feature to have.
4,Great GPS!,"I love the garmin. The same day I got it it went on the bike. You do not need any kind of voice directions on the bike due to great screen with advanced instructions. On the included car mount, it talks great! It has elevation figures and it gets signal from the satelite right away. I am really happy with the unit, it's also super sturdy (it looks like it would do fine if it's dropped). The only thing I can think of that would make it better, it every time you have to navigate somewhere it asks if you want to go somewhere in your state. This gets kind of old and I would it rather assume I am going somewhere in the state, if not I should have a key to say diff state! But this is a super small thinkg! Buy with assurance and enjoy!"
5,Solid,"I've had this for about three years. It works like a charm and is as solid as a rock. During the cold weather months, it resides in my SUV, but in the motorcycle riding months, it makes sure I get home when I'm wandering on two wheels."
5,very very good product,"I cannot say enough good about this unit I have had it in 4 diffferent units. 'pickup,car,motorcycle,quad. On each unit it worked with not one problm. I would put an address in and it would put me with in 10 feet of my dest. If you went off corse it would reroute you right now. The only thing that I could see wrong with it is the speed did not match what I was in, but that could be the vehicle I was in. Over all I am very pleased with the 550. papajoe"
1,The Complete Fraud,"This book pretends to be ""A Comprehensive Dictionary .....(of) Military Terms"" But most of the entries are not military at all, and a a majority of them are surely known to any third grade child... I want a refund on the money I spent for it!."
3,okay,"This clutch ball has a nice scent and my baby could grasp it easily. My baby was interested in it for a couple of days, but he is not as interested in it anymore. He prefers a larger size Crocodile Creek ball that we have."
4,An adventurous life,"Enjoy thoroughly. William Spratling's life in Mexico, was a unique and exciting one. His retelling of some of the most remarkable moments of his life are poetic and interesting. Has been very usefull to understand his personality , since I'm writing an essay about him. I recommend it fully for someone wanting to know about this period in mexican history."
2,Cute but not sturdy at all,"This book shelf did not last long at my home, I had to replace it after about one year. It started rocking from side to side after a few months and the books started leaning forward and falling out. Would not recommend it for homes with children under 5 years old."
5,great vest,"Bit pricey, but by far the best vest for kids. Only one ours will keep on because it doesn't ride up around their necks."
2,Rack Failed,"Used this for about 6-8 months commuting 13mi to my office, carrying my Dell latitude laptop in the MTX office bag (compatible with the rack). This past week, the rack fractured, dropping my laptop into traffic. I got very lucky that it wasn't run over. Rack fractured just beyond the top weld. Worked great until then, but I wouldn't be able to trust using this rack again. Seen similar reviews of these racks fracturing like this in the same spot."
3,"Medieval plot with lots of sex, gore and bad guys.....","I actually didn't find this boring which is why it got 3 stars. I have to admit it. I got the book because I thought it would be sexually graphic. What can I say. I bought it because I was traveling and you need something to keep you entertained in an airport. Well it did. It won't win any literary prizes but it had a story line, well developed characters and plenty of sex. All kinds of sex so it should please anybody. Only at the end did it seem like the author got a little rushed and the lead female's sudden attraction to another female character is never fully written out and so you are left feeling confused because her actions make no sense. But all in all it was entertaining."
5,Excellent Product!,"Thanks for getting this item out so fast for me! it is exactly what I expected, and came sooner than I thought it would!"
2,Jewsof China:Historical perspective vol1.,The book detailed only a few famililys ans failed to provide the scope of activity among the broader jewish families at largre. An index of sur- nnames would have bee usseful.
5,"A Klassik, A Privvielge, and a Grate Book","Krazy and Ignatz are always fun to read. Herriman's artistic and literary genius shine through. If a person has never read a Krazy Kat compilation, this one is a great one to begin the journey to Cococino County."
5,Super Cute!!!,This is such a cute hat...My daughter looks so cute in it...Can't wait for the weather to cool off so she can wear it out!
2,i bought it WRONG DVD,ok movie ....... but i know i bought the wrong DVD......... it is ok ..........old movie but ok movie
2,the big town (vhs),My Husband wanted the movie on dvd but all I could find was vhs so I ordered it for him he loved it the first time he watched it but the second time he tried to watch it it wouldn't work . It would not trac.
2,"Big Town, Little Movie","Matt Dillon stars in this Ben Bolt movie about a young gambler from the 50`s that goes to Chicago in order to improve his life. Diane Lane and Tommy Lee Jones also give standout performances here, and most of the cast is convincing enough. The problem seems to be Bolt`s direction, entirely average and bland, which doesn`t provide any particural memorable moment or scene. There are no impressive camera-angles here, so what counts is really the plot. The worse thing is that the plot is just adequate yet nothing special either, presenting a typical rags-to-riches storyline with cliched characters and unsurprising situations. The acting makes it work in a mildly interesting manner, though, so the movie still manages to be an entertaining pick for a rainy day. ""The Big Town"" is another average film worth watching once and be done with it.Not a keeper."
3,Lacks Depth.,"Viewed: 12/12Rate: 512/12: I blame the shortcomings of The Big Town to the director. What Ben Bolt failed to provide is depth to the characters. I mean, it would have been nice to see more character development in Tommy Lee Jones, Bruce Dern, Lee Grant, David Marshall Grant, Tom Skerritt, and Suzy Amis'. That is the frustration of the film. The casting, except for Diane Lane who isn't much of an actress, is perfectly fine, and Matt Dillon is right for the role. The topic is no problem with me, and the settings and the atmosphere are well orchestrated. But, please try to put in more depth in the characters to make the picture meaningful to watch. All in all, The Big Town is a lot better film than The Cincinnati Kid."
5,Excellent,"You will love this book. I purchased this book for required reading for a bible class. If you want to learn about the practical applications of Joshua, this is the book. It is fairly easy reading and you don't need a degree to understand it. It is very biblical and will help you understabd how God used Joshua as a leader in the early days of Israel's history. I fell in love with this man of the bible. I think you will also."
4,A low-key masterpiece,"This is one of the most subtle Japanese contemporary films you'll find. Despite being a live action drama, it starts with an impressive and densely symbolic animation sequence that quickly establishes the pace of the fantastic story of real-life writer Edogawa Rampo struggling with... well, you'd better find out yourselves.I think anyone interested in Japanese stylists like Kurosawa, Ichikawa Kon or Mizoguchi should see Rampo. I gave this film only 4 stars because of the transfer to DVD. I saw an older VHS edition the first time, then I bought the MGM DVD, and I was surprised to find the quality of both editions is pretty much the same. Which is really a downside for a movie with the amazing score Rampo has.Anyway, I strongly recommend this movie to anyone interested in good filmmaking."
2,Never Adds Up,"The first 10 minutes promises a very bold and decisive story but, alas, other than a few snippets of lovely visuals and music, it lets us down. Perhaps if you are a novelist whose real life gets intwined with your fictional characters, it makes more sense. It's a very symbolic and impressionistic film with a lazy script."
1,Japanese Artsy Fartsy,"This film is an ego trip for the director.After the movie is over, you say ""So what?""This is the kind of movie the French call an ""artistic masterpiece"". That should tell you everything you need to know about this film.Thank god I bought it used."
1,a disappointment,"I decided to watch this film in part because I'm a big fan of Japanese film, in part because it features two of my favorite actors, and in part because of the extremely positive reviews here on amazon. The film started out well with an interesting animation sequence, but as it progressed it turned into a cinematic version of a supermarket trash romance novel, only with a less engaging plot and a ""mystery"" of very little interest. I love slow-moving stories, but here the story is so thin I found myself dying to hit the fast-forward button to speed things along. The cinematography and effects are ""beautiful"" only in a cliched, soft-focus, daytime TV kind of way. This soap-opera-esque melodrama is dull and embarrassing. There are so many great Japanese films out there . . . try something else!"
4,Spooky!!,"A colection of all kinds of ghost stories from headless horseman, polgergiests, spirits that are hundreds of years old and even ghosts coming back from the dead for revenge!!"
3,Borrow this book from the library,This movie is MY favorite movie and the book is quite a bit different from the movie. If the movie was not my favorite I would just borrow the book from the library rather than have my own copy.
2,another unrealistic bit of nonsense,"mrs pettigrew saves the day- all day everyday. a shabby stranger walks into someones world and completely saves everyone from themselves. she gets loaded all day long, then saves herself!!!!!!!!!!! how absurd."
3,fun cinderella story,"Fun & fast-paced Cinderella story. Miss Pettigrew is a 40ish, poor excuse for a governess who knocks on the door of a flamboyant singer/actress one morning and it changes her life forever.I recommend checking out the publisher: [...]it sounds like they have published a number of forgotten books with a updated preface."
4,BOOK IS AS GOOD AS MOVIE,"YES THE BOOK AND MOVIE ARE DIFFERENT, HOWEVER, THE MOVIE DID BRING TO SURFACE THE UNDERLYING TONES IN THE BOOK."
4,"Fun, whimsical read","I had never heard of this book until I saw a movie preview by the same name. I haven't seen the movie yet but it is on my DVD must see list. The book is a fun read! This reminds me, I was going to look for more books written by this author."
4,Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day,Delightful. Like a Barbara Pym souffle topped with the best whipped cream. Miss Watson writes like a female Noel Coward.
4,An interesting lady,"This was a good book. It was a bit long, in that the whole book is based off of one day. It was interesting, in that I wanted to see what would happen to Miss Pettigrew, overall a good book, glad I got to read it."
5,Delightfully British,"Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day: a delightful, classically English story about a woman put into a situation completely out of her element, who surprises herself and rises to the occasion. An amusing, light, easy read that I enjoyed. The movie diverges quite a bit from the plot of the book. While I enjoyed the wonderful acting in the movie, I preferred the book's plot."
4,"My Rifle My Pony & Me, Still GREAT after all these years!","I really enjoyed the CD, especially the title Song. Does anyone know where I can buy the guitar sheet music for this song? I've looked all over the internet but just can't find where it's available, at any price. Please let mek know: ddfreitas@cs.com"
5,Movie soundtrack,"I am a huge John Wayne fan and I loved this song; wasn't sure I could get it, but glad I found it. Thanks for prompt service."
2,Disappointed because...,"The reason I purchased this particular CD was for the title song. However, I did not appreciate the fact that someone dubbed in an introduction by John Wayne that begins just before the song starts. What was the point of that? Who wants to hear John Wayne speak every time one plays the song?"
5,I Look Toward Home,"This album takes me back to Texas. ""The Sons Of Katie Elder"" sung by Johnny Cash and ""Nevada Smith"" sung by Merle Kilgore sound good but are a bit modern. ""The Searchers"" sung by the Sons Of The Pioneers really hits home. As the sun sets and the days grow short I ride away and I look toward home."
4,Westerns fans rejoice,"Mant of the songs are recognizable. However there are some clunkers. Some of the songs maybe on the movie soundtracks but you never heard them in the movie. On the whole an enjoyable album, but don't expect too much"
4,"More Duke music, PLEASE!!","I wish someone would put together all the great music from the films of John Wayne. Imagine ""I'll Take You Home Again, Katheleen"" from ""Rio Grande"", ""The Searchers"", music from ""The Quiet Man"", along with the songs from his films that are included from this cd (which I've just ordered), on one cd. Come on, somebody step up to the plate here."
3,not true to size,"these shoes are nice looking and comfy. However, the run a bit too big. I'm a size 9M and initially got that size for me in black. They were about 1 1/2 inches too long and wide. I got an 8 1/2 in oak next and they were still big. I'm a size 8 in these I guess. So, i suggest you order it a size smaller than your usual. The black is much nicer than the oak."
3,Still a fan!,"Sims 2 on playstation has promise, but I think the game makers held back with this game. I was looking for more than what this game had to offer. I loved The Sims Bustin Out and The Sims Urbz so much I was looking forward to the Sims 2 on playstation. It doesn't really fair as well with Bustin out and The Urbz. I hope there's another playstation Sims on the way with a lot more to offer. The graphics are really good, of course, but the gameplay itself is frustrating and slow."
1,Very Disappointed,"I loved the sims and I am up for any good sims game. But this one is the only one I do not like. There is barely nothing to do and the only thing good is all the items, which take forever to get. It's extremely sluggish too. I know ps2 sim games aren't the fastest thing but this one was extra slow, it froze up my ps2! There wasn't enough tasks to do. I rather play the sims 1 game with the worser graphics because at least it was A LOT more entertaining. The big thing is you can't even have a baby and that sucks big time. My big problem with this was that it wasn't fun and even though the graphics were very improved they sometimes froze or took forever to do something. So I recomend sims castaway, urbz, busting out...anything but this one. You won't like it and you'll be bored in a day or two."
1,Not the Sims 2,I do not like this game at all. The graphics are awful. I even like the first Sims for the Playstation than this one. I feel I was ripped off paying $50.00 for this farce. I have the Sims 2 for the PC and all the expansion packs and I love that game. I feel like I'm getting somewhere on that one. You can't shut the aging off so don't know if on this game they age or not. Don't know if the they even have kids and if they age or not. Also they work 7 days a week just like in the first one. I don't recommend anyone buying this one. I wouldn't buy any of the other ones they have either because if they are anything like this one it's just a rip off.When I went to make people I didn't get many choices on anything and the people looked and walked just like they did on the first one. They should never have called this one Sims 2 because it sure isn't.
2,Bustin' Out was more fun -- this is a step backward,"I bought this on the first day it was released. What a disappointment. It has less functionality than any Sims game -- as far as building or dressing people or aspirations or....well anything.The aspirations are stupid. For example, if your main character hires a maid that doesn't stop someone else in the house from wanting to hire a maid days later (even though the maid is walking around in front of their face!). How dumb is that!!The control panels are clunky. You have to pause the game to go find out when your character has to go to work or what they need to advance in their job. Plus, your PS2 will grind constantly and don't even get me to talking about the terribly slow load times!!Bustin' Out was way more fun -- more action and with a lighter sense of humor. Plus you can buy it cheap -- instead of this overpriced, uninspired mess."
2,Fun for awhile...,"This game was fun for little while until the more I played it the more I realized their wasn't much to do. Sims 2 is better played on the PC version on the computer. Sims wasn't made for the PlayStation 2. You can't build big houses because of the fire code; you build your house to big with alot of stuff inside it could catch on fire. One thing I loved most about the Sims is the ability to create my dream house, and I can't do that with the PlayStation 2 version. This game should just stick with computers and not game consoles."
1,Eh..,"This version has a way different feel to the computer version, but I bought it a long time ago when my computer didn't have the juice for the game. Overall, it was very boring plainly because there was nothing to do. I did find it fun in it's own way... before the data corrupted and I lost it all."
4,Total control of the sim = BEST,"So you can't have babies. No big deal.You can however control your sim completely (in terms of movement). Never again did I miss the carpool just because my sim decided to freeze up! There's an exceptional amount of customization tools to pick from, including the introduction to alien skins. Plenty of items to design your house with as usual. Its a pretty enjoyable game.I didn't purchase it from amazon, but I remember owning it on ps2. In the future I just may buy again."
3,Fast Shipping,Seller was very fast on shipping item. Item arrived in perfect condition.. Would recommend this seller.. Game was ok. But will tell you all that I got the new SIMS 3 for the PS3 and would rather play the PC version.. You get more freedom to do what you want.. Very disappointed with the PS3 version.
4,Improvement from previous Sims games,"A humorous edge, great locations to visit, and a better story mode. Improved graphics from the previous Sims games for PS2. Awesome direct control/godmode toggle. More interactive objects through third person mode (and cooking, socializing, etc) Not bad in general.Some issues: AI still seriously lacking. Doors getting blocked so sims refuse to move or walk through. Sims taking the longest possible distance to walk to an object. Often difficult to simply interact with other sims. Minor problems in interface such as having to pause the game and scroll through a bunch of sims to figure out what their relationships are. Pausing the game every time you need to know which skill to improve to advance in your career. Could have made it a little more user-friendly.Overall, a lot of improvement and depth added. Recommended if you are a Sims fan."
3,Some entertainment here,"My ten year old son wanted the DS version, but since he didn't have the DS yet, he got the PS 2 version. He said it was not the same (he played it in his cousin's DS). He liked this game, but not so much. Finally, when he got his DS plus Sims 2 for DS as a Christmas present, he said that this is what he really wanted, and has not walked away from it too far ever since."
2,PS2 version only a shadow of the PC version,"As a true Maxis fan, I was disappointed to say the least when I eventually discovered the PS2 version of ""The Sims 2"" was nothing like the one played on the PC. There are 3 big reasons why I regret purchasing this game:- You cannot become pregnant or adopt.- There are no Genetics, Family trees, etc.- There is no agingThe whole point of ""The Sims 2"" was to develop GENERATIONS of sims and take each sim from a child up to a senior citizen. In this games defense, I will say it did provide hours of entertainment.Honestly, The sims series just is not meant for a console like PS2. The sims series is a PC game, and when transferred to a console you lose so much of what makes the game great.I love almost every game Maxis has ever created, even my least favorite Maxis' games are ranked above some of the more popular PC games.A rare miss for Maxis."
1,Where are the children?!,"I bought this game 3 days ago. I have to admit that it's addictive and amusing.. but when I found out that you're not able to have children, I freaked. Creating and raising families was the main reason I bought this game.The PC version is absolutly incredible, but since my computer does not meet the system requirements, I can only play it when I visit my friend.Really, I have no intention of playing the console version anymore, I'm ready to take it back. I'm completely dissatisfied."
4,Good Game,a very good game until i finally finish decorating my house and the robbers come in and steal some of my furniture. very dissapointing
3,How to have kids/ How good it is,"It's alright, but the PC(or Mac) version is wayyyy! wayyyy! better. I haven't played the ps2 version yet, but I've played the gamecube ver. (it's the same, don't worry) The clothes are pretty interesting, acctually, but after you build up friendships and maybe... love - the game does get pretty boring.How to Have Kids:~da-dun-dunn-daDUN!Listen up, simsloving kidStep 1. Go into storymodeStep 2. Go into your familyStep 3: You, are so stupid. If, you were a hard-core fan, you would have already read the online FAQ's/Guides and found out that... YOU CAN NOT HAVE KIDS!!Why do you think that there are no -Family- Aspiration! It's filled in w/ Art! In the PC you have -Family- because you can have kids! For anyone who has it knows what I'm talking about.Anyway, sorry 4 being so cruel, but it sort of obvious. Please read the FAQs/Guides?Cheats for Sims 2 PS2. It will help a lot!"
2,charger,The charger did not meet our expectations so we returned it. It would not charge a battery that it claimed it would
5,Good product,"I really like this charger. It has a lot of power and it's much lighter weight then most others that have this amperage. Some are so heavy they need wheels, but the SE 3010 can be carried easily. I highly recommend this product."
5,Calvary love,Not for the faint of heart. Only for the saints will to lay their soul life down for their brothers and sisters.Remember as you lead the difference between conviction of the Spirit and condemnation caused by introspection. This book can bring an awaking of real love.
5,Over and over and over,"I am constantly reading this book. There is so much treasure in this small book. I get something new everytime I read it. If you want perspective, inspriation and you truly want to self examine yourself, then read this book."
2,Definitely Not a Mrs. Hudson Favorite,"I have read a few of Davies' books with Sherlock Holmes housekeeper,Mrs. Hudson solving the murders. This one does include Sherlock andDr. Watson lending their voices to help Mrs. Hudson in finding a wayto prevent the Malabar Rose from being stolen. However it is stolenpractically from right under the noses of Mrs. Hudson, Flotsie,Sherlock's maid, Dr. Watson and the police. It is one of thosemysteries that seems impossible that it happened even tho'it did.My problem with it is that it goes on and on and on (and on) withnot alot happening. this is definitely not a ""can't put down book"".You have to force yourself to keep coming back to it as you willhave to know how this crime was done. I know this is a Mrs. Hudsonbook but it certainly does not show Sherlock at his brightest."
5,Great String of Solid Tunes,"Years ago I played this album to death. Recently I went looking for it only to find the label out of stock. I can still hear Plain Jane,Wounded in Love,Falling in Love, This Planet's On Fire,ringing in my head.We've got to have this available again soon. If for no other reason than to showcase an example of how to make an album/CD.I wasn't the biggest Sammy Hagar fan, but I'm sold on this work. Not a weak one in the batch."
4,Great CD,"I love Trans Am. This is a great late 70's cd, I would recommend it. Classic Hagar before Van Halen!"
5,Sammy Rocks!,"Sammy Hagar ""Street Machine"" is just one of many great albums from The Red Rocker! A must for any true Rock Fan's album library!"
2,"Format is Awful, and Very Distracting","Attempting to read this on my Kindle, I found it extremely distracting because the lines are cut off before the return, so there is a long line of words followed by a trailing word or three on a very short succeeding line, followed by a long line and then a short one again. It's almost impossible for me to enjoy a book that is so visually confusing. I wish I had known...Reading it on my Mac is much better because the window simply shows the full wordage on each line, although the page seems rather narrow compared to other books. I imagine it would work just as well on an iPad.Smollett himself is delightful, but this version renders it difficult to appreciate him."
3,Cut Off Image,"I ordered the wood poster. It's nice, good quality. The actual image is cut off though. It's missing some scenes, one of my favorites at that. Very disappointed in that. It's like a memory being cut off."
2,Cropped,"I bought this print as a placeholder for when I'd have the funds for a larger, higher-quality print. The colors are dull, sure, but it's expected for such a low price.I was very surprised to see that the piece itself is cropped in a significant way. There are actually scenes missing. This print was $1.39 when I bought it, so I can't complain too much, but it's certainly not worth the price they're asking for now. Whether you're looking for something framed or something cheap, do yourself a favor and make sure you're ordering the complete piece."
4,Versatile Dinah,"This CD has something for everyone. Dinah changed and evolved as a singer thru the years (some critics accuse her for ""selling out"" to pop) and her voice grew rich and soulful as well. There's the early Dinah from the mid to late 40s with songs such as ""Long John Blues"" ""Slick Chick on Mellow Side"" where she's only backed by a trio and guitar. Record company did a good job restoring sound quality on the earlier recordings. You can hear Dinah's voice mature thru the years. As the years go by you can hear the different accompanists---orchestra, strings and violins---it all shows how comfortable Dinah was in each and every musical setting. The later pop smashes are here too ""What A Difference A Day Makes"" ""This Bitter Earth"" ""Unforgettable"". She truly was unique and versatile. No wonder she boasted to the public ""I can sing anything, anything at all..."" She wasn't boasting at all. Sound quality is very good to excellent."
1,Wish I had seen the previous review before wasting my money...,"Our past few years Christmas night tradition with friends and family is to play ""Shout about Movies"". We love it!!! Since they haven't come out with a new one recently, I purchased Party Games DVD. Boy were we dissapointed. The quality was embarrasing with the ease of technology, today. I agree with the previous reviewer. Please DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!"
1,Boooooo,I not only say this honestly but literally; my 5 year old child used Nero and made a more interactive DVD.
5,BEST TRIBUTE IN YEARS !!,"i have to agree with crimzap on this one!!! but like he said buy a copy and check it out for yourself., if you are a hendrix fan (like my self) than you have got to get this cd its one of the best tribute albums to be released in years! jimi would be proud of this one and to know that his music and legacy lives on!"
5,a great book from a great writer,"Stegner's writing is compelling and vivid. It is so vivid that I considered putting the book down and starting something else. The hideous, heart-wrenching event involving Bruce's horse was almost too much for me to handle. It made me truly dislike Elsa and detest the father. If there is any weakness in this book, it comes from the lack of appealing characters. Bruce is the only one I felt any compassion for, and my hope that he would survive the abuse and turmoil was my motivation for continuing the book. This is wonderful writing. However, I found it very depressing."
1,"Great book, but Kindle edition riddled with errors","I'm reading The Big Rock Candy Mountain for the first time. Great story. Unfortunately the Kindle edition is filled with punctuation and spelling errors, presumably from the digital conversion. I tried to figure out how to 'return' the book since I can easily check out a paper copy for free from the library, but apparently Amazon doesn't allow returns of ebooks. Or at least not in a way that's obvious to me. Thumbs down on Amazon's quality control, at least in this instance. And at $12.99 it should be much cleaner."
5,One of his best,"An American/Canadian saga, dark, bleak at times, but beautifully written, Stegner might be an acquired taste, but I am a huge fan."
5,Wallace Stegner,I loved this book as i do all of Wallace Stegners writing. He has a deft touch with words and seems to be able to layer suspense within seemingly everyday doings.
4,Third-favorite of Stegner's works,"Readers who are introduced to Wallace Stegner probably read his masteriece, ""Angle of Repose"" first, as I did. He was a genius of a novelist, and his work is highly acclaimed. So, liking one book more or less than others is just ideosynchratic. Big Rock Candy Mountain was broader in scope and focused on a family rather on a couple or couples. Like the great Western outdoors he writes about, sometimes the prose goes on and on, and I wished he would move the story along."
5,couldn't wait to come home to,"How did I get to be 47 and never read this wonderful book! Compelling story, 4 main characters that I cared about despite their flaws and weaknesses, wonderful descriptions of life in the west in the early 20th century. Stegner wrote this book when he was a young man; interesting to compare to his better known Angle of Repose which he wrote as an older man. This is a book I couldn't wait to come home to, curl up with, and become a part of the Mason family."
4,A great book for the sport diver and reef lover.,"A book well written and researched for the layman. The Enchanted Braid describes the addiction to the sea that many sport diving enthusiast experience. It provides a global perspective of the mysterious plight of our coral reefs. I read the book while in Bali, Indonesia. The well travelled author's feelings about the plight of the reefs is true to form from my perspective. The message is one we all should read and heed."
2,does it really works?,"I bought the book because it was in the bibliography of ""don't make me think "" by Krug. The book gives some interesting advices but my overall rating is ""poor"". It's creativity seen by a mass production engineer, it's like an art book written by a bank clerk.And most of all the writing style it's incredibly boring (you know those documents starting with ""list of the acronyms used in the document""?)And please amazon fix this bug with ""how do you rate this item?"" loosing it's value when you go back to the ""write your own review"" pressing the edit button. I know I know, it's not the apropriate place, but have you ever tried to go through the contact section of this website?"
2,... superior or just ...?,"The figures arms cannot be lowered, limiting the available poses to waving gestures. ..."
4,My First Disappointment in the LEGENDS Line.,I would have expected that one of MARVEL's most powerful characters would have meritted more from the line of MARVEL LEGENDS than to be put up of spare parts from the SERIES I release of IRON-MAN...or is that just fitting irony.
5,Why can't singers perform this way now??,"I also bought this CD to hear Montserrat Caballe sing the role at this early stage of her career and was pleasantly surprised by not only the quality of the recording, but the quality of the whole performance. I wouldn't say that Mario Zanasi is horrible, but he sounds like a tenor and a little wimpy for this role. Franca Mattiucci is an exciting Azucena and Richard Tucker is an intelligent Manrico. As a previous reviewer stated, Schippers does pace Leonora's first act cabaletta at breakneck speed, but she amazingly keeps up with it. Her ""D'amor sull'ali rosee"" in the last act is to die for... what control and beauty. If you're like me and are frustrated in finding an overall satisfying recording of this wonderful opera, give this a try. It's not the ""ultimate"" recording, but for the price, it's certainly a worthy addition to your collection. And... it begs the question, ""why can't we find a Leonora like this today??"""
4,Muy buena version historica.,"El sonido de esta funci√≥n en directo, grabada en 1966 en Florencia es bastante bueno, lo que ayuda a disfrutar de una versi√≥n que cuenta con los alicientes de una MONTSERRAT CABALLE en estado de gracia, que brinda una Leonora de antologia. A su lado, el nada despreciable Manrico de RICHARD TUCKER, con una interpretacion bastante memorable redondea una grabacion donde destaca tambien el noble Conte di Luna de MARIO ZANASI y la mas que suficiente Azucena de FRANCA MATIUCCI. Si sumamos al Ferrando de lujo de IVO VINCO y la direccion inspirada de THOMAS SCHIPPERS, con un coro y una orquesta que rinden al nivel deseable obtenemos un muy interesante Trovatore, digno de escuchar para cualquier aficcionado que conozca y ame la obra."
2,A big let down,"I bought this book for my research on my college thesis, which is about how the Faith-Based Initiative and Charitable Choice reflect a growing trend in government to privatize welfare services. I want my research to be fully informed by all the various differing voices in the debate over Charitable Choice, and thought that this book would yield thoughtful, intelligent analysis and discussion. I was sadly disappointed. This book is not meant to be a resource for any serious scholarly discussion, as I found it greatly oversimplified many of the topics it approached, and is written very much in a consumer-friendly fashion. If you are looking for a book that will lay out the basic positions of supporters of Charitable Choice and the Faith-Based Initiative, and a simple explanation of what Charitable Choice is, then this is the book for you. However, if you are looking for serious scholarly discussion, don't waste your money."
4,Excitement from the magazine section at the supermarket,This is a great documentary slash story. All of us who've browsed the muscle mags at the supermarket with embarrassed discretion when the grocery moms wheelled down the aisle now know we were not alone. Fabulously presented.
5,a simpler time,"Interesting and informative docu/drama of the pioneering male nude photographer and short film maker Bob Mizer, told by some of the actual models including Joe Dellasandro of Andy Warhol fame. Great acting but some shaky production values due to the budget limitations of the film makers. They audio commentary adds a lot too."
3,Just OK.,"An interesting film, respectful and with a touch of humour. Not a ""must see"" material but nothing I felt sorry after buying it."
5,dino live,This is the best Dean Martin cd I have ever heard. I have all of dean's funny shows and I think this one is the best. My parents are in their 70's and this cd brings back great memories for them. My mother laughs every time she plays it and she plays it alot!
5,feeling good,Just to be able to get such wonderful music and an artist that is no longer with us is fabulous. We just love listening to the CD.
3,You'll like it if you can live with the bads,"Pro:1. Gives great workout; 20 minute session on this with moderate to fast pace will give you an intense, sweating, calories burning exercise.2. Small, easy to store away.3. good value, relatively inexpensive.Con:1. You need something to support your hand positions for optimum workout posture; I use a chair with high back.2. The 2 shocks will get VERY hot (see the warning labels on the shocks); after an intense workout, I can even smell the scent of hot metal (not joking).3. Gets creaky and slightly noisy, but tolerable.---"
1,Shockingly Bad,I loved it the first 2 months i had it. With out notice the cable shredded. I called and emailed and nobody at the company got back with me. It seem that the inside of the wheel was rough and began tearing it.The customer service is bad and so was the product.
5,Well worth the price!,"I live in a tiny apartment, so this was perfect for my daily workout! It's so small and compact, I can use it everyday and then easily store it out of the way. And the workout? I can really feel the burn in my upper thighs. I usually work out 30 minutes a day while I'm listening to the radio. It's perfect for anyone who lives in a small apartment or dorm. And it's very well-built too. Like the other users have mentioned, it does tend to squeak a bit, but it wasn't enough to really annoy me, especially with the music playing."
2,tether broke,"Is it squeeky? Yes. But I didn't mind. What I DID mind was the fact that the tether which acts as a pully broke about a year into its use. I didn't use it vigorously, and I'm only 160 lbs. I'd say avoid."
4,Good item,At first it was hard to get used to the stepper. I started using the post of my bed to keep my balance and it worked much better. I like this product. It is small and easy to store. It gives me a good workout when I am unable to make it to the gym.
3,Electronic mini-stepper,"I like this product. Just like others have said, it does squeek, but I sprayed some WD-40 where the pully is and it has been quiet ever since. I watch TV and use it."
2,quick squeeker,It started squeeking after only a few days of use (about 10 min each) and also we couldn't get the digital counter to work.
4,Great price but a little hard to step...,"This is the first stepper I bought, and I don't know if they are all like this, but it's a little hard to step on, meaning I have to use all my might to get each step to sink down. But it's convenient and the price is great"
2,Overly biased!,"First, I received this book with almost 27% of pages unreadeable, seems to be a problem of printing. Hopefully, I managed to find the book in the Internet.Secondly, the book itself is simply way too biased. I don't want to extend myself about that, just to say the book depicts Chile as a bunch of ruthless sanguinaries, killers by nature that were so happy because the war season was open and the Peruvians ... were all ""gallants"" and they performed with ""gallantry"". I don't think so. But I understand this author and his passion for the Ynka Land where he spent some years of his life, an englishman who was a prolific writer with several other interesting books dealing with exploration.In any case, a much more balanced account of this war is given in the book ""The ten cents war""."
5,The package,In reference to the Dec 7th/2001 review by Michael Mccarthy:I to bought this when it was originally released and aside from the collected songs and book - which cannot be faulted - the package was as Michael points out beautifully done - it did in fact win a Grammy (for the packaging and the way it was put together - all hardbound etc)- I had intended to buy this box set for my Daughter - however after having read Michael's review I chose not to pay the high cost given the packaging has been downgraded..Like Michael I cannot understand why they would have done this given the cost remains basically the same. If your looking at purchasing I would read Michael's review and then look for the original...
3,so so,"A caixa me decepcionou um pouco, a parte gr√°fica e a embalagem esto aquem do que eu esperava e a parte musical propriamente dita tem coisas sublimes mas tamb√©m tem material de qualidade duvidosa."
2,Waste of my money,"I've been image streaming since November of 2003. I recently took an I.Q. test and compared the results to an I.Q. test I took prior to starting. My I.Q. score indicates that my intelligence has not increased at all.To anyone interested in buying ""The Einstein Factor"", I warn you that it is a gimmick. I have been image streaming for 15 minutes a day for the last 7 months and have not felt any increase in my mental capabilities.Also, Win Wenger states that your I.Q. will increase by twenty points after a few months...This can't be true because of the fact that a jump in I.Q. from 140-160 is much higher than a jump from 100-120."
5,Original and unique,"This book is amazing. I assure you, I was never a genius, but I did the exercises in this book and they helped me think more clearly, and I raised my grade point average from 2.1 to 3.4 the semester after I read it, and there's no doubt it was this book that made all the difference for me. Wenger's other book ""Discovering the Obvious"" is completely different, but also outstanding. Five Stars."
2,Save your money,"This book really does [stink]. I have done image streaming fora while now. I do it 30 minutes,twice a day and have gonethrough many a trigger and have seen NO IMAGES period.The only thing I do see is kaleidoscopic patterns of lightappear before me when I shut my eyes, and other wierd blobsof light patterns. But I didn't need Wenger to tell me this.He is getting two stars for the following reasons[1]showing me what I already have expereinced.[2]for being honest in stating that 30% of people who doimage streaming will fail !I am his waterloo !Despite this nasty review I will do image-streaming for a bitlonger-for a couple of weeks longer at max and if no improve-ment -[forget] this method."
1,"Messy, unsubstanciable claims","What a load of rubbish. I very much doubt the author is a true scientist, he sounds like a school teacher who took 15 years of night school to get his PhD. Cutting to the chase, he makes a series of boastful claims, fills the book with anecodotal evidence, presents not 1 iota of proper, verifiable evidence to suggest that image streaming can advance IQ by a single jot. If you want to hear a plethora of interesting and amusing facts, by all means buy it but I would rather spend my money on an encyclopedia and actually learn something for real. So basically another nugget of fool's gold (and I'm the greatest fool for buying it)."
1,apparently it is B.S,This book is poorly organized. The author makes large claims. The process of image streaming itself is ambiguous. I tried the image streaming as it said and got no gains. What a waste of time and money! The author's claims are unfounded. The Reinert studies which are supposed to measure gains in I.Q are hillarious.It is not based on a standard I.Q test but some rough shod unsubstantiated test. The author is cockey about his claims which makes him dangerous. Save your money!
5,Outstanding!,This is among the best methods I have ever used for becoming a genius. . .it has had a positive impact on my scientific career!!!
5,Best Book!,"This is the best book in the field of creativity and accelerated learning!!! After only 15 minutes, I felt that my brain had a really good and hard workout."
5,a must read,"if you've ever been serious about bringing out the genius within, you must get this book! The approach is not only innovative but effective. The image streaming and borrowed genius techniques are excellent and deceptively simple. It doesn't take long before you begin to realize the effects of this book. I'm a student in university now and this book has had a tremendous effect on my learning...especially my perceptive abilities. I recommend this book to everyone, at any age."
5,the self improvement bible!!!,"I bought this book several years ago and I still refer back to it often, it has become a classic in my home and in my consulting business. I have Image Streamed regularly and have seen improvements in virtually every area of my life. Not to mention it is FUN and relaxing! And the chapter on techniques for children alone is worth the money.I highly recommend this book to anyone who is looking to enhance their creativity and access the dormant areas of their mind."
4,A great combo,"I don't have to say anything about the methods listed on this book. They really are helpful. Besides that, it also sparked my interest in Quantum Cosmology(there's a page on Superstring theory, really interesting), philosophy (Plato's Cave and the Socratic Method)etc. If you may be a bit disbelieving about the methods outlined, at least buy it for its informative quality(I mean, at least it tells you new things)"
2,Great title,"The author tried some experiments within a process caled image-streaming. A dubious measure of IQ both before and after indicated that an increase of 1 IQ point per hour was yours for the taking if you applied the technique.I guess the authors are pretty confident that most of the potential audience are pretty thick since average to 'gifted' is just 30 hours away and genius levels of IQ are just 50 hours of this technique away. Sounds about right, yes?Frankly there's nothing wrong with image-streaming - it's an interesting technique and you're likely to enjoy a number of the exercises in the book. BUT - they aren't going to make you as smart as Einstein nor are the purported levels of IQ gain likely to occur. If it really happened as suggested don't you think you would have heard about it somewhere other than on the back cover of this book?Please Mr Wenger, prove me wrong and reproduce the results in controlled tests. With calibrated tests? No? Says a lot really."
1,Not all that,"I read this paperback years ago and I enjoyed it. But there's nothing about it that warrants even the $28 price tag on the used copies, let alone $150+ on the new ones. Save your money; this is highway robbery."
2,Author is not a true scientist,"Being quite motivated to take my intelligence to the next level, I bought this book with high hopes. What I found was that the author has never proven any of his techniques and leaves the reader with a messy set of guidelines from which to follow. The good reviews coming before this are probably just a consequence of people following each other's lead. No one has yet provided IQ scores( which is the result of image streaming - the main technique ). Don't buy this book if you have hopes of increasing your intelligence"
3,Decent.,"I have always been interested in intelligence. I have always been a wiz in school, I never study anything I guess I just have a good memory. I always wondered why I was this way and why others weren't. I don't remember doing anything special as a kid besides playing an instrument, which the author touches upon. However I see no evidence that his methods work, no studies except one done by a Physics professor. There's really nothing scientific about what he's done. I think that maybe your intelligence can be improved slightly, but not in the monumental proportions that this guy is talking about.The book appeals to most of the population who have trouble in school and who are looking for a quick fix. I seriously doubt that Image Streaming does anything but increase visualization. If Dr. Wenger can provide adequate evidence that his method works then great. However until then I will remain skeptical about his work."
1,Pseudociencia,"Este libro y el sitio mantenido por Win Wenger son un claro ejemplo de la pseudociencia al estilo de la Dian√©tica y la Cientolog√≠a. Tengan cuidado con otro ejemplo de pseudo ciencia: Tony Buz√°n y sus mapas mentales. Todos estos ejemplos tiene como com√∫n denominador prometer hacerlo m√°s inteligente de lo que es. Creanme, sean inteligentes y no compren dichos libros. Se har√°n un gran favor. Mejor visiten sitios como el de James Randi quien se dedica a desenmascarar a charlatanes y pseudo cientificos como Wanger, Buzan, Hubbard, Uri Geller y otros."
4,Not bad,"The technique of ""Image Streaming"" has shown promising results in certain cases. Much of the hype and propoganda, however, has been that the process can create a 20 point gain in IQ, relying on the 1989 study by Dr. Charle P. Reinert, the ""Reinert Study"". The following link will take you to the abstract -http://www.themindaccelerator.com/research/rp2.htmThe study, however, does not detail a 20 point gain in IQ through image streaming, unless I am reading the abstract wrong. It discusses a much lower gain, less than half the advertised 20 point gain in certain circumstances. As for the validity of the test, not enough detail is noted in the abstract for one to objectively judge for themselves. Unfortunately, this discrepnancy has resulted in a diminished outlook on this technique to several persons. It is unfortunate, because the technique is worth learning and can be very beneficial when combined with other cognitive techniques, such as the Sedona Method."
3,"Good book, bad reading","Between the two - book or recording, please choose the book! The materials are useful, provided you have both time and motivation to embark on a long course of self-development, with a lot of exercises, a lot of daily work.The problem with this recording is, however, that it is read not by a professional reader, but by Dr. Wenger himself. He probably is a smart man, but not smart enough to understand that his voice is quite senile, lacks energy, his diction is blurred, with no persuasiveness, no impact on listener, very boring and totally non-convincing. I have no problems when youthful Tony Robbins reads his own materials recorded on tapes and CDs with his unmatched Passion, but I do have a problem with something as life-less and monotone, as the recording of this otherwise excellent course. Four stars for the book, only 2 stars for the recording."
3,Not bad but not great,"Like most people who bought this album, I bought it for the ""Boyz in the Hood"" remake. When I first heard this alternative style remake of the gangsta rap song I could not stop laughing and I had to hear it again. Even when you get past the comedic value it's still a very good song (and DH's version is much better than NWA's). So I figured a band that shows this much talent has to be to worth buying. Well, not quite. The rest of the rock/alternative album is ok but nothing new or special and it doesn't live up to the band's potential. You're probably better off saving your money, which I would have done if Amazon had some preview tracks for this CD (serves them right that I bought it from Best Buy). But anyway, these guys do know how to play so hopefully their next album will be better and hopefully Amazon will let us know if it is."
2,it's sad when a remake is the only great song,"I was about to buy ""Superfast"" by Dynamite Hack, after hearing ""Boyz in the Hood,"" and ""Dear Kate."" ""Boyz in the Hood"" became my favorite song by listen # 2. I heard ""Dear Kate,"" and thought it had a cool catchy tune. I assumed that the rest of the album would be similar, but I was wrong. Luckily, before i went out to by it, I listened to my friends' copy. The only really good song was ""Boyz in the Hood."" The only other song that even came close to matching Boyz N the Hood's greatness was ""Blue Sky."""
1,A waste of the earth's resources...,"After my brother was into this group because of ""Boyz In The Hood,"" I played him the REAL ""Boyz In The Hood"" and he hated it. When a generation of teeny-boppers lose the meaning and value of the original, replacing it with some honky-pseudo-country remake, it's sad. I'm not black, nor am I trying to be self-righteous, but I think that's sad. What could be an occasional concert gimmick is stretched beyond its limit and succeeds in warping the minds of a generation of young listeners. What was ""alternative"" is now mainstream, and I think we need to realise this. Hey kids, go buy yourselves some NWA and learn about injustice and growing up without dot-com money to spend on junk like this."
3,* They did not write Boyz-N-The-Hood! *,"Just to let all you teeny boppers know, Dynamite Hack did NOT write ""Boyz-N-The-Hood""! It's an old Eazy-E song and was one of the greatest rap songs of all time!"
4,a great cd,this is one of the best cd's i have ever bought. boys in the hood is a great song and so are the rest of the songs on this cd.
5,Excellent recipes for gifts,I love to bake cookies and have won blue ribbons at the Del Mar Fair here in San Diego. There are many new recipes in this book to try and new ideas for Christmas gifts. I make cookie jars and fill them for gifts. The pictures are great and the recipes easy to follow. Perhaps with all these new recipes I will find a good entry for the fair. I look forward to trying many of the recipes.
5,Buying this for a pastry chef,I purchased this book years ago at a book sale for charity. I bought it for the cookie recipes and was surprised to find all the Libby's pumpkin recipes. Whenever I bake for the holiday I get rave reviews form the family. I am now purchasing the book for my sister-in-law who is a pasty chef. She loves everything I have made form this book. She recently asked me to get her a copy of the book if I ever see it again. Coming from her that means a lot because of how particular she is and how many cook books she already owns.
5,Cokking Cookies with the best.,This is a great book for anyone who loves to bake like me or wants to get into baking. The majority of the recipes are easy to follow and understand and there are a lot of great and different type of treats for your friends and family to enjoy after you have baked up all these different goodies for them to enjoy. This is truly a quality baking book that any one can master and you are sure to find at least more thing you and your love ones will enjoy eating for years to come. I know I have.
2,"Nice collection, but too much pumpkin!","There's nothing actually wrong with the cookie recipes in the book. However, they're hardly what I'd consider the all-time greatest cookie recipes ever, anywhere. The book is a big promotional piece for Nestle products -- I suppose that explains the presence of more pumpkin recipes than anyone could ever use. Also, the brandy snap recipe is line-for-line identical to the one in _The Joy of Cooking_, so I wonder where else some of the recipes originally came from. I didn't buy this for myself, and I'm glad that I didn't -- I have better things to spend my money on."
1,Bad Remake,"This song when sung by Berlin was wondeful and not vocally overdone. Jessica Simpson sounds as if she is ripping her vocal chords out to hit some of the notes towards the end of the song. None of the remixed are particularly exciting and they all drag on without end. Unfortunetly, it seems as if this entire cd was rushed and hurried along; I would save my $$!"
4,Buddy's Tribute to the Count,"For the most part, this is and an ensemble work. I used to play this in college and my roommate Wolfie would say it sounded like Jetson's music. He was of course referring to the cartoon when on the odd occasion, George would play drums with his band. The are is a couple of extended drum solos, but, for the most part Buddy plays to drive the band. The horns come out of nowhere to further drive the music beyond the drumming. Great stuff. The stuff swings, that's for sure. I disagree with the other review staying the band should have played looser. When you've got Buddy driving you to the next level, you have to stay tight for cohesive presentation. I admit, this wasn't Basie's style, it was loose and moving. But these arrangements and the songs selected were supposed to be the work of a tight band following the explosive drumming of a master."
4,14th century meanings of the stones,"a charming book to wander about in. but for one item, a 14th century ballad of the meanings of the stones ,each months birth stone and the reason for it. Worth the price for any one who loves the history of gemstones for these two pages alone."
4,This doll can't get no respect!,"This doll looks like Rodney and has 11 Minutes of Rodneys actual act. I have no trouble hearing what he says. There's some people talking in the background, but you get that at a live show.He tugs at his tie and his other arm is poseable to any direction you want. A must have for any True Rodney fan."
1,Rodney Dangerfield animated toy wasn't so animated,"I liked the concept, but his mouth didn't move like it was supposed to, and his arms didn't move too much either. The speaker wasn't a very good one, so you had to listen very hard, and still couldn't get everything he was saying. I think he was a cheap doll and shouldn't have been priced cheaper."
3,A classic text,"While the book does fully discuss the ""basic forms of prophetic speech"" in detail, it is not a text that can be taken lightly. Much of the information seems a bit convoluted at times and the author seems to be repetitious and occasionally self contradictory. This is a text for serious study of prophetic works contained within the OT and is a classic reference for those willing to muddle through minutia."
3,No figures,"All of the figures are omitted in HTML format. As such, I found the electronic article of limited use."
1,A disappointed basque from Oneonta,Hirigoyen should have based his book on the french basque recepies and left the spanish basque recepies to the ones who know better. I have not seen a single spanish basque dish in the book that is authentic! Hirigoyen should know that we never cook with butter and white pepper.
3,"Beautfiul Book, Unusual Recipes, Needs an Editor","This book is full of gorgeous pictures and inviting, unusual recipes. Most of the recipes are relatively simple, although some hard-to-find ingredients are used. Its a great book; it could have used some more careful editing. Some of the directions seem puzzling or incomplete. A good book for an experienced cook, but probably a poor choice for a novice."
2,Low Budget All the Way,"I wanted to see a good old-fashioned western with Calvary v. Indians, but I apparently didn't have a high enough standard for the adjective good. This movie is about as low budget as they come. The battle scenes were almost comical. A member of the beleaguered army fort would observe with great fear, ""The Indians are forming to attack!"" Cut camera to the Indian charge and you witness a whole hoard of all of 12 to 15 Indians. Heck, half the time the Calvary outnumbered the Indians AND they were armed with repeating riffles sitting behind stockade walls. What were the Indians going to do, huff and puff and blow the fort down? Just when you think you had seen it all, the movie ends with the Indians simply letting the soldiers go because, ""They have fought the good fight and shown bravery."" Perhaps I should have sought a very good fairy tale. This movie certainly would have filled that need very nicely."
4,Bring your earplugs when buring DVDs on this thing,"Let me first say that this DVD writer does an excellent job at what it's supposed to do...write DVDs. I have stored all my digital pictures on DVDs and play them as a slideshow on my HD TV...my kids love it.Yes, the unit is bulky, but I have more than enough space on my computer desk for it. I like the design of the writer...has like a mirror effect on the front of the writer.My only complaint is how noisy it is. I used to think my PC mad a lot of noise...well this writer takes the cake. It takes a few minutes to get used to the loud fan...and then you get used to it. You'll really get a feel for how loud the fan is when you turn the writer off.All in all, I am very happy with it. It does the job that I need it to do...and does it very well. Speed wise, I would say it's about average. If you don't burn too many things (like myself), then no worries on purchasing this."
2,Dropped it and it broke,"I bought the 810 model, which is similar. Worked generally fine, but because of its shape, easy to drop or fall over. I put it on top of my desktop, and accidentally it fell on the wooden floor, and since then, it has not turned on. Too fragile."
1,Never worked,Very noisy. Poor build quality. Door misaligned. Despite spending days with customer service and buying more software at their suggestion burner would never work. Tried it on three different Mac computers with no luck. Still waiting on Sony to fix it or replace it.
2,too slow a burn on DVD-R,"I purchased this unit because it advertised 16x burn on DVD-Rs. I used 4 different brands of DVD-Rs listed on the website for this unit. None of them recorded faster than 2x. I could not get it to even record a DVD+R faster than 2x. I returned the unit after 3 days of trying different software configurations. Nothing I tried increased the burn rate faster than 2x.The only reason it deserves a ""2 stars"" is because it plays back very well and did produce a good recorded DVD-R, it just takes ""half a lifetime"" to complete a burn."
1,Unhappy,"I never got this drive to go faster than 2x. I finally returned it, after spending a day getting no help from Sony tech support. They had no clue what the problem was, and their final answer was to tell me to go back to the store and buy some Sony DVD-Rs. I returned the drive and got a HP dvd840e instead. It works great with the same computer and DVD-Rs. Plus it has Lightscribe which is a nice bonus.Avoid this drive..."
5,"Very good, but not as dark as I remember","I thought I remembered Kenya Kilimanjaro being very dark but like another reviewer said, this is not really that dark. It is very good, for a medium roast. I'm not sure if they changed the recipe in the last few years or if my tastes have changed that much.Anyway, this roast is very good, adds a nice base if you like creamer in your coffee, but not a very DARK bitter blend for those who prefer that."
1,Weak cofee,"I was very disappointed in this coffee from Van Houtte. It was weak, when it claimed to be bold. I had to add instant coffee to render it drinkable."
5,Rich and Full Bodied,"Found this to make a rich, strong cup of morning coffee! This is one of my favorites along with Newmans."
2,"I ""All-In-Wonder"" What is wrong with the ATI software!!!","The card is good as a standard video card, for games, windows, etc. The problem is the ATI software that is provided and is required to run the TV and TV scheduler (record TV shows). The software is very buggy, and has not worked on my pc yet. The support from ATI is poor, and after 3 days has amounted to not much more than suggestions to download the newer software and reinstall, which has no helped. After each re-install a new crop of crashes comes up, and the scheduler NEVER works. Save your money, buy a non ""All-In-Wonder"""
1,Don't do it !!,"The first time I tried this, it damaged the camera's lens cover mechanism. The little hooks that hold it to the lense poke into the area where the covers exit the mechanism, causing it to stop working. Do not buy or use this product!!!"
3,A little disappointed,"The item was as described, however, I was disappointed that I had to cut-off about an 1/8"" at the end of each 12 iches to make a continuous ruler that was accurate. Still, it was a decision I made because this was cheaper than some of the alternatives and I didn't want to spend much on my project."
3,Numbering,I like this tape but the numbering for my project needs to run the other way. From bottom to top vertically so it can be read by a child. Is there something like this available or will I have to make my own. Hoping you can help. Nancyfromaus
4,Old times sake,Great music that reminds me of bluffing my way into Los Vegas lounges when I was under 21 just to hear Louie and Keely.
2,Disappointed,I'm a big Louis Prima fan but I was very disappointed with this cd. It didn't capture the excitement of a Louis Prima show.
2,shipped twice without inspection,"Interesting little book. I'm uncertain whether anyone could learn anything from a book about dance, but used as an aid or reference to enhance live instruction, it might be useful... perhaps. Unfortunately, this fifty page book, which saves it's suggested ballroom routine for pages 31 and following, is printed pages 1 through 30 - the last 20 pages being left blank.I returned one copy explaining how it was defective only to receive another that was exactly the same way. I suspect that all the remaining copies have the same defect, and we could go on and on like this for a very long time."
4,Beats the sophmore jinx,"This second full-length disc from the So Cal band is a solid, solid album. Their first album (Poised to Break) was dismissed by some as being too derivative, but that claim doesn't hold on this offering, as Edward Reyes and the boys have put together an album with satisfying textures, an edgy almost-live sound, and lyrics that don't play the proverbial cards too close to the chest. This is a mature album from a maturing band."
3,Not quite as catchy as the first one...,"Unfortunately, as of this writing, it appears that, after five years, Sunday's Best are dead and gone. I remember the day I unwrapped the promo of their first EP, Where Are You Now, on the living room floor of my college apartment - it doesn't seem like over five years ago. This LP came out in mid-2002, to too little acclaim. They had recently gone through a lineup change, adding a new bassist, and prior to the recording, drummer Tom Ackerman went through some tough drug/marital issues. As usual, it sounds like they've done a bargain-basement job with a really *good* producer - seven to ten days, in and out.Some of the songs are really there ""Beethoven St."" and ""Salt Mines of Santa Monica,"" and overall, the lyrics are better than on the first LP, but a few, like ""The Try"" don't make the crucial timing of their placement (first) on the LP, after repeated listens."
4,The Importance of Community Development,"Through statistical and qualitative analysis, this book illustrates the importance of community-wide development as a key to the economic rejuvenation of the inner city. The analysis is comprehensive and provides an excellent resource for individuals and entities involved in community development."
2,Doesn't add much to the play experience,"My 2-1/2 year-old son received this for Christmas along with three of the plane characters and one of the hangars. The play mat is very cute, but it basically just acts as a storage area in our living room for the toys. He never uses it to actually play with the planes in terms of running them down the roadways, etc. It is durable enough, but I would say it's a waste of money.UPDATED: My son is now 4-1/2, and actually uses the play mat more now than he did before. He must have been too young to grasp the idea of it, but now he's using it like it's intended. I guess it was a good buy after all!"
3,Smaller than I had hoped for,I thought maybe this item would have been a bit larger other than that it was okay.
2,"Good idea, but not practical","We bought this so that the stroller could have shade from the front. It was hard to put on and keep stable, and the parts broke easily. Not worth it!"
1,Don't Waste your Money!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I bought this to shade my baby in her umbrella stroller while vacationing at the beach. The umbrella is SMALL and difficult to reposition. Definitely a waste of money. Better to invest in a more expensive umbrella stroller or lightweight stroller that comes with a sunshade.
3,nice but doesn't fit the graco stroller well,I like that you can shade your baby from the sun from the sides. But the grip for the umbrella is very small and doesn't fit the Graco stroller well at all.
1,PIECE O' JUNK,"If I could give this idiotic contraption 0 stars I would. There is no good way to attach it so it never adequately shields the baby. What's more, it topples over onto baby if you so much as breath on it, making it not only useless but dangerous."
5,A compelling adventure story for women!,"The title suggests a light chick-lit book, but this novel is way more than that. The Secret Lives of the Sushi Club is the story of four women whose deepest secrets make it into print, thanks to the betrayal of one they considered a friend. In the aftermath of instant celebrity and scandal, they take a rafting trip together down the Salmon River and discover even more secrets about each other. Great surprises I won't give away! This is a powerful story about the mistakes women often make when they're young and not so young, and the joys they share with each other. I loved the male characters too, especially Jina's boyfriend, Mike, who isn't the perfect man, but is so perfect for her you have to root for him. There's even an elk who thinks he's Elvis Presley! The description of the scenery along the Salmon River and the river rafting is wonderfully written. I can't wait to read more of Ms. Yorke's work."
1,So bad I didn't finish it,"The back cover sold me. Four friends, one of them betraying the others with a revealing novel. But that's not really what this is about. The dynamic of the friendship is lost somewhere. I kept waiting for it to get better and it just got worse. I decided to stop reading it about two-thirds through and I'm not the least bit curious about how it ended. I don't know about her other novels, if I see one at the library I'll give it a try, but I'm not spending my $$ on one."
1,"Unbelievable, bad and unbelievably bad","I can't believe all these positive reviews! It was readable, but hardly exciting, profound or wondrous. In fact, parts of it were laughable. An elk that thinks he's Elvis? Give me a break! A man who may be ""part fish?"" Yeah, right.Then there's the ambiguity surrounding the character Jina. Why does she spell her name like that? Is it just exoticised Italian, or something more? I happen to know that Ji-na can be a Korean women's name, and there are hints that she might be Asian, but this needs to be made clear long, long before the book ever goes to print. And don't even get me started on the requisite Arab bad guy.A nice ""pitch"" novel, full of elements designed to appeal to readers. In terms of achieving something as a novel, though, it's a mess."
3,Pieces don't map to countries,"The pieces in the puzzles are not the shapes of the countries, they are just regular jigsaw pieces. I don't think this is as good for learning."
5,The songlist is from another CD,"I have this CD. IT is wonderful. But the songs titles listed on this page are not from this CD. My CD has the same cover, the same title. My CD says ""verve 314-517-956-2"" at the upper left corner on the cover. I want to buy it again because my CD has too many scratches. I bought it more than 10 yrs ago. I have my copy in my hand right now, the songs are all different from what is being displayed in the product description. Maybe the Amazon employees can correct this mistake."
3,more jazz and less jive,"A bit disappointing compared to Israel Lopez's recent recordings. Instead of surrounding ""Cachao"" with authentic Cuban musicians this recording, and its sequal-volume 2- is jazz oriented to a piano trio and altho the music is not poorly performed, it never reaches the red hot ""ritmos caliente"" beat nor feature any guitar or horn accompaniments that blow the music up into the Sun."
5,Excellent read!,One of my all time favorites. Good humor as science takes on magic. Like Gullivers Travels many parallels to our own history.
4,The Flying Sorcerers,As the title indicates - expect many puns and sci-fi references in this book. Quite enjoyable as a bit of light reading to while away a bit of time.
1,The Flying Sorcerers,"I am a Larry Niven fan, and have gone out of my way to track down out-of-print copies of his older books. When I saw this title, I was looking forward to another fine book in Niven's style.This isn't one. Niven's style is almost not present in the book. When I received the invite to review the book, I had to think hard about what the book was...it left that little of an impression on my memory.Normally I keep books and re-read them. I traded this one in."
5,"Fun, Fun, & More Fun",I read this book about 15 years ago and found it nothing but fun. Niven plays with the reader as well as the characters in the book. I have just found this book (out of stock) and await shipment so that I can visit this world again. I gave my first copy away and regret it. Not real science fiction but just loads of fun.
4,Shakespearean,"A very raw movie on the powerful role in people's lives of emotional dependencies on others, on how those dependencies develop and on how these higher in a relationship hierarchy exploit the dependencies for manipulation. The drama of the dependencies is underscored with sex and murder. The movie brings to mind Shakespearean plays such as Hamlet or better Titus Andronicus (no, not in the Julie Taymor edition). I actually ran across this movie in France."
1,Ahhem...,"TheHurtProcess - Drive By MonolougeThis band sounds like the Europeanversion of Boy Sets Fire, and that is not a good thing.I can't think of an album that false advertises morethan this one. For one thing, Derek Hess designed thealbum artwork... I am used to associating his ""brand"" withdecent material. I must say, they had to have payed him a lot.The music is so bitter and bland, and never goes anywhere.Where are the dynamics? On the cover is says ""For fans ofThursday, FATA, Taking Back Sunday"" and I can see wherethis album is in the same vein, but I would be very offended tosee my band compared to this one. (2.5/10)"
1,yuck,"Why must I even start, why must I even tell you guys that this sucks. FATA is not a band you should mesure anything to, becuase FATA is a trendy band that sucks. This is also a trendy band that sucks. THANKS A LOT VICTORY! Why did Victory sell out, they have been selling these hard core boy bands by the dozen. How could a label that has bands such as Snapcase, Grade and Integrity go and sell out and sell crappy music. Be careful, if you see a new Victory band's cd don't buy it. Chances are the next cd Victory puts out will suck and will be ""screamo"" crap that has been destroying the scene. Don't listen to fake, glam ass hard-core."
5,Easy Games,"This book for parents or teachers of younger grades is filled with great ideas for games with sections on ""Paper and Pencil Games"", ""Games to Improve Basic Skills"", ""Easy-to-Make Contests"", and ""Easy Indoor-Outdoor Games""."
3,Good for short time use,Don't try to use it for more than five minutes. The paper rips up like tissue. It use to be stronger. Mabe a cut back on cloth and now more paper.
5,Fantastic,Ella Fitzgerald Has One Of The Richest Voices ever To Hit The Human Ear.This is a Grand Overview of Her Great Voice.These Songs are Quality with A Capitol Q.She Shines all the Way Here.She was a True Legend she Broke Down So Many Doors.She had Her Own Style&Great Range.These Songs are Musical Treasures.
1,Switch a Ball,"I've bought this product to save me the time and money and I ended up losing money.In the first few months the ball was changing fine and everything is good. Now it's rusted and the 2-5/16 well not come out. So I'm stuck with 1 ball, just like a normall hitch. I really took good care with it and I had a bag for it. I use to clean it everytime it rained on me while towing or if it got dirty. That still didn't help."
5,Easy on off!,Perfect for those who needs to change ball size often. Takes up a lot less space than having a ball mount for each size.
5,Great Product Great Company,Would Reccomend to anyone looking for a nice switch ball set. Very Heavy duty set. Balls lock securly in place.
2,doesn't work in the cold,"So I've been using the curt switch ball with my f150 for the past month or so. I regularly tow a few different trailers and need to switch between the 2"" and 2 5/16"" ball. I got this so I wouldn't have to carry 2 different ball mounts around in my truck, and it fulfilled that purpose. Heres a big problem I've run into though. When it gets cold, due to thermal contraction or something, it becomes really difficult if not impossible to swap the balls out. At first I thought it was rust forming either on the stem or the balls, but I tried the 1 7/8"" ball which I have never used and it wouldn't go on either. I left it in my house overnight and now I can slide all of the balls on and off no problem. Haven't found a good solution to this yet. Thinking about trying the reese switch ball system to see if that works better"
3,Christmas Stuff,I have a lot of Steeleye CDs and before that many of their records so I am a bit of a fan.I was however disappointed with this one. Altogether too Christmassy and 'nice'. I like the harder-edged albums.
5,Great deal for your money!,"If you love Sandra Boynton books and want to save some money - get the box! My little girl loves all her books and I know them by heart now, too!"
5,Wonderful Boynton,"I bought this as a gift for young nephew. My daughter, now almost 3, has and enjoys Boynton. This is a great collection; we especially love ""Barnyard Dance."""
5,Perfect gift for children!!!,"These books are silly and fun, good for young children. I sent them to a friend's 2-year-old who is completely enchanted with Boynton - as well as his parents - and me too!"
2,Not one of Boyton's best,"My son did not show any interest in these books. Books are ok not very creative and rhyming as the ""The going to bed book""."
5,Barnyard is Best Boynton Book!,"We (my one year old) daughter and I love the Barnyard Dance! She actually started liking the book when she was about 9 months. I borrowed it from the public library, thought it was the best Boynton book ever and asked for it for Christmas. The number two choice, in my opinion is ""One, Two, Three."""
5,We read this book every night,I remember this artist from when I was a child. So glad she's doing books. Her illustrations are still charming and this story in particular is quite fun. I recommend it as a board book.
4,Boynton books,"Our family loves the Sandra Boynton books. The stories are short, the pictures catch childrens attention, and the stories are funny. Perfect!"
5,A great set of Boynton books!,"Our daughter is now 20 months old and she's been 'reading' Boynton books since she was a baby. We love the books, they have great artwork, memorable recurring characters, and age-appropriate (but not heavy-handed) themes. The books in this set complement the rest of our Boynton collection, and our daughter loves them as much as the rest. The rhymes in this set are a bit more sing-song then in our other Boynton book, but in a good way.We can't recommend all of the books by Sandra Boynton more highly for parents...and their kids!"
5,The Best!,"Just received the set few days ago, I have been reading them to my 9-month old, I think we both really enjoy the books. They are fun, easy to read, and they are full of cute colorful pictures. Very good board books. This set is the best among all of Sandra Boynton's board book sets.Follow up 09/2008: Now my baby is 2, we are still reading this set several times a week before bed. This is THE best Boynton set, you will have a lot of fun reading it to or with your child."
3,Nothing Special,"I felt that this film had potential to really deliver, but it fell short. The musical numbers were entertaining, but again, nothing special. The main story line was nice enough, but the sub-plots left a lot to be desired and some questions."
1,The Lively Art of Writing is anything but...,"Whether it is developing a thesis or hooking paragraphs, the Lively Art of Writing is a waste of time and energy. It teaches absolutely nothing and only gives a very tight form rather than allowing students to develop their own style. Used in English classes for God knows how long, it gets worse with age. About the only thing this book has going for it is that it's so fun to make fun of-- the dumb analogies and Lucille V. Payne's obsession with drag-racing, especially, have kept my English class highly amused."
1,Horrible,Can't stand it. The author is very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very BORING!
5,A Timeless Aid for Any Writer,"This book has helped me tremendously, not only as a writer but as a teacher of writing, as well. I often recommend this book to students who want to improve their writing style; it is easy to read and practices the art that it preaches. I find it much more useful than most of the handbooks that appear on composition course syllabi, and I even prefer it to that classic text by Strunk and White, The Elements of Style. The chapter on Passive Voice is especially good. I think that this book ought to have a place in every writer's library!"
4,Packed with information.,I purchased this book to help my teen in writing essays. The books is packed with information but some readers might find it difficult to understand if they are only used to reading modern English. Meaning that I f they have a hard time reading classics they might have a hard time understanding the writer. The book has many useful points and would encourage your child to read this books. It will help them improve there essay skills.
5,Essential reading for high school students,"I was subjected to this years ago in school. Reading it was horrible and dry, and the exercises made us want to rip our hair out. It was all worth it.Effective, strong writing is a timeless art that hasn't changed. If your kids are, like, you know, totally can't be bothered to write decent sentences and all that, they WILL benefit from this book. It has advice for even the strongest writers, little tricks that can make a meaningful difference in AP English and history tests, college entrance essays, college papers, and later in life, business letters/memos."
4,It's pretty good,This is a pretty good book. It's not the best. It does tell the student a lot of the typical mistakes. The book tells you what NOT to do but not what to do. This book is very very dated. The stories and examples should be updated for the past 40 years. I use strictly as a reminder of all the bad habits I should stay away from
2,"Reasonable idea, poor execution","I am a Junior high school student in the International Baccalaureate Program and i must say, i have been praised by many teachers for my writing abilities. Yet, this book, assigned in our Rhetoric class, is a juvenile attempt to teach the art of writing. The LAW merely teaches subjects that are, to many, common sense, such as the avoidance of passive voice, but any valid points made by the book are nearly invisible in the horrible examples, such as drag racing or teen-agers. (yes that's how old the book is. It was written when ""teenager"" was not its own word.) Ultimately, the book teaches a style of writing that does not nurture the natural abilities of a writer, but dumbs them down. If i were to write a paper based on Mrs. Paine's guidelines in a college course, my professor would certainly look at me, as if i were a child, and ask if i wanted a lollipop, for it would definitely match the maturity of Mrs. Paine's writing rubric."
4,"Maybe not the ultimate writing manual, but highly useful.","Having tried to teach style to students who have no clear concept of what an essay actually is, or how it's supposed to be organized, I've found this book to be a godsend. Dated or not, it gets its point across to students. The chapter on structure is particularly helpful."
5,Notice: the Bad Reviews are Poorly Written!,"The poorly written negative reviews ON A BOOK ABOUT WRITING indicate the quality of Vaughan Payne's book. THE LIVELY ART OF WRITING is invaluable! Not only does it help beginning writers, it is perfect for recent immigrants who feel ""lost"" when it comes to writing. It is especially helpful to those from Asia who have to write in our ""Western"" syle. I have successfuly used the book when teaching English at the secondary level AND the college level."
2,beware seam issues,"I like these shorts for the fit and feel...very light, easy wash easy wear...pockets are excellent...BUT...2 issues...beware they run small..second ..and more importantly 2 out of three pairs are un-stitching below the pocket reinforcement...after only one wash!!!..love Columbia...but not in this case...thank you amazon for the free return and credit..."
2,Velcro closures limit range of sizes,"The Velcro closure system isn't so great. There isn't a button, it uses Velcro instead. And the belt system is also Velcro and the range for the belt is limited because the connecting piece on the shorts isn't very long. The result is that while the Large is a little too tight for me, the XL is too big and can't be cinched tighter."
4,Nice product,"I bought these shorts for my son who is 18. They are a nice fit, elastic waist in the back, and roomy in the legs. They are perfect around the water because they dry very quickly. Would reccommend them for any age group."
2,broke twice,"Simple. It just is a cheap brittle aluminum. It snapped at the worst of times it could have and was unrepairable. Oh, and it snapped on a lake, not river. Proves it quality"
2,limp spaghetti claws,"The claws are bent away from the hand in the package, leaving you to try and straighten them out.They look like wet noodles. I found the blue right shoulder piece was detached upon opening the package. The legs have a limited range of motion and the figure is difficult to balance without the base."
2,No interest in the child's value,"I'm not interested at all in playing with toys. I've just been a huge fan of Wolverine for the last 12 years and this is the sharpest, most evil looking Wolverine mini statue I've ever come across. My respect to toy biz, this is something i'd expect from Todd Mcfarlane's toy sculptoring, cuz he makes twisted looking figurines."
1,It just doesn't work well,"Like the other reviewers, I just couldn't find a way to use this ""grabber"" that didn't cause problems that don't happen with other silicone grabbers. I thought Kitchen Aid would have a better product but they don't. Don't assume as I did that all Kitchen Aid products are quality. It is hard to use!"
4,Still incomplete,"There are thousands of colleges and universities in the US. These 320 are mostly the ones worth concentrating on. However, the list is still unfortunately incomplete. Where's Olin? Where's the University of Tulsa?Where's New Mexico Tech? Where's Colorado School of Mines? They list several others in the category lists and put an asterisk by them to indicate that they are NOT profiled... admitting their incompleteness. Don't make this your only guide or you might miss out."
2,"Great idea, badly done","I picked up this book because I thought it would be fun to read the bits of trivia. However, I wasn't very far along into it when I began finding factual errors -- errors in major categories that easily could have been corrected had the author or editor bothered to check. In Chapter One, for instance, the author claims that Hugh Griffith won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar in 1963 for ""Tom Jones""; in reality, Melvin Douglas won for ""Hud."" (Griffith won in 1959, for ""Ben-Hur."") Later, in a question regarding consecutive wins, the book omits Tom Hanks for his performances in ""Philadelphia"" (1993) and ""Forrest Gump"" (1994), although the book was published in 1999. Mistakes such as these can be found throughout the book."
3,"Good trivia quizzes, but not a reference book","This book has lots of fun information, but no useful way to look it up (like an index). So, if you want to know how many times a particular actor was nominated for a supporting role Oscar, you're out of luck."
1,Weak and error-ridden,"Needs a factcheker and a good shot of adrenaline before it can hold a candle to ""Inside Oscar,"" ""Oscar A to Z"" or ""The Encyclopedia of Movie Awards,"" all of which include trivia tidbits to greater (and more accurate) effect than Jones' poorly written mishmash.Skip it."
3,Mixed feelings,"The hammer is excellent and the price is right; however, the company sent the wrong hammer the first shipment. It had been listed as being in stock, and I needed it for a practical exam. So I am annoyed that I did not get it in time. OTOH, customer service was very nice. They let me keep the incorrect hammer at no charge. Unfortunately, I already have two regular reflex hammers, so... Mixed feelings."
3,Good value for the price,"The Stanley styrene marking gauge is a pretty good choice for a budget-conscious crafstman. When it comes to woodworking tools, heavier is often better as the weight gives you more control. This marking gauge weighs very little, which means you have to work harder to control it. Still, at about $8 retail you can't beat the price: a more robust gauge could easily cost you $50."
5,Love it!,Love the step by step instruction And pictures to follow. The experiments are just right for kids from 3 to 10 years of age.
4,My son loves it!,"He's bookmarked about half the pages already, so we'll have very busy weekends for a while. These experiments are inventive and practical."
5,Great fun in science!,"This is a big, colorful, fun science book. It is full of fun practical science demonstrations, many of which can be done with common household items. This book is at a level that young gradeschoolers can understand, and covers science topics as high as middle school levels. It covers eleven different areas from air and gases to motion and machines. I have done many of these projects with my children. I even used the ""Make a Rainbow"" demo from the Color section in my Sunday school class while teaching about Noah. This book is a great addition to a homeschool library."
4,Great for rainy days!,This book has some neat ideas and generally uses things you have in your home (especially if you have kids and all the stuff they accumulate).Really good for fun on a rainy day.
5,Manor House cancelled by the publisher!,"I love the Manor House series, I actually have the last two that I haven't read yet, so I will have something delightful to look forward to. I do this with the Daisy Dalyrimple, post WWI series as well.This is set during WWII in a village in England, where all must cope with boisterous Yanks, food rationing and the inevitable murderer in their midst. Lady Elizabeth and Major Monroe's attraction for one another is understated. The villagers, especially the tyrannical Rita Crumm and her womens group are always amusing. I will truly miss this series when the last two books are released."
3,Bum Lasers!,"I tried out the lasers when I opened the box but when I tried the gray laser it didn't do a thing. But the red laser worked fine for a little but then,it too stopped working. Now the game is completely useless. I don't roccomend this game."
4,alignment problems,"I have had alignment problems as well, noticable after only five reflections. From what I can tell, it stems from lax tolerances not with the laser, but with the reflective surfaces. The pyramid pieces in particular seem to be built with more angular variation than the others. I plan on calling the manufacturer to see if they have looked into tighter tolerances, or even to see if I could get a couple of replacement pyramids that are dead on. We'll see.Other than that minor frustration, the game is quite fun, and the alignment issues sort of add a little extra fun for us nerd types. I like to try to find which unit is misaligned. But I don't recommend letting your kids do that, because this laser is a class II and can be injurious if stared at.If you haven't noticed any alignment problems, go ahead and get the beam splitters, too. They add to the variety of the game.I feel really sorry for those with misaligned lasers; that would be a game breaker."
4,Great Game - Quality luck of the draw,"This is a favorite game to play with my 7 year old. Game is easy to learn yet is challenging at the same time. Great strategy game with the average length of play well within my son's attention span when playing best out of three.Game would rate 5 stars if it wasn't for the lack of quality control. We did not have alignment issues but every mirror was filthy and had to be cleaned before attempting to play. Some pieces had to have the rough edges smoothed to fit properly in the board squares.That said, I would purchase again and find the $40 price tag well worth it for such an innovative game."
2,Didn't work,The game didn't work when we opened it. The laser on one piece didn't work and it didn't help to change the battery.
1,CHEAP!,"I was really excited about getting this for my brother for Christmas, but when we opened the package, the lasers would not fire and we could never get them to work, which is the whole point of the game, so it's pretty much trash now."
4,Almost perfect.,"Incredibly fun game. Quick to learn, very hard to master. A rookie can easily beat a seasoned player due to one dumb move. Lots of fun and exciting chess-like game. But the lasers are very fragile. To fire them you push down on the heads of the sphinx. Unfortunately, if you push a little forward or backward as you push down, it can break the laser instantly - with very little pressure."
5,What a Great Game!,"I love strategy games, but never liked all the rules of chess. Khet has all the mind challenging strategy of chess, but is much easier to learn. Anyone can learn to play in minutes. Plus, you get to play with lasers!"
2,"Great Concept, Shotty Craftsmanship","Received Khet 2.0 in the mail today, all of the pieces have a indent in them where they were clearly broken off a chain of plastic molding. The mirrors have scratches and dents in them, and one of the lasers is really loose and does not work when pressed directly on, rather one must make a vividly hilarious maneuver with their thumb to get the laser going, inadvertently making the piece fall out of the triangle holster (on the board). Really disappointed, was looking forward to this line of sight game, however, China, which manufactures their product, is notorious for having quality consistency issues. Go figure, I paid what I got for (get it?)"
4,grandson loved it,"Requested by grandson. He played with it the first day, then not so much. I understand he continues to enjoy it."
4,Son loves the strategy,"This is a great game that really teaches the concept of thinking ahead. You have to balance between offensive and defensive moves. I only wish more than 2 players could play at once. Our family of four ends up playing little tournaments. If we could all play at once, even better. But, don't hesitate to get this one. It is well worth it!"
4,"Good game, with reservations.","An excellent challenging game, though rather tedious to set up. Not for kids (or grown-ups) with short attention spans."
5,Learning is fun!,Bought this for my 9yo who thinks board games are 'lame' due to lack of action. This game adds the excitement of shooting your opponent with a laser with the benefits of strategy with geometry! Highly recommend this game for everyone (my husband and I play against each other as well)! I plan to look for more games from Mensa. Who knew learning can be fun?!?
5,One of the all-time best jazz singers,"In the pantheon of jazz greats, I don't think it's an exaggeration to say that Nina Simone stands right up there alongside greats such as Billie Holliday. Her work even compares favorably with the instrumental giants like Coltrane or Davis; she's that good. This cd is my favorite from Simone's catalog, ""Love Me or Leave Me"" my favorite song. While less socially relevant than some of the other songs on this cd, it will leave YOU wanting to dance.However, ALL of the songs on this cd are great. Some make you want to boogie (yes, I said it), some make you angry, some make you want to cry, but regardless, it's hard not to be affected in some way by each of them. I'd also recommend Verve's ""Nina Sings Nina"" cd."
4,good,"I have the album already, so I didn't purchase it from Amazon and uploaded the songs myself. Some albums are ones I already have."
5,NINA SIMONE>>>DOES IT GET ANY BETTER?,To me she's the best singer on vinyl. If you are a jazz fan buy all of her offerings.
4,Decent Disney Mini-Series,"This 3 part mini-series is about students at the Lawrenceville School. As a former student there, i found the film most interesting. Unfortunately, it is a way more innocent version of my high school experience. It is still entertaining. The antics of Hickey, Doc McNooter and Tennessee Shad are quite fun while the Headmaster fights to keep it all together. An enjoyable 3 hours."
3,Not exciting,I found it quite unexciting and more like a romance of Mills & Boon rather than a suspense thriller. The characters were also a bit amateurish.
2,not for me,A reasonable price and a good beginning but what seemed to be a thriller turned into a slow love story with some mystery thrown in. Wasn't my cup of tea.
1,ZZZZZZZZ.......,I almost gave up in the midle of it. I didn't know where i found motivation to keep reading; probably because I didn't have another book in hands to try.Boring!
3,Chasing Darkness,"The author provides interesting details in the leading to the resolution of the mystery involved. It did provide a few tense moments; however, I did not find the details to answer the ""why"" to any degree of satisfaction. It was enjoyable reading, but not sure I'd label it a 'psychological' thriller."
4,Tea for one,"I bought this product, along with coffee and the Keurig coffee maker for my son and his wife. The tea was for her and she loves it; a fast and easy way to make tea for one without microwaved water or a kettle on the stove. It is a real hit and ""mom"" scored, at least this time!"
4,Bobby Darin: Live in Las Vegas,"As a fan of Bobby Darin, it was a treat to hear him perform in the old Las Vegas. The way entertainment should be in any venue. Because of the 100th Anniversary of Las Vegas, the album will become part of my collection celebrating this momentous event. Don't miss this one of a kind CD."
1,Is this book a joke?,"A book written on ""valuation of swaps and swaptions"" is obviously not for the lay man. I was extremely disappointed to go through this book, which seems to be fit for 5th graders. It's a shame that a supposed leading thinker like Fabozzi can write such a shallow, meaningless book. Mr. Fabozzi, please name one practitioner who cares to use this good-for-nothing book of yours. Perhaps a better title for the book would have been, ""Swaps and swaptions for dummies""."
5,Six Mornings On Sanibel,What a good read! Although we are familiar with Sanibel we know nothing about fishing--but we read every word and became involved with all the characters and situations. We look forward to any more of Mr. Sobczak's books.
5,six mornings on sanibel,"This book was given to me as a gift, not normally what I would have bought for myself. I would have really missed out on a excellent book. It really gets a person to thinking about life. Great reading."
3,"My Book "" Revue""","Did not like it much. Was not exactly what I had expected. I was wanting more on the place itself, but that's just my opinion. We actually did go on vacation to Sanibel and I did spend mornings on that beach. Skip the book, but do go visit the island !"
2,What the heck is this?,"The fine print on this title says that it's from Allegra Entertainment, copyright 2006. However, based on the washed-out cinematography, poor film quality, low-budget costumes, and portentious narration style, if this was made after 1970, I'll eat the disk. There are no credits or supplemental information of any kind on the disks, and there's no listing for it on the internet movie database, nor can I find anything about it with Google. Does anyone have any idea whether this used to be called something else, and when the heck it was made?"
3,HAVE TO WATCH A 2ND TIME TO APPRECIATE,"At 1st glance this ""film"" is quite boring and tedious to watch. But reflecting back on it some of it was PURE GENIUS. I probably would have liked it more were it shorter as the lack of dialogue lost my interest after about 30 minutes. If you are a die-hard Stop-motion animation person, then by all means rent, borrow, or buy this film. For the average person I do not think you will like this very much as it is not a very ""mainstream"" movie by any accounts. The pace seems very sloooow even for a stop- motion film. thereofore i give it the rating of merely ok."
1,Uhhhh? wtf?,"I'm sure it would have been 5 stars if I had of recieved it, it would have been 4 if the seller had responded to my email about never receiving it, but this is just awful, I was supposed to get this item on the 7th of January, nothing... and I got a thankyou email from Amazon... that's it.. ""Hey! Thanks for giving us your money!""Sorry! I'm pissed!"
5,strange,"This is an effective film in stop motion. The silent film has weird music and strange color. Hard to explain it, just have to see it. I felt like I was on mushrooms or something. Neat little film."
3,The same old stuff,"If you already have a lot of the old Johnny Cash albums this CD is not very interesting. It is just some more 'greatest hits' of which many have already been released on other 'Best of' CDs. I give it 3 stars for the 'first time on cd' songs like Jacob Green, Man in White, and Orleans Parish Prison and then the special liners notes."
3,"Buy ""The Essential Johnny Cash"" for real value...","This isn't a bad CD collection for the Cash enthusiast, but for someone just starting out, I'd recommend the Essential Johhny Cash. Yes, it's about $7 more, but you get 75 songs and an amazing booklet that includes tons of awesome photos, three incisive articles, and words from the Man in Black himself. By my count, Love God and Murder has about 12 songs from the Essential Johnny Cash, so if you're looking to add to your CD collection or you're intrigued by the liner notes, this ain't a bad purchase."
3,Not his best work,"ADF's great talent lies in creating strange new worlds populated by bizarre creatures. In this regard, Life Form doesn't disappoint. It sometimes reminded me a little too much of Midworld, but it kept me interested enough to finish the book. However, relationships are not the author's forte, and it shows particularly painfully in this story. Overall, the book suffers from a wobbly narrative that is either some sort of third-person limited (which hops from one narrator to another, sometimes within the same paragraph), or a poorly executed third-person omniscient. Too much ""tell"" and too little ""show"" is the result, which leaves the reader unengaged."
3,"Foster has witten some great books, this isn't one of them","Every so often Allan Foster turns an idea into a book that doesn't quite make it, It's a well crafted book and readable, but the plot isn't one of his best.A nice read but not up to Fosters usual high standard."
1,I will spare myself the last twenty pages.,"Nothing interesting happens throughout the book. There's almost no action going on except for some childish discussions between a bunch of scientists who stumble around on a foreign planet. And these ""scientists"" are really a poor example of human explorers of the unknown. They have as much imagination as the dirt under my shoes. Totally blind for the obvious. In other words, you would never want to meet any of the protagonsits of this story. This is what makes the story extremely improbable and even boring. You wouldn't want to read that book. Spare yourself the 311 pages and read something else instead."
5,Great little book,I already had developed a meditation practice before I read this book. It helped answer questions that would arise. I advise my students to read this book for developing a meditaion practice.
2,Drama-soaked impossibly complicated drivel,"OK... for years, White Wolf hints that the East is a big bad place full of big bad vampires... And then they publish Kindred of the East. It's an anticlimax that should never have happened; someone fell asleep at the switch. Between the over-numerous virtues, restrictive societal protocols, uberdisciplines that let a KoE crush an opponent, and an unbelieveably complex system of rules that makes playing next to impossible, this book is not worth the nearly $30 you have to pay for it. Skip Kindred of the East if you can; if not, don't say you weren't warned"
2,Overcompensation/-stimulation,"Nice ideas, well that's what's positive about it. But White Wolf has gone the wrong way with this one: The deadlier, the better is seldom true. The Kindred of the East are by far mightier than Western Vampires, Mages, Werewolves, Faeries and Wraithes. This might be okay if you stay in system, but forget to play them in crossovers. They'll kill everyone - fun first."
1,disappointed,I bought this for my little boy and was very disappointed with this engine. It couldn't pull the other cars and would get stuck at the bottom of the hill spinning its wheels. It was constantly falling off the track around sharp turns. You would be better off with the smaller engines. This is the first trouble I have had with the Brio and Thomas trains.
3,4 or 6 Wheel Drive Needed at this Pricepoint,"Not to be derivative, but Mr. Jensen's review highlights the key weakness(es) of this engine, price and number of drive wheels. It REALLY DOES need 4 or 6 wheel drive to handle the hills in any interesting track layout [given the $29.99 price]! That being said, I WILL respectfully disagree with another reviewer by noting that our red engine has taken 1.5 years of ABUSE and has continued functioning with aplomb! Ours was able to handle the Magic Mountain layout until recently. It is thus due, mostly, to hard play that I wish this engine had 4 or 6 wheel drive, as it might still be mountain-capable at this time...In sum, our son has had a blast with this engine for 18 mos. I just wish it had the capabilities it did, out-of-box, due to the price. But given that Brio is Euro-superior and thus less subject to market forces than it might be at Wal-Mart, one dare not hold one's breath for such a product improvement. Ta. Dr. L."
2,Sharp Looking Engine,"This is the only train we have encountered with a ""reset"" button underneath which my son finds more interesting than the train itself. Now the bells and whistles go but the train does not. Why in the world did they put that button there when there are already 4 buttons on top? And yes, it does drain those batteries quick!"
3,A bit disappointing,"I bought the toy for my 4-year old son, who already have played a lot with BRIO trains. But the Action Locomotive arrived defective: the noise and light worked, but the machine did not. Amazon.com replaced the toy. Although this time it worked fine, I realized that the locomotive was not capable of climbing bridges, which was very frustrating for my son. And frustrating for me was the fact that the batteries last only a couple of hours of (non-continuous) playing. I have to replace them every 3 or 4 days!"
4,A good book,"First off, this is a great book. It does have a very old-school writing style (think Charlotte Bronte or Charles Dickens) which I love, but others might not enjoy. The setting, story, and excitement level are all there but it is a little shy of a 5 star rating in my book. Here is why:1. The characters were not as realistic or as developed as I would have liked. The main female protagonist is almost frustratingly naive while the main male is distant and exceedingly unemotional.2. Sometimes it reads a little too much like a history book entry.3. There are very similar but better books. A book called Zemindar focuses on the same period in history (with a similar writing style) only is much more engaging. M.M. Kaye's second novel, The Far Pavilions, is also much better.So if you are thinking about purchasing this book my suggestion would be to try either Zemindar or The Far Pavilions first and then read this novel if you want more."
5,Excellent for Lutheran youth and adults,"The ""old"" Small Catechism was getting a little stale in the opinion of this experienced youth ministry leader and Christian educator, and this translation is fresh and seems to be more engaging to Lutherans of all ages."
5,Excellent,"If your Lutheran, than this is what you need. This version comes from the WELS, but is exactly contentually with The Small Catechism from the LCMS. Only this one is better and a MUST HAVE. This one has diagrams, colors, etc. So it's one thing to read a book, but another to see how everything fits into place. I've bought many for friends and family."
1,Terrible binding,The spirals on the top of this steno pad are anoying to say the least. All 5 of the steno pads i bought are not smooth to open or operate because of the spirals on this book are weird i dont know how to describe it. In order to have it open or close coreclty i have to rip the binding out of the first and last holes of the cardboard and the sheets of paper. I recomend buying a different brand
2,Beware of shill reviews.,"I'm really getting irritated by publishers, authors and their friends writing five star reviews for their own books. If you click on the ""see all my reviews"" button next to almost all of the five star reviews, you'll see that they only have one review. This is no coincidence.You might also notice that the less than positive reviews for this have a lot of unhelpful votes, too; that's probably the publisher or author at work again. The saddest thing is that I actually liked this book, but I'm not prepared to give it a positive review in the midst of such dishonesty."
5,power ranger costume,My 4 year old absolutely loved this costume. We gave it to him for his birthday and he was extatic!
1,not happy,"the ball was damaged {slightly} point it was supposed to be new, plus after shipping the price was higher than prices for the same thing at local stores, bad move on my part, lesson learned. do not reccomend this this product."
5,Get Ready to Praise,"I really do enjoy this CD, from the first song to the last you will be bless. If you're already a Deitrick Haddon fan this is a must have to add to your collection."
2,tried today,today was the first day with it. I have noticed no difference in appetite. directions say it may take a few days.It tastes fine.
5,K-Cup French Vanilla,"The item I purchased was delivered in a timely manner and was available at a good price. The shipping cost seemed a bit high, but the product was fresh and received in good condition."
5,Great,"Nothing bad to say about this product, great price, got to me quickly and makes delish coffee! Thanks a ton!"
3,Would drink but not necessarily buy,Taste is a bit watered down and has the aroma of a bowling alley. I'd drink it again but wouldn't go out my way to buy this flavor.
2,Van Houtte Vanilla coffee,Not as impressed with brand of coffee. It was very weak with the flavor. I would recommend the Green Mountain French Vanilla.
3,Only 18 k cups,Coffee is OK. There are better French Vanilla coffee companies (this is weak flavored)3 stars as only 18 cups (NOT 24 cups per box)
1,Awful!,"I received two of these in a sampler package I had ordered through Keurig.com I made one cup, added my Coffeemate and Splenda...and...EWW! It was so bad I poured the rest down the sink and threw away the other K-Cup. I will not be ordering this variety EVER."
3,Too weak,"I had tried a sample, so I purchased a box. I am sorry that I did as it is too mild a coffee for me. It has a nice light vanilla flavor but hardly any coffee taste. I will stick with a med roast coffee."
4,Light and Sweet,I had some of the Green Mountain coffee and it was very acidic and way too strong so I wanted something with more flavor and I bought this one. I think it is a great coffee flavor. Those who say it has no flavor obviously are expecting something like a powdery flavored coffee. This isn't too sweet but sweet enough and has a great after taste unlike most coffee which is too acidic. If you are looking for a light roast coffee with a sweet hint of vanilla then get this for sure! can't wait to try other van houtte flavors!
1,No Taste,"I bought these k-cups at the store to try out in my Keurig single cup coffee maker, they are horrible. Absolutely no french vanilla taste at all, it's not just a weak taste, there is NO TASTE! And to make sure it wasn't just my taste buds, I made several more cups (using 1 k-cup per mug of coffee of course) for family members to see if they could guess what flavor it was, none of them knew and when I told them it was french vanilla, they were of course surprised since you can't taste anything at all.I will never buy Van Houtte again, what a waste of money."
3,Just OK Flavored Coffee,"A sample of these Van Houtte ""French Vanilla K-Cups"" were included with my Keurig B-40 B40 Elite Gourmet Single-Cup Home-Brewing System and it was fairly disappointing to me. This seems to be a ""hit-or-miss"" flavor since there are so many positive reviews and a scattering of those who, like me, don't like it.When made on the ""Large Cup"" setting, the French Vanilla flavor was weak and slightly artificial tasting. It isn't really bad or undrinkable, but I will not be buying this flavor in the future.CFH"
2,"Like it, looks great but ...","Purchased 3 of these faucets at Sam's club for less than $50 each. While installing I discovered that the waterspout does not swivel. If I had known this prior to purchase I would probably not have bought this particular fixture. Needless to say that a spout hanging this far over the sink causes some awkwardness and hazard while trying to wash ones face, either by bumping your head or scraping your hands on the spout. I called tech support at Corrego and was told the spout does not swivel and there is no accessory part that will allow it to swivel. Great looking fixture but not very practical."
4,It's very good.,I love how it very easily takes off all of my makeup quickly. The only drawback is you feel you have to wash your face afterwards(which I do anyway regardless of the product) so I don't mind. But I really love this product. I just bought it again.
4,good book but some A**Hole censored it,"Shiela's Diary is unlike most adult graphic novels from Japan - it follows one continuous story arc through the entire series. The main character, Shiela, is a mysterious witch who is in search of the ideal sex slave. The series is filled with intense sex scenes that involved lesbian sex, hardcore sex in public, and kinky sex toys."
3,Really helpful,"It is very good experiance during reading of this book ,i never experianced the ultimate thrill of achieving this state before thanks to this book ,very simple langugage noncomplicated termsand very normal and realistic approach to whole situationbut still it is yet not giving ultimate sight of soul which beyond everything."
1,Nazi apologist documents early U-boat victories in Gulf,"Using the Nurenburg excuse used by those Nazis convicted of attrocities against humanity, this author has the nerve to claim the U-boat sailors ""were just doing their job."" She takes obvious delight in the sinking of each American ship. She calls our Navy ""inexperienced"" and the Nazis ""experts."" Just before her evil heros finally start faltering later in the war, she discontinues her narative. The perspective of this book is only a few steps away from ""Springtime for Hitler"" except she doesn't mean it as a joke. Avoid it at all cost."
3,barbara hannay can do so much better,"Three stars for it's OK. It starts as a cattle station story with quite a bit of detail about how new cattle are handled. Camille is a journalist and Jonno is the subject of an article about station life after the original story about him as a desirable outback bachelor hits a snag. They are instantly attracted according to the story, but I didn't understand why, and of course there are obstacles before he follows her to Paris and proposes. With all of this, it was still kind of flat in my opinion. I have read other Barbara Hannay books which I think were much better written."
5,A fantastic album!,"Pam has an amazing voice - head to Beale St and check out Pam and Terry. Buy 'From The Heart', a great album from a woman with a kind heart."
4,Added to my collection,"Throughout my college years I have managed to collect at least three different editions of this wonderful little book. I find the illustrated edition interesting but somewhat unnecessary. The illustrations don't impart much of an edge to this book, IMO."
2,Boorish,"I need a resource, not a coffee table book. The font is hard to read. The pictures do not seem to make sense with the content, and it is hard to find the rule you need. Grrr.If they are going to jazz this gem up, they need to remember that we *use* this book. The artwork should complement and aid the understanding, not confuse the reader.Blah.Why a dog on the cover? Why????"
3,stick to the old Strunk & White,"The new illustrated version is no improvement over the original Strunk & White, which can't be beat as a writing guide. My copy came with no dust jacket, so I couldn't even give it as a gift."
3,As Promised,"It's alright. I had to buy this book for school, so I am not too thrilled about reading it, but it's definitely informative and explains everything to you like you were a child, so it's a quick way to study basic composition, including grammar."
1,Apparently the illustrator hasn't read the book,"Look folks, read the publisher's blurb about this book. Especially pay attention to the part where it quotes Whatshername describing herself, or her work, or some such thing. Apparently she hasn't even learned that sentences are supposed to contain verbs.Seriously, this books is a travesty. The publishers have taken one of the greatest books on writing in English and have trivialized it by adding illustrations that profit little and editorial changes that destroy the book's original integrity. Please buy the original instead of this edition."
1,Strunk & White prostituted for a new century,"If you want to see the clean, elegant prose of the true Strunk & White turned into a mamby-pamby of gender-inclusiveness and political correctness, buy this book.If you want silly, pointless illustrations randomly scattered around your manual of style, then by all means, spend far more than you need to.Otherwise, forget this book and buy the real one!"
3,Let's See the Pictures,"A copy of The Elements of Style has been on my shelf for more than 20 years now. It is a timeless, marvelous reference. Here, now, we have an illustrated edition. Wouldn't it be nice to actually see a few of the illustrations? I know what the original says. It's the pictures that make this edition much more expensive than the paperback version, so why not let me browse through a few here online? Guess I'll have to go to a bookstore (remember those?) and actually turn through the pages if this online offering won't show them to me."
3,mutton dressed up as lamb,wonderful presentation of a text that is showing its age and not nearly as accessable as it should be - ironic given the intent of the autor
1,*ahem* I'm supposedly in college?!,Why have I been required to buy (let alone read) a poorly-illustrated book for a college class??? What a strange world in which we live. Fifty years ago the very idea of this book would have been ridiculed; today it is lauded. I yearn for the past.
3,"Cute, but...","The illustrations are interesting and nice. But this edition is certainly not a ""user"". Page numbers are all ""inside"" - along the binding side and at the bottom of the pages. To accommodate the illustrations you can go six pages without a page number. When you try to use this book as a reference, the illustrations just get in the way, breaking up your train of thought.Not that I'm pushing book sales, but if you get this illustrated edition (or plan of giving it as a gift), do yourself a favor and also get the paperback version. That way you have something you can actually use, as well as having a volume for muse."
1,Kindle version is Not illustrated.,"It says illustrated, in my table of contents, but it is not. I only purchased this to have the illustrated version."
1,College Book that simply teaches grammar that is so confusing that it's just not worth caring about.,"My review is based on the content.... it's mostly about ""how to"" write the ""correct way"", and the current ""rules"" of literature. I'm sorry, but times have changed, and some of the things expressed in this book are simply not said/written in modern society."
5,"What, no preview?",This is a fabulous update of a well-known and often cherished book. It is much more than a reference book. Maira Kalman's illustrations bring out the humor and add whimsy without taking anything away from the content. I am very disapointed that Amazon has chosen to omit even a sample of these illustrations. They give us no motivation to purchase a new copy of this book! If you want to see more of the inside of this book.
5,Great addition to a classic work,"If you're considering purchasing this book, you are probably already aware of the extreme usefulness and quality of the original Strunk and White version. But the wonderful illustrations by Kalman make this book ""blossom"" for those of us who are VERY visually oriented! The illustrations are a great addition and could not be considered anything but a gift to such a timeless work."
5,Love the illustrations,"The illustrations are not as extensive as I would have expected, but the ones that are there add nicely to this classic reference."
4,Very good resource,"Although, I'm not a fan of The Elements of Style this illustrated version in a nice edition. It expounds on the text only version, but other than that, there's nothing really new."
5,I found it to be the perfect gift,"Strunk and White, which has kept college essayists in line for the better part of a century is already a fixture reference guide. I have no idea where Maira Kalman got the unique idea to illustrate it, but the result is a perfect gift for any slightly eccentric lover of the English language"
2,Pleasant illustrations that add little to the book,"The illustrations are pleasant, even beautiful at times. I agree, however, with some of the other reviewers who were disappointed because the illustrations add little to the original Strunk and White classic. What is the point of illustrating examples such as, ""Somebody else's umbrella"" and other snippets of grammatical examples that in illustrated form are out of context and irrelevant to the book's purpose? Do we really need an edition of Strunk and White for the sake of whimsey? The book is a tool for writers and is beloved for decades for a reason. The addition of illustrations feels like an exercise in distraction."
3,A little beat up,Overall it was a bit more beat up than I expected but still use-able. Worth the price I paid for it.
2,Correct spelling is a PRINCIPAL requirement for a writing guide...,"In theory, I would completely approve of the idea of enlivening this useful classic writing guide with illustrations. However, having examined this particular edition, I can't get past the horrifying error at the top of page 147, in which the spelling ""principle"" is substituted for the correct form of the adjective ""principal,"" as in ""main,"" or ""chief."" This passage is supposedly from the introduction to the book's first edition by William Strunk, Jr., who would have made no such mistake. (It is however a common one, to judge by its appearance in at least one of the Amazon reader reviews of this book).Didn't anyone at The Penguin Press proofread this book? To introduce this type of basic error into a revered reference book is an unforgiveable disservice to the masters of writing. Strunk and White must be rolling over in their graves..."
1,I'm made as hell and not going to take it anymore!,"I am tired of being ripped off by these music companies. Do they really think people are so stupid as to pay money for this! The Allman Brothers rock, but what was Sony thinking. I have asked them to recall the disk, and replace mine with VHS. I urge you to do the same. Do not buy this disk!"
1,Buy the VHS and hope these DA's wakeup and rerelease the DVD,"Why couldn't they make the DVD like the VHS copy? no editing, i don't want Liz Reed and Whipping Post edited. If the want to include the interviews, it's a Freaking DVD. Put them on a bonus track. come on guys, the ABB and us fans deserve better."
1,Awful DVD,"The VHS version is better. The DVD version has interviews over songs. Awful, awful, awful. Stick with the VHS version (I purchased the VHS and threw the DVD in the trash - and that's where the DVD belongs)."
1,Very disapointing.,I am a huge Allman Brothers fan. I bought the disk thinking it was a concert video. Nothing but interviews with music playing in the background. Luckily I was able to exchange it for something else. Cannot belive the A-Bros would endorse this .
4,"Great, but also a bit disappointed.","The set list looks great on the box, but some great songs are interrupted by interviews. However, it was also quite informative."
3,Pay Attention,"First of all, this is not a rating, but a request. Would someone ***please*** review the ***VHS*** version of The Allman Brothers Band Live At Great Woods? We all know some idiot editor ruined the DVD, but this isn't about that. The DVD has it's own page. I would like to know what people think of the VHS version. That is why I opened the VHS page."
3,Just a bit of hype.,"This is a great era for the ABB. This vid is great fun. Too bad that ""Blue Sky"" is a talk-over piece. And more cam time for Allan Woody would have been nice. Still like it, though."
1,"GREAT VHS, TERRIBLE DVD","I echo most of the other reviews - this was an OUTSTANDING concert on VHS that was absolutely butchered when converting to DVD. Edited versions of songs, jams interrupted by interviews (being a DVD why couldn't the interviews be separate???). Worst of all, ""Jessica"" was eliminated from the DVD.Let Sony know how you feel. Maybe if enough people do this they will realize the money they are losing."
1,"Yes, the editing ruins this DVD","I used to have this on VHS and was ecstatic when the DVD came out. Although the VHS was itself not the entire show at Great Woods (which is what we really want), nonetheless, what we got was terrific. But it's just a travesty what happened on the way to the DVD editing room. It's all chopped up with interviews interrupting the solos, truncated and/or missing songs. It's so irritating that I will never view it again. Now, if this show (with Warren, Allen, Dickey, Greg, Marc, Butch and Jaimoe) were re-released without the horrible edits it would be a ""must have"".Until then - avoid it."
1,Disgraceful,"This DVD is a disgrace. Pathetic. It's actually an outstanding film of an Allman Brothers concert, but the producers ruined it by interrupting the songs with interviews. How can they be so stupid? How can the members of The Allman Brothers allow the record company to butcher the songs like that? Don't they have enough interest in their own music to pay attention to what gets released? If you want to see the full length versions of the songs in this concert, buy the VHS version because it's all there. As for the DVD release, it's such a shame that corporations and record labels show such disrespect for music. The Allman Brothers are one of the greatest live bands of all time and there isn't very much concert footage that has been released, so why did they have to ruin this wonderful concert?"
1,Please re-release this DVD unbutchered!!,I can't believe they actually eliminated songs that were on the original VHS tape. WHY!?? And to interrupt the other songs and trash this amazing concert is such a travesty. I hope whoever was responsible for this mess was fired.EVERYONE: PLEASE WRITE DIRECTLY TO THE ALLMAN BROTHERS SO WHEN CAN GET THIS RE-RELEASED PROPERLY UNEDITED.
2,Another Record Industry Fumble,"I too am a big ABB fan, and have never been disappointed at their concerts, but this DVD isn't what it could or should be! How can they claim this to be approx. 90 minutes? It's 55! Anybody that has seen the boys in concert knows that they are hardly breaking a sweat after 55 minutes. Furthermore, it is ignorant to place interviews in the middle of songs. I might play the disc 100 times and never get tired of the music, but I don't need to hear Dickey talk about the naming of ""In Memory of Elizabeth Reed"" more than once. Isn't that common sense? The music that is played is very good, and it's a shame they didn't do a better job of putting together this disc!"
1,Don't waste the money,"What were they thinking? I bought this for the music, not to listen to interviews. They certainly bungled their use of DVD technology on this one. This DVD lacks one important thing; the Allman Brothers making music.Don't bother."
1,"""It's the performance, stupid !""","Just my opinion,I'm also a huge fan of the ABB. The music is great, what there is of it. But whoever produced the DVD cut out, and interrupted the music. That's pretty much ""blasphemy"" in my opinion. I got this DVD to see and hear the band play music. To try to get a feel for the live performance.IMO, the folks who chose the format did a disservice to the ABB. I don't have the VHS, but it sounds to me from the other reviewers that it is the way to go."
1,Why Is the DVD Version so Butchered???,"I first saw the DVD version at Best Buy some years ago and immediately saw that ""Jessica"" was not on the DVD version and I smelled a rat. Then I read the reviews and I'm appalled! Can we petition the manufacturer to release the original VHS version on DVD?"
2,Get the VHS version if you can!!!,"Like a lot of reviewers here, I bought the VHS edition when it first came out...nothing but the highest praise for that version. There is perhaps no better single video that so superbly documents what these guys do onstage ( at least not with Dickey Betts in the lineup ). I was fortunate enought to have stumbled upon the DVD for rent first...which I did, and that was it, for reasons stated so well by everybody else here. By the way, the VHS tape can be copied to DVD, which I heartily recommend!"
1,A Disappointing Rip Off,Do not buy this DVD!! Buy the VHS instead. Unlike the VHS (which also contains an extra song--Jessica) this DVD edits some songs short (e.g. Blue Sky) and inserts interviews into the middle of other songs (the VHS just gives you the wonderful music). This DVD is a Disappointing Rip Off.
2,Get the VHS version,"What a major disappointment!!! I have the VHS and was expecting the same only better sound and picture on the DVD, boy was I suprised. The packaging says ""Blue Sky"" in included, don't believe it, it's less than 2 minutes and what there is of it is stepped on by interviews. ""In Memory Of Elizabeth Reed"" is all there but also stepped on. Also where is ""Jessica"". Stay away from the DVD and buy the VHS."
1,"Disappointing, but the problem could be fixed.","I thought the disc would contain complete songs, but it only has bits and pieces of most. The disc breaks up many songs with interviews. It would have been a perfect opportunity for the DVD authors to do the interviews in separate menus, but have the entire music selections uninterrupted. We would not have the original television program, but something better instead. What was most disappointing is that the Allman Brothers are a great band, and I really looked forward to hearing the music. But, alas, I'll have to wait for another disc to get a real concert.Also, beware, the running time is under an hour, not the 90 minutes indicated on the package."
2,Misleading information on DVD case.,"I'm disappointed like the rest. I bought the VHS version several years ago and expected an exact copy of it on the DVD. WRONG!!! To make matters worse the DVD cover says ""Running Time: Approx. 90 minutes"" The ACTUAL running time is 55 minutes. What a rip-off!!"
5,My take on the VHS,"VHS version........Guess they were planing on using ""part"" of the concert footage for some Japanise special? They were so on that night, I'm sure after reviewing the footage, the whole concert had to be released. It's that good, right up there with stuff Santana puts out. They haven't lost their touch at all.If your a hard-rocker, it don't get any better than this. With over 50 concert videos in the collection now, most are just so-so. This one is close to being a 10 out of 10. The best thing is; It's 100% concert without the typical ""talking"" BS. Great audio and video footage. A++."
1,A Great band but a most disappointing DVD,"I Purchased the DVD with great anticipation only after viewing the VHS copy I had in my music collection, What were they thinking. Interruptions during the music with interviews although I like the interviews put it on a different track (Angle). Most songs were edited so you do not get the complete song, Guitar solos missing, Drum solo cut short, Whipping Post 2 minutes? With today's technology I would have expected better, much better than the VHS. The running time is not 90 minutes I am returning my DVD today. I am a southern rock lover, as well as a Allman fan but this DVD Stinks."
2,"Poor Planning for The Allman Brothers, Reissue It Please","I own the VHS version and hoped for an incredible DVD because of my satisfaction with the VHS version. Especially the 5.1 Dolby sound. What a disappointment! When I went to Blue Sky, all I got was interviews with Greg & Dicky with music playing in the background-Blue Sky for all intents and purposes isn't there. Some songs do benefit from the sound improvement but overall a real disappointment when you understand what could've been done with today's technology. Who's in charge over there? Save your money!!!"
1,pure sadness.,I was also expecting an incredible DVD version of this fantastic vhs show. I urge you NOT to buy the DVD version! Stick with the vhs...it gives you a great show. I could not believe how cheated I felt when I threw this DVD on. What a shame. I am still mad and from this day forward I am not buying anything from SONY DVD until I read some reviews from the folks who bought them.
1,WHAT A COMPLETE WASTE OF A BEAUTIFUL CONCERT,"Shame on SONY's Editors who RUINED this concert with Interviews.I happen to own the LASERDISC version which is the FULL CONCERT, No interviews and i have it on DVD. The only bad news about the Laserdisc, is that the audio is only 2.0 Stereo and the video quality is also less than this DVD. But at least it's the entire concert UNCUT. This Official DVD release broke my heart!!!Bam Bam."
4,Bethania's homage to crooner Roberto Carlos,"Roberto Carlos started off as a teen rocker in the late 1950s... By the early '70s he shifted gears to become Brazil's answer to Julio Iglesias -- a Spanish-language pop crooner. This is Bethania's tribute to Carlos's work, and it sticks mainly to the cheesier, synthy-er side of his style. If you're a fan of synthy ballads, this might be the record for you..."
2,Just OK.. but nothing else,"Ok... so for power... you know what to expect as this is the same as original that your Typhoon came with... As for quality... horrible... yes.. horrible. I've been too long sticking to this type , and just building my Typhoon with outer type - at least for power/money it definitely worth it.This is waaaaaaaaaaaaaaay overpriced product, and merely delivering 'minimum'...Sorry, my time is too valuable to waist it for further description of it from what I've already said. At least search for 1/2 price if you must really go with gearbox involved motor, or at least twice as much delivering Watts."
1,Dangerous,"While I appreciate Wright's defense of Paul as a faithful expositor of the teaching's of Christ, his book, as with all Covenantal Nominism undermines the gospel of our Lord.Justification is indeed about how one is saved, not merely who is included in the covenant. While Wright brings helpful insight into the mind of a 1st century Jewish convert, he overstates his case by attacking the orthodox and historic Christian understanding of justification by faith apart from works. Serious consideration of Romans 5 is not given in this book, and the Lutheran/Reformed/Evangelical understanding of justification as the foresnic imputation of Christ's righteousness to undeserving sinners is scoffed at as unscholarly.But nothing could be further from the truth. Those who do get this book, I must recommend you also purchase ""Counted Righteous in Christ"" by John Piper, and exegetical defense of the orthodox understanding of justification."
3,Recommend Conditionally,"Not finished with this book yet (about 2/3 through). For me, there were a lot of new ideas and, so far, I find the effort rewarding. But it is not an easy read. It is a scholarly text and a better biblical foundation would have helped greatly."
4,"Wright on, brother!","Ok, I admit my review title is silly but that is one thing this book is not. It is a compelling and brief introduction to the apostle Paul and his teaching from a modified new perspective.One may not always agree with Wright but he always raises important questions, interacts with the most important literature, and engages in profound and deep biblical exegesis.I eagerly look forward to Wright's tome on this topic in the ""Christian origins"" series.The other reviews were pretty fair. As for the fellow who only gave him one star, come on cake-walker... I'm a conservative, reformed evangelical too but ""you gots to give Wright his props"".Please don't dismiss Wright because he doesn't tow the party line! He's one of the handful of scholars that I believe people will still be paying apt attention to 50 years or more from now."
2,Takes the wrong turn in guiding children,"Crots had a good idea, but I think she used the wrong methods to get the message across. Most of the pages tell about what ""Daniel"" doesn't do - or points out negative behavior. Why not make the message using positive behaviors? I think it would be more encouraging and more interesting if a more positive attitude were taken. For instance - ""Daniel does not put his fingers in his mouth or up his nose."" That spreads germs!"" says Crots. True, but a little stomach turning in description.The wording isn't colorful enough to hold a small child's attention."
2,Leaks at random,"This is my least favorite cup that we have tried. It doesn't leak when dropped, but the liquid tends to come up the straw (when open or closed). I've checked and double-checked that the straw is in correctly and I can't figure out why this happens, but I've read reviews where other moms had similar problems. It is insulated which is good for milk or hot days. The straw is 2 pieces and easy to clean and assemble. The cup is top-rack dishwasher safe."
1,"Not a ""practical handbook"" for today.","This is a reprint of a book first issued in 1930. It does have some fascination, for instance in the comparison of gas vs. oil lighting for your workspace. For my purposes as a beginner looking for basic methods for mechanical watch cleaning and repair, it was practically useless.It gives equal time to fusee and Geneva watches and may well be of interest to an experienced person looking for a glimpse into the past, but not reccomended as a ""practical handbook."""
4,The Man In Black Sings About The Man In White!,"While some artists singing about God may make you raise your eyebrows in unbelief, Cash makes you raise your eyebrows in delight. With so many songs previously that dealt with spirituality, Johnny Cash goes back to his original roots with some old hymn songs and some songs that he wrote himself. Obviously, the overall theme is ""God"" and Cash sings with the emotion that we have all grown to love. Fans of Cash's earlier work should still love this because it's the same style, except what he is singing about has more substance."
4,What a great cd,"This is such a great album. I'm not a big fan of gospel music, nor am I religious, but I just can't help loving this cd. The harmonies on ""Were You There When They Crucified My Lord?"" are outstanding, and I love ""The Kneeling Drunkard's Plea."" But the best song on there is definately ""Redemption."" What a powerful song. I recommend it to everyone."
2,Warning - serious scholars only!,"I have to warn any person who may be buying this for the artwork. As much as there needs to be a new book on the collection at the National Portrait Gallery, this book is sadly not that book.All. 912. pages.are. Black and white.NO COLOR!Why would they do this?! I saw this at a local bookstore and all but ripped it off the shelf in my haste to finally get my hands on this long awaited book. My jaw fell open as I flipped in growing dismay.The images are tiny, like postage stamps and only black and white! Only a true scholar would get any sort of benefit from this. And frankly, the internet could be used as a valuable reference tool for that at a lot cheaper price.There needs to be a book like this, 900 pages or so with at least 60 percent in color. The works of art demand that much to be appreciated fully. This is yet another one of those 'trick' art books in which you find a majority of black and white images, a real pet peeve of mine.Buyer beware."
5,INCREDIBLE READ + DETAIL,"As I quickly discovered when carousing a local retail store, this particular biography delivers so much more than competitive works, for the same price! For starters, the page count is double of others. Muhammad's comprehensive and quite impressive family tree is outlined in the first chapter. Also, the entire account is told from a Muslim perspective, as opposed to a Western writer trying to interpret Islamic lore and tradition from within their limited construct, giving the reader a sense of ""insider information"". It narrates Muhammad's life as it has been told in the Muslim world for 14 centuries. This alone makes it worth the read. However, there is a lot more."
5,sufilive.com,"BismiAllah Heeraman NeeraheemAssalamu Alykum wa rahmatuAllah wa barkartuif you liked this book as much as I did, please tune in daily for a live broadcast of the authors husband Mawlana sheik nazim (May Allah give him longlife and good health)it broadcasts daily [...]such an amazing book! I highly recommend this book!"
1,Unauthentic,I purchased this book without reading the 1-star reviews- BIG MISTAKE. I should've have read it because not only would I have not bought the book I would've realised that this book has baseless hadiths and basically spreading lies.
1,Deal with the real,"The hadith in this book is fictional. It captures a feeling not fact. If I would have known what I know now, I would have gotten ""The Sealed Nectar"" instead isbn: 159144070X. Deal with the authentic. Don't deal with this book. Now you know. Don't waste your time or money. May God guild us straight.Peace"
5,"Excellent book, Excellent Read.",I would recommend this book to anyone who is of the Ahl-as-Sunnah faith. The book approaches the life of Rasulullah (s.a.w.) in a much richer fashion and is an enjoyable read. It must be noted that the author of this book is the wife of a well known Naqshbandi Sheikh.
5,Outstanding musical arrangenents,Wow a musical masterpiece. This cd is one of my favorites. Expertly crafted and the compositions are wonderful. Jazz at it's best. Thoroughly enjoyable and entertaining.
3,"Long wait, fair product","I had to wait almost 2 weeks from the time I placed this order before they even shipped. I thought this to be incredibly ridiculous! I ordered a table seperately from elsewhere and had received that table, had it set up, and had purchased folding chairs seperately after a few days because I was still waiting on this order to ship. When I finally did receive the chairs, they were easy to assemble, they look great, and they're reasonably comfortable. The wood does chip up pretty easily, however, which is bothersome in a home with a 2 year old! However, given the price I paid, I can't complain too much about the cheap quality."
4,chairs,"these are basic, but they came well packaged and easy to put together. simple dusting keeps them clean. I'm just happy they look nice, pretty sturdy, & that they were at a reasonable price."
3,Light sturdy chairs,"Bought 3 sets of these chairs. Fairly easy to assemble, and are much lighter than expected. Also very well put together.Edit: One of the backs of these chairs broke. Wasn't as sturdy as I thought. Repaired with Gorilla glue..."
2,Pass this book up.........its almost as worse as the third.,"When I picked up this book, I thought it would be about a new ship that was once again exploring the Genesis planets like in Star Trek III. However, I was MAJORLY DISAPPOINTED.It is yet ANOTHER novel that is not needed for this story. There should have been only 2 books in this storyline. Once Maltz and Carol Marcus were gone (I'm not even going to whine about Saavik not being in this story!), then it should have ended nicely.This novel seems very forced! ""Let's mix in all the characters that were introduced in the earlier books, so we can call it Genesis!"" There is NO EXCITEMENT and NO INTERESTING SUBPLOTS. I skipped through most of the story to only see how Picard's team handled this new adventure.Save your money, folks! Discover the relaunch of Deep Space Nine and Voyager instead!"
2,"If this is good Trek, blech!","Although I am a fan of all the Star Trek TV series, I only read the occasional Trek book. If this book is typical or considered fine, I'm glad I haven't read more. The characters were flat, much of the dialogue bland - and this based on characters with rich, complex development from TV! I realize that authors' have limited liberty to work with the main characters from the series, but numerous times I nearly set the book aside out of disappointment. Spoiler Alert! Quick - how do we save Deanna from the monstrous serpent? How else: her empathic powers convince the beast ""We are friends from long ago."" Books such as this serve best as a bad example: here's how you don't do it. Although it's been many years since I read it, I'd recommend ""Vendetta"" over ""Genesis Force"" any day."
2,"Beating a dead horse, but doing it well.","Frankly, I would have been glad to see the whole ""Genesis Device"" concept die with ""Star Trek III: The Search For Spock"". The first two books in this series did a fair job of telling an interesting story resurrecting the concept, but the concept itself was already a moldering corpse even then. Book three had unquestionably passed the saturation point, and only a very well-told story with some very interesting characters saved this book from being a total waste of time and space; if the concept hadn't already been thoroughly played out, it would have been worth four stars, almost five. As it is, it ALMOST persuaded me to give it a third star, but I'm afraid that doing so might encourage the author to keep more ""Genesis"" stories coming. Please, please, please, let this concept die; it was ready to be put down twenty years ago."
2,just clench your teeth...,"Well,it's my OWN opinion...and nobody must agree with me...but why the writters almost always must(?)do strange or sometimes just stupid things with Alexander??It's disgusting.Why they couldn't do something like that with anyone else:-(?To add,this book have poor plots,and only merely describe the Aluwnans .There are my thinks after my first reading-maybe when I reach for this book again, I'll be in better mood,and will write here about ""Genesis Force"" sth more positive."
3,Good history but too much romance,"I really liked the very complete historical content of this novel, based on historical content alone I would have given it a strong 4 stars. However, there was just too much superfluous romantic content for my taste. At the risk of being label a sexist, for that very reason I rarely buy a book written by a woman and probably wouldn't have bought this one if I realized the author was a woman. In addition to the romantic content there was another technique that irritated me, but it was necessary to make the romantic angle work. Namely, the book contained way too many coincidentally meetings of people. People seemed to be tripping over people they knew everywhere they went.I'm of mixed minds about whether or not I'll buy the sequels to this book. I assume the author will continue the romantic mode, this for me is be a big factor.Long story short, if you like history AND romance novels you'll love this book; if you don't like romance novels, not so much."
2,interesting subject; flawed delivery,"I picked up this book because it dealt with a subject that I knew little about. While I am glad to have learned something about the events depicted, I felt that the presentation was substandard. The subplots were pointless and distracting, the writing was almost juvenile, the characters were unrealistic and one-dimensional. Everything was black or white -- the participants in the rebellion were demi-gods fighting a holy war, the English and their sympathizers were the personification of evil. Not the stuff of a ""good read"", despite the interesting subject matter."
1,I struggled to pick it up...,"Never have I been so bored by a novel set in Ireland. While I found the historical aspect to be informative, the story itself was tedious and silly, with the most contrived fictional characters. I struggled to pick this book up each night (rather than put it down). I would rather read a straight history book and visit Dublin for my facts, and leave the Irish fiction to Emma Donoghue and even Maeve Binchy."
5,Brilliant,"This is a beautiful book,poignant,stunning,gripping.And there is something in the way Morgan Llywelyn writes that without her having to use any great excess of adjectives you see the picture she is painting with perfect clarity.An important novel for anyone to read but an absolute nesceccity for the Irish fanatics.I also suggest ""Six Days to Shake an Empire"" and Frank Delaney's ""Ireland"".The story of the Easter Rebellion always reminds me of one of Jimmy Stewart's lines in Mr.Smith goes to Washington,when he says that the lost causes are the only ones worth fighting for.Brilliant,brilliant,brilliant."
3,Much more than 1916,"1916 promises by its title that it will be a novel of the rebellion of 1916 - not so much. I like stories of battles and struggle. I like tales of strategy and stress. I like tales of war, tactics and weakness revealed. 1916 is not much about the elements I listed.Instead, 1916 is about a fictional family and their life in an Ireland where the Irish barely survive the English occupation. Then, later in the book, it becomes about the 1916 revolution. To me, what separates this from a great historical novel is the fictional part. Please stick to history Professor Llywelyn, you are an expert there, and entertaining. 1916 is a let down because I expect focus on the history - told well. Cut out the first third (it is 540 pages after all), and you have a truely great book."
5,Exceptional,"I shouldn't have been so surprised; this author is simply a magician when it comes to crafting history into a readable, enjoyable glimpse of the past. I used to think that I hated history, but the more I read by authors as talented as Llywelyn, the more I know how important it is that we are aware of our past. She has the ability to transport her reader into the lives of her characters, even when you know the ultimate outcome is not good--you willingly go down that road, holding her hand. Thank you Morgan."
4,Historical fiction with a capital 'H',"As much a history as historical fiction, Llywelyn populates the story of the Easter Rising in Ireland with many more real people than fictional, along with copious notes indicating her historical sources for the details she weaves into the tale.It would be hard to find a better subject for an historical novel, and Llywelyn does a fine job of balancing story-telling with historical accuracy and completeness. Some of the characters remain two-dimensional, but there are so many characters in this tale, that it's hardly surprising.An all around good read, and a great way to learn a lot more about this time in Irish history."
2,Rising Needs no Embellishment,"I had high expectations when I bought this book. I had heard good things about Morgan and was excited about reading something about the Rising that added some drama, unlike the strickly factual interpretations I have read in the past. What I learned from reading 1916 however, is that the Easter Rebellion needs no dramatization or embellishment. The Titanic, a broken priest, a prositute heroine, are things that simply detract from what is one of the more telling stories of modern times. The book wasn't completely without merit. The truths it did decide to deal with, it dealt with accurately."
4,A good read. But a better listen - the reader does great,"1916 continues the tradition of trying to understand the Irish - British problem. The all encompassing ""Trinity"" by Uris is the paramount of this kind of novel. But 1916 tells the story in the same way and provokes you into wanting more and more. The blunders made by the British in dealing with their cousins, the Irish, are so sad that its a crime. 1916 is just plain good. The beginning may be contrived, a bit. But it sets up the interesting cross-play between Amwerica and Ireland as captured in one family. Enjoy!"
3,The Religion of Nature,"I was rather disappointed in this book, perhaps due to it being written over 100 years ago and in Great Britain. It wasn't what I was expecting, but still a nice read about one person's view of religion and nature, for what it's worth."
3,"2 - Loved, 2 - Yuck","Loved ""The Countess's Pleasure"". Interesting world and characters and the story was intriging and HOT!Enjoyed ""The Breed Next Door"" so much that, although I passed up Lora Leigh's Breeds books before (the reviewers seem to agree that the stories are interesting but the female characters are idiots), I decided go ahead and try out the books.Could not get into ""Falling for Anthony"". Did NOT find the characters interesting and the story seemed to drag.Read only 2 chapters of ""The Blood Kiss"" and was done. So did not care what happened.So, 5 stars for the first 2 stories and 1-2 for the last 2 stories."
4,Excellent Story,"My review is for the book by Lora Leigh. She is the reason I bought it and though, I will eventually read the other stories, I think her story is well worth the money. The only reason for my 4 instead of 5 stars is that it was TOO SHORT!!! I really enjoyed the story and wished it were a full length novel. I really did get into the characters. It reminded me a lot of Tempting the Beast... which now I will pull it up and reread the series. I love almost all of what Ms. Leigh is putting out and would recommend her to anyone getting into the genre."
5,HOT! HOT! HOT!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is one of the best anthologys published recently. All four paranormal romances are full of erotic romance. Emma Holly and Lora Leigh are some of the queens of erotic literature.IF you buy this book you will not be disappointed. Every story was different and made you wish the story was longer.Emma Holly tells us the story of the Demon who danced at the Ladies Lotus. We saw him briefly in THE DEMON'S DAUGHTER. I loved finding out the rest of the story.Lora Leigh introduces us to the Breeds. Men gene engineered with animal genes. What real Alpha males! Bet this one becomes a series. The characters were fasinating and the animal characteristics were intriging.In the third we discover men alittle less than angels who are made to guard us against demons and vampires.The fourth delves into the world of werewolves and vampires. Some vampires are made, some are born, and some are hunted. A different take on the vampire tale, but interesting nevertheless."
3,Hot Spell,The Breed Next Door: Who knew there could be so much more to the guy next door. A hot and compelling read.
3,Hot Spell,I liked this book. I especailly like the Countess Pleasure. It was like a coming of age story and I like those.
5,Wonderful Product,THis is a great product - I have been raving about it to all my friends since I got it.
5,I love the feel good book,I love the feel good book! This book deserves five stars and makes me feel good! When I am sad I want to cry and that makes me feel good. When I want to hug someone I hug and that makes me feel good. This book touches my heart and hopefully it will touch yours.Eunace B. age-11
5,Good wireless thermometer,This is the 4th a wireless thermometer that I have bought over the years and it is the best.
2,NOT Recommended,"I was taken in by the Timex brand reputation ""Takes a linking and keeps on ticking""... This clock/thermometer is a far cry from the Timex I knew in the past. It has a flaw in the battery holder that when moved too fast, it looses power to the display and you have to reset the time & date. Also, you cannot place the secondary temp sensor too far away (<12ft) or it will not read the signal. Looks good, works well when left UNTOUCHED, low quality, made in China."
2,had some problems,"Right from the beginning, had problems with this device. Could not switch from Celsius to Farenheit on the outside device ... constant beeping ... then just quit. Timex did quickly send a new one when sent in under warranty."
1,Does not work as advertised,The front of the package claims the remote temperature sensor can be up to 100 ft away. The literature inside the package claims the sensor can be up to 82 feet away. I found the sensor could be no more than 4 to 5 feet away and in the same room. The base unit would not receive a signal through exterior or interior walls. I sent it back.
4,thermometer,works great seems to be right on with temp outside sensor need to be put in a spot were it will not get wet batteries seem to last about a year well worth the money.
1,Quality is not cheap. Should have purchased a better unit.,"I Purchased two, one only occasionally syncs with the outside unit. I should have spent more money on a better unit."
1,failed after minimum use,"Item failed after about 3 months. contacted mfr, who said would repair or replace if i sent to them and paid for repairs. so much for warranty!bought a similar item retail (for less than paid for Timex) and now happy but smarter about buying online."
4,Works Great!,Worked great out of the box - - very accurate from what I can determine - I'm certainly happy with the product and the seller.
2,High Concept Marketing - Low Flow,"I was hella disappointed. I thought this would be a cool CD from the cover, but basically there is no feeling in the production. Whoever put this together went low budget & is counting on the cover to sell some discs. Your basic new school junk, plus there are NO FAT TRACKS. What Spanish it has is just buzz word BS representing. If you want GOOD Rap in Spanish check Orishas - A Lo Cubano, Molotov, Control Machete - Artilleria Pesada...Presente or one of the many other rappers who do it better."
2,A little thin,"The part of this book that deals strictly with cigar brands and characteristics of those brands is ok, but could use more detail and more photos. Unfortunately, the author devoted too much space to a very shoddy synopsis of Cuban history. Instead of enlightening the reader, the author made clear his own lack of background in Cuban history; since this isn't supposed to be a history book, perhaps the author could have either left out that section, or had someone more qualified write it. Disappointing."
3,Cubans: The Ultimate Cigars,Good book and good info. I have kept this book and have it as a coffee table book now.
5,Around the world with Charles Darwin,"The book is exactly as I hoped it would be. In per fect condition, interesting, with beatiful Images by the artsts who travelled around the world on the Beagle with Darwin and before him.After reading this book I wish to read the books written by Darwin himself and I shall."
1,Not what I expected,This is not the original Moosewood cookbook I owned in the late 1970's/early 1980's. That cookbook contained a Cashew Chili recipe (that called for tomato juice)that was awesome and the reason I for which I had purchased this one. But it's not in there! Anyone out there have it?
4,Author speechs her mind,"This book is a delight to read, I feel like saying, ""Right on sister!"" but that is because I agree with her point of view.I see this more as a book and less of a textbook, textbooks are one-sided."
5,Great game for all ages,"My family loves this game. We play it with our 4 and 5 yr old boys a lot. I like the combination of the older movie and current movie questions. My only complaint is with the metal character pieces. They are pretty flimsy and we have already broken one which cannot be repaired and I don't know where to buy a replacement piece. Other than that, the game is good for families with kids of all ages."
4,"Fun, but only for 4 or 5 replays","My kids were excited to play it, but lost interest after about the 5th game. They said that they were getting the same questions. As a parent, this is pretty frustrating, especially since Eco Rangers ([...]) has at least 50 replays. There was no problem with the interface and it was very easy to start, however. Scene It just needs to put more movies into the game and it would be great!"
5,Family Fun,This is our family's favorite game. We have had it since last Christmas and still play it continously. We can play it for hours. This is great for quality family time and especially if you love Disney as much as we do.
5,Great family game,"My husband,boys and I have enjoyed playing Disney Scene It. My boys, of course, know more about the movies than their parents, but we still have a lot of fun playing."
5,Wonderful,This is the best game I have ever played!!!!!!!!!!!!! I played it six times in the first two days I had it
5,Great collar,"This is the second sporn collar that I have purchased. Both my dog and I think the collar are great. The collars are sturdy and my dog appears to comfortable wearing the halter. It has certainly helped reduce the amount of pulling he does, which is a good thing."
5,Excellent album !,"Excellent album with our loved Greek singer Nana Mouskouri. She has performed thirteen songs in Spanish coming from Spain, Cuba, Mexico, Argentine and Brazil with her beautiful and unique voice.Don't miss it if you are a true fan, because this is the original album. Nevertheless you will find the same songs edited in some other compilations."
3,Disjointed...,"One of The Catherine Wheel's great strengths is their general ability to offer albums' of consistency--CW weaves solid thematic and sonic textures that flow through albums such as ""Chrome"" and the incredible ""Adam and Eve"". With that, ""Wishville"" feels slightly disjointed, not sure of what it wants to be. If you're looking for hints of ""Ferment"" or ""Chrome"", this may not be the place. The best songs, ""Mad Dog"", ""All of That"", ""Gasoline"" are fantastic, but not really strong enough to carry the album. And even if this is their weakest album to date, it's still head and shoulders better than most bands on their best day."
2,What a disappointment,"In my mind, ""Ferment"" is this band's masterpiece and Wishville does nothing to further their legacy. I've listened to these tracks several times, trying to pluck something noteworthy from a bunch of truly uninspiring songs. Only ""Mad Dog"" caught my interest, and that's not saying much. Maybe they should hang it up and move on.Avoid this one unless you are a diehard fan."
3,Review from HustleBear.com by Judd Weiss,"""Wishville"" is Catherine Wheel's last album before they broke up. They tried to reinvent their sound again, and bring the rock back, but it doesn't really work this time. The album has its moments, but it didn't live up to its predecessor ""Adam and Eve"", most of it feels like something's a little off. ""Gasoline"" is the coolest song on here."
3,Their most commercial,"I've become a large fan of CW, and ""Wishville"" is their most commercial sounding effort. Don't get me wrong, there's nothing entirely wrong with that. Anything success that comes to Rob and the gang would be welcome if it turns people on to their masterpieces ""Ferment"" and ""Adam & Eve."" But, with each listen, ""Wishville"" grows on me, especially the lead single 'Sparks Are Gonna Fly,' and 'All of That.' It might not be CW, but it is still head and shoulders above much of today's rock music."
4,better than 95% of what's in your CD player,"there it was, 1991. i heard black metalic for the fist time and i melted into the soundscape that is the catherine wheel. cruising in a car wasn't good enough for the record because the mellower moments couldn't be audible with out blowing your ear drums on the loud parts. god bless this band, they take dynamics are taken to the max. wishville combines the catherine wheel's major strength (dynamics) and combines it with pure pop sensibility. they've nearly perfected that which is the catherine wheel."
2,(two and a half stars) Boring,"Catherine Wheel inexplicably added ""The"" to its name, and the original bassist (Dave Hawes) left the band. I get the feeling that ""Wishville"" was completely dominated by Rob Dickinson, who I notice put out a solo album recently, which is not a good sign that CW is still around. Anyway, CW's last album ""Wishville,"" (released five years ago!) provides no thrills. Let's face it - after ""Ferment"" and ""Chrome"" the band started on a precipitous slide, ending up on the bottom with the tepid ""Wishville.""For my money, there are four decent songs on the album (each of which are blown away by almost all of ""Ferment,"" and most of ""Chrome"") namely ""Sparks Are Gonna Fly,"" ""Gasoline,"" ""Lifeline,"" and ""Mad Dog."" All of the rest are forgettable throw-aways. Hey Rob! This isn't a good way to end! Get the band back together, and write some music comparable to the old stuff!"
2,pass on this one,"I'll be brief - I absolutely love CHROME and HAPPY DAYS, but when I heard WISHVILLE at a CD listening station I found it uninspiring. Their hearts just don't seem into the music and the result isn't too engaging or interesting. I will concede that a CD can grow on you upon repeated listenings, but I still don't expect I'll be giving it another try."
1,Arrrgggghhhhh..... What happened to these guys?,"For so long did Catherine Wheel carry the torch oh so well for underground guitar music (OK, OK ... alternative rock). Not just with every new CD but with every new song came something different, something unexpected and most importantly; Catherine Wheel always had a sound of their own. Now it appears that CW are trying as hard as they possibly can to appeal to the mainstream masses by releasing an album containing one uninspiring guitar song after the next.To think that this was the band that use to bring us classics so perfect and so beautiful as ""Heal"", ""Delicious"", ""The Nude"", ""Texture"", etc., etc...... Only the anthemic ""Gasoline"" comes anywhere close. Don't get me wrong, Catherine Wheel are one of the most overlooked bands of the 90's but if you really want to hear the true Catherine Wheel, toss this and check out Ferment, Chrome or Happy Days."
2,"""Wishville"" doesn't live up to expectations.","I have to disagree with most of the reviews on here about ""Wishville."" This album is really not very good, especially considering how talented the band is and how amazing their previous five albums are. First off, the album is too short...only nine songs. Second, not a single song is very catchy or remarkable. None of them would certainly have made the cut for the band's previous two studio albums of new material. Buy this if you're a fan, but if you're new to the band, pick up the excellent, rocking ""Happy Days"" (my personal favorite) or the excellent ""Adam & Eve,"" which showcases all sides of the band better than any of their other albums."
1,skip it,"Don't waste your time with Wishville...your time and money is better spent on Ferment and Chrome, and even the B-sides Like Cats and Dogs...and if you can find it, the Show Me Mary single with the tune ""Smother"" on it...amazing."
2,Lacking the strength and imagination of the past.....,"First of all, I would like to say that I am a huge Catherine Wheel fan, and appreciate Catherine Wheel's music for its sincerity, emotion, and dynamics. However, Wishville shows that Catherine Wheel's ideas appear to be running slighty thin. The atmospheric rock of Chrome, the hard edge of Happy Days, and the cohesiveness of Adam and Eve are nowhere to be found here. Instead, there are just 9 songs, almost all of which go along at a sleep-inducing pace. Overall, I was extremely disappointed with this effort, primarily because there is no other band out there like Catherine Wheel, and for this very fact, I was expecting a lot better."
5,If you're looking to know The Catherine Wheel,"then this is your album of choice. A distilled, concise offering of what The Catherine Wheel are known for - emotive melodies, entrancing rhythms, and infectious lyrics. WISHVILLE is at a level that so many bands aspire to, not to mention an incredible production and mixing job which you've got to hear to believe! After cutting your teeth here, though, be sure to undergo other Catherine Wheel treatments, since each album is a completely independant, yet equally inspiring, piece of artwork."
2,"Et tu, Catherine Wheel?","How did a band that produced such a magnificent cd like ""Chrome"" or such a sublime song like ""Black Metallic"", suddenly start to sound like Bush (and, trust me, this is not meant as a compliment)? Despite this very uninspired power-chord-laden ""Wishville"" effort, I urge you to explore the ""older"" works of this amazing band and see how brilliant they can be."
2,Not at their best,"Not much to add to the other reviews except to agree that it is by no means their best album. Not wishing to offend anyone, it seems to me that their sound is becoming more american - I suppose your environment influences you as a writer/composer and as the band have made the USA their home it was bound to happen. I just feel like that they've lost an edge that Chrome and Happy Days had, but I've still got them to listen too and as as with many of their albums I guess it'll grow on me as I didn't like Chrome to begin with - and eventually I had to replace the vinyl as I'd worn it out so there you go. Still a fan."
1,An Absolute Waste,"This album is an absolute disaster. There is only a modicum of worthwhile talent displayed on this album. This album is so far removed from their former glory days that you have to ask what happened? Anyone remotely interested in ""The"" Catherine Wheel would do well to look to prior albums. this one is a complete waste."
1,Terrible ending for a great band.,"their last album, released in 2000 on columbia, is simply terrible. i know there are people that like it, but to me it sounds like a collection of b-sides from collective soul and better than ezra. crummy songwriting, their bassplayer leaving, & boring riffs = crappy album. coming after the career (and 90s) peak of 'adam and eve,' this sounds doubly worse. a sad swan song for one of the best bands of the 90s."
2,Notes,"I didn't get too much out of this book. I imagine if someone was just looking for dates that does not require details, it would be okay."
5,Excellent Case!,Excellent case. My 9mm Beretta 92FS fits perfectly in the case. Has a place to put your own lock for security during transportation. Highly recommend it!
3,Plano Gun Case,"Well, it's a case. It does not come with any lock(s). Case can be easily broken into, but will detour kids from breaking in. Teenagers different story. Great for transportation. But if you're looking for security, get a safe.I'm not complaining about the product, for I simply need a case to transport my glock."
3,gun case,I bought this to take my pistol on a flight and the guy that checks in the firearms said it would be easy to break into and that we should drill additional holes in it for a second lock for security purposes.Otherwise I was pleased with the way my ruger sr9 fit in the case/molding.
4,Good for my first pistol,"A decent priced case for my first gun. Easily fit a 9mm Sig, along with a mag and 2x50 round boxes. Wasn't looking for anything fancy, and it delivered just what I was looking for."
4,Nice Sturdy Inexpensive Gun Case,"A very nice and sturdy plastic gun case. Great for transporting your gun to and from the range. I bought this for a Glock 9mm. It has plenty of room for that. Foam lining keeps things from moving around. I can fit this case into my gear bag with my ear protection, glasses, and extras. Very well priced and practical."
4,Very Good Handgun case for the price.,"I was able to fit my Bersa .40 along with 3 magazines comfortably in this case. It took a couple of bumps and one quick drop with no damage to the case. I do have to note that because of the low price of this case something had to be sacrificed. After using this case about a dozen times I noticed that the lid alignments were off some, although with a quick jerk that issue is fixed. Also, the glue used for the foam was not top brand glue, but that also is not a big issue as I sometimes cut into and use the thick sides of the foam to store a mini cleaning kit. So the same issue of lid alignment and foam regluing you can get in flimsy gun cases (any case of less than a $50 value) was not avoided here, but you get what you pay for. All in all, if you are not going to invest a larger amount of money in a high quality handgun case, then this is the best pick of the cheap cases hands down so I'll give it 4 stars based on quality vs price."
5,Fits 2 guns easy,I got this case for my Taurus pt92 afs. This case not only fits my Taurus but it fits my GLOCK 22 as well.Price is reasonable for this case. I will get one more in near future.
4,Good Enough for one,The case is quite good for taking my primary weapon & two mags to the range and in fact I bought two cases one for me and one for a friend.
4,good value,Can't beat it for the money.Roughly about the same quality of a Plano tackle box. good for lower to mid-priced guns.
4,Plano Single Pistol Case,Seems to be OK for what you pay. Nice for storing your guns if you don't have a gun safe or a dedicated pistol rack.
3,You get what you pay for,"Might be worth the $8.99 I paid for it but not any more than that. Like I say, you get what you pay for."
4,It suits certain purposes.,I purchased this to carry my full size 9mm pistol when I go to the range. It fits that roll perfectly. The pistol and three clips fit in the case snuggly.I docked a star because I have purchased the same case through a local store and was using it to store an old .22lr pistol. It had sat in the case for two weeks and when I went to use the pistol it had completely rusted.This case is fantastic and durable enough to transport your pistol in but I would look for a case that seals if you plan to store a fire arm. Also desiccants are a fantastic investment.
5,Perfect size for large revolver,"I wasn't sure when I ordered this if it would be big enough, but it's the perfect size to carry my DW 357 Revolver and a few auto load cartridges. Very sturdy and lots of padding inside to keep everything secure!"
5,For the money it does the job!,Can't beat this for the money! Does exactly what it is supposed to do. I would buy it again!
4,Good Storage Case,"This has solid construction and snugly holds all contents. This should however only be used as a simple storage case and should not contain any ammo. As the construction of the case and placement of its lock loop allows quite easy access to the weapon regardless of which direction you store it. So this should not be a storage alternative for home defense or loaded firearms, but also is the absolute poorest construction and security to use as a travel case to check a weapon in with while traveling.This is not for people with kids! I promise you a child CAN get into this with a lock on it. The lock loop to me seems more of a formality and aesthetic general requirement more than an actual safeguard to protect the case's contents. Do not count on it's safety!"
5,good case,my order came in today.The case can hold my p-11 9mm luger and 2 extra clips.The case fits good under my truck seat.The padding in the case is thick enough where my 9mm and the clips dosent move around.You can also lock the case.If I buy any more cases I will still get Plano cases.
2,"Good case, cheap foam insert","This case is strongly made and closes well. However, the included foam inserts are very cheap and offer no support. After carefully making cut-outs for my XD-9, I found that the foam was too feeble to support the gun properly and just looked cheap and saggy.After a difficult search on the web, I discovered another case maker, Pelican (on ebay), that sold replacement foam inserts, which I ordered. I found these to be of far better quality and well support the gun and accessories.In the end, it would have been cheaper and easier to have just bought the case from Pelican in the first place.To be honest, even the Pelican foam is not as good as the foam I used to use in the UK to carry heavy cameras in alluminum cases. That foam had a velvet surface and was extremely firm, but God only knows where to buy that!"
3,great box for for the $.,It's a great case for the money . It's slim light weight designed is great for traveling. I own the next size up too which is big enough for two hand guns.
3,Good not great,"First of all this is not a bad case. But you get what you pay for, and you don't pay a lot for this case. It gets the job done and it's very light. Great for Airsoft pistols. Note: The case I got was not ""pillared"". Didn't matter to me but just beware."
3,Single Pistol Case,this product is ok. my biggest problem with it is that it is too flimsy to my liking. i would say its twice as thick as a gallon of milk. (just estimating). but its cheap so what could some one expect. besides it being flimsy i would have to say it does look nice and that it does it intended job. i put in it a 9mm beretta with enough room for two maybe even three magizines.
5,Perfect for .357 Pellet Gun.,"For me, this is a 4-star item made better than that based on its price & my use for it. I bought this for my Crosman .357 pellet pistol. It fits perfectly and leaves ample room for 5-6 reload clips and a couple of CO2 cartridges. Construction is lightweight but sturdy; fine for my needs. I would NOT use it for secure storage of a standard firearm as it can be too easily compromised by a child, even with a lock. If you are looking for serious handgun storage, this is not it. For pellet handgun storage, though, it is an excellent and inexpensive solution; highly recommended for this use."
3,single pistol case,It was necessary to return this product since it was not the model I hoped to receive. I searched for a particuar item by model number and received the single pistol case which was a different model number and half the size.When I ordered the case it was impossible to determine from the picture whether it was the right model.I ultimately returned the case and purchased another case from a local sporting goods store.
2,Well... its a case,"It protects whats inside quite well with foam, and is a rather solid case, that is why I did not give 1 star.Unfortunately, with both ends locked, you can still pry the front of the case open quite easily with just your hands, and get a full size pistol out of the case effortlessly. Maybe if the locks were closer to the corners or handle. I guess if I want this to work I'll have to buy a 3rd lock to put around the handle. I'll just get a new case..."
3,It gets the job done,This is a cheap case that gets the job done. I have my .45 HK with clips in it.Spend another $20 and buy a Pelican case.
5,"Perfect For ""Judge""","This small simple inexpensive case is perfect for my ""Judge"" pistol. It would also work very well for a ""Baby Glock"""
4,Excellent for revolver storage,You can't beat this for the price for storing a handgun. I keep a S&W 357 magnum and 3 speedloaders in the case. Quality is good overal plastic. The latches work fine and appear to be decent for plastic.
3,Case is fine dimensions listed are wrong.,"The case construction is fine and is good quality. But be careful if you are buying because of the listed dimensions. The the main reason I bought this is to store it in a safe. The dimensions listed (11.5"" L X 7.5"" W X 2.75"" H) must be for the inside of the case. A sticker on the front of the box state 13,8.75,3 which screwed up my plans. Too bad because I like the case."
3,Smaller then it looks,Not recommended for larger hand guns. Works well for conceal size guns but that is about it. A bit flimsy in quality but fine to protect and cary your smaller gun to the range or keep in the car.
5,Excellent gun case,"The Plano pistol case is well made, has foam inserts, and the 2 fasteners work fine to keep the case closed even with rough handling. I would buy it again."
5,Good,"Simple, cheap, does what it's supposed to. Decent quality. Fits a full size handgun and magazine with room to spare."
4,As valid today as when written,"All Helen MacInnes' adventure/spy novels are as well written as anything LeCarre wrote, but more than that, were based on facts. Her husband was a member of England's MI5, Intelligence, which contributed to her knowledge of the doings of Soviet's Smersh and the implements of death developed in Dept 13. One member of my family thought Smersh was a fiction, was astonished when she learned it actually existed! This particular novel was one of MacInnes' first and the premise on which it is based, is just as true today as when written -- 2 and 2 are still four, neither 5 nor 3 -- as political spinners would have us believe -- never more true than when selling the public on a candidate for office!"
1,Shockingly bad,"This is the kind of ambitious undertaking that should have been done by someone with deep expertise in the field and *then* checked by specialists in each of the dialects, or written by a team of experts. Unfortunately, it seems to have been written by one person and then not checked by anyone. It's full of bizarre claims and errors; if you speak or specialize in one of the dialects of English that is not shared by the author, you're sure to find a host of linguistic (and sociolinguistic) errors and errors of omission. That is, he states things that just aren't true, and he doesn't mention critical information. Look for another book on the topic--don't get this one."
3,Reasonable product which is hard to find where I live,"Many experts believe the most common/cheaper form of magnesium found in drugstores, markets, etc. which is Magnesium Oxide is a real waste. This is due to poor bioavailability. Hence my quest to find Magnesium Citrate or another form of magnesium which has superior absorption. There are several choices which I want to research further. I know Bluebonnet makes a great Magnesium Citrate- at least it works very well for me. Like anything else, we're all different & your mileage may vary. I absolutely like the fact these are in soft gel form and always go that route with supplements unless unavailable.. then my next choice is liquid.. even though I've found a few that are impossible to swallow if your gag reflexes are sensitive to bad taste and smell. Personally I had better results with Bluebonnet, but they're also pricier. If you're looking to save a few bucks, this one might be a good choice."
5,Love this magnesium product,"I have been taking this product for several years now for IBS, helps for regularity and my bone density test was excellent. Taking 2 pills/day, one morning, one evening works great for me."
2,Good price but...,"The price is good, the delivery service is good but the product should really be in capsule. The tablets are much too big to swallow and you have to take about 6 a day to feel the benefits. I have resorted to melting them in cool beverages, but image the taste!!!"
1,?,I have been taking other brands of Magnesium and they work pretty good. This one stinks. Doesnt do a thing for me. Would request a refund but takes to long.
5,Magnesium Citrate,"Don't expect a miracle, but it helped a little bit, which is all I can ask. Give it a try it may help you too."
4,CITRATE FORM IS BEST FOR SOME - NOT FOR OTHERS,"In my experience with this ""NOW"" Magnesium Citrate, I have found that if you have any form of inflamatory bowel disease, a little too much of this stuff [amount varies for the individual] will give you a very loose stool. While it is still best absorbed by people with Ulcerative Colitis and Crohns compared to other magnesium forms, small doses are indicated, or else you will be staying very near the restroom. That having been said this is the best magnesium product for most people and you get alot for a reasonable price.On the other hand, people with chronic constipation get nothing but good from this product as it makes them very regular very fast.If you need Magnesium in the Citrate form, this ""NOW"" product is an excellent and reasonably priced choice.While we are still pleased with this product my husband no longer plans to continue using it having Crohns, though I will still be taking it, having enjoyed excellent results for over a year."
4,Good Value,It was much cheaper than what I was buying from my chiropractor. It seems to be working fine. I will purchase again.
3,Seems to work,"I bought this vitamin supplement based on what I read. Buying it on Amazon was cheaper than buying it at the Vitamin Shoppe near my home. Since I have nothing to compare this to, and since it doesn't have any negative response on my body, I'm happy with my purchase."
5,Adventurers shrink the world,"It's a wonder of the human spirit that people can go through the things that true adventurers do and want to do them again. We are lucky that so many of them manage to write about their adventures so well, and Wilfred Thesiger is one of the best. It's inspiring in a world of such violence, nationalism, and tribal wars to read the stories of those who have travelled to utterly foreign places and found themselves to be at home."
5,A great trip,"What can I say that hasn't been said by others here? This is a terrific read, detailing Mr. Thesiger's trips through one of the most notoriously desolate places on Earth. It's a great adventure and one that should have killed him. Remarkably, the combined forces of heat, dehydration, bandits, hostile imans, hostile tribes, snakes, quicksand, starvation, and King Ibn Saud himself didn't manage to do it. Fortunetely for us, we're left with a wonderful, illuminating account of the Bedu people and their landscape - that while harsh and hostile - begins to take on an intoxicating beauty when seen through Mr. Thesiger's eyes.You'll be glad you read this one."
3,Not for me,"I give it 3 stars for being interesting, for being exotic enough to draw me in for 100 pages, and for the author's clear descriptive writing. It would get more stars if it had developed any kind of a plot in those 100 pages -- I did not go further.I did, though, learn how to make a camel lower it's milk. That little lesson alone was worth the time (I won't be doing THAT any time soon... I won't say how this feat is accomplished, but let me say that a Bedu who does this must want that milk badly).Really, it is like a travelog in that it takes you along with him on desert journeys. Not too much adventure here, though, in the first 100 pp."
1,Amazon sends torn book,"This is the second torn book I have received from Amazon. Both books were brand new and in excellent condition EXCEPT for a razor-cut through the first 50 or so pages, including the cover. I am becoming increasingly worried about Amazon's quality control. I know I could send the book back, but the truth is, they should get it right the first time."
4,Dancing Sheik To Sheik,"I like this book very much, but the style was very dry so I had to drink a lot of Hawaiian Punch to get through it.Often it made me very nervous, so I smoked a lot of Camels.I think after reading it I will be a more interesting person and maybe get a lot of dates.Thank you for your encouragement."
4,Good book,Good Book. Easy reading. I learned thinkg I never knew about the public broadcasting industry that I needed to learn for a paper I was writing. interesting.
4,Great example of its genre,"Calumet K is one of many books that I classify as ""hero novels"", books that could be termed Hortio ALger for adults.This short book is the story of one man's adventure in building one of the largest grain elevator's in the world. If you are an engineer or interested in the history of structures in the US this is a must read.Put this on your shelf next to ""Banker and Bear"", ""Cash McCall"", and ""The Fountainhead"".-RS"
2,"Ayn Rand's favorite book, and a real crapfest!","God knows I love Ayn Rand for the honesty and precision of her intellect, but she sure was a weirdo! This dull, uninspiring tripe about a man trying to get a grain silo built was her favorite book of all time! The only reason this book still exists in print is that her slavish devotees mimic her opinions and tastes to the letter."
4,Excellent as a drama on the lives of prostitutes but only fair as a thriller,"Intelligent if slightly awkward melding of a gritty, sad drama of life of the street for working classprostitutes in the UK, and a somewhat more melodramatic and soapy (if sometimes quite tense)serial killer thriller.Unlike `Klute' where the world of hustling and thriller melded seamlessly, here there is a bit moreschizophrenia between the elements. For me, the crime sections, while sometimes effective, werealso quite familiar, and felt like TV and movies I'd seen many times before, whereas the portrait ofthe day to day lives of hustlers felt like much more interesting and less often explored in anon-exploitive way. The killings and investigation feel oddly grafted on."
5,Fabulous!,I baked the caramel oatmeal bars last week. They are delicious and everyone wanted the recipe! Each recipe that I have cooked from Texas Ties has been tasty. I highly recommend Texas Ties cookbook for your dining pleasure!!
2,Did Not Last Long,"Very educational - 3 year old daughter loved it. Unfortunately, it did not last. We purchased this in November 2005 & by September 2006 it no longer works. We're unable to return it (obviously) and the manufacturer provided no useful return policy. Oh well, fun while it lasted!"
1,DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!,"My mother bought my three sons a v-smile console for Christmas last year and as Grandmas do, went overboard buying every single game she could find. She also purchased extra controllers, charger, adapter, you name it. This toy began powering itself off after the second or third use and never came back on. Exchanged it for a new one that did the same thing. Exchanged THAT for a v-smile pocket hoping for better luck and THAT did the same thing after about 5 uses! It also would not release the cartridges! Wrote to v-tech and was continually insulted and patronized by their associates, never been so upset with any company in my life! I have done research into this and found many other parents say the same! Look this up, you will find it! V-tech told me to keep the games and the unit cleaner, now I ask how dirty it could be after a couple of uses? Complete waste of a lot of Grandma's money and three heartbroken kids! I do not recommend!"
4,Great for my needs,"I wanted a device that could give me the web browsing capabilities and mp3 player without the price and weight of a laptop. This fits the requirements well. It requires some tinkering to get things just right. If you don't want to tinker, get an iPod touch. Otherwise this is great."
4,Very good portable tablet for the office and road.,"Being Linux-based and well-designed, this little ""internet tablet"" provides good value for someone seeking a portable wireless network appliance. You can check email, browse the web in a small but readable screen, and find a few free applications on the Maemo websites. This is definitely not a robust small PC, but for limited application usage, particularly network- and web-based functions, I find this Nokia quite useful. I brought it to Europe with me for email and web browsing on wireless networks. The only flaw I've found with it is that its wireless reception is a bit weaker than typical notebooks, so you must be relatively closer to the router. This may have improved with the latest firmware update, although I haven't tested it yet. And, by the way, it now is Skype-compatible."
4,"Cool gadget, but first one was defective","I got my new Nokia N800 and was pleasantly surprised by the thinness and light weight. Unfortunately it had what I think is a screen defect that caused the right-most 3/4"" of screen to not be as bright as the rest. I'm returning it for a replacement and hope the new one doesn't show the same problem.As for the workings, it was relatively easy to use right out of the box. There's no printed manual, but you can download a PDF from the Nokia website, or there's one on the device itself, if you can figure out how to find it.Update: The replacement has arrived showing the same darkened area of screen as the first. Since writing my original review, I've seen other reviews online describing the same problem. Yet I've also seen photographs of devices apparently free of the problem. Perhaps the batch Amazon currently has are all bad."
2,defective screen as described by previous owners,The good:* Ordered last Saturday and received it today(the following Monday) for standard ground shipping* Wireless connection is very smooth.* Most websites are displayed properlyThe bad:* The right side of the screen display is distorted and darkened. Several previous owners had complained similar problems.* Youtube playing is chokey* Does not support google docs* Does not support Chinese* Sharp edges of the stylus is not comfortable to users.I am returning it to get a replacement..... somewhat disappointed with the quality control of Nokia.
4,As great as expected. Highly recommended,"I just got mine from Amazon, and the first thing I did was to update to OS2008. Quite a breeze even for a pc novice. Maybe not. Having read a lot about the its pluses, I have to say I agree with most the parts, and indeed it is a phenomenal smart device. Go get one if you've been deiding.Nice job, Nokia! You just won another first-time consumer."
3,Good but with not as described,"The Nokia N800 does what it says except for the Bluetooth feature. Nokia has confirmed the Bluetooth feature will only work with select Nokia Bluetooth capabile phones.Even though my current cell phone is Bluetooth capabile, the Nokia N880 would not connect. Because of this I returned the unit to Amazon."
3,"Good, but...","Nokia made a good attempt, but needs to try a bit harder.First, the good:-Small and light-Gorgeous screen-Great battery life-Wireless connections just work -- no fiddling aroundNow, the less-than-good:-No keyboard (I know -- get the 810. But it's $200 more, and the keyboard is all that I want from the 810)-The OS seems as though it was created for a bigger screen. Especially in OS2008, the menus and fonts are HUGE, taking up a lot of screen space and necessitating a lot of scrolling.-This is not a PIM. No attempt was made to even try to make it one, although you can hack up a fair facsimile.-It's a bit slow: start-up time is incredibly long (almost as long as my desktop PC), and it's not as responsive as I'd like it to be.Bottom line: If you're looking for a web browser/book reader/note taker that is small, reasonably quick, and hackable, then this is the gizmo for you."
2,Akward,"Sent it back for a refund. Very akward, too small to read, does not work well with my blackberry."
4,N800,"The N800 it is very complete, the only thing that it doesn't do is making calls, besides that, 5 stars"
4,Impressive,"Straight out of the box, the Nokia N800 seemed to have rather limited functions. But after upgrading to OS2008, installing some neat software (e.g. Maemopad, Screengrabber, GPE calendar, etc.), and launching the FM radio, the N800 is now a nifty little multi-tasker. Very impressed by it. Syncing it with Google calendar will be the next step for me... I'm sure there is some software out there that will allow me to do so. Hunting for appropriate software and installing and launching them can be a bit tedious (hence the four star)."
4,N800 Tablet review,This is a great little device for travlers to access the internet.. better than carrying a laptop... Look you don't even have to pull it out of its protective cover/out of your bag during airport screening..Bad side of it.. The internet browser isn't fully functional.. Example..the software needs Java Enable.. a lot of programs on the internet use this to access certain sites... Nokia.. please get your programmers on this... you will make alot more sales..
3,"Great product, but screen's too small.","Everything works great on this laptop substitute, except the screen is too small. It's bigger than a cell phone's, but I'd use it every day if it was 3x bigger. The zoom feature is just too cumbersome."
2,Wasted Potential: Major HW or Firmware Flaw,"The Nokia is a cool looking device with interesting software and UI; though I kept wishing that it had a keyboard. I also had trouble using a BT phone for networking (even though I know the phone I used supports networking). My biggest complaint is that I can't turn on this device on unless I first plug it into a charger. If I'm not near a charger or plug, the device is a brick. The problem continued even after I updated it to the latest firmware. That's a huge quality flaw that's really unacceptable for a mobile device. Enter ""N800 won't power on"" into a search engine to find that this is a common problem and Nokia hasn't been doing much of anything to address it."
1,Connectivity Problems = [...],"I really wanted to like this. Its Flash and Opera browser allow me to log onto sites like my bank account and watch vids like on YouTube that I simply cannot do on my Windows Mobile 5 phone. I love the ability to stream Rhapsody , the maipulation of web pages (full screen and zoom) plus the handling of pdfs. BUT I can only enjoy these perks...at HOME where it connects to my wi-fi service. Outside of home it just will not conect to anything, nothing.It will not use my cell phone's modem successfully (HTC 8525/AT&T; network), and it connects to open wi-fi networks but when I try to go open a web page, it gives me a network connection error (red dot that turns green remains red).So basically, it's a tease to me. I love the idea of traveling with this instead of popping open my [...] Mac, especially in certain places. But due to it's lack of ability to connect and no maemo (very un-user friendly) solutions, it's plain useless. I plan to return it."
