3,Traveler,"I travel a lot and needed a new battery operated shaver to do a quick job for my legs. Even though it's not as nice as a Venus razor which gets taken away every time I board a plane, it still does the job."
2,missing dvd,"I believe that I am missing a part of the civiv game. It is my understanding that I am supposed to have two discs, I only have one. I wrote a note earlier and as yet have recieved no reply. Can you help?"
4,Love my Packers,"purchased this item around Christmas time as a gift to myself. I think it's a bit large for me. perhaps it was made for a male, but love it anyway. didnt think about it being white at the time. now i don't want to wear it so it doesnt get dirty."
2,Frustrating,"I bought this set because I thought that the cassette tapes would provide a way to study while driving in the car. This did not work out. Too much content had to be learned before even one side of one tape could be understood. The content progressed at a very rapid pace and the introduction of new material was not well organized. The biggest problem with the book was the size of the Hebrew text. A magnifying glass is an essential tool to read the text. After a while, though, reading through the magnifying glass gave me a headache."
5,"Gifted Education Press Quarterly, Volume 11, Number 4","This book is a comprehensive resource for parents written by one of the best researchers in the gifted education field. Rogers gives parents detailed information on understanding giftedness and many important topics including subject-based acceleration, grade-based acceleration, program provisions, out-of-school provisions and developing the child's educational plan. The book also contains checklists parents can use to identify gifted children's learning potential and strengths, and their interests in reading/language, mathematics, science, social studies, and the arts. Each chapter has a clear discussion based on current research. In addition, informative tables and relevant accounts of particular gifted children highlight the topics being discussed. We highly recommend Rogers' book for both parents and teachers who are seeking a comprehensive resource for selecting the best possible education for their gifted children or students."
2,weighty,"overall, not helpfull.There are some interesting tools in the addendum, the author gets pretty weighty with them however.The most usefull point, parents will probably have to create their own learning plan and Rogers shares some examples of those."
3,Swans Reach by Margaret Way,"From back cover:Rachael was heartbroken at having to leaver her lovely old home, Swan's Reach. She would probably have hated anyone who bought it, but she felt an extra antipathy to Dominic Retford, with his air of being monarch of all he surveyed-and the dreadful woman, Vanessa Maybury, who was going to marry him."
2,Definitely worthy of a more decent DVD edition,"This is a very nice and underrated Hill/Spencer movie.Definiely worth seeing as an early childhod memory.What's more,there is considerably more to it than the average Trinity fist/fight thing.Clever plot and dialogues as well as tropical atmosphere.But the sad part is that this DVD edition is lousy VHS transfer and does not include the original aspect ratio.This seems to be ancient history for almost every Hill/Spencer US title.You know the rest:the original Italian DVD is widescreen and of superior video quality but not English friendly as usual.The choice is yours,but this lousy edition is pricey as well(if you only check the price in some ebay listings...)"
4,Two Missionaries,"Not quite as good as some of their other spoofs, but nonetheless an essential addition to the Trinity collection. This movie, with a tropical island twist, runs along similar lines. Good Trinity, bad Bambino, and very corrupt island hierarchy which must be dealt with by the spoofy and slapstick hands of these brothers. To be expected from these two, not much in the way of priestly advice/sermons, but more good tough guys vs. very bad rough guys. Acting as usual tends to be a little lacking, but these movies aren't academy material, just good, wholesome, coach potato snorting slapstick. Recommend."
1,This is a joke,"This is a bad transfer from VHS to DVD, spruced up with a nice looking label. There has been no rerendering whatsoever. The quality of this DVD is so bad one can't even look at it without throwing up."
5,For home or school. This is great!,"The Phonics Handbook is the core of the Jolly Phonics program. The program is very organized, systematic, and fun for kids. Jolly Phonics was developed by a teacher in England and its use has spread to other English-speaking countries. It was part of several studies that demonstrated its incredible effectiveness, including, I believe the Clackmannanshire study (google that for convincing reason to teach your children via phonics). The teacher or parent starts by teaching the child 5 sounds and their corresponding letters. Within a week or two the child learns to blend those sounds together when reading words! All 44 English sounds (phonemes) are covered, along with their most common spellings. Writing is included, because spelling and reading go hand-in-hand. Highly recommended, as are Jolly Phonics' other resources."
4,The Phonics Handbook: In Print Letters (Jolly Phonics) (Purchased on 07/08/2011),Hi!Good book. Teachers can make their classes interesting by using the tips and other activities to make children have a great time learning phonics.
2,Jolly Phonics Handbook,"The book was a good price and came quickly, but it smelled old and musty. I am trying to air it out. It really stinks."
5,yum.,tastes great and you don't have to use a whole lot to get the flavor. i'd buy this product again.
5,Tastes awesome!,"So, FedEx ""couldn't locate"" my address the first time and returned the item back to the seller. They were nice enough to resend it to me without charge. Syrup is awesome! I made a ton of drinks with it at the parties and used it to just add into the drinking water for flavor."
4,Amazing,"I saw these kids live in Kansas City and will buy all of their CDs. These performers are amazing. They are great musicians and singers without regard to their age. I personally liked their first two CDs better because it was more traditional Celtic music, but this CD is still very good. The selection of song writers was surprising, including Tom Waits, but their choices of songs fit them very well."
2,Please tape up the area around the clips on the doors!,"My daughter picked out this cage for her 2 dwarf hamsters. The second night she had them, one of the hamsters managed to get her head between the bars by the clip on the door. Although the bars in most of the cage are close enough together to be safe, there is a space beside the clip on each of the doors where a dwarf hamster can get her head out. The hamster died. We have since taped up the area around the clip to prevent the second hamster from doing the same. The other hamster seems to be enjoying the cage, but she misses her sister! (Also the wheel is very noisy-- you'll want to buy the Silent Spinner or other quieter wheel.)"
2,Not sure this is actually new,"This item took longer than expected to arrive, and when it finally did i was extremely disappointed in the contents. the wire cage and base itself are fine. The wheel and ladder are not as they appear in the picture. The house was broken and covered in some kind of black film that i can't scrub off. There are no directions only pictures! The wheel seems to have pretty sharp edges and so does the house. I'm going to request replacement parts and hope for the best i suppose. Overall i thought this was a deal for the cost, but it turns out its worth exactly what you pay, which is not much."
5,A pleasantly addicting book,"I found myself with little spare time during the days that I read ""Memory Reload."" Rosemary Heim gives a great perspective on the characters and how they react to surprising facts from the mysterious past of AJ. This story is sure to keep the reader hooked on discovering answers to the unexpected events that keep piling up. I enjoyed Heim's smooth and enjoyable writing style, and I'm definitely looking forward to the next book from this exciting new author!"
3,Lots of info for craftmakers but lacking historical info,If you want to make a buckskin hat or a horn gun powder flask then this book is for you..If you want to know how to USE a hatchet or how to build a lean to..This book is not for you....Has a good pemmican recipe though....I was expecting more historical refernces I guess....
4,Kind of disappointed,"I was somewhat disappointed in the book Mountainman Crafts and Skills,because I already knew most of the material that they covered. Although I think that the book would be great for someone just starting out learning these skills. It was a refresher course for me."
5,Awesome!,This is by far one of my favorite CD's. My favorite song is Con mis manos. It's a very upbeat song and very catchy. All of the songs are great including her hit Malo. Buy this CD! You won't be sorry!
5,Great debut!,"This multiple Latin Grammy award debut CD by Bebe is a fun, flamenco esque collection of passionate songs. Some upbeat, some ballads. If you are a fan of contemporary Spanish music, with a twist, check out Bebe!"
3,Not what I excpected,"I first heard Bebe on the Putumayo Latin Lounge album. I always like to buy the artists' original recordings, but I must say that this one disappointed me a bit. Too electronic and aggressive for me. And some of the songs just keep going on and on and on... No thanks."
5,awesome,"this bebe girl is awesome!!i take her songs a lil bit feminist but its ok, a kind of encouragment for women or they feel identified etc. anyhow lyrics, rythm and voic is awesome, really good, except for one or 2 songs. a great cd! a must have"
4,A detective story with deeper implications,"Schlink creates an interesting character and story, and at the same time interweaves the themes of working through the meaning of the Nazi past in a bourgeois democratic Germany. His characterization -- especially of his detecttive, a former Nazi prosecutor -- is rich, and the German not too difficult for one such as I, who learned German from Pimsleur CDs relatively late in life."
3,"it coulda had class, it coulda been a contender","First of all, if you're a beginner, move along for now. Intermediate guitarists will get the most out of this, while advanced guitarists will yawn. Mainly because this DVD look like it extracted parts of lessons from other Hot Licks videos and tossed them together with no thought to organization or context. Two stars for what looks to me like a cheap attempt to make a lesson DVD without expending any effort and because it's quite short. There is some value to it, so I rated it two stars. I allotted another because of the slow play option to help you break down the samples, and because a small booklet with tab/notation was included. Overall, you might learn a thing or two or even more, but you'll have to abuse your pause button and suffer through lessons taken out of context."
4,Great Item for the price.,"This iron works well for the price. I had a similar iron but a lot more expensive, this iron works just as well for the fraction of the price."
5,csn&y,This was one of my favorite CD's from the past!I wanted a fresh copy.....so there you have it!
2,American Asleep,"Compared to the first CSN album, Deja Vu, and Four Way Street, this is a huge disappointment. CSN needed Neil Young's rougher edge badly at the time and got his softer side, instead. Compass, American Dream, and This Old House are fine songs but the rest are forgettable and, unfortunately, unimportant. I realize that they probably would not hit the peaks they reached with Ohio, Find The Cost Of Freedom, Helpless, etc. Yet, this release barely distinguishes itself from the rest of the recent CSN CDs."
3,"2 great songs, 2 awful ones, and 10 more","There are two great songs on this album, Crosby's ""Compass"" (heartfelt and haunting...despite its dreadfully mixed metaphors) and Young's ""Feel Your Love,"" which is a terribly moving piece of work. There are also two awful songs, Nash's ""Shadowlands"" and ""Soldiers of Peace."" The rest is fair to middling."
2,A Sow's Ear Made by a Silk Purse of a Band,"The critics are right: this is shite, with the exception of Crosby's chilling ""Compass"" -- made all the more eerie by Neil's keening harmonica -- and Neil's great ""Steal Your Love,"" which belonged on a more auspicious album. The rest is bilious, overproduced, forgettable schlock."
2,Such a waste of talent,"Actually I've rarely listened to such a useless record. When I bought it I thought it could be a delusion, but not such a crap!!. I rate it 2 stars because of 1 song, i.e. ""compass"", which is really good, the rest could, and will, be forgotten. Even the grat Neil here doesn't show any particular composing talent, and the arrangements are terrible, why do u need to put sinthesizers on such a record?"
2,"nostalgia de grandes momentos, ausencia de compromiso, y ese sonido ochentoso......","pobre coleccion de canciones, irregular,poco inspirada por momentos...la presencia de NEIL YOUNG, quizas el unico de los cuatro que muestra una constante evolucion, no alcanza a dar brillo a este album... honestamente no hallo motivos para recomendar esta placa, DONT SAY GOODBYE, THIS OLD HOUSE son los puntos mas salientes..encima de todo esta presente ese sonido de organo barato que tan mal le hizo a la musica de la decada del 80..encima eso!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz,"Face it folks. This album is dull, dull, DULL. Fourteen songws with nary an interesting lyric, melody, or compelling arangement to be found. My how far these four have fallen."
4,love it,"I love most songs on it. Bought two. one for myself and one as a gift. Bought it for ""This old house"" I just love that song, but there are other beautiful songs as well, and like on any cd, a couple are not my choice.I Dreamed A DreamOverall, it was well worth purchasing."
2,"Did there really have to be a ""Ballad Of Gary Hart""?","Even if it did turn out to be sort of a post-Monica ""Hail To the Chief"" as accidental prophecy? By this I mean the title track (don't look for it by either of the other ""titles"" I mentioned). The spectacle of Neil boppin' to a Supremes-style beat has only curiosity value, which lasts for only one playing. Then, who cares? Everything in here by Neil is nothing in comparison to what he gives us on his own albums. All of CSN(Y?)'s '90s albums reveal a band afraid of becoming '70s dinosaurs. The problem is, that's what they're best at. They ain't worth diddly as honorary gen-X'ers. I miss the REAL CSN, dammit!"
4,Don't believe the jerks who say it sucks. It's great!!!,"This is a great album recorded by great men and the world certainly DOES need it. What we DON'T need is ignoramus critic Tom Hibbert babbling out his ridiculous, insulting, long winded dissection of it. Anyway, what is so bad about this album that people are looking at it like crap? I just can't figure this out. I have always loved it. Sure, Neil Young's and David Crosby's songs are the best ones here, but Stills and Nash make some contributions that are quite good also, (some better than others). The only songs I find myself skipping over are ""Shadowland"", ""Drivin Thunder"" and ""Soldiers of Peace"". But who cares? The CD is an hour long with 14 songs and there really is a lot of damn good music here. Don't let anybody else tell you otherwise."
1,Don't bother,"This album is, by and large, a useless mess. Neil Young had refused to reunite with CSN until David Crosby got his act together. Clearly this album is evidence that Neil never would have given that condition had he thought Crosby would get clean and sober, and even Mr. Young indulges in his worst tendencies here. Only the modestly pleasant ""Got It Made"" is worth hearing and it, my friends, is NOT worth the price of admission."
2,Dissatisfying,"Actually CSNY didn't make any mistake. It was my mistake that I bought this album ignoring ""Deja Vu"". I have listened to the album may be four to five times. I agree that the standard of the album is definitely higher than many of the so called chart toppers but still it gives me a certain dissatisfaction."
3,CSNY's weakest effort,"This is CSN&Y;'s weakest album. It has a few good songs on it, the best being Still's ""Got It Made"" which recalls their classic style and harmonies. Young's ""American Dream"" is ok, but nowhere near his best work. The rest of it is pretty mediocre. 60's hippies trying to renew their protest movement in the late 80's. It just doesn't work.This CD is only recommended for avid CSNY fans."
5,Great for Data Binding to Object Models,"I'm not sure where that other reviewer got the idea that this book is only for data binding to datasets.One of the best chapters in the book has fifty pages on how to prepare an object model for data-binding, and the rest of the book gives pretty much equal time to binding to objects and to data sets.The object model chapter assumes that an application's domain model will contain the artifacts necessary for data binding. DDD practitioners will consider that to be bad practice, but the principles and procedures taught are easily applied to transport objects used in the UI. So, regardless of one's preferred style of OOP, the book provides good coverage.Having just used the book in building a DDD app with full data binding, I can recommend it without reservation."
4,Warning: C# ...,This is a fine book but would be much better if the code samples were in VB instead of C#. The product description should have said that. The samples are mostly small and can be understood by a VB programmer but on principle I don't buy C# books so was irritated.
4,Just the basics,"Nice teaching strategies. Mainly for the older grades, but some ideas can be watered down so the younger ones could handle them."
4,A reading experience,"This book is more than an academic study. It provides an experience of Kali devotions at the deepest levels. It also presents a variety of perceptions heretofore unavailable in a single volume. An outstanding contribution. Ron Frost, R.N., M.A."
4,"Very nice, but heavy for travelers","I highly recommend this bed for in home use. The fact the pump is detachable is wonderful so young children are not with electrical cords. It is very comfortable, and the edge did keep my son from falling off. However, it is really too heavy to take along in trips."
1,Not durable - 1st one lasted two months; 2nd lasted six months,"Love the mattress, love the ease of blowing it up, nice to have a cover. However, the first one we had lasted two months before a seam busted. Amazon replaced it. The second one lasted six months with another hole somewhere. We used this every day."
3,Convienient for travel but..........,"We bought this item for vacation for our 2 1/2 year old. He did not have a problem adjusting to it, but rolled off alot in the middle of the night, he is a rough sleeper! Also, I had to put air in it every night because it would loose at least 1/2 of the air from the night before, which seems extreme. I think it may have a slow leak in it, but I am not sure! Overall, it inflates and deflates very easily, but I hated needing to keep reflating it, and hearing my son go thump on the floor several times a night!"
1,Didn't work but 2 or 3 times! Slow leak!,"Used this Aerobed only a few 2 or 3 times and now there is a slow leak! I paid too much but thought ok great reviews.. Since I have had it more than the days allowed to return, I am stuck. Unless I want to return it for a partial refund plus pay shipping and handling."
4,The second one,We ordered this bed years ago for our grandson's visits. Needless to say he really gave it a hard workout. So we purchased another for him and any other guests.
5,Perfect Bed for Vacationing with Small Children,My 18 month old daughter used this for two weeks while we were on vacation. It inflates and deflates very quickly. She slept soundly on it and did not roll off once. The included sheet fits perfectly and stays on because of the elastic band that wraps around the bed. My only issue is the carrying bag broke apart. This wasn't a big deal to me since all that mattered was the mattress. I only had to make sure I inflated it while my daughter wasn't around because she was terrified the first time she saw it expand. I am very satisfied with this product.
2,motor burn out,"Purchased this bed in October 2011 in preparation for the grandkids coming in December....unfortunately the first time we blew up the bed the motor burned out and died. Since I had purchased it so early my window of return had passed....lesson learned. Loved the bed, but now I am stuck with an un-inflatable bed that I cannot use again. NEED ANOTHER MOTOR! Can't seem to find one.....Help anyone?"
5,Fantastic Product,"I love this product. We bought it 4 years ago and have used it constantly for my almost 6 year old daughter. It is perfect for travel. It inflates in a matter of seconds and we have never had a leak or tear. We will continue to use it for our 2 year old, but my older daughter could probably still sleep comfortably in it if needed (she is almost 6 and very tall for her age). I highly recommend to anyone who travels with young children!"
4,it's good,I got this for my niece when she comes over on weekends. She sleeps in it and seems to be worth the money.
1,Don't Buy This,"I am a frequent Amazon shopper and never write reviews but I felt obligated to write this one. Don't buy this product. It looks wonderful and has such strong reviews but this is like sleeping on a loud piece of plastic. If your child never moves while sleeping, this is the product for you. If your child turns or moves in any way, the loud plastic noises will wake all of you up. Keep shopping...I'm sure there are better products.By the way, we do have a twin aerobed with the soft/suede top and it is wonderful! I was hoping for something a bit smaller with this one. Would have been perfect if they made it with the suede top. The nice, soft sheet it comes with just doesn't stop the plastic from making noises! Keep looking!"
3,Nice little bed if your child isnt a tosser & turner,"The bed is nice alternative to the regular aerobed because of it's smaller size. However, the lip isn't tall enough to prevent a child that typically moves around while sleeping from rolling off the bed. However, we found that if you are able to wedge it in between two things, such as a hotel bed and a wall, it works pretty well. Mediocre in comfort, but fine for travel."
4,Great extra bed for kids,"The Aero Bed is sturdy, easy to inflate, and comes with a great mattress cover. The sides keep our grandson from rolling out of bed and he loves this bed."
4,"Blow-up bed, easy and quick to use for small children","Very easy, quick, aerobed for small children for use in traveling or in small spaces."
1,So noisy we can't use it.,Every little movement can be heard rooms away. We own several other AERO beds and this thing is crazy loud. It doesn't matter what you do this thing squeaks (plastic on plastic) all the time. Even on top of another bed or on carpet it makes all kind of noise.
4,"Bigger than a toddler bed, smaller than a twin","My only gripe with the AeroBed for Kids is that there are no sheets to fit it. Toddler bed sheets are too small and twin sheets are too big. The bed does come with a quilted mattress cover, so as long as you don't mind using it as the sheet, you're all set. Other than the sheet issue, the bed is great. My 2.5 year old daughter used it for staying the weekend with her cousins, and she didn't fall out once. She loves having her own travel bed, and she can't wait to use it again. Easy to inflate, deflate, carry, and store."
5,Wonderful product!,This is the second child's aero bed we have purchased. It is wonderful for sleepovers at Grandma's and for hotel stays. It is safe and secure for toddlers too big for portable crib not yet ready for regular bed. Easy and fast to inflate and deflate and store.
4,"Good Toddler travel bed, my 2 yr old slept great!","Good Toddler travel bed, my 2 yr old slept great! Unlike other ones you find online or in stores, this AeroBed is longer and has deeper sides to it. Which as all parents know, with a 2 yr old, they toss and turn all night long. On more than a couple of nights, my little guy was sideways in the bed, but due to the deeper sides of the bed he stayed on the mattress beautifully. The motor that came with it was more than enough to blow the bed up in about 3-6 mins. and was plenty firm. Although, it is a little higher priced than others i found online, i am very happy with this one. i would recommend it to others!"
4,Great comfy travel bed,"We ordered two of these beds for our 2 year old twins for traveling. The bed is portable, inflates and deflates quickly and is a perfect size-- there is room to grow and I'm sure we'll get a few more years out of them. The raised edge is not as high as we expected, but after using the bed, I've concluded that it's high enough to keep a toddler in once asleep. (If your tot is like my twins, they like to jump on the bed and the slight raised edge is no match here! Luckily,the bed seems to be durable enough to withstand their bed flops) The soft fabric cover it comes with is a really nice touch. And we found these beds did not have that overpowering ""plastic"" smell that some inflatable beds have. The best part is that the beds inflate using a removable power source- it disconnects so that you don't have to worry about your tot playing with the controls, or worse, the plug, during the night. Overall a great bed that we have already used a number of times while visiting relatives."
5,great bed for kids!!!,"Bought this for my grandkids... They love it!! Inflates very fast AND Deflates even faster. Takes a small amount of space when traveling by air. The slightly higher sides have kept them from rolling out while sleeping, and the cloth cover is a snap to install and no sticky plastic contact. Will store this in the emergency kit for the family when not in use. A very well thought out product!!"
5,Tavel bed,"We used this air mattress for our toddler on vacation. She loved it. It was agreat way to avoid using unsafe, possibly recalled, or not so clean hotel cribs. We folded it nto a carry on size suitcase and checke it! Would recommend it."
4,"GREAT mini aero-bed, bit noisy for my squirmers.","I LOVE this bed! My sister-in-law was so jealous when she saw it. Now it is perfect, has the bumpers, --look at the measurments -- because it was bigger than I thought, but perfect. It has a sheet that is soft and stays on. The only issue, but I think this is with any blowup bed... is that it is loud when you squirm around. That rubbing rubber sound... and kids move ALOT. Over all, It worked for 2 weeks away at realatives (for a 2 and a half year old) and I let my mom keep it at her house for overnight from the girls.DOesn't loose air, I added some every three days or so on our long stretch. It blows up super fast, same going down, and it's put away within 1 minute."
5,Great answer for Grand Kids coming to visit,"We have 2 grandchildren that have 'graduated' out of pack n plays to bigger beds, but still can't sleep in an adult bed. This was the perfect answer the AreoBed has an inflatable 'ring' around the bed so they don't roll out, but the air mattress is still on the floor, so that they won't have much of a drop if they do get out. We used them for the last week, and were well pleased."
5,Perfect,"We purchased this bed for our 2 year old to sleep on during vacation. I must say that it is one of the best purchases I have made! I have a very opinionated little girl and she loved this bed! She even took a few naps on it, which is a miracle for her. I must admit, I was skeptical considering the price, but it is well worth the money. It inflates and deflates in a flash and doesn't take up much room when traveling. Highly recommend!"
5,Aerobed for Kids,"I love this product! It was the best $$ ever spent. It literally inflates in less than a minute, and stays inflated. We had it up for a week just to let my son lay on it and bounce on his new ""bed"" for Gramma and Grampa's house. It didn't lose an ounce of air. I also didn't realize that the mattress cover was going to be included, and that was a wonderful surprise. It is so soft!! We are very pleased with this purchase and feel we got a lot for the money, and you can't beat the free shipping! Highly recommend."
5,Easy to use and very compfy!,"My 2 1/2 year old loves this bed, we use it when we travel. It's an Aerobed so the thing is built very well and it's super easy to inflate and deflate. It pumps up very quickly and deflates in mere seconds. The raised edges are great for keeping the little one safe and snug and it's super comfortable. Another winner!"
5,Best baby/toddler gift ever,"We use this everywhere. Parents house, hotels, sleepovers. It packs away small and is very simple to inflate. After two years, we found a leak. Called the company and they replaced it immediately. Can't beat that!"
5,What's not to love?!,"I'll be honest, I didn't buy our bed from amazon. I lucked out and paid $30 brand new at a discount store a few years ago. My daughter is 3 and after she was 1 it was just annoying to drag her pack and play everywhere, PLUS we never had any room for it!This bed is amazing! My daughter loves it and her and I BOTH fit on the bed comfortably for snuggle time. We have used this bed NUMEROUS amounts of times!! If something ever happens to our bed, I have NO PROBLEM paying $80 for it brand new because it's definitely WORTH the money!!!"
1,This would have been a good idea.,I had to send back because the bed was to noisy. Kept waking up my grandson. They should have put the soft stuff on the top. I have a queen size air bed and it works great. I wanted the smaller one for overnights with just him and did not work.
2,Great concept but VERY NOISY!,"We bought this for when our 2-year-old granddaughter visits. It fits nicely between the regular bed and dresser in the guest bedroom, it's super easy to inflate and deflate, and comes with a cozy fleece cover in a fun print. But I have to agree with a previous reviewer, the slightest move results in a LOUD rubbing-plastic noise, I mean loud enough to wake not only my granddaughter but her parents sleeping in the regular bed beside her. And young children tend to move around lot during the night! We have already discarded the box and packaging so I'm not sure we can even return it after all this time. Next visit we plan to give it one more try by varying the amount of inflation, but right now it's 'thumbs down' by everyone in the family, especially when it wakes the toddler up at 5 AM and she doesn't want to go back to sleep!"
2,This bed never held air very well,"I purchased this bed for my daughter's first Brownie overnight. Everyone commented that she had the best bed. It is very easy to blow up, as long as there is an electric outlet. I'm not sure how this will work for camping where there is no electricity. My daughter loves the sheet that came with the bed. It is very soft and cozy, allowing her to bring her favorite blanket along. However, it doesn't seem to keep air very long. From the very first night the bed was flat in the morning. I can't imagine it has a hole and needs patching since it is brand new. I'm disappointed that I spent so much for something that doesn't work very well."
2,Aerobed,"We bought one for when our great granddaughter comes and visits. I have had to patch it 4 times so far. It seems to be in the welded creases that form the chambers, very hard to find and not easy to patch. We are quite disappointed with this bed and are looking for an alternative. We live in an apartment so we are tight on storage space."
5,Quick & easy,"Our granddaughter loves having her own little bed. It is quick and easy to set up and take down. The cover makes it comfy and cozy. I like having the bag for storage, and the bed rolls up easily to fit in the bag, unlike some tents I've had! This was the perfect solution for us."
5,Kid's Aero Bed,"This is my second kid's aerobed. I purchased the first one for my grandson, Max, and he LOVED it. When not sleeping, he would pull it out to the living room to watch TV. It is so easy to inflate and put away when the grandkids go home. The fleece cover is great - soft and snugly and goes right in the washer/dryer. They're coming to visit us again, and this time Jack is big enough so he'll use the new one.this time"
4,Great for grandchildren!,"AeroBed for KidsThis is a fantastic item to have for visiting grandchildren. The instructions say it inflates in less than 60 seconds. Well, I think it took all of 30 seconds to inflate, and when I was ready to put it away, it deflated in less time than that. It folds up compactly and fits in the storage bag along with the sheet and the pump, so storage is easy. My 2 1/2 year old grandson loved it, and it didn't lose any air even when he used it as a trampoline. I just wish the sides were a little higher."
4,Easy portable bed for kids!,"This is a very easy portable bed for children. I bought it for my 1 year old grandson and he loved it! It inflates very fast and seemed to be very comfortable. I like how the sides are raised so there is no falling out of the bed. I would have given it 5 stars but I do feel it is over priced, although the Amazon price was the best. I know you can purchase a raised, twin size bed at Walmart for around the same price as this one, if not cheaper, I just needed something smaller. If you don't mind spending some money for something like this, I would definately recommend this bed."
5,Great for trips to Grandma's house,"I bought this bed for my 2 year old when we visit Grandma's house. He is too big for a crib and rolls off a regular bed so this is perfect for him. He loves sleeping in this bed, it is comfortable and it is his own special bed. The air pump is great and blows up the mattress in seconds. I love that it comes with a custom sheet that fits the mattress perfectly. I highly recommend this for anyone who travels with a toddler."
5,Outstanding,This is a great bed! We bought it for our 3 year old for sleepovers at grandparents huuse and ended up using it as the primary bed for a few weeks when she suddenly outgrew her toddler bed. She loved it and did not want to buy a big girl bed. Great product. Not only is it a great bed but the bumpers around the edge are great!
4,Love it,"I have to say I am very impressed with the Aerobed we purchased. My daughter is only 19 months and hasn't quite figured out that you sleep on it (we've been using the pack n play on vacation until she's comfortable sleeping without sides). It's easy to assemble and easy to put away. My husband was doubting that it would fold back up easily, but it truly does. The cover that comes with it is so soft too! Would definately recommend this product."
2,Noisy product,"After reading reviews on several manufactures of these kind of childrens air mattresses I decided on the aero bed. I believe one review did mention the mattress was noisy but let me tell you, it is so annoying everytime my grandson made any little movement it made this sound. I don't know if the noise kept him from sleeping sound but we did not have a good experience. Other specs of the mattress are ok as far as ease of inflation. Not really much of a bumper for keeping a child from falling off. I am currently waiting a response from aero bed on the return policy because I will not be able to use the mattress."
5,great,"This product is great ---- actually lives up to its description. packs small, inflates fast, good size, edge prevents child from rolling off. we use it for our 2 year old when traveling. if you do any traveling and your child is too old for a pack-and-play, you will be very happy with this."
5,Great for sleep-aways!,"I would highly recommend this air mattress. It is so easy to both blow up and put away. It stores easily and compactly. And, most importantly, it's comfortable! Perfect for Grandma's house."
4,EXCELLENT PRODUCT,"We bought this for my 5 year old who is having trouble sleeping in her own room. We leave it by the side of our bed and if she gets up in the middle of the night she just comes in our room and lays down. This is a great bed and inflates quickly and also stores great in the bag! And the mattress cover is super soft!Only negative I have is that because it is an inflatable mattress, when its chilly it stays cool since its filled with air."
5,Awesome travel bed,"I bought this bed for my 3 year old to sleep in at her grandmother's house over the holidays. She loves it! The moon and stars cover is thick and plush. I looked at a similar bed on the Leaps and Bounds web site, and this bed has it beat for both price and quality. If you have to travel with little ones, this is the bed to get."
4,Really like it!,"This little bed is great! I bought it for my two-and-a-half year old daughter to use at our friend's house when my husband and I went away for our anniversary. She stayed in the bed and slept great in it. We plan on taking it with us on a trip back east in May for her to sleep on while at relatives. It's not too heavy, rolls up really easy, pumps up really fast, and is very sturdy. I didn't give it four stars because the cover is made of heavy weight fleece, although this doesn't affect the function of the bed at all. It will be fine in our high desert winters, but in the 105 degree heat of summer, it's going to be WAY too hot for her to sleep on when she needs too. I really wish Aerobed would have provided a traditional cotton sheet to go with this bed. I'm going to try to make a slip cover for it out of a fitted twin sheet. We'll see how that goes!"
5,Grandson bed,I was so happy when my 2 year old grandson loved his new bed. It was just the right size for him. Better than I could have imagined it to be. A lot thicker than the regular blow up beds. I know he will get a lot of use out of it. Would recommend this to all grand parents.
5,this aerobed worked perfectly!,We bought this for our 2 yr old to use on vacation. We just transitioned her to a big kid bed and were worried she would fall out of a regular bed without rails. This bed was super comfortable and she adapted very easily. It is very strong and easy to blow up and deflate quickly. I like that the sides are higher so she won't roll off. The mattress protector is very soft but is fleece so we put a cotton twin sheet over it which fit fine.we are thrilled with this purchase and think it will get a lot of use in various situations.
1,Slow leak,"I ordered this for my grandson who comes 2 times a year to visit. After the first night of use we noticed it had a slow leak.We though we could have improperly closed the valve but we tried again this visit and it has a slow leak and deflates. I am going to try to return it, but don't know what will happen. Would not recommend buying this item."
5,Wonderful purchase,"This product has been perfect for traveling with a 2yr old and needing a great place to let her nap and sleep at night. Love the raised sides, for our daughter rolls around alot and she hasn't fallen out of this bed yet."
3,"Good Bed, VERY NOISY","This bed is a great option for travel- inflates very quickly & effortlessly. The sheet that comes with it is very soft & padded. However, if you're planning on having your child sleep in the same room with you, be aware that you will hear their EVERY move throughout the night. I'm not quite sure how to correct this- maybe a fitted mattress cover??? Haven't tried that out yet but if that's the case then it's just one more thing you have to figure into your packing. At this point, I'd rather have my child just use a sleeping bag because both my husband & I got a HORRIBLE night's sleep when our son slept in the same room with us."
3,Misleading dimensions,"Amazon states that this bed is 25"" x 50"" with 4"" cushion, which would bring overall footprint dimension to 33""x 58"" in reality, the foot print is 41"" x 67"" and if you plan to use it in any tight space, you'd be unpleasantly surprised. Three stars, since if the size of this mattress is not important to you, it is still a descent product."
5,great product!,"I bought this bed for my granddaughter,(3yrs old), to use over the holiday visit. It inflated and deflated so easily. It's made well, is comfortable, especially with the included soft mattress cover and it packs up compactly for storage. It exceeded my expectations! Thanks Amazon."
5,Love it!,"Seconds to inflate, easy to pack up after use. I usually can never get things back in the storage bag after taking it out the first time...this storage bag is plenty big enough. My kids fight over who gets to sleep on it..my younger 2 can fit together...great product."
5,This one Mommy!,"My 30mth old daughter loves this! We bought it to get her ready for holiday travel. She is really tall and is too long for her pack and play now. We have been ""practicing"" sleeping in it, since she hadn't yet gone to a toddler bed, and now she doesn't want to sleep in her regular bed. The raised sides let her feel safe with no fear of rolling out of bed. If I give her a choice or try to put her in her crib, she points to the AeroBed and shouts, ""THIS ONE MOMMY!"". She is roudy, bouncing on it and playing with an assortment of toys in it. So far I've never had to refill it and it has been over a month in daily use. It seems durable and the included cover is cozy. This will be perfect for our three weeks of travel without a regular bed."
4,Awesome product BUT...,"We bought this for my 2.5yr old when we were going on vacation. He absolutely loved it, one for its size which was bigger than his toddler bed and second because it was so comfortable. We loved how quickly it inflated - I don't even think it takes 30 seconds- honestly! After buying this matress based on the reviews stating that the durability was excellent, we were greatly disappointed when on day 2 of our 6 night vacation the matress went flat due to an obvious rip on the seam. I was so very mad. Fortunately we were able to buy some duct tape at the store to create a make-shift patch that did the trick for the remainder of the vacation. I did expect better durability for the cost but otherwise its a great product. One review that I read stated that it was noisy- I did not find that to be the case and my son moves all over the place at night."
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought this for my son who's 4 1/2 years old to use on our trip. The pump makes a very loud and annoying sound when it thinks the mattress is full. Ours never fully inflated. I tried unplugging the pump and plugging it back in but it wouldn't inflate any further. He slept on it inflated to about 90% and said it was just ""OK"" but when he wanted to take a nap he stated he wanted to ""lay in the big bed to be more comfortable"". Now we're home and I wanted to set it up to use in my bedroom since he sometimes comes in during the middle of the night. Now it won't inflate at all. I turn it on and it immediately starts making the sound it makes when it's full and it doesn't have a drop of air in it. I'm really disappointed. And I can't return it."
5,Kids AeroBed,My son loves this bed. We no longer have problems with him getting up in the night when we go on vacation or when he spends the night at grandma and grandpa's house. This bed makes him feel right at home wherever he is. Very happy with my purchase!
4,My son loves it better than his own bed!,"This is a great bed to travel with. We are in the military and in the middle of a move. My son has been sleeping on his bed for almost a month now and he sleeps better in it, on his own, than in his own toddler bed. Some other reviews have noted that it is noisey. . . it is, but no more than any other airbed. This was the perfect solution for us and I would recommend to anyone."
4,good for the gal!,"We travel in state a lot for bike races. It is great to go to a hotel and not have to share a bed with our 2 and half year old. She loves it too. She thinks it's special and that makes bed time in a strange place a whole heck of a lot easier. We like how compact it is; much more packable than her old pac n'play. The removable washable cover is handy as well as comfortable. It does make a little more noise than we would like, but hey...can you really have it all. It is a nice firm travel bed and good for little guest at home as well. Stores and cleans easy. A good buy. And best of all, our daughter looks forward to using it!"
5,3 years on- still works great!,"This is the one inflatable mattress in my house that is still working as great as when we got it three years ago. I WISH they made this in larger sizes because the other INTEX air mattresses lasted a few months at most.We've been using this since my son was three when cousins or young friends would sleep over. My kids would beg to sleep in it as soon as it was inflated.We've also taken it with us on numerous trips. My 6 year old son still fits in it fine, and my 9 year old daughter as well (just barely).I highly recommend this mattress it is sturdy and durable. My kids have jumped on it, wrestled on it, etc etc. Inflating is a breeze, deflating is as simple as opening the latch at the bottom and the warm fuzzy sheet is a nice addition. It is light and easy to move. The kids love snuggling in it and it is much more convenient in tight spaces.One of the best purchases we have ever made."
5,Great Buy!,"I read many reviews before making my purchase. I was pleasantly surprised that none of the negative reviews that I read were true for my purchase. My 19 month old loves it. The cover for it is perfect. I don't hear or feel any plastic rubbing or sounds from the bed. It is very comfortable and my little one took to it right away. I see no negative aspects of this item so far. So easy to inflate and deflate. Love the bag. Holds everything, bed, cover and pump. Pump is not heavy either. Very pleased! Would recommend to anyone who needs an optional bed for kids or in our case when you travel."
4,Nice bed for toddler,We went on vacation and needed a bed that my daughter could not fall out of. She is 20 months old and not big enough to sleep in a big bed by herself. It was very easy to inflate and deflate. My daughter thought it was great that she had her own little bed. She usually ended up in bed with us during the night but I think that had to do more with being in a new place and not at home in her crib. I know we will get a lot of use out of this bed in the future.
5,Motel in a bag,"Easy to set up and inflate, easy to deflate and pack. The storage bag is large enough to make it easy to put the mattress into it when the stay is over. Even a kid can do it.During the first use test it stayed inflated for five nights. We think the grandkids could have stayed longer but we were ready for their parents to leave."
4,child air mattress,very easy to set up..the contours help the child not roll out which was wonderful. I guess could be used up to 6 year old... we were happy with it and the 3 1/2 was happy sleeping on it.
5,The best inflatable bed for kids ever!,"I own three of these beds. With eight grandchildren and one on the way, they are used often. In fact our four year-old grandson loves to spend the night with us just so he can sleep in 'his bed'. The slightly raised sides are a comfort to little ones and yet the length of this bed and it's strength make it usable for even our 8 and 9 year-olds. Can't say enough about how great they are!"
5,Great travel bed,"We bought two of these for our 4 yr old and 3 yr old a year ago and absolutely love it. Our visits to family have us staying with the kids in a one room. We've tried camping pads but they slide right off (which as you parents know means no sleep for anyone in that room). We have a larger aero bed but the size of that wouldn't fit in the room we stay in. This bed is perfect. The kids each have their own bed (and they are identical so they don't fight over who gets which one), it has the aero compressor so it quickly inflates. The kids now want use them at home to sleep on because they are so comfortable, so we do sleep overs in each of their rooms.We are now buying two more of these beds for my parents because they are such a hit with all of the grandkids.Great bed and a great buy!"
5,Aero Bed for kids,It works great wehn my granddaughter come over it takes up very little room. Plus she think it is great for sleeping.
3,"Nice item, just as described, great price","Ordered this for my 21 mo. old for our vacation, but she didn't sleep very well on it. It inflated so easily and quickly, and we had fun lounging on it in front of the TV. She's still in a crib at home, so I think she was just not ready for a more ""open"" style of sleeping. We'll try again another time."
2,"I sooo wanted this to work out, but it broke.","I had really high hopes for this. Unfortunately the valve broke and now we can't get it fully inflated. Then we wanted to use it yesterday, but can't find the little rubber ring that helps keep the air in. So for $70 we have used it about 3 weeks. When it was working it was fantastic. We took it on the plane, my son loved it, but now we have to get something else. Now we'll go with a regular twin air mattress. The raised sides didn't help keep my son in all that much anyway. He still rolled out a few times."
3,expected better.....,"I first will say that the bed inflates in 2 minutes which is great. I was disappointed that the edge wasn't higher, my daughter still managed to fall out/off the bed in the middle of the night. The mattress isn't ""flocked"" like other aerobeds which kind of gives it a pool float look about it ( which stinks when you consider how much you are paying). The cover is fleece and toasty."
1,Had a hole in it when it came out of the box!,"We owned one of these and had it for a couple of years before it developed a hole. This one, however, had a hole in it when we took it out of the box! And because we didn't use it as soon as we bought it we are stuck with it. The hole is where a patch just will not fix it so total waste of $$. If you buy one test the mattress as soon as you get it! I thought I still had some time since other things on that order can still be returned, but there are different policies in place for air mattresses."
1,Warning,"The Aerobed Inflatable Bed for Kids that I ordered for a granddaughter to use while staying here just arrived. I was surprised to see that the box is clearly labeled, ""Great for Kids 4+"" and , ""This bed is not for use by children 3 years old or younger"". These warnings were not given either in the product description or in other reviews. I will keep the bed to use in the future, but now I will have to purchase something to use for the next two years. I had hoped to have an item that would work both now and in the future."
1,Chiuldren's aero bed,"The grandchildren love it! Each family has one and whenever they come to visit, the little ones ( 2 1/2, 3 1/2, 5) use their own. Using product for about 8 years and now the youngest has his own. they stand up to folding, are easy to set up and take down and the one which is about eight years old is still in fine form."
4,Good for trips,"THis is great for trips. It blows up fast and its lip seems to hold my tossing toddler in at night. THe only negative is that the pump is not connected to the bed like adult aerobeds, but it blows up just as fast."
4,3 year old slept great!,"We bought this for our 3 year old to sleep on while we had family in town and his Cousin slept in his bed. He slept really well and thought it was fun! I would have given it five stars, if the plastic didn't smell so strong..."
3,"it is ok, but very noisy.","The bed is fine for its purposes, and does keep the baby from falling off the sides, but since the top is the same PVC material as the whole mattress (not the plush/velvety material found on other types of mattresses), any turning on this bed is very audible, because of the friction between the cover and the PVC. Using normal crib sheet does not solve the problem. We have queen size Coleman's air mattress - it does not have such problem at all."
5,Great travel bed for toddler!,This bed is great! It is super easy to inflate and deflate and I love that it comes with a bag to carry everything in. The sheet that comes with the bed is nice because it fits perfectly and I don't have to mess with sheets that are too big. This bed helped us transition our 2 1/2 year old daughter into her big girl bed! She loves her air mattress!
5,"much better than a ""pack and play""","Inflated easily. Mattress pad fits nicely and you can use your own twin sheets. Our 2 year old granddaughter was still in her crib when we ordered this AeroBed for her visit. She loved it! It is quite comfortable- but a little exciting like ""camping out"". I have told all my fellow grandparents about this wonderful product."
3,"Nice bed, but noisy!","I bought this bed many years ago for my grandson. It's really a great bed. The cover is soft and washes easily. It's easy to move to different rooms. Problem is, my grandson flops around all night and I, like others who reviewed this, found the squeaking and scrunching sound all night to be too much. I tried many things, as others did on here; more padding, a rug in between the bed and bedding, etc. I really like the bed, it's well made, but it's just not usable if you are bothered by the air mattress sounds."
2,2nd Purchase of Beds- Disappointed,"This is the second time I have purchased these beds and they are just not the same as the first set. Unfortunately we mistakenly left our first two beds behind on a camping trip. Our original set was great. We used them many times without a problem. I cannot say the same for our recent purchase. As others have stated, they are incredibly loud. If you are a light sleeper, you will not be able to sleep in the same room with your child in these beds. Every time they shift or roll-over they make a horribly loud noise. I have tried piling on additional blankets and comforters on top, which hasn't worked. Additionally, after only 2 or 3 uses one of them will not hold air. These beds are going in the trash and will be replaced by something less expensive and quieter. I have always had good luck with Aero beds, but these beds have made me think twice about buying the Aero brand again due to inconsistent quality."
4,Mother-in-law was right!,This is just what we needed to give to Grandma. Our child didn't want to sleep in his Pack-N-Play so we thought we would give this a try. He loves acting like a big kid and sleep in his own bed for naps when Grandma is watching him. I'm glad I listened to my mother-in-law and purchased this bed.
5,A life saver!,"Traveling with a 6 year old and a 2 year old, I have to say that this thing helped out so much. It was comfy and the fitted fleece cover was cute and soft.. the raised edges kept my 2 year old from rolling off. My in-laws have all-tile floors so even making a pallet of blankets on the floor wasn't really a good option. This was perfect. It did take up a chunk of a suitcase but it is light and easy and SO WORTH IT. Highly recommend this for travelers with small children. Oh, and my 6 1/2 year old boy really wanted to sleep on it instead of the sofa bed. He's small for his age but he would have had no problem making this his bed. We will get years of use out of this with all family living out of town."
5,thanks!,"this book shows me a way of connection whit my partner. thanks, Imago. i will countinue to go for connection."
1,Ugh.,"I had been told this book supposedly cuts through some of thejunk that books of this type suffer from, and was looking forward to it because of that. Unfortunately, it managed to completely dash my hopes on the jagged rocks of inanity. Maybe my expectations were too high, but I was completely disappointed in the lack of practicality in this book. Sure to be a big winner with the intelligentsia in the psychiatric / psychological communities; but every bit as sure to be a loser when it comes to giving solid, practical advice to normal, everyday parents like me."
5,A must read for any parent that loves his or her child.,"Harville Hendrix and his wife, Helen, write with humor,humility, and humanity. They offer parents a clear and simple (albeit challenging) plan for developing caring, compassionate, competitive and courageous children. Read it and use it to give your children one of the best gifts in life--- a great start in life. Perhaps Dr. Hendrix's greatest accomplishment is in becoming to readers the loving and wise father and mother that he was cheated from when they both died by the time Harville was six years old."
2,"A beautiful deck, but...","Although I am not Catholic or Gnostic, I bought this deck because the artwork is beautiful. However, I was disappointed with the deck after I got it home. The author's interpretations for some cards leave much to be desired, having a paragraph's worth of rendering for some cards, and a single sentence for others. Also, on some of the Minor cards like Swords and Coins, you have only a picture of the element itself -- no ""scene"" to spark your imagination or intuition. Just a picture of some swords and some coins. What gives? You get the feeling that the author got tired of his otherwise creative process. I took this deck back to the store the next day for a refund."
3,"Ok, not as great as I thought (see previous review)...","Well, I've worked with this deck a little more, and I have to say, some of the initial appeal wore off since my previous review. I have found that a lot of my readings have been very vague with this deck. Perhaps it's just my personal taste, but I prefer a deck that gives the reader a lot of ""jumping off"" points. With this deck, for several cards, you can get one or maybe two meanings. By contrast, with the Rider-Waite and its progeny, you can generally find many springboards for discussion in each card."
5,Wonderful Tarot System,"This is wonderful deck and book. It is a whole new Christian Tarot system based on Gnosticism. You don't have to be a Gnostic to use it though. Place, one of the leading Tarot scholars of today, was raised Catholic so the feeling and the philosophy of the deck will be familiar to Catholics. It is a wonderful deck, though, for anyone who is sympathetic to the essence of Christian spirituality. It's not for fortune telling. It's a meditative deck and is an excellent tool for helping a person to make explicit his implicit wisdom and spirituality and for finding inner peace."
4,An excellent buy,"The Sony home theater system preformed excellent for the cost. It was easy to hook up and balance with the included microphone. One improvement would be to supply a coil of speaker wire and push in connections on the back of the speakers. I had to cut 2 speaker wires off and splice them to wires that were too short for the surround speakers. Treble and bass adjustment was done without a hitch. Selecting FM stations for pre-select handled very well. The ability to pull in FM stations was on the weak side, even with the included antenna mounted horizontal. I have a cassette tape deck, a CD changer and DVD/VCR deck connected to my unit."
3,Good System (while it lasts...),"This is the first surround sound system that I have owned. I got it for free from Best Buy when I bought my HDTV. I really enjoyed the sound quality and it met my TV and Videogame needs.Unfortunately, my front right speaker went out after about 1 year of daily use. It was all staticky so I had to unplug it. It's been about another year after that and I'm starting to get a lot of static in the other speakers whenever there is an explosion in a videogame. Looks like it's time to get some new speakers...I don't know what the average lifetime of a surround sound system is, but it seems like it should last more than 1-2 years."
1,Sony surround sounds great,"I was real apprehensive about this installation, and quite surprised how easy it was. The sound makes our new tv come to life.Only bad thing is I hit the back button while ordering, and actually received 2 of them! My son bought the other one, after hearing the system He installed for me."
3,Sony Shortcomings,"This system would be a very good system for the money if it had better speakers. I has a large woofer but very small and cheap surround sound speakers. The recevier seems to be very good. For the money, it is a good buy, just don't expect too much."
4,Plesently Pleased,"I bought this system as a starter system, and I have to say, WOW!!! I read all these bad reviews, but for me coming from not having one to now having this, I am amazed. I watched ""300"" with a buddy of mine and he went on and on about how good of a system this was. So, I would say as a starter system, cannot go wrong."
4,Home Theater System,"This is a great product and I have enjoyed it immensely, connected to your computer or ipod makes a great sound system as a an extra from a very affordable but great Home Theater System. Its ideal for a normal size room or simply the bed room. the only glitch I find is that there's no way to disconnect the cable from the speakers , witch is a minor inconvenience for the rest of the goodies."
4,Good sound on a low budget..,"Sony has put together a fine sound system at a good price. The subwoofer is not as powerful as a lot of systems may be, but it is sufficient. Remember, this is a 5.1 surround sound system that does not have video switching. Combo this unit with something like a Phillips video autoswitcher which can handle up to 4 video sources and you will have a low budget, excellent sounding Audio/Video system. The Phillips unit is about 30 bucks."
2,Mega Vibration in Subwoover,"This unit is just ""OK."" While it handles regular TV and radio decently, you can't have anything with big bass. That leaves out most music these days. The subwoofer vibrates and you will be annoyed. The previous reviews are correct in saying that it gives no room to grow. I can plug my iPod into my TV, but not the audio tuner. UH... ok. I'm currently on a search for a decently priced iPod compatible system. I guess you really do get what you pay for. It's good for entry level but if you know you'll need more later, don't bother."
2,Lasted only a few months. Too much cost-cutting by Sony.,"I totally concur with the previous reviewer. For me the consequence of the hard-wired speakers and the fact that the speaker wire is the smallest guage possible was that one of the wires tore out of the back of the speaker. No way to fix or splice it. Well, I didn't like the speakers anyway and thought getting a receiver for under $200 wasn't bad but, yep, I ran out of inputs (I agree, this receiver has the fewest I've ever seen). So I threw out the speakers almost immediately and I sold the receiver out of my garage for $25 4 months later. Sometimes what seems to be a bargain is not really a bargain in the end but a waste of money. For about twice as much money you can get a system that is 10 times better! I know because I did it."
4,You might like it more than the Greatest Hits album,"Funki-de-funk funky stuff, it grooves it moves and Call Me is da JOINT!"
1,Might not be the real thing,"I've purchased this particular perfume at department stores for a few years now since the fragrance smells great (fresh, doesn't make you want to sneeze), and decided to get it from Amazon since it was cheaper. It doesn't smell exactly like the one in stores (although it smells similar), which makes me think it could be fake (or watered down??). The perfume fades quickly which is strange since I've only needed a spray or two of this perfume in the past, and it stays on for a long time. I wouldn't buy this from Amazon again, and wouldn't recommend anyone buy this from Amazon."
5,Lauren perfume,"I have loved this perfume since the 70's -- My daughter says she can't smell it, she says it just ""smells like Mom.""It is light, yet deep -- like light filtering through an afternoon forest."
1,Normally a Great Fragrance-Amazon Selling a Cheap Knock-Off,BLUF -Do NOT buy this from Amazon; there is no way to get your money back! My wife has been wearing Lauren for years and has loved it (and I love it on her). I decided to get it for her from Amazon as a gift because I had Amazon Prime. What she got smelled nothing like the original perfume -it smelled a LOT like the anti-ant spray we use on the patio. What is amazing is that she says it even smells WORSE than the super-cheap knock-off version being sold out of the back of a trunk at a flea market for $5. I am out of 70 bucks and in the doghouse with my wife. At least I can use it to keep ants (and any other self-respecting bug) off of our patio!
5,PERFECT!,"WOW - this was an all around PERFECT shopping experience (super fast, wonderful quality product, great packaging!) Thanks so very much!"
3,scent doesn't last long,"I purchased this a couple of months ago. It smells just like the Ralph Lauren, but to me, it just seems like I have to keep re-applying to keep the smell on me. After an hour or so, the scent is gone."
1,Very Bad Product,I received my order in a fashionable time. Very unhappy with the quality of this item. There is no fragrance. I don't know how to go about getting my $45 back.
5,LOVE IT,"I've been over 5 years using Ralph.It's the only one I like. Can't find something similar.It smells soft, but sweet. It' Great. I Love It."
1,I hate this product,"This perfume stinks,, its not Ralph Lauren,, as we know it.. False advertising at its worstCant get a refund either,,, so unfair"
5,lovely,I love Ralph Lauren products and have used other perfumes from this line. It is light and fresh. Great for Summer
5,"Love, love, love this fragrance!","I just adore this fragrance. It's fresh, light, feminine, and floral and not at all overpowering or musty. It's described as a ""combination of sparkling green apple leaves, zesty orange mandarin, charismatic pink magnolia, seductive purple freesia, and soft blue musk that explodes into a colorful floral fragrance."" Don't let the blue musk part scare you, because this is definitely a soft and dainty scent. It reminds me of wildflowers and Spring time. I can smell it throughout the day, especially if I spray a little bit on my clothes. When I was wearing it recently, a lady said, ""That smells expensive."" It's classy and timeless. Definitely signature scent material."
3,Not my favorite Ralph,"When I spray it on, I can't spell it after the first few minutes. My first Ralph Lauren fragrance was Ralph Hot. I really like it because it has a distinct scent and lasts all day. It's suited more for evening wear and that's why I wanted to purchase this scent. I'm glad I decided on the 1 oz. jar, because I have many other fragrances I can smell and prefer."
1,Goes to show you shouldn't purchase perfume online,"The product arrived on time, but was leaking despite the packaging. I guess it just goes to show you shouldn't purchase perfume online"
2,Bad smell,Not like the Lauren I remember. Unless perhaps it's been sitting around since the 70s or 80s and has completely changed scent.
3,Good smell okay produc,It smells good but smell doesn't last long at all other than that its okay. Good price for it. I probably wouldn't buy it again.
4,Hmmm,I only bought this perfume because I was running low on a tiny bottle I bought at Zephora. I loved that little bottle it smells so sweet and delicious. But this one I bought through Amazon was slightly different on the scent. It's supposed to be the same fragrance but I could smell the slight difference. I made sure it was the same name and brand on the bottle. The only difference between them was that the Zephora bottle had little butterflies on the cap. Don't get me wrong it smells good but its a slight different from the Zephora one. And personally I like the Zephora one better.
5,you can be happy only if you serve God,"the author explains that fear is an idol and when we give up to fear, we serve an idol, not God. We are unhappy when we serve idols because we have not surrendered to God. this book helped me tremendosly in understanding how to be at pease with myself and everyone else. one of the best books i have ever read."
4,spotty but valuable,"Admittedly this work is spotty in clarity and quality of writing, but incomparably valuable. If there is another resource of comparable brevity and concision, breadth and depth, and packing a similar emotional punch, I would like to know of it. He outlines the core of numerous useful psychological resources, entwining them within an evangelical theology that clarifies both personal idolatries and paths to true atonement. Readers will see themselves in these pages, and in seeing their darkness delineated, may find hope."
1,his songs all sound the same.,"Too crazy, no melody, just drive you crazy listening to it, irritating. There is only one good song, other than that, its too.......BAD."
5,Best for Undergraduate level,"As a contract engineer, I designed a brushless DC motor controller and my company needed a good reference for them to understand the control system. This was far better than all the books I read.Most people deal with low order control systems and don't want the math to get in the way of understanding the concept. But control systems is a big topic and not typically well explained.This book is first rate from begining to end; It derives clearly and consisely all math. Builds a good tool set of common place real world examples. And, explians concepts clearly with good illustration.."
5,Great engineering textbook,"This is a textbook that's actually worth the price. Definitely one of the best engineering textbooks I have come across. The explanations are clear and precise, and the questions are stimulating. It's a great book to learn the fundamentals of control systems."
4,"not his best, but good horror","the always good campbell black[also known as thomas altman and campbell armstrong],here wrote a solid,scary novel,but the haunted summer/beach house and ouija board seems a little tired today,in 2000[maybe not in the early eighties when this was first published],but blacks style of prose is riveting,and its difficult to put down this or any of his works.......really the only reason this gets 4 instead of 5 stars is due to the predictability of the ending,which will not surprise most horror readers.......still,its way ahead of most horror novels.....too bad blacks not writing in this field anymore.....great book!"
2,Wake me when it's over!,"The premise was sooo interesting: In the early 1900's, a man and a girl commit suicide under very mysterious circumstances at a remote beach house. In the present day, which happens to be the 80's, two women and their teenaged children rent the house and weird things start to happen.This should have really held my interest, but it didn't. The characters were agonizingly dull, their reactions frustrating, there was no sense of pacing or heigtened suspense. It took me about a month to get through it, I kept putting it down to read other things...like cereal boxes, War & Peace, etc."
1,Destroyed my control arm.,"This item went on my 4x4 2001 dodge dakota and immediately became a problem. Destroyed the threads on my control arm, made a thunking and vibrating on every bump i hit. Reccomend billstien HD. ALSO went for return and still have not received refund or notice from the company."
1,Never Buy Rancho,"I got these shocks, they have issues with the fit on my durango, the rubber bushings are the wrong size and the shocks make all kinds of clunks when I hit bumps... I will never buy Rancho anything again... YUCK! One shock has since broke about 6 months after I put them on. Now over a year of driving on them all the bushings were worn away and the rear shocks were metal to metal so the clunking was so loud people would look at my truck when I even hit a bump in a parking lot going 5 MPH!AND AND ALL THIS Never even taking it off road yet! theses SUCK!"
2,"asian beauties, vol2","it was a decent movie, but is was a kinda of low budget movie. if you like asian scenery, check it out"
2,Amazingly Easy Puppet Plays,"This book does have a large selection of puppet plays that takes very little in the way of stage props and puppets. It has some good ideas for beginners on making puppets and props. Most of the skits are high on entertainment, but many I found encouraged playing tricks on one another for fun and sarcastic humor. As a puppeteer and a script writer I found most of them disappointing because they have little or no character building or moral lessons to offer. Even the references to reading and utilizing the library were weak."
4,Five Stars-Almost,"This book is a great start to a mini-series which is the beginning of some changes for Sweet Valley University. Jessica and Elizabeth are off on a road trip challenge in teams, with the prize a scholarship. They get split into seperate teams. Jessica, as always, spots a boy she likes right away, and spends most of the book trying to make him like her. They become good friends, but he seems unusually shy.. While Elizabeth again falls for a guy who's all wrong for her. It had a good plot which was pretty funny, and I recommend it to all SVU fans. There was just one thing wrong with it. Sam, the guy Elizabeth likes, has a practically indentical character to Conner in Senior Year! Has anyone else noticed this? That got a bit boring after a while. But overall, a good read."
3,VERY ENTERTAINING (YET ANNOYING),"This book was really interesting, showing where all the groups went on their journey. I wish the writer could have put in some scenes where Team Three and Team Four interact. It would have made the book more interesting.What I disliked about this book was how the story centered on jerks. Sam Burgess is a typical ""Don't show your feelings"" guy who's whole existence depends on being a pig to everyone he likes. Including Elizabeth, whom he likes. He even cries on her shoulder for some reason or another, and then he goes back to being a swine. It's amazing how the supposedly ""brave, strong"" men are always weak on the inside, and how sappy men are always the tough ones. It gets a little tiring after a while to see these macho guys display their weaknesses after a while.Aside from Sam Burgesse's little traumas, and the never ending ""Guy Who Stole Elizabeth's Love"" feud between Tom and Todd, this book was great."

1,A vicious attack on Christianity,"When will therapists cease to pretend to be objective? Under the guise of mental health, this is a vicious attack on Christianity, which Chesen ""diagnoses"" as an addictive disease. The only thing that this proves is that Chesen is a militant atheist who is using his credentials to display his anti-theistic bigotry."
3,Not great in the ending,"I thought this book was really good when I first started reading it. It was a great realistic family story, but then in the end lots of confusing stuff happened and the ending wasn't great. Just not one of the best books I read."
2,cakoon Sun Unbrella,It looks like a regular umbrella and I have felt a bit conspicuous and ridiculous using it so I have not used it much at all.
2,"Covers me, but it is fragile and weak","The fabric of the umbrella seems to cover me well, I don't feel the sun blazing on my face when I use it. But it has a huge drawback: the umbrella is very fragile and weak. In the slightest amount of wind, the whole umbrella shakes like it's going to collapse at any moment. And sometimes, when I am opening it, it does not latch on entirely so it will close on me spontaneously.If I had to buy an item like this again, I'd probably look for a better brand with better reviews."
3,Tool Review,"While the overall design of the product is nice I've found certain flaws and quirks in the product.1. the strap tool has no adjustments to it and will break the bands rather then tighten and snap them off2. The blade is nice but you really need to make a cover of belt holster for it, otherwise its to dangerous a tool to be loose in a tool bag of box.The Combination is great idea, but still needs work on certain sections"
5,"Eye-Opening! Well documented, and refreshing perspective.",Fresh perspective on the historical (mis)representation Western consensus has applied to the Jewish role in the Church.Victor's logical presentation and sense of humor keep the pages turning. Enjoyable!
5,Great refresher for building Sunday School,"This little book is easy to read in concise but robust chapters full of things you thought you understood about SS. Sunday School, according to Towns, is not a dinosaur to be excavated and put on display, but a powerful tool of the modern era.Sunday School can be crafted to build new converts, provide fellowship, train for ministry, and it has many other values as well.This book isn't necessarily a step by step blueprint for ""building"" a SS program in your church. It will ,however, encourage you and your SS team to see the old SS hour as a great tool to carry out the Great Comission!"
4,Wild Wild West!,"So they only had one big hit tune, and that was a couple of decades ago (or so it seems)! So what?! The infectious title cut is perfect for those warm summer nights when you want to drive around town with your windows rolled down, bopping to a beat. But most of the other songs are also not bad, making this release well worth the low purchase price."
4,Remington's failure on replacement parts,Great clock - very poor customer support. Remington does not stock replacement parts (e.g. the special bulb) so don't waste your hard-earned dollars.
3,"memories, great voice","I enjoyed the music and as always a terrific voice. The songs are very old, but I enjoyed listening to them. I wish they had some of his later songs too."
1,Not the Definitive Collection of Bing I expected!,"Really disappointed. I grew up with Bing Crosby both on records and later on tv. This album must have been his very earliest work and does not reflect at all the mature voice he later had. I did not even recognize this voice as belonging to Bing. In fact, his whistle sounds fake, too. This is not what I expected. Poor quality of vocal and orchestra. Sounds like it was played on my grandmother's ole victrola which had to wound up. Wish I had listened to the sample. Truly disappointed."
4,Pretty Good Late Collection,"Calling a single disc ""definitive"" with an entertainer as protean and prolific as Crosby is presumptuous if not misleading. I love Crosby's early work in the '30s, from the melodramatic (""Out of Nowhere"") to the jazz and scat (""Shine""). None of that material is represented here. Also missing is his later sterling performance with Bob Scobey's jazz band, including his early, arguably best, version of ""Mack the Knife."" Nevertheless, this collection at least begins to represent the remarkable multicultural and stylistic diversity of a singer who, far more than the ""modern ironical temperament"" represented by the individualist Sinatra, sang for and of the ""community."" Still, the single disc ""Bing's Gold Records,"" a chronological presentation of all 21 recording-breaking records, is the more representative, useful approach toward Crosby's versatility and singular appeal."
3,"The Definitive Crosby, a misnomer","It's called ""The Definitive Collection,"" and it isn't. Such a volume would include some of Crosby's early work with Paul Whiteman, then his later brilliance with the Mills Brothers. Any ""definitive collection"" of Crosby work would contain his ""St. Louis Blues"" recording with Duke Ellington in 1930 or so.This music is perfectly good, but I bought it for a friend who had just begun to appreciate Crosby. In that regard, it is a disappointment."
2,just not very good....,"The 30 point type instantly let me know that there wasn't much writing going on in this book (it would've made a decent pamplet). Not really any good pictures either. Basically it's just way too fluffy. I'm completely fascinated by the subject but this really only gives you names, dates and locations not much detail and absolutely no analysis. And its choice of storys is really odd. It's a sort of greatest hits that you already know about and obscure stories you don't care about, with everything inbetween left out. Where's Robert Smithson's plane crash or Bas Jan Ader's ill fated attempt to cross the Atlantic in a row boat? As for the serial killer art and motion picture deaths. Those topics properly researched and documented are books on there own, I think they were needed here to make this long enough to be a book. Basically I feel a little ripped off."
5,PORSCHE; ES GIBT KEIN ERSATZ!,"This is absolutely the most extensive, thoroughly researched tome ever written about any automobile. If you are an absolute zealot for all things Porsche, this is the volume for you. Because of the incredible amounts of detail and information, I am not sure if many people will be able to read all three volumes from cover to cover. Perhaps this was not the intent anyway. I have leafed through each volume, pausing to read the parts that are of particular interest to me. Therefore, as a reference volume, it is second to none."
2,Porsche Through Rose Glasses,"If I'd realized Mr. Ludvigsen had a past history of writing for Automotive Quarterly, I would never have wasted this much money buying this set. Just like Automotive Quarterly (which never had a bad thing to say about any automobile) Mr. Ludvigsen glosses over the problems with the 356 and early 911 road cars, the internal power struggles within the company and board, and so on.This is probably the most complete ""racing"" history of Porsche ever done and is worth it if that is what you want to know. If you are interested in the road cars, don't waste your time reading this or your money buying it."
2,less than expected but probably briefly usable,"I guess my expectations were too high. An item of this quality is the sort of thing you would expect to see on a street vendor's table selling for $7.50. It's all plastic and is begging to fall apart. I did get a great chuckle out of the manual, however. I suppose you get what you pay for except that this item is significantly overpriced. Oh well... this item makes a good case for buying locally so you can evaluate the product before purchase."
5,Favorite Movie,"I first saw this movie when i was 12. At first, when i rented it, i didn't think that i would like it, but i was proved wrong. When i watched it, it just transported me to the 60s. I loved the movie and bought it. This is a must see movie. I know that i could watch it over and over and never get tired of it. The soundtrack is wonderful, it has great oldies, and some other wonderful songs written by David Foster."
2,Disappointing follow-up,"Unfortunately, after a ten year hiatus from solo guitar composing, York copped out with this release which he shamelessly fills with 21 minutes of a Bach cello suite which everyone else has recorded; and, the cello suite, doesn't fit with the rest of the CD.Check out Denouement to hear how good York used to be."
5,modern master,"Andrew is the man. He operates on a different plain than other gutiarists and many of us wish we were there! This is a great batch of tunes with a variety of moods. Most classical guitar discs get momotonous after 5 tracks, but andrew keeps it going till the end. If you're looking for a recording of ""sunburst"" it's here and worth the price of the disc alone, but check out clips of ""marley's ghost"" and ""evening dance,"" his other more popular works. a bach cello suite arranged for guitar makes this the perfect cd if you are just looking for a classical guitar cd for your collection."
1,Windom Hill and Bach,"The Bach was okay, but I could have done without the Windom Hill Sampler. York is not a composer, and should stick to playing."
1,Macho Stupid,"This recent attempt at story telling by Earl W. Emerson suffers from the basic malady found in both his series of murder mysteries featuring the male characters Mac Fontana and Thomas Black (as well as the insipid female, Kathy). Enjoyment of these works is greatly impared by a pervasive macho stupidity. All of the stories convey ""...a false sense of charisma"" (Morons and Madmen. Earl Emerson. 1993:156) embodied in the male protaganists. An obsession with female breasts and sexual conquests bring a derisive burden to an otherwise interesting story. Insensitive, sexist commentary from a supposed studly point of view mars otherwise accomplished writing skills. The conflict always seems to revolve around men ""...whose macho territory has been invaded by women"" (ibid, page 175)."
4,Fun and sweet...what a great little book!,"The Man Who Ate the 747 was a terrific little book. The characters were vivid and amusing...and I can't get them or the story out of my mind, and I finished the book a while ago! You definitely need to be a romantic at heart to truly enjoy this story (or someone obsessed with the Guiness Book of Records) and it really will stay with you.I hope Ben Sherwood can keep it up with his next novel!"
4,different stuff but still good,"the book was really good i enjoyed reading about JJ and his ""book"". the book sets a really good example about following your heart and it was really funny."
2,"It takes off smoothly, hits turbulence, and crashes","I enjoyed the first two thirds of this novel. Ben Sherwood is clever and humorous and his prose is quite readable.I found the last part of the book, though, to be an emotional roller coaster, breaking the record for the longest roller coaster (the ""Steel Dragon 2000"" in Japan, 8133 feet). Ben Sherwood spirals downward, manipulating the reader's emotions like a two-dimensional character in a soap opera. Caveat reader."
2,"""Brain Candy"" Alert","J.J. Smith works for the Book of Records; he goes around the world searching for new and exciting records for the book. When he hears that a man is eating a 747 all for the love of a woman, he goes to investigate. Sounds promising, but I was disappointed.I have nothing against ""light,"" easy reads, or what I call ""brain candy."" Not everything that I read has to be extremely profound, but this just has no substance at all. The characters have little depth and development, and what little they did have was presented by telling instead of showing. We are told everything about the character instead of shown. Thought the premise of the story is unique, I found the plot to be predictable as well. I sped through the book just to get through it sooner. Definitely will be passing this one along."
2,This Book Bites!,Altho the 747 was a mouthful... it left a bad taste in my mouth. I needed a light read... too bad the oxygen masks did not operate... maybe some literary talent could have been breathed into this book.
3,Maybe Better On Film?,"I read somewhere (maybe this site?) that a screenplay was in the works. I can imagine this story well on the big screen. I was enchanted at the beginning of the story, but my expectations swiftly began their downhill descent. The writing was okay, the plot too predictable. It's a very short book, but I struggled to finish it. I gave it three stars basically because there were a few really good lines in it that warmed my heart. One in particular: ""..We chase wild dreams and long for all that eludes us, when the greatest joys are within our grasp, if we can only recognize them..."""
3,america at it's best,"What a sweet breath of fresh air. This is a perfect airplane book (no pun intended) or a great beach book. Yes. the man does really eat a plane to prove his love and the way this becomes such a casual fact of the story is very funning and charming.This book is about small town America, people with good hearts, the power of love and a man who finally finds his real desire in life. It will show you joy in the smallest and most unexpected places.Again, the writer has given the main character such a matter of fact voice when describing all the world records he has witnessed being broken that you can't help but get as caught up in it as he is.I loved this sweet book and will pass it on to friends."
3,The Man Who Ate the 747,"I do not think this book has lived up to all the hype. I was looking forward to reading it bc of all the positive publicity, but was dissapointed in the fact that it did not live up to my expectations. The book was slow moving and I do not think I was every fully ""into"" the book. Nonetheless, it was still a cute story and seemingly quite imaginative. This is not the love story it was made out to be, but a sweet enough story."
3,I wanted to eat a 747 after reading this book,"After reading several editorial reviews of this book that claimed it ws ""brilliant"" and ""enchanting"" I decided to purchase it and dive right it. The premise of the book is unique and that is what drew me to the book. However, the story lines moved slow and were too predictable. The romantic portions seemed to have been writted by a hormonal teenager, and lacked depth. The main characters were colorful, but played as far too idealistic for such a rural setting."
1,Don't waste your time.,Many of the other reviews sum this up - predictable and boring. I was hoping for a quirky read to bridge my transition between some heavier reads. This wasn't even worth that time.
1,BOOORRRING,"I'm sorry, but I found this book totally boring. I mean please. I could stop mid-chapter with no urgent desire to pick the book back up and keep reading. Hmmmm....should've bought the book I really wanted instead of the one with all the hype."
2,Wait for the video,"A very light read, and not all that satisfying. In a word, quaint. In another word, NOVELLA."
1,the literary equivalent of candy corn,"The success of this book might be chalked up to the old axiom how no one ever went broke underestimating the intelligence of the american people.I was drawn to this book by it's title and central premise. TOo bad Ben Sherwood can't write worth a lick.I'm not sure which is more upsetting: how poorly Ben Sherwood writes, or how low our expectations have fallen as readers, given the number of positive reviews this book has received."
4,cute love story,"This is a cute love story. Suspend your disbelief about eating a 747 and you will really enjoy this. The protagonist is a man who sees the world in facts and figures. The female is a woman who sees the big picture. A funny tale of love and how people see it. I had a hard time at first understanding the whole eating of the 747 part, but once I decided it was just a gimmic to show Wally's love for willa, I realized that it didn't matter whether a man could really eat a 747 or not, it wasn't the point. A quick read, enjoy."
3,Silly but cute!,"Don't expect too much and you won't be disappointed. I had heard hype about this book, but after reading the synopsis, it sounded like something I wouldn't like. I checked the Amazon readers reviews. A few people bashed it, but many loved it, so I thought I'd give it a try. I didn't expect much out of it, but it turned out that I liked it. It was cute and silly - a really quick read that held my attention and was nice for a change from the ""heavy"" Oprah books. Really, what can you expect from a title ""The Man Who Ate the 747."""
1,Has there ever been a more banal and cliched book?,"This is such a condesending book about ""Middle America."" The characters seem like the creation of a Harvard undergrad who thinks that mid west rubes are just so darn cute and earthy. Yuck."
3,Weaker than your typical Frommer's guide,"I am a lover of Frommer's guides. In the past I've owned guides for Florida, Arizona, The Carolinas and Spain. So I assumed that this would be a good one. I was partly wrong. It has some beautiful pictures, for sure. But if what you are after is a guide to point you to the off-the-beaten-path places, if you want to drive away from the routes of the tour buses, this is not the right book for you. The tours it recommends are not too different from regular sightseeing experiences, so what's the point of driving the same routes that you can have someone drive for you?If you are the adventurer type, you're much better off getting a copy of the Frommer's Spain book or the Michelin Guide. They will provide you with a wealth of details and tips that will enrich your travel plans."
2,too small,its cute..but too small...and way too expensive for the price.I ordered it for my mom's birthday and had to buy something else for her and keep this for myself.
4,Great!,Wonderful detail. Couldn't put it down once I started reading. The reader has a chance to get to know the characters. Can't wait for more.
3,I'm rating this book a 3-star-plus...,"The first thing I thought when I read this book was that Tony Ruggiero has a very keen idea of how the special ops military really works, and that he uses what he knows about that to great effect in this novel. Through his descriptive prose, he really knows how to put us in Kosovo. It helps us to know how the Kosovars feel about occupying forces; we feel the effects of dust and weather. And we learn about Balkan legends, in this case about vampires. Tony has a great ability to choreograph special military operations, even to the extent that in this novel, they feel ""real"". We see the soldiers' diplomatic- and combat-related concerns. Maybe it's the realism that helps us to see TEAM OF DARKNESS as a different vampire novel; one that, despite its supernatural elements, enthralls us with sumptuous detail that never supplants action."
3,Pretty good,"Beast Machines is certainly not as good as Beast Wars, but it's still good.Half of the episodes are pretty good, some are really good, but the finalbattle between Optimus and Megatron I must say was one of the best episodesof either series. If this had been the first show to come out and then BeastWars came out as a prequel series, that might have worked better. But stillin all, not a bad show."
2,"Not great, but still buyable","The Release date for this item has been officially pushed back to 02/28/06. Although Rhino has been good about getting other TF series out, unfortunately since they are a relatively small distributor, their products suffer from major delays (its been a year since their last relase which was part 1 of Armada).Although this series was mired in philosophical drivel, and the re-writing of the TF universe (presenting an ""organic"" Cybertron which never really existed) I'll still be adding it to my collection as I am a TF animated completist. To be fair, although the series as a whole as a major letdown, there were a couple of individual stories and plot devices which were admiable mentions, since of course they were all taken from the Original TF series."
5,Not nearly as bad as some think,"I admit that I caught up with the hating of this show when it was first on. I decided to buy this dvd because I already have all of G1 and Beast Wars, so I thought I'd complete the collection. Watching it again years later, I realized that BM is actually a really good and insightful show. True, it's much darker than G1 and beast Wars, but that's what gives it depth. None of the characters are perfect, but again their flaws make them worth watching. Cheetor, who I didn't care for at all in BW, has grown up to be a likable character and a decent second-in-command. I especially liked that Optimus was no longer the perfect leader and that while the other Maximals respected him, they thought for themselves. The only thing I was sad to see (as I read many fans were) was the loss of Silverbolt's former charm. I do miss him as a white knight type.Overall though, Beast Machines is not to be missed."
3,The Story is Complete,"Transformers Beast Machines is the complete series (Two seasons, 26 episodes)that follows Optimus Primal and the Maximals after the Beast Wars to the Transformers' home planet of Cybertron. Visually, Beast Machines is the next level up for the people at Mainframe. It looks great and has some really great moments. The plot for the series has Megatron up to no good again, but lacks the great twists that happened at the end of the Beast Wars. To sum it all up, if you like the Transformers (especially Beast Wars), then Beast Machines is a good buy (if you have the spending cash). I got it to complete the Beast Wars/Machines saga in my library. Not as great as Beast Wars, but good in its own right."
5,Simple read,"I am a big fan of Carolyn Brown, found her when I was looking for something to read years ago and got hooked on her writing. So went to Amazon to look up books that aren't available in our small town. This was a good read; sweet romance and a page turner. You can't go wrong with any of her books."
2,Don't Waste Your Money!,"This pack is really Bad! I LOVE attacktix, but this pack is terible! The only good figues are Luke Skywalker, and Megatron. Darth Vader's arm broke, Super Optimus Prime's blast shoots before you press the button, and the battle masters are Pathetic. The Battle Master's point value is 70 each, but they are very easy to kill, and their blasts are very bad.Do yourself a faver, skip this and buy the Star Wars attacktix series 4 starter set."
2,"Um... Ok, but not for serious play","I LOVE Attacktix. This set was a major letdown. I'm sure that beginners would probably like this set, but as a real player, this set stinks. Save your money, the only good figure is Optimus Prime."
3,"Better than the first one, lame for Americans","The English subtitles on this are illegible. Nobu is referred to as ""stretch the man,"" Hachi is called ""Small Loose"" and Nana is either referred to as a blank or as ""name of movie."" Seriously."
2,Did I miss something here?,"Reading all the other rave reviews, I'm left wondering what I missed. For me, this book totally failed to engage me or even make me care about Mandy and what happened to her. I found her treatment shallow and the whole tale somehow lacked real substance. It just never came alive for me. It seemed there could have been so much more yet all we got was surface descriptions."
3,zzzZZZZzzzZZZ,"While this book was very well written, I found the main characters rather unlikeable and the story itself boring."
4,"If you've spent time in NYC or NO, you will enjoy this book.","If you've ever wondered ""Who IS this person? Why are they here?"" while watching a street performer, this book might satisfy your curiosity. I enjoyed the descriptions of life in the ""underworld"" of New York and New Orleans."
4,Fascinating Story and Life,"Her name isn't even Alice and although the title implies a life of fantasy this is anything but! From an oddly close relationship with her estranged father to her search for an orgasm, this book stops along the road of life to examine street performers in both New York and New Orleans.The poverty is abject, the obsession to tap dance compulsive yet there is a charm and adventure to this memoir that would entice anyone to go along for the ride. The colorful cast of characters are real people with personalities that often fit classic stereotypes. This book makes one realize how one can become trapped in a lifestyle joined as a lark by lack of money to get out. I look forward to a sequel to find out when Alice became Mandy and how her life changed dramatically."
2,a major problem,"I needed a new atomic travel clock this one looked good at a good price. it worked as soon as I put in the battery, found what zone I was in, has a very good display and as i am visually impaired that is a very important plus. BUT a big problem ensued as I arise early and it is dark outside I must have a clock that has a very easy to use back-light. all other travel clocks (5 in all) that I have had has a big button someplace usually right under the display to bring up the light. There is no button on this - the little spot on top which says ""press"" does absolutely nothing. so here I was with a clock and no easy back light. I discovered that the light will come on only when i fold the stand that keeps clock up right, this is not very convenient at all. they really mised the boat on such a poor design feature. I would not reccomend this.thanks"
4,Good Customer Service,"The bbs aren't very high quality, and there are better prices on Amazon, but this is extremely high/quality customer service. If you have a problem with your order, they do what it takes to make sure you're satisfied. My order came a little worn and torn due to poor packaging, relayed this info to the seller, and they sent me a new speedloader free of charge, minus the bbs. I would say I am fairly satisfied with this order."
2,Handy but disappointed.,"It's handy to have a VCR and a DVD player in one machine, but when the VCR is on, there's a distinct buzz. When the DVD's on, the volume is ten times louder. Also, the DVD player's ""display"" does not show you how much time is left on whatever you're watching. If you want to know how much time is left on a movie, you'd have to use a little math as it only shows you how much time has elapsed. Especially annoying when you're watching a DVD extra with no idea how long it is. Other than that, I like the remote, I like that in VCR mode you can fast-forward in different speeds, and I like the remote-controlled eject button."
4,Looks Brand New,I purchased this remanufactured deck so I could copy my VCR tapes and an occassional DVD onto my Panasonic DMR=EH50 DVD and hard drive recorder. I am almost finished and the only complaint I have is that when I insert a VCR tape it immediately ejects but accepts them on the second insertion. This is a very minor inconvenience considering the low price I paid for this deck. It looks brand new and smells brand new. It has much more refinement than I expected for the price of it. I have been buying other remanufactured products as well and find this to be a money saving way to acquire quality products.
1,baaaaaaaaaaaad!,"Not a good example of American Contemporary Furniture. So-so examples, not well researched, ho-hum layout, okay photos -- but overall, had to even hunt for the labels for the few items I was interested in. It was a gift; we will keep it in case one of these items comes to us for conservation.NO recomendation.Background: College prof, archeeetect, furniture conservator, and dyslexic typist without spellcheck!"
2,Under The Table,"The content is worth only one star, but there are some nice photos, so I'll concede to two. Most of the book is conjecture, and opinion. There is very little evidence of any research going into this title. Not a single outside source, article or book is cited. I think you can learn more about contemporary American furniture design from browsing eBay furniture auctions or reading furniture store catalogs than reading this book.The only good content is the occasional biography of current designers, and these are few and far between. The books places emphasis on upcoming ""third generation"" designers, but really fails to discuss where they will come from or what is in store for American design.I felt like the editors just wanted to put together a fantasy catalog of items they would like to have in their homes, and the book lacks an altogether purpose.And to top it all off, the design and layout is sub-standard for such a remarkable subject. I don't recommed it to anyone."
2,Rather overworked theme; nothing spectacluar,"I bought this book based on the back blurb, but I think that whoever wrote that description didn't read much more than 2 chapters in. Character development was rather weak (especially for Isabel's mother, on whom the plot should seemingly hinge, vis a vis her daughter), and the timeline of events is somewhat chopped up because of the great jumps in time between each section of the book. Basically, there are other stories of this ilk that have been written better, and you wouldn't miss much by passing up this book."
1,"This ""Tea"" is too weak for for me!","While this book has gotten some strong regonition and kudos in the community it did nothing for me. The book is more character than plot driven, and the characters are not that interesting! I really thought this book would focus more on Isabel and her relationship whith her mother as she relects back on her time spent with her as she grows up. And how that relationship shapes her adult life as a lesbian. Her mother's death should be a catlyst but is a rather flat, useless side note. I kept expecting this book to take off like a rocket but it keeps plodding along like a farm tractor on a empty field. In the end, this book left me more frustrated and angry over the time I wasted on it."
2,mediocre read,Quick read. Though not particularly memorable. Especially the ending. I picked it up to finish it ... only to realize I had finished it the night before. Oops.
2,I want my time back!,"I would love to have back the time I spent reading this book, but that is the risk we take when choosing a novel. I found myself wanting to toss it after a chapter or two, but kept on because I was on vacation and too lazy to pick another book. I kept hoping Isabel would grow up and redeem herself or at least grow up, but she remained a shallow, unpleasant character in a shallow, boring book with a weak, unsatisfying ending. The best I can say for this novel is that it was mercifully short!"
2,"Poor pictures, limited information, poorly organized","This book is not very great at all. It only shows 1 small picture of each car from one angle (so you're always missing some part of the car like the front or back). Then it really doesn't have that much information on each car, just maybe 1/3 of a page, and finially the selection and organization is not very good either. I would really recommend looking elsewhere for a good book on exotic cars and supercars or anything else. What I would really recommend though now that we're on the subject is buying an exotic car. I think I would most recommend a Ferrari F430, and then maybe a Porsche Turbo or Lamborghini Gallardo... I would love some comments left on what supercar you would like most to have...of ANY car, if I had the money...probably a McClaren F1 or maybe a Koneinsegg (spelling?).Take care and good luck shopping.Sam Kochel: STi owner"
5,The Cars You Dreamed About,"Cars of the Super Rich (subtitled The Opulent, the Original and the Outrageous) is not just another book with the latest expensive exotic cars for those of us who haven't outgrown our adolescent fantasy cars. This book from Motorbooks International is looking to put the specialty and exotic car in its historical context. Thus, in addition to the McLaren F1s, Bugatti EB110s, and Ferrari Enzos, you will also find the desirable cars of times past such as the Bugatti Royale, the Deusenberg SJ, and the Aston Martin DB4 GT Zagato. In addition to the historical context, you'll also find some intersting diversions into the luxury cars of Communist Russia and China (the Chaika-Gaz 13 and the Honq Qi) and a fascinating chapter entitled ""Call the Taste Police"", where such worthy vehicles as the Excalibur, the Panther De Ville, and the Stutz Blackhawk of 1970 reside. For both fans of auto history and those who love the 200 mile per hour club."
3,So so,"This was a okay time killer I had to remind my self to read it, it didn't inspire any particular sense of urgency or loyalty it wasn't awful but it was a little immature maybe it should be sold in the kids fiction section."
2,Turn of the century hog-wash,"Although the book has a couple of entries that are interesting as well as historical, the majority of the book is a waste of time."
1,"Dated, Error-Laden, and Useless","I abandoned this book after chapter 4 because of the plethora of errors: typos in the text and errors in the Excel models. The book came with an old 3""x3"" ""floppy"" and was written using Excel 97. The website for the book is inactive. The more serious problem, however, was that the book does not use VBA for modeling, thus making the spreadsheets needlessly cumbersome.Far better to learn elementary derivatives modeling in Excel would be Rees's Financial Modeling in Practice (2010) and Staunton & Jackson's Advanced Modelling in Finance Using Excel and VBA (2001). The latter suffers from a slight drawback of using Excel 2003, so the macros won't open in Excel 2007. However, you can either use a hot patch from Microsoft's website or (better yet) recreate the macros from scratch yourself."
1,Just the facts.. and little else,"The book provides good reference information with regard to the basic price/yield equations, but John Martin gives short shrift to any discussion of the finance theory behind them. It is not just an academic issue since many instruments will trade a premium or discount to the prices implied by the basic equations.Go with the classic: Options, Futures, and Other Derivatives (5th Edition) -- by John C. Hull."
4,Decent machine,"The Good; Very solid machine, seems to roll smooth with little noise, basically exactly what a person would expect and want from a hip sled.The Bad; Very tight compact area for sliding on weights, the 45# plates are a tight fit just barely clearing the top rail when sliding on/off, The third post for weights protrudes out the back of the framework when you workout so you can't put the machine up close to a wall, need to leave it away from the wall about 1 foot. The back pad kinda just sits on the low medal plate so when you get on and off the machine it tends to flip up because it is not fully supported.All things considered this is a very good choice of machine. They make a slightly less expensive model by same company that appears would be a much better machine if it had the same roller system. I read a review on that one and it appears that one may not roll as niecely thats why I went with this one and I have no complaints about that aspect with this machine."
4,Direct Action views nonviolent movement power dynamics,Reading Direct Action gave me a new perspective on just how much struggle was involved in the structural form of the lead Bay Area anti-nuke group of the early 80's that provided a spring board for so many great creative and inspirational actions against nuclear power and weapons and other issues. It was a great time in my life and seeing its affect on others in the book brings back the best of it for me.
5,One of the Best Activist Novels I've Read In A While,"During the aftermath of Hurricane Charley, I read this novel by flashlight and I couldn't put it down. Luke Hauser does an excellent job of telling the history of the anti-nuclear movement of the early 1980's. I definitely recommend this book for all environmental, peace and social justice activists. Besides being highly informative and inspiring, it is a gripping read!"
5,Great kit,"After much deliberation, I purchased this kit for my 2001 Tahoe LS. Kit arrived completely as described. Another reviewer stated that you need the Moog Camber kit however, this is untrue. The stock camber adjustments on the tahoe will work just fine. The trick is to remove the camber ""governor stops"". With the plastic clips removed, and the kit installed, the tahoe aligned perfectly with no toe-in, and a 0.02 camber on both wheels. I currently have 22"" ASA BBS wheels on the truck with Pirelli P-Zero tires. This kit is just what I needed. Not too low, and no rubbing at all with 22""s."
5,"Great Movie, Very Interesting","The China Syndrome takes place the same year that it's filmed, 1979. It is most famous for unknowingly predicting that a nuclear accident would happen at Three Mile Island, (which actually did occur, shortly after this movie was released.) That's what makes it interesting is that, this movie tells a situation in which the plant would have a meltdown, and, shortly after being released in 1979, a real nuclear meltdown happens at the plant. Very amazing, and I would very much recommend this movie."
4,Three Mile Island: A Warning,"This movie came out a year before the incident at Three Mile Island but it is freakishly alike.A news-reporter is making an item at a nuclear power plant and sees an incident happening right before her eyes. The camerman (Michael Douglas) tapes it all and gives to tape to the anti-nuclear people.First the corperation does not want to come out and says nothing has happened. One of the people working at the plant (Jack Lemmon) get regrets and wants to come out. The movie has it's highpoint in the end, in the contral room of the plant...It is a very important movie to show to people the dangers of nuclear power plants and especially the role of human error. Still topical after 25 years, a must-see"
1,Terrible,Imagine a bad SciFi dream with all the unlogic associated with dreams written down and published as a book and you will have an idea of what this book is like. The charactors aren't well done and the characters which were well done in the first book when they finaly show up in this one aren't at all the same.
1,Should be negative 5 stars,"And I thought ""Warp Speed"" was bad! Again - stupid plot, caricatures not characters, and the technology was just plain wrong. Let's hope he's not planning on a triology."
4,Perfection,It was on the radio while out to dinner. Made it a memorable night. Could not find the CD in the US. Available as an import only but well worth the effort.
3,NO corded operation,"Trimmer works well, but is does NOT allow corded operation, so when the rechargeable battery runs low or eventually won't charge well anymore, you are out of luck."
4,Great rings,"strong and hold zero perfect as long as you use a wrench to tighten the bolts. 308 + knocks them loose if it is finger tightened, but that is hardly an issue as once you have it where you want you will be tightening it anyways.Only complain is that i should have ordered the high rings."

2,For the price its ok.,Got it for my wife. I payed it under 50$ and for that price I guess its ok. Leather its not that great quality.
5,Cool!,I bought this watch for my 15 years old daugher. She is pretty picky. I was kind of worried...but she loved it as soon as she opened it. She wears it every day and turns watch's straps to match her jacket color. It's a cool watch for girls!
4,Tommy Hilfiger reversible watch,"This is a very nice looking watch. The only problem I have with it is that my wrist is small and I have it on the last hook and it doesn't stay in the center of my wrist. However, I do like it."
2,Not so fancy,"It's colors are not that great as shown on picture. It seens like left under sunlight. It's very tiny too, more than It seens."
2,Fast delivery but crappy packaging !!!,The delivery was timely and the watch seems to be OK. Surprisingly I found that the packaging was damaged and it was crystal clear that the seller knew about this and still sent the product as is to the customer!! This is unacceptable from Amazon.. The only reason that I won't return the item is that I need to offer shortly this watch as a gift to my friend's wife who I know will not comment a lot on the packaging.
3,great watch,i got this watch from a good fried who knows how i love watches...nice elegant look and nice color...I love the fact that its reversible so I could wear the smae watch with different looks each day....it feels good in my wrist and i know that it looks good as well:)
1,watch is horrible,first of all the watch was not shipped to my home like it was suppose to be. It was sent to the UPS office and we got no notification of that. So the product was there the 6th and we did not know about it. So eneded picking it up on the 13 and wore the watch for 2days and then it stopped working. Horrible product don't know if it is a fake or original. Really Pissed! oh and bought it new not used.
3,Good Watch,"Good watch for a affordable price, My only complaint is the strap is very loose and does not stay intact, Some times it changes automatically from blue to red."
5,Lovely watch!!,I bought this for my wife and she is in love with it. The band is so easy to reverse and both sides look great!! I wish they had more colors of the band.
4,Highly Recommended...,Fantastic watch.. My friend and I ordered the watch togethernad received it within 3-4 days. We were very excited since you can wear it in 3 different ways.. 3-in-1 for a decent price. Definitely a good deal!
4,Good enough!,It arrived about 2 days earlier than the estimated delivery date.It looks good except that the navy color is much darker than it seems. It is more like black.
4,Cute!,This is one of the many watched i have and I love it....u can wear it either ways blue r red....else wear it half and half just to make it look sexier....
1,Watch didn't work!,"When you spend 50 dollars on a watch you would expect it to have a working battery. Very disappointing! The watch itself is a bit flimsy. The strap buckle is not attached so it doesn't stay in place. Saw this in duty free magazine on plane, was listed for $75. Checked around for cheaper price--not worth it! Am going to return!"
2,Don't bother,"I opted to purchase this after reading the reviews and thinking...well, some people like them. Wrong choice.My hair usually curls so tight with my old hot rollers that I thought that these bigger ones would give my hair more body than curl. Well, after using them twice, I look more like I tried to flat iron my hair and failed.I've never returned a product before, but think these are going back."
3,Not for long hair,"I would not recommend these rollers to anyone with long hair. After attempting to use these rollers for a formal event, I resorted to using a curling iron."
2,conair 5s7n jumbo rollers instant heat travel hairsetter,"I keep my heat down to save on heating bills, but still I couldn't believe that it would take about 30 to 45 minutes for these to heat up good enough to put a curl or body in anyone's hair. my own hair is not fine or very thick and usually takes a curl. I owned a set before and loved them, but maybe I just got a set that didn't work very good."
2,Disappointed,"Bought these to augment an existing set of Conair rollers with 4 jumbos (the only size I use), 8 med-lg rollers and unwieldy clips that randomly spring off my head and launch in different directions.Turns out, these are the same size rollers as the smaller, superfluous ones I already own and the clips, though better-behaved than the originals, leave nasty creases in my hair. Even worse, the unit was designed without an on/off switch. The instructions actually say to pull the plug out when you are finished. This seems to contradict conventional thinking that it is risky or perhaps even dangerous to yank a plug out of a socket before turning the appliance off.Ultimately, I felt compelled to give the Conair TS7N two stars because it takes up very little space and the rollers heat up quickly."
3,hot rollers-- 5 pack,disappointed-- they aren't soft as they appear. They heat almost instantly but don't stay in short hair with the clips provided.
3,Need more!,"I have thick, long hair and a lot of it. I wish they made a larger set of these rollers. They take a little longer than I would like to get super hot. I never have much luck with rollers....So it may just be me."
3,Great,"These hot rollers are very good. I just thought initially that 5 rollers would do the trick. Unfortunately when your hair is down your back AND thick, you are going to need more than 5 hot rollers. I'll likely just be ordering another set of the exact same kind, though!"
2,not thrilled,"I bought these to replace my hot rollers from 1994, which were still working, but took up too much room on my bathroom vanity. I expected an improved product considering the age of my previous rollers, and I truly believe my previous rollers (circa 1994) work better. It seems like I need to leave these in longer, maybe because of the spongy material on the roller (my previous ones were plastic). the butterfly clips don't work. I still had metal pins from my previous set so I can use those. The only thing I like about these is the size. I will likely look for others...."
1,"They could be ""heating"" forever and still not get hot.","I used to own a newer version of these curlers, and those were fantastic. When mine broke, I bought these. What a mistake! These do NOT get hot no matter how long you leave them plugged, and they still come with the terrible clips instead of normal metal holders. The clips leave marks on your hair, hold the curlers poorly, and were replaced by Conair in later models of this product. Do NOT buy these! Oh, and they're also terrible for travel. The size is good for a sink, not a suitcase."
3,Good,"Love the size of the rollers. Just what you need for long hair. While this is a ""travel"" hairsetter, the company should make a set with 10 Rollers (all jumbo size) as I had to purchase 2 sets for everyday use. The cover is terrible. Pretty much guaranteed, the cover will crack within 6 months of use. I'm already on my third set and when you call or write -- you dont get any response for replacement or with any solution. Just have to buy a new one. I'm alredy on my third set. Not good!"
3,"Not great, but good","This worked well in the U.S. on the 120 setting, but when I took it to Kenya and switched it to the 240 setting, it wouldn't heat. I had to switch it back to the 120 setting and plug it into a converter.I didn't like that it comes with big plastic hinged clips instead of the thin, curved metal pins like most hot rollers. That fat bag of plastic clips takes up almost as much room as the rollers. For something that's supposed to be for travel, that's a bad feature.Bottom line, I'll keep it and use it for travel in the U.S., but won't take it overseas again."
5,Great rollers,"These are the best. I have long very thick straight hair, and I truly enjoy the set. It is quick and easy. All I do is wait 2-5 minutes for the rollers to heat and have them in my hair between 5-15 depending on how much i want the curls to last me, and I am off to work. I would definetely recommended to people."
4,good product,"this is the latest version of a product i have used for years. travel curlers used to be more compact, lined up in a row. that changed into a much bulkier oval case i suspect to accommodate flocked rollers that are heated more safely and MUCH less likly to burn. the rollers are also slightly smaller and big clips are used which can not be carried in the roller case,a hassle for storage and travel. i've saved the old roller pins to use instead and i think they can be ordered separately. this is a good product, heats fast and the flocked rollers are safe for your fingers and easier on your hair."
5,greatest little hairsetter going!,"This is the second time I have purchased this hairsetter because I actually wore the first one out! I also have the full sized model. It heats up quickly and makes either a smooth finish if you leave them in for just a brief minute or two, or if you leave them in until they cool they make a lovely curl to my thick, long and wirey hair. I've tried lots of hairsetter models over the years and this one is definitely the best. It has the largest rollers of all the setters and never tangles your hair."
4,5 Jumbo Clips included,"I ordered a 10 set of jumbo clips seperate, cuz i dind't know they were included in the package.But you can't really complain for getting more."
2,Clips leave creases,"These rollers are 1.5"" thick and are too large for my thin, straight, long hair. They don't curl my hair enough. They do add volume and make my ends curly but I wanted a bit more curl. The deal-breaker is the clips though. They hold the hair well, but the creases look horrible. I end up throwing my hair up into a ponytail just to hide the creases...what is the point of that!? I will be returning these."
3,"great rollers, bad for travel","i really like these rollers and have a larger set for home use. purchased these for travel -- i travel for work several times a month and despite a good suitcase, the base, the lid, and most parts of the exterior break, crack, etc. this product needs a redesign for travel."
2,Certainly Not Instant Heat and not Really Much Heat At All,"I bought this set to replace a set of jumbo rollers by BabyBliss. The case looks identical and the rollers are exactly the same. However, these rollers take about 10 minutes to fully heat and never really get hot enough. The plastic clips don't hold my hair very well and are too bulky to pack in a suitcase. If I had it to do over again, I wouldn't purcahse these rollers."
3,could be better designed,"The curlers heat well and work fine, but the design of the unit could be MUCH better.First, they sent huge hinged clips for the curlers, rather than the small metal U-clips. The unit has a little ""well"" or pocket to store the U-clips, but no such clips are provided. The big clips are very bulky for travel, and there is no pouch, pocket, or container to store them in.Second, the unit has a pedestal, which creates another 30 cubic inches of wasted space when packing. I'd rather have just the compact heating base without the pedestal design.Third, the unit is brittle plastic that is not shock-resistant and will crack easily. I could imagine a much better casing designed for travel.Last, there is no on/off switch so you have unplug and replug the unit with each use, which is a pain."
1,not hot,"I have thin, medium length hair. This product does not get hot enough hold curls, regardless of the amount of time I let it heat up. What a waste of money."
1,burned out!,"I bought these rollers in June, and I have used them roughly two or three times a month since then. Today I put switched them on - and the rollers burned out, melting the surrounding plastic and singeing the lid. They were on for no more than 5 minutes. Three of the rollers were literally molten - and I have now chucked the set away. One of the reasons I used them so infrequently was that the curlers got so hot that I found it hard to handle them without burning myself. I am hoping these were just duds, because I have just bought the larger Conair jumbo roller set."
1,It didn't work for me,This is terrible. I didn't like the out come at all. It does not heat up enough. Noting special. The roller is only 5 so i ordered more 5 roller. But the problem is it's not good result.
5,Perfect Hot Rollers,"These are the best hot rollers I have ever had. They heat up fast and smooth out the waves and frizzies. I like how they're so big, they don't make my hair too curly, just smoooooth."
2,Definitely not hot,"I own the full size version of these rollers as well, and the travel size does not get even half as hot as the full size set, even if you let it heat up longer.However, there aren't any other travel size roller sets out there that provide jumbo size rollers, so if you don't mind just getting a wave, rather than curl, then this is your best bet."
3,Not for me,"I have very thick hair and there were not enough rollers. I wasn't trying to do all my hair just some. There is nothing wrong with these, they are definitely compact and easy to use they just weren't great if you have thick hair and a lot of it. You would probably need at least 10 rollers."
4,Great results,"I've used these rollers for years with great results on my long to medium length hair, and just finally getting my second set. The originals are still working but the velvet is wearing thin and I was afraid they wouldn't still be available when I finally did need them. The one thing I don't like about them is the bulkiness of the clips when traveling."
3,Not Quite Perfect,Five rollers isn't enough for me and I don't have a lot of hair. Two more rollers would have been perfect. Also the clips that come with this left weird marks in my hair. I plan to order some of the wire u-shaped curler holders since these don't work very well. The rollers heat up really fast which is nice since I had to put a few back in to reheat and use again.
1,Never get this cage,"If you dont already know, you CANNOT put hamsters in round cages.Hamsters use corners as landmarks and they go crazy if you put them in round cages"
5,A Must,"I love the words, the illustrations, the positive tone of this wonderful book! I recommend it to anyone who has children or simply wants an occasional feel good moment."
4,A Nice Collection,"These are not some of John Wayne's greatest films. However, all of them are fun to watch and come late enough in his career that he is relaxed and great in his own way. The fight scene in North to Alaska alone took thousands of gallons of beer and was a classic."
5,This lady can sing.,"All can add to what has already been said is that I also heard her music on ""Cadillac Records"". Not only did the music move me, but I thought Beyonce did one hell of a job.I just finished watching ""Cadillac Records"" for the umpteenth time, and finally bought this CD. What took me so long?"
4,Great CD for Etta James fans,This Etta James CD should satisfy the true Etta James fan. Most of her well known and memorable songs are included.
1,Perfect for the price and my minimal ironing needs - EDITED,"I purchased this item off of Amazon simply because it was the cheapest iron on the site, and I was a little bit nervous about the quality but I received it and I've used it on cotton fabric a few times and it's perfect! It heats up in (literally) 3 seconds and the steam is great, reliable and even. I have only ever used it on cotton, I would be a bit nervous to use it on something expensive and delicate, not because the quality is bad, just because it was the least expensive iron on the site. If you don't need to do a lot of ironing, or don't iron anything too delicate very often and you're on a budget, you can not go wrong with this iron!EDIT NOTE: I don't use this iron anymore. It burned a few of my hubby's EXPENSIVE white collared button-up shirts even on the LOWEST setting... would NOT recommend!!!"
4,Practice makes perfect,This is a useful workbook to help you fine-tune your French. Textbooks usually don't have enough exercises to help cement rudimentary concepts. A must buy.
3,color was not accurately copied,"I ordered a pair of Quarry Leather. But the color was totally different with what was showed here.It's actually a very comfortable pair of shoes either for dress or for office suit, the shipping is well packed and fast.veronia"
2,Running to the bookshelf,"This is what I did immediately after finishing this book--to look for a decent read. This was the kind of book that had me wondering, during the entire thing: when will it get better? And it never did. Katz over-describes every little thing that happened to him, in a dramatic style, that had me saying over and over to myself ""I can't believe he thinks this is so important."" I was expecting a deep, philosophical book which would really make me think and do some self-reflecting--I got none of this."
1,Maddening,"A work of supreme self-indulgence. Katz needs to re-read the 7 Story Mountain, then take a look at Augustine's Confessions and Dorothy Day's Long Lonelines, and see what was really at stake for these great seekers. A vague ""quest for the spiritual"" is doomed to self-absorbed circularity which may be fascinating to the subject but is dull to the outsider. The spiritual seeker looks for truth, not mere peace of mind, because he or she realizes that the essential question being asked is ""why am I here and what am I supposed to do with this life?"" and the answers to that are not found in the self, but in the One who brought the Self into being. The reviewer below is right. You can't divorce spirituality from theology. Besides the Christians I mentioned above, Katz might take a look at the Buddhist thinkers before he runs away again: ""Whereever you go, there you are."""
1,I'm going back to Henry David,"And I thought this would be the 21st Century version of Walden Pond. Big mistake. 17 pages of this poorly written, pointless narrative is all I took. And mind you, this is only the second book in my life that I have failed to finish after starting. And that includes Scarface. Terrible! How this guy has been published several times is a puzzle."
2,Middle age??,"How do people get off saying ""middle age crisis"" at 50? Life won't last till 100 for most of us....38-42 is the middle folks! I see no value in having a play house at 50. Or buying this book."
4,Fun Read,"I read this book for my book club. It was entertaining and an easy read.It bothered me somewhat that a man of 50 was still ""looking for himself""especially since he was married and had a child. He had to buy a rundowncabin in upstate New York to ""find himself"". This struck me as rather selfishsince his primary home with his family was in major disrepair. Would Irecommend this book? I suppose so but ""Following Atticus"" was a better book!"
3,Katz grew up,"Our book club had mixed feelings about Katz writings. At one point he was too self-centered, but we were glad he found himself and matured, finding peace in the moment!"
4,"Love Jon Katz, not but not this book","When I was about 100 pages into this book, the thought struck me. All the almost all ""getting away, discovering true self"" books are all written by men. The women stay behind, keeping the home fires burning and the bills paid. I enjoyed this book once I got over the inequity of the whole ""getting away"" situation. Jon Katz has a gift for capturing the emotions of everyday struggle, complete with the absurdities of many of the things we do. His tale of discovering the ramshackle cabin and reclaiming it from the mice and encroaching forests brings a smile to anyone who has lived in a ""fixer upper"". He eventually blends into the local culture and weaves the people who inhabit the town into the book. It does tend to get a bit bogged down with Thomas Merton references (I am not a huge fan). When Katz deals with the reclamation of the cabin and the people who populate his world, he is at his best"
2,Run away to the mountain...What? There's no computer or TV!,"I did not enjoy this book much. After watching the author explain his sabitical, I ran for my computer to get the book ordered. A week later after my book arrived and had been read I was let down. This was not a sabitical or a spiritual retreat this was running away from responsibility. After some time in his mountain cabin he didn't miss his family as much as he missed his computer, email, internet and cable TV. I think this was a writer just trying to write a book on a given subject with a deadline, not someone who is compassionate for the inner truth."
3,One can't separate Merton from his faith,"I was disappointed at the author's glib assumption assumption -- so common among boomers seeking ""spirituality"" -- that he could pluck from Merton various self-help aids but ignore Merton's Catholic faith. I was reminded of ""Cloister Walk,"" in which the author appeared to want the benefits of being a devout Christian mystic without actually being one. Aging boomers, relucant to explore and actually engage traditional religion, often pull the New Age trick of pulling what strikes them as meaningful from the works of religious writers from all sorts of diverse traditions (see, e.g., the interest in Jewish Kabbalah by Hollywood stars!). I for one am not impressed by such ""cafeteria spirituality,"" and I'm not sure Merton would be either. That said, the writing is wonderful, and the author's tone is not at all off-putting."
5,"Wit, wisdom and a good read","A nice blend of inspiration, insight and entertainment. As a fellow 50+ soul searcher I really enjoyed Mr. Katz's wise look at mid-life challenges and opportunities. Thanks for this book."
1,To sappy and long winded for me,"I approached this book hoping for an interesting read and maybe some inspirational tidbits. I was disappointed. This book is about a self centered man who had a bad childhood, poor marriage and priorties that are way off base. I kept waiting for something to happen. It never did."
4,An affirmation of life,"When you get down to it, Katz is trying to live a better life, and that's a pretty universal goal. That he expresses that so warmly, humorously and movingly is just another bonus. Great read."
2,I don't think so.,I don't think all these songs are the one-hit wonder. There're so many songs in the list have sung by the artist who still have push their records to the market today.
3,relax people,This is a Dutch compilation. Therefore the references to one hit wonders would be according to Netherlands charts.
1,One Hit Wonders,"I was so disappointed with this box of CDs! I did not think that the ""hits"" were hits at all! I hardly recognized most of the songs from 1970 up to now! They were NOT hits in my opinion! I went from one CD to the next in shock and disappointment. I would not recommend this, nor would I have purchased this if I had known."
4,Courage,"For those who have experience of horrific abuse, you know the courage that it takes to make yourself, after so many years, visible. Even more, to make visible the wounds that needed healing (and are sometimes still healing). Poetry suits survivor's literature so well because the experience of child abuse does not come in solid, grown-up language. Instead the healing language of survivors comes in fits and starts, images and sensations. Take the time to really read every word in this book, every word. There is powerful courage behind this endeavor.I know this to be true as in writing ""Length of Light"" (pub. 12/21/11 Deborah L. Weaver) I also walked that painful stride that reveals what has been invisible for so long. I recommend this book not just to other survivors, but to those who want to understand and find bridges of empathy for those who have been victims."
2,Not as Pictured,"Did not receive the Hair Spray can as pictured with the multiple S+, which is the older version that I wanted. Apparently the formula has been changed -- it is junk now, doesn't hold hair at all. Wasted money as can't be returned because it is flammable. Did receive in a timely manner."
2,Not as good as their other CD'S!,I really like the music of Shanti Shanti. But this is one to pass on. It is a departure that is not nearly as inspiring.
5,The Singer was the Best Part!!!!,"I don't know where Graciela got her voice from, maybe from Heaven. I should know because i live in Mexico, and get to hear her music ALL theee time. Graciela is great singer she deserve to make alot of albums. i heard she will keep making more. and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more. Just know- Graciela has a beautiful voice"
1,The Band is great!!.......,"But the voice, is very dissapointing. When the music begins, it sounds nice. Then, suddenly an ear-hurting voice begins to sing. The song lyrics are very nice. If another artist would have recorded it, It would be a better CD. But for now, don't waste your money!!!"
1,I thought the band was great!!,The band was great so the one star goes for them. As for Graciela..she wishes she could sing as great as she thinks she does!!!
5,Great teeth cleaner,Would have liked to know the package contained 100 chew sticks rather than the packages of 20 I received in the past!
3,Beautiful but $$$$,It's a beautiful piece but I'm not sure it's worth the money. I bought it for a Christmas Rob Your Neighbor game with the intentions of winning it for myself. Unfortunately I didn't win it but it's not something I can justify spending the money on to buy one for myself.
3,Dry Ry,This is pretty good survey of biblical doctrine with some new ideas in it. Don't expect much and you won't be let down ;)
2,There are much better surveys...,"This was required reading for a Bible class I took. It was OK, but Ryrie is a dispensationalist, cessationist, and occasionally anti-nomian. The book is well written and easy to follow, but I still must pick up a pair of those ""secret decoding eschatology glasses"" so I can understand the premillenial madness suggested by dispensationalists... start with Revelation and go backward? For better doctrine I would recommend Wayne Grudem's ""Bible Doctrine"" or Bruce Milne's ""Know the Truth"", or even ""Concise Theology"" by JI Packer."
4,Engaging Story and Practical Guide,"If you are thinking of living abroad with your children, there are two compelling reasons to read this book. First, the author shares his and his family's real-life experiences, both good and bad. He reminds us that life anywhere is just that -- life, complete with victories and accomplishments, as well as mistakes and disappointments. His entertaining story of their year in Prague helped replace some of my romantic notions with visions of reality. I now feel more prepared to face the challenges of life abroad if and when we decide to ""live outside the borders."" The other reason to buy this book is its wealth of resources and practical tips. Although the organization was at times scattered, the appendices help to make up for this."
4,Another Good book by Osprey Publishing,The book P-40 Warhawk Aces of the CBI goes into great deal with the AVG (American Volunteer Group) early battles with the Japanese fighters and bombers in early 1941 through to 1944. The colour plates of the P-40s are well detailed adn the archival photos and uniforms also bring the book to life. This book also interviews many of the aces of the AVG and show explicit deatil of aerial combat over china
5,Shaver cleaner that works,"I cannot find the Braun shaver cleaner any longer, so I am using this. It works just about as well and is cheaper."
3,electric shaver lubricant,Spray cans of lubricant could use a straw in the nozzle to direct the spray to a small area. Other lubricants like WD-40 have such spray straws.
4,Shick Shaver Saver,I have been using this product for years. Now if find that CVS purchased Longs Drug Stores and CVS no longer is carrying this product. Neither is Rite Aid or Walgreens. This was the only way I could get this product and I am delighted that I can still get it.
3,Adequate,"Adequate is the best term to use I suppose. The button doesn't work great, but it is ok. The slick feel to the exterior doesn't look or feel as nice as the Canon version, but it is so much cheaper, most people won't mind. But it certainly does it's job and is a good value."
2,Dead on Arrival,"Looks nice. Unfortunately did not power up the camera, so I can't say much else. Going to cost me return shipping at the very least. Sorry I didn't buy the Canon product instead."
5,A Must Have /Same as Canon Version,"I have both the Canon version of the grip and this version. They are identical. I have two Rebel XTs and they work great. I like them for the feel it gives holding the camera. The camera was small in my hands and this makes it perfect. If you are thinking of buying accessories for the Rebel XT, this should be one of them. The grip holds two batteries, which gives you way more shooting time. I highly recommend this!"
1,Batteries lose charge quickly - Grip causes issues as well.,"First and foremost, the batteries are junk. Original OEM Canon batteries will let me shot 5x to 10x longer than these. Even with a full charge. At one point, I had them charged in my bag, went to use them the next day, and got about 5 shots off before the battery died. Unacceptable. I ended up just throwing them away.Second, the grip itself. I have only had one chance to use it on a photoshoot, and after a few dozen shots, I was getting a low battery reading. I was using original Canon batteries. I pulled out one of the batteries, put it directly in the camera, and shot for the rest of the day on it.All and all, I am not the least be impressed with Opteka.Good luck."
5,Own a Rebel Xti? GET THIS BATTERY GRIP!,"I recently purchased a Canon Rebel Xti and I have been keeping my eye on the Opteka Battery Grip. I heard nothing but great things about it plus, it came with 2 extra batteries so I thought I could not lose.The battery grip makes a world of difference. The Xti seems a little awkward to hold specially if you have large hands. Once the grip was attached, I thought of why I did not get it when I first purchased my camera. Installation is way too easy. I charged the batteries in less than 2 hours and I was off to go. So far, I have gone about 2 weeks and the battery life meter is still showing full.As far as the quality, I cannot compare it to the Canon grip because I have yet to see/feel one but from the other reviews I have read, there is little to no difference.I read in one review that the vertical shutter button feels a little mushy. Not to me. It does the job in fact, all of the buttons on the grip to their job.I absolutely recommend this product!"
5,GRAT VALUE,I take pictures for my work and at sporting events and as such there are a great many pictures and the single battery would keep giving out. In looking to buy additional batteries I came accross the battery pack grip. Well the cost of 2 batteries was almost as much as this Opteka battery pack grip with 2 batteries! Not to mention that the Canon battery pack grip was significantly more than the Opteka WITHOUT ANY batteries.The Opteka has been in use for over a month and it is just great.I would definitely recommend it to anyone.
5,Great addition,"I bought this a couple of weeks ago and can honestly say that it is the best purchase I've made for my camera so far. Before buying this, I didn't take many vertical shots. Now I take quite a few more. The extra shooting time from two batteries is also a very nice addition. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a battery grip."
2,"Good price, lousy performance","I bought this product a couple weeks ago and at first it seemed fine, but then I noticed that when it was turned on, the control wheel becomes uni-directional. What I mean by this is no matter which way you turn the wheel, the control only scrolls in one direction. This is OK, but frustrating, for some things like ISO and white balance, but it makes the exposure compensation wheel useless. It only moves in the negative direction and once it reaches -2, it is stuck there and will not come back up. This is true whether using the control wheel on the camera or the one on the grip. I am hoping I can return it and if so, will spend the extra $$ to get a Canon grip."
1,Flawed and hazardous,"I tested these batteries after buying two of them and the Thermistor that should be giving the charger the battery temperature for safety has been replaced with a ~10k resistor.(Check your packs yourself, touch a multimeter set to measure ohms to the - and the T terminals, it should be 15k if the battery is freezing and down to 5k if the battery is hot)I consider this hazardous. I do not recommend these to anyone.(The grip however is probably fine, this review is simply about the batteries)"
4,This Grip Rocks!!!,"I bought this grip over the Canon grip to save money. I was a little hesitant at first but I went ahead to took the leap. I am so glad I did! This grip from Opteka fits very snug onto my Rebel XTI. Its lines are awesome and the shutter button function great! I charged this battery pack when I first got it and have shot about 1000 pics on a recent shoot, before needing to charge it up. That includes some review of images on the camera as well. This grip is a home run in my book. Well worth every penny and the build quality is equal to or maybe even more than Canons but for way less money. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a great grip!Thank you,John BeckerBig Dawg Photography"
4,"Good stuff, perfect fit.","This grip is fantastic. Makes my XTi easier to manage in terms of taking portrait shots and the fact that there are TWO higher-capacity batteries is great. We keep the stock battery charged up as a spare. You can use this grip with one or both battery compartments taken up - which is great for when you fall back to a spare battery - you don't need two of them. My only complaint (and hence, 4 stars) is that the wrapped, textured material didn't stick well to the plastic, some superglue cleared this right up, but what do you expect for something that's a fraction of the price of a canon-branded device."
4,First Impression...,"I got my set a couple of days ago. It fits well on my XTi. I tried out all switches; works well on first try. What stands out is the weight, which was expected. There will be some situations that need us to carry this weight around. At other times, I feel that just having those two batteries handy will help. I am yet to see how long they last, against what was claimed. That will tell me how useful the piece is."
5,Perfect fit,"Fits perfectly....works well. Well built. Adds some weight to the camera, of course, but is well balanced."
3,Tad bit disappointed. Expected more from such great reviews.,"I've read so many reviews on how great this item is and for the cost. Personally, I didn't buy this item for the batteries. I bought it for the grip.Pros:Built close to Canon grip.Nice to have slip resistant grip.Extra batteries area always nice to have.Cons:Controls (wheel+buttons) feel like their going to break if I use them.Buttons work, intermittently. One doesn't even work at all.Price. If all you want is to beef up your camera body, you can buy a similar item for half the cost of the Opteka.I've never owned a true Canon grip so I am basing my review off the camera body controls. Honesly, I wouldn't buy this again. Yeah, I've fattened my body but the controls are nearly worthless. I don't use them anyways so I can't complain too much. But hey, at least I won't run out of batteries =)"
5,Work out great with my CANON XT,If you are the person who don't care about brand name but want to have something that also compatible with Canon XT. I think this product is working perfect.
4,Opteka Battery Pack Grip for Canon EOS Digital Rebel,This is a great product for the price 100% satisfied with the grip but the battery quality is a little poor thats why the 4 stars.The single battery that came with my Rebel xt lasts as long as the two put together that came with the grip.If i ever need another grip i would probebly purchase this brand even with the poor batteries.Take away the batteries and its still a good price.
5,Make the XTI so much easier to work with,"When I ordered my Canon xti two months ago I almost sent the camera back. For me the camera body is just too small and I find it way too cramped for my hands. After reading the reviews on this battery pack I ordered it and the difference in how the camera feels in my hands and balances with larger lenses is night and day. This is absolutely the best accessory purchase I've made for my Canon.The grip fits the camera very well. It has a good quality built. I had my camera in at the shop recently trying a new lens and for grins had the clerk pull out the actual Canon battery pack. They are identical in form, controls and function. The Canon had a slightly different feel to the material at the bottom of the grip, but the difference is negligible. The Canon is certainly not worth double the price. Just buy it you won't regret it"
5,This Battery Grip is Great!!!!,I have had the Opteka battery grip for about three weeks and I think it is the best addition for the Rebel XTI that you can get. It adds a sense of control in the hand that was missing from this small bodied digital slr. I recently went to a butterfly exhibit in Grand Rapids and had a 300mm telephoto/macro lens on the camera and the larger grip gave my hand the extra stability to shoot very close to the butterflys with no hand shake at all.If you buy nothing else for your digital Rebel camera you should get this grip. As an added bonus you get two additional batteries! I priced the batteries at our local Best Buy $45.95 each. The cost of the two batteries covers the cost of both the batteries and the grip.
1,piece of garbage,The grip is comfortable but is horrible when using the camera at an vertical angle. when shooting vertical the battery grip loses connection and the camera loses power. i had to finally resort to taping the the battery shelf in. it just isn't built well and the locking mechanism doesn't hold tight. i also have had issues where the grip would cause my camera to freeze up and i would have to remove the grip to get my camera to reset. pay the extra and get a canon battery grip.
4,Battery Pack Grip,"Overall deliver the results for use at a lower cost then original Canon. But at lower quality, example the ruber material in the holding area separated from the main buddy and I had to glue it back."
5,Great Product,"I ordered this grip and received it the following business day. The grip is well constructed and attached to the camera in seconds. I was weary about using after market batteries, but I just shot a wedding and I was amazed with the results. I took over 700 shots with AF IS lenses and I still have some juice left!My only beef with the grip is that is makes the camera kinda bulky and heavy...but I guess you have to expect that. Do not let this stop you from buying this great product!!"
5,Battery power grip,The grip came in very quick fashion and works as it should. I am very pleased with the experience.
5,Handy battery grip,"This is a very handy device and it works very nicely with my Canon XTi,I really like the ability to use AA batteries in it.I highly recomend it!"
4,Best buy,"The things I didn't like about this product are the following:- The rubber grip portion at the back is peeling, but push the rubber again to where it should stick then it would stick again. Then after a while it would start peeling off again.- The shutter button in the vertical grip feels cheap.- The manual looks so cheap. It needs a lot of spell check.But I guess these are tolerable considering that it saved me a lot of money (darn + 2 NB-2LH batteries!) Everything else is just WOW!I would definitely recommend this to my friends, especially those who are like me, in a tight budget."
5,Opteka Batter pack grip,"I received the battery pack grip in a timely fashion. I've used it for several weeks now and it does exactly what I want. I put 2 batteries into the unit and will shoot all night without having to change batteries. The size of the unit actually gives me better control of the camera so I leave it on all the time. I do not use it as it was intended, to shoot in vertical mode. After 30 years of doing it one way, I found it awkward to use this unit to do it differently. For the price of 2 good replacement batteries, I bought this unit with 2 new batteries and so far could not be happier."
4,Great addition to my Canon Rebel XT,I ordered this to get some extra batteries as well as add to the time I could shoot without changing batteries. It has worked very well for me. I like the extra size it adds to the camera body (even with smaller hands as I am a woman). I am sure that the extra size it adds to the camera makes it easier for men to handle too. Both of the non-Canon brand batteries have worked well for me so far (several months). I would buy this product again.
4,Good value for the money,"This is a good package containing the battery grip and two extra batteries for the Canon Digital Rebel XTi. Although it's not a Canon branded product, with some noticeable difference in product quality (as mentioned in other reviews), it's still good value for the money. Keep in mind this entire package costs slightly less than one extra battery from Canon.The battery grip comes with two inserts, one where you can use from one to two lithium ion batteries at any time - with very good battery life; the other insert takes six AA batteries and can be used for situations where it's not possible to recharge the lithium batteries.If you're into brand, buy the Canon battery grip. If you are looking for functionality and value for the money, the Opteka Battery Pack Grip is a good choice."
2,Maybe I should have bought the Canon Brand...,"It worked great in all aspects until one day the turn latch that holds in the battery fell apart. It was about 10 months of use. I received a warranty replacement, and paid shipping. Then 2 weeks after the one year warranty was up it does not function in the vertical position. When I turn it to take portrait shots the grip somehow prevents the camera from shooting. I removed the grip and the Rebel XTi functioned fine, put the grip back on and it malfunctioned again. Maybe the Canon brand would have been better...maybe not?"
4,"Nice Grip, Nice quality, Low Price, No Regrets","Just received my battery grip today so I've only fired a few shots using it.Negatives: The shutter release is quite a bit more ""soft"" than I had expected, but I dont expect to use it all that often. The rubber grip inlay has some bubbling along the edges and I'm sure its only a matter of time before it starts to peel, though a little super glue will take care of that.I haven't had a chance to charge the 2 additional batteries yet so I cant speak to their ability.Positives: Great price, cant imagine paying $40-50 more basically just to have the Canon label on it. Great fit to the camera, no gaps or misalignments. Dramatic improvement in the overall feel of the camera. I finally have a place to comfortably place my pinky finger.The Positives far outweigh the minor imperfections, cant go wrong with this one."
2,Defective product. Battery cartridge loses contact when camera rotated to the left.,"Upon receiving my Opteka grip today, the quality seemed fine and consistent with the build of my camera, which is the only reason it got two stars. I immediately installed it following the directions and it fit firmly and securely. After I inserted the battery tray cartridge, I started the unit up per the instructions. It seemed to be working flawlessly...until I tilted the camera to the left. There is a very small amount of play in the cartridge once it is closed, and the small amount of movement causes it to lose contact and therefore power. For the unit to properly work, I have to hold my hand up against the side of the cartridge to keep it from losing power. I've contacted the seller to determine if I just have a defective unit."
3,Not sure you need it,"pros: Vertical shots are easier to take, don't have to change batterycons: I think it's overkill for this camera. Quality is OK, the door seems like it could break any time I open it."
5,Great,"Good product, battery NOT included. You need to purchase another battery to make the set for two on use only one.But it's a great product for the $$"
3,Ok if i didn't have to repair it!,"This grip is ok, but it came with a flaw from factory, the battery door has a pin that makes the camera on or off, the pin is to short, so when i was using the camera vertically, (and in other times too), it turns the camera off, and i had to put pressure on the door so it will push the pin and turn the cam on. I had to put a little sort of glue to the door knob so it'll push the pin a little bit further in order to use the cam, which is working fine now, the other thing is the pad that covers the grip, i don't know how much will it last since it appears to be pealing off. Anyways this one is half the price the canon is and it came with two batteries, that are really good. I haven't tested the canon yet so i can't make comparisons."
3,You get what you pay for...,"This battery grip does what it's supposed to and the two additional batteries are nice.Pros: Vertical controls on grip, two high capacity batteries, price.Cons: The grip wiggles a little when attached to my 350D and that's very disconcerting. This grip does not fit as flush with the camera as the Canon grip on my 20D. The buttons are mushy but fine.If you've never shot with a Canon grip you'll probably be fine. If you're used to a Canon grip, buy a Canon grip. You'll notice the difference in quality."
4,Not what I expected... But Good,"I was looking for a battery grip extended battery, but this is just 2 batteries that go into the battery grip. Still has Excellent life in my Rebel XTI and you can actually just have one battery in to use and makes it a little lighter, while still having the convinence of the grip."
3,Needs work,"The music here is okay for ballet at home or in a beginning/intermediate class - but nothing stupendous. Moreover, I have to seriously question the production values of a CD that lists ""excercises"" not once - but twice!! Have they ever heard of proofreading!?!"
4,Relies a lot on Rifkin,But does a good job encapsulating the work done up until that point on the looming disappearance of work. Takes a open minded view on the potential charade of Say's Law and economists claims about Technological Unemployment.
4,Our Relationship with Work - How It Shapes Us and Our Seach for Meaning,"An enlightening analysis of the relationship between us and our jobs. How our jobs are, or should be, more than just about providing a paycheck. Our longing for meaning, for the job that would be an expression of who we are, but that rarely, if ever, finds expression in our lives.The discussion in the book is mostly descriptive than prescriptive, except for the part where the future of work is discussed.Reading this book will give you a new appreciation for work, how it fits into our lives, and how it unavoidably shapes our selves. It will also validate many of the feelings that you might have had about work, including the need to find self-expression and meaning in whatever work we end up doing."
1,Boxing up my return,"I am getting absolutlely zero reception indoors. Even placed on a window, I receive a signal of only 1 (out of 10). After my 20 minutes on hold, I was told that at a minimum you need a signal of 5. Despite being just a few minutes north of a major metro area (SF Bay Area), I am receiving no terrestrial booster signal.Theoretically I could buy the extension cables, punch a (small) hole in the roof and then mount the antenna outside the house, but do I really want to risk life and limb (or contractor's bill) for something that still might not work?Sirius isn't going to rush to tell you that the reception is terrible, but buyer beware, and save your receipt and packing materials. Bummer."
1,No Signal in car...,"This unit works great for a few weeks. I have been through two in the last year. The first unit had the same thing. They work for a few weeks, then it starts taking longer for the signal to be found. I get the message Acquiring Signal for anywhere from 10 to 40 minutes. Customer service first told me this was not a common problem. An obvious lie since this is the second unit it has happened to. Plus there is an earlier positing here that sounds like the same problem. The first time, they agreed pretty quickly to replace the unit. That took about 3 months after originally saying it would be 3 weeks. Now, it has been about a month waiting for a third unit. I am locked in with the annual contract or would definitely get a different model if not go to XM. The other annoying feature is storing songs. It allows 20 songs to be put in memory. This is in contrast to the Starmate which is a more compact unit and lets you put artists into memory as well."
4,Reception is Great!,"I was concerned about using this radio in my home, but found I get excellent reception, without need of aiming the antennae anywhere. BUT, there is a reason for that. I live within 10 miles of downtown Louisville, which is serviced with terrestial repeaters. So, if you live close to an area serviced by repeaters, you likely won't have any reception problems. I have taken the radio out to my parent's house, outside the repeaters area, and still was able to get reception by aiming the antennae through a window....By the way, the direction you aim the antennae depends on where in the country you live. Although where I live, it seems to work pretty much anywhere."
1,Don't plan on it for home use unless you put the antenna outside,"The manual instructions said to point the corded antenna in a certain direction depending on where you live. Fine, still no signal. I called tech support who basically read me the directions as though somehow I couldn't, and then after wasting all that time told me that despite what the instructions say, the antenna for home use ""has to be outside, trust me."" I asked why the manual doesn't say that, and they said to ""call corporate."" The rest of these reviews are probably perfect for any other use except for those of us who live where we can't rout a corded antenna through a door or window so it sits outside all the time. Tech support at Sirius is unprofessional and the product is being falsely advertised as far as I am concerned. If you don't like Howard Stern, vote with your pocketbook and go with XM."
4,Nice Alt-Hist Collection,"As with the other two volumes in the series, this book ranges far and wide through the what-if universe. My particular favorite is Old Hickory's stand in Savannah, written as a series of letters between two brothers. This is a well written collection. However, I did not like ""First, Catch an Elephant"" at all, it doesn't seem to fit the tone of the book, especially when compared to ""Murdering Uncle Ho."""
3,"Better Than the First, Less Than the Second","I like alternate history stories. That's what this is. Each short story asks ""what if"" to change an important point in history. They are generally very entertaining to me.That being said, I did not care all that much for the first volume. The second was a great improvement and I had high hopes for this one. Instead, it fell somewhere between the first two.The stories are generally creative and are technically well written but are not always that interesting. That does not keep the occasional nugget from being present but they are too far between."
1,hip hop tribute...,"(...)The only good rap is Nas, Outkast, and Kanye West. Everything else sucks. I hate how they took the worst possible rappers and told them to try to replicate the gods of rock, AC/DC. That is just so wrong it doesn't even come close to making any sense. If I ever find out just who was responsible for the creation of this abomonation of an album, I'll take legal action. That's how screwed up this is. You can't just immitate AC/DC like this with stupid hip hop and expect anyone who loves AC/DC to like this. And also I'm so sick of all these reviewers (mostly on iTunes) giving this five stars and saying AC/DC sucks (or as they say, 'sux'. That explains their intelligence). Those people are probably homosexuals or just plain dumb people. Anybody who'd give this five stars needs help. SERIOUS help. And besides, if you somehow favor hip hop moreso than the greatest rock band ever, why the hell would you come on here and look up ""AC/DC"" anyway?! God people are so stupid! (...)"
1,An awful reprint of a good book.,"This reprint is of a lower-than-fax quality.Take page 19 for instance: the seven coins of the original edition are reproduced as seven black spots.This is a good book, but you better buy a used copy of the original edition instead of this grimy reprint."
4,Welcome to Mithraism,"Cumont's work is generally considered to be the quintessential work on the Mithraic cult. His book presents a well researched and easily readably description of this religion. Mostly he focuses upon how the religion was spread in the Roman Empire, where it originated and some of its basic dogmas. However, if you are looking for a description of the secret initiation rituals you will have to look elsewhere. While he does mention these rituals in brief, there is no extensive description or analysis on them."
3,"Interesting book, but misdirected focus","This book is about an important but forgotten bombing and mass murder in 1870's Europe by a former Confederate agent and con man from Canada. His life and events leading up to the explosion that killed so many people is well covered, but the actual crime and aftermath is skimmed over rather quickly. After all the build-up, the reader is left longing for the same in-depth exploration of the investigation as was given for the earlier years. Still, it is a fairly enjoyable book."
1,failed after 2 days,though I did not experience the feel issues other reviewers mentioned and thought this was a good enough replacement the control Key came off after only 2 days light use - not a good sign..
2,Not from Dell,"As shown in the Add that it is manufactured by Dell, that is not correct. As per the seller, it is made by OEM which manufactures for Dell (please note:- he agreed not by Dell). But there is no proof on the keyboard delivered even by OEM. I still haven't used it, so can't comment on quality. But certainly I bought considering being a Dell original which was not the case."
4,Does the trick,We spilled a cup of coffee on the computer had to replace the keyboard....this replacement works great. The keys feel a bit different but it I would definitely buy this product again.
5,Good as new!,"The caps lock, shift and tab button on my dell laptop stopped working in 2007. I took my computer to best buy for repair and it was going to cost more than the laptop itself to ""problem,"" which was NOT the keyboard itself. So, I kept it as is and adjusted my typing over the past 4 hours. A month ago I ordered this keyboard just to give it a try. My dad installed it and my laptop is good as new again It was cheap, no shipping & handling fees and I got it the very next day!"
3,Dell Inspiron 6400 repl keyboard,"Metal backplate of keyboard was bent in upper right corner when I received it right where it is held in place by a plastic lip on laptop. I had to tweak it with a pair of pliers repeatedly until it fit properly. So far it's working fine. Either it was shipped that way or was improperly packaged for shipping (a thin almost useless layer of stuff that looks like it wanted to be cardboard, but isn't, surrounded the keyboard)."
1,Wasn't what I expected...worked abnormally!!!!!,"I bought this product as a replacement keyboard for my Inspiron E1505/6400 and was very disappointed that it was incompatible with my system. When the system was booted it made a beep sound that was absent prior to the replacement!! No other adjustments were made to the system. When I reinstalled the original keyboard and rebooted, there was no beep sound. So the system was normal again. I also noticed that the model number on both keyboards were different. However I took it for granted that the keyboard should work since it says its compatible with my system, Inspiron E1505/6400.I recommend for others to properly check the model number of system components before choosing replacements and not just go by the blanket info in product descriptions."
1,Total Junk!,Received this keyboard and found that several keys did not work at all. Some required excessive pressure. One key was just hanging on by the edge and apparently about to fall off completely! The keys had a very strange feel and sound--like crunching cellophane.This thing represents the epitome of Chinese junk! I'm surprised and dissapointed that Amazon would sell anything of such low quality.
5,Great Keyboard,My keyboard stopped working on my Dell Inspiron 1505 and I ordered this keyboard to replace it. Installation was quite simple (There are directions easily found online) and I've had it for 2 months with no problems. It looks and feels the same as the original!
1,Defective keyboard received,Received keyboard looks made of cheap material. It doesn't work on Dell Inspiron 640m. I expected it to be at least functional even though made of cheap material.
3,"Arrived damaged, but functional","The replacement keyboard arrived in working order, but was slightly damaged. The metal tabs along the bottom edge that hold the keyboard in place were bent, and the ""3"" key is squashed in, although works properly. I was able to straighten out the tabs enough to force the keyboard into the laptop, but not enough to keep the keyboard from flexing when installed. This resulted in a bouncy action to the keystrokes. Decided to keep the part since it did work and i didn't want to deal with the hassle of a return."
5,Works for me!,"So we had a little mishap....dog decided to snack on my laptop. A little corner chew....but loved the keyboard. Managed to get a couple completely off. ARGH! Can't fix the little case corner dents, but after getting this, popping off the keyboard and putting in the new one, we're back in action! Fast shipping, simple to do. Looked on YouTube and found the instructions. VOILA'!"
3,Good,"Good, but when I see the keyboard from certain angle, some characters appear to be ""doubled"" some others not, like if certain manipulation to the ink of the characters of each key has been performed"
2,Key popped off 2 days in,This keyboard seemed like it was very close to the quality of the OEM board... until the H key popped off two days into typing on it. This board is fine if you're not using the laptop to make a living and don't type for 6 hours straight every morning. This is not for heavy duty typing.
4,Great songs - bad production,"This is a great overview of soul music through the 1960's, capped off by Brook Benton's lush single Rainy Night In Georgia, making this disc worth the price of admission based on that one track alone. The disc is not shy about bringing in an unbalanced amount of Aretha Franklin (but what's not to like?). The songs are fantastic and memorable, but the disc suffers from low end transfer, and begs for a re-master."
4,enjoying the past again,wonderful memories and wonderful artists are being once again in my friends home. i purchased this as a gift and he loved it!
2,Not a smooth reading and only about american/british cities,"This book is just a bunch of papers about planning history gathered together. Even worse, it talks only about american and english cities, what is only a fraction of it could be."
5,Great Toy,I have a Pit Bull that tears up all his toys. This toy is actually pretty big and decently durable. I would buy again!
5,Amazing rhythym & blues,"Yes, he wrote Louie Louie. Forget that.If you like jumpin' rhythym & blues,like Johnny guitar Watson and Gatemouth Brown you will love this album!"
4,An eye-opening revelation of what lies behind nightly news.,"Solomon and Cohen reveal to the reader the ""wizards"" who pull the levers behind the headlines, the corporations who desire to slant the situations in their favor, by their use of money and influence. More of a liberal lean, in an era when parents need to hear from their children that ""liberal"" is not a dirty word. Unafraid to name names, to point out those who benefit from corporate/political shenanigans, and smoke and mirror games. Journalists take a hit as well, and rightly so, for their part in pulling the wool over the eyes of the public. Worthwhile reading for anyone who believes that Dan, Peter, and Tom are not telling the whole story. Worthwhile for discussion groups!"
2,I really was confused,"I couldn't quite get the point of the book. I mean, I know that killing baby seals is bad, and also those big corporations and all, but what about Professors Harris and Chomsky and the deconstruction of the question about the operations of patriarchy and about how we have to end womyn's suffrage??? This book is on the right route but on the wrong highway, if you know what I mean."
5,ESOL PRAXIS STUDY GUIDE,"Great study guide for those who intend on taking this test. Very good feedback on the back pages directing you to the areas of weakness, so you know exactly what you need to review more of!"
5,Fit perfectly and was easier to buy online,"I had stopped at several local auto parts stores and none had my size. So ordering on Amazon turned out to be the easiest, and probably least expensive, option."
1,Wrong filter for Mazda CX-7!!!!,"Amazon part specifier lists this as fitting the CX-7, but according to Fram site, it only fits the Mazda 3 and 5."
5,It fits perfectly,What can I say other than it fits perfectly? It's nice to have parts delivered instead of waiting in line at the parts store while the cashier talks on the phone to people that can't be bothered to come into the store!
1,"Sure filter is fine, Amazon's part service is bad",Amazon showed this filter would fit my 2011 Mazda2. It is not the correct model however. I think this is the filter for a Mazda3.
5,Unbelievably rich,"This book tells an often retold tale in such a dramatic way that you feel you are living it and remembering the murder, the southern town racism, along with the author. I read it and read it again. Then bought it for my collection. Then went and read another title by the author...which didn't live up to this one, but how could it?"
4,Well done,"Lewis Nordan always manages to write great novels, and WOLF WHISTLE is no exception. This book is a little more serious than his other novels, but, somehow, it still manages to be very funny. At times, you want to laugh out loud. At other times, you want to cry. It is an emotional roller coaster: one of the best books to come out of the south."
4,not what you first expect,"This book started out throwing me completely off track, and seemed to be about NOTHING that was stated on the cover. The meanings are far deeper than the action, especially the symbolism which creeps under your skin when you're least expecting it. I was surprised a lot by this book. I wrote lots of notes in the margins and read more than one story at the same time. Very deep."
2,Visol curve 6 oz liquor flask,"over priced, stainless steel is thin, finger print all over when you use it, under 10$ is ok, not 25$"
1,WCW Slamboree 1995 review,"The World tag team title match between Harlem Heat & The Nasty Boys was not great but pretty good. The match between Kevin Sullivan & The Man with no name was awful. The Legends match between Wahoo McDaniel & Dick Murdoch was a dud. The IWGP title match between The Great Muta & Paul Orndroff was 15 minutes of garbage. The TV title match between Arn Anderson & Alex Wright was not great but still watchable. The Meng-Hawk match was a no-sell brawl. The Sting-Big Bubba Rogers match was bad. The tag team match between Hulk Hogan & Randy Savage against Rick Flair & Vader was pretty fun. Overall,despite the two good matches it still stinks. I give this ppv a 1 out of 10."
5,Awesome Book!,"This book opens up a detailed, behind the scenes look into the world of Star Wars. Littered throughout the book are TONS of pictures, diagrams, foldouts, tables, etc. that explain all of the minute details behind pretty much everything in the original Star Wars Trilogy. Also featured are blueprints and floor plans as well as concept art depicting houses, and structures from the movies. There are three portions to the book. The first is the Technical Guide to Tatooine, followed by the Technical Guide to the Galactic Empire, and finished with the Technical Guide to the Rebel Alliance. This book is elegantly bound and reprints the three hard to find special issues of Starlog in which these guides were originally printed. I would recommend this book to any Star Wars fan."
4,"Tehnical Journal, not for all craft.","This is a great book, even though it is a copy of the Starlog 3 issue SW technical journals, it is worth the money. I have a problem with this book. It doesn't contain any pictures of Vader's Tie fighter, lightsabers, Vader's helmet.... But what the hell....it contains a lot of other spacecraft and vehicle photos."
2,A little cheesy.,"This book did provide pictures of many of the ships in the movie, but most of them were closeups of models instead of cut-scenes from the movie. The difference is like watching your kid play w/ action figures instead of watching a really cool movie. The text kept refering to ""the Skywalker Tour,"" what's up with that?"
5,Total Eighties----Fantastic!,"This CD is so fantastic--I love Debbie Gibson. It not only illustrates the eighties style of music but also illustrates Debbie's true potential. I love it! A wide variety of songs is offered, ranging from ""Silence Speaks"" and ""Lost In Your Eyes"" to ""Who Loves Ya Baby?"" and ""Should've Been the One."" Encore! Rock on, Debbie!"
4,pretty pink pop songs,"i recently fell over this tape and listened to it. i was shocked to find it's not all that bad! it's one good pop song after another. Meaningless, but happy. somehow this reminded me of Britney Spears...."
3,Debbie's Electric Youth Just Blew A Fuse!,"I liked this album back in the days--mainly because Debbie Gibson was my teen idol. But looking back now, most of her music was absolutely bubble gum! This was back in her squeaky clean, neat, good girl days. I did like a couple of her songs such as ""Electric Youth"" and ""No More Rhyme"". Sorry Ms. Gibson, but these songs would be good on the GREASE 3 soundtrack."
3,Miss Gibson,"One of the original teen stars that paved the way for Tiffany, Rihanna, Aguilera, and many more. ""Lost in Your Eyes"" is to this day one of my favorite pop love songs ever. Good dance music is another attraction. Outdated, yes. A blast from the past? Even more so!"
2,kindergarten fun,"I recently found this tape while cleaning out my attic and gave it a listen after nearly choking on dust and rolling on the carpet laughing at her cheesy 80s ensemble. This was the first pop artist I was ever into and at the age of six I felt oh-so-cool blasting this while my friends I and played dress-up. Now that my music preferences have changed dramatically over the last 10 years, (riot grrl,punk, random indie stuff) I really dislike this type of teeny bop crap, but debbie will always be exempt from that kind of bashing. I could never have made it to first grade without her!"
1,Incredible bleeech,"Squeaky, infantile, badly-produced, empty-headed, unimaginative, dull, shallow, dumb, pointless, lacking energy, talent-free, poorly performed and unencumbered by originality. I could continue, but I think you get the idea."
3,High Voltage Youth,"OUT OF THE BLUE,Debbie Gibson's debut album was still on the pop charts in fall 1988 when she was working on this album. The title track is a great dance tune. LOST IN YOUR EYES makes me frown if not cry. The love ballad debuted on the radio in January 1989,as did this album. It became one of the year's top hits. Back then,I was a senior in high school and I was looking forward to the prom four months later. I never went because I couldn't get anybody to go with me. Now,the regret will forever haunt me. I'm sure the song was played at proms at the time since the song was on the pop charts. I wouldn't want to hear LOST IN YOUR EYES without slow-dancing to it with my girl. The other songs are excellent."
1,Deceptive Listing,"Product is NOT the official Remington SP-282 advertised by Shaver Outlet, although it may be similar. It is a no-name knock-off arriving in seperate parts at virtually the Remington price. Buyer beware...... I'll go elsewhere, next time."
3,Post Existentialist.,Could not enjoy the movie because my personal experience is much different. It seems much of the stuff on the market in the way of creative thinking ends being some kind of Hindu or One with the world or universe or whatever... I guess after people try to beat each other out of life they begin to seek something out of the ordinary but the issues they have are close to the same. There were some points of focus in the movie that might just make you think....
5,barbie collector,nice product for a collector. the box will never be opened and i must admit the price on amazon was the best i found. my only complaint and it is really not amazons fault is that i like the box to be in mint condition and sometimes in shipping there are small nicks that appear on the sides. love it though
4,"Beautiful Doll, A Must for Lucy Lovers!","The reason I gave this fun doll four stars was because the box she arrived in was dented up. I'm not really a collector and will probably keep her out of the box on my desk but it really is a nice and enjoyable doll. However, I would wait until it is on sell, I bought the doll before christmas for about $[...] which is worth that price."
1,"Returned Item twice, did not get refund!","Hi,I received this item twice, both times they were packaged improperly, causing the boxes to have dents. They were bought for my daughter who ""collects"" them. I specified extra packing on the second item, to no avail. Since I now have to file a dispute through my Credit Card company, to get my refund, I will no longer shop with Amazon."
1,This book is NOT for 4-8 year olds,"My only comment about this book is that if your child believes in Santa Claus or the Tooth Fairy -- do not let your child read this book. I was horrified as my son was reading along to find a paragraph about the fact that there is no Santa and there is no Tooth Fairy. If they upped the aged level, or took out that paragraph, the book would be excellent."
1,Not family friendly,"This book is not family friendly. Be aware of your audience before purchasing this book, it is not appropriate for children."
2,TIME OUT,"What I ordered isn't what came in the box. That's not the big issue here though. I ordered a self setting clock because my hobby is time. The exact time. I've had this clock for about 2 weeks and I THINK the time is correct. It's hard to tell because the workmanship of the instrument is very poor. The second hand doesn't line up with the printed display of seconds and minutes as it ticks the time away. Not only that, the hands are loose which allows gravity to ""adjust"" the time (+/- 1/2 minute) depending on which side of the '12' the minute hand is on. I called the factory and was told that this problem can't be fixed and is 'common' with all their time pieces. Well duh, I could have spent 1/10 the price and gotten the same quality at Do Dah Mart. The clock in itself is pretty and would be a keeper if only I had the time to figure out the time."
5,time saver,"I have one of these irons and love it. I use it all the time for my sewing business. It saves me time, when I am pressing material. My kids love it for pressing t-shirts and jeans."
3,Singer CSP! Magic Steam Press,"The unit arrived on time and works as described.I bought it to press 100% cotton shirts for work. Despite several months of practice and following the instructions it still took me several hours to get seven shirts wrinkle free with smooth stand up collars, and nice creases in the sleeves. The unit is not big enough to do an entire shirt in one press, but takes at least seven repositionings to get one whole shirt done.The accessories provided were adequate. I would suggest adding a flat stick like an unused wooden paint stirrer to hold things in place as you close the press, withdrawing it at the last moment. Make sure you have a sturdy worksurface on which to work."
4,"Very pretty, nice quality",The earrings arrived well packaged and as pretty as the pictures. They seem to be constructed well and I am very happy with the purchase.
4,All I need is ...,"... ""turned away."" I don't even care what else is on the CD, that is one song that will stand for all time as a true R&B classic."
4,"Side one is definately the ""ONE""","This artist's album will always be with my music collection. No loaning this one out! Side one is mainly the side that I play when I'm in the mood for Chuckii. Very smooth R&B that takes me back to my high school years. The song ""Heavenly Father"" is my favorite song because of it's spiritual pleading."
3,"Great Photos, Lousy Binding","The book features stunning examples of classic photos of some of my favorite jazz artists by Francis Wolff including some I hadn't seen elsewhere. However, the cover seemed cheap/flimsy. In fact the cover separated from the pages in transit. Even at this price, I'd shy away from this one in favor of the more expensive hard cover unless you're planning on cutting out the photos any way."
5,Tight in the groove.,"This suspension has been one of the best additions to my Dodge Ram project. The front drop was not difficult, but when it came to the rear time and two people is what I needed. The performance on the road is a big improovement from stock, or in my case, twelve inches above stock. Delivery was quick and to the door."
4,Solidly Informative,"Fabled Service is solid proof of the importance of customer service supported by Sanders's experience with Nordstrom. Businesses strive for customer service, and Sanders provides useful and detailed explanations and strategies for how to attain the basic concept of excellent customer service. Fabled Service is as good as Michael Levine's Guerilla PR: Wired, which explains how to attain excellent public relations coverage in the modern age without busting the budget."
2,i'm still hungry,"first let me say that THIS IS NOT THE MOVIE WITH DAVID BOWIE.but i knew that when i bought it. Showtime has/had a horror series, much like Twilight Zone or Tales from the Crypt, called the Hunger. they got Bowie to host a few episodes. this is a collection of four ""vampire"" episodes from the show.i use the term ""vampire"" loosely. most of them are not your typical vampires. you see NO fangs, almost no blood, and only one scene in which a vampire takes blood. you DO see a lot of sex."
2,Hm....,"Not really a ""movie"", but a series of a couple of different short-film episodes with different themes and tales of vampires. It was ok...I wouldn't rent it again though."
5,Solid Collection of Soul Music,"I LOVE every single track on this CD!! My favorite soul music is definitely from the 70s. I like 60s soul but there is something about 70s soul that intrigues me more. My favorite track is definitely ""Until You Come Back To Me"" by Aretha Franklin. Other standout tracks are ""Could It Be I'm Falling In Love"" by the Spinners, ""Feel Like Makin' Love"" by Roberta Flack, and ""Don't Let the Green Grass Fool You"" by Wilson Pickett. Anyone who enjoys soul music, you have to definitely purchase this CD.....believe me, you won't regret it."
3,"What are the songs, Amazon???",Why even list this when there are no track listings? This is becoming commonplace at Amazon.
3,Does not reflect black music well.,This is a great CD except for the fact that the artists are from just one label. So this is a very narrow spectrum of black music. Look for one that has a mix of artists from different labels.
2,Haunting of Fox Holow Farm,This movie was more of a documentary of the horrors that happened at Fox Hollow Farm! I thought it was going to be more about the paranormal investigations themselves and it was more about the serial killer himself. I could have watched that on Investigation Discovery and saved my money!!
3,OK for the price,I bought this lens for its price. It takes ages to focus. The build quality is pretty bad. Pictures come out pretty sharp. Not for low light situations.
3,Decent Lens for the Price,"Pros:CompactLight-weightGood feel/build, looks great too!Wide coverage of focal lenghtsCons:Poor image qualityLoss of contrastI bought this lens about six months ago for my Nikon D60, despite the fact that it would not auto-focus with my camera. Even when properly focused, I would notice a loss of saturation and contrast at longer focal lengths, and often the effects were beyond the help of photoshop. It was a shame; the lens really felt good in my hands; it was a decent size, good build to it, and the included hood was nice; just lacking in image quality."
3,not autofocus,I did not realize that this would not autofocus on a nikon d3000. I bought it for my son for Christmas.. If I had known that I would have bought something else. They should point that out in the description.
2,Disappointed,"This sterling silver cross is much smaller than I expected. Its image onAmazon suggested something larger, although I might've known from the price that it would be small. The packaging was fine, and arrival time was speedy."
2,Poster was not the one Shown,"The classic version of the poster shown in the picture for this product was not what was delivered - the one that was sent looks like a cheap knockoff of the real poster (small white text saying ""Led-Zeppelin"" where the large red letters should be, no symbols at the bottom, only a small portion of the figure visible on the right hand side, etc.) However, it came packaged nicely, so it would've been great if it were what was advertised."
3,"Instrumental music, not vocal.","Be aware that this music is written for treble instruments (violin, to be specific) not for voice. No words are provided, even for the folk songs or for other pieces that were originally intended to be sung.The readability, the typesetting, and the paper quality of this book are good."
3,Not for novices,"I had hoped this book would have practical advise for beginners, and lots of pictures, and how-tos, such as how to prune, when and where, but I was disappointed, too much information and history that I did not need to know. Not much help for those with plants in containers, and those in the Northeast."
3,little disapointed with product,the frist problem was the bumper was not silver like adverticed it was power coated gray. the second problem was only two of the four holes would line up.had to drill the other two.
4,ring,"I LOVE THE RING IT WAS FOR MY SONS 21 BIRTHDAY. IT IS DIFFERENT AS I GIVE ALL MY SONS A RING FOR THEIR 21ST BIRTHDAY. AND I LIKE I CAN MAKE THEM DIFFERENT,ONE MORE TO GO."
4,Claddagh ring,"This product is very very beautiful, but it only comes in one size and i am going to have to get it re-seized for my boyfriend which is going to coast an additional $30-$40. Also the diamonds in the display picture look much bigger than they actually do, in person they appear so small that i thought it was just more white gold.for this price i would recommend this ring, but i am very glad that i didnt pay $400"
2,Corrosion,The electrical connections on power cord are small and quickly consumed by corrosion. There just isn't enough metal to withstand the constant required cleaning.
4,Very good concert,"I didn't know this dvd even existed, but I'm glad I found it. No, there's no Rickey Medlock, but there's still 2 original members, and the other guys are very quality players and stick true to Blackfoot music. If U like Blackfoot at all U'll like this one."
5,Aquis towels are great!,"The description on the middle of the page indicates that it includes a headband and slippers. It does not. It does have the lavender eye pillow, mitts, towel, washcloth and robe. I have other aquis towels, and the one in this package is the same size as my large adventure towel, and the same fabric. I thought the robe would be a similar type of fabric, with a different weave. The robe is actually a thicker fabric, with the waffle weave, so it takes longer to dry than the hair towels. I find the hair towel just perfect for daily use and for the gym. I bought this on a friday sale with a $20 off coupon, so it was definitely a great value, and I would buy it again. I don't know if i'll use the mitts. I also love the white color because it does not run, like my other aquis towels."
4,Good,"I always have liked Field Mob from their debut to this album. The single ""So What"" got me hooked right away to this album and this is not only the good song there are plenty of them on here. Anyways just buy this album if you are a fan of Field Mob and non fans may not like this but in my opinion it is a good album. F@CK THA HATERS"
4,field mob,i thought the cd was pretty good it was the best...but there was some hot tracks on there and a couple trunk bangaz but utha then that it was a decent cd..i would sugest u go cop it

3,its the new mob,mane these boys r to st8 on the real theres no one out there that sound like dem and that on the real but i cant say this album is better then the first one but it st8 tho.....
1,Light Poles and Pine Trees is not that good.,"Light Poles & Pine Trees * 1/2 StarsField Mob has made some good albums in the past, but this one is a mess, the lyrical content is completely confused, the writing is awful, the beats are so silly and the everything else is just so ridiculous and predicable, it's useless.and it's over the top.If you like field mob, go pick up their first 2 albums instead.Thumbs Way Down for Me."
3,3 and a Half stars,"I thought this album was ok. The tracks on it that are good are REALLY good and the rest are either mediocre or completely wack. Overall, the album is above average and definatly worth checking out.Top Tracks:1,2,3So WhatGeorgiaAt The ParkPistol GripBlacker The Berry"
4,Not Surprised,"I don't know what to think about this book. Sure, Elizabeth is a little different than usual, but they've done that how many times??? I'm not surprised by Jessica either. But I wish that Sam and Elizabeth would NOT get together! Personally, I think that she and Todd were the cutest couple ever, and even though Todd's dating Dana, he still obviously likes Elizabeth at least a little. And if you read other books in the the series and High series, you'd see what I mean. Sam and Liz were SO not meant to be, and Todd and Liz had something once. But this is a book review, not my opinion on the happenings! So I liked the book, but I might have changed just a few things."
2,Very boring,"This book was the cure to my insomnia. I can honestly say that I really don't care if Elizabeth and that punk Sam hooks up or not. I just hope that by the next book they have Tom Watts acting like the dignified reporter that I know he still is. As for Todd, he has been over Elizabeth for a very long time, so his arguing with Tom doesn't make much sense to me. Interesting enough, they are arguing over Elizabeth, the girl neither has been with. But not over Dana, the girl they have both slept with. I guess Laurie John wants us to believe that no guy can get over Elizabeth, and truly fall in love with another girl. I see Todd and Dana's breakup already, because she has done a complete 180 and become clingy too fast. And that's too bad, because I actually like Dana. I'm sick of Elizabeth. And Jessica, the immature, whiny, spoiled brat!! She needs a good punch in the face. And I was hoping Pam gave it to her. I'm with Neil. Quit kissing Jessica's ***."
1,annoyed,im so sick of this Elizabeth+ todd thing. its been going on since svt and they keep breaking up and getting back together and then after they break up they still have feelings 4 each other. its getting old fast
2,Bad,"I don't really like this boook at all; boring, uninteresting and Liz seems different......................it's kinda weird"
2,realy boring,this book was really boring it was all about sam and liz and todd and tom feeling jealous .Jessica is not normal and ditzy and runs away and is NOT stranded .i would say this book is the worst in the svu series mayb if u read the trilogy it would b better but i would not waste my money.If this is the first svu book you have read they r not all that rubish
1,not very original or exciting,"This book was so labored, I could hardly finish it. The Elvis scenario was preposterous! I am so tired of all the senseless bickering; these characters are beginning to sound like spoiled, vacuous brats. It makes me laugh when Elizabeth questions ""since when"" has she allowed men to control her emotions, and picked one so completely unlike herself. When hasn't she done that? William White, Mike McAllery, Ryan the lifeguard, etc. She gravitates toward jerks, not unlike her sister does. We read the books, we remember the trends. Also, I think Tom is abusive to Elizabeth. I really hope these plot lines improve. There are so many interesting angles and ideas to be written about without beating old themes to death."
3,A Must-have for any serious Wagner collector,"These tapes contain readings of a number of stories from Wagner's ""Night Winds"" collection (this site contains numerous five-star reviews of that book), including Two Suns Setting and Lynortis Reprise. Unfortunately, its a fairly low-budget affair, and the voice acting leaves something to be desired. I recommend it more as a novelty than as a serious way to get into the stories. Still, if you like books on tape and can't find a print of the written version . . ."
5,Had it for a While,"Best investment on my computer - I spend a lot of time reading on the computer, and this has made my eyes relax.My parents have the VX900 19"" LCD, but I highly prfer this one. More widescreen so movies look better. I have the DVI connection going, and while playing UT 2003 I had ZERO ghosting problems.Great monitor, great company, nothing more to be said!"
1,Failed after a few weeks use,"Total waste of money. This iron barely worked for a few weeks, spitting water here and there. After the third week or so, the iron simply stopped working. Yes, there is a 1 year warranty, but it is not worth the hassle and $5.50 shipping expense, plus the length of time it takes to get a replacement iron."
1,What a waste,"The iron spits water everywhere, even when it's on the higher settings. It just leaks, leaks, and keeps on leaking. So my workaround is to use the iron as a dry iron. It doesn't take the wrinkles out of anything. So I use a spray bottle to spray water on my clothes. I have to press really hard to try to get the wrinkles out. It's not worth it, and I got this iron as a free Christmas gift from my company. Don't waste your time or money buying this iron. You will regret it."
5,Been using it for three years- No problems yet,This is an excellent product. I've used it for three years with no problems whatsoever.
1,Kitty hates this stew,"Tried gradually introducing this in with his favorite foods including yogurt in a 1:3 mix. Kitty never really liked it. I then tried full strength-still no effect. I am now left with 11 unused cans. Plus, these are really large cans and I don't see my portly 11-pound kitty eating even quarter of this can at any one time (even he took a liking to it). Which means you will have to store this in a refrigerator until the second use. The first can I opened gathered mold when I left the half empty can in the closet."
3,Yawn.,"Unfortunately, Bickham has trouble keeping me interested. He does a good job of explaining scene and sequel, but you can get the same and better from Dwight Swain (who taught Bickham) and Manuel Komroff; HOW TO WRITE A NOVEL. James N.Frey recommends Bickham, but I think Frey does a better job of teaching how-to-write than Bickham does. My biggest problem with Bickham is his 'my-way or the hi-way' regimentation. There are much better writers out there who advocate practices Bickham dislikes. And Bickham doesnt even pay lip-service to mastering the fundamentals of good writing, except to note this is something his reader should have already accomplished. This is a book to borrow from the library...not keep."
4,Layout and Design for Calligraphers,"As a teacher of calligraphy, I have used Alan Furber's book many times. He does a great, yet simple job of explaining basic graphic design and layout techniques, but from a calligraphic perspective. The book is filled with actual examples of everything he discusses. From thumbnails to full layouts, Alan gives the reader a ""good"" way and a ""better"" way to arrive at a finished piece. He covers many of the types of work that a calligrapher would be asked to letter. Because of its simplicity and imagery, I would highly recommend this book for beginning to semi-advanced calligraphers who are needing help with basic layout and design techniques."
2,Skip this one...,"I am a new student of calligraphy, and placement is an important aspect of design. This book is certainly a 'quick read', with only 60 pages, and half of those pages are only some examples of what the author thinks looks ""good"" or ""better"". Not how to layout a design, or how to measure to center your work."
1,VERY BAD!,I would have to agree with the person who called it not even up to ringtone quality. I was shocked to hear how cheap this instrumental recreation is. Decent sax play is combined with what sounds like a cheap Casio keyboard! Sounds like bad karaoke music too. A total diservice to the Isley Brothers.
1,I have heard ring tones that sound better,"The music selection is GREAT, but that's as far as it goes.The musicians on this CD, does not do the Isley Brothers justice, the CD sounds like ring tone music, I am very disappointed, I am hoping that somebody else will do a tribute to the Isley Brothers and do it right!"
5,Great data,"This book is extremely helpful, with knowledge about every possible situation that you would find yourself in, and how to properly fuel your body."
4,good starter,Good basic starter. Just be sure it comes with a dvd. First one I ordered came without from a used store...buy new.
3,Kind of Dull,"Pros: Great for stats, A decent amount of good pictures. Coverage of older rally cars, drivers, etc... that you would be hard pressed to find anywhere. That alone is probably the value of the book. The focus on drivers is a great idea.Cons: So general, it will never please you are looking into a particular rally subject. Too much talk and pictures of fans.Overall: Unless you are a die hard rally fan, this book probably wouldn't appeal to you much"
2,NOT ORIGINAL MATERIAL,"""The Drifers - The Greatest Hits"" (ASIN:B0013SGTQ2) is manifestly NOT original material. I can hear synthesizers in the mix.I read some of the other reviews which claimed this collection was original material and then purchased without verification. Mistake. If you read these reviews, you are going to get a mixed message about whether or not this collection is original material. Please listen to samples before you purchase and make up your own mind."
1,Original? I don't think so.,"Acting on the jist of reviews for this recording, I downloaded ""Under the Boardwalk"" for a family function. This is NOT the original track. Very disappointing. I don't know who the guys are on the recording, and altthough I'll bet they put on a nice lounge act someplace, the contemporary instruments, the contemporary recordings, and the totally different voices are very disappointing. I haven't bothered to sample the others- once bitten, as it were. Save your money."
3,"Its OK but,","The Drifters are alway good. This album is good. I purchased it.But,those that are looking for the very late fifties and early sixties singing, will take exception with some of the songs of old provided.Why?The Drifters had featured singers and background vocals changing even with the same song (there were at least 12 different performers). The melodies and harmonics can be very easy or hard to distinguish -they sound a little different- with these changes.Solution,Take advantage of the ""MP3 Downloads"" here and select your individual choice or recollation of the songs. Also do a ""bing"" on ""drifters original recordings"" for assistance."
1,"Dreadful ""new"" versions","I cannot believe the other reviewers are talking about the same album. This lamentable rip-off is chock full of terribly done re-recordings. I was a disc jockey in the late-60s and early-70s and I know what the originals sound like ... and this ain't them.If you're looking for the real thing, you have to go to the source: Atlantic Records (Only In America: Atlantic Soul Classics).This marvelous collection includes the ORIGINAL recordings of great Drifters songs, as well as many other Atlantic performers such as Ben E. King, Don Covay, Sam & Dave and Otis Redding.It is not cheap, but the real thing seldom is."
3,A little dissapointed,These are really cute lights but after I hung them up the margarita glasses kept falling off and breaking because they didn't hook into the lights tight enough. So I was pretty dissapointed. But overall they are what I expected minus them falling off the lights.
4,The Human Element of the Bible,"In Peculiar Treasures, vastly underappreciated theologian and novelist Frederick Buechner blows the dust off of well-known, as well as some quite obscure, people from the Bible. In doing this, Buechner breathes life into these voices from the past, such as I have never seen or read before. He has the enviable knack for seeing far beneath the surface of the Bible, and taking the reader with him to show you what he has found there. As with most of Buechner's works, Peculiar Treasures is best taken in bite-size morsels, with a great deal of meditation in-between on what he has brought to the table. It may not turn out to be Buechner's best work, but I personally found it to be a wonderful place to start."
4,The straight facts,"I have had a bikepro for 3 years, its great. I have read some of the reviews about how hard it is to get the bike out. I am 5' 6"" and weigh 155lbs. I have a Yamaha V-Star 1100cc and after a while got the technique to get it out without too much effort. The benefits outweigh the small amount of time it takes to gain the technique.I can load it and unload it on my own and dont need tight strapping on the forks which does them no good.Solid construction unlike some of the copies, I dont expect to have to replace it at any time"
5,Wheel Chock Adjustment,"I have had one of these wheel chocks for 3 years. I have 3 Harleys, two are heavies. One is a FatBoy, another is a VRod Muscle, both of these are big heavy bikes, and I'm no muscle man. I don't have trouble getting either of these in or out the wheel chock, by myself. Why? Because I read the directions and set up the adjusts first."
5,Bike Pro Motorcycle wheel chock,Product was as advertised and easy to assemble and mount to my trailer. Works perfectly. Very high quality. Thank You.
5,The best Linux Distribution Out there Now,"In the world of Linux, one can get very confused by all of the distributions that exist out there. In the world of commercial linux distributions. SuSE linux stannds out as the most comprehensive distribution with the most software and for a reasonable price. SuSE linux were the very first commercial distribution to ship with a ""personal firewall"" something that's now being implemented in other linux distros and even windows XP. SuSE linux is very user friendly but without compromising the power of linux. The KDE 2.2 interface is awesome and Yast2 makes administration a breeze (something like this is now being implemented in XP's control center, i believe). The choice of Graphical User interfaces is enormous and the choice of journaling filesystems is a plus also. I give them the highest mark possible for quality (as opposed to many other linux distributions that I've tried). SuSE linux is definitely a quality product."
1,It almost 10 years old and practically useless...,"It is terribly outdated, like a museum piece. It has none of today's Linux software and refinements. It would not run on any of today's hardware as it has absolutely no drivers for it. I can't understand why it is still offered as it only confuses and discourages first time Linux users."
4,This was a very good book!!,"Dallas was a 16 year old on her way to a criminal life. She loved the rush she got from ""skating"" with Ray, Pam, and Sonny. ""Skating"" was their word for stealing cars, scaring old lady's to take their purse, holding up a Jiffy-Spot etc. Dallas held up a Jiffy-Spot at gun point and gets caught... This was a very good book; it always had my attention. The writer described the characters well, it felt like I knew them.Then ending of this book SUCKED!!! It made me wonder what happened to Dallas after she left GRC? Did she go back to her old ways on the outs? Did she get better and do what her father had hoped for her whole life? It made me mad!! Other than the ending this was a great book. I recommend it for teenagers anywhere from 14-18 years old."
3,A great book,"I think the book was great. The reason why I did not gave the book a 4 or 5 star was because sometimes it was boring. But sometimes I was sitting there and was corius of what was going to happend. And I like that kind of stories. I also liked the ""type"" the story is about. I like to read books who maybe the story has been true some time. Or story like this who happening in these days in different countries in the world. But i will reccomend this book for people around 12-16. I'm 17, and like I said, sometimes it was boring to read it. But, it was a great book."
2,bad wus bad,"i didnt like this book. it started out normaly, but the interest level just kept on a steady line. there was no climax, and the resolution seemed half baked and last minute."
5,Great actors in a powerful film,"This is a great piece of work from two Oscar winning actors, Robin Williams and Robert DeNiro."
5,EXTRAORDINARY!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Extraordinary,great,interesting movie about people.Robin Williams is wonderfull and sweet,and De Niro is simply perfect as a patient who is awake after 35 years.Every human have to see it!"
4,Great acting. Completely void of spirtuality.,"The acting in this movie was fantastic on all counts. The ultimate message of the movie... hopeless unfortunately. Despite the best of intentions, man's efforts fail - except the doctor gets a girlfriend. Folks, don't let the ending fool you. There is room for the reality of the miraculous. Treating people everyday, I can't imagine myself relating to them without acknowledging them as spiritual beings and not merely patients. The movie - the story - was empty of any reference to God or spirituality - just pure (human founded) science. Another instance of Hollywood leaving God out of the picture. Yet, with God all things are possible, and that is the basis of hope and healing. So, 4 stars for a well acted movie; minus 1 for a movie that would leave people with an non theistic message lacking in hope."
3,Penny Marshall's finest film.,"Awakenings is a depressing film but an important one to watch. Directed by Penny Marshall, Awakenings is based on a true story of patients who have come out of mental illness unscathed, well temporarily of course. Robert De Niro gives the performance of a lifetime and Robin Williams proves he is more than a funny, goofy actor. Penelope Ann Miller is stunning in this film as well, very under-rated actress. Give this '90s tearjerker a viewing, enjoy!"
4,Very Good,I am very happy and pleases with this product. It is just what I expected. Clear vision and very good image.
3,watch out,"The movie is great! However, I ordered a FULL SCREEN format, as advertised, and received a wide-screen version. Worse, upon return with specific notes and re-order, I again received the wide-screen format. The return process through Amazon was quick and easy, but who wants to keep going 'round & round? I give up!"
1,Boring,watched a good bit of it with interest but it got boring and I didn't particularly enjoy watching a mental hospital. Acting was good but the setting was unappealing and the whole thing was too slow.
3,too many holes,Mute and catatonic for 30 years a man who went into inner silence suddently with the use of a new drug regains use of his mental faculties and rebels.Speaking with the intellengence of someone who never was ill and who had substantial education for a man who never was schooled beyond age 10 because of his illness leonard outdo's expectations.But all is not as it seems...A good honest film but u'll feel cheated at the end of this 2 hr film
5,GREAT MOVIE A MUST BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I have not seen this movie in years but when i did see it i think i saw it on hbo. This is such a great movie it is great for the whole family to enjoy and also it is based on a real life story. This is a MUST BUY!!!!!!!! GREAT MOVIE EASY FIVE STAR!!!!!!!!
5,Full color up to date kitchen ideas!!!,This is the book we were searching for! It's loaded with pictures of up to date kitchen ideas. We are planning on redoing our kitchen and this book will be very helpful! I think it is well worth the price!
3,great support,"good support for running. i ordered the green and white colors, Amazon sent me the blue. great deal of 24.00 dollars"
3,Not A Remington Part,"This part will fit into the corresponding Remington model's head, but it won't stay there. It's made to look like the Remington part, but it isn't, as confirmed by Remington customer support. Since Remington does not have parts for these razors anymore, you make-do with what you can find from any source."
5,"works great for THIN hair, NOT for totally bald spots","I've been using Toppik (black) for over a year and it works great,but is very expensive. I've used Couvre (black) for a few months andit works well in combination with Toppik. On its own, it leaves thethin areas still a bit noticeable for my taste. A small application ofToppik hair fibers pretty much fills the tiny gaps that were either missedby applying Couvre, or have not been evenly coated.I showed my kid the ""before & after"" of my thinning (crown) hair andhe could not believe how well this works. And it does not really takethat much time. I apply Couvre for about 2 minutes then let it dryfor about 5-10 mins while I do other stuff. Once dry, I comb my hair andapply a little bit of Toppik. Comb again, then apply a cheap hair sprayto keep the hair style in place for the whole day.Bottomline, if Toppik hair fibers works well for you. Couvre is a wayto significantly reduce the amount of Toppik you need to apply."
1,TOO MESSY!,"This product's price is too expensive for it's worth, it's too messy to use. Believe me, DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY on this one. If you want an alternative for this lousy product, you might as well use a non-fueled household BB-Q charcoal:)"
4,Good product,"Arrived in good condition. Bought the auburn and medium brown colorS to combine. It looks good, natural and doesn't rub off if sweating or swimming, but it does on fingers if touched on the scalp. A little goes a long way; the trick is to blend it in. I've noticed that its drying to my hair so I use some jojoba oil on the hair afterward."
2,not great for women,"I don't know if it's because I have longer hair, but it was hard to get it on my scalp without getting all over my roots and the rest of my hair. It left my hair waxy and sticky. Also, the product never seemed to dry and I would get it all over my hands any time I touched my hair/head."
2,its like colour,Well i saw the video of couvre and i thought i found a solution of my baldness but its not happen when i use it my pillow covers are turn black my towel are turn black.peoples are also found out that use some kind of paint.I don't find it useful for me.
4,Hair Miracle,"This product is amazing. It provides maximum coverage and lasts until I wash my hair again. This along with the hair fibers keeps me in tact. The application is messy, it takes time to apply, but once you're done you're good to go!"
3,I Remember Kwame!,"I couldn't give more than three stars because it has been years since I heard these songs. I just remember how much I liked his videos and the funny way he dressed. He wore those big suits and had that funky high-top fade. Thinking of this feels like a class reunion. I actually feel old because I was a kid when this came out. No one hardly remembers Kwame but I do. He had talent. This is a good CD for lovers of 90's music. EIGHT songs huh? You can tell this was made when cassette tapes were popular. Ha, ha!"
3,Great electric broom,"I own an earlier version of this machine (w/o the final X in the model number) and have been very pleased with it. It is well engineered (I bought it to replace one that blew the exhaust downward, blowing away dust and dirt before you could get to it!), light weight, and easy to maneuver, and is excellent for quick pickups on bare floors or low-pile rugs. I like the cord storage (easy to get it off the hooks and into action), and the dust bag replacement is easy. It works like a charm on dog hair, dust bunnies, spilled kitty litter, or crumbs on the floor (or in the bed). You can also remove the brush and use the bare nozzle to dust the tops of baseboards, etc.As an electric broom, I'd give it 4 or 5 stars. But it should not be mistaken for a general purpose vacuum cleaner. It is a very satisfactory secondary tool."
1,Absolute junk!,This is waste of $24.99. I guess I will add it to my junk pile. It's not worth the shipping price to send it back.
2,A Good Piece of Junk Cheap,"If you buy this, don't even think about using it on rugs unless they are less than 1/4 in thick. It does work fairly well on flat surfaces. The pink plastic guards fall off the first time you use it, but don't worry they are useless and the machine will suck them in so there is no mess. It makes a good quickie clean up for flat tiles surfaces, but thats about it.The only reason I didn't send it back was that we have tiled kitchens and baths. It is useful on these surfaces and has a small footprint. It doesn't need recharging and takes up little space. DeLonghi makes good products, but this one should have its intended purpose updated. Thanks."
1,"bad art, jumbled story","Vampires and nonsense. The naked women are badly drawn. I read this thing four times. It makes no sense . I ended up taking it out to the outhouse to use when I ran out of corn cobs. I hate the republican ideaology that is behind this reactionary pamplet. This kind of subliminal misinformation is whats wrong with arcane theories of one world economy and covert globalization. In Martin County we take our politics a little more seriously than either of these two liberal weirdos. I do not support the race mixing theory in between the pages. A black jesus isn't historically accurate and the supposidly WWII facts says little about the life of Adolph Hitler, a truly great man.Skip it and buy mein kampf instead."
4,The story of submarines.,"A nice story of the development of the submarine. I didn't think there was much of a story here until I read the book. This a nice concise summary of the history of submarines, complete with great illustrations and pictures. The perspective is British throughout, since this is a BBC book. It details the development of the submarine from the Revolutionary War to present times. This book leaves out the exploits of the Hunley, the Confederate submarine which sank a Union frigate. I found this kind of poor writing, since the Confederate submarine was one of the first to prove its ability as a military weapon. Other than that, the author does a good job detailing the development of this military weapon. The author also adds a chapter for the scientific and economic value submarines may hold for the future.If the reader is looking for a book detailing the development of the submarine, this is a great read. It supports a major television documentary on submarines. Good reading."
5,GREAT TOE RING FOR THE PRICE,This ring is a terrific buy. I got more compliments on this ring than any other I purchased from any other seller. Absolutely satisfied!!!!!!!!
1,"Even if you're a fan, don't bother","Don't get me wrong...I really dig Lloyd's stuff and I have every album. And it is a forgivable sin for Lloyd to venture into the land of strange experimentation. I'm not holding a grudge. If you are a lloyd cole fan, you'll want to stay away from this CD. I think this music is his attempt to write film scores, or write music to nap to, or something like that. If you're looking for melody, you won't find it here. This is Lloyd in New England writing new age stuff with the help of a computer and some recording software. While the recent ""Etc"" is very listenable, Plastic Wood is something that you'll end up selling on eBay for a buck. Sorry, Lloyd. It just ... Still love ya, though!"
2,Sub titles suck,Was looking forward to seeing this movie from decades past. Was not happy that I had to sit and watch BRIGHT YELLOW subtitles throughout the movie - very distracting.
5,"To Sir, With Love, VHS tape",The tape came quickly and was very accurately described. It was in excellent condition. Thanks.
4,Heartwarming Film,"Poitier is a stunning actor.This is a heartwarming film. This is a good feel-good movie for anyone who may be feeling down!Jeffrey C. McAndrewauthor of ""Our Brown-Eyed Boy"""
5,Good role for Sidney Poitier,"Sidney Poitier plays an idealistic new teacher in a rough London high school, where the kids are used to browbeating the faculty. He gets nothing but disrespect and abuse, until he decides to focus on life skills instead of academics they may never need. He gets involved in their lives outside of school, and the students gradually come to respect and even love him. The film follows him through one school year, which may be his last.This movie is pretty predictable - hardened delinquents are changed forever by the devotion of a young teacher - but has never been done better. Poitier has such charm and charisma that you will really enjoy and believe every minute. He brings warmth, honesty, and dignity to the role. I recommend this film to his many fans, to future teachers who also want to change the world, and to everyone who was once a student and had a special teacher who cared about them.Kona"
5,Great Movie - Problem with the DVD,"This is a fine classic movie: others have reviewed it more expertly than I could, so I will confine my remarks to the DVD I received through my Amazon order.I did not view it for about two months after receiving it. When I did watch it, I found that Side A, the full screen version, played fine. Side B, which promised a widescreen version, instead contained an entirely different movie: a dubbed version of a Japanese film 'Godzilla vs. Space Godzilla.' I am completely at a loss.So, buy the DVD, but check out Side B."
5,Just plain good,"Excellent movie, story, and acting. This is one of the few movies that I can truly say I've never forgotten. My wife still can't believe I love ""Sir"" and everytime it comes on TV, I'll stop to watch. I don't buy many videos, but this is one of the few I did buy."
5,SIDNEY'S FINEST PERFORMANCE,"This is easily my favorite film of all time. Of course I'm very biased. Great story and excellent performances by all. I've collected all of his films and this is,arguably,the best of his performances. I Would say that his performance in IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT or THE DEFIANT ONES would rate second."
5,Those School-Girl days..............,"This movie was a powerful portrayal of a teacher who truly loves the profession. The students that ""Sir"" had to teach were quite difficult to reach and unruly. But Sir was determined to touch thier lives and he did! They in turn touched his life. I was truly inspired by this movie, considering that I too am a teacher! An excellent moive."
1,Region 2 DVD,This DVD was a Region 2 DVD which cannot be played on the DVD players sold in the western hemisphere. No where in the ad posted on Amazon.com was this mentioned.
5,Love this movie!!!,To Sir With Love is an oldie but a goodie. I have loved this movie forever and am really glad to have it on my puter now. Thanks Amazon.
2,Good movie but boring,Good movie but boring. The message is good. He's a great actor. But I couldn't find the patience to sit through the whole thing and after about 1/4 fast forwarded through it. The class room scene was getting tiring after a while and I'm no fan of conflict.
1,Total Rip-Off by Rave-Imports--BUT AMAZON MADE IT RIGHT,"This item was purchased by me in the USA. When I put it in my machine, it said, ""Cannot be used in your region."" Later I found out that it is not able to be used in the USA. Rave-Imports wanted me to send it back for a $2.50 refund (50%). I am very dissatisfied with that response. Gas alone to get to the post office plus my time to repackage it....is not happening. The item will go in the trash can. Amazon, however did credit me back the money spent. I have been very pleased with Amazon and will continue using them....however ONLY ORDER DVD'S THAT SAY REGION 1."
5,Love Love Love,"From the first time I saw this movie I have loved it. Sidney Poitier, I just can't bring to words what his acting does to me in this movie. He never lost his cool even though those were some bad a*s kids. The dance at the end between him and his student and the song by Lulu are my favorite scenes. I recommend that everyone buys this movie you will not be disappointed."
2,OVERPRICED,"Although the film is excellent (I have it in VHS), $38.95 is an OUTRAGEOUS price to pay for it simply because it is no longer being manufactured. Don't be taken advantage of . . . send em a message and refuse to buy it!"
1,sidney poitier is excellent,"an excellent performance by sidney poitier who takes up the roll of mr.braithwaite , a courageous nergro scool teacher caught in the tweezer grip of prejudice in london ,and who narrates his story brilliantly,...if you were a negro you would find merely existing would provide you with more excitement than you would ever care for... he further writes ....had you been pimp pansy or moron it would not have mattered if you had been saved from the greatest sin of all, the sin of being born black.... that was england shortly after the great world war 2, after demobilisation from the RAF the glorious undying few .a true story ofcorse. capt yeshwanth raj at chennai , india email:yeshwant@md3.vsnl.net.in"
4,Great old classic!,"This Movie brings back the old simple ways of movies and the times they represented. Sidney Poitier showed ,even in 1960's, England had it's beliefs and attitudes towards race w/o playing the ""race Card""."
5,a keeper? absolutely!,"this is poitier's best film. the song ""to sir with love"" by lulu actually shot to the top tem because of this film (imho) everyone in the movie is brilliant. buy it and watch it over and over .... very good for current youth today in our society. this movie is TIMELESS!"
4,enjoyed it,"Forgot how much I liked this movie, and now my daughter does too. A story that is still valid today."
5,My grandfather's favorite movie,I bought this DVD for my grandfather's birthday. I know he was very happy and touched to get it. I'm sure he has watched it more than once already.
5,To Sir With Love Is Wonderful,This is an inspiring movie. When we treat each other with respect and dignity wonderful things are accomplished.
5,my favorite hair product,"smells delicious of almonds, yet not too strong; untangles messy wet hair; doesn't leave hair greasy and clumped together; i love it."
3,Too Many Glitchs,"It is suppose to fire .177 pellets and BB's but it's really only a BB Gun. Shooting the BB's that came with it, the gun had a very wide spray pattern. Using the pellets that came with it, the pistol would miss fire and even Jam. When it would fire pellets it had a fairly tight shot pattern. I bought some Destroyer pellets (By Crosman)and many of the pellets fit too loosly in the magazine and would cause the gun to jam. When firing ""Daisy"" BB's it had a much tighter shot pattern than with the crosman BB's. I also bought a Crosman laser sight and that was a joke. It wouldn't stay focused, and quit working before the 2nd Co2 cartrige was half empty. I then bought a NcStar Red Dot Laser sight and it works great. If you want a Pellet Gun then buy a Pellet Gun. If you want a BB Gun then this one will do if you are content with only a 8 Shot Magazine."
1,This gun stinks,"This gun is worthless. You can't even sight it in. When firing pellets from 20 feet with hands steadied on a block of wood, it shoots in about a 4 inch circle, random distribution, with an occasional pellet as much as 6 inches off. Spend some money. Buy a better gun. You get what you pay for."
2,Crosman 1088 Horrible choice!!!,I just purchased this gun and I'm in total agreement with the marine... This pistol (expecially for the pricetag) is a huge dissapointment...The power of the pistol being one of them...also as the other man described HORRIBLE accuracy and a huge pain to sight in... the magnetic piece in the center of the mag I also think is just retarded.. The only thing that is good is the look and feel of the pistol...so far no seal problems but hey give it a few days!! Not even a good pistol for target practice!!! PLEASE don't make the same mistake and shop elsewhere for an overall better pistol...

DonovanCalifornia Bookwatch"
4,A Secret Too Good to Keep,"This wonderful little book (perfectly sized for a pocket) about Ottawa, ""Secret Ottawa,"" does what most travel books fail to do: it tells you about the out-of-the-way, low fanfare places that are probably better than the tourist traps to begin with.From bookstores, to candle stores, to statues with mistakes, to swans in the river, and cats on Parliament Hill, this book is a gem for those wanting to explore some of the real side of Ottawa, not just the stuff on postcards. This book tells nearly everything that makes Ottawa beautiful, instead of just another city."
2,Too small,"I guess you get what you pay for. Actually, not. There was no measurement online-I was worried it'd be too small in diameter and it is. It only fits my Hoyo de Monterreys (a good fit, none the less) Wouldn't recommend it unless you stick to slimmer stogies"
3,Good for the price,We bought this item a little while ago and find that it's a very reliable little heating pad. It certainly does its job. The chord is pretty stiff and could be uncomfortable for some.
5,"Chintzy, but the cat loves it.","I bought this for my aging cat, and despite the warnings (""Don't use this for animals""), I've used it and he's loved it. On the lowest setting, it is warm without hotspots, and when wrapped in a towel, it provides a very subtle, even heat. The controller is large, and I could see how someone with arthritic fingers might have an easier time operating it. The single slider moves easily, and there is a bright red LED to indicate that the unit is on, just in case you can't tell by touch. Overall construction seems a bit chintzy - cheap plastic with a flimsy fabric cover, but as long as it continues to do the job, I won't complain."
1,Be Warned...,"I ordered this heating pad to warm blankets and towels for my newborn, but was sorely disapponted to find a tag on the cord that read, ""The power cord on this product contains lead... wash hands after handling."" It's made in China, so I really shouldn't be surprised, but I wish there had been a disclaimer in the item description."
1,FIRE HAZARD NO STARS (only gave it one star because rating is required),"DO NOT BUY THIS HEATING PAD! I read the other reviewer's comments about this pad going on fire. I had the same experience last night. I have a mild rib injury which is helped by heat. I sat down to watch the evening news and put the heating pad on the area. About two minutes after turning it on, the cord (where it attaches to the control) sparked and burst into flames. I jumped up quickly and disconnected it from the outlet which stopped the fire and sparks. The arm of my $800 Berkline recliner was burned and a small spot on the carpet was damaged. I was not hurt. It happened so quickly and without warning. I plan on reporting it to our local consumer products agency."
2,No auto shut off,"This was a real disappointment. It heats up fairly quickly, which is nice. However it has NO auto shutoff. When I realized it was I accurately described I thought I'd return it, but decided it wasn't that important. Mistake. More than once I thought this as turned off and the slider did not register all the way to the off position. It is dangerous and I will be replacing it."
4,Not bad for the price.,"I got this heating pad a few weeks ago and I think it works fine for what I spent on it. I don't like the new plastic smell it gives off. But I usually have it under a blanket anyways. The low settings are barely warm at all so I keep it on the 5th and highest settings and it's toasty. I do have a problem with ordering it via Amazon though. They kept changing the due date before I got it and the customer service I got was horrible. One customer service person said they would keep me informed with email updates regarding the delivery and I never heard back from them. If I had a chance to go back and order this item again, I would probably order it through someone else and spare myself the poor customer service."
1,Bad Quality,"I bought the Sunbeam heating pad and 1 years later it has some serious issues with functioning. It only heats placed in certain position and also the controller gets stuck and the only way to reset is to pull the plug and hold the controller also in a certain position to work. I think this is bad quality, given that we only occassionally used it. Don't Buy."
4,Made in China.,"One little snap holds the basic cotton cover over a plastic pad. It would be better if the cover was held more securely onto the pad. But for the price, it's fine. The biggest plus: it doesn't turn off automatically after two hours, which for me, makes a heating pad pretty worthless (as I like to put it at the foot of my bed to keep my feet warm at night). It isn't very large but it does the trick. The heating adjustment has a super bright red light when the heat is turned on. Heating adjustment for high, medium or low is achieved with a slide, so all you do is push it up or down, which would be a plus for those who have difficulty turning dials."
4,works well,"I was looking for a heating pad that did not have auto shut off. This one does not have it. Also, the switch is very easy to adjust. I own 3 of these heating pads, and will continue to buy them as long as they are available."
1,Unreliable,This is a horribly unreliable product. I have it for less than a month. It has already stopped working. It'll cost me more just to send it back for a replacement.
3,heats well but controls are cheap,"This heating pad heats up fast and is doing the job, but the controls feel like cheap plastic. I wonder if it will break quickly. Also, the low and medium settings are slightly different, but medium to high settings is a big jump in heat. I will adjust by using an extra cloth to temper the heat."
5,Sunbeam Heating Pad with Arthritic Controller,"This is an excellent product that has easy to set controller, even heat and is very dependable. It is perfect for my Cat's Bed and her Kitty Condo. I have two heating pads. She is spoiled, but she just goes and curls up and it is very comforting to her. It is so much better for her than other brands that automatically turn off in a couple of hours. The ""on light"" is easily seen so it can be turned off when not in use. Thanks for a great product. I wholeheartedly recommend it for whatever your use would be. Eugene N. Limon, Loveland, Colorado"
3,Warming pad,Got these to provide a warm spot for some homeless cats in an enclosure by my garage. I chose these because they stay on continuously. They do not get very warm even on a bed of foil backed styrofoam. But better than nothing.
5,Thrilled!,"The stores only carry auto shut off heating pads, I was glad to find one that didn't have that feature. We are using it on our birds cage when he is sick."
2,not nearly hot enough,this item was cheap and stays on as expected but even on it's high setting barely gets hot enough to notice.
4,GOOD BASIC HEATING PAD,"This is a basic heating pad with a 3 setting slide controller. We selected it because it specifically does NOT have automatic shutoff. The size is fine for most uses.Anyone wishing different features can see what Sunbeam manufactures at the sunbeam . com website.We specifically downgraded this one to 4* because the low setting seems too warm. We think the pad would benefit from more choices of heat settings.That being said, this is still a reasonable heating pad.Recommended with reservations."
4,Good basic hating pad...,"I agree with the review ""Good basic heating pad at a bargain price."" This appears to be the least expensive heating pad around,but it's definitely cheaply made. It helps to loosely sew the cover together because the plastic cover on the pad is so flimsy it scrunches up really bad when hot. I hate the automatic OFF feature most pads have now, and this one doesn't have that, so it stays uniformly hot until I'm through with it (also great for my chihuahua on winter nights)."
1,Junk,This is a crappy plastic cover that wrinkles and then overheats. Plus the wire connections inside are large and uncomfortable
2,Not great for back pain relief,"I know there are a few reviews by people who bought this for their pet and gave it good reviews. But my review is for people that want to use it for back pain relief, and that does not warrant a good review.The high heat setting is probably good enough, although it could be a tad hotter. The big problem here is that the heat does not stay on. It constantly ""pulses"" on and off every 5 minutes or so. So you don't get steady heat to your back.This pad is also a mess after you have used it. The ""bag"" that it is in is impossible to straighten out after it has been used. I try my best, and get it as flat as possible, but there are still many, many wrinkles in it. Very poor design.The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is the price. It certainly is a good price. But you do get what you pay for. I would not recommend this for somebody looking for a heating pad for back pain."
5,Excellent heating-pad!,"Excellent price, too!I use heating-pads to give my pets their own heating options. A warm-corner for everyone: parrots, cats, bees, etc. And heating-pads are excellent for those needing some first-aid. I have priced, and tried, all sorts of heating-pads. I do not need timers, or automatic-offs, or special-coverings, or pockets. Nor do I appreciate-it when the heating-element fails after 3 months. This heating-pad strongly heats at high, medium, and low. It's handle/dial is simple and easy. If you have a special-condition you may need a $25-$40 heating-pad, but for simple, reliable, safe, spot-heating, this item does an excellent job at the most reasonable price. Recommend!"
2,Whatever happened to the good old fashioned heating pads?,"What a disappointment -- this has lasted me through a dozen uses and now it barely heats at all. The plastic cover makes it hard to contour to the affected area, which in this case is my arm. I thought Sunbeam was a reputable company, but this is dreadful. Now I'm looking for a heating pad that's NOT made by Sunbeam."
5,"Good product, great price on a heating pad","We were looking for a heating pad that did NOT have an automatic shut off. Most do, and it's used for our old arthritic cat (indoors). We can't get her off of it...and we just keep it set on low.She says it ""purrrrrrr-fect""."
3,Disappointment,"I have been using an old (40 or 50 year-old) heating pad,.so I thought I'd better update. This new one was not even as nice as my old one. The pad doesn't seem very pliable and kind of gathers in ""lumps."" It works. Just disappointing."
4,Quality and price = great value,"My 86 year old mother, who insists on her independence and remaining in her home, has several age related joint problems that require heat for relief. On a daily phone call I found her old heating pad had stopped working, and she wasn't up to going out to a store to purchase a new one. I searched for the best deals on a Sunbeam (a brand my Mom insists is the best), and landed on Amazon's page with several Sunbeam heating pads to choose from. For the problems associated with my mother's needs, this Sunbeam Health at Home 756-500 fit the bill. While her mind is still clear, she does struggle with electronics that offer too many buttons and options. The price was right, with my Prime account it was delivered in 2 days, and Mom is happy again; which is priceless."
2,Be careful...the price is not what it seems,Initially this heating pad seemed like a good value. A simple yet effective heating pad for $12. Even with a shipping cost of $4.0 the economics makes sense. However you find that Ace Hardware tacks on another $5.0 for handling. Unless you are watching very carefully your $12.00 heating pad ends up costing $21 because of shipping and handling of $9.0!
2,cords are 2 stiff to bend,"they work, but the cords are so stiff they are hard to bend...if cords was a lot more flexable i would give them a 4 star rating, and i bought 2 of these...going to look for some others"
3,756-500 Standard Heating Pad from Amazon,I was thrilled to receive my Heat Pad and took it away on holiday with me so that I could use it on my shoulder which had recently had a tendon repair. I needed it to help with pain relief. Imagine my great disappointment when I found the plug was not compatable in New Zealand. I would have thought knowing where the item is being sent and to be used that it would come ready to use for that country. I should have sent it back instead decided to take it to have a new plug put on so that I could use. Unfortunately for me the engineer that was to do the work removed the plug and prepared the wires for a replacement plug before he read the fact that it wasn't compatable for 240V. I now have a heat pad that is unusable and unreturnable due to the fact it is not in the original condition.I suggest everyone who is purchasing items that you check if it is compatable for your use in your country. That was my mistake
3,Average Basic Heating Pad,"This heating pad is of average quality.Cons:* I don't like the blue cover, it's an uncomfortable polyester fabric.* It hums and is kind of annoying if you are using near your head.Pros:* 3 heat settings.* Fast heat-up.* Long cord, 9 feet long.* Good basic size, 12"" x 15"".It does not have auto-shut off. I didn't list that under pros or cons because it depends on what you are looking for.Overall, it's a fine heating pad but I like a cotton cover much better."
2,Not so great,"This was a replacement for a much earlier version of this heating pad, which I owned for years. This doesn't get as hot or stay hot long enough. I am disappointed. I guess that's we get now that things are coming from China. I'm not a xenophobe and I'm very well-traveled. I just don't think there is any quality control in that country as proven by this product (and many others.)I know this is inexpensive but so was my last one; and I was very satisfied with that for many, many years."
1,SAFTY WARNING/FIRE HAZARD!!!,"WARNING--FIRE HAZARD!!! After less than one month of use I began smelling an electrical burning smell when using the heating pad. I looked at the control switch and actually saw the control switch visibly smoking, and it was hot to the touch. I immediately unplugged the heating pad and unscrewed the controller unit, noting that the hot lead where it contacted the plastic inside the controller had been charred. This is very scary as I had been using the heating pad for the entire time and all night long while sleeping in bed--thank God that I noticed the smoking controller unit during the daytime as there is no doubt in my mind that this could have caused a life threatening fire had I had not caught it!!! DON""T BUY THIS!!!! Amazon has a good product return policy that I am taking advantage of. I would give this heating pad zero stars if that were possible."
4,Good value for the price,"Extended back pain from a recurring injury pushed me into buying a heating pad and this Sunbeam has done the job admirably. Although it seems like pads from a few years ago got warmer, this product has not only been used to relieve muscle soreness, it's also found its way onto our couch and into the bed on cold nights."
5,A Wonderful Book --Particularly for those in the SF Bay Area,"This is a good book both for the avid gardener as well as the beginner. I've given this book as gifts to many people throughout the SF Bay area and everyone has loved this book!It is particularly a good gift if they grow vegetables and have had limited success in some aspects of gardening such as trying to grow tomotoes the coastal areas of the Bay Area. This book has growing charts of when to plant and harvest, best varieties for the bay area, and covers points to explain the many microclimates even within the same city.A great book with lots of pointers. Note that this is not a book to compete with Sunset's Western Garden Book but rather to supplement it. This book doesn't have the details with regard to horticultural specifics."
5,Fantastic -- BUT DON'T BUY IT!,"$90 for new copies of this? Don't bother. It's been released again in 2010 under a slightly different title for around $20. Buy that one. Do a search for:Golden Gate Gardening: The Complete Guide to Year-Round Food Gardening in the San Francisco Bay Area and Coastal Californiaby Pam Peirce(Note the spelling of the name.)Otherwise, FANTASTIC BOOK. You'll love it. Even with details like the soil in San Francisco being full of lead from all the paint over the years on the Victorians and so on, so recommending new soil or raised beds with new soil (raised beds are always a plus for growing food anyway since they heat up better than the ground and produce more stellar results, sometimes quicker and sometimes for a longer period of time)."
4,"Great product, does just what is expected","I've used heat-mounted products for decades and this product is a solid performer. I heat-mount digital photographs to plywood and then cut into jigsaw puzzles. Heat-mounting (185 degrees F) is the only tried-and-true method for this process and the Colormount product by Bienfang does the job perfectly. Downsides? The nature of the product doesn't allow re-positioning or re-mounting but that's really not a slam against it... once it's attached, it STAYS attached - - and that's really a GOOD thing!"
3,I don't care for the embossed bottom of the skillet,"The bottom of the skillet is embossed with a large commemorative ""Lewis & Clark Corps of Discovery"" embellishment. You may really like this, you may think it's tacky (like me, thus my middling score) or you may not care at all. See the picture I uploaded to decide for yourself before buying it."
2,Poor shipping for this item,This product which is relatively heavy was shipped to me in a box without much packing material. This allowed the skillet to move around and caused it to arrive with the secondary handle & a portion of the skillet broken off. I think I will shop for this item locally.
4,One thing to iron out -,"Purchased this item because of a high rating from America's Test Kitchen. It does come pre-tempered from the factory (in China). Nice skillet, but my only problem is the logos cast into the bottom of the pan. I use an electric stove and (with the cast logos) it does not sit stable on the burner. You have to ""hunt"" for a position that it will not rock. I am actually looking to get the logo milled off the bottom at a machine shop. Other than that, it is a heavy skillet that should last generations with proper care."
4,good skillet,"it performs well, I like it, it conducts heat very well, better than the coated pans, the only thing is it needs a heat-insulating handle"
3,"Wacky, Simple Comedy","I directed ""a.k.a. Marleen"" (one of the selections) for a High School Theater group, and it was a successful, funny show. Don't expect anything mindblowing, but do expect some quick-witted, quality laughs. Comic timing is a must for all actors performing these plays; the script gives actors and directors plenty of freedom. A good choice if you like working without a net."
3,The Screen is a wee big smaller than the original,"Firstly let me say the seller was excellent - product arrived right away earlier than stated. When I mounted the screen on the frame, it was perhaps 1/20"" shorter than the original ones I had,making it not click snugly into position, and slips inward when pressure is applied by the face to the mesh."
4,It was what it was…,…but I think it will soon be time to get a new razor for these parts seem to be getting harder to find!
1,Wanna throw your money in the trash?,"Warning Amazon friends! Wanna throw your money in the trash? If you do, buy this! I never felt so obligated to write a review. I bought this shaver from a retail store 30 minutes ago. I thought i'd put it through a test by trimming my chin hair into a manicured gotee. This clipper failed miserably! I needed to run the clipper over the same spot over 5 times to get a cut and even then not all the hairs were cut. The blades are not sharp and i felt a lot of hair pulling. Well guess what, this trimmer went straight into the trash after 30 minutes of ownership."
4,"Good Quality ""Touch-up"" Kit","Although its a labeled as a travel kit, I use it every other day to touch-up my facial hair and once a week to trim the nose hairs. Has lasted exactly one year today and works great. I've only used Remington for my shaving needs and they've never disappointed me. I'll probably buy another one for when I drop this and break the tip like I did with my shaver."
2,you get what u pay 4,"The product is ok and does its job, except that the 2 guide combs that provide the different trimming lengths BREAK VERY EASILY, therefore, making the trimmer useless, if you want it for a specific grooming length. In addition, I felt like ""DUH"" when I entered a Wal-Mart and saw the same exact thing for $12.95! So I pay $14.99 plus $5.43 shipping for a total of $20.42, more expensive then having bought it at the store, and then to top it off, it breaks! Oh well, you get what you pay for."
1,Wrong image!!,I am actually quite disappointed with this order as the image shown on Amazon.com (it seems it is Remington's TLG-100) is totally different from the model that I have received (Remington's TLG-200). They are indeed quite different products and I am sorry to say that this is the worst online shopping experience I have ever had --- getting something that I don't expect!
1,Product did not work. Useless,"The product came quickly but when it arrived it was flimsy. I put the required batteries in, after having to go and purchase them, but the groomer did not work.You only get caught once. Never again"
3,"Fascinating descriptions, so-so story","3-3.5 starsThis did not turn out anything like what I had expected after reading the first 200 pages. It was interesting for its detail of locations and time and the day-to-day life of poor farmers but I don't plan to read anything else by this author. As others have said, the end was sudden and disjointed from the rest, especially after seeing such detail and slow development over a period of a year or so for the rest of the book. At times I was just exasperated while reading, wondering if it was going to get anywhere."
5,I love this book,"I just loved this book. It went in such a different direction than I was expecting, but I loved it. The story sort of broke my heart, but it was so thoughtful. I think her writing style is wonderful. It was one of those books that I was sad when I was done with it because I was enjoying reading it so much. It's high up on my list of favorite books that I've ever read."
3,Somewhat disappointing,"This is an interesting story of the early notoriety and heartbreak that surrounded the family of North America's first live birth quins, and an equally interesting study of how everyday people can be drawn into the excitement and tragedy of such an event. Descriptions of the times and early media interest are well done, but as the book progresses and the family sinks into tragedy, I feel the story loses some of its impact, and I struggled to finish the story.This is not to say that the characters are unsympathetic, or that the reader cannot identify with their plight, but more that as they struggle to deal with their lives, interest in their lives begins to wane.Sheri Holman's ""The Mammoth Cheese"" deals with a similar topic in modern times, but is by far the better book in my opinion."
2,A slow paced book that never achieves its full potential,"Although this book is admirable for its accurate and realistic recreation of turn-of-the-century Kentucky and the vivid characterization of Christie Wheeler, the book ultimately is unsatisfying because it progresses at such a slow pace and only sporadically engages the reader's interest. Furthermore, the book's concluding sections are especially weak. They lack depth, development and seem rather disjointed from the rest of the novel, which is highly detailed and complete."
2,"Lacking eggs, caterpillar, colors","Michigan Butterflies and Skippers: A Field Guide and Reference (Michigan Butterflies & Skippers)I was very disappointed when I received this book. Very few of the butterflies / skippers include photos of the caterpillar or eggs. The last entry for each shows the upper and bottom wingspan of both the male and female, almost all of which are shades of brown for some reason. An earlier photo at the head of each entry shows the b / s in full color.The book must have been a labor of love over many years. Technical information is very complete. You'd have to look elsewhere though for the eggs / caterpillar / colors."
3,Some good songs but....,"silly tracks like ""The warriors prayer"" ruin what could be an excellent CD. After reading the reviews on the various Manowar albums, I chose this one since it was so highly regarded. If this is the best they have to offer, I think I'll pass on the other CDs. Don't get me wrong, it is not a bad disc and is worth having. Wheels of Fire, Kings of Metal, Hail and Kill, and Blood of the kings are very good (especially Hail and kill). If they had a release that had 10 songs like these, they would have a great CD on their hands."
5,Hail,"This is an old (1980's) album that I purchased so I could finally listen to it on my CD player in my truck. Been a fan of this band for many, many years. Into Glory Ride!"
2,Obnoxiously cheesy.,"I used to like this album but then I got sick of it because of this band's tastelessly cheesy antics. ""Warrirs prayer"" made me cringe every time I heard it. Next to everything released by Bal Sagoth, that is one of the cheesiest tracks I've heard on a metal album. The lyrics are typical Manowar arrogance in which Eric Adams boasts about how they're ""real metal"" and other bands are not. It's tiring. Manowar starting doing that since the New wave of British Heavy metal days and their still doing it! Well, I'm done. Personally, I would recommend anything by Kamelot if someone wants to listen to some cheesy power metal with some good taste and intelligence."
2,Wheels of fire burning bright?,"""We live to ride!"" If you can listen to the first track, as well as ""The warriors prayer"" without busting out laughing, then you have problems of a serious nature. ""A great hammer of war!"" ""Who were they? THEY WERE THE METAL KINGS!"" Jesus - I can't take it anymore. Recommended to be listened to while under the influence of naturally growing psychoactive drugs that are smoked out of a water filled glass apparatus."
1,Totally bummed out,This album was totally NOT what I expected. What's with all the Ren Faire stuff? I wanted unbridled gore! I wanted eyeball songs! Where can I find that among all this broccoli? Manowar USED to be the thinking man's Virgin Steele. What happened?
2,There's a song..,"On here called Pleasure Slave. It talks about woman needing nothing more than to suck ManOwar. Muscles aside, any good music is seriously just undermined by that. I dug some of their stuff. I have their jacket,shirts. Racial crap on Violence and Bloodshed shrugged to but nomore..Guess there venting. I'll listen to the album and see if I can change my mind. Had to delete good ""Fighting the World review. Give it a shot, and see if they change..Extra star given for ""Defenders"" on ""fighting.""..Could just be a venting.."
4,"The best ""Viking"" metal album","In the long history of heavy metal there have been many,many strange bands, with outrageous behavior, ideas and style. But none of them are as serious about their particular style than Manowar. i do not know if there is a classification as viking metal but if there is they are the best by a mile. Did they watched Conan the Barbarian way too many times? Possibly. Is their music full of violence and bloodshed? You bet. But that cannot and do not takes away from the fact that these guys are talented and they enjoy what they do. Silly ? Maybe. Powerful? No doubt about. Is an experience. All hail the kings of metal!"
5,Awesome!,"Manowar proofs once again that they're the kings of metal. This album is simply amazing.The first song is like in so many other Manowar albums, a shout, a shout to make the people aware of the return of Manowar. King of Metal is a great song, having the audience shouting parts of the chorus it makes for a great song to be played live.Heart of Steel is a masterpiece, greta singing by Adams!After that we get a great guitar solo, and then the very artistic Crown and The Rind. After that the hymn Kingdom Come which is very moody. Track seven features a bonus track called Pleasure Slave which has some great guitars.And the comes Hail and Kill, a classic, probably one of the best songs of all time. After follows The Warriors Prayer, a non-instrumental track where we hear an old man telling a story about the four metal kings. Vlood of the Kings is the awesome closing track of the album. It's full of power and emotion.Manowar, everything fits together."
4,The Kings of Cheese ride again.,"Are you ready for the power of the True Metal? If not, then you had best stay well away from this most powerful offering from the...well, I dare not mention them by name lest I inadvertently call down a thunderbolt from Valhalla. Such is the power of this band. Onward, Brothers of True Metal!"
1,Not what it appears to be,"I was looking up Ray Stevenson who is in a version of this movie (along w/ Clive Owen and Catherine Zeta-Jones), this came up so I purchased it only to find it's a some homemade looking film. It looks like a high school production but I think even a high school kid could do better. Want my money back!"
5,Best Short Biography Of John Gill,"Given the relative lack of biographical information on this great servant of God, This is certainly the best short treatment of the subject. Rippon followed Gill in his pulpit and was in a better position to know him than any other biographer to date. George Ella has a supurb long biography called ""John Gill and the Cause of Truth"" (NOT to be confused with Gill's own book ""The Cause of God and Truth"") but it may not be easily available as it was printed in England. But, this is a must for anyone who has been blessed by the solid gopel truths of Gill."
1,Another World,I disagree with the other reviewers. I Love HarlequinIntrigue books....however this one did nothing for me.Title seems right on the nose. To bad this could havebeen a good mystery !I believe that is why there are so many differencesin our world today.
3,Neither fantastic nor terrible.,"Levert's third album for Atlantic Records was neither as satisfying nor as powerful as its two predecessors (1986's ""Bloodline"" and 1987's ""The Big Throwdown"") but it nonetheless has its bright moments. As was to be expected from a late-1980s release, the Hip-Hop and New Jack Swing influences are noticeable but Gerald Levert was always a great singer in his own right and that alone manages to make even the trendy uptempo Dance tunes enjoyable. While it would be unrealistic to expect Levert to have been doing the kind of material The O'Jays were doing at the time, Levert's previous releases had a stronger O'Jays influence than this 1988 release."
2,died after 1 year of operation,"Bought it May 28th, 2011. stopped working in July of 2012.Unit just shuts off about once a week. I bought this to connect to my cable TV box to prevent it from restarting everytime the power goes out for 30seconds. Had a thunderstorm the other day, power went out for 5second and this unit shut off, battery backup no longer works.Calling Tripplite tech support, its suppose to have a 3 year warranty"
1,A big mistake,"I selected this text for my undergraduate analysis class. It was a big mistakeit starts out nice and chatty and ""friendly"" but the author soon buries thematerial in detailed tangential remarks. Particularly annoying ishis comparing exercises to many previous ( and future!!) problems inthe text. Togetherbwith the remarks the text grinds to a halt tryingto leaf back and forth to reference them. My students found this bookto be very difficult. Even simple things to prove he sometimes refersthe reader to previous material. My students need help on simplethings involving series say. He includes so many different ratio testsfor example and then has few straightforward probs for them to do.It was an ordeal selecting problemsfor them to do.Many of the easy ones he refers them to previous probs inthe text so the student refers back to the earlier solution insteadof proving it himself. A really bad experience!"
1,A suffocating read.,"Bunch of lies the two reviewers gave. I bought the book, tried to learn from it, and ended up hating the book. I realized pretty fast that the book is like any ordinary real analysis book: routine restated theorems, routine common simple problems, routine impossibly hard exercises, and routinely almost zero help from the back of the book. Sure, sure...I needed help from this book for a class using a different book while that book is presented exactly the same way as this book. I know for sure that this book or any book on real analysis anywhere is set out to doom my head to never ending death of my desire in mathematics. Can't anybody publish a book called ""Real Analysis for Dummies""? Cause I surely need to buy that book."
3,This is a good book...but,"The idea of this book is great - you are sitting in front of Rudin, you have no idea what to do and all of a sudden you open this book and things become clear! Umm, not quite. First, this book has had problems with a multitude of typos (see the author's web site). Second, the title is stupid. There is no such thing as a 'friendly introduction to analysis'. That's an oxymoron if ever there was one. This book is very good at explaining basic ideas and giving you some insights BUT IT STILL AIN'T RUDIN (and its discussion/proofs of convergence tests is weak since they all link back to geometric sums and that is not mentioned here). If you want to study analysis you eventually have to make large pot of coffee, put butt in chair, take out pencil and a raft of paper and start working - without tv, ipod, music, dog, wife, etc. Will this book help some? Sure, it is a nice reference. Will it teach you enough to say you know analysis. No."
4,"A bit of a mess, but the results were good","Applying the silver coating is more difficult than it appeared to be, but the frames actually turned out really well. The clean up is not too bad, but it's not a project for for folks who are not handy."
1,Waste,"Do not waste your money. Other than the magnetic glow plug tool, it is useless with CHEAP quality items."
3,Great Buildup Only To Fizzle Out at The End,"As a first time reader of Nancy Pickard, I didn't know what to expect. I can tell you, I was very impressed with the opening of the book and the way that the author had written a book within a book to tell us the story of the killer. Ms. Pickard is very talented and pulls you into the story with ease. But what kept this from being a great book was the lazy and abrupt way the book is concluded. Several improbable plot twists, including a right place at the right time shooting, caused me to have a dissatisfied feeling when I finished the book. It seemed like the author, after building up our expectations with a very fine beginning, just wanted the novel to end as quickly as possible without any imaginative twists that characterized the first half of the novel. I will read Ms. Pickard again, but I hope she spends a little more time in crafting an ending that lives up to the promise and suspense the beginning of her novel creates."
5,Excellent......,"A real winner. Expertly written. Ms. Pickard handled a difficult subject very well. Strong, likeable characters."
4,The Best Yet,"Ms. Pickard is an excellent storyteller. I have enjoyed all of her Jenny Cain mysteries. This story, however, tops anything she's ever written. A very involving plot with plenty of suspense and believable characters combine to draw the reader along at a rapid pace. A thoroughly enjoyable read."
2,Didn't live up to its promise,"I really agree with an earlier reviewer who said the ending was disappointing. The author drew me in, got me involved in the whole, mixed up, sad story of Ray Raintree and his family, and then, suddenly, it was over. It ended so abruptly, I felt cheated and disappointed.The book is also poorly edited. Besides the ever-present extraneous commas, there are a few startling errors, both on the content side and the grammar / punctuation side."
3,Sometimes it's hard to find the whole truth,"A crime story writer sets out to write about the murder of a little girl and the the horrid creature who killed her. The murderer, a young, odd looking man named Ray Raintree seems to be a man without a past. No records anywhere, no DNA, no fingerprints, nothing is found until the writer, Marie Lightfoot, discovers one inescapable fact that explains even if it doesn't exonerate the killer. I've enjoyed other more recent books by Pickard, among them The Virgin of Small Plains which I think is her best so far. Eunice Boeve, author of Ride a Shadowed Trail"
2,Yawn.,"Ms. Pickard doesn't have much literary style in this monotone, monochromatic book. I felt like it was written by a tenth grade student with no talent for writing. The characterizations were shallow and weak, the so-called romance seemed like a thrown in throw away and none of the book engendered any strong feelings, not in the characters, not in the plot and the rather forced and abrupt ending. A fast read, short and not very sweet.....thumbs down for this totally mediocre effort."
5,melts 'em away!,"This stuff is fantastic. it literally turns dry callouses into a gel which can be gently scrubbed away, leaving your feet baby soft! I can't recommend it highly enough. Be sure not to leave it on too long, as it IS quite strong. It works better if you soak your feet in warm water before applying. Great for dry, neglected winter feet."
1,It works but it's dangerous.,"I applied this medication exactly as directed, you can feel it working almost immediately but when you wipe it off you find the skin below the callous is burnt away. Very ugly and very painful. I will not use this method ever again. It's been two days and I'm still changing the bloody dressings."

1,What was he thinking?,"The author of this book, Dr. Edgar Berman had a most incredible career. He was evidently a talented and amazing man. But this book...wow. I don't know what to say. It is a jumbled, incoherent mess. You will finish the book and not have taken anything away from it except that the author seems angry about many things.Not knowing anything about Dr. Berman, when I began the book, I noticed that he seemed to be especially angry - even hostile - toward women. Throughout the text, he referred to them by such names as Old Maid, Hen, Flabby militant feminist, and platform-shod gum chewing floozy. He wrote that Gynecology and/or Obstetrics would be an ideal specialty except for one thing - women. Chapter 10, on plastic surgery, is titled ""From Hags to Bitches"". A little research on the good Doctor revealed a long history of disrespect for women.What else is there to be said? This book is going in the trash."
4,"Good, but end was lacking",This second half of Trigun was good but unlike the first half which was extremely funny and light hearted. The second half was so very heart wrecking having to watch Vash break down and cry bitterly through out all of the deaths of various characters. Being so depressing with little comedy to break up the mood it makes it a hard series to watch over and over.
3,OK,Well I can see why so many people like this show but i didnt like it at all I thought it wa going to be lots of shoot outs and blood and killing well i know some people dont like that but that why i got the DVD and it wasnt anything i thought it was goin to be like theres hardly any shoot outs or killing but vash made me crack up alot its more of a comedy then and action
1,Just as bad as the first!,The first one sucked and so does this one. This is the last time I ever buy any anime based on the cover. Such a cool character with such a terrible story line. This series will only go down. This is a rental kind of movie not one you should ever buy.
4,Vash knows something.,"The show now begins to develop something of a plot (*lacking in series 1) and the episodes this time around are better constructed, We get a small glimpse of something of Vash's mysterious past, and start to get the sense that he knows something, actually a lot of something. Not to mention, just HOW old is he anyway?"
4,Trigun: Lost Past Dub,"Trigun, vol. 2: Lost Past, though dubbed, was still an excellent title. The dubbing, while it can't compare to the dubbing of Princess Mononoke, was decently performed. In this volume, a bit more of Vash's past is revealed, though not enough to actually understand. He's also still being followed by those two insurance agents. It seems like there could be a possible relationship in store for Vash and a very jealous insurance woman. This volume contains a very large enemy for Vash to face, as well as a ride on a huge train gone bad... This volume is also filled with ""Love and peace!""."
5,An enjoyable read!,"I thoroughly enjoyed this collection of essays by a variety of authors, as it gives different views of Dylan and is at times very funny. This book covers some great topics and tells some fantastic stories of Dylan not previously covered in other books. Not only does this book span Dylan's career, but also the 20 years of ISIS. Derek Barker has lovingly put this collection together and it is an enjoyable read for any Dylan fan."
3,Not as good as the older version,"I have been using these sticks for many years and they do a great job of helping to keep your face from getting razor burn from daily shaving. Really fantastic, but......Remington decided to ""improve"" the scent. I was revolted when I tried the new ones with the white/red/blue cap. The increase of 'parfum' is too much and just stinks - imho. What used to be a pleasant experience first thing in the morning has turned into a trial. I keep thinking I'll get used to it but I never have. Hmmm.....maybe noseplugs.I would not recommend buying these in bulk, (as I used to do) until you've tried one to see if you can handle the smell.Since I first reviewed this product back in March, I finally found one without the intense smell. It's called Derma Bloc Pre Shave Powder Stick. It's also sold by a great company - Shavetronics, which you can order thru Amazon.It's great! - and no more noseplugs."
4,Powder,Great stuff that my husband uses daily. I already rated this product but we are very pleased to have it available.
5,A Great electric pre-shave,I use Face saver with every shave and it works great. Use it dry before showering and you won't have any 'burn' or rash.
5,Remington SP-5 FaceSaver Pre-Shave Powder Stick,"This is a great product, have been using it for years. Tried other dry methods and they do not work nearly as well as this product."
5,FaceSaver Powderstick,"I have used FaceSaver Powderstick for shaving for many, many years. It sets up my face for the electric shaver and for very pleasant electric shaving. Not able to find it locally, I appreciate finding it at Amazon.com."
1,Not as advertised,"This description states it is a package of 6. However, when received there is only 1 item in the packaging. This is false advertising!"
1,(Pack of 6),"I order 1: ""Remington SP-5 Pre-Shave Talc Stick Face saver for all Men's Shavers (pack of 6)"". From the title it stats ""(Pack of 6)"". When I got in my order in the mail I received 1 stick not 6. If you are sealing 1 sick and not a pack of 6 the title should eliminate ""(pack of 6)"" since it is contradicting to what the customer gets!"
1,"Way too perfumey, gets all over the place","This is a paraffin based product that basically spreads powder over your face. It does help with dry shaving, and lasts a long time.It also REEKS. If you do not like perfumes and colognes like me, do not get this. I hate the smell. I've used it many times and every time I do the smell stays with me half the day. YUCK. Why they are adding perfume to this product?Furthermore, it behaves a lot like talcum powder, which means you end up with powder all over your shirt or counter after using, and it isn't especially easy to clean out of an electric razor. Since it's basically paraffin powder, it doesn't rinse out easily, you pretty much have to thoroughly brush out your razor periodically."
2,Messy,This thing is messy and does not seem to improve shaving comfort and clugs both cutters and screen. Waste of money as far as I concerned.
4,We should all be lucky enough to have such colorful friends.,Other reviewers have said it is all about the writing which in their opinion takes away from the story. I feel if the writing is not lyrical and moving there is no story to read. To me there is nothing like a book in which you feel you have to jot down some of the sentences in your own journal as they are so beautiful and moving. So I enjoyed this book completely.
3,Fails to deliver,"After an explosive opening and a gathering of momentum in supbsequent early chapters, this book fails to deliver on its early promise. It gets bogged down in the ""all woman are strong and supportive of each other"" syndrome - despite the fact that the whole chain of events is triggered by another woman sleeping with the protagonist's husband in the first chapter. The sexuality issues that are raised are distracting and unnecessary. The language is clumsy in places, and text such as ""Wow, Jane. Wow"" really become tedious. The main problem though is the plot - utterly contrived and all too neatly packaged. After all, most (all?) women know that the kind of misery that our mothers and teenage daughters can inflict on us cannot be resolved as simply and utterly as it is in this book."
1,And Everyone Lived Happily Ever After....,"What I first accepted as gradual spiritual awakening became, after a few chapters, somewhat cloying. By the end, it had moved firmly into a fairy tale, while still trying to be literature. My, my, what a perfect self-actualizing world is out there--just beyond our fingertips."
4,I liked it,I liked the book because I thought there were some great ideas for women. One of them was the shower the girls gave the main character. A lot of the personalities I could see in my group of friends and so that helped me connect. I wish the book could have went deeper though... deeper into the daughter and all characters awakenings.
3,I don't know...,I almost feel like you have to have a giant chip on your shoulder and hate men to fully enjoy this book. I found that this novel was rather tinged with feminist agenda and is based on the theory that all women are headstrong survivors who don't need anything other than their own determination to survive. This book was so descriptive that there were times when I thought I would fall asleep. Even in the opening chapter there is an awful lot of feet and pink nail polish taking up the pages. I suppose I should have known then that it would not exactly be my cup of tea.I will give this book credit for making sense and not jumping around too much. I didn't dislike the entire book. There was some good internal dialogue and parts of this book are very creatively written and sometimes even funny. I just didn't think this book lived up to the potential it had.
4,Miracles for Marlee,"A beautiful, heart-rendering story of a family's love and desire to bring a daughter into their life. The family's dedication to overcome medical and financial obstcales to achieve their dream of adopting a Chinese orphan is a remarkable journey.Shannon Turner is united with an angel, Three year old Marlee. Marlee is a delightful girl whose precious love and devotion for Chloe, a fellow orphan being adopted by another family, will indelibly impress the reader with the emotions these girls feel.Experience the love of this family."
5,Genuinely Tugs At Your Heart,This is truly a heartwarming story of bringing hearts and destinies together through perseverance and dedication. The story of Marlee's adoption should be an encouragement for others seeking similar adoptions.
5,Finally...vintage Megatron (or at least close),"After all the years of seeing Megatron as everything from a tank to a dinosaur, it's good to finally see the Decepticon leader as a gun again like he should be, even if it's not the original gun version. The design is very well done in his gun and robot form and is reminiscent of classic G-1 look from the original cartoon series, especially with him having the cannon on his arm like the original. I'd even go so far as to say I like this Megatron figure better than the original one that came out in the 80s, which looked hideous in robot form unlike the cartoon.This figure was slightly difficult to transform the first time around but it quickly got easier to do so, and I do wish his head was just a little bit bigger, but all in all this is a good purchase and a must have if you're a transformer collector."
4,A good Megatron but you can do better.,"First off let me say that this is a good toy. He has two solid modes and is a worthy representation to the G1 leader. That being said, I have some information for you. There is, on this very website, a megatron that costs less and gives you so much more! Takara classics megatron. He has the proper color scheme and light piping without those stupid orange pieces that are needed on toy guns. The real issue is that Takara's version now costs LESS THAN this one making it a clearly better buy!!!!! So go look up Takara classics Megatron and buy him before you get this lesser version."
4,Good but.,"The blaster mode is alright,the robot mode is great but for one thing...the green wings are just stupid looking, I dub it Megatron ""The Gay gun"" for that reason alone,of coarse IMO yellow or orange would be worse ...some of the color schemes they have been having lately are just stupid looking simply dark color themes that are pleasing to the eyes would go lot longer that the rainbow frill they been tossing on some of the figures, don;t get me wrong the purple is a perfect match megaton,it would have worked even if I never fallen in love with beast wars.I plan on painting the wings black or white or purple maybe a off white purple might be to much for it..."
1,Is it a blanket?,"I got this stuff just now. Well, how can I say?I never know this kind of thing can be called ""blanket"". It is sparse, and thin, looks so cheap.I am thinking about donating it... Unfortunately, I bought 3..."
3,"Nice, soft and warm, but really MESSY","Let me first say that I recieved this blanket for free with the order of some sheets. It is incredibly soft, and I do use it as a summer blanket. However, little white pieces of it are all over my carpeting and bed. It sheds worse then my Golden Retriever (and he sheds alot). I have to vacuum my bedroom every single day. As a gift with purchase, it is fine...and it IS INCREDIBLY soft, but it is very messy...especially when you use it with Jersey type sheets."
1,do not wash this product,"I bought this in Sage, for around $24, it was soft and it was cozy. I washed it once and it started to disintegrate. Now it's in my trunk as an an emergency/beach blanket. Not recommended."
1,Would of been nice....,"Sure could of wrapped up in this, had my order been shipped to me, kept the certificate and the products..."
1,Item never delivered,I bought this as a promotional product along with Wamsutta 100% Egyptian Cotton Jersey King Sheet Set. They never delivered Thermal King Blanket and canceled it without any refund for this promotion. A typical bait-and-switch.
1,This blanket isn't even worth getting it for free!!,"I ordered this blanket because it came free with a set of sheets. I immediately opened the bag that it came in and then drove to my local Salvation Army donation station and donated it to them. This blanket is extremely cheap, it looks like they placed plastic on the ends of it, and it itches! Even if you get this blanket for free, don't bother taking it, or if you do, then donate it to people who actually need it."
1,Cheapest Blanket Ever,"It feels nice and soft, but this blanket started turning to fuzz from the day I started using it. Leaves lint and fuzz EVERYWHERE... I donated mine to charity a few weeks ago and am still finding the same little fuzz around the house and on my clothes to this day"
2,Dont wash,These are nice use&throw type blankets. Originally I purchased it for occassional guests. Now I can not after a single wash. Really bad quality! [...]
1,Close to Garbage!,"I got them free with purchase of Wamsutta sheets. These blankets are of really cheap quality. Thin, mesh-like texture. Threads get loose at the ends. Leaving traces of fabric everywhere. I got rid of it cause I am afraid the loose ends and fabric may be swallowed by babies."
5,A Must Read!!!,"If you have read the first two books of this series you must read this read this one!!! This is a great follow up to Dark Fire and Night Watch. Haunted Souls just sucks you into the story and into the climatic conclusion of the series. All the players are assembled for the final battle of good versus evil in the small town of Pine Forest, the most haunted town in the world. Will true love triumph over true evil read this one to find out."
2,Maynard live in Prague,This is a real disapointment. The band is terrible behind Maynard and he doesn't even sound that great. He was in his prime during this time period but this DVD doesn't show it. The clarinetist is not that great and he is even more annoying to watch. I don't recommend this DVD.

3,Don't expect this to sound like Rammstein!,"I got this CD out of recommendations from Rammstein fans. In my opinion, the first 4 songs are the best on the album. It sort of slants down from there. The voice of the lead singer, Alexx, is definitely similar to Till Lindemann, but the songs themselves are far from Rammstein material! Their 2nd, 3rd, and newest albums are considerably better than this one. It's not their best work, but it itself has good qualities. They have a rap-metal orientation on this which is not that discernable on the others. In my mind, ""Schlag Zurück"" is the best song on here! However, if you want to sample Megaherz for only their best works, then I'd recommend Kopfschuss and Herzwerk II."
1,They're no good at all!!!,"I think that Megaherz is far behind Rammstein in both lyrics and music. For an example, Gott sein is the worsest song i've ever heard. It doesn't have a good lyrical content and they sing like ""Die Aertze"", which is a band that I laugh at. It's no joke, Rammstein is the greatest band in the world, then Blind Guardian!!"
2,not all german music is rammstein,"First off, I am not ""bashing"" Megaherz in this review- their music is good. I own all of their released albums. By far, their best is ""kopfschuss"", and I recommend you purchase it first. There style is consistent, but the intensity changes from album to album. Many reviews I have read regarding Megaherz relate them to Rammstein- which hurts my feelings. Just because the lyrics are in german does not mean these two bands have anything else in common. That would be like comparing STP to Ministry. Rammstein is heavily immersed in mixage and electronica, while Megaherz is more your traditional 4-piece rock band. they have a mellower sound, and lighter lyrics (rammstein has some truly evil themes). If you like german hardcore, I recommend a band called ""Schweisser"". as a devout rammstein fan, i find this a little more to my liking than Megaherz."
5,Just plain WOW!,"This is my first review, which this Megaherz CD has inspired me to write. When I first heard of this German band, I thought they were some kind of industrial/metal band, but I decided to purchase the CDs anyway. Well, when I received them I was more than pleasantly surprised; song after song had me. I was rocking along with every single one. I'd say they are close to Rammstein's kind of Musik, but not the same style. Rammstein is more industrial/metal while Megaherz is more techno/metal (more metal than techno). I really enjoy their music and will recommend, you the reader, to purchase all of their CDs. I will be buying more in the future and I will be letting all my friends know about this band. They rock! They rocked me! They WILL rock you! I wish I could give 6 stars for this CD."
4,Log Hotel,"Charming story of a log decomposing in the forest and the host of animals living in the log. Demonstrates simply how everything in nature is connected. Beautifully illustarted with enough lizards, bugs and other critters to keep everyone interested."
1,Worse than Terrible,"This is poorly made, has sharp edges, and it's not even worth a one- star rating. The biggest disappointment I've ever encountered."
1,only looks good,"This is the worst cage I have ever bought, I wish I could give it a zero. It's only appropriate for small mice or dwarf and robovski hamsters. My syrian got stuck in the opening of the little house, panicked and and almost hurt himself. The ramps are too short and give way when he steps on them. Since the openings are positioned above each other, he fell from the very top to the very bottom. The exercise wheel is too small and, because the sides are curved, no other bigger wheels will fit. The feeding trays are tiny and the water is difficult to get at. This cage looks well designed but it's not. I'm so mad!"
1,Not a good purchase,"I bought this cage at my local pet store for my first Syrian hamster. The other reviewers are right. Do NOT purchase for a Syrian. The cage is too small. I immediately took out the house and put in a natural one at the bottom. The food containers are too small and hard to get in and out so I bought a ceramic bowl. I also bought a better water bottle. The wheel is too small and the raised areas to make it easier to run on are sharp. The ramps are too steep. We had to drill holes for the second level's ramp so hammie could get a good grip. The plastic removable level tabs are small and could easily snap off if you try to take the level out to clean (I don't know I just clean with a sponge inside). You cannot put a bigger wheel in unless you are extremely creative. We managed to get a bigger 8 1/2 wheel in there but seriously, buy a bigger, non-round cage. This one is awful. We will be upgrading when we have a bit more money."
3,Doesn't smell as pleasnat as I thought,"It does not smell as pleasant as I thought. Also, it came with free pumps. But they had leaked in the package. Then one came open & spilled teh whole bottle of shampoo in the trunk of my car."
5,"Great for dry, frizzie or gray hair!",A friend of mine let me try her Joico conditioner and I loved it and wanted to find the biggest bottle I could find.It makes your hair instantly softer and tangle free. It keeps your hair soft and smells great.
1,Not what I expected,Got 7 CN Tower charms for a ladies group. The quality of the silver charms is not what I expected. They seem rather inferior in quality. No time to make a return on the product so just have to live with my purchase.
4,Perfect DVD,The DVD was in perfect condition and arrived right on time! I bought this for my sister and she loves it! Thanks!
4,"Cults, Cults, and More Cults","Ron Rhodes has written a succesful primer on the topic of non-Christian cults. The book is very easy to understand, matched with colorful photos and a reader friendly format. Johnson (another reviewer) is correct when he says Rhodes misses some information, however, I think in this case, it is a stregnth of Rhodes' book.Rhodes accuractly portrays the major teachings of churchs like the 'The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints'(Mormons), Jehovah Witnesses, and Unity School of Christianty, just to name a few. He also deals with other religions and their teachings, but here he is a little less effective.This text is written for the 'layman' and as such, it succeeds for those individuals who have not read any information about these unquie religions but need some basic information. For those of us who have studied many of these sects in-depth, the book is quite boring and one would be better off purchasing something with more theological depth."
5,The Challenge of the Cults (and New Religions),"This like most of Ron Rhodes book was an excellent book. It selects a few of the organizations that people attempt to pass off as religions and exposes them as cults. It gives the history and the doctrines that these organizations originated from and believe and then Rhodes who seems to be an expert in this area exposes them and not only does he expose them, he backs his exposition up with scripture. This is a must read and will help you to confront the deception of false Christs and lying doctrines with clear and well-grounded truth of biblical Christianity."
3,Good Read..,This was a good read but read slowly as some parts are wordy. Mormonism was covered VERY WELL. 1/4 of this book was really dry.
3,A good read..,but read slowly as some parts are wordy. Morminism was covered VERY WELL. 1/4 of this book was really dry.
1,Some Integrity Please,My objection to this type of book is does nothing but create divides. For example he lists one religion as a cult that currently is the fourth leading religion in the United States. The pace it is setting it will be a world religion within a 100 years. Not bad for a cult. Just to set the record straight the dictionary defines a cult as a 1.System of religious worship and ritual.2.Devoted attachment to a person or principle3. a sect.Under that definition every organized religion is a cult. That would include Evangelical Christians as they espouse Bible and Being Saved.
3,Not as good as I thought it would be.,"This Manga can be included as ""Slash"" due to the fact it has the main star, a young man, pretending to be a prostitute and is picked up by another man. A very SHORT and sweet section.There's not much of a story or anything that really got me interested. The art is different from the cover, which is disappointing. The cover is another reason why I bought it, it's pretty. Though nothing really happens that can be included as BL, Shonen Ai or Yaoi except that one scene mentioned before so just note that Yaoi Fans.Also there are a lot of female characters for those of you who wanted to oogle bishonen, so don't expect it heaps of gorgeous guys cos there ain't.So this is a Manga for a Shoujo fan interested in Boys staring in them.I doubt I'll be collecting the series."
2,Low quality visuals and extreme difficulty will make you toss this,"The Good: Sharper graphics, and audio, FMV movie sequencesThe Bad: Movie quality is so low that it hurts your eyes, same old action we've seen before, extremely hardI never really liked Sega CD because it was more like an HD upgrade to the original Genesis versions. The Terminator is no exception. While the game has movie sequences (which have disgustingly horrific quality), and sharper graphics and sound it doesn't make the game any more special.The game is just like any other side scrolling 2D action game but with a movie license. Don't get me wrong this game does a good job at that but we've seen it all before. I, in particular, didn't care for the game and didn't even finish the first level before putting it down. If you're craving some 2D action games then The Terminator is for you."
5,A great game for Sega CD,Yup Terminator was great fast paced arcade action and the music OMG it's great too Tommy Tallarico is a great musican for games 10 levels 9 10 are really challenging hard but fun. There's a few cheats for it but but levels 9 & 10 still are hard be because you got to time your jumps it has FMV between each level so if you are the 1 % of people who haven't seen the movie it tells the story this game should're got more attention in 1993 than Double Switch Ground Zero Texas Night Trap and all those other retarded FMV games by Digital Pictures.
5,Maxine Yelling It Like It Is,This was a gift for someone who loves Maxine. She was elated! Anyone who loves Maxine will love this book!!
2,No new information,"As the spouse of a cancer patient, and admittedly more pragmatic than ""new age"" I was dissapointed that this book doesn't add anything new to the Iscador information available from the major cancer sites on the web. It is mostly a rehash of older information with some notes on other alternative therapy and diet. It only gives very brief mention of the one significant english language study report that supports the use of Iscador. (Also available on the web)If it is your only source of information then it is a start, if you have done any of your own research, don't bother."
4,Nice glossy appearance,This paper is really nice and thick. My only complaint (and this may have more to do with my printer than the paper) is that it gets slightly dull after running through the laser printer.
1,Beware! NOT for all HP color laser printers,"Most of the packaging leads one to believe this paper of good for all HP color laser printers. It is not. I have the Laserjet 1500 and bought this paper without seeing the fine print on the back. The first print was horribly smeared. The toner came off on my printer's rollers causing a time-consuming mess to clean--and maybe permanent damage. Later I saw the fine print that says the paper is not recommended for my particular HP Color Laserjet model. By the way, the so-called ""glossy"" paper is not glossy in any traditional sense of the word. Unsatisfactory all around."
4,Elizabeth Lowell Fidler and Fiora,"This was a good book and an exciting read. I have read the entire series, even though it was written a while ago."
5,Best resource of its kind,"I have used this book continually since its first or second (looseleaf) edition. Ben Wright wrote one of the first serious works to diligently and thoughtfully explain practical Internet legal issues. He and Jane Winn have continued to make this the best, clearest reference work on e-commerce, a field where many poorly-written books were rushed to press. I keep it at my desk and tell my e-commerce lawyer colleagues to do the same."
5,Panasonic 1.2 Microwave Stainless Steel,We just got this Panasonic Microwave and it is very easy to use and very well made. The display is very easy to use.
3,"Sensible, useful, but unexciting","An eminently sensible book in which it's hard to find much with which to disagree. If you haven't thought much about the thinking process and don't have a background in cognitive psychology, this book is well worth reading. If you have, then you'll find it agreeable but not enlightening, though it may remind you of important points that you've forgotten to pay attention to. Wells focuses on flexible thinking and how to ask the right questions. He outlines the strategic thinking cycle: Perceiving, acquiring insight, developing foresight, understanding possibilities, identifying strategic levers, matching levers with capabilities, reasoning, choosing a core strategy, and making the strategy work."
5,A great beginner's source for TSO.,Doug Lowe does a great job with this easy to read text on MVS / TSO. Get this book if you need to jump right into MVS. Plenty of examples and real world analogies make this book a must have for your reference library.
4,Great TSO and ISPF primer!,I was an assistant manager on a help desk providing support for a Z/OS mainframe running TSO. This book was invaluable for training new hires on the basics of the system. I highly recommended for anyone taking the dive into these waters.
4,Great for Beginners to MVS,This book is great to introduce beginners to MVS and is a handy reference when working in MVS. I give it 4 stars because it has not been updated since the 90's and the introduction uses examples that are very dated. Otherwise it would get 5 stars.
5,Just what I ordered,"Perfect just what I ordered and very reasonable even with shipping. All I could find in the stores was high end cusinart for $50, did not want that. Working great. Don't know how would carve a turkey or slice flank steak without one"
1,Don't bother with this cheap knife,"Having had a Cuisinart electric knife before this, I decided to go for a lower priced knife. ""What difference could it make""?The answer is a lot! I bake all my own bread. After trying it on two loaves, I put it in the charity donation box and bought another Cuisinart. Clearly did not save any money but I'm happy again. This knife would not go easily through a hard crust loaf. On another loaf, it cut unevenly and vibrated excessively. It was not made for ease of operation. Felt clumsy in my hand and the on/off thumb switch was difficult to keep activitated."
2,WELL,"Price was a factor in buying, but I wanted mostly for slicing bread machine bread. The bit at the end of the blades get hung up in my Presto slicing guide as the blades are too short; further, the switch is extremely temperamental and only works if you move your thumb around a lot. I'd return it, if the postage, packaging and trip to post office were worth it + trying to dig up original cash receipt! These people do NOT want return business! (They've been bought by Salton, so they use this brand for junk)"
2,In carving my Thanksgiving Turkey it cut jagged slices,"My old carving knife looked fairly similar, but cut like a charm. This new knife is not near as clean with the cuts..."
2,Electric Knife,Knife is kinda flimsy. Blade is definitely flimsy. Handle makes it awkward to hold when cutting things. Just not completely satisfied with this.
5,Great for the kitchen.,"THIS IS SUCH A GREAT PRODUCT. THIS ELECTRIC KNIFE CUTS THROUGH HAM, ROAST BEEF, AND HOME MADE BREAD WITH EASE. I LOVE THE WAY IT IS MADE WITH THE HANDLE. IT IS VERY LIGHT WEIGHT AND EASY TO HANDLE."
5,EXCELLENT,"This was a very clearly written and insightful book. It was well researched and presented in an appealing format in layman's terms. He described the essence of flavors,perfumes, and other good chemicals. The best book on the importance of chemistry in everyday life that I've read."
5,the master in action,Thank you steve for making this available to us :)my favourite are the yes demosreally cool insights
3,Neat But Expensive!,"This clock's main selling point was the fact that you never have to set it, that it receives radio signals from the US Atomic clock in Colorado. What they don't mention is that for the clock to receive the signal it has to have an unobstructed view (line of sight) to Colorado. I.E. here in NY I HAVE TO HANG THE CLOCK SO IT FACES A WINDOW with a Westward view, then once a day the clock automatically searches for the radio signal to update itself.Unfortunately I don't have a Westward facing window in the room with my clock, so what usually happens is that once a week or so I take the clock to a room with a West window and press the button on the back of the clock to start a search for the radio time signal. I leave it in the window for a half-hour or so and, Ta-Da! the clock has updated itself.The clock also displays the current Day and Date as well as the ambient air temperature around the clock, all very nice features."
2,"Nice, but......","I think this clock is great! It's easy to read, I love the date/day feature, and the temp. feature is a great asset. The clock is compact and hangs on the wall quite nicely.I'm pleased with everything about it except (you knew there was a ""but"" coming, right?)....the ""radio controlled"" feature. I'm in SC - a LONG way from Colorado. No matter what I do, I can't pick up a radio signal. I've manually set the clock (easy using the directions provided), but the clock is SUPPOSED to set itself. So, if you don't live within a couple of states of Colorado, don't expect the ""Atomic Radio Controlled Clock"" to reach reception. Nice clock, but too expensive.I'm not returning it. I love the style & features. I'll just continue to adjust it manually. But I wish the ding-dang antenna icon would GO AWAY after so many missed attempts at radio reception!"
5,Best Drill and Technique Book I have read yet.,This book is THE greatest technique and drill book that I have yet to read. I have learned so much from it and I use it when I practice every day at my house. This book is for any person dedicated to making their game better and I recommend it for anyone that wants to play to their full potential.
4,I'll Take the High Road: an education in flying,"I first read this book as a teenager shortly after its publication in 1939. It reinforced my interest in aviation. After 70 years and 3000 hours as a private pilot/airplane owner I read it again. My interest in aviation continues. I consider this book and its companion book ""Stick and Rudder"" also by Langewiesche to be fundamental reading for those who have an interest in flying small aircraft.It is written in an easily read conversational style that takes the reader along with the author as he fulfills his desire for flight.He tells of travels in small airplanes and imparts the wisdom learned from each of his experiences. At times he seems willing to accept challenges a bit more aggressive than than I would.CS"
5,So Cool!,This doll is so pretty!She has such beautiful golden hair.And sparkly eyes.The color she is wearing is pretty!But her outfit is a little too flashy.I like this doll alot!!!I rated her educational value to 2 cause she teaches you how not to dress at someones B-Day.Please do not dress like this doll!
3,A warm rememberence of a magical place,"This book would be a welcome trip down memory lane for anyone who knew and loved Palisades Amusement Park and the simpler times the park thrived in. A plainly written, honest account by a man whose life was indelibly imprinted by this magical place; the book contains loads of small black and white photos, many of which look like copies from newspapers, but most are fairly poor reproductions. The two lonely pages of color photos left me longing for more.If you grew up in Northern New Jersey with fond memories of your times at the park; then by all means you will enjoy looking back through the pages of this book."
1,Disappointed,"This book dealt more with way before my time, more with the beginning times. I would have liked more from the 50's on. Returned the book."
5,What a moving story!,"This is definately a coming-of-age tale. Young Esther has to grow up fast, and she does so, admirably. Going from privelidge only child to all but independent bread winner for her family, she shows the hardships faced by those in labor camps and general exile at the time.Only thing lacking? I wanted to know more at the end of the tale. Her family reunited (minus some members) I'd have loved to have an epilogue about their 'after exile' settlement back in Poland/Lithuania.Still, I highly recommend The Endless Steppe."
5,An Important Perspective,"The Endless Steppe is written for the 9 and up age range, which makes me like it all the more, since kids are often given very few types of perspective on any given event. It flows easily, though I wish the passage of time had been more explicitly stated throughout the book. The writing is good and doesn't *feel* like a children's book, and the content doesn't either really, since it's obviously going to focus on her childhood feelings and experiences as she was a child at the time.That, to me, is the mark of a good children's book. Some authors talk down to children, some talk to them. This feels perfectly suitable for children, rather than feeling like a children's book."
4,A good book,"The book is about a wealthy Polish family who is sent to Siberia because of their liberal thoughts. They were taken from their home in Poland and sent to a labor camp in the steppe region of Siberia. The youngest in the family is Esther, a young girl who is the narrator and author of this true story. The setting is Poland but quickly moves to the snowy, brutal steppe. The book tells of the terrible conditions of the family's imprisonment.This book is both suspenseful and reflective. The family goes through many hard times such as poverty and starvation and I wanted to keep reading to find out what happened next. Esther had a hard life but she survived to write about it. This book teaches the reader about what happened to all the persecuted families in eastern Europe."
3,The Endless Steppe,"The Endless Steppe was written by Esther Hautzig in 1968. She wrote about her experiences as a child in Siberia. It is an amazing story of perseverance and courage, from being pulled away from her beautiful house in Vilna to living in a Siberian mine with her family. The events that happen in the book seem fictional and unreal, and the fact that it really happened makes the book more interesting to read. In 1968, the year that the book was written, The Endless Steppe won the Honor Book Award from the Children's Spring Festival. It is an easy to read book and is full of amazing adventures. I would give the book 9 out of 10 for interesting stories and a first-hand experience of life as a Jew in the 1940's. Even if the holocaust is not of interest, it is still interesting to learn about her struggles and accomplishments in Siberia. I would recommend this book to anyone above nine years old."
2,Good Narrative but Poorly written,"The Endless Steppe is a good narrative book. The author did a good job trying to bring the reader into the story. If your looking for a leisure story of a girl in Siberia, you've found it. I can think of a hundred books that are better. For what it is worth, a children's novel (by the way my little sister loved it), it is pretty good. But when it comes down to it, it is just not well-written and a tad drab. By the way, what's so bad about communism? How are we to sympathize with a spoiled brat? Power to the people, workers, and laborers! !"
5,"For 26 years, this story has lived with me.","I was 12 years old when I read this book in Kingston Jamaica as part of my 8th grade English Literature Programme. It was my first introduction to the inhumanities human beings inflict upon each other. I have read Esther Hautzig's story at least 25 times over the years and each time I read it, my heart and soul is filled with compassion, fear, tears, joy, courage, and a whole gamet of emotions. Her ability to describe the events of her and her family's exile to Siberia in such explicit detail is one of the most incredible attributes I could bestow upon her. I believe that the greatest crime one can commit is a crime of the spirit, and Esther Rudomin, in spite of her ordeal, managed to find a way to hold on to her zest for life. Her spirit just completely explodes in every page, every word of her book. She lives within my heart, and her courage to live has been a guiding force in my life since I was 12 years old. I am now 38."
3,WWII from a different perspective&#65533;,"It's during 1942 when little Esther Rudomin's life changes forever. A resident of Poland, who lived a comfortable life with her parents and extended family, Esther, along with her father, mother and grandparents are arrested by the Russians, suspected of being ""capitalists"" and ripped from their home. They are piled into cattle cars, their destination unknown. When the train finally stops, they realize they are in the harsh region of Siberia. For the next long five years, Esther recounts the struggles her family go through for food, clothing and shelter. We also see how Esther tries to fit in as a young teenager in the Siberian society. I found the book opened my eyes to an event I knew nothing about, while at the same time revealing to me the Siberian way of life during WWII."
1,smoked my pc,"I was nervous to order this due to the low price, and lack of reviews, you know the old adage you get what you pay for. In the end my cheapness won out and I ordered two. I installed the first in a remote PC and after a little fiddling it worked great. Encouraged by the great results with the first I installed the second in a different but identical remote PC and got it working but the connection was really slow. When I tried to shut down the PC I got a popup that there was a problem with the adapter, then it shut down. I restarted the PC and it seemed fine and pressed for time I left. The next morning the PC would not start and turns out the motherboard was toast."
2,Did not enjoy. Did not finish.,"The discomfort of this book has nothing to do with blackand white. Rather it is the homophobia that reignsthroughout...at least, all that I read. There is never anylet up in stories of a homophobic society and theinternalized homophobia it yeilds."
1,Do not buy,"After installing game, the screen was upside down. Could not play game. No instruction booklet and readme very confusing. Finally got game to work by looking at screen upside down and putting in different mode. Starting playing game and my pc rebooted. Must have disk in drive to play and it must be disk 2. This game is crap."
3,Missions are quite boring,"Although the grafics are very good, I find that all missions form either side, allies or Japan are very boring. In that repeated attacks on Iwo and Wake eg; are repeated over and over. The ""skip"" feature doesn't work, making base to objective last too long. Hidden targets are a bummer. I see or feel no difference in flying the Wildcat and the Hellcat; Hellcat having 2000HP vs Wildcat's 1200 hp. Carrier landings are the best feature of the game. My playing time of this game will not be very long."
5,C1 makes another great WW2 game,"this is a great ww2 flight sim. the cockpits and models for just amazing..along with the flight models and damage models as well. it runs pretty well on a computer that is a year or two old as long as you don't max the Gfx up.for those new to the C1:maddox flight sims this is pretty real, some people new to flights sim have trouble, but it you go to the website and get on the fourms there are tons of people who would love help..even fly on-line with you and coach you!one last thing if you get this make sure you also get IL2:forgetten battles gold pack(with aces add-on) that will give you also 200 flyable planes!! plus tons and tons more AI-only planes...it really is amazing how many and how well the planes are done up in this game!"
2,Disappointed,"""I wonder if the combination of a russian developer, and a french distributor will ever make for good gameplay in a simulator focused on a singularly american theater.""Amen brother. No TBD no SB2C no B6N no D4Y no B5N (to fly) no TBF (to fly) (which dropped more bombs then any other type over Pacific) and that is supposed to be carrier warfare? P-39s in Marine Squadrons, why not F-16s???? Where are the B-26, the G3M, the Ventura, the Beaufort, the Ki-44?????? Arghhh they had a golden opportunity and they blew it."
3,Difficult,"The graphics of this game are pretty good, but I found it difficult to fly the aircraft. Not sure what the problem is, but it might be on my end. Overall, the game is pretty accurate depicting the WWII fighters and its awesome to get a gun kill on a ZERO! Having to trim the aileron becomes aggrevating while in a dogfight, but like I said, maybe my X52 needs to be configured for this game. I'd buy it again for sure."
3,what?! no good planes!?,"let me get stright to the facts. this game said you can have most of the planes that were used in the pacific. uhhhhh??? i dont see those planes!!! it says that you have to download from their website and get the rest of the 70% of planes that were ot put on the game. the only good planes are the bomber planes and they only have three of them!!! This game lags like crazy if you dont have a nice computer or the very new dell xp that is made to play games. out of all, im gonna say dont waste your money on this game. That includes all airforce pilots who like world war two. p.S how come nobody ever makes a world war I game? that would make good money."
3,p c game,The game is lacking a few of the better way of flying. BUT it is OK for a beginner. After playing most of the WWII games it is passable.
5,Best Flight Sim available,"Incredible Flight Sim...land on carriers...Bombers,fighters,,,you name it...it's in here. Endless scenarios,,night flying,,bad weatherFly any warbird..for any Country...in any campaign..you will love this SimMake sure you have a good joystick !!!!"
1,dont buy pacific fighters or any ubisoft sht,I tried to use it but now find that if your computer has a cd rom with rw or anything that can copy a disc it shows cannot find the disc...now in this day and age what computer doesnt have an rw cd rom..I bought an external cd rom and it still cant find pacific fighters cd...what a waste ubisoft
1,5 stars for an unreleased game?,"I'm sure the game will be well done, but what do we gain from a 5 star rating for a game that isn't scheduled for release until late NOVEMBER. Please play it before you rate it.Thank you"
3,wait 4 Felica,She is the new character that will be appreaing in the campfire line soon! she is gorgeous! [...]She is the AA girl in the middle!The dolls comming out this year rule!Meggie
4,Enjoyed by a Barbie lover,"I gave this Doll to a young girl who collects barbies. She enjoyed the Christmas present and is displaying the doll. It is nicely presented. I have never actually touched the material (and cannot vouch for the quality of any of the materials), but the detail and presentation are beautiful and satisfyed a young (12 yrs old) girl who collects them."
5,A Spanking Good Read...and YOU could use a spanking!,"At last! Well,as of this writing,not quite at last. But none the less,there you are. Previously only availble in ""Galleys"",""Long Jim"" Yoakum's magnus opiate,is now availble to people other than Pirates and Pirate cooks! The best book on Montgomery Pythagrius I have personally never even seen!! Much better than the works of Kim ""No Beard"" Johnson,and ""Hook FootBob"" Ross. So matey's if ye be a Pirate or a Parrot,or just love bad sailors in general,you could do worse than set down a sack of doubloons for this bundle of carefully stitched together paper! Any Semen worth his salt would tell ye: "" paper is good fer writin' on!"". And to ""Long Jim"" we say ""Write on,Man!"".Dead men tell no tales....but their 5 mates usually do. (And friends of dead pirates too).Arrrrrrr."
3,My wife's play tool!,"Great product ..... cuts away fuzz balls on most fabrics .......does not damage goods ..... a bit 'under powered' will purchase anon battery unit to do heavy duty ""Fuzz Busting"" to suppliment thisunit. Takes ""C"" batteries ...would prefer that it took ""AA"" batteriesso that the unit could be easily recharged ..... Hate to buy disposibles!My wife has lots of fun with this product! I think she's getting addictedto ""Fuzz-Busting"" :)"
4,Great product considering the price,"I bought this in 2006 and it still works as well as it did back then. This is not a heavy duty shaver, but it is very effective at removing piling and fuzz from sweaters and pants. While I will agree with other reviewers that its not the fastest, it serves its purpose and shaves fabric without damaging it. And for the price I paid, I'm not complaining about the speed, or lack thereof."
2,worked well at the beginning,"My mom had something like this years ago and loved it, so after searching around I purchased this. It worked well right after I bought it, but never like I thought (hoped) it would. I've had it about 2 yrs and now it doesn't work at all, even after replacing batteries. At least it didn't cost too much."
2,get a bigger model,"This item was very low cost, but didn't last long for me and didn't have the strength I needed for my sweaters. It would have been worth it in the long run to spend a little more money and get a stronger/better shaver. Mine didn't even last 1 winter season."
2,Just OK,"I had previously used a fabric shaver that sucked all the pills off my sweaters without a problem. This shaver is more tedious - I have to make multiple passes before I get the pills removed, and on a very-pilly sweater I have, I actually gave up. It didn't seem worth it to spend over an hour removing pills. I wouldn't recommend this shaver - I think you DO get what you pay for."
3,It's slow but steady,"I bought this to handle full-sized sheets that had pilled very badly. It's not the fastest machine going, but it did finally get rid of the pills. I had to keep going over the areas, but I did get rid of all the pills. The sheets went from feeling like I was sleeping with sand in the bed back to feeling smooth. It's easy to work and it does a good job of catching the pills in the container. The reason I only gave it three stars is the fact that it took multiple passes to clear all the pills."
3,Only average,"I've had this a long time. It shaves as well as any other, but every few seconds the fuzz clogs up the blades, and you have to stop and shake the fuzz down into the holder part. I wouldn't buy it again, and even though it still works, I'm shopping for a replacement right now,"
1,You Get What You Pay For!,"I wouldn't give this item a single star if I could! I know that this shaver is inexpensive, but it should at least work for the $8 you have to pay between the shaver and the shipping. I bought a new one of these, got it in the mail, put in the battery, and it worked for all of 10 minutes before going dead and refusing to work again, even with new batteries. Even when working, it didn't shave much and I had to go over the same area repeatedly with minimal results. All I can tell you is that you shouldn't waste your money on this shaver! I have lost all respect for the Remington name and some respect for Amazon for carrying such a piece of cheap trash."
4,not bad,"if you buy this remember to buy the 'C' battery for it. also if you use it for too long it tends to smell like something burning , but it goes away if you just ignore it. you also have to claen it regularly(my sweater had a lot of lint ) and you might have to go over the same spot more than once. but other than that it works well. i am very happy with my purchase and have recomended it to others as well. the sweater came out 'like new' which is better than i could hope for.i recommend this for a very nice quick fix to lint."
1,terrible product,"I bought two of these, one for work and one for home. They are so cheap that the one at home broke the same day and the second one at work is on its last leg. IT doesn't work that well either. Save your money."
1,Foil broke to pieces during 1st use!,"This item worked until the foil started to fall apart. I called customer service from Remington and they told me that they would send out a new foil, which never came. I guess I should have boought a more expensive product."
3,A quick day read.,"This is storyline that has been worked before but it was still a fun read. A movie star escapes hollywood to Plentiful Wyoming where she becomes a bartender, painter and nanny. She falls for the local Vet... A cute story not sure it was my favorite of this author. If you enjoy this genre, I would also suggest Body Check by Deirdre Martin , Wedding Survivor by Julia London, Glory Days by Irene Peterson and Squeeze Play by Kate Angell."
4,And Then He Kissed Me,"And Then He Kissed Me by Patti Berg, is about a famous actress/mystery author who escapes the celebrity spotlight by running away to find herself. Along the way, she finds unexpected love, and the truth about the people he trusted most. This is a scandalous novel filled with romance, revenge, and deceit. The author did a great job creating believable characters and events by incorporating realistic situations and experiences. She teaches her readers that being yourself is more important than fame and riches. This is demonstrated when the main character learns that people like her better when she isn't trying to please everyone and she speaks her true feelings. I recommend this book to those who enjoy reading about the Hollywood lifestyle and romance. However, this book is not suitable for young children due to its adult content."
2,Puzzled ?,"Nothing covers my problem in the Amazon menu. I've been trying to contact someonewho can tell me what to do. for my problem listed below.I opened my SP 62 package, it looked completely different than the SP 62's Ihad been buying the last two years, after they replaced the DF 10. I triedthem in the razor and I hard time fitting the cover over them, and shavedwith them, but they didn't cut. It seemed like the cutter wasn't gettingfully on my face. I just read some of the reviews which say they werefine. If I ask for a replacement, I wouldn't want the same foil and cutter.I could return yours and mine to show you the difference.Although I'm not sure if the package they arrived in was yours or my oldone.Can you give me any instructions on how to handle this ?Thank you,Dennis Long"
1,Cutters not right,"This is not the same cutter as the original Remington part for SP-62. Performance seems OK, but it makes the shaver much louder."
1,Worthless,"The foil is far thicker than the original foil for my DA307 model. Therefore it doesn't even cut my facial hair. I am forced to keep this purchase simply because I needed both a new cutter and foil, truly false advertising/ poor engineering; the cutter works, so far. While I look for another shaver, no sense in paying for 2 sets of defective replacement parts for the same price, I am struck by the number of poor ratings that this product has received. My bad - next time I'll read the reviews, noting about 50% gave a 1 or 2 of 5 (quite an inverse bell curve for reviews). Oh Yes, The replacement spring works great!"
2,not all there,The product was short the springs that normally are included. I am disappointed that the picture on the web included 3 items and when the shipment arrived it was not as specified in the picture on the web. Not happy.
2,bent foil,"One of the two foils was slightly bent when it was received and now less than 45 days since it was received and used, the foil is now torn. Very disappointed with this product."
3,Works Great,Got these for my Grandpa who doesn't want to switch shavers and can't find them anywhere else. He says they work great but I think the price is to high and cheaper to buy a whole new shaver.
1,Item broke within two weeks,We received the replacement foil and while we were on vacation the foil got a hole in it so we have to order another one. The last one we received lasted the full 3 months maybe this was a defective item?
2,Should have believed the bad reviews,I have had 2 DA307 shavers in the past 6 years and liked them both. I thought I would treat my 1 year old one to a new set of cutters --- big mistake! Now it misses areas that I go over twice and takes a lot longer to shave. It reminds me of the F3790 shaver that I quit using after a month. I put the old cutters back in and am satisfied again. This is my last purchase of anything Remington.
5,Pretty good timing and the correct parts,"Pretty good timing and the correct parts. I was able to quickly find, order, and receive the parts for my razor"
1,terrible service,The product never arrived and I received no response to two follow up messages to the company. Very dissappointed!!!!
3,hmmmm,I haven't used the new screen or blades yet but they look totally different from the old ones hope the blades don't cut through the screen LOL
1,Delicate construction,"The style of shaver head that was sent to me was not the correct shaver head as was advertised. In trying to install it, the delicate construction (much more so than the original part) was damaged making it not returnable."
5,"Tustin, CA","Wonderful price for this product (<$20.00). The blades are styled a little differently than all the previous ones I have ever bought, but can't tell any difference when I use my shaver. They look different than in the picture."
2,Only Fits New Model Shaver,"When I ordered this cutter set the screen said it was a discontinued item by Remington. So, I assumed that it would fit my older model DA307 shaver. Bad assumption. Guess I should have asked first.What I received was the newly designed replacement cutter set - it does not fit my older DA307.Fortunately I had recently purchased a new model DA307 as the older one is getting long in the tooth.However, it was a diappointment. I won't order from them again.The discontinued note is now gone from this seller's page, but it still suggests that it's the old design - it says ""Only 4 left"" as if they are running out of stock of the older design."
1,Overpriced Shaver Foil & Cutter,Works well. Way too much expensive. Cost just a little less than the whole shaver itself with screen and cutter.
3,Replacement Foil,"I rated this product a 3 star for the following reasons. The shaver is fairly new and the foil started coming apart exposing the sharp blades inside. I cut myself with it before I noticed! So I felt it had failed prematurely. I only wanted to replace the foils, but they are only sold as a kit with a new set of cutter blades! I wish I could have just bought the foil only. This shaver works very well and cost very little, but now I've nearly doubled my original purchase price due to their strategy of not inferring the foils separately.!"
3,Fits short,The screen and spring fit well. The cutters are short 2 blades on each side than the original. It does the job but your going to get shorter.
3,Takes me longer to shave,"In 2010, Remington started giving us a new design of SP-62 without warning. It was a narrower design, and did not seem to cut as well. Further it was not the original design meaning pieces could not be mixed and matched. The result was a series of 1-star ratings after the product got mostly 4-5 star ratings. They have apparently gone back to the original screen but the cutter is still the new one. I find it takes me considerably longer to shave than I used to. There is nowhere else to go. I don't like the feel of Norelco shavers, and Braun shavers are far too expensive. Using a razor encounters the chance of scraping my face. I will therefore stick with this brand but wish I could have something that could do the job quicker."
1,This junk foil is too dangerous for your face,"After using several months only, the surface of foil was broken during shaving and made scratches in my face. Compared to the old ones, this new foil is too thin to be broken anytime while you are shaving."
1,Damaged product,"I bought two of these this purchase. The first one had a defective screen, one half of the screen had a crease in it, that turned into a razor blade immediately. These screens tend to wear out and when they do, holes appear in the screen and become very sharp edges that cut and scrape. This new one came out of the package that way.Since the postage is as much as the cost of the item, it is just another of those bad experiences."
4,Works just fine,This product worked just fine. Yes it does look different than the cutter that was in there. Evidently the design has changed.
3,fff,Great show..Great sh ow..Great show..Great show..Great sh ow..Great sh ow..Great show..Great show..Great show..Great show..Great sh ow..Great show..Great show..Gre at show..Great show..Great show..Great show..Great show..Great show..Great show..Great show..Great show..Great show..Great show..
1,A serious downgrade,"I've been using a Remington Microscreen 2 (DA 307) for years. It still works great, and I've been buying new screens and blades once a year, switching to Amazon last year when stores stopped selling them. This year the blade design was noticeably different - narrower overall, with a different shape for each blade. It didn't shave nearly as closely as the old design, and now, after only three months, the redesigned blades have ripped a big flap off the screen, something I've never had happen before. Doesn't Remington test their designs? If they do, they must know this is inferior. If they just want to motivate us to buy new razors, it worked, but my new razor won't be a Remington."
1,Horrible Cheap Replacement Blades,You are warned. Do NOT waste your money on these replacement blades. They do not look like or perform like the original blades. Don't know if they were redesigned by Remington or if they are cheap knockoff counterfeit blades being packaged and sold as Remington's. Impossible to get even a mediocre close shave using these blades. You're better off continuing to use your old worn out blade while you look for a new shaver. These blades are a major rip-off!
1,misrepresentation,Actually this product is not what it appears. The description calls for a replacement cutter and screen for (among others)the DA-370 Remington razor but the actual product shipped is the wrong size...obviously the wrong size. It's sad too as apparently the proper cutter and screen are no longer available. Sad as this is probably the best razor I have ever used. I tried to call it to Amazon's attention but they couldn't have cared less. Sad!
1,Was not packaged properly for shipping,The product was not packaged properly so the glass part(s) were shattered and broken when it arrived. Amazon.com has a great return policy and excellent customer service so returning the damaged product and getting a refund was hassle-free.
4,Entertaining game,I bought this for my three year old son. I would say that he is too young for this game. It is fun and we do play it together but he could not play it independently. It is basically a memory game where you have to listen to what the characters say and then go find/fetch the item you need.I would say four and up is a better age for it.
1,Junk,"I had the same problems as the previous review. Instructions are terrible. Doesn't anybody actually write instructions with words instead of using pictures anymore? The thing never worked. I tried filling the water to different levels other than the fill line just to see if it would work, it didn't. Then I thought the pump might be defective. I don't know if the car doesn't get pressurized or what since the cap never releases. I give up. Don't waste your money."
3,Summer Reading,"This was my assigned summer reading book for my freshman year of highschool. While the subject matter was interesting enough, trying to discern what would and would not be important was challenging. The author does a good job of explaining the main concepts in this book, but they sometimes get lost in the plethera of analogies and comparisons. This is not a light read, but I would recommend it to someone who is interested in the topic. Make sure you have a good amount of time before starting it, as it takes a while to fully grasp all the information in this book."
2,"A highly informative, but complicated book.","I think this book was highly informative, throroughly explaining the course of disease and infections dating back to the very begining of time. However, since I am only 15 I don't think I understood the book as well as others who are older. It was on the list for summer reading, but I think that it is a little to much for some one who is going to be a sophmore in High School. I beleive that if I came back in about 5 years and read it again, I would get so much more out of it."
2,"Groundbreaking, but not readable","I recently bought this book because of what seemed to be endless recommendations from professors and Amazon readers. I was, however, disappointed when I opened it. I read the first 200 pages, inching my way forward, dismayed since the cover reviews included words like ""inspiring"", ""page turning"" and ""ground-breaking."" The material is that of a science journal, and the prose mimics that of an economic one.I have skipped this book on my list, which distresses me since this is that first time that I have actually put down a book in the middle of reading it. Maybe when I feel braver (or read a few more economic journals for preperation) I will finish it. In the meantime, I recommend the book ""Guns, Germs and Steel"" as a substitute."
3,Read For My AP History Class,"I gave this book 3 Stars, not because it was a bad book, but because I could not get very interested in reading it (Keep in mind I am only in High School). I read this book for my AP World History Class in High School. Upon completion I had to answer 18 Questions (7 long answer and 11 short answer). I believe that had I been older I would have comprehended much more and got a lot more from the book. There were however, parts of the book that really did get my attention and kept me wanting to read. But there were other parts that I could not wait to finish. The ideas were original and innovative. I would reccomend this book to anyone who is interested in the topic, wants a challenging read, or wonders about diseases and epidemics.Roc-A-Fella 4 Life"
3,Great facts-boring outline,"The book Plagues and Peoples has been intended for people to recognize and be aware of how human beings or ""homo sapiens"" evolved. Starting from being apelike creatures living in trees to being a very complex society. It gives you the details on how every organism helped and developed how history and the very being of man came out to be. All of this facts are greatly interesting and gives you knowledge in the theme of the book but it lacks the spark that a book must have to keep the reader- reading. You really have to be in an isolated place free from distraction, and that is any to fully understand the message being transported to you. Furthermore the outline of it seems very formal which adds to it's being boring. As I said before this book had great facts but also a boring outline!"
2,"Informative, but highly difficult to comprehend","Plagues and Peoples was a required reading book for my Sophmore AP History class. I found it to be extremly hard to read from the first few pages. I had no interest in it at all and found myself skiming it towards the end. Although I didn't find it a good read, it was very imformative and gave alot of interesting facts about the world and the diseases that occupy it. I only recommend this book to people who like ones of this nature and can easily comprehend such works. I don't however recommend it for High School students in grades lower than the 11th."
5,Good book great price,This is a very interesting book it makes you think about the role diseases have played to make the worlds human populations come to exist as they do. I started reading it after I read the book guns germs and steel by jared diamond and both of these books are great and cover different aspect of disease. I am not completely done with the book but I am already planning on rereading it as there is so much interesting information that I think it is worth reading again in a few months.
5,Bio-Materialist History,"Other reviews have captured the breadth of this powerful and provoking analysis; I can't add anything more. However, one unoticed aspect is how McNeill silently engages with Marx's economic materialist analysis by showing before you can have a base, let alone a superstructure, you must have control of or a standoff with infectious diseases. Thus in some ways, his dialectical interplay between macro- and micro- parasitism is in fact even more ""radical"" than Marx, if ""radical' is used in the original sense (to get at the root). What is disappointing is that nobody has followed up since using McNeill's fertile insights."
4,Epidemic is historic,"I bought this book from Amazon, and I read it here, in Brazil.This book is really good, about this subject.In fact, epidemic killed far more peoples than all wars and dictators together.Lenin or Hitler were small killers than smallpox.In fact, smallpox exterminated, more than 70% of indian population of Mexico in XVI Century.Illness decided wars, religions, poltics and economics for all the history.This book is very good, but being writen in 1975, this book is now a little outdated.A new sexual desease(AIDS) became a reality and after DDT's banishment, malaria is back and strong in Africa,Asia and Latin America."
4,This book is very good for the fantasy beginner,"As far as I can tell, this is the first book in a series of four written by Rose Estes for Greyhawk Adventures. This was the first fantasy book that I ever read. I would highly recommend this book to those of you that aren't familiar with reading fantasy. It is a good one for beginners. If you've already read the Lord of the Rings or The Wheel of Time, you'll probably think it to be a little less intellectually stimulating. However, this book is a very colorful beginning to an extremely entertaining four book saga."
4,D&D novel for the series reader.,"Even D&D has spawned several series of novels. The Greyhawk Adventures is one of the better known (after the Forgotten Realms series).Make sure you read the books in numerical order, they make more sense."
3,Slight buzz but it lingers,"The buzz didn't hit me right away but it lingers. I'm a coffee drinker so I equate the feeling from this gum to drinking tea - it slowly gives me energy but not right away like coffee. One piece is not enough - I usually have two every couple of hours. The gum tastes like skittles for the first couple of minutes and then goes completely bland. This may be useful in places where coffee isn't allowed:tests/class/library. Keep it in your bag just in case. If you're at home, you'd be better off with coffee and espresso."
5,Tasty but not caffinated,"I like the taste of this gum. It's my favorite of the Penguin gum line. Two or three pieces of this gum helps keep me more alert during meetings. However, a single piece of gum does not give me a noticeable energy boost. The Penguin mint line advertises that 3 mints contain the caffeine equivalent of a typical caffeinated cola. I don't know how many of these Chicklet shaped pieces have the equivalent taurine and guarana of a Red Bull, but I suspect you need more than a few. Unlike Penguin mints, this gum is not caffeinated. If you want a caffeine buzz, check out Penguin mintsPenguin Caffeinated Mints - Peppermints 1.75 ounce tin. I heartily recommend both products."
2,I am not impressed,"Besides literally losing its flavor in less than 30 seconds, I have noticed no significant energy boost from this gum."
1,Joan Rivers live at the Palladium,"Joan Rivers live at the PalladiumI thought this would be a comical show. What I got was a poorly filmed, course monlogue laced frequently with the ""F"" word and even the ""C"" word. The camera was too far back from Joan and the film was of poor quality. Joan had a cold and her speech was hard to hear and sometimes indistinct. The DVD was a disaapointment, I will not be paying it a second time, it is in the garbage. I guess my expectations of a witty show was not met."
2,Very Disappointing -,"Wasn't very funny at all, and not that much reaction from the audience. Some of the material was sick - eg. making fun of former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Alzheimer's. Then dragging around her supposedly deceased dog's fur, and claiming it committed suicide like her husband. Poor taste."
5,Great Vegetarian Cook Book!,This is the second copy of this cook book we have purchased. My daughter loves her copy so much she thougth that her aunt who is a vegetarian would love it too! The soups are great!
4,Tasty (albeit very simple) recipes.,"I bought this book for my older brother, who loved the Redwall books, and also for my roommate, who loves cooking vegetarian food. Great for vegetarians, lots of cute pictures and poems, and really tasty! Some of the recipes are a little overly-simple (but I didn't realize the book was for younger children before buying it). Also, the book is a little difficult to lay flat while cooking b/c of its paperback binding, but all in all, no complaints."
4,Very cute book,"I bought this for my son who is a Redwall fan and he loves it. I thought it might be a little to young for him, he is 13, but he has been reading and looking at it ever since he got it. He has picked out several recipes to try, we haven't had time yet to make any of them but they all look very good. I am glad I purchased this item."
4,Pretty cute...,"This cookbook is pretty cute with lots of fun pictures from the ""Redwall"" books. It has most of the foods mentioned in these books in this cookbook. My only problem is that is has too many pictures and not enough recipes. This cookbook would be great for a younger person who loves to cook and loves the books."
5,Great for Redwall Lovers,Bought this for a Redwall reader. They loved it and didn't even know they made a cookbook. Fun stories and colorful illustrations go along with each simple recipe. The book is divided by seasons for the recipes.
5,Fun for a cook,"My best friend wanted this for her birthday, so I got it for her.She is a big fan of Redwall, and was beyond excited to have therecipes.Great product!"
2,Birks,Birks are the only shoes I can wear due to neuropathy/ arthritis. I was so excited when I received these. I rarely wear these because the top straps are floppy and due to no feeling in my feet I can't get my toes under them. I have several other pairs of Arizonas & they are quite easy to get on becase these upper straps are stiff & stand up. I am very disappointed with these.
4,exactly as expected,"I once have owned a pair of similar style. It was very comfortable and lasted quite long time. Not for wearing in the office, but great for vacation. I like the color of this one, very subtle."
3,Not true to size,"I am a lover of Birkenstock shoes, but this particular one did not seem to run to size, was too large and the inner sole of the was very hard. I prefer a soft sole and did not compare to other Arizona styles that I have worn. Good looking shoe, but not what I expected."
1,this is questionable,"i dont know what this is all about....i vaguely remember clicking on it but got a response like ""this video is no longer available"". So it may very well be a very good thing but I cannot prove it since I did not find it was available to me."
1,Are You Mad At Me?,"Thanks to Billy Ray for taking an interesting story and turning it into an After School Special. ""Shattered Glass"" is ""All the President's Men"" for stupid people. It has one redeaming element -- an outstanding performance by Peter Sarsgaard. Otherwise, this is another example of how low the bar has dropped for what is considered intelligent American filmmaking today. Yes, Billy Ray, I am mad at you."
4,Good movie!,"""Shattered Glass"" is a really good movie that is based on the true story of Stephen Glass (played by Hayden Christiansen), a talented young journalist working at the New Republic who begins fabricating his stories. Christiansen gives a great performance and his character is very likeable, which is why his coworkers are quick to jump to his defense, even when his lies bubble to the surface. The only think that confused me about this movie at first was that it was a bit unclear what scenes were occurring in ""present tense,"" since there are so many flashbacks. However, the director's intention was to have the audience wondering about which flashbacks were actually real and which ones were based on Stephen's fabrications, and that was very effective."
4,Glass Half Empty.,"Brilliant portrayal of this total fabricator that duped The New Republic and others with his articles in the 90's. But the defining moment comes in the 60 MINUTES interview with the real Stephen Glass which is on the DVD as well. I wanted to reach through the screen and punch this man - what a piece of work.He looks right at the camera and continues to create this sense that he was not responsible for the stories that he made up and the damage he did. That he is a victim of ... ? Society, work, pressure - he keeps pushing the theme that he just wants to be loved/liked/forgiven. And he's pursuing a career in law.How apropos."
5,An interesting film with an impressive acting role,"This highly-praised film version of the story of star reporter Stephen Glass -- who faked dozens of stories in the late 1990s -- includes one really great performance. It's not, as many felt, that of the lead, Hayden Christensen, who perfectly mimics the mannerisms of the real-life Glass yet never gives his performance enough warmth to explain why the guy was such a good con man. Rather, it's Peter Sarsgaard, who plays Glass's editor at ""The New Republic"" magazine, who proves unflappable and resolute in the face of a manipulative, weasly -- yet wildly popular young reporter. It's a beautifully measured, deliciously nuanced performance, and well worth the price of admission alone. Provocative script as well, which can really make you think about the issues at hand."
5,Teaches a lesson without any preaching,"This excellent film presents the case of Steven Glass, a young hotshot journalist who ended up inventing stories and then presenting them as if they were true, much to the shame and disgrace of himself, his colleagues, and the magazine they worked for. Lesson: if you can't manage the work, get out of it or ask for help. Don't drag yourself down and others with you. There is no excuse for the fabrication, any more than there is any excuse for plagiarism. This is fraud, plain and simple.Oh, and if you're having doubts about Hayden C. in the starring role, put them aside. He can act very well when he's not in a George Lucas film."
3,an interesting little tale about the do's and dont's of journalism,"I enjoyed this tale, The cast did a nice job, Hayden's acting is much better here than what we saw from the star wars prequels. Its worth watching if you have an iterest in stories that are based on real life events. Also its amazing to think that somone could get away with this in an industry based on obtaining and verifying information."
5,Exceptionally interesting,"The Bottom Line:An excellent character piece that develops into a slow-burn thriller, Shattered Glass not only features recorded history's sole compelling performance by Hayden Christiansen, but showcases a fine cast of young actors in a fascinating piece of filmmaking that almost never takes a wrong step; even those uninterested in journalism will find much to treasure here.3.5/4"
4,A very good movie,"This movie surprised me by being quite good. I agree with the reveiewer below when he says ""Hayden Christensen can act,"" as this movie testifies to. I hope to see more of him in future films. I also highly recommend ""Life as a House"" starring Hayden and Kevin kline--Hayden's performance in ""Glass"" is excellent, he'll blow you out of the water in ""House."""
4,Cynical approach for journalism.,"This is quite the good film that could be made with low-budget, and have quite cynical apporoach for journalism. Stephen Glass, who worked at The New Republic, had fabricated lots of story for his ambition to be a great journalist. I honestly can understand him, beacause I also have been studying journalism to be a newspaper reporter. But Writing fictions are never permitted in the world of journalism, and consequently HE WAS WRONG. This movie (also DVD) shows us the small workplace, but I have been thinkin' that this is our real world."
5,Fine translation,"If you can't read Montale's stunning poetry in Italian, this is the next best thing, and for those new to Montale's work the fairly extensive notes will be very helpful. I've not read every one of the translated poems, but the ones I have read retain the poet's voice."
3,How to Publish Your Children's Book,I am about half way through this book and so far I'm finding it very informative. I've never written a book before so obviously am very green to the publishing world. This book so far has given me a great deal of insight into the publishing world and has prevented me from just plundering forward with the process. I am realizing I have a lot to learn before submitting my manuscript.
5,Felt strange,I didn't enjoy wearing these and they didn't do what I was hoping - maybe I didn't use them enough? Even though they were the size small they felt too big for my feet - the stretching was painful like ligaments being pulled and sharp pains shooting in weird places in my feet.
4,ok for me,Toe-stretchers For Beautiful Healthy Feet for Men and Women - Small SizeI didn't wish to spend $40+ to try this type of product. I have practiced yoga for 40+ years so understand the process. These work very well for me. Am not unhappy with the purchase.
2,terrible,in my opinion these toe stretchers are terrible. they didnt' fit correctly on my toes and were extremely uncomfortable.
2,Disappointment,"As a big Susan Andersen fan, I was looking forward to reading Obsessed. I was so disappointed in this book. Vincent, the ""hero"" carries his distrust of women way too far and it continues throughout most of the book. I was very surprised at Ivy tolerating his treatment as it bordered on cruel. The plot was very good but I found myself sidetracked by Vincent's continual self-pity and Ivy's lack of self-esteem. It's hard to imagine a woman putting up with Vincent's treatment."
2,"Somewhat dark, but characters are too two-dimensional, and do stupid things","Susan Andersen's ""Obsessed"" is about a cop bent on finding a rapist who carves a broken heart onto his victims, and the spitfire ER doctor who is caught in the middle. While Ivy Pennington and Vincent D'Ambosino fight and then fall in love, the rapist becomes more and more fixated on Ivy, and will stop at nothing to be close to her. Vincent finds out, and tries to portect Ivy, but both do incredible stupid things, and it leads to a climax where the rapist and Ivy are alone in her apartment. The characters are flawed, but too much time is spent on their flaws, and Andersen seems afraid to reveal the rapist full pathology as we never learn who he has an eternal grudge against."
1,Sorely Disaapointing,This book is entirely too slow. The stalker has only shared his thoughts with readers one time and I'm on page 130 for God's sake!! Just when is the intrigue going to begin with this book. All it's talking about is Ivy and her family members. I don't see the relevance. I've already established that she's a well-known and well-liked physician so why all this unnecessary mumbo jumbo. I'll try to finish the novel but I can make no promises for I am already thinking about lighting a fire and throwing this novel in it!!!
2,not a keeper,"The major problem I had with this book is the hero: he's not likeable or sympathetic. I really wanted to say to the heroine, ""Dump him. You can find someone who will really appreciate you!"""
2,out of the bedroom,I really enjoyed the story line of this book. I have not read any of Ms. Andersen's earlier books so I have no way of knowing if this is her standard fare. I would have enjoyed this much more if there had been more story and less cavorting.
2,From Back Cover,"A Madman's Game...For him, the thrill lies in the hunt. In striking only when the moon is full. In his victims' agony as he leaves them with the perfect calling card: a broken heart carved into their chests......Could End With Her LifeAfter months on the trail of the twisted Seattle serial rapist, Detective Vincent D'Ambruzzi is closing in on his quarry--no thanks to the uncooperative Ivy Pennington, M.D. Soon, D'Ambruzzi discovers that he isn't the only one infuriated--and captivated--by the beautiful ER physician. Hidden in the shadows, looming closer with every phase of the moon, is the stranger he seeks--and he's bent on making Ivy his next victim..."
4,"A little action, mystery, and romance","I'm not going to say that this book was necessarily a page-turner, but it did have a good plot and a very sinister antagonist. It's definitely worth reading, it's just not the kind of book that I'd stay up all night to read."
2,not a keeper,"I agree with the previous reviewer (Nicole) that Obsessed is not Susan Andersen at her best. I bought it after having read reviews saying that the hero is difficult to like; I assumed that I would like the book anyway; I didn't. In my opinion, he is the weak point of the book. There's little suspense since the villain is given away early on; the sexual tension between the hero and heroine is difficult to sustain since he is so unpleasant. It's nice to know that Ms Andersen has improved so much."
5,Her best yet!,Susan has produced her best book yet. The relationship between Vincent and Ivy is realistic and well developed. Over and over I marveled at how well she developed the struggles Vincent went through as he felt pulled to Ivy. Her attention to important detail was right on target for the story. This is a read you will not be able to put down until the last page. If I had one complaint it would be the way she left me wondering about the side plot involving Jaz and Terry. Don't leave us like that - it was not a satisfying finish for those two (or was that deliberate?).
1,Where's the lyrics?,"I was excited to not only get the music for ""I can only imagine,"" but also other songs for a good price; however, when I received the music it had no lyrics for any of the songs. Also, some music will have the chords for guitar, but not this one. In addition, if you'd like to play this in church, beware because it states: ""...public performance is an infringement of copyrights. Infringers are liable under law."" Wonderful. I can't even play this for my Christian brothers and sisters without breaking the law. Praise the Lord, but don't do it with this music in public."
3,Good but not great,"Was disappointed in this release, especially the ""ode to a black man"" cover which adds nothing to the original. Overrated and overhyped, but under realised. No doubting the quality of Mick Collins' voice, but it is wasted here."
2,Overrated,"The idea behind this album is a good one (revisiting Chambers Brothers psychedelic sould and giving it a Nuggets-style garage edge). Unfortunately, the execution is not as good as others seem to think: the singer is pretty obviously imitating other singers and really doesn't have a great voice and the songs are, well, boring and banal and surprisingly undanceable. If they spent as much time working on their songs and peformance as they obviously did on the conception of their sound, they might one day by the saviors others think they are now. Until the, stick with the White Stripes."
1,What? I think my ears are bleeding.,"I saw this ""band"" open for Blondie. Omigod I wanted to die. I thought everyone in the band either couldn't sing, or had a hangover, and forgot how music is supposed to sound."
3,Not So Happy,"I thoroughly enjoyed tracks number 2, 10, and 11, but I found myself disappointed with the rest of the album. This album has songs that are contemporary and traditional. The traditional cuts are by far the best. The contemporary cuts left me wanting more of the traditional, and I love all types of gospel music. In my opinion, this would have been a great album if the producers would have stayed true the the traditional gospel style."
1,BS Thing doesnt work,Whoever says this Action Replay cartridge lets you play import games is wrong! I tried using it with a Japanese game I bought and it wont load the game. I have a U.S. Saturn system which is supposed to work. What a worthless waste of money!
3,Good...but not as good...,I do indeed believe this is a good CD... but If you have ever heard their older CD's you would wear them out instead...I think ever since Ray and Ronnie left the Band... they are lacking something... classic shindig is better...
3,"Good history, but only average politics","Morone's study is a fascinating attempt to reinterpret American history through the lens of religion and morality. However, this laudable effort is damaged by his insistence upon maintaining the traditional academic liberal lenses of ""race, class, gender"" in every historical era, as if there were no other ways to understand what happened. He also does not take religion seriously enough to understand why it causes people to act as they do -- I walked away feeling like he was openly contemptuous of religion, despite his apparent interest in it."
3,High Heat,"Shane Hunter lives a privileged life. He has a great house, a great family, and goes to a great school. On top of that he is the best closing pitcher for baseball anyone has seen in high school in a long time. But that all changes when the police show up to arrest his father.Shane's life changes quickly and dramatically. He resents his new life and starts to fall into bad habits with bad people. But there is still hope for Shane. He has a strong group of people trying to help him, he just needs to learn to let them.Baseball plays a very major role in the story and I really don't know much about it. That may have been one of the reasons I did not rate this as highly as I may have. Also, there were times Shane came across a bit wrong to me. Not incorrect wrong, but there was just something off in the way he behaved that didn't quite flow with the story.Othewise, this was a great story of dealing with life.3/5"
5,Great Squeakers,"I make baby quilts with soft, removable shapes. I like to stuff them with squeakers as a little suprise. These work great. Not sure if they would be durable enough for dog toys however."
5,Great for replacement squeakers,"My dog loves the Kong football, but the squeaker in those comes out or damages pretty easily, especially after she gets a tooth through it. This is the cheapest way I have found to get new squeakers for the football (you only need the little squeaker insert, not the part you squish to make the air flow through the squeaker). That's important for anyone doing what I'm doing to know, that you can separate this squeaker and use it in any of kong tennis ball material toys."
2,Seller misrepresented product,"I bought two of these books. I LOVE this story, and it's my favorite book to give when a friend has a son, and gives birth to a baby girl. However the sellers of the books did not disclose that there was writing in the books they sold me...words crossed off and other words written over it (changing the story ending), or stickers inside the front cover (this book belongs to...). Had I been told this information, I would have looked to purchase the books from someone else. The book is out of print, and hard to get, but I do know there are undamaged books available. Very disappointed with the product purchased."
3,decent,"Compact, not quite as small as other travel dryers I've seen but small enough to fit in my drawer folded. Circuit breaker plug is smaller than others I've seen. Has HIGH & LOW plus Cool Shot button. Small red rocker switch is a little difficult to switch.2 main problems for me: Quite loud, high pitched noise hurts my ears on high. The intake filter is NOT removable nor even easily cleanable as back is one piece molded with LOTS of small deep holes and filter screen inside. I can't see how it would even come apart.I wouldn't have chosen it if I'd seen it first."
5,Just what the Title implies - The Ultimate Collection,"This dynamic duo brought hope to the 80's that individuality was still alive and creative life can emerge beyond synthesizers and spandex. I cant help listening to this when driving in my car - is it that surreal Love is a Stranger in an Open Car beat or Annie belting out Sweet Dreams? I dont know, but its a must have for those of us who survived the 80's without skads of pictures of ourselves with big band hair or garbed up like Madonna. Bless you Annie and Dave..."
2,A wasted opportunity,"What a wasted opportunity to update their Greatest Hits CD. They missed (again) the single Beethoven (I Love To Listen To) and missed (this time, not in the first Greatest Hits CD) the song ""Don't ask my why"" which certainly it's a crime. Nobody can get a complete picture of Eurythmics style and hits without those 2 songs, specially ""Don't ask my why"". This CD is advisable as a complement to their first greatest hits CD, but if you are looking for your first Eurythmics CD and don't want to buy any of their albums, you will be better off buying their first Greatest Hits CD, not this one."
1,Doesn't compare to the music of Lady Gaga or La Roux!,"I was watching MTV the other day and felt so blessed to be around in 2010 because how wonderful music is now! It's so sad to know that back in the 80s they had to tolerate this junk! Songs like ""sweet dreams"" and ""here comes the rain again"" are perfect examples of how terrible these musicians were and how bad 80s music is!! Why arent there lyrics about pimpz, hoez, or rimz!?!? Why doesn't the singer get caught lip syncing or get thrown in jail for being a drug addict!?!? This isn't real music!!For good music check out Britney Spears, Jessica Simpson, Lindsay Lohan, LA ROUX and LADY GAGA!"
4,Eurythmics,This CD was a super example of why the Eurythmics stay popular through the decades! Annie Lennox has a unique voice and delivery on every song
5,"I have missed the ""Eurythmics""","i am right this moment enjoying this ""Eurythmics Ultimate Collection"" when amazon bugged me with an e-mail asking me to review it. I think I am going back to that old adage that Big Brother is watching. but never mind my paranoia, the Music is great and doesn't music heal all wounds! Seriously, I wish I was older so that I could have married Annie Lennox."
1,Corrupt CD,"The last five songs of the CD just cannot be played, I've tried different players already but no luck. The rest of the CD is fine."
5,Great Songs from 80's,"I love the Eurythmics, if you love their old songs then you have to have this one.I love them when I was younger so I had to fined them and I just love their songs. If you already love them you have to have this one, If not this is a good one to have."
4,We Too Are No Longer One,"The remastering does sound amazing & the two new tracks (especially ""I've Got A Life"") are modern classics. The only thing I can't comprehend is why the album 'We Too Are One' is left unrepresented. ""Don't Ask Me Why"" & ""Angel"" should be here & because they're not, prevent this from being a true ""Ultimate"" Collection."
2,Yawn!,I read about 1/4 of this book and put it back on the shelf. It's one of the most boring books I've ever encountered. The author goes into way too much detail and describes every minute detail of his life and the war. I find it very hard to believe that I'm the only one with this opinion. Makes me wonder what the other reviewers do for excitement......watch grass grow?
5,The Ultimate War Story,"The world owes a great debt of gratitude to Gary W. Gallagher for his efforts in producing this book. Even though I would consider myself a ""Private"" in the ranks of civil war buffs, I have read dozens of memoirs by Civil War era men and women. None of them moved me the way this book has. At heart, I am a ""Union girl"", but when I finished reading this book and had to close it, I truly felt like I had lost a friend. E. Porter Alexander was a gifted, candid, and witty writer. His reminiscences are like sitting down with your favorite uncle for an evening of story telling by the fire. This book is a treasure, and is definitely worthy of more than one read."
4,Genetics and the Social Behavior of Dogs,This book was very detailed from a research stand point. It is somewhat dated as there have been many advancements in genetics since the 60's. I did take away knowledge about genetics and what does and does not dictate behavior of an animal. A good book in general. I would just like to see an updated version.
1,Waste of money,The product is paper. Super thin paper. Provides NO lift nor do they stick. I only need moderate lift and didn't even get that . The paper ripped during application .
3,10 mile radius is a joke,"I have owned this product for about an year now. It works fine within a half mile to a mile radius (product claims a 10 mile radius). The handsets feel sturdy and very usable. After about an year of use, the battery indicator is always at ""low"" every after an overnight recharge and the unit drops conversations with a crackle. It might just need a new rechargeable battery pack but in the future, I am unlikely to buy a ""Midland"". I do have to add that it was very useful during the time it worked well."
3,Walkie Talkie,The product was what we wanted - a match for walkie talkies we already have. I was disappointed that they did not state that batteries were NOT included.
2,"A little cheesy, but enjoyable","It may be a bit cheesy as it's a pretty old documentary, but I found it enjoyable nonetheless. Being so old I'd actually already seen or heard of many of the attacks and reports that were discussed in the film, but it still wasn't bad. I don't regret watching it."
3,GREAT WHITE DEATH,"LIKED MOVIE BUT WAS VERY OUTDATED, ALOT OF THE INFO THEY WERE QUESTIONING ABOUT SHARKS HAS ALREADY BEEN PROVED OR DISPPROVED."
4,Native American Boy Learns about Life in New York,"The Brave is a story about native American boy who wants to be a boxer. He also wants to find his mother. He goes to New York to do both, but gets distracted by two hustlers. I think it was a good story, but it left a lot of things unanswered. It had too many loose ends and never said what happened to a lot of characters. A good book ties everything up. I think a lot of people would like this story. It is a good book if you like to read about boxing, native Americans, or anything else."
5,The Boxing Brave,"An amazing journey of a teen boy (Sonny Bear) struggling to be somebody. Torn between his friends; Doll and Stick, his parents, and his sport, it's up to him to decide what's best. This book will punch you, beat you into suspense. It makes you think, what would you do in the toughest situation in your life? Will Sonny overcome what faces him in Times Square? Will he grant Officer Brooks' wishes? What family will he choose? Everybody will want to know the ""Sonny Bear story."" ""Sonny Bear is the future."" This is a race ""straight to the title."" Anybody will love the plot. This is a great, inspiring story for all ages, though you may find yourself expecting ""more"" in the heart pounding moments. This is very much so, an amazing mini-novel by Robert Lipstyle. Easily one of the top five sports books in recent years, it keeps you on the edge of your seat and will always keep you wanting more. Enjoy!"
4,Vidal Sassoon Electric Rollers - Excellent,"I find these rollers very effective. Use with a heat protection spray... that makes the hair stay on the roller better when trying to roll your hair up. Also, keep in mind the rollers get VERY HOT and if left plugged in for a long time before using them, they feel extremely hot to the touch. Still, this is the best set I've ever owned for creating effective, long-lasting curls. And you cannot beat the price. It's the cheapest set I could find anywhere... Internet or otherwise!"
4,Sto-Fen Omni-Bounce - very nice add on to your flash gun,This is very nice add on. It's helping to make your picture looking nicer while using flash gun. The light is diffused and picture are really gaining by using Sto-Fen Omni-Bounce.
3,Useful in certain situations,"I bought this with my Digital Rebel package because it seemed like a wise investment. Also, I read a couple reviews elsewhere that recommended it.However, I have found that I generally don't need it because the 420EX is so intelligent. Given that the 420EX gauges the scene and adjusts itself accordingly, to decrease the amount of flash further may underexpose the shot.The Omni-Bounce is handy if you need a really soft light, especially close-up. (The underexposing issue seems more significant as distance gets greater.) So, it can be useful for portraits, shooting something reflective or for fill-flash.The other problem I have is the price; $16.95 for a simple piece of plastic is rather absurd, really. A quarter the price would be more fitting."
3,Not for smaller cameras,"Diffusers like this one work well when the lens barrel/hood extends well in front of the flash -- I bought this one to use with Canon G series and a 420EX, and was disappointed to discover that the combination was unusable -- the direct light from the diffuser strikes the lens and ruins every shot."
4,I like it better for candies,"I tried it once with baked goods and boy, really have to watch them. Mine did come out fine, slid right out of the pan, but I don't care (personally) for spending the day baking over and over. It's small and I have a large family. I would have to spend the whole day baking to get enough to feed my troupe. I found it worked great, though, for candy, especially melted chocolate. I decorated with a few colored sprinkles and a line or two of dark chocolate, white chocolate, and took them to work to share for valentines. Whoosh, they were gone!"
1,Coating missing in spots.,The tin is perfect in size and the heart shape is flawless. However the tin is missing the coating in spots in the bottom of every heart. Bit scared to use it for cupcakes incase the coating comes off.No point in returning it as it would cost me nearly the same price to return it as the product.
2,Norpro nonstick heart pan,Was a bit disappointed with the size of pan and size of hearts. Seemed like a good deal however when I received it it was so much smaller than it appeared in pic. Should have checked it out better before purchase. No problem with anything else quality good and no delivery problems.
4,Slightly Faulty...,"This is not a needed buy, unless you MUST complete your Emily Dickinson Kindle collection. Both the previous volumes were far better and I have bought all three volumes. It is not that there are typos, it's just that the best poetry has already appeared. By which I mean most famous and best lesser known.All in all, this is the black sheep..."
3,A pretty decent history of polymer science,"This book recounts the history of polymer science fairly concisely. As history books are wont to do, it includes quite a bit of discussion of the trial-and-error involved in progressing from incorrect conceptions to correct ones. In spite of the fact that the first two-thirds of the book moves a bit slowly, it still provides a good look at how scientists thought of polymerization during the last 150 years.My main regret is that the book doesn't include all that much about the current state of polymer chemistry - but you and I can buy other books for that information. This book probably is unique in its treatment of chemical history, and so provides a valuable viewpoint of the foundations of modern-day science."
5,Best trucks EVER!!!,"The bushing on INDY's have been sucking for years. Tighten them down and they spill right out of the housing. With all the bushing's available now you can dial these trucks to your liking, so order a new set with these (I like the Doh Doh's). As far as the trucks go, Independent trucks are the best trucks made. They will last for years and are extremely reliable and strong. The way they turn is sooooooo goood!!! Btw, 149's go great on a 8.5 deck."
3,Entertaining but not True!,"This very entertaining serial is a must for all SHADOW lovers. But don't be fooled by the name, he is a completely different Character than the pulp comics hero. His past in Tibet and Ability to cloud mens minds completely left out, leads him to be more like a cheezy Batman serial and not the Shadow. Who Knows What Evil Lurks In The Hearts Of Men? This Shadow doesn't have a clue."
4,"Best shadow laugh in video. Great villian, the black tiger.","While not completely true to the pulps, this is a very entertaining serial. Victor Jory has the moves down and the laugh. Laugh is much better than the Alec Baldwin modern version. The Black Tiger is one of the best gimmick villians ever. Several clever scenes and some campy ones. I taught my african grey parrot the shadow laugh in two days by playing the tape multiple times. Classic video.....jack welch"
4,Not only the shadow knows!,"As a serial afficionado, I thoroughly enjoyed watching this one. Bela Lugosi plays his role as the mysterious Dr Strang well and Robert Warwick adds a touch of professional stage in his role as the famous detective. Bob Kortman is his usual evil self as the escaped convict Slade. Lafe McKee (I love that name) will keep you guessing about his intentions. Some of the acting is, as in many serials atrociously overdramatic, but one must remember that the film was made in 1933 in the early years of the talkies. The endings are standard, but the surprise in the last chapter is who the Shadow turns out to be. It is beyond the last person you would suspect. And the serial contains the most oft-repeated line in serial history: ""This is the last time you have interfered with my plans!"" Hah! Little does the Shadow know about how resilient our hero is. The fighting is bad, the action sequences are limited, but the serial is enjoyable."
1,Horrible piece of material,"This book was a requirement for me since I am a PhD candidate, and I am taking a course that needs this book. However, just because a book is required doesn't mean the book is good. I found this book very hard to read, understand, and stay focus on. I had to use this book to do assignments barely able to lift a sentence and when I did find the right statement, it was worded so gawdy that it gave me a headache. Reseach classes are hard enough...do I need a book that is just as hard....hec no. This book also was published by the authors themselves...you can see why.I wouldnt recommend this book to anyone."
5,Perfect reference book,"If you're used to the Rough Guide travel series, you will recognize the practical, relevant information they offer in this violin/viola guide.The book is tailored to people who are new to the instruments, and it makes a very good buyers guide. If you are interested in buying a violin or a viola, I strongly recommend this book. All the questions you should ask are outlined here.In addition, regular maintenance of your violin, such as string replacement, is clearly explained: it not only tells you how to tell if your strings need replacement, but also has diagrams to show how to wind the string properly on the peg. The most common damages, and how to check for them, are also listed. This makes the book a very useful reference for the more experienced violinist as well, however, I would recommend it most to new players (or to parents of children outgrowing their rental violins.)"
1,looks like glass,"This pendant looks great in the picture but when I received it, it looks like yellow glass, doesn't look like a crystal at all. I'm very dissapointed!"
1,Not as shown,"I ordered this pendant to match some earings I ordered at the same time. Yes they match, but the hues are not as shown. The back of the pendant and earings have a golden finish and they gleam gold. I wanted the tradition Swarovski with all the various hues. Sending these back."
2,Yellowish looking,I was very disappointed in this. I bought it to match a pair of Swarovski Crystal earrings (and it did match perfectly) but my earrings are crystal (pun intended) clear and the pendant has a horrible yellow look to it. I kept it but now I wish I had a clear pendant that matched my earrings. I wish I would've been told in the description that it was not clear. I can't say I'd ever be too eager to purchase from them again.
3,Nicer for a teenager than an adult,"This is a fairly nice looking stone with significant shine. However, the workmanship was not as impressive as I had hoped and I didn't meet my personal standards. I gave it to my 15-year old daughter rather than take the time to return it."
4,Present,"I think the earring make perfect to give to someone as a present, i gave it to my friend as her birthday present and she's really happy about it."
2,got half the order,"The darts are as advertised. Not high buck, but work well. Odered two sets - got one. Never got the second set of darts. Even after numerous emails. So we share."
5,Help I needed!,"Sometimes we need a good dose of truth ... when it's written down,it's even better, easier to grasp and refer back to when needed. Awesome book for some needed 'thought changes' for needed life changes. Perspective. I got the workbook as well, first read the book yrs ago. Very very good."
3,Hard Read but Good Perspective,"I'll admit I didn't make it past the halfway point of this. It is a hard read. Plus this is something you would really rather have in paper form since it is meant to be a workbook that you can write in. Doesn't really translate well to a digi-read.Good perspective and very insightful though in digital form, it's hard to work through."
5,Learning to Tell Myself the Truth,"Is an excellente book that makes you think a lot. If you read Telling yourself the truth, from the same author, you will, certanly, love this one. He touches many other areas and helps you to hear what you are telling yourself, coming out of many misbeliefs. It is worth reading!"
4,Very Helpful!,I found this book to be very helpful - It will walk you through a self-examination with plenty of follow through in the workbook. It is extremely good when used with Experiencing God and Search For Significance.
3,Annie Freeman,I was pleased with the price of the item and also the condition of the book when it arrived. The promptness of the delivery was excellent. I will definitely buy more used books on Amazon.
1,contrived,"I tried and tried to get through this whole book for my book club. But it was so contrived, filled with coincidences, repetitive and stereotypical I just couldn't do it. I read about 2/3 of the book hoping it would get better. The author tries to make the women a ""team"" of sorts knitted together by their love of Annie and of wine, willingness to wear red sneakers, and their ability to leave home/family/jobs to go on this ""girls trip"". The characters are shallow and somehow always of one mind. I also think the author has her own personal homosexuality axe to grind which was a recurring theme in this unbelievable story."
3,Good Book Club read,This book was selected by a member of our book club. I was a bit skeptical at first as it looked like chic lit to me. The book isn't all that bad. I lost my mom this year so the bits about loss and grief hit home. The premise is a little far-fetched but I was willing to suspend belief for 300 pages and just go with the flow. I am looking forward to the group discussion next week. It should be lively.
3,Loved it for a little while...,"I really liked this book for about the first hundred pages. I felt very connected to the characters and loved the idea of a traveling funeral! Unfortunately, I think the book went on for too long and many of the messages were repeated over and over. This made it seem too forced. The idea was great, but fell short for me."
2,Definitely a woman's story.,"There were some very touching moments in this story,however after a while it was somewhat repetitive and predictable. Some elements of the story were not believable. The book was a fast somewhat mindless ""read""."
2,Great idea - that does not deliver.,The concept of this book seemed so promising. Unfortunately it wasn't very well done. I barely finished it. The authored tried much too hard to make every moment a bonding one - and life just isn't like that. Not worth reading.
2,One Long Hallmark Card,"""Overwrought"" really sums this book up. The author gets too caught up in describing every character's thoughts to the detriment of the plot."
2,Liked the idea...didn't like the book,"I picked up this book for two reasons. The first was the concept. Who wouldn't prefer a grand adventure to remember a loved one instead of a traditional funeral. Sounded like fun. The second reason was all the glowing reviews posted everywhere. I consider myself in the demographics marketed for this book; however, I couldn't finish it. The writing style is way too dramatic for me; too many metaphors and symbolisms. I could barely stomach the simplistic and unrealistic situations. I finally threw in the towel when the women are stranded in an airport terminal and their conversation regarding funerals is picked up by the entire terminal and everyone in it shares a funeral story...and then they all dance!"
1,SOUNDS fun...,... but it wasn't. Great concept for a book but this should have been a magazine article. My bookclub hated it (1/2 didn't even finish it). Was so over the top I wanted to scream. And too many grammatical errors (which drive me crazy). Really wanted to like this one but it was more frustrating than fun.
1,I feel vindicated,"A coworker of mine bought this book because she thought the cover art and back flap description looked promising. She lent it to me before she had read it and after 5 pages of Katherine mourning the loss of her favorite black bra, I was ready to give it back. I plodded along for about 60 or 70 pages and couldn't take it anymore. I didn't care for the author's flip flopping tense and I didn't have any compassion for these characters. This book is awful. I don't know what editor green lighted this book - but they need to be fired"
2,Boring,"When I first started into this book, I thought I was going to enjoy it. There were some very poignant moments. But, as the book progressed, along with the traveling funeral, I became bored with it and, in fact, did not finish the book. It became too sappy. A typical chick book, all flowers and happy moments and everyone loves everyone and the hero of the book, Annie, is loved by all. BORING!!"
4,Food For Thought,"This book is well-written and thought-provoking. While occasionally somewhat predictable, it's a wonderful treatise on women's friendships and the priorities in life."
1,Make it end!,"This book was highly recommended by a number of my book group members who were excited about re-reading it. I was really looking forward to the book. After the first couple of pages, I felt like it would never end.The characters are flat, and the dialogue is unrealistic. The story is devoid of plot or character development. NOTHING actually happens throughout the entire ""story"". Ugh! My friends told me that the book made them laugh and cry. I didn't laugh once...didn't even come close: just read over and over again about a group of women laughing and laughing. WHAT were they laughing about?? The book didn't make me cry either, except to cry out, ""Dear God, make it end!"" (Does that qualify as a religious experience?) Ms. Radish confuses meaningful with maudlin, and insight with inane when it comes to writing. After successfully forcing myself to finish the book, my next challenge is to come up with a tactful way to express myself at the next book group meeting."
2,Not so fabulous,"The reason I picked the book was the title. It sounded like a fun kind of story with a deep meaning intertwined. The backcover symopsis was intriguing also.I was bored after the first chapter. Too many 'flashbacks' and too much praising of Annie. She seemed unrealistic. I understand that she was a remarkable woman, we all know people like that but there was something that wasn't quite right.The notebook that the women write in was interesting twist but when they started to write from dead Annie's perspective, it was the last straw. Normally I would read a book within a few days but I just couldn't waste my time reading the end. It will speak to some women but I feel that you have to be a cancer survivor or know someone who has a terminal illness to 'get it.'"
1,Boring,I thought this was going to be a good read. I am half way through and I am considering putting it back on my shelf. It is more about teaching lifes lessons than a traveling funeral. It seems to me the author is repeating over and over. Annie is on too high a pedastel. It hasnt held my interest and Ive skipped lots of the lifes lessons. I have a hard time keeping whos who straight......alot of jargon. I cant understand how the other women can write journal entries of what Annie who is dead would say to them.
2,"Feminist/mushy, but some of the travelogue was fun","Picked this up on a whim, and almost didn't read the whole thing because I got bored with the ceaseless reflection on love between the various characters and the proclamations of how grand they all are individually. However, the accounts of the various geographic locations were fun to read - lush description of the NM desert, and the FL Keys. I also loved the hotel room in NY. I'm glad I finished it because the scene in the airport near the end was fantastic and rich, but had a hard time stomaching much of the rest of it."
3,Good til almost the end,"Enjoyed the first 3/4s of this book. The characters were easy to imagine as some of my friends, and their life stories were quite believeable. The idea of the traveling funeral was different and I enjoyed seeing what the pallbearers learned about Annie at each stop they made. As the funeral travels, the readers learn about Annie as well as the women attending her ashes. However, in the last 1/4 of the book, the scenario went way over the top and became totally unrealistic. The book seemed to lose it's direction, just as the traveling funeral did. I would have enjoyed the book much more, had it continued on the path of the funeral and revealing the personality of Annie as well as her pallbearers!"
1,Annie Freeman's Fabulous Traveling Funeral no fun,I thought the premise behind this book was great; but it just didn't deliver. The writing is so cliche and repetitious that I found it very difficult to finish this book. I won't read any more of Radish's books after reading this one.
1,"Read like an increbibly long, dull, detailed, book report on a good book","I ploughed through the entire thing, though I don't know why. The characters were flat and you couldn't tell them apart, the dialog was trite and mostly nonexistant and the plot was completely unconvincing without being interesting or fantastic in any way. The only redeeming thing about this book was that it focused on female friendship, a topic I generally like."
2,Annie Freeman's Fabulous Traveling Funeral,"This book was chosen by my monthly Book Club. It is light reading, not my fare, not much weight to storyline. I prefer non fiction, so if you prefer stronger stuff, make this book a pass."
4,A lovely way to deal with death.,"I am a guy. I like this book. I don't think the author is the best in the world and neither is this book. However, it is what it is. A lovely story of love, loss and living.So sad to see that many think that death is a dull or boring subject. I suppose to most of us Americans that this can be a sad subject but it shouldn't be. That is what this book is about. It is about thinking differently and acting outside the ""BOX"". I know that is a concept that scares most folks.I loved the way the author wrote about things as mundane as a bra but still made it so important and interesting.I was hooked (pardon the pun) after the first chapter and I needed the help these gals celebrate a life that was too short.It was entertaining and an escape from reality for a few fleeting moments. We should all have that in our lives more.I recommend this book!!!"
5,Truly Touching!,I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The story line was great and you really get a feel for the characters in the book. The idea of a traveling funeral was unique and the affect it had on everyone it touched was amazing. The only part I was disappointed in was the last stop they made. I felt it was too short and non-descript. I sent this book to a close friend of mine and she loved it!!!!
3,Spiritual connection,"After her death, it's Annie Freeman's wish to have her friends meet each other and go on a trip together. They all have Annie's spiritual connection to share among themselves. Cute story."
4,A Wonderful Tale,"What a great story of friendship, love and loss. The message is clear that you need to have FUN in this life as you only go around once. I didn't care for the reference towards the end of the Authors political views but overall a GREAT read."
2,Annie Freeman's Fabulous Traveling Funeral,"I liked the first half of this book, setting up the premise and introducing the characters. After the first stop on the travelling funeral, however, it became repetitive and just too much of a good thing. Every place was fabulous, awesome and beautiful in its own way, too many coincidences, and Annie was too much of a saint to be believable. It seemed that each new stop outdid the others until the ending was way over the top! Linda"
3,Annie Freemand traveling funeral,"I'm still reading it. Can't seem to hold my interest. It was suggested by a friend, but it isn't the type of book I would normally have purchased."
2,sentimental in the extreme,"I am reading this book for book club, and would not have chosen it myself otherwise. This concept is SENTIMENTAL in the EXTREME! Now, sentimental is not necessarily a bad thing. I cry at billboards. But I dislike the ""we women own all of the emotions of the world"" mentality of a novel like this. I find myself kind of ticked off at Annie for dragging us through one tediously overblown scenario after another. In the first third of the book I have already had to read about terminal cancer, suicide, single parenting, and stalking. What joys remain for me to enjoy? Oh, how about throwing cremated ashes around out of an old tennis shoe! The ""sisterhood"" makes it all worthwhile and do-able? Wine and conversation are a panacea? This COULD be funny, but instead it's just tragic and contrived."
2,"condition of book fine, substance light","It took longer than I expected to receive this product, although within time estimates given. Condition of book was fine for a used book, although the substance was mush. I wouldn't recommend reading it."
2,Traveling Funeral a little too long,"After reading the first third of this book, I recommended it to a friend, but by the time I finished the book I was more than ready for Annie's journey to be over. The premise of the book is great and the life lessons important, but they are repeated so many times, the reader feels like she has to duck.The first half of the book is fun to read and a grand adventure, but I think I need to call my friend and modify my recommendtion."
1,glad to see so many others agree,"i was intrigued by the premise, but had to fight my way to the end..i was so sick of the repetition & the characters' self-congratulatory ""oh we're so wonderful, we're such fabulous women, let's toot our own horns for another hundred pages"" routine that i really had a hard time even finishing it. i probably wouldn't have, if it hadn't been lent to me by someone i value & i wanted to give it a fair chance. i skimmed most of the last half & when i was done i said to my husband ""FINALLY i'm done with this thing!"""
1,I want my hours back,"This book was very disappointing. I had to force myself to finish it. The repetition begins on the third page and then beats us over the head until the end. Why a book celebrating women and their friendships has to bash men is beyond me. In writing a book contemplating death, Radish never once considers faith. Her characters are all carbon copies of one another, and the story which is supposedly about great transformations teaches us nothing except that a vacation refreshes us. Duh! Don't spend your vacation, or any of your valuable time on this one."
3,A good airplane read,"This is a light, rather exaggerated tale with many unlikely coincidences. I only read this because it was recommended by a fellow book club member as one for us to discuss and really felt it was a waste of time. Not much substance to it but anyone who's looking for the literary equivalent of chewing gum may find it enjoyable. The slight swearing wasn't that off-putting and seemed to be appropriate to the context. I would put it in the category of fantasy fiction."
1,Contrived and poorly written,"I read this for book club, and found it unbearable. It was like reading an entire book written by my worst college freshman writing student who sailed through high school English with straight As then though she could win me over with excessive prose and contrived emotion. With few exceptions, the entire thing was drivel, though I confess I skipped a multitude of sentences and sometimes entire passages as the trial wore on. I like the premise and Radish falls upon some worthy insights, but she has no business being published. She does not possess the requisite skills."
2,Disappointed,This book was a choice of my book club because we were misinformed that the book was humorous and light. The cover gives this impression also. But the content proved otherwise. It was too sappy and unrealistic for my tastes.
3,Disappoiting Ending,"I enjoyed most of this book but I could barely get through the last 50 pages. In fact, it got so boring I found myself skimming over the words. I felt like I was reading the same thing over and over again. I also felt some aspects of the book were totally unrealistic. I found it hard to believe that not one of Annie's best friends knew she had been briefly married or that she visited her family lodge in the northwest for two weeks every year.I did enjoy the different personalities and shed a few tears through the first half of the book."
5,The funniest funeral book ever,"I loved this book and can't believe I had not heard of Kris radish before. A friend mailed me a copy because of my own end-of-life interests. But this was a whole new take. Such laughter, so many tears, such adventure, so much to think about regarding the people we love, and the importance of letting them know we love them now. I hope reading this book leads to many creative ways of honoring those we lose. And most important is Radish's message to live life fully and joyfully now. What could be a better gift from a well-written novel?!Laura Larsen RN, author of Facing the Final Mystery: A Guide to Discussing End-of-Life Issues"
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought this book at Costco hoping for a great beach read. I kept hoping this book would get better and finally got so annoyed, I put it down for good about 2/3 of the way through (although I read the epilogue to make sure I didn't miss anything and it was all wrapped up way too neatly for me). It took so many turns and was so unrealistic with a bit too much liberalism thrown in. The idea of the book is fantastic but the writer tries way to hard to make this book memorable and symbolic."
3,Should I read this or not??,"Well, here's a ""review"" from someone who has NOT read this book yet, but checked amazon reviews before buying it. A friend highly recommended it at a recent college reunion, but I always ""check"" books out first. The reviews here on Amazon are so far apart that it's actually kind of funny. People either love or can't stand this book! There isn't a whole lot in between. I guess I'll have to get it and see what happens. It sounds as if I'll fall into one camp or the other very soon into it...."
2,"""Show me, don't tell me""","I actually recommended this book to my book group after both my sister and cousin-in-law raved that it was a must read. I'm sorry girls. If I hadn't felt I should read the whole thing, I would have skimmed over all the repititions of too many tears, too much whine, as well as too much wine. The author never showed me how Annnie was ""fabulous"". Same old, same old Kris Radish; if you like her themes, you will enjoy this book, if not you will be bored enough to be planning your own funeral."
4,Love it or Hate it?,"I'm reading this book along with a couple other online friends. It's definately for women only but I think also, for a subset of women; the older, successful professionals who had a hard time as teens/young adults. You have to be post-menopause or close to it to know these women and for their feelings and the ""repetition"" to make sense. The other two women I'm reading along with are younger than I am, so from what I've read here at Amazon, I'm now curious to see if they will like the book. Annie Freeman was 56; you probably aren't going to understand this book if you're 39 or 67 (presumably if you're 67 you will have moved on past this stage of life)."
1,Drivel,"I normally finish every book I start but I could not finish this one. It seemed the first 100 pages were about a bra! OK, so I exaggerate but really, this was tedious, over the top, ""oh how sensitive women are"" and ""oh how we love to bond."" It was a good premise but the execution was so sappy it made my teeth hurt. YUCK."
1,Patronizing,"This book is quite tedious and patronizing. Kris Radish apparently doesn't believe her audience is smart enough to understand/glean the emotions of the characters. She writes ""dribbling"" words of what they think instead of creating full characters whose nuances, actions, and unique dialogues speak for themselves. I can't relate to one single character, and think it's quite odd that all of them use the same language and seem to have no true individuality. And, on top of that, Marie's intuition and Laura's extra-sensory perception abilities seemed completely unbelievable and goofy in this story."
4,Almost perfect...just too much of it...,"This book is fantastic...until the last third - because it's basically a repeat of the second third of the book. It just goes on too long. If there were to be that many stops and people to get through, the lessons and stories of each need to be more unique and different. It started to take away from the power and importance of the initial message and make it sappy and overdone, a real shame because I think the author is really onto something great here. Still very much worth a read, just skim like heck the last bit of it and it won't be so bad."
1,Radish Irks,"This may be the worst book I've ever tried to read. Hyperbolic, sentimental, and contrived. All characters speak with the same (unnatural) voice. I may divorce my Book Club for mental cruelty."
2,Underwhelmed,"Two minutes into the audio, I already disliked this title so much that I wanted to push the stop button. I stuck it out only because of a friend's high recommendation for the print version. And it was a struggle not to give up on the book. I just did not identify with, nor really like, any of the characters. Maybe too homespun for me, or too... what? I don't know; it was not the book for me. Two stars because the premise of a traveling funeral is interesting."
5,Never gets old,"If you think you already know your family and friends, think again! I found myself not only getting to know them better but myself as well."
2,Does an OK job but there has got to be something better!,"I have been using this book for almost 2 months to teach myself Flash programming. I do think the book is very good at making things simple and easy to understand but sometimes it's ""too easy."" I think those that are learning flash programming are already going to have some experience with using computers, so some of the stuff that this book explains is unnecessary. Also, there are no source files so sometimes I would like to follow the directions in the book to do something but I don't have any basic source files to do any of the things the book describes...so I think this book is only good for introducing the program. I need to get another book that actually has a more ""recipe"" like structure so that I can follow along and do as the book instructs but with source files."
4,"Great, but get the import instead!",An excellent score for an excellent film -but I prefer the UK import which includes the soundtrack as well as the score. It's worth the extra money.
3,Not filled with 80's music,"I got this thinking that I would hear all the songs in the movie, and you only get that one at the end, mad world, and the rest is classical, which is alright, but be warned that is what you are getting."
2,Mostly Musical,I did not realize that it was all musical except for the song I bought it for. I should have bought the CD by the artist instead of the soundtrack.Debra cox
3,Why only 3 stars? Because...,The creepy them that played during the house burning/movie theatre scene is NOT on this CD. That happened to be my favorite theme in the film. omitting that cost these bozos a full two stars. What on earth were they thinking?
1,Read the reviews before you buy,"I wish I'd have read some of the reviews of the ""Donny Darko"" score before purchasing the recording. The music that inspired me to buy the album simply isn't on the disc--a point many of the reviewers make clear. What's on the disc is a lot of short, repetitious mood tracks that work well as background music for the film but don't hold up in an audio-only format. Frankly, I was angered by this deceptive recording. Maybe someday the actual soundtrack will be made available. This sure isn't it."
1,oof... horrible,Apparently they were too cheap to actually pay for any of the MUSIC in the movie so this soundtrack is actually just a compilation of sounds and audio effects... completely useless.
4,Great mode piece with only 41 minutes of music,"I realized that many of the 80's songs played during the movie were not included on this CD before buying it. I find that many movie soundtracks these days are missing about half of the songs played during the movie yet the CD only has about 40 minutes of music on them leaving about 1/2 the CD's capacity completely empty. Why not fill the entire 80 minutes of the CD. I believe this is because the movie producers do not take the time and extra money to secure the rights to distribute the music on CD. They save money and the consumer gets less, I thinks it's a ripoff. I simply look very close at the list of songs before buying movie soundtracks but am disappointed that this appears to happen very often."
2,"just wanted ""mad world""","loved the mad world track from the Gears of War video game. was hoping the rest of the album was as cool, but it is all instrumentals. a little disappointing, i must admit."
2,Liked only one cut,"I bought this CD for the song ""Mad World"". Unfortunately it was the only one I liked, but I've spent more money on dumber things."
1,Donnie Darko score CD (not a soundtrack),I'd ordered this hopeing it was the soundtrack but instead got a bunch of instrumental music with two versions of MAD WORLD that are worthwhile.... but wheres the rest of the great music from the film?not reccomendedjust buy a single of mad world and Echo & the Bunnyman records instead.
5,"those looking for the movie's score, you're in luck!","Pop Music from Donnie Darko (in order of appearance):01. ""The Killing Moon"" - Echo & The Bunnymen02. ""Head over Heels"" - Tears For Fears03. ""Notorious"" - Duran Duran04. ""Proud To Be Loud"" - The Dead Green Mummies05. ""Love Will Tear Us Apart"" - Joy Division06. ""Under the Milky Way"" - The Church07. ""Mad World"" - Gary Jules"
3,Enjoyable. Moody. Too Short.,"This soundtrack in enjoyable. It complements the soundtrack of a very interesting and enjoyable movie. Much like the movie, the soundtrack projectsis a feeling of disconnected reality and an almost untouchable angst that stems from the heavily vocoded melodies and harmonies. I purchased this disc thinking that the pieces of music would be longer than the 30 second samples found on Amazon, however most of the tracks are fewer than two minutes long, and many are under a minute. All of the tracks on this disc are interesting, however highlights include Rosie Darko and Gretchen Ross. For the few seconds that the songs play, they are dreamy, moody, and perfect for either spacing out while surfing the net, or for falling asleep at night."
5,"Haunting, Original, Disturbing","This is the most inspiring dark soundtrack I have ever heard.If Michael Andrews would have been around when Stanley Kubrick, you can bet your arse Kubrick would have taken him on board for any movie.Imagine The Shinning, but for modern (even futuristic) times.Very simplistic, yet it attacks all your senses at once, leaving no one indifferent.This is a masterpiece."
5,"INTERESTING, BEAUTIFUL SCORE; NICE FOR MEDITATION","wonderful score! in a class by itself. my best description: classical, sometimes operatic, music meets modern day electronics including soft, mellow compositions intertwined w/ playful up-beat, mind-bending rifts. excellent for meditation or simply relaxing. the only song w/ lyrics, 'Mad World,' is a gloomy reality check on life but is another wonderful song w/ a lovely musical score & sad but poetic lyrics. Most will recognize Adam Lambert's (American Idol) version of this beautiful song. a definite RECOMMENDATION!"
4,not what i thought it was gonna be,from just seeing the title i thought it was a elvis-bashing book but i read it and it was VERY MUCH funny and still respectful and tasteful. i thought it was gonna make fun of elvis but it was just a bunch of funny stories and trivia and stuff without being mean or rude or anything. i really recommend it if you like elvis.
1,slapped together - VERY short,"39 minutes for 6 segments. once you figure in transitions that is 5 minutes per segment. And the segments are pretty thin. A bit of info on substitutions. The tabs book is VERY thin and very little of the video is transcribed. Try Jimmy Bruno's No Nonsense Jazz Guitar it has a fat tabs book, is way longer, and it fits together instead of just throwing parts of several videos together like this piece of trash.Over all a RIP OFF"
1,Total waste of time,"I was looking forward to this movie, as my husband and I love films with werewolves, vampires, zombies...etc. Neither of us had ever read the books, so we didn't know much about the story line. It was truly one of the worst movies I have ever suffered through. We saw it in the theater, and we almost walked out about halfway through, but decided to stick it out to the bitter end. It's worse than a soap opera...there's nothing wrong with a little romance in a horror film, but this was just insipid."
1,Short & Sweet,I'm going to sum this up in a few sentences or less. If you have read the book by Annette Kurtis Klause and thought it was a fantastic read despite the fact that it is a young adult's book then I would strongly advise against seeing this movie. The story line pretty much went against everything that was in the book. Not to mention the fact that the special effects weren't all that great either. I loved the book and point blank period the movie was god awful. I wanted to cry within the first five minutes because it was just that bad. I guess that Ms. Klause cared more about what money could be made from the movie than the actual quality of the finished product.
1,Stop turning books into movies if you are going to change EVERYTHING!,"This is an awful movie if you have read the book and love it. I read the book long before this movie came out and fell in love with it. Anyone read Eragon then watch Eragon the movie? This is worse.The book is great, the storyline gets you hooked and the ending is an unexpected one but also great unlike the predictable storyline in the movie. Apart from the characters having the same name and the fact that it's about werewolves nothing in the book and the movie are the same. The setting, the ages of the characters, the appearances of the characters, there is no actual chocolate in the book it is just a metaphor not a place where she works like in the movie, the storyline everything in the book is different and 100 times better. I hate this movie out of pure spite, they shouldn't have even bothered. This makes me not want to see movies based on books. I don't recommend this movie. Read the book. Annette Curtis Klause wrote it."
1,waste of time and money,"If you read the book, don't watch the movie. It was very disappointing. I think the movie was probably only ""inspired"" by the book. Character names the same but different storyline, different location, different ending. I loved the book, wish the movie was more like it."
4,visually beautiful,"i liked the movie when i saw it the second time. the scenery is beautiful. if you read the book,try to think of this as an entirely different story . the book and characters similar feelings to canines would have been hard to show on the screen."
3,Blood and Chocolate,"Why, I'm wondering, do people have to ruin books? I LOVED this book, and I saw that it was being made into a movie, and I was really excited. And I knew it would be different from the book, just because of the trailer, but I was still looking forward to it. And now I watched it, and it's definitely not what I expected. It was just too different, and if I hadn't loved the book then I never would have even liked the movie."
2,Disappointing,I think they were riding their wave from Underworld which I really enjoyed. Some of the special effects were good but there just wasn't much story and not much substance to what story there was. I would rather have a sequel to Underworld....anyone else?
1,Doesn't hold up to the book,"I read the book when it came out years ago, but read it again for the sake of the movie. I had a feeling the movie wasn't going to live up to it just from the trailers, so I waited this long, til it was on TV, to watch it.This story was soo childish it was sad. The was the ""rules"" worked pretty much screwed them from the beginning. One man shouldn't be allowed to have all the power over soo many people. He especially shouldn't be allowed to ""have"" someone that doesn't even want him. What I kept waiting for was for Vivian to actually defy Gabriel, tell him she wouldn't lay with him even if he forced her to be his mate. But she stayed soo nervous, for no good reason. And why did all those werewolves follow him anyway? I mean if Gabriel wasn't soo intent on having things his way, none of the fighting would have happened.All in all, it felt like a waste of time."
2,boring,"I tried to like this movie because am a fan of vampires movies and I like the whole thing of transforming in to wolves, but this movie is very bad, the acting is terrible."
3,Blood and Chocolate,"Vivian's decision to run against the pack places her new boyfriend in mortal danger in BLOOD AND CHOCOLATE, adapted from the popular teen novel by Annette Curtis Klause. This pre-TWILIGHT romantic Horror film finds trouble balancing the two genres, and often delivers more unintentional humor than terror or suspense while forging several regretful similarities to AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN PARIS. The unconvincing cast causes the film to fall flat on more than one occasion, especially throughout the passionless performances by the two young lovers. In the rush to introduce the players and establish the growing conflict within the pack, director Katja von Garnier neglects to develop any form of rapport between Agnes Bruckner and Hugh Dancy, and even less of an emotional connection between the characters and the audience. What we are left with is a Horror movie without any scares, and a Romance that is rife with cliches, but lacking in true love.-Carl ManesI Like Horror Movies"
1,well.....,I've seen the trailer for this film and I'm not sure it will hold up to the book. If it does turn out like the book I think it will be awesome and I'm looking forward to seeing it. I recommend the book to anyone who likes werewolves!
1,Garbage,"Compared to the book, this movie is GARBAGE!!! It doesn't even follow the book, they just add the names of the characters. Viv doesn't work in some pastry shop, she goes to high school. Aiden doesn't choose her, she ends up with a member of the pack... this movie is so far from what it should have been I cannot believe that it was allowed to be released like this."
1,Eli Writes Review,"Only reason this movie would ever get above 1 star rating is if you have never ever read the book or intend to.This is perfect example of how to butcher a good story and have someone make 'creative changes' that just don't work. This is the example I base all terrible versions of movies based on books on. Worse movie based on a book ever! Someone pretty much went ""Oh hey that sounds cool, let's take the idea and change everything.""The setting (not even in the right country), the ages, the entire story to the point of ENDING differently. The ONLY thing the same is the characters names, the characters themselves are completely unrecognizable.Blood and Chocolate is one of my favourite books. I didn't see this movie until years after it came out and I'm so happy I didn't. This movie is bad, I mean it puts bad movies to shame. Down-right don't waste your time. If you're a fan of the book I'm sure you would have heard of it by now, and if you haven't: There is a reason for that!"
2,"filmed like eyecandy, but not the book","having read and loved the book this was a complete and utter disappointment. The book being about a 16 year old girl coming of age and learning her feminine prowess, a process all girls go through if they are human or werewolf. This movie became the typical Hollywood girl meets boy story. finding myself so dismayed in the typical boring movie I have actually put it up for sale at amazon. I can say it was filmed with visual integrity, and my husband having not read the book was midily entertained."
1,Blood and Chocolate,"Blood & Chocolate [Region 99]This movie sucked. If you read the book, please save yourself the trauma of watching this!!! The only thing that it did have from the book was the title and the names of characters. It truly traumatized me. My friend said that I sat for 2 1/2 hours saying ""what the hell happened? They had the book...what the hell happened?"" Needless to say I liked the book and wish I had saved the $9 it cost to watch it in theatre. I should have asked for my money back, but I was too traumatized to think straight."
2,A Paranormal Flop,"I was really excited about seeing this movie when I heard what it was about. I was expecting something fantastic because the plot sounded really good and creative. However, when I finally got to see the movie I was extremely disappointed in the quality of the production. I think the only thing I really enjoyed was the detail displayed in the gothic like scenery and I didn't think they did that bad of a job turning humans into wolves. Although, with all of the technological advances of the day, I think they could have had something more impressive. Overall, I don't think this movie is worth owning and it disappointed me."
1,bleeeh,"my fond memory of the blood and chocolate of 1997 ruined any possible enjoyment i could have had for the sham blockbuster of 2007. seriously, there was very very little relation between the book and movie which was disappointing; that was the only reason i was interested in seeing the movie. the whole purpose of the original story, i was shocked by the loss of everything. the actors were really badly chosen, the script was bleeh, and .. basically a thoroughly disappointing movie"
1,"About as ""based"" on the book as the Eragon movie was...","For those of you that have read the wonderful novel this movie was 'based' on, the only advice i can give you is dont see it. I couldnt even bring myself to watch the whole movie- halfway through i turned it off. The acting is really not up to par, the 'bad guy' seems about as menacing as a wet kitten, and worst of all the only thing the movie shares in common with the book are character names, and thats about it. Hollywood slaughtered the novel in every way shape and form. I havent been this disappointed in a book turned movie since the Eragon movie came out.For those of you that havent read the book, this might be a decent movie, albeit seriously corny (her working in a chocolate shop?? C'mon, there had to be SOMETHING more creative there for the blood and chocolate theme)."
2,"Way, Way Off","I usually try to appreciate films based on books for their own merits. This film is visually appealing, but as I absolutely love the original story, I truly cannot overcome my horror at how badly the story was butchered to make this into a film. I don't even know WHY it was butchered so badly, as it certainly doesn't improve the story, which was fine as it was. Agnes Bruckner is good in the role of Vivian, as are the actors who portray the Five; aside from Rafe's penchant for the occasional murder in the film, these six characters maintain their essence in the adaptation, though no other character does. In the novel Gabriel is sexy, strong, and cool, not hateful and perverted. He is not Rafe's father, and he does not switch mates every seven years.Anyway, I was terribly disappointed with this film because I believe a film based more on the original novel would have been MUCH, MUCH better."
2,Pretty Far Off,"This movie was very disappointing. I read the book before watching it and I was very excited to see how they but the story into film but this movie was a complete let down. Although it features the same characters, the movie entirely twisted the original story, killing off the wrong characters, taking place in the wrong locations, and even featuring the wrong conflicts. While in the book the title blood and chocolate reffers to the main character's internal conflict between being part of a pack and falling in love with a human, the movie uses it to refer to her job at a chocolate shop, hardly showing any of her interal struggle. And this is only one of the many key points of the story that was changed.I guess this would be an okay movie if you haven't read the book, but even then I feel it lacking an interesting plot, or even characters that have good chemistry.In my opinion, an overall disappointment."
4,I enjoyed the movie,I wouldn't call this movie a horror film classic but I did enjoy it for what it was. It had an interesting concept and the characters were well established and acted. I even found the way the humans morphed into wolves as interesting and different than other movies.As a horror movie it lacked much substance but it was interesting in its own right.
5,Best Movie Ever-,"Blood & Chocolate is a fabulous movie, deep, and interesting. Quality great, its regeon 1 though, so you'll need a region free dvd player, or region 1 dvd player."
1,Fans of the novel lament! This movie was horrible!,"If you've read the novel, DO NOT watch this movie. If you haven't read the book, read the book and then DO NOT watch this movie! The big wigs in Hollywood pretty much threw out anything that resembled the book, kept the character names, then regurgitated a werewolf-centered 'Underworld' remake for movie-goers."
3,It's not all bad,"If you haven't read the book, the movie is worth seeing. I hadn't read the book for many years when this movie came out, so I figured it was worth a shot to watch it. The movie is cute, but ultimately, if you've read the book, you'll be highly disappointed. The story is mostly rewritten and the ending is completely different, which really spoils the message the book was trying to get through about the main character finding that what she needs having been right there all along. Watch is as a new story; don't compare it to the book."
3,MORE FANTASY-LOVE STORY THAN HORROR,"This is not as bad a movie as some have claimed ( though it hardly compares to AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON, or even THE HOWLING ). It is a bit sappy at times, and occasionally devolves into soap opera, but on the whole, the acting is decent, the camera work is atmospheric enough, and the story could be much worse. The transformation scenes are about the least convincing aspect of the film, but the two hunt scenes are fun. There is also, unfortunately, very little horror in BLOOD & CHOCOLATE."
2,Blood and Chocolate the movie vs book,"I watched the movie, then read the book, then watched the movie again. There is so little in common between the book (excellent) and the movie (poor) that I will put that movie on the back shelf. The movie was good for what they did, but it was an injustice to call it Blood and Chocolate. If you have not read the book, then the movie is easier to watch and enjoy. The book was awesome, in the book, Gabriel is wanting a mate-Vivian, he does not seem to be replacing an existing one. Astrid is not at all the same as she is in the book. In the book Vivian accepts her duality and finally finds the love she craved within her pack. I too wanted to see the fight for dominance with both the male and female wolves. Too much taken from the book to make this movie. Age differences, location differences, social dilemma's lost, characters left out or completely changed."
5,love this movie,The supernatural has always appealed to me and I found this movie a long time ago but it was stolen so I replaced it.
2,Blood & Chocolate,Did not like this movie at all. The story did not make any sense. There was more blood than chocolate.
1,Not Happy,I did not like the movie because I have the book and I think the movie was a total waste of time if they just placed the movie in a different country and changed all the characters and their purpose in the book. I would not recommend this movie to anyone
2,Read the book - want to see the movie?,"After reading the book (which by the way was quite good), discovered the movie version, while I was a bit unsure (the synopsis for the movie seemed that it was a bit of a departure from the book), I thought, why not give it a go, unfortunately except for the fact the female lead in both the book & movie have the same name & turn into a werewolf, and the other characters have the same names, it was so loosely based on the book, as to be almost non-existant. As werewolf movies go its a tad lame, but kinda OK, but if you liked the book & hope to see the movie expecting the same, basically don't bother."
1,A BIG dissapointment,"I read the book and really liked it. However,the movie is compeltely different. BASED on the book yes.. however, it is a bad movie. I didn't like any part of it. The casting was very odd and so was the setting."
4,"Blood and chocolate, quite the mix","I have not read the book although I could imagine many things were changed.However, from the point that I have not read the book I can not make comparisons. I found this movie to be very good and entertaing. When they were being chased I was on the edge of my seat. Not the best movie out there but still pretty good, worth watching."
2,Excessive in all aspects,"Perhaps the goal of this novel is too grandiose, and that is why Wolff fails so obviously. Wolff tries to present each unique reader with a character that they can relate to, and instead ends up with a gang of stereotypes. He tries to show a family grappling with its problems, but the situations are so ridiculous that the book becomes a soap-opera-like melodrama. To some extent, this novel seems to be a bildungsroman, chronicling the growth of a boy into manhood. However, the childhood protagonist is hardly reconcilable to the adult, and the reader has trouble sympathizing with either. To see a family in crisis dissected more accurately, see Judith Guest's ORDINARY PEOPLE."
3,Highly overrated tale of a boy's quest for understanding.,"Although Wolff does exhibit some facility with language, thetone and point of view are not consistent; not only that, hisslumming into people's private lives, ala Updike, is finallyunpleasant and at times stomach-churning."
4,Delightful 'chick' lit,"Eugenie write a fictional account of a young woman in the business of selling women's intimate apparel. In addition to an interesting account of the workings of a retail business, and a love story, it tells of her succumbing to lupus. I would have liked more emphasis in ads and library of congress cataloging on the lupus aspect."
2,Hard to keep reading,"I normally do not write reviews, but thought that I should with this novel. The pace was very slow, the characters unlikeable, and ultimately the story line predictible. I will not read any more titles from this author."
5,CD Purchase,This product came before I expected and it was really what I was looking for. It was to my satisfaction...I look forward to doing business with you in the future.
1,no support for this game,"first there is no support for this game.It isnt windows xp compadible ,and there is no down loadable patch for windows xp .buy driver a really good game concidering its age nice cars and over all fun game ."
3,Original sources from 1898 - 1928,"This is not a history book but a collection of ""original sources."" Ranging from The White Man's Burden to a President Taft speech to The Saturday Evening Post, this book republishes then-current speeches, articles, reports, and other literature. Good for studying American history without another author's editing and viewpoint, this series of books (this being volume 6) presents what people said in their own words at the time."
2,REXX book,"This book has very poor standards. As soon as I open the book to read, I didn't like it at all. This is good one for COBOL programers, who wants to learn Clist or REXX.I intendent to learn Clist and REXX."
4,Inspiration and Encouraging!,"I Bought this CD yesterday. Oh How it encourages my heart and inspires me. The words are uplifting and helpful on a day to day basis. I encourage especially anyone who has gotten the last Katina cd to get this one too-you'll love it. And for those who aren't quite sure wether to get this cd I tell you, you won't regret buying this one!! Enjoy"
5,Extra fun with lights & sounds!,"I got this along with several other GI Joe figures for my 3 boys (ages 10, 8, and 4). All of the Sigma Strike figure are fun, with the case doubling as a storage box for their accessories. This one, however, has to be the best of the bunch because of the interchangable weapon that includes lights & sounds. If you can get this one at the clearance price, I'd do so, because you won't find a better deal ANYWHERE!One side note: I agree that caution should be used with younger children because of the projectiles the weapons shoot. We usually confiscate all projectiles from this type of toy to avoid any problems (either a kid getting hurt, pieces getting lost, or a pet eating one).Also, I gave it 2 stars for educational value since it's not really a ""learning"" toy...just a FUN one."
5,TESTAMENT RULES!!!!,"PRACTICE WHAT YOU PREACH is a TOTAL THRASH MASTERPIECE!!!!! It's more polished than their first 2 THRASH MASTERPIECES, THE LEGACY and THE NEW ORDER, but show TESTAMENT in their peak!!!! The title track, PERILOUS NATION, BLESSED IN CONTEMPT, SINS OF OMISSION, ENVY LIFE and TIME IS COMING are THRASH GENS!!!!REALLY GREAT!!! WELL DONE, TESTAMENT!!!!! TESTAMENT RULES!!!!!!"
5,"Heavy, Amazing, Thrashy, What More Can I Say","This has to be one of the best thrash albums of all time.I think that this is testaments best album yet. Even though all of there stuff is great. If you are a fan of thrash and you find this in your local record store I would pick this up FOR SURE. Every track rocks, but I thank the tital track is the best. Pick it up you will love it."
3,where's the punch ?,"i rememer reading a review on this album back when it came out (the things i remember)that said it was recorded live in studio.so for all these years i assumed this was the culprit behind this albums lack of umph (is that a word?).before writing this review i was reading some others where the lack punch was mentioned.so before i blew the lid off this mystery i wanted to check w/my ""practice what ..""cd foldout ,to substantiate the claim . it says nothing of it .so i don't know where the hell the punch went.i would've given this 5 srars if it was a live in studio album ,this changes everything!"
3,A little too technical for my tastes,"There is some fine material on this album, like ""Sins Of Omission,"" but I don't feel that it has the same punch as earlier albums. The leads are still wonderful though."
2,I Didn't Order This Its A Nice Album,"I Didn't Order This. At Least I Haven't Receive It Yet.It's A Nice Album, I like it alot.I don't know why they have it on this page i'm revewing what I purchased. 'I Didn't Purchase It Yet, Or They Haven't Sent It To Me Yet.It is A good album, I corently Have it on casset tape, I wouldn't mind it on CD but I've hadn't ordered it yet."
4,faster than the speed of light!!,"yet painfully aweswome the title track is an awesome song. yeah, these guys are influenced by metalica, but they carried on a traditon better thanmetalica and it shows through. i think all their albums up until their horrible attempt at death metal were good. thrash lives through this album. all the songs are great why not get it?"
5,EXCELLENT!!,This is a must-own album. It's the real deal if you have you [price] this is the disc to buy!!
4,A must have for fans of Testament,"If you are a huge fan of Testament, like me...you will love it. Fans of hard-core metal...you won't be disappointed. People who listen to mainstream pop music...go away! This is not for you!"
5,Great!,"Although slower than their previous two albums, and fairly simplistic drumming, this is a great addition to one's collection.Just read all the reviewers that gave this 4-5 stars and trust their words. I guarantee you'll be glad you did."
3,"good band, good songs, not such a great recording","Testament is a very talented band, and while I think the songs on this recording are great, it does have some major flaws. The recording sounds very flat, which robs this band of much of it's energy. There's very little variance in dynamic, and the mix lacks richness. Unfortunately a lot of metal bands don't exactly have great production.Still the songs on this CD are quite good, I am especially fond of The Ballad."
5,Ten tracks of shreadin' fun!,"Thats the truth. from track 1 to track 10 the cd rocks all the way through. But the songs dont sound the same though. Practice what you preach is one album any metalhead should have. The first song which is the title song is probably the best on the cd. Envy Life and Time is Coming are good too. In fact evey song on the cd is good. Confusion Fusion, the last track, is an instrumental song which kinda has a freaky waltz sound to it in some parts. Even if you think the album is just ""ok"" when you first get it, keep it. It grows on ya!"
5,**Testament's Best!**,This is where the band truly started to come into their own. No outside interference. The CD is outstanding through and through.
4,A Thrash Classic!!,"What can you say but Testament Rulz!! This cd is a Thrash masterpiece. ""The Ballad"" is one of their better slow songs ever recorded. It picks up in the end. Practice what you preach is a solid cd and only second to ""The New Order"". If you like Thrash and don't have this cd you're missing out!"
2,puppygurl,THIS HAS 2 STOP! BRATZ FANS STOP SAYING MYSCENE SUCK AND MYSCENE FANS STOP SAYING BRATZ SUCK! THERE IS NOTHING WRONG ABOUT 2 DOLLS!!THERE BOTH REALLY GREAT DOLLS!
5,You said it,"Whatever your name is, you are so right. This doll is better then those lame dopey ugly My Scene dolls. My Scene dolls suck and Bratz dolls rule. This doll is gorgeous. I want her, and Cloe and Sasha and Yasmin. They are all so pretty."
1,COPY OF MY SCENE,"I DON'T CARE WHICH ONE YOU THINK IS BETTER, IT MATTERS THAT THESE DOLLS COPIED OFF OF THE MY SCENE CLUB BIRTHDAY ONES THAT CAME FIRST. IF YOU WANT TO HEAR MORE ABOUT THIS, PLEASE LOOK ON BRATZ BIRTHDAY BASH SASHA'S PAGE."
5,Dana H.,"hey i agree with you, Dana. My scene DOES suck! And Bratz rule! i love the bratz twiins. Its so cool cuz my twin and i play with them all of the time and i like Pheobe and she likes Roxxi.
