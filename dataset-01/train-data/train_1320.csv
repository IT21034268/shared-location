5,MOVIE,PURCHASED THIS AS A GIFT FOR A FRIEND THAT LOVES OLDER WESTERN MOVIES HE IS ALSO A BIG DUKE FAN
4,You have to be a fan!,"We got this collection for my father-n-law's birthday. He loves the ""Duke"" and so we knew we couldn't go wrong. We also picked up a DVD player at the same time. He is sitting in his recliner enjoying them now! Some of the footage is quite dated but, hey, my dad doesn't mind and neither will yours. If you have a John Wayne fan in your life this will be a treat for them."
3,What films are in this collection?,"I don't see any list of films for this collection. They are probably ""oaters"" (low budget westerns) he did in the 30's, but we won't know from this site. How about a list, Amazon?"
2,Good old movie But could have been better,"I do have this DVD Collect, bought from Wal-mart bad thing to do on my behalf because I buy my DVD'S from AMAZON, The price was much higher then Amazon, Amazon has good decient prices, at the time I seen it at Wal-mart wasn't thinking because though the price was great!! NOT!! Buy from AMAZON better prices, better products, Fair and good people you deal with at AMAZON. Won't happen again price wasn't good as I thought it was and the movie NOT!!So much worth the money I spent and to top it off I had .to pay Taxes not with AMAZON in most and many states"
5,Writing ranks up there with McMurtry,"As a male reader, I always come away from reading one of Jo-Ann Mapson's books better understanding how women think and feel about love, relationships and....men. In The Wilder Sisters, I particularly enjoyed the family dynamics of Rose and Lily's parents, who operate a horse ranch in Floralee, New Mexico. While there is no actual town of Floralee on the map, I found clues that made me believe we were in Taos--Michael's Restaurant, Sage Bakery, etc. Mapson's strength in painting locales and developing characters is strong and convincing. She doesn't shy away from examining human imperfections, but she doesn't male-bash, either. Austin, the alcoholic vet Rose has a crush on, comes across as a complex, sympathetic character. So does Rose's father, Chance, but I have to say my favorite character was Shep Hallford, the ranch wrangler. In this respect, Mapson's writing belongs right up there with Larry McMurtry--if he wore a skirt."
4,Relaxing and heart warming,"I thought this book was very enjoyable. It is about two sisters that are very strong and independant women and their fight to find themselves and the happiness they lack. The book covers the relationship between the two women, their fight to be ""friends"" again and the struggle of having their hearts broken at the same time. It is so good. I guess because I have a sister that is also my best friend, it was most enjoyable, for the bonding the sisters have is so heart warming. Though they are not always getting along, they still love each other very much and would do almost anything for one another. Though the plot is a little slow, I would not say it is boring, just relaxing. I would recommend this book as a great vacation read, especially to someone that thinks the female bond is an important thing."
3,Worth the read,"Good book...I didn't like it as much as the other books, but still worth the read. I agree the steriotypes were overdone, that is my one complaint of this book. The characters seemed very polarized. Good dialogue, very nice use of setting and culture. I think the romances were seen a mile away, that doesn't make them less meaningful but the story lacks a little drama because of it. The endings are not predictable though, so that gives it extra merit. Mapson is still one of my favorite authors!"
4,"Read this because I enjoyed ""Solomon's Oak"" so much!","A good portrayal of two sisters who take very different paths and have their own baggage but who ultimately love each other. Did not find this as touching as ""Solomon's Oak"" but good nonetheless."
3,"Engrossing story, albeit wordy","I've read all of Mapson's books, and I'll continue reading them as they are published. This book kept me turning the pages, although I thought the characters' behavior uneven and the writing heavy on the musings and light on action. A good story to read on a rainy day, but not exactly deep literature."
1,The Thinking Woman's Danielle Steele,"Note to Mapson: Independent women do not base their lives around men. Every woman in this book gauges her reaction in regard to the Y chromosome. I suppose it's an improvement on the Harlequin genre, but not by much."
5,"Tiny Warrior, Tremendous Impact","If you think you've read ""all those inspirational books"" before, then you haven't read this one. D.J. Vanas has crafted a tight and illuminating book that is guaranteed to make you see your life in a new way. Engaging, reflective, and often humorous in humble way, The Tiny Warrior condenses an amazing amount of wisdom into less than 100 pages. I spent more time pausing to consider what I had just read than I did actually reading it - and that's the way it should be."
5,A MUST READ,"I have read and listened to many, many ""motivational"" authors and speakers. Not until reading The Tiny Warrior did I find the ultimate in inspiring and motivational guidance. Vanas has the rare skill of packing large messages into few words. Skilfully written, this book appeals to all ages from 7 to 70 and is a ""must read"" for anyone striving to realize their full potential."
5,Native Americans will like this book.,I am introducing this book in a jail situation and it seems to be making an impact. The story is part allegory and seems at least partially real. It is a very uplifting book.
3,Bold Marauder Fan,"""Bold Marauder"" is truly Richard Farina's songwriting masterpiece. It is a powerful and haunting piece of music. Having said that, his performance of the song, does not do it justice. To experience the full impact of this song you will need to listen to John Kay on his ""Forgotten Songs & Unsung Heroes"" cd. We were able to find it on the Steppenwolf website. Wow!!!"
2,Nothing new,"Chamber of Secrets didn't really live up to my expectations. But then again I shouldn't have expected anything really. Most of the music is practically the same as Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. After listening to the CD, I didn't have any music stuck in my head like John Williams usually can make. There aren't any really exciting parts, and even if there were, they were the same as the Sorcerer's stone.Buy this CD if you want to collect all the Harry Potter soundtracks. But if you haven't heard the first one, buy that instead."
5,One word...WOW!,"As a long time fan of both John Williams and Harry Potter, you can imagine how much I was looking forward to this soundtrack. When I first heard ""Fawkes the Phoenix,"" I was absolutely blown away! I couldn't believe that John Williams had actually outdone himself! A lot of John's wonderful music from the first film is reborn along with new material. Also, if you listen hard enough, you can hear some of his other great scores sneaking in and out of the new stuff. This CD is awesome! Go buy it!"
5,Another great score,"John Williams does it again. Another brilliant score to accompany these wonderful movies. His musical depiction of Gilderoy Lockhart is priceless...so simple, yet very descriptive (he uses a very simple, snooty tune with strings and harpsichord). I can't say it's my favorite of the series, but nonetheless a great score."
3,Out of Order,"The music is pretty good, but the tracks go out of order when compared to the movie, which bugs me so much that I never listen to this."
5,Great Soundtrack!,If you liked the movie then you'll definatly like the soundtrack it has almost every song from the movie and it's even better than the first soundntrack!
1,"Im sorry to say, but I was a bit disappointed","I loved the first Harry Potter soundtrack (especially ""Hedwigs Theme"") and I was so excited about the second one. I thought it was going to be even better. When I got it, I was very disappointed. It says in the booklet that they wanted the same Harry feeling but a little bit grown up and different. I think they should stick to the first one. It felt like I was listening to the same song over and over again. And none of it was very distinct to me, the only one would probally be the first song on the soundtrack.This almost made me scared to get the Two Towers soundtrack, because I was so disappointed by this one, but I was blown away by LOTR. It was even better than the first one. Whatever Howard Shore did, John Williams needs to follow in his footsteps! I only hope the third soundtack is better than the 2nd one."
5,Another great soundtrack from John Williams,"John Williams has done it again with his musical score to ""Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets."" I bet he is again going to be nominated for an Oscar for this and hopefully win it this year. My favorite tracks are ""Fawkes the Phenioux"" and ""Moaning Myrtle."""
4,bought as a gift,"bought as a gift for an individual that is totaly a fanatic of the harry potter book series, she loves it."
3,Definately a baby's toy.,This was a very cute baby gift although make sure you buy it for a baby. I made the mistake of buying it for my 1 year old nephew and he had no intrest in it and neither did the other kids his age. I would think that this toy would go over better with a baby around 6-9 months.
3,Doesn't hold baby's interest,We bought this at during a lightning deal based on the other reviews. Our 9 month old unfortunately is not interested whatsoever. Our 4 yo girl however likes hiding the bugs and playing hide and seek with them.
5,My daughters LOVES this,"This was my daughters first toy she ever really played with. It started at 4 months, she is now 6 months and it has not gotten ""old"". She was able to grasp the spider with his eight lovely legs instantly, she LOVES the spider. She now plays with the whole jar, she swings it around and removes the bugs, keeps her entertained the longest of any toy. I don't see her getting tired of this anytime soon. She starts every morning sitting in her bumbo seat and playing with her bug jar. This toy is worth the less then $20 you pay for it. HIGHLY recommended."
5,Great toy!,"It's a great toy... it was a gift for my 6 month old but my 2 year enjoy playing with it also, he keeps putting in and out an sorting them. I always love Melissa and Doug toys and this one is must have."
4,Cute toy for older babies,"I bought this toy for my son who turned 7 months on Christmas. He still shows absolutely no interest in it. My best friend's little girl was a year old at the time and would grab the bugs and toss them to the side, so she was pretty unimpressed. Now she is almost 14 months and she can spend hours pulling the bugs out of the jug and putting them back in. She LOVES the bug jug now! The bugs are really cute (the spider still creeps me out even plushy and smiling) and they have a variety of textures. I would recommend this toy for babies over a year old. My son is 8 months now and all he wants to do is chew on the bugs and soak them with spit. I haven't been giving them to him to play with because I don't want him to soak them with drool to where I have to wash them. I'm not sure they would survive the wash and I don't want to test it before he's even old enough to appreciate the toy."
5,Great toy for under 1 year!!!,"I gave this toy to my 14 month nephew. It quickly became his favorite toy. It is fun, plastic free, and educational. A+ in my book. Good toys for this age group are hard to come by."
2,Disappointed,"The product is a ""fill & spill"" type of toy, but it doesn't do that. You can FILL the bag, but you have to practically PUSH the toys through the opening, and when you turn it over to dump everything out, nothing falls out because either the opening on the bag is too small, or the toys are too big. My baby loves to play with the toys inside, so we just leave them out because there is no way she would be able to get them in or out of the bag. A little disappointed."
3,My son had no interest in this.,"I purchased this toy as one of many to take on a long plane trip. My son was 10 months at the time and I thought he'd love taking them out and putting them back into the bug container. Not so much. While the toy is super cute and very durable, it has just sat for the last year. He has no interest in it whatsoever."
2,"Hard to fill, impossible to spill","This is a cute toy, and my baby enjoys the sensory features of the bugs, but to describe it as ""fill & spill"" is misleading. The mouth of the jar is so narrow that it takes a little force to insert or remove the plush bugs. Boo!"
3,"Super cute, but baby isn't interested...","I think this toy is very cute and well-made...each insect has various textures of fabric and makes a sound when you shake it...but for whatever reason, my baby boy and his little girl friend (both 9 months) aren't interested in it. I've made up little songs with each of the insects and I've pretended that the green jug is a megaphone, and that's gotten him a little interested, but all in all, he would rather play with other toys."
4,Cute,"We do enjoy playing with this. The bugs are hard to get out of the top so you really have to tug on them to get them out, but he is learning how to put his hand in and getting them out each time he wants to play (or put in his mouth) one of the bugs. They have nice variety of textures on them to stimulate as well."
4,Great toy!,"This toy has quickly become the favorite toy of my now 8-month-old daughter. The bugs themselves have been a popular toy for several months, but as a whole, she's just gotten the hang of putting them in the jug and pulling them out in the past month or so. The jug is a great carry case for the bugs, and all seem pretty durable... even with a dog who seems to think the ladybug is his!The toy loses one star because it's dubbed a ""fill and spill"" but there is no way a simple flip or shake will allow these toys to spill out. The neck is too narrow. It allows the baby to practice pulling things out of a container (which is great!) but it's misleading."
3,"Corny, light, Alda carries it","Got this for the store as I am a big fan of Alda, and at least in that category it did not disappoint.A story of dysfunction, memory loss, Alzheimer's and a priceless baseball card. Really, the only description worth the time is the story between Alda and Broderick's characters as uncle and nephew. Both have memory loss issues for different reasons, and they try to muddle through a couple unplanned days together. The centerpiece of their new found time is deciding what to do with their lives and a million dollar baseball card.All of the performances are painful except for Alda. He alone gives this corny film three stars. I played it in the store which both helped and hurt, as any scene where dumb people are doing dumb things it looks like a slapstick comedy, but when Alda gives those looks of pain and forgetfulness - it seems like a masterpiece. No special features, would be rated R for the tons of ""F"" bombs and other language."
4,Wonderful heart-warming story,I enjoyed the interactions of characters in this story; very down to earth. Funny and awkward situations regarding a family member with dementia. I'd recommend this movie for family viewing.
3,not dimished at all!,"A semi-sweet comedy, with a stellar cast, about our misgivings and growing old and all the steps that happen along the way."
5,Your Childhood Was Not Complete If You Didn't Have This Book,"As a child, my mother read this book to me countless times because I loved it so much. I have been trying to find one for years for my own children's book collection, because I firmly believe no collection is complete without this book. It is full of quality and classic poems, stories, tales, and beautiful pictures. I'm 19 now and this book was my favorite book by far as a child and made such an impression on me that I still want it today. I recommend it to anyone. You will NOT be dissapointed!"
5,Fantastic classic,"My wellworn volume is taped together and ragged at the edges, but I still occasionally re-read these classic stories and poems. The illustrations are beautiful and the text is truly classic. Some of my favorites are ""Wynken, Blynken, and Nod,"" ""Animal Crackers and Cocoa for Tea,"" ""The Gingham Dog and the Calico Cat,"" and ""Christopher Robin is Saying His Prayers"" (hush, hush, whisper who dares!) Thanks, mom, for letting me take this one!"
5,5 star rating by everyone is not an aberration,"I had this book lying around with me for a very long time but never bothered reading it, because my graduate school textbook was something else. But when I eventually ended up reading it, i did regret how I missed out on this genius of a book, for so long. This book is way ahead of other books in its league. The material explained are illustrated very beautifully that there would be no place where you will find it difficult to follow the book. Fantastic book, i highly recommend it to anyone who want to understand TCP/IP.If you are considering Comer Vol 1 or Richard stevens Vol 1 for TCP/IP , I would advise you give this book a serious thought too. Preferably goto a local bookstore to check them out and make a decision.If you want to quickly learn/revise TCP/IP for an interview, this is a great book too because lots of times the self-explanatory illustrations saves you a lot of time from reading the material itself."
5,Best beginner reference of TCP/IP,"As a beginner, this book can deliver a full and clear picture about details of TCP/IP including each protocol alogorithm, characteristics and it's usage. One can easily understand the TCP/IP basic architecture even without any experience after reading."
4,well worth it,"I listen to and review quite a few blues albums for a local blues show. The new Ian Siegel album was a pleasant suprise. He is a wonderful soul singer, although he can also crank out old fashioned electric blues. One of my new favorite guitarists (Matt Schofield) plays on and produced the cd. I put this cd in one of the top ten of the year so far."
3,Not as good as rated elsewhere,"Ian isn't bad and there is some good original stuff, but he is overhyped by other reviewers. I might take it out to listen to occasionally but it'snot one for the car and I HATE repeated tracks in a different style on one CD!"
5,Warning Signs,"John Kelly makes key points when he reminds his readers that adolescents have not fully matured emotionally. Parents need to help their children through their emotional growth. Parents are helping their children when they keep a close watch on them and also when they provide behavioral boundaries such as strict curfews, appropriate activities and guidance in selecting friends.The book is well written, with many case studies. It is a quick but important read."
3,dadaism on film,"This review is for the Criterion Collection DVD edition of the film.Phantom of Liberty or ""Le Fantme de la liberté"" is a film with a non conventional plot where some roles are reversed and others are depicted in an unusual manner.Monks, smoking and playing poker, people using a toilet in mixed company and eating in private like it is frowned upon when done in public, and many other things.The DVD only contains a theatrical trailer and an interview with the screenwriter for special features."
5,Excellent resource,"This is a surprisingly enlightening book, with historical information on the development of the martial philosophy up to the modern day applications. It's written to be understood but doesn't talk down to people. One of the best books yet I've seen for martial arts. I recommend it to all new practitioners as well as the seasoned ones."
4,"This book puts in perspective some of our ""every day"" ideas.","I like this book. It thought me a lot of things. That is to say that it cleared or put in to words some of the ideas I was thinking at the time. The first part of this book is an exelent path for those who are looking for a different view on martial arts if not life as a whole. With the good things said, now I have to write about the only draw back of the book. The second part of the book talks about exercises and meditation technics, and these are fine and easy to follow. However, after these technics come a serious of fighting moves an teachings that quite frankly didn'tsit well with me. I don't mean that they are bad technics. I just didn't see a real reason to have them in the book because the fighting technics shown are common to most martial arts that teach some kind of grappling. Maybe after I mature more as a person and a martial artist the secound part of the book will make sense to me. In closing buy the book and pay attention."
5,Superb,"This is the best book I have read on the history of globalization. It is superb. It is well written. It is sweeping in its vision. And the scholarship that undergirds the book is remarkable. Bayly has read widely in disparate fields like African, Chinese, Mughal, and British history, nationalism, economic development, the state, military history, and globalization.Bayly appeals to the professional historian, interested in historiographical debates over nationalism, colonialism, economic development, and many other matters. He brings these debates into his narration in a judicious manner. But historiography does not overwhelm the narrative. This is a book that can be savored by the professional historian and educated layperson alike."
1,This is the worst flight I have ever been on!,"The only thing worse than this book is being stuck on a layover with only this book to read. I am a Flight Attendant and found this book short, boring, and not worth the money. The writing is poor and I did not laugh once. She tries to make it funny and fails! I was stuck without my usual selection of magazines that passengers leave on the plane and only had this to read. I will stick to the magazines from now on!"
2,Basic collection of stories...good for one or two polite laughs,"I bought this book because I love flying and like to know how things work on the 'inside'. This was not the book for me.Marsha is a down to earth, nice person and that is exactly what comes across in the book. It's not flashy, thrilling or mystery-busting. Doesn't give too much info on how airlines, or flight attendant's work. Maybe there really isn't much going on in that world...but I would have expected 20 years of experiences to be more enlightening and interesting.This seems to be the tail-end of a collection of stories where the meat may already have been published in Ms Marks' first two books.That said..it's good for one or two laughs. Not guffaws...but polite laughs."
5,love it,"This book was exactly what I ordered. In perfect condition, and I received it very quick.my mother and I are both flight attendants- the book was perfect :)"
5,Flying By the Seat of My Pants is a blue ribbon winner!,"I can't say enough good things about Marsha Mark's Flying By the Seat of My Pants! It will make you laugh. It will make you cry.Sometimes, it will make you do both at the same time! Hopefully, it will also make you empathetic to those amazing men and women in the sky, who work very hard to keep us safe and secure.(Often, in spite of ourselves!) Do yourself a favor and purchase this book asap. Then do yourself an even bigger favor. Read it!"
5,Loved this book!,"Just finished reading ""Flying by the Seat of my Pants"" and loved it! Very easy reading. The stories will have you laughing and crying! Great for anyone who has ever dreamed of being a flight attendant. I can't wait to get hold of Marsha's other books."
3,Not that great.,"This CD simply is not as good as the first ""Worship"" CD. It is a bit poppy. Some of the songs on this CD we play at church, and play it better than MWS did on this CD. Some songs he just ruined. There are some great songs on here, but for the most part, I will be skipping a lot of them when I listen to the CD again. Probably better off burning a combo of ""Worship"" and ""Worship Again"", removing the couple bad tracks from ""Worship"" and burning a couple songs off this CD. Too bad, I was really looking forward to this CD."
3,so-so smitty,"Dear Mike,What happened? Worship 1 was on a scale of 1-10 an 11. You have dissapointed me Mike. The song selections are questionable and the mixture between soft and loud songs are poorly judged. My opinon is: stick to Worship 1."
2,"Buy a used copy for a dollar, or pass this one by","As an introductory note - I am not a Michael W. Smith fan, and have never cared much for his music ** however ** I thought his Worship CD was on of the best Christian albums of the year.So when I heard this cd I thought, What Happened? Left overs from the floor of the edit room? Tired that night? Rushed to the market?What ever the reason, this Cd does not have the, well, forgive me, inspiration of the first one. It is poorly recorded, with some of the music just plain bad.And to make things worse, he brings out the showboat - yes, Amy Grant. What was he thinking? Give this CCM drop out a break, and send her back to Vince, but keep her off your albums.In summary, save your money, find a used copy, or listen to a friend's before you decide"
4,"Not bad, but needs more original songs.","I love MWS's music, but don't anybody get tired of remaking songs that everyone else has heard a million times. Let's hear more fresh cuts from Smitty.For example, has anybody checked out the hot song Declare Your Glory on Amazon.com's free digital downloads section?I cannot get that song out of my head (that's a good thing).I don't know who Recent Rainfall is, but the song sure is fresh!Anybody else have an opinion on that song?Peace and love... out"
5,Love this music.,Fast shipment. Very smooth transaction. Will definitely do business with this seller again. A++++++++
3,"Michael, Michael, Michael!!!","After hearing this recording, then reading other reviews from others. I agree with one that was left here. (What happened?)His first recording was ""Super""! I was really surprised when I heard ""Worship Again"". Michael, if you happen too read this sometime; I feel you tried your best, but I also feel that your first recording was much,much better. Why did you try to make another recording that was totally of different style & taste?I saw Michael W. Smith many, many years ago in concert and I have always liked him. (I think that he will always be the Billy Joel of Christian Music)!I recommend this recording only to those who want to add another MWS recording to their libary. Its ok, but like the other reviewer said: ""Stick with the first""!Sorry Michael, Thanks for trying and I trust that you will do another recording with someting of better taste in the series of ""WORSHIP""!"
3,Worship again,"This album is a good one, but does not meet up with the expectations I had, since I have the original ""Worship"" album, which is outstanding !"
5,Worth purchasing,I'm not going to go into details here. If you look for a comprehensive review take a look at one of the others. All I wanted to say is that I think the album is already worth purchasing for one particular song: 'Lord Have Mercy (studio cut)'. The most touching part of the song is the second verse sung by Amy Grant. Very Moving.
2,Disappointing...,"Having adored Worship, I couldn't wait for Worship Again to come out. I was very disappointed with it. It lacked the passion and intensity that made the first CD so wonderful. Basically, it sounds like they rushed another one into production to follow up on the success of the first. Good try, but I'll stick with the original Worship!"
4,Good if you are an enthusiast,"I purchased this book for my father, who is a collector of antique decoys. I am not familiar with the content of the book, but I can give you an overall idea of it.This is a hard cover book, with large text (around size 14 font), and clear pictures with matching descriptions. The pages are thicker, not thin like some of the books they make. Most of the images are in color, but there are quite a few in black and white.My rating of four stars is based on the book's quality of a book, not of its content. I can say that my father enjoyed it."
2,Okay murder mystery,"This was my first novel by William Deverell and I decided to read it because it included some eastern philosophy. Unfortuntely, the character of Shiva is mostly hidden in this novel and the focus is on the life of the defense attorney, Max Macarthur. The back of this book states that Max, ""..embarks on a journey that threatens to shatter his firm grip on reality"" as he falls under the spell of Shiva. None of this was really included in this novel; the book was more mundane and contained the same elements other murder mysteries contain. I expected more of a focus on the character of Shiva and was dissapointed when he was downplayed. Other than that, it was a decent murder mystery that also contained a side plot of Macarthur's dealings with his girlfriend, Ruth. It lacked the excitment of most mystery books and any real surprises."
4,ok,"not based on the book- I haven't had a change to look at it - it was an impuilse buy as I was facing difficulties, hoping I won't need it but good to know I have it"
3,Easy Read and Not Deep Substance,"Pretty general - easy to read. Not a lot of substance to help you discover what really went wrong. My suggestion is another book called ""Rebuilding: When Your Relationship Ends"" by Dr. Bruce Fisher and Dr. Robert Alberti. That book will help you address the tough issues that will help you move on with life in a healthy way."
1,I Threw This One in the Trash,"To be fair, I didn't make it past the first chapter. That was enough for me. I guess if you're extremely religious, this might be an okay book for you. For me, it was only the trash bin was good enough for this book."
5,An excellent book for women going through separation or divorce,This book gives excellent advice based on the Word of God. It truly helps you to see your hurt and how God wants to help you through your pain. The author has been divorced 3 times and absolutely understands the pain of rejection and dealing with all the circumstances of being alone and moving forward.
3,its ok,"these are good quality plastic cups, but for the price they should come with an extension tube (on their website you can buy this for an additional $8). they sell the same cupping set for ten dollars less if you buy directly through the seller instead of through amazon. i like this set because it is compact (i can easily fit the whole thing in my backpack). im not sure why i was charged tax when i bought this, but the total for the order was $45 with tax and shipping. you can get a set twice as big in chinatown for that price. oh well..."
5,They work well,It's much less expensive than seeing someone. It would be nice if the product came with some documentation but they do seem to state they ae selling this only to professionals.
4,Anne Klein Desi boot,"This is a sharp pair of demi-boots. The wedge heel is just the right height to wear all day. I think they run a half size large, so the size 7 ( my regular size) slipped a bit at the heel. Wearing a heavy pair of socks with them helped immensely. I really like this pair and will wear them often!"
1,NOT a toner cartridge!,This product IS NOT a toner cartridge! It is a waste container for unused toner! Please change the advertising! Thank you!
1,hmm,"the scenes are awesome, but the father is made into a very disturbing person, in the series bunta(the dad) is not a heavy achloholic but drinks oocasionally. Also the soundtrack sucksim into hip hop but you dont get any of the original dance and hardcore beats usedin the originals.this is an ok initial D movie, but i would stick to the normal series is you have never seen the aspects of drifting."
3,Not Bad But Not Great,"I also agree that ""Close My Eyes Forever"" and ""Shock The Monkey"" should have been on here. The demos and live tracks are ok but the real entertainment are on the third and fourth CD's. You will fall out of your chair when you hear Ozzy doing ""Stayin' Alive."" The other covers are pretty good but the duet with Kelly on ""Changes"" didn't need to be here. Don't ruin a great song with someone that can't sing. The box set also comes with a book with liner notes from Ozzy on each song and a DVD with five videos on it. All in all it's not a bad set but could have been better."
5,THE OZZMAN STILL COMETH,"Okay- I read all the bad reviews BEFORE I purchased this but I still purchased it!! I Am very glad I did. For anyone who is a true OZZY fan they will understand the levels he reaches with this set, the flexability, talent and sense of humor. Ozzy has the longevity many rockers dream of but never reach. This proves he can do things other than the metal we all know and love!! This set is a great look into Ozzy's ingenious mind. For any of you hard core metal fans, you probably won't like discs 3 & 4 but the true Ozzy fan will enjoy this immensely. Rock on Oz!!!!"
2,BIG disappointment,when i found out that ozzy was coming out with a box set i was excited.until i got it i was very disappointed when i listened to it the re-remastered songs are terrible(should have left the originals)but there are a few gems in this setlike some of the demos however the song with lita ford(close my eyes forever) should have been included in the box set.you would be better off taking the money you will spend on this and wipe your butt with it.ozzy you should have done a better job next time PLEASE do not do another box set!
2,Not so great,"A sad release from one of the most famous names and faces in metal history. This collection falls far short of what it could and should have been. It is missing several of his best songs and has some odd selection choices. Included with this are all of his offshoot projects including appearences in TV progams such as the Muppet Show (yes, that's right, Ozzy on the Muppets singing with Mis Piggy), movie soundtracks, songs he did backup vocals on and some work he did with several rap artists.Highlights of the set include some great live performances including one of the best guitar solos (done by none other then Randy Rhoades) ever recorded.This set is only for the hard core collecter of Ozzy material."
2,Ozzy Fan Disapointed,I Bought This Box Set Expecting Some Songs to Be Bad But Not A Majority Of Them. To many Of The Songs Don't Have The Original Ozzy Flavor that Most Ozzy Dihard Fans Are Used Too. If You Are A true Diehard Fan DO NOT BUY THIS! Now If You Are A Newby It Won't Hurt To get A Intrest In Diferent Things That He has Done.But If You Are A Diehard Fan Would You Care About A duet With Ozzy And Ms.Piggy For Crying Out Loud!!!!!
2,Garbage,Most of the songs are poor quality and sound like they were recorded on a tape recorder. Go get the remastered versions of his cds instead. This is a waste of money. beware this is not a greatest hits collection. Its for collectors only and knowing that they could have made a better quality box for it than this garbage.
3,its ok,i don't really know why there isn't more of his own songs on therethere are good songs on this album but their is crap toowhat they should have done is put more ozzy songs and a little sabbathbu they put some real random things on there they i still don't getsorry but i can only give this album 2 1/2 stars could have been way better
2,What's the point???!!,"Why would someone bother to buy this one? The simple inclusion of the tracks from BLIZZARD OF OZZ and DIARY OF A MADMAN not featuring Bob Daisley and Lee Kerslake would be enough to avoid this like the plague. Then, we come to the content of the box itself...There are some box that cointains absolutely everything recorded by the artist inq uestion (example: MESSAGE IN A BOX, from The Police). Of course, in Ozzy's case, it would be impossible to do that in four discs. So, the artist has to throw some juicy gems around the box set, to make it really worth.But what did they do? A lot of annoying cover versions, annoying duets (the worst of them all being the butchering of ""Changes"" along with his bad-mouthed and spoiled daughter, Kelly), previously released live versions, some demos. The product has no face, no purpose. Avoid it! (or make Sharon earn more money, it's up to you...)"
1,Ozzy's dead,"This is only a rehash of most of his other greatist hits albums with some very un-prince of darkness-like covers. Twentyfirst Century Schizoid Man and Sympathy for the Devil(two cool songs originally), for instance, sound simply neutered. He wouldn't admit it, but Zakke is probably embarrassed by this obvious cash in attempt. Why can't we choose zero stars?"
2,Ozzy should be ashamed.,"I would have given this only one star, but out of respect for Lemmy, I gave it two. Ozzy should learn from Lemmy and stay true to his metal values. The last few weeks Ozzy has been whining about how sorry he is for The Osbournes and how he just wants to be Ozzy again. And he keeps excusing this horrible box set by blaming it on his record company.Knock it off, Ozzy. Put Sharon in her place and tell her you're not going to compromise yourself or your fans anymore. Get back in the studio with the Sabs and Rick Rubin and don't come out until you've made some proper metal. And if you can't do that, at least call Zakk and Mike Inez and start writing some great songs again for a solo album."
2,Just get The Essential Ozzy Osbourne instead,"Basically, after looking over the tracks, there seems to be a lot of padding with tracks that I really don't care about. If you are an Ozzy fan, and I am, then you will do yourself a favor by saving your money and purchasing the Essential Ozzy Osbourne instead. It has pretty much all the hits you're looking for at a fraction of the cost. I'd say pass this one up unless you ABSOLUTELY have to have everything Ozzy puts on a CD."
4,Still a Fan,I have been a fan of Ozzy since 1975. This album has some great moments on it. I truly enjoyed the 4th disc with the covers. I think any true Ozzy fan will buy this to complete their collection. I have to laugh to think I still have alot of his music on vinyl. He is a true genius. Not many artists can say that they have had fans in every decade since the 1960's and continue to record and tour. So I would recommend the box set to any that call themselves true fans.
3,I would agree with this review:,"""Ozzy had just been ousted from Black Sabbath, and was in career purgatory and fading fast before teaming up with the original BLIZZARD OF OZZ musicians. That band is very largely responsible for helping Ozzy get back into the game, and for Ozzy and Sharon to deny Daisley and Kerslake their well earned and deserved royalties by removing their work from those albums is TOTALLY reprehensible"".Sharon Osbourne should be embarrassed beyond belief of what they did to Iron Maiden at the concert in Devore California a few years back."
2,gift for my husband,this was a gift for my husband's birthday.he would have liked a better variety of songs.
5,Prince Of Darkness,My daughter in law loved this Christmas gift and it arrived on time. Thanks for your attention to detail.
1,Sharon ruin Ozzy,"It was over when they decided to egg maiden, BLS done. BURY YOUR DEAD done. anyone involved is over metal heads are angry of how childish this was.[...]read that webpage old bassist said ozzy didn't even write his own songs. so, if that is true ozzy is no more then a britney spears. Musicians write there own songs and if you got to sing someone else's stuff your fake."
1,Nothing special.,There is alot of filler meterial but there is also alot of garbage like the rap metal duo's which I can't understand for the life of me. This box should have been decent rather then fair but I agree that this set is pretty much just a cash grab.
3,what a crappy package,"I didn't like the way the booklet fell into my lap after removing the wrapping. Did they have to cut cost that much and not pay for staples?I also have an issue with the ""remastered"" versions of blizzard & diary songs. I guess they wanted to screw Daisley and Kerlake yet again. Sorry boys no roaylties from this boxset.They live tracks are nice to have, but come on a cover song with that Pig (No not Sharon), Miss Piggy.More thought could have been put into the track list for disc 3. Why the hell did they put Dog the bounty hunter on there.And it's blasphemy to put the kelly/ ozzy version of chnages on there. At least it is the very last track.bottom line, spend your $40 bucks on the original album and download the cover songs."
4,Good Boxset!!!,I just got this today from Best Buy That's how you get the bonus dvd with 5 videos. I think this is a good boxset you get live stuff plus demos and the covers. My only complaint is not getting the original versions of Ozzy's classics Blizzard Of Ozz and Diary Of A Madman. I still have my old copies so that is good enough. Highly Recommend!!!
1,rip off,SHARON - Quit trying to rip off Ozzy's fans (like me) - you're going to turn us against you!this is just another scam to take advantage of Ozzy's fans.SO SAD.......
2,Waste,"4 cds, a duet with Miss Piggy and STILL no ""Close My Eyes Forever"" his (only) top ten hit with metal goddess Lita Ford. (Sharon must still be angry with Lita over being fired from being her manager in 1990)I did enjoy the last disc of covers, but not a big fan of demos and live tracks. This could have been a great set, but it just seems sorta rushed. (BTW-Where is the Coal Chamber/Ozzy duet on ""Shock The Monkey""? Another great track MIA.)"
3,It sounds pretty good once I get it to work,Well...the product did not work out of box. Thought I have to do a RMA but gave Behringer Tech support online a try. Turned out the problem was solved by a simple reset of the system which the provided manual does not cover. Credit the Behringer online Tech support for their promptness in replying my inquiry. This is quite a versatile piece of equipment...especially if one needs A/D as well as sample rate conversion between sources. The analog output sound is surprisingly good...considering its price as well as its purpose as a professional product.
2,Not 100% cotton or proper BDUs,"These are decent pant but if you're in the market for 100% cotton ripstop BDUs, these are not what you're looking for. If you're looking for Cotton/Poly blend you can generally get a better deal elsewhere.Description states: cotton which is misleading. Should read cotton/poly. I don't believe these are milspec. The other milspec BDUs I have all had button fly - these are zippered.These are made in China and the stitching is sloppy. Of course, that's not directly related to being made in China. Comparing to Propper brand BDUs these just don't compare.I suggest these instead:Olive Cotton Ripstop BDU PantsPropper also makes a poly/cotton blend which is more durable but less comfy than the all cotton and cheaper than these.I am returning mine."
3,not as good the polyester or the aramid,i wear them but i am not crazy about themalso the zipper hangs up sometimesquality is poor
4,"Good quality pants, one minor flaw","These are some good pants. They're comfortable, go with most things you wear depending on the color choice, and have a hundred pockets which makes them useful for a guy like me living a high speed lifestyle. But gosh darn it the buttons sure do fall off easily. The stitching there was a little cheap, I felt. For those who buy the pants because they're military-like, they should feel glad the company took that extra step for military realism, but better stitching or more spare buttons (original spares fell off too) would be nice."
2,On time but too big!,I received the product on time but the size is way too big even though I compensated by ordering a smaller size than usual. I think I will have to sell them on rather than opt for putting on an extra 5 kgs so that they fit!
1,missing item,"Ultra Force Vintage Paratrooper Fatigues, Cargo Pants (XX-Large, Black)Ordered 2 pair Have not received the order yet. I has been 3 weeks."
2,Ehhh,The pants got here fast and they look like the ones in the picture but the sizing was way!!!! Off!! And the material is really thin.I haven't returned them yet because I gave them to my husband who said he will wear them around the house.
5,FAVORITE PANTS,"I bought these pants for my son, and he loves them. I got a pair in every color, and this is all he wears. they do not shrink, but we did find they run small in the waist. he is 13, and wears a 29"" waist, and we had to get the mens medium. i thought the small would have fit, but it was a very fast exchange with the company. no problems at all. and they tie on the bottom, so the lenghth does not matter. will buy again!! very well made product!!! A+++++++++ THANKS!!"
3,pants,"ok, byt have gone back to different brands. Fit wasnt too good and they didnt lander very wellNot bad but also dont last too long"
3,A little disappointed,The zipper broke the second time I wore them. the pants over all seem well built and durable however the zipper on mine broke. I'm sure my results however is not typical. A good pair of pants but be careful with the zipper.
4,Great pair pants!,"Fits great and work for any occasion. Use everyday at work and own almost every color. I recommend it to anyone in law enforcement, construction, or outdoorsman."
4,Paratrooper pants,"Overall really like the look, fit and feel of this cargos. The only drawback is the cheapness of the zipper, feel it might fail before the pants wear out. Would recommend lubricating zipper with soap or similar for smooth operation."
2,Stone Cargo Pants,"Although extremely durable, this pair was too long for me. Several seems come unstitched, which had to be resowen. I have three other pair of these pants in other colers that have served me very well for years."
4,Best work pants that I found so far. 4.5 stars,These pants are great for working the best work pants I have found to this day. Light with some flex to them and 8 pockets to store material in the only way I see these pants improving is putting zippers on the 4 side pockets instead of buttons and makeing the back pockets a little bigger.
2,cargo pants,"These cargoes fit well. I had to have the ankle ties replaced with elastic, as they were always coming loose. The zipper is cheap and sticks. I had to have that replaced as well."
3,Low Quality,Over all this a rather low quality item.The zipper hangs and feels as though it will brake at any moment.There suppose to fit a wide range of waist sizes but the adjustment straps on the sides will not stay put.
4,vintage paratrooper cargo pants,"the product is nice! although i was running in them for a few, and had my touch screen phone in the pocket, somehow it made black marks on the outside of the pants in the shape of my phone, you can see where the camera was, and everything.. hope this helps. ohhh and not pure cotton at all!!!!!!!"
4,Great find!,"These pants are great, they wash nicely and fit to size. Not too much to iron as well. A nice compliment to the wardrobe."
4,men's cargo pants,i really love this pair of pants that i purchase the only problem i had was the length of these pants was a little too long so i had them shorten
2,Sent me the wrong size,"I ordered a medium and I received a Large, even though the shipping receipt said ""medium"". Its impossible for me to wear these, they're just way too big. The pants seem durable and strong, so I wish they would have sent me the correct size. Don't really know how to rate, since the problem is with the provider and not with Amazon, and the product seems high quality."
3,Very comfy but super large/wide,"Love the multiple pockets; very functional pair of pants.NOT a fan of the width of the pants. It feels like I am wearing a pants that is waaaaay to big even though the fit at the waist is comfortable (bought size 32 by 32). If you have a normal size butt, this is going to be way too big for you."
5,Great product!!,"I couldn't ask for a better pair of pants for what I needed! These are roomy, and VERY comfortable. I have found no issues at all with the pants, and I would purchase these again. Being camo, I know they probably aren't real stylish, but I wear one of the 2 pairs I bought whenever possible."
3,Too tight...,"I ordered a size smaller than usual since everyone was saying they're too loose, but these are too tight on me! Guess I over-compensated. Oh well. Nice looking pants though."
1,Very poor,My pants had missing buttons and were long enough to fit someone a foot taller than me. Hope you have better luck
5,Well built and ready to go,"These were ready to go right out of the box, which was good because I wore them for the next two days down in the Everglades. Most military spec pants I have owned require a substantial amount of breaking in before they are comfortable but these did not. Highly recommend."
4,Good product,"Good product that has lasted a long time. No color fade or stitching has come loose. Thanks, I'm wearing it right now actually"
1,Not happy,I do believe I was mislead. The picture of what I thought I was ordering was a solid black pair of paratrooper pants. That is not what arrived to me. I checked into sending this back but it looked like a huge hassle. I tried to call the customer service number but it said it was no longer in service. I am a mother of two very young children and I work two jobs so for me this was very disappointing.
2,Below Average Movie.....,"Perfume is a ridiculous display of wealthy neurotic NYC yuppies and their self-centered lives. It is a waste of time to watch this one, unless you want to see what is wrong with America today. That these people probably do exist, and have positions with some prestige, is a testament to the decadence of NYC in specific and America in general. This movie is just one absurd, disjointed, and boring scene after another.The only reason I gave it two stars rather than one star is that it does reveal, albeit in a non entertaining manner, the sick and tragic people involved in the NYC art and fashion world."
1,"If you want an hour and a half of improv, this is for you","The little caveat at the beginning of the credits should also be on the DVD box, ""All actors dialogue was improvised"".Wow, does that certainly make a difference. Perfume had an excellent cast including Jared Harris, Jeff Goldblum, Mariska Hargitay, Rita Wilson, Paul Sorvino, Peter Gallagher, et al, in roles that would have been fantastic if fleshed out. However, the movie fell flat due to choppy and hesitant dialogue, save two scenes that were excellent and seemed lifted from an actual movie.This movie doesn't even reach the level of a good documentary, but is more like sitting through an improv class. In my opinion it's not worth sitting through for the very few reedeming moments. Unless you want to see how well some of your favorite actors perform when improvising the entire movie."
1,This Book Wasn't What I Expected!!,"First of all, I want to start out saying that I have approx 5 1/2 inches of natural hair and I was looking for a book that had pictures of styles and instructions of what to do with natural hair. All the book talked about was how to put in extensions and the different kinds. The writing was extremely poor and there were several spelling and editing errors. Someone looking for natural hair styles without mostly talking about extensions would be better off buying Pamela Ferrel's ""Let's Talk Hair"", which was my own personl hair bible.In MY OWN PERSONAL OPINION ""The Kink Kollection"" is not even worth spending $1 on never mind the nearly $25 spent. The only valuable info is in the last couple of pages where she tells you the business aspects of how to start a natural hair care salon. You can get that info on the internet without spending $25."
4,We love it!,"Very easy to grind, holds a lot of pepper, and well made. I should think that especially for an older person, or someone with carpal tunnel, or weak hands, this would be wonderful.We are very happy with it, and I'd be happy to buy more. The only caveats of this thing are: it feels, while not cheaply made, not as sturdy as it could have been, and though ours is fine, ti's only six months old. I don't know how long it will really last - maybe five years? Also, while we love the capacity, that capacity comes at a price in terms of table real estate - it takes up a fair amount of room.But it grinds peper into nice, largish chunks, to let the true pepperiness through, and I like it better than our wooden grinders. Great stuff!"
3,Fun but slow and crampy.,"We bought both the salt and pepper grinders after seeing these on my Dad's table, years ago. The action is a little weird on the hands because to get any good amount of salt or pepper you have to squeeze it like 20 times. I have unusually strong hands, but as I get older they tire easier. These now sit on our ""Fun, not used much shelf"" above the stove. They're fun, look great on the table, friends love them when they use them at our house. We like the crank handle grinders better for everyday use. Don't use these for cooking, you'll tire of them."
4,Beautiful look! The band's not bad either :),"Had been hearing about Umphrey's for years as they are always playing in St Louis.Got a new Blue Ray for Christmas, and saw this DVD...fate.Great band, interesting music, fabulous look on this DVD.Good thing they are all good looking guys or those close ups would be killer.Don't think I'd want to see a new live video of The Stones on Blue Ray."
5,Pandora,"""Crossword puzzles"" Working the puzzles was fun for me. Crosswords taxed my understanding of latin words. It sort of made me feel how dense i know latin words. At times, I would breeze through easily. Other exercises would make me procrastinate. At all times, the book was fun and challenge. After Crossword Puzzles in Latin, I know i have a richer latin vocabulary. For the minimal price the book is a sort of pandora o understanding. You will never know until you work them out."
1,Awesome Easy Latin Crosswords,Hey it got here quick and it's in really great condition... I think it's all right...Marty
1,Don't Bother,"If you loved her previous work, then don't bother buying this CD. The songs all sound the same...BORING. Her voice is great, but this CD is less than what I would have expected from Toni."
1,more than a women sucks,toni braxton one of the biggisest r a b stars just had to go and make a suckie album like this im dissapointed and the song i hate the most is hit the freeway i mean what is she sayin she must be talkin chinnese and then she wanted to mess with loon irv gotti and the big tymers just because she sucks that dosen't mean u rub the suckie on them there good u need to make a better album or get anothere job because u and hip hpo don't work
3,"Toni Toni Toni, what happened?","Toni Braxton has one of the sultriest voices in music today and its a shame she has yet to put out an exciting album that showcases the true talent she really is. Toni's fourth album tries something new by adding a little more hip hop and edge to her songs, but she still fails to deliver anything as sexy as You're Makin Me High, or as dramtic and powerful as Un Break My Heart. Selfish and And I Love You are the only songs that come close to Toni having a power ballad, and Hit The Freeway and Give it Back are [bad] attempts at trying to have the success of new artists such as Ashanti. Only a few songs on the album sound hit worthy and the rest are just fillers. Fans of Toni will no doubt emabrace this album, but I suggest trying out new artists like Heather Headley. Heathers album, This is Who I Am, is the album Toni should have made."
5,More than ur average singer,"Not just any singer can continue to deliver good albums over the years. Toni proves to be a true talent, a singer who can grow through the years and continue giving her fans good music. Toni has worked with different people this time around givin her album a new contemporary sound. This CD exemplifies what true R&B Soul should be!! If you love R&B you'll love this CD!! My fav songs are ""Let me show you the way out"", ""Rock me Roll me"" and ""Always"". Once again Toni has failed to dissapoint me...keep givin us these great albums TONI!"
4,Braxton Returns Revitalized,"Two and a half years on from the complete trainwreck that was her third release THE HEAT, Toni Braxton returns with what is undoubtedly her strongest set to date in MORE THAN A WOMAN. Thankfully leaving behind the hollow sappiness of Diane Warren and David Foster, we find Braxton jettisoning garbage like the previous 'Spanish Guitar' and 'Un-Break My Heart' in favor of sultry, mid-tempo grooves that showcase her smoky alto to superb effect. Even more surprising is the equal mix of slow burners and up-tempo fare, with Braxton giving a little nod to current trends without selling out(like many will unjustly accuse her of doing, I'm afraid)--'Let Me Show You The Way(Out)' and 'Hit The Freeway' are among the best cuts here, as well as 'Lies, Lies, Lies' and 'Tell Me'(which very cleverly samples Anita Baker's classic 'Sweet Love'). Those, like me, who nearly gave up on Braxton after that last album should do an about-face with this set."
2,I love me some TONI but not this album....,"Toni Braxton is one of my favourite female singers... she is a younger version of anita baker (to me) her voice is just brilliant.... i was looking forward to MORE THAN A WOMAN because i have not heard a word from Toni in a long min. i love the first single 'hit the freeway' that is my joint so i went and bought the album...i was stunned by the lack of effort in this CD (i know she had a baby so that slowed things down).this cd did not have the signature producer of the album: babyface. babyface put her on the map and it was a shame she did not want him on this LP (janet jackson worked with jimmy jam and terry lewis for 20 years and she is still hot).anyways this cd had too much baby from cash money... i dont like cash money at all... the lackluster 'me and my boyfriend' sux and... well the whole album was wack...worst effort to date but i still love ""hit the freeway""...download-a-ble...2 stars"
4,This CD got slept on,"At first I thought this CD was forgettable but once I really gave it a real listen, I changed my mind. The words are deep (refreshing), the beats are different(very refreshing) and Toni's voice does not fail to impress (consistent for her). This album should have done better than it did. Especially if all of the fed up women out there knew about it, but how would they when the male dominated radio industry picks what gets played and what doesn't? A great album for ladies to vent through. P.S. this review is from Chris' wife, and he's still around!"
2,Toni needs Babyface Again,"What a disppointment! Toni has one of the best voicest in the industry, but it's wasted by bad production, weak melodies, and watered-down commericialized hip-hop R&B that disguise her vocal talent. She has sold out folks -- all it takes is one look at the ""Hit the Freeway"" video to realize that she's peddling glitter to fans and is not longer into the artistry. I surely hope she'll get back with Babyface to produce her next album."
2,"Irv Gotti , Loon and Big Tymers Killed This Album","Like many that have reviewed this album, I am a fan of Toni's earlier efforts ""Toni Braxton"" and ""Secrets."" The songs on those albums represented her true vocal talent. While ""The Heat"" wasn't a bad album, it was a slight step backward from the first two albums, however, ""More Than A Woman"" has to be her worst album production wise. I understand her wanting to reach out to a younger audience, but Irv Gotti, Loon, Big Tymers, and others are not the answer. What saves the album are the ballads ""Rock Me, Roll Me,"" ""Selfish,"" ""Always,"" and ""I Love You,"" ""Do You Remember"" and ""Tell Me."" I am glad that Toni is going to back to Babyface though. 2.5 stars."
1,Her worse CD!!!,I am a big Toni Braxton fan and own all of her CDs. This CD is by far her worse CD ever. I am not sure what she was thinking when she made this record. I hope the next release allows her to redeem herself.
1,Disappointing to say the least,"Toni Braxton's latest album is the second disappointment in a row. Her first three albums contained tunes that hit me right between they eyes, particularly songs like ""Unbreak my Heart"" and ""Another Sad Love Song"". To me, nothing there is nothing distinguishing on this album. It was difficult to tell one track from another. It seems to me that Ms. Braxton could be the new Whitney Houston, in that her ability with ballands is second to none. An opportunity wasted with this album."
2,"""More than a woman?""....LESS than an ALBUM!","Braxton is merely ""going through the motions"" in this attempt to appeal to a cross-section of the listening audience. Not a single track on this release is worthy of the singer or the attention of the buying public. There are no selections that grab ya.I hate to be critical of an artist of her caliber, but Braxton needs to go back to the drawing board, i.e., her acclaimed pairings with Babyface and the sultriness that is her forte."
3,"Funky, but not ""Toni""","I thought the CD was quite funky and updated. However, it was just not the Toni Braxton I love. She's a superb vocalist but she really didn't ""sing"" much in this CD. I thought she'd make a better comeback. I missed her soulful ballads with added passion. I agree with other comments, she should re-try with LaFace!"
1,An absolute waste of money - what happened to Toni?,"This was awful, a complete waste of money. Toni should either concentrate on making babies or music. It was such a disapppointment. The CD did not seem to have any direction, too many producers. There was no flow, no lyrical content and too much complaining. If this is more than a woman, I'd rather stay just a woman!! Toni has such talent and should choose her producers and the music she sings very carefully. Next time I will wait for a used copy before rushing out to buy the CD because it is Toni Braxton. Don't bother with this one."
2,Disappointment,"I am a big Toni Braxton fan and was one of the first people at the store to pick up the new album. Boy, was I disappointed. I agree...this is not her best work. Her last albums(including the Christmas one) were all great with good quality songs but, I didn't find that on this one. Even the Babyface and Darryl Simmons songs were lackluster. Well, it wasn't broke so she shouldn't have fixed it and changed up what was working before with the hit albums. This one doesn't fly. Even the provocative image won't sell this album. Time will tell."
2,"Her Voice&Album Cover are still Hot,but","the Album on a whole is a Lemon.seems Contrived&forced.I can tell She isn't happy with the Music Industry Politics going down.I would figure with Her Being a Piano Player,Good Vocalist,Her Husband Kerri Lewis being a tight Instrumentalist&Babyface working with Her that the three of them would be all you would need to making a Album? but not with the majors these days.too many sauces going on with this Album enough Flavor.Her Voice Saves this Album."
1,don't get me wrong I am a toni fan,"2002 was the year that hip hop was all over the airwaves and the quality had nothing to do with that. So toni decided to go hip hop and even name her album after an aaliyah song and it sounded like a hot mess. This was not the toni I was used to hearing, but her new music from her upcoming record Libra sounds awesome and like Mariah Carey, she will make a huge comeback. This album was just a low point but she'll bounce back from it"
5,Toni you are Super,"i am very happy to have this chance to point my little views. first of all toni you have been the great singer apart all singers, you have the strenght and the confidence. i liked your music since i was 15 years old now i am 23. i haven't listened to your new album but i think its great. once more keep it up toni!!"
2,Better Luck Next Time Toni,"I am a big Toni Braxton fan,but this is her worst album.I do believe that Toni have enough talent to bounce back from this sorry album.This album is not worth having,but I am stuck with it now.I can't wait for her next project to come out.This flop won't make me turn my back on my girl,I'll be the first in line to buy her next album.Still love you Toni."
2,what happend?!?,"When she released ""The Heat"" I was so thrilled of how good the album was..few years later knowing that she had a new album ""More than a woman"" coming up I was thrilled again.. ""Hit the freeway"" was a good track to start off. But after I got a chance to get the c.d it's was bad..I only liked ""hit the freeway"" & ""let me show you the way(out)"" very bad album it's like a r&b meets rock gone bad ""me & my boyfriend"" was good but here verses was soooo airry! I just wished Irv Gotti pimped her out a little bit thank god she didn't release this as her first single. Buy it only if you like typical airy r&b"
1,A Hip-Hop Disaster,"Just when I thought she had she had hit an all-time low with ""The Heat"", Toni comes back and hits rock bottom with ""More Than A Woman"". Obviously a pitiful attempt to capture the interest of the hip-hop audience, ""More Than A Woman"" is a disaster from beginning to end. I mean, I don't have to say much. Just listen to snipets of the songs and you'll see how horrible they are. Other than her first album, I've never been very impressed by Braxton's vocal ability. This album proves most of her success has been based on her looks and not her voice. Avoid this one."
1,Last 3 albums is Toni failure,"I'm very dissapointed with Toni perfomance on this album, all songs except ""Hit the freeway"", lacked famous Toni smooth tender deep voice. It is like ""Heat"" album which is still wondering me ""why it get Grammy?""."
2,Richard (Madrid),"Toni, Toni, Toni. What's happened? After the marvelous ""The Heat"" and to a lesser extent ""Snowflakes"", apart from ""A better man"" it all seems to have lost the plot somewhat with ""More than a woman"". Have a word with Babyface and see if he can get it back on track for you. I shan't buy your next album on reputation alone. Sorry."
1,Oh dear!,"Toni, or whoever is pulling the strings for her, appears to have completely lost the plot with her latest album ""More than a woman"". Inovation and development are all very well but the songs on the album are so lacking in depth and R&B. They remind me of how Prince sold-out with ""Purple Rain"" and such after such a promising start.I can't be bothered to detail anything about individual songs as they don't demand any constructive comment.She needs to have a word with Babyface to try to get things back on track (sic) as far as I am concerned.I shall not be buying another of Toni's albums on reputation alone."
2,A Greatest Hits CD Would Be Better!,"Well, I just listened to 'More Than A Woman', the new CD from Toni Braxton, and let me tell you that it wasn't the great work that I expected from Toni.The CD is produced by a large number of producers (at least one for each of the 12 tracks!!), and Toni's vocals aren't used properly (... Toni's vocals can't rescue the weakest songs!!).The CD lacks focus, and it's a shame for Toni to continue singing the mundane R&B.In my opinion, Toni should've released a 'Greatest Hits' CD, and used the 2-3 quality songs on this new project as bonus tracks.This CD pales in comparison to Braxton's previous 3 projects!!My verdict-This CD is probably the WORSE by Toni Braxton, and only her die hard fans will enjoy mere portions of it.If you MUST have it, get a ... used copy (there will be plenty of them available!!)."
1,awful,"totally a major disappointment....i purchased this c.d. without listening to one song based on miss braxton's previous work which i adored...this c.d. is strictly commercial and is basically soft-core rap, one song after the next...there is not one song on this c.d. that i truly like and i will never listen to it again.....she completely deviated from her sultry, rymthm and blues ballads and songs displaying the quality of ber voice to singing JUNK.....i don't think i'll ever purchase another one of her c.d.'s unless i listen to it entirely."
2,p.u.,im not sure what toni is doing or trying to get across on her new cd but it is a big p.u. Toni has gone away from her better what got her to where she is vocal style. This is what is left a cd with no real direction or feel to it. Better luck next time i hope
3,Not as bad as people make it out to be,"A lot of people (including Toni herself) consider this TB's worst album. I'll admit that out of all of 6 albums (Not counting remix and hits albums), this one ranks at number 6 but it wasn't that bad. Her vocals were on point. Most of the lyrics were on point. More Than A Woman is not her best album but I think it is worth owning."
4,She's back!!:),I like this Cd a lot. It is very different from her previous albums. This shows the hip-hop Toni. I recommend this because it is good. It is fresh and new!!
4,A step up,"Let me start by saying that I thought Toni was on her way out when she released her third album ""The Heat"" in 2000, but ""More than a woman"" (her latest and fourth offering), has proved me wrong. Although the album is different from her first (Toni Braxton - 1993) and sophomore (Secrets - 1996) albums that established her as a household name in R&B circles world-wide in the nineties. The album is definitely within today's range and I think she has proved that even an 'ole gal' like herself can kick some ... in today's comepetitive music market. Tracks to look-out for: ""Hit the freeway"", ""A better man"", and ""Do you remeber when"" are awesome. ""Rock me, Roll me"", ""Selfish"" and the her rendition of 2Pac's ""Me and my Boyfriend"" are sexy. ""Tell me"" is naughty. ""And I love you"" and ""Always"" are sultry and oh so Toni! Get this album and do yourself a favour and let Toni prove she's ""More than a woman!"""
5,great cd,This is her best cd. It's about time she came out with a more club sound. Although she has some slow dance songs. Even these are great. Toni has outdone her self with this cd.
4,Toni is still the bomb!!,"I remembered when I first bought and listened this CD, I thought it was trash. After listening to it a few more times, I realized that it's a good CD and I just had to give it a chance. She has some very good songs on this CD. It's not her best CD ever released but it's very good. The only problem I saw with this CD was that it was not promoted enough. Now I see why she left Arista records and signed with Blackground records. Toni is still the bomb!!!"
5,More Than The Heat,"Toni braxton's latest effort is worth the listen. She provides a record with catchy dance hits and unforgetable ballads. She takes a step up from ""The Heat,"" and proves that she is more than a woman, artistically. She moves past all the man-hating songs and shows where she stands in life. Songs like ""Tell Me"" and ""Selfish"" moves her past the broken heart and sings about love. On the other hand, she stick to what she knows best and provides the powerfulk ballad ""Lies, Lies, Lies."" A song that is worth the entire album. Also, ""Rock Me, Roll Me"" gives insight on what women need in a relationship. If you want to dance, relax, and think of songs that describe your significant other whether you're hating or loving that person, this is the best album."
2,More Than.....needs More work!,"She still has a great voice, but this cd lacks a lot! I have tried to listen to it several times, but it is just not good. Seems to have been rushed. I really enjoyed Toni Braxton's other cd's (even the Christmas cd), so I decided to buy this one without sampling it. That was not smart. Save your money and wait to see what the future brings from Toni. Hopefully, she will pair up with Babyface again and get back to her sultry ballads. ""Selfish"" and ""Hit the Freeway"" are good, but that is about as good as it gets."
4,Beautiful Music and a Beautiful Woman,"Toni's latest effort is great but it's one that might need to grow on some. If you have been a fan, you will love this album. If you are just discovering her, where have you been? I feel that this album is just as beautiful as she is. I'm tired of turning on the radio and hearing that [stuff]...that artists continue to record and sell hit records. This one, however, is one to purchase! Get yours today!"
1,Thanks for nothing,"I can not believe that music has been this bad all year long, butthis piece ... takes the cake. You mean to tell me and all the other true TB fans that after 21/2 years and a baby this is what we get? Keri Lewis was [bad] with Mint Condition so why would he be any better with this project. I am very understanding to his lack of employment but I do not feel Toni should have made us suffer. WHY? WHY? WHY? I was so disgusted with this CD that I only played the day it was released. I should have ran it over with my car. PLEASE TONI UNBREAK OUR HEARTS"
1,Not the same Toni,"This CD has the look of Toni but not the sound. It's full of over produced bass and percussion that completely takes away from her sultry voice and superb lyrics. By using the latest trends in mixing, the Toni of old is lost or wasted. I will not ever buy another CD of hers and cherish the old. Her talent is too much to squander for a hip sound. There is not one song on this CD that I can listen too."
3,Decent - But not Her Best,"I've purchased and enjoyed all of Toni's previous CDs, but I just can't get into this one. I enjoy the first release, ""Freeway"", ""Me and My Boyfriend"" and a FEW others."
4,More than a pretty face!!!!,"Toni's back and she is giving us a cd with smooth, hip hop oriented songs. While I don't like this cd as much as I did ""The Heat"", its still a good piece of work and lets her fans know that she's willing to work with different producers. Babyface is only involved with one song on the cd so Toni is working with new producers to give her a different sound. I really like the first song, ""Let Me Show You the Way (Out)"". My other favorites include ""Hit the Highway"", ""Gimme It Back"" and ""Tell Me"". I once read a review that called Toni a cross between Whitney Houston and Anita Baker (Anita, where are you? would love to hear a new cd!!!) and I thought that was a nice compliment. But now she stands on her own and needs no comparison to anyone. This is a good cd to add to your R & B collection."
3,I am a loyal fan,"I love Toni Braxton. She is on my top ten list of female vocalists. However, I am really disappointed with this album, which is why I chose to review it. It is 2005 and I still listen to the first two cd's(Toni Braxton & Secrets) like they just debuted yesterday. I liked ""The Heat"" because it was a versatile album but it still possessed Toni Braxton's flavor. However, upon first listen of More Than A Woman, I was upset. I felt it trailed a little to far into the Hip-Hop side of things. But, Toni does redeem herself with a few ballads. If it were not for my immense love for this artist and her amazing voice, I don't think I would own this album. But with all that said, she reigns supreme amongst today's top selling artists."
2,Disappointing,"I have everything by Toni, & this last cd was disappointing. Thank God I didn't purchase it with my own money. It was a gift. Not the usual Toni stuff. I was not feeling it. I like hit the freeway and me and my boyfriend. When you own a cd and you only like 2 tracks, that's sad. Maybe you should wait until you receive it as a gift like I did and not waste your money, and this is coming from a Toni Braxton fan...."
5,It is one of the best I have ever read.,This is a really good book. I just wished I could get it for my Kindle. I have read this book at least 20 times and never get tired of it.
3,Love's Desperate Deceit by Kay McMahon,"True to Kay McMahon, 'Love's Desperate Deceit' contains all of McMahon's familiar elements: deception, blackmail, murder, intrique, a spoiled and headstrong heroine and an overbearing arrogant hero. This combination can only produce a lively and interesting Kay McMahon novel. McMahon has a way of expressing herself to her readers, encouraging the readers to continue to the next chapter to see whom will win this battle of strong wills! Well, I'll say no more, read 'Love's Desperate Deceit' and you'll enjoy it as you will many other Kay McMahon novels!"
4,Good Technical Treatment of WWI Airplanes and Tactics,"A fine book on the development of Airplanes, Tactics andorganizations of Fighter Airplanes in WWI, also gives brief biography of some pilots. A good quick survey concentrating on the technical aspects of the aircraft, tactics, and organizations. A much more in depth treatment is They Fought for the Sky, by Quentin Reynolds."
5,Poised at a Moment of Change,"Will be appreciated by most readers possessing a sensitivity to the often-agonizingly-beautiful moments in the passage of time.This book addresses a time that is lost to us... when post-war Europe was a third world realm. But it coincides with activities of the author (Pulitzer winning poet) who was becoming an adult.Yeah, it is something of a prose Bolero (the sweet, evenly paced orchestral piece that drives some people crazy), but I loved it. Merwin has an unbelieveably detailed memory, keen appreciation of culture, and delightfully soft touch with syntax.Really wonderful gift for your favorite nostalgic."
2,Mind-numbingly boring,"In my experience, memoir written by writers/poets is among the very best reading out there. Summer Doorways was dull. Far too much description of the places without enough said about the people involved."
2,Closed Door,"I did not see the value of this bland memoir. W.S. Merwin is a capable writer but the story he tells here will have little interest to any but close family friends and those particularily keen on this minor author's early career. ""Without direction or prospect.."" Words taken from the book that seem apt.(I do rank the book's jacket design by David Bullen as first rate.)"
5,A Talent To Be Reckoned With...,This album and band is without a doubt the greatest Australian musical achievement in decades..if not forever.
5,The new AWESOME!,"Will keep it short. I agree with everything everyone else has said in their reviews. I've seen the band a few times live, they are superb. I'm actually going to see them in Melbourne, Australia tonight.Australian album and band of the year without a doubt!"
4,We are Cog. Who are you?,"I concur with the other reviewers, but could have done with a little more light and shade. What we have here is a power trio who play like it is external sex organ cutting time as heavy as anything with a few lighter touches such as the intro to track 7. A passing whisper of Spy Vs Spy aside, comparisons being odious, this band bears a passing one to the Experience of Ultimate Mystic Yore without the air, hippie clothes and early effect pedals. The whole thing is polished and raw at the same time, capable of gear stripping changes in midstream, monstrous skills, seamless production values and philosophical lyrics. The big phat sound says hear me out and turn me up and to hear is to obey."
1,misleading title,"My own fault, I guess. I saw the title, and missed the little ""2x6"". Of course, there's no picture. What you get is 3 little plastic frames that hold 5 quarters each. The 2 x 6 refers to 2 inches by 6 inches long. Might be nice if you are collecting New England state quarters only, but a far cry from 50 states.It's junk, the name is misleading, and the lack of a picture is probably no accident."
5,Highly Recommend It,"If you or someone you know has ADHD, then you really need to read this book. Dr. Zentall has devoted her career to researching children with ADHD. Her findings have helped us develop a greater understanding of the challenges and gifts of people on the high end of the ADHD continuum. She explains how their attention and behavior is prompted by biological needs and offers more adaptable ways of meeting those needs. All teachers really need to read this book.This books is a compact synthesis of years of research on ADHD written by a renowned expert in the field. It has evidence-based strategies and explanations for why certain strategies work and others don't. The book is written at an academic level but could be easily read and understood by parents, teachers, and graduate students. I have read it cover to cover and I highly recommend it."
2,Zzzzzz,"As an educator, if you can wade through the language, there are some good nuggets of information and helpful suggestions. However, it is a very dry,incredibly boring read. I was forced to read cover to cover for a graduate level class, or I probably would have stopped after the first chapter and just used the index."
2,A Convoluted Story,"The illustrations are good, but the story leaves little to be remembered. There is so little story to this story, that the illustrations are the only worthy feature.It's about the giants who stole Lord Buckley, crowned him their king and took him to their home, where he was lonely, he sends a message to his home, where Sir Joshua comes to the rescue,etc., etc.,etc. The story reads like the preceding run-on sentence. Look to other books for childrens reading."
3,"Big book but, not worth big price.","I purchased this book in 1995 for $... I do not see how people can rationalize asking $... to $... for it. Yes, there are a lot of practice tests to take but, you have to remember 33% of the book is now obsolete. There is no analytical section in the new GRE CAT so you will not benefit from that portion of the book. If you are going to study for the GRE you need to familiarize yourself with the computer adaptive test.This book is helpful but, it's also 8 years old. There is more up to date material out there."
4,A damn good book,"If you want to spend $900 on taking Kaplan or Princeton Review course, I would suggest you to spend time on this book seriously. And use your extra money ($900 - $24) to get yourself some beer !"
3,Good practise for verbal section,"Like most international students, I had trouble with preparation for the verbal section and this helped in a lot. It gave me good practice in vocab and speed for reading comprehension and sentence completion particularly. Also it helped me apply the techniques prescribed in GRE kaplan's verbal workbook and princeton GRE Verbal workout for all sections of the verbal. But for math and analytical, it is very easy and out dated."
1,Disappointed,"I read the reviews (2)and decided to throw out the bad and give it a try. It arrived quickley but after setting it up, drilling a hole in my cabinet for power, I found out that the cold water did not work. I called customer service, Canada, waited on the phone for 20 mins. and was told that I had to deal with Amazon since I bought it there. I was requesting to repair the thermostat myself if they sent me the part. No luck. I sent it back. Amazon made sending and receiving easy. That was the only good thing with this whole excercise."
2,Bad after taste,"I ordered this cooler approx. one month ago. It functions fine mechanically, however the water it dispenses has a foul ""plastic"" type taste. I flushed both hot and cold water through this cooler (approx. 10 gallons) and the water still tasted bad. I am in the process of sending back this cooler but I am afraid to get another one for fear of the same problem. I have to think about my next move."
1,Thisty in New York,"Well, my Milano water cooler functioned fine for about a year and a half. All of a sudden, we were not getting any cold water. The following week, we couldn't get any hot water. I was doing research online to find out who the manufacturer was so I could get the unit repaired or replaced (I now know it's Addico) and after reading all the negative reviews, I decided just to throw it away and get a new water cooler from a reputable manufacturer!"
2,Leaking Cooler,I bought this cooler from Costco last year. I enjoyed it until it started to leak about a month ago. I tried calling the toll free number only to find out it was a porn number. I would like to get the cooler repaired. Does anyone have any suggestions?Dorothy
2,Think Again,"Loved the product when I got it because of ease of use. I broke both my hands several times, so I don't have much strength in them. I bought this product 8/08, it broke 10/08. I use cracked pepper in everything, the one ""ear"" is not made for continuous heavy use, it snapped. I was not rough with it as I don't have the strengthin my hands, but it did get heavy use. If you are a light user I would highly recommend this. If your a heavy user, forget it."
1,For as long as it lasted,"It was a great grinder as long as it lasted. I used a couple of weeks and the stationary handle snapped off. It still works if I hold the ball and move the brind handle, but I'll be looking for a new grinder."
3,Chef'n Pepper ball NOT as pictured,"Chef'n Pepper Ball-Grinder in Smoke and BlackWhen I ordered this item it was pictured with a base to sit on as is the one in the link. I wrote Amazon and they were quick to send me another one WITHOUT the base. Amazon has now changed the image to reflect the pepper mill without a base. I would rather have the one with a base, but I cannot get Amazon to understand what it is I am talking about. As far as the pepper mill is concerned, it is OK. The best I can say about it is that it can be used with one hand."
2,A unecessary gimmick,"For some reason when I saw this, I thought I needed it. I thought I'd actually need to grind pepper with one hand while stirring with the other. Turns out, I didn't.The levers have kind of a mushy feel to them and don't take any less hand strength to squeeze than twisty a well-made traditional pepper mill. For people who have serious hand strength issues, a top quality battery operated mill is the way to go. The grind is too coarse and comes out in a wide swath. The overall piece in thin plastic that seems destined to melt if placed too close to the stove.After about a year I donated it to charity and purchased a traditional style William Bounds stainless steel mill. It's much better."
3,"Effective, but almost impossible to clean","While convenient, effective, and easy to use, this pepper ball is a serious pain to keep clean. The interior quickly gets coated with pepper dust, ruining an otherwise-stylish appearance (but I can't blame the mill for generating pepper dust). There are parts of the interior which cannot easily be accessed at all. Still, pepper dust and crumbs seem to accumulate there. To really give it a satisfactory cleaning, one needs to remove the cover completely - and when you do so it becomes clear that such an action was never intended by the manufacturer.This is a handy item for use in the kitchen while cooking, but I wouldn't put mine out before guests."
2,Waste of time and money,Ours has stopped working in a matter of months.Instead spend your money on a pepper mill with the Danish ceramic mechanism with a lifetime guarantee.
1,The Pepper Ball,Product works well and for the price is probably OK. We have gone through two of them now. The plastic handles break off after 6 months. If you want something inexpensive then it is a reasonable buy but be prepared to replace it frequently.
1,Might be fun but not that functional,"This is another dust collector. I thought it was awesome when I first got it and even recommended it to my parents. After about 6 months of use, I began to realize how stupid and useless it really was. My problem was I had replaced my traditional peppermill with this pepperball, so I forgot that peppermills aren't that bad. The amount of effeort it takes to get a minimal amount of pepper out of one of these is amazing. It might not be effort but time. I personally believe that a good pepper mill works better, especially the courseness adjustment. It's a novelty item that doesn't have staying power. If you hate the traditional peppermill, then this might be for you. Otherwise, you might just want to stick with the traditional pepper mills since they do work fairly well."
2,Died Too Soom,"I've been very pleased with this mill for 2 years. Yesterday, one of the ears broke off in my hand."
2,Not what I hoped for.,I bought one of these pepper mills at Cost Plus with the intent of replacing our current pepper mill which ground the pepper very finely and wasn't adjustable. I am sorry to say it didn't live up to my expectations. The courseness of the pepper was too my liking but the handles lacked the ridgidness I expected and always felt like they would break instead of just flex.Another problem was the inconsistency with the amount of pepper that would come out with each squeeze. Sometimes you would get an adequate amount and other times hardly any pepper at all. This was the biggest drawback for me since I love pepper in my cooking and at the table. My wife was even more unhappy with it and recently it disappearred so I am looking to buy another one.
2,pepperball + hand cramp + soup = new pepper mill,"I agree with all the previous reviews: it's a cute, but largely ineffectual device. It would be fine for a person (say, my mom) who has a pretty kitchen but doesn't use pepper all that much.But for anyone who really likes to cook, because it takes so many squeezes to get a decent amount of pepper out of it, woe to anyone who happens to get a hand cramp while flavoring a big pot of soup! For the record, pepperball does not take kindly to oily, wet, soup baths. I'll be asking for a new, different, mill for my birthday this year..."
1,Bad Bunny,"My daughter bought this pepper mill for me. It's really cute and handy, but it doesn't work. Unless you're using it for decoration, you'll be disappointed."
4,Don't underestimate the one-handed convenience!,"How many times are you holding your plate of food in one hand but still need two hands to grind pepper? Ok I guess, if I wasn't so hungry, I could take a second to put my plate down and grind with two hands, but really - which method are you going to appreciate when you are starving?I first bought a Pepper Ball for myself to check the quality (good) and then one for my mom and sister as gifts. The Pepper Ball makes a great gift to which most people will figure out just how convenient it is after just a few uses.I am not worrying about the Pepper Ball only lasting a few years. I've seen some pretty expensive grinders stop working after a few years and feel that because of the the low price of a Pepper Ball, lasting more than five years is a moot point."
2,Handle Snapped Off,"I have had this for about six months. It sits by the stove, and gets used regularly. One of the handles snapped off. It went in the garbage. It replaced one I had for years, for which I cannot find a replacement."
2,"Owned, used and broken!","I have now owned two sets of these, both of which have broken after only a year or two of use. Whilst I was happy with both the design and operation of the product, I now have to replace both the salt and pepper grinder as the handles broke off each within a matter of days of one other (which is exactly what happened to my first set of these).I will not be buying another set of these as although they look good they will break again. I just hope the other products from the manufacturer are of a better build quality!"
4,"It broke, but I'm buying another one !","This is the first pepper grinder that I have ever owned that doesn't leave a little pile of ground pepper wherever you set it. The squeeze handles have excellent control, BUT... one of the handles broke. But you know what ? I'm buying another because it works so great !"
2,"Great idea, bad execution.",These look great stove-side but they clog and really don't grind pepper well at all. I always toss this down in frustration and pick up my standard mill off the table. Nice idea but lousy execution. They could not have possibly tested this product for any length of time before they produced it. I fat fingered a star and should have only given this one for esthetics.
1,Flimsy construction,"I used this pepper mill for several months in moderate home use. Here is why I would not buy another one:- Black handle broke under normal use, rendering it useless.- Small output per squeeze.- Plastic grind mechanism that probably will not last long.So, I would not recommend buying this unit, although it is comfortable and easy to use for the possibly short time it might last.I'm going to try the Unicorn Peppergun."
1,Broke within 1 month,This is the second pepper mill I bought from this manufacturer and both broke at the plastic handles while using. Not good pepper output either. A waste of money. TWICE!
2,Underwhelming!,"This mill had some real issues:1) It didn't hold its' grind setting very well2) It didn't produce much ground pepper per squeeze, so it took a looooong time to get much from it.3) After several months of use, the handle broke, making it a trash ornament.Other than that, though, it was fine. :-("
2,"Handle broke, grind too coarse","I thought a one-handed pepper grinder would be great for cooking, but I was never able to get the grind adjusted, and you don't get enough ground pepper per squeeze, and now one of the handles has snapped off. I won't be getting another one of these.The salt grinder version is fine, though."
2,Buy the disposable mill & pepper in condiment section,"It may be good for people with weak hands...as long as they don't really want a lot of pepper. I found the amount of pepper ground per squeeze minimal. My hand gets tired before I get an amount ground equivalent to two twists on a $2.59 self-contained pepper with disposable mill from the condiments section of any grocery store. Half of the pepper stays in the ball to fill the grinder teeth and further reduce the output.Although advertised as a one hand pepper mill, it is best used as a two handed device. The squeezing action tends to broadcast the ground pepper over a wide area. If you wish to concentrate in a bowl or on a food item, one hand has to steady it over your target.Refill is a challenge and equivalent time is spent picking up pepper corns that bounce off the small, almost perfectly hidden fill slot.Again style overrides functionality."
2,Not for lasting quality,"I've had my Chef 'N pepper ball for about 5 years now. I use it many times every day, and it has been the sole pepper grinder that I have used during this time. For the last 3 years, it has not performed well. I paid about $20.00 for it when I bought it. I'd say that it performed adequately for the first couple of years (not great, but OK). However, the grinding mechanism, which looks kind of like a plastic washboard, has worn smooth over the years. Now, it seems to take forever to grind a half-teaspoon of pepper (5 minutes, last time I counted). It only grinds when set at the coarsest setting (fine setting never worked well, even when new).On the plus side - it was less expensive than other pepper grinders and was easy to use one-handedly."
1,Cheap piece junk,"This grinder is almost entirely made of cheap plastic, and does not grind well. In order to fill it you have to slide a piece of plastic along the side that it held in place by nothing other than friction and a tight fit with the case, which is also where the two side of the container come together. Within 2 month, the bond between the two side of the container suddenly loosened while in use and dumped peppercorns everywhere. It is pretty much unusable at this point."
2,This was great while it lasted!,I bought this for my husband - who loves to cook & this was something he really wanted. He used it everyday & after a month the handles broke off. I think it should be made better.
2,Great Idea with design flaw,"This is our second pepper ball and I will be getting a third. You can't beat the coarse grind the pepper balls make. However, they seem to break easily. The plastic on the ball broke on the first one. The handle on this brand broke while I was grinding. I think this is poor engineering. My advice is go with the cheapest and figure you're going to have to replace it within a year."
1,awful buy,brought this because I thought that it would be more efficient to use just one hand to grind pepper. Also it was cute. But I had it for less then 3 weeks and the handle broke off like another reviewer on her said. The handle is very flimsy because its made of plastic. So with the more use the more likely it will not with stand the pressure.So now I cannot even use it because one of the handle broke.
3,OPC Belt,Not happy about having to spend more money on the already expensive copier but Amazon was best price and got it here next day so I am back in business. Recommend searching here before purchasing anything.
1,telescop,"I bought this item directly from Orion to power my Meade LX 200 GPS telescope. I bought it in mid-season and I couldn't use it because I needed to order a special DC adaptor from Meade. As a result of the delays I never even got to use it. I was charged it up and it sat for almost year inmy closet without being used.When I got it out to ues it, it was, of course drained so I tried to recharge it. It was totslly dead and wouldn't accept a charge or even show any signs of accepting currant. Since their return warranty is only good for 30 days there is no recourse as a customer. I paid almost a hundred and twenty dollars for this door stop and feel like I got ripped off, big-time. I'm going to call Orion and see if they'll stand behind their product but I'm not hopeful, considering the time that has passed."

GENERALLY, ALL OF THE STORIES ARE SAD, MELANCHOLY, DEPRESSING, AND DISHEARTENING. NOT A LOT HAPPENS IN EACH STORY, BUT THE AUTHOR CONVEYS HIS VERY PESSIMISTIC OUTLOOK ON LIFE. ALTHOUGH THE STORIES PORTRAY UNHAPPY, ANGRY PEOPLE,AND DISTRESSING LIFE CIRCUMSTANCES, I DO RECOMMEND READING THESE BEAUTIFULLY WRITTEN GEMS OF LITERATURE."
5,Must have book for Grenadine sailors,I used this book more than the charts. The information is up-to-date and accurate. Don't go sailing with out it.J. Lemke
1,Disappointed,The matter of fact approach in this book leaves a lot to be desired. I was hoping this would be a fun spooky read for Halloween with the kids. The 10 O'clock news has more flair and drama than this book. I'll keep searching for something more entertaining.
2,let down,I liked the book but I guess I was expecting more of a spine- tingling experience. I wanted to get scared while reading and that definitely did not happen. Entertaining though.
2,Too Many Examples from B & B Inns,"As a member of the Fort Huachuca community, I was rather proud to see our own Charlotte as one of the featured ghosts but, on reading further and finding that some places earned mention of multiple ghosts, I wondered why mention was only made of the white woman Charlotte and not the Buffalo Soldier in the DoC office, which used to be the barracks for the 9th Cavalry, or the Buffalo Soldier who haunts the restaurant that used to be the local bordello. As I read further, however, I started to notice that the greatest majority of ghost stories WERE from Bed and Breakfast Inns or Restaurants or other public places that might find financial benefit from being mentioned in a book about hauntings. At this point, I began to become disillusioned about the stories."
3,Disturbing,"This is a semi popular occult book with the Quaker religion, about ghost haunting stories from all 50 states and Canada. Gone is the childlike spooks of ghosts and in is the very adult idea of ghost hunting. The common ghost will easily vanish and perish with the flash of even the smallest crucifix symbol. The only real disturbing thing was that this was made by Quakers. It runs the gamut- this is the occult of Christianity, and is still shunned by the conservative right wing. The occult in Christianity is what the right wing doesn't want you to know."
5,Great tool,"I bought this tool 6 months ago, and it is very useful. Ifind that the clips work very well. much better than the dewalt, whosclip snapped on me, and also the all ball bearing construction unlike the roller bearings found in most dewalt tools.It is very light and fits in your hand nicely.It has lasted me quite a few sandings so far, having no problems or bizzare noises so far.The dust collection also works great.It sucks up about 80 percent of the saw dust and the rest is scatted away from the work space."
4,reliable and easy to use,"In retrospect, I'm not sure why I bought this sander. It is meant to be used as a finish sander to sand between coats of paint, varnish, etc. or in preparation of painting. For large areas it works well in this regard. However, for smaller jobs, it is easier to simply sand by hand rather than get this tool out, load it with paper, and punch dust collection holes in it. I prefer my 6 inch random orbit sander because it can be used for more aggressive sanding as well as finish sanding. The only advantages of this tool are its lighter weight and ability to sand in corners. If you wish to own just one sander, then I would get a random orbit type."
3,Not Bad,"I've owned this sander for a couple years now. It's not too bad. In my experience, it clips the sandpaper very well. The dust collector is ok...but not all that. Just a guess, but I'll say, it collects about half of the dust it sands off. That was one of the main reasons why I purchased it. I don't like the hard plastic collector either, since it tends to get in the way sometimes. It's definately great for drywall, since drywall sands easy.The case that comes with the sander [could be better] IMO. It leaves little room for the cord and I find myself having to force it close most of the time. Maybe I'm rushing, but that's what I noticed. Great price on this little sander though. It's very dependable and has served me well.I, like the other guy noted, prefer a random orbital sander for most of my sanding needs. It just takes off a lot more, a lot quicker (I have the DeWalt DW421 for that)."
2,Too many swirls!,"I bought this sander because of the ""dustless"" feature to replace my 1/4 sheet Makita that is over 10 years old. Unfortunatly, the feature I bought it for seems to cause swirls on the wood. I'm doing a reproduction corner shelf of cherry and noticed them before I applied the oil finish. I believe the cause is probably the ragged edges produced by the paper punch supplied with the machine. I suppose you could buy factory punched paper which would have a tapered edge on the abrasive but that would be more costly. For a painted finish the sander does produce a nice finish, my work is custom furniture and I use a trademark, hand rubbed oil finish so this is unacceptable to my level of quality."
4,"reliable, effective sander","I've had this sander for at least 5 years, and used it a great deal in that time (mostly sanding wood).Pros:o lightweight, well balanced.o ruggedo excellent for rounding over edges and smoothing woodo reasonably aggressive sanding considering it's size and weighto fairly easy to install and remove sandpaper using metal spring-clipso comes with hole puncho reasonably good dust collectionCons:o noisyo short cordOverall this is model 340 sander is a very nice machine.Recommended."
1,Terrible product,Sander leaves swirles. Harder to insert new paper than most - in my old Mikita I could do it with 1 hand - this takes 3. Dust collector is hard and therefore restricts sander positioning.
2,Swirls and caked dust,"After realizing that this sander makes the nicest little ""r"" shaped swirls, I relegated it to the light sanding of paints and primers, between coats. The problem now is that the paint dust clogs inside sander, never making it into the attached dust canister. Even with the dust canister completely removed, paint dust still collects inside and is not properly expelled. Obviously, this requires constant cleaning with an air hose coupled with a heavy ""tapping"" on the exhaust port with my hammer handle to help dislodge the caked dust. Hopefully, it will die soon from my endless tapping so that I can buy another, this time from a different manufacturer."
2,"sheetrocker, painter","the 340 sander is not a professional tool at all.I have stopped buying them after 6 in two years. The lower bearing is a constant problem, especially with sheetrock. The dust has also wore holes in two of my housings,[ where you connect the vacuum hose]. I use a vacuum 100% of the time, dust bags and canisters just dont work. The pad is also another very weak point if you use self stick paper, after your first paper change, you will surly tear the pad apart.The 330 is the sander they should have made dustless."
3,Smooth tool but it died early!,"I use the 340 in a commercial woodcraft shop and have the ""Stick-It"" PSA sand paper system. For a production application where you need to replace sand paper frequently this is an excellent set up. Just pull out the length of paper you need ,tear it off the dispenser and literally stick it on the sander to keep on sanding. No slow and tedious fiddling with clamping devices.The 340 is very smooth and fairly quiet and I have been using it for over two years with only one replacement PSA pad necessary. My 340 does have one unnerving characteristic, it changes speed randomly as you use it. Its never stopped working but sometimes it makes you wonder.( Well, the 340 came to a slow stop and was replaced with a Makita B4550, my second- the first is still running well after 9 years)"
3,Stop bowing to the stereotypes - and CHANGE THE RULES!,"Although Hollands book may move some women's careers forward, she is also setting back most women in all fields a few dozen years! Equal opportunity for women is still a long way off. Each time a woman succumbs to theories like Hollands' ''bully broads,'' she not only halts progress, she takes a giant step into the past. The challenge is to speak out about gender discrimination, not bow to it. The challenge is to rid the workplace of stereotypes -- not pay homage to them. Until we do, executive women will still be called ""bully broads,"" while men are applauded for their aggressive, take-charge business style! (Marion E. Gold is author of ""Personal Publicity Planner: A Guide to Marketing YOU,"" and ""TOP COPS: Profiles of Women in Command."""
1,I Woulnd't Recommend It!,"I purchased these (at a local store, not at Amazon) because of the attractive price and the claimed 12dB reduction. Well, I got What I payed for. It made more static noise than audible noise reduction when using them alone and with an MP3 Player. Returned them for my Money Back the next day."
1,Don't waste your money.,"The noise cancellation simply doesn't work. The previous comment aboutBose headphones is true; you will hear things around you such as conversations, but at least they partially cancel out continuous noise (i.e. periodic tones like machinery). These headphones do absolutely nothing in that regard. Don't buy these."
1,These f***ing suck,"ok first, i actually would have gave it less then 1 star, the little battery pack on the cord is annoying when your at a desk trying to work and study it gets hung under the edge of the desk, and the sound is horrible, it sounds like its being blured, or faded real thick sound, even you change your eq setting it doesn;t help much if at all, my $2.50 ear buds sound better then this thing, and for 40 dollars its not worth it and complete waste of money and time. The only way to cancel out noise is to turn the volume up as much as possible and still then you here noise not to mention the speakers shake and distort even at half your computers volume, again not worth the money at all. i might buy another pair if they were 4 or 5 dollars because thats about all there worth."
3,Rocksteady at its finest,"Bangnrang 1962-72 is a masterpiece, Stranger Cole at his best. I grew up in this era of music that I enjoy so so much and thought it would be impossible to find this kind of music, So I check Amazon.Com and they came through,Big Up Amazon from now onI'll call you AMAZING.COM. I also bought Derrick Morgan's Moon Hop 1960-68,Slim Smith's Keep That Love Light Shining,The Heptones 20 Golden Hits,The Melodians River Of Babylon,The Techniques Run Come Celebrate and Six The Hard Way.Amazon you make me a happy man.Ten Stars to You,I'm your customer for life."
5,Get This Album,"This other guy is full of crap, this is a masterpiece of the golden era of ska and rocksteady by one of the most gifted singers from the island. If you can get this for less than 20 bucks do it. it is rare and out of print material that you will never find on cd. 5 stars Jamaican Superstar"
2,"DOC HOLLYWOOD MEETS 10,000 MANIACS","Brothers Josh (Wings Hauser) and Mike (Lee Montgomery) get stranded in a small southern town after a run-in with some locals on the highway. The town has been experiencing illness and disappearances. There is a biological/chemical facility nearby.The mutants are not scary by modern standards. The opening credits has ""Special Guest Appearance by Jennifer Warren"" like they did for old TV shows. Indeed, this movie looks like it was made for TV down to the sound track, which may or may not have been better than the bad ""Tempe Video"" style I expected. The build up to the mutant scenes was better than the mutants themselves. I got bored at that point.Fired lush Sheriff Bo Hopkins delivers comedy: ""Proof? I got proof. I got 86 proof."" That is about as good as it gets.Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. Fairly lame in adult material. I imagine the ""R"" rating is for the ""horror"" aspect."
1,ITEM IS DISCONTINUED AND OUT OF STOCK,"Why, oh why are these people still listing this product?When you order, you will wait 1 1/2 weeks, and then you will receive an email from both Amazon and the Devita saying that this product is no longer made by the manufacturer, and that they are canceling your order.How can I not see this listing as dishonest, or maybe just plain lazy? Why would they force you to go through the buying process and wait 1 1/2 weeks before telling you that this product is not and will never be available, when they could just......remove the listing?Perhaps it's because the manufacturer can't come to terms with the fact that they're going out of business...?"
2,"No pull tab, short glue","There is no pull tab for opening! There's one pictured in the photo but the actual mailers I received don't have one. So it's a real bother for the recipient to open. And the glue to seal it doesn't quite cover enough of the flap. It'll work but I end up adding tape to seal it closed.If I didn't need these the day they arrived to send out a large mailing, I would've returned them for a refund.Depending on your use, these may work for you. I was relying on the photo and description of a ""tear tab for easy opening"" because I am sending these out to paying clients and I really need good packaging. Reading the reviews here, someone said there wasn't a strip under the tear tab. What I received didn't have a tear tab at all, never mind a strip under it.It is white paperboard, which is easy to store and easy to address. This packaging is a ""C-"" or a ""D+"" and I needed an ""A."" Gotta spend more to get what I want."
2,"Fine, until you try to open one.","I was very happy with these (bought from barbjewel), and mailed them to dozens of customers. Today though I sealed and then tried to open one. There is no reinforcement on the tab strip, so when you grab on one of the ends to tear, a 1/4"" piece just tears off. As a result, getting the mailer open is quite a challenge, without tearing it to pieces or using a cutter. I tried a second one and had the same issue.This doesn't leave a good first impression with my customers."
3,Decent product...,"These envelopes do the trick, but they are not as sturdy as brands I've purchased in the past and the adhesive strip is difficult to remove (esp. if you have short finger nails!). The overall feeling is cheap and I wouldn't purchase again."
3,"A new photo, please","The envelopes are OK considering the cheap price. But Amazon, you need to take a new photo that shows the lack of a tear-tab at the flap, as previous reviewers have noted. Also, you should say that the open measurement is 6 x 6 3/4 while the sealed measurement is a square 6 x 6. The USPS requires a fairly steep, first class postage rate for a square rigid envelope containing a disc. What you save on the envelope you'll spend on the postage. I hope that the 150 or so discs I plan to mail this week will make it to their recipients safely."
3,Item Great. Slow shipping,"This fits the bill for mailing CD's or DVD's. I was hoping to reduce my postage cost by not having to pay package rates. But the USPS said that since they were rigid, they still went at the package rate. Love the self seal flap. I like it better than a bulky padded envelope for photos and CDs. Shipping/delivery was slow from the seller I ordered from."
3,Not as sturdy as I had hoped for.,"They are the right size. The sticky flap is nice so you don't have to use packing tape.My only complaint is that these are very thin. I am selling CD's on Ebay and I worry about them getting broken in transit. I really don't feel comfortable using these alone, as I can't imagine the jewel case not getting cracked in shipment. I would not purchase these again. I was trying to save a few pennies and now it will end up costing me more in the long run. I think I'll go back to the padded envelopes that have bubble inside."
3,"quality fine, description misleading","The quality is fine; buit it was described as 6 by 6 and 3/8 inches in size, and in fact, with the flap closed, it's 6 by 6 inches, which makes it more expensive in postage, sending by U.S. mail, because it is a square shaped envelope."
5,The Best Romantic Comedy of the Year,"I love this book! Whitney Gaskell is a great story-teller, and hysterically funny as well. Ellie Winters (the heroine of Pushing 30) is original, authentically rendered and very likable. Unlike a lot of books these days, this one has a real story to it -- and it hooked me from the very first page. I laughed out loud several times, and couldn't put it down until I reached the very end. It was a real joy to read. I am looking forward to snapping up Gaskell's next offering."
4,fun,"the purpose of chick lit is to read for fun and entertainment. Most plots are predictable and characters are seterotypical. this book is no different. you'l know the story from start. read it only if u want a light read. if your looking for something denser with more sustance and intellectual stimulation, this is not it. well, chick is not it then."
3,cute but predictable,"This book was typical of the genre, but still fun to read. I loved her take on the May-December romance, and also liked the relationship Ellie had with her brother (written very realistically). One thing that got me was how does a blonding kit turn light brown hair pink? My hairstylist friend harped on that bit for days on end. Fact checking is your friend you know. Also, why didn't Ellie's law office nemesis not get her comeuppance? If you're going to paint such an evil antagonist, the reader usually wants to see them get what's coming to them.Still, not a bad way to pass a rainy day or two."
2,not great,"Ellie was OK, Ted might as well have been a cardboard cut-out. It was hard to focus on the plot, because it was so obvious that this writer knew nothing at all about Washington DC. Try reading it as though it's set in NYC and it makes so much more sense."
1,Very disappointing,"This book could have been written by a high school student-- the plot was *totally* predictable, the characters underdeveloped and stereotyped, the dialogue lame. It also had a pretentious quality that was hard to stomach. Very unsatisfying, even for a light beach read."
5,Cute & Durable,"I bought this for my grandaughter. She loves it. I had purchased Melissa & Doug toys before & this one is great, like all their other toys."
4,Very cute but not for my son - UPDATED,"This toy is really cute. Each animal makes a different noise and has different fabrics to give it texture. Unfortunately, my 5-month-old son is not at all interested in it. Hopefully this will change.Update: My son is now 12 months old, and this toy is much more popular now. He loves to pull each piece out one by one and then stuff them back in and do it all over again. I have up'd my rating to 4 stars now. It's still not a 5-star, but that's because our son is not really into soft toys; in fact, this is the only soft toy he will play with."
1,"opening too small to ""spill""","This would be a great toy if the opening was larger, right now I have to shake it ALOT to get the toys to spill out, no way a baby could do it."
3,"Cute toy, but can't ""spill"" the toys out","The little toys are cute and my 4 month old loves them, but the top of the fishbowl is too narrow to ""spill"" the toys out as the name implies. In fact, I had a hard time getting the toys out through the top. Maybe an older baby can get them out. The toys are machine washable, which is a plus, and they make cute sounds so they keep my baby's attention."
3,Great idea,"This is a gret toy, primary colors, different object shapes, they can practice putting into and taking out of the ""fish bowl"". Each toy has a different sound, the fish is crinkley, the octopus rattles, the starfish squeaks etc.. My only complaint is that they collect lint like crazy and its hard to clean the lint off, especially important be ause baby puts these right in their mouth."
5,Toy Parents and Babes Love,"Great quality, easy to clean. Vivid colors with sounds and textures. My two year old is often found trying to snatch from the baby. I also love that it does not have an excess of plastic and batteries as so many kid toys have."
3,a matter of taste,"So, I loved this toy, I thought it was the cutest thing. Alas, my son has never really played with it. He's more of a ""wooden-toy"" kid, he has never really gravitated to anything soft. But if your child likes soft toys, give this a whirl. It's well-made, durable, and the characters all make different noises. You have to push and pull to get the animals in and out of the fishbowl - it takes a bit of force."
3,Not a favorite,"My 6 month old daughter got this fishbowl toy for for Christmas and received the Melissa and Doug Bug Jug a couple weeks before. She loves Bug Jug, is fascinated by the container and the bugs are her favorite toys. I would have returned the fishbowl but return shipping was $8 so thought I'd give it a try, but my daughter just isn't interested. The fish aren't as well done as the bugs, they're much plainer and don't have the limbs/antennae to grab onto. I think the fish could have been made more interesting with patterns, fins, etc. The bowl annoys me because both ends look the same and I always try to shove a fish in the wrong end. There just appear to be cuter fishbowl toys out there, and my daughter definitely prefers her Bug Jug."
2,Not Very Interesting,"the sea creatures are cute, but not very entertaining, doesn't hold the attention. I thought it was a little overpriced for what I received"
3,Aesthetic Appeal Only,"I received the iPod socks free with a $30 off coupon from Apple, and I immediately fell in love with them. They're not as thick as I had hoped, but they are still thicker than the average pair of people socks. I have found that the socks also work quite well for cell phones. If you want to protect your iPod from being banged around, this is not the case for you. If you're looking for something to keep your iPod scratch free inside your purse, gym bag, or coat pocket you have got to get the socks!"
3,I have an alternative...,"My son has some little socks that he's already outgrown- they make great covers for my 3rd Gen iPod Nano- cheap, and cute, too!"
1,"2 stars for cuteness, 0 stars for usefulness...","Well, I guess I really don't get the point. If you don't want your iPod scratched w/use, put it in a case. Then it's covered WHILE you're using it and you can still work all the buttons. With this, you slide the bare-naked iPod out to use it - risking scratches from the sock itself and from dropping the iPod while it's out of the sock. I was hoping it would be large enough to slide my iPod into while it's in its case and hold one of those tiny thumbtack microphones so I wouldn't lose it. But my iPod nano 4th gen hangs out of it 1/4"" when it's not in its case. So I'd risk the end getting scratched up and it's not long enough to close, so if it were in my pocket or purse it'd slip right out and....get scratched. So, again, what is the point?? I'm just glad I spent $2.78 on the set on eBay instead of paying Apple's price..."
2,Forgive me 4 my ignorance.....,"I first saw them i thought maybe (atleast!0 they had a cutout for the screen or SOMETHING for 29.00 that was not simply slipping a sock onto a iPod. Unfortunately, I was unpleasantly surprised. Its a god-frosaken sock! for 29.00? Gimme a Break! Got get a needle, a piece of fabric, and sew it yourself! And if your not quite THAT creative, go buy a colored sock!"
1,KINGS OF MARKETING!!!,"I have to hand it to Apple, they can charge $30 for a pair of socks an people buy them! Amazing! I'll just cut up my new gym socks instead."
3,ipod socks semi-practical and cute.,"OK, it's designed for people who have money to burn but they do keep your ipod protected from scratches and nicks when you have it in your pocket...to carry a ""naked"" ipod in your coat pocket while you stroll around is stupid because anything could get to it or get inside the charging cavity.(...)They are fun and I use mine all the time. (...)"
3,iPod soc- cute but useful,"I brought this product at the suggestion of a co-worker. While it is very cute and you could accessorize it with everything, I found that you could actually use it with other gadgets than just the iPods themselves.I use it for my Sprint (slimfit phone), and a Treo Palm etc... The downside is there is no way to keep it from sliding out or changing programs on any product. It does wear and it will fade. Needless to say, I am happy that I brought it and if you are looking for a cute way to ""snazzy up"" your phones or iPods this is the way to go."
4,Great product for the price,I purchased the set for myself and my daughter (21 years old). She and I both loved them. They are stylish and keep your IPOD from scratching.
3,NOT EXACTLY WHAT I EXPECTED,"I have heard so much about Carol's Daughter's products and I had been wanting to try something from the line. I am African American and I do hair professionally. I have very long thick hair that constantly needs moisture. I want to address the smell : It is very VERY bold. It is not so much unpleasant as it is loud. If I were sensitive to smells I'd definitely have a problem with this product. I would apply it on a weekend so that it would calm down before returning to work. It doesn't really do a whole lot for my hair unless my hair is wet and the instructions is for it to be applied to the scalp---but I don't like clogging my scalp with ointments. It works really well on my daughter's hair and her hair is finer and a smoother texture than mine. I don't really see the benefit for people with TRULY ""nappy"" hair to use this. I will probably continue to buy for my children and for me to use after a shampoo."
3,Just......ok.....,"I've tried multiple Carol's Daughter products and for me, each of them has been kind of hit or miss. I'm in love with the Mimosa Hair Honey and the entire Tui line, but there are a couple of products (Hair milk/Healthy Hair Butter) I've tried that weren't up to par with what I was hoping to get from them. I do love that the Healthy Hair Butter does a decent job at moisturizing my hair but the smell is pretty overwhelming..almost as if I crushed up a box of sandalwood fragranced insence and then rubbed it throughout my entire head. I paid a pretty penny for it though, so I'm going to try to stick it out and hopefully I'll get used to the smell. DEFINITELY not a product for someone with fragrance-induced allergies."
3,Feels good BUT just doesn't have the moisturizing effects desired,"I got this as a sample from Ricky's. I really wanted to buy the Miss Jessie's baby-butter cream, but decided to give this a shot.Ehhhh....I have really thick, coarse & mostly dry 4a/b type African American hair.My hair has been very dehydrated for the past few moths & breaking so I am still in pursuit of the right moisturizers and cleaners. =/Oh well, the Carol's Daughter hair butter smells great, feels great, but it doesn't moisturize for long unless I use a generous amount. Secondly, it does weigh down the hair.I have MIXED feelings. I think it works better on straight hair or hair types with loser curls. It just didn't really work for me!I will maybe try it again. I hope this helped.Peace & love!~Pepper"
2,Hair Cream,"This product smells great....and is a good product, but if you have extremely curly hair (and I mean Ophrah curly) the ojon treatment in a jar is far better in terms of giving your hair moisture and a good ""drink"" if it is really coarse and dry like mine is, but that smells like burnt coffee...still I use them both but have to say I prefer the Ojon products from QVC much more.Everyone's hair has different needs....just keep this in mind if you have hair that is as curly as mine."
1,The PH is crazy!!!!!,"I purchased this product and enjoyed the results as far as it making my hair more manageable....but I have to stop using it, after Iam finished the jar(cant afford to waste money). Iam into healthy natural black hair...my hair is 4a...thick and curly....this product is like giving my natural curls a perm. The PH in this product is 8.0....that's crazy. I dont know what secret ingredients they are putting in the healthy hair butter but its not good for your hair. Please carol..fix this so that the ph level is between 4-5.0, that's what a healthy product ph level should be at. The hair milk is a little better for the hair. It's level is at 6.0. I want to use Carol's products but I dont want to perm my curls."
3,stinks,"The smell of this product is strong. It can slick your hair down without the damaging of gels or hairspray and is a good conditioner for edges...it even lasts a long time, but Ihad to get rid of it because I couldnt stand the strong smell. I like the Elasta QP mango butter for the same effect."
5,First CD product I've tried..,It's amazing on my hair. A little goes a LONG way. I am Caucasian (just sayin) and I have 2c - 3a hair ( I believe ) its medium texture. I absolutely love the smell it is very earthy.
3,Review of Carol's Daughter Healthy Hair,"I thought CD Healthy Hair might do something different for my natural hair. I haven't noticed a difference yet. My hair is very dry and hard to manage. Then, I may have not used it long enough for it to make a difference.The item came just as listed on the website."
5,5 stars,I use this all the time on my hair. It feels really smooth and buttery. When I use it my hair stays moisturized all day even if I'm out in the heat/wind/cold...
3,It's ok,"I got 2 4-oz jars of this for free at the Carol's Daughter store when I spent over $150 there. I wasn't going to try it, but one day my hair was so very dry so I tried a dollop. I used too much, so it weighed my hair down. I tried it once more a different day, this time a VERY small amount, and it was far better. I have straight relaxed hair a little past my shoulders.So here's the deal - because it's so thick, you have to work with it to get the right amount to use in your hair. Because my hair is so thick and kind of long, I am used to using a lot of product to moisturize it properly. With this, I used the amount that can fit on the pads of two fingers (index and middle) and that was enough to moisturize my hair. The hair butter softened and moisturized my hair very nicely, but the potential for weighing it down and the precise science needed to get the right amount is kind of a turn off. Also, it smells pretty bad."
4,the smell is strong,"I bought this and the healthy hair butter for my own hair, but ended up selling it to my mom for her to use on my nephews' hair. It smells like a (very nice) men's fragrance to me, and the smell is very strong, but it is also very moisturizing and good for the hair, so i give it 4/5 stars."
2,meh...blah,"I tried to like this product that I got as part of the Carol's Daughter transitioning set. I wanted to like it but wasn't impressed. I've been using it one to two times per week with no noticeable results. It does not hydrate, soften, tame or strengthen. It does not even smell all that wonderful. While I didn't notice any detrimental effects, the product should be beneficial somehow...In sum, carefully consider all of the other better possibilities out there before choosing this expensive useless product."
3,nice product- just not for me,"It made my hair feel a little waxie. but it did give my curls great bounce!!I may use it again when i want my curls to really tighten up, but not for everyday use."
5,love love it,I love the product so far and have in between 4 b and 4c hair texture. My hair thick medium long very coarse very dry and thirsty requiring a lot of moisture however one application about one tablespoonful of this product deeply penetrates and conditions my hair all the way to the ends for three full days without a new application. Thank God after a lot of trial and error with many other brands...this is the only one thats ever really worked for me!
1,Not the best....,"Super greasy and didn't absorb into my hair, even though I used a tiny amount. Didn't like it so it was returned."
2,Ok but kind of disappointed,"Ive been hearing rave reviews about the Carol's daughter line for years. I decided to purchase this after relocating to the dry areas of California. Well I was disappointed with this product overall but I do understand how it can be a great product for some.I process my hair, so maybe this is why my experience has been a bit different than other reviewers. This stuff is pretty thick, smells awful, and doesnt add any shine to the hair. Oh did I say it smells awful?! I then zoomed in on the ingredients and noticed it had beeswax in it. Well Im sorry but beeswax is prettty heavy for my liking. I like moisture BUT also MOVEMENT, not a stiff drying looking, smelly hair. Plus I had to reapply this stuff the next day.To give you more insight on my hair and styling preference, I process my hair every 6 to 8 weeks. I wash my hair every 4 to 6 days. I sometimes let me hair air dry and will flat iron it at least once a week."
1,The Smell Is Awful!,I went to my local Sephora store to check out Carol's Daughter products for the 1st time. Some of the products had an OK smell but this was unbearable. I put a little tip on the back of my hand to get the full affect of the scent & after 3 hand washes the smell still lingers! It might actually be a good hair product but the smell is a turn off. I'm glad I had the opportunity to check the products out before purchasing online.
1,Pee u..What's that smell?,"I am transitioning from a relaxer to natural style and I had heard alot of great things about Carol's Daughter products. I guess that I should have listened to previous reviewers about the smell of this product. After getting over the smell, I tried it anyway to see if it worked better than it smelled. After one use, my hair actually looked and felt extremely hard and dry. I don't think that I will be using this product again. it definitely did not live up to the hype. Return to sender."
1,Product Desciptin is False and Misleading,"Despite the minimal product description, there is maximum misinformation.Product does NOT work on all Total Gym Models, and DOES require accessories. Be sure to buy hundres of dollars of thier stuff to use this."
4,Great Album,"I think this is a really great album which contains some of the Nena's Best Mixes. However, a great mix of the song 'Just a Dream - Megadream Mix' is missing on the compilation. The remix of this song is included in the album 'Nena - Die Band' [Japanese Edition] as bonus track, as well as '99 Red Balloons - Club Mix'. Unfortunately, the compilation could be better if they [Sony Music] really want it."
5,Quino a Gem!,"I won't be able to do justice with an eloquent review right now, but i can echo the sentiments expressed in another's (Ron A. Zajac, zajac@nortel.com), and mourn the lack of availability of this cartoonist's funny, poignant, and, ultimately, ineffable work. I love some of the acknowledged greats - herriman (and marquis!), kelly, suess (yes), etc. - and wish that someone situated to act on it would make this man's wonderful work available!"
5,Finally... A Chord Book for Spanish Speakers,This book is amazing! Chords and rhythms to traditional Latin American folk songs. I brought this book for my nephew and found his mother singing along to the CD. The chord symbols were in solfege and the traditional letter names used in the U.S. I was able to strum along and play the songs while my sister-in-law sang songs from her childhood and taught the lyrics to my 12-year-old nephew.We had a blast and now both my sister-in-law and nephew are learning how to play guitar.
5,its the best movie!its so so fuuny,its fun for the whole family.verybody would like it.its so so so funny when the lizard goes in to the persons mouth when the two twins put it on the water bottle!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4,New Vers. Parent Trap,"It's a cute movie for the family, I would recomend it and it's a better version than the older Parent Trap movie. Lindsy Lohan did a great job in this flick!"
5,It's great! I just love it!,"I really love this movie and I could see it a thousand more times.It's my favorite,and Linsay Lohan is really good!It's great for the family to enjoy together.It's absolutely much better than the first one,it is more lively and fun."
5,You can watch it over and over and never get tired of it!,"This movie was awesome! The best thing was it stuck pretty close to the same intentions of the first video. The ending is much clearer and exciting. It's good, clean fun. I really enjoyed this one - I hope you do too!"
2,GOT CHARGED... NEVER RECIEVED IT!!!!,STILL WAITING FOR RESPONSE FROM SELLER.... GOT CHARGED FOR THIS BUT DID NOT RECEIVE IT.
5,The Parent Trap is the best movie!!!!,I loved the parent trap. It was an awsome movie but Lohan siad some stupid things in the movie. Eliane was perfect for the part if Meredith Blake. The woman who works at Hallie's house is named Chessie NOT Jessie listen closer and when they are at camp it says CHESSIE. awesome!!!
3,See the Original Instead,"I've always loved the origninal movie, and was rather excited to finally see the new version, but was disapointed. Granted its cute, and maybe the original is a little less ""disney-esque"", but the original is so much better. The characters, the acting, the orginality... you can't beat the original. Still for a child, this works too. More a tv-movie."
3,"Enjoyable, but...","I have to say I prefer the original. This version is very well done, but it's a little too sexy for my kids, at least as it regards the new wife-to-be. Made me squirm when we all watched it.Lindsay Lohan was undeniably cute in this film, as was Dennis Quaid. And the way the story was tweaked was nice, a new twist. ButI'm very glad that we have the original on DVD, because we like it better."
5,WOW LOVED IT!!!!!,I am 13 and i still love to watch this movie. It is fun for the whole family. I still laugh hard durring parts of the movie even if I have seen it 1 million times.
4,good,I bought this movie because its a 90s classic and I couldn't find it anywhere for rent because it is so outdated. I wanted it to watch with my family and keep around since our last copy was a VHS. When the movie arrived it came in a box that wasn't in pristine condition. When I opened it the DVD fell out and had scratches on it. However I watched it with my family last night and we had no problems with it.
1,Camp Inch,"I HATE the new Parent trap.It's boring,useless and can't even compare with the original.Annie and Hallie's differences are only visible in the remake,if you look closely in the original you can see that Sharon is extremely naive and innocent while Susan is more alert to the real world.Also I can find there is no real spark between Dennis Quaid and Natasha Richardson like there is between Maureen O'Hara and Brian Keith in '61.Camp Inch was also much more lively and fun than Camp Walden is in '98."
1,Ok a dumb movie that shoudnt have been remaked,"Dont get this movie if u wanna see a classic Parent Trap, get the one from 1969."
2,This takes away the quality of the old Parent Trap,"It was easy for the producers to make this movie: they already had a script. If they wanted to compete with the old Parent Trap, they should have changed the plot. The plot is believable & real, but the acting was poor. Lindsay Lohan has talent, but Elaine Hendrix, Dennis Quaid, & Natasha Richerdson obviously didn't study the script enough.Dennis Quaid (Nicholas Parker) needed to have more heart when dumping Elaine Hendrix (Meredith Blake). Natasha Richardson was too stiff.But Lisa Ann Walter & Simon Kunz added a comical glimpse to the movie. In conclusion, the old Parent Trap had more talent, originality, & acting."
3,"Good try, but not as good as the original.","I have to say that this movie was okay, but I was frankly disappointed. The plot totally went ballistic and was much different than the original. The laughs here were few, and I did not enjoy it. Thanks for trying to bring back an old favorite, but I think that I will just keep the very first ""Parent Trap""! I think that this is a fine example of the old adage: ""If it's not broken, don't fix it."" This was a disaster, though the acting was alright."
3,Why remake a classic?,"This was a cute movie but no where near as good as the original. There is no way they could replace the stars in the original. Don't buy this one, buy the real thing."
4,Parent Trap,"My grandchildren, ages 7 (boy) and 9 (girl) love this movie. They have watched it over and over and it still holds their interest. I know that will pass - but it was fun to watch it with them."
3,Parent Trap,"I bought this for my grand kids and probably won't watch it, altho I'm sure it's a good movie. I know they love the movie. The one I remember is with Haley Mills that my kids watched."
1,legal blu ray?,The blu ray cannot be played through a dvd and states on the screen that a setting in the dvd player is wrong when all others have worked
5,My Favorite Movie In The World!,"I loved this movie about two eleven year olds who try to get their divoriced parents back together. I own this movie, have watched it 2 billion times, and I know the whole movie by heart, that's how great I think it is! Lindsey Lohan rules, and she has a life of acting ahead of her!"
5,Great!,"I've seen the old one and this one, the newer version and I've gotta say that it is a GREAT movie! Family film of the year."
4,Beautiful Natasha Richardson,"I rented this movie recently after the tragic death of Natasha Richardson March 18, 2009. It made me sad to see this beautiful, talented woman in a lovely movie, knowing we'll never see her in another one again. She was so young and vibrant, and she really shines in ""The Parent Trap"". It's really eerie watching a movie or listening to a song, after the actress or singer died young and tragically, and you realize you know how and when they'll die, and under what circumstances. It's not the same if they die old and by natural circumstances.I always liked this movie, and now I appreciate it more than ever."
5,Always a classic,The first version of this movies was one of my favorites when I was little. My kids love the new version. Its not often that you find a remake that rivals the original but this one definately does. Great entertainment!
5,It has class and other movies don't!,"I saw Father of the Bride one and two. They are my favorite movies. When i heard the makers of those movies had created a new film, i was at the movie theatre as fast as i could. it was just as i had suspected. Packed with comedy, heartwarming parts and the greatest actress ever. Lindsay lohan!!!!! Go rent it today!!!!"
4,travis,This flick is great. it has some laughs and some amazing parts. could have been a little bit shorter.
5,"cute, hyper, fun, and GREAT","I could never get sick of this movie! I watched it 4 times in 2 days! It is great! It is spirited and fun for all ages. My question is, is the nanny's name Chessie, or Jessie???? ILOVE THE PARENT TRAP! TWO THUMBS UP (PLUS A COULPE FINGERS!)"
4,Great But: I DON'T LIKE WIDESCREEN,"The Parent Trap (1998) movie with Lindsay Lohan is a great film but I don't really like widescreen format. I would prefer to buy the movie on DVD but only if it is in fullscreen, Looks like I'll be buying it on VHS now!I don't already own it but I want to buy that movie! It's a very good film one of my favorites,"
4,Lindsay's debut!!,"This is a cute movie for kids and girl's sleepovers. Lindsay Lohan is an amazing actress and this is where she got her start. This is a funny story about (very cute) twins who meet after being seperated, switch places and try to get their parents back together. heartwarming, a winner all the way!"
5,The Best Remake Of A Movie,I thouhgt that The Parent Trap was the best Walt Disney Movie I've ever seen. I love Lindsay Lohan who she played Hallie Parker/Annie James. I don't know how you guys had Lindsay Lohan to play Hallie & Annie at the same time. That was good that you guys did the remake of The Parent Trap Movie from 1961 & 1998.
4,Remake of the original,"This is an almost scene for scene amd line for line remake of the original ""Parent Trap"". Linsay Lohan plays the twins. The girls are named Annie and Hallie instead of Sharon and Susan. And the Annie (Sharon) sister lives in England and the Hallie (Susan) sister lives in Napa valley. I like this movie slighly more than the original. The ""Parent Trap"" did not boost Linsay Lohan's career like it did Haley Mills'"
4,Double the Fun,"A pair of divorced parents have birthed identical twin girls.One takes one twin,the other takes..well,the other.Each girl grows up(until the age of 11 anyway)not knowing one parent and definitely not knowing that there is another of themselves out there.Until they meet accidentally at an all-girl camp.Yes!,the plot is truly ridiculous,but ignore that and you have a really fun movie!Annie and Hallie are,let's face it..little brats and a half!,and when they get together,watch out!The twins are determined to get their(lets face it,weirdo)parents back together and also play heaps of mean tricks on their father's too-young girlfriend who is a tiny bit of a cow but eventually you feel sorry for her,because 1 brat is one thing.2 is enough.This is a remake of a really old Hayley Mills film.Just as Hayley did,Lindsay Lohan plays both halves of the twin set."
4,An Adorable Movie,"This is a sweet movie that's as much fun to watch the tenth time as the first. Dennis Quiad and Natasha Richardson are great here and to this day Hallie/Annie is how I still think of Lindsay Lohan, who in her twin roles was cute and talented and radiant with that energy Noel Coward aptly dubbed ""star quality."" If you've only seen the original Parent Trap, don't assume you've seen this one, too, because not only is the '90's version just different enough to have its own style, it's actually the better of the two. Also keep your eyes peeled for cameos from the '60's Parent Trap: not only among returning cast members, but locations, too. As I said in my title, this is an adorable movie!"
5,"Yes, It Is Better Than The Original!","The movie is perfectly casted and acted, and the butler was simply a hoot! Martin rocks as ""the adorable (almost like a) younger brother who waits on us."" His romance with Chessie was every bit as engaging as that of Dennis Quaid and Natasha Richardson.My only criticism of both film versions has nothing to do with the actualy quality of the entire production, but with the basic concept that ANY decent, loving parent would EVER split up twins. That is beyond selfish and cruel, but that is blithely ignored by the offending parties during the course of the action.And, come ON!! Who in their right mind would ever leave - sigh - Dennis Quaid????"
5,Best movie ever made,"The Parent Trap in my mind could be one of the best movies of all time. It has it all: romance, comedy, and much more. The soundtrack that goes with it is fantastic."
5,Outstanding! Uplifting! A wonderful movie,I haven't laughed so much in a long time. If you are in a down mood this movie will definetly lift your spirits. I thought all the actors did a wonderful job. Lindsay did a good job in playing two roles. I liked this version of Parent Trap much better than the earlier version in the 1960's. I saw this movie twice by myself and once with my wife. If you get a chance to see this movie don't pass it up.
5,An interesting movie!,Lindsay Lohan does it this time! She acts superbly ib 2 roles as both Hallie and Annnie! An excellent movie which I caught at the cinema! I was so fascinated by it that I began to surf all the Lindsay Lohan sites I could find! Take my advice:Order NOW!
4,This movie had a great plot and I liked it a lot!,"This movie had a great plot with lots of fresh, new actors and actresses. For some reason, I liked it better than the original with Haley Mills. Over all, this movie is one of my favorites, and I bought it so I can see it again, and again!"
5,"""The Parent Trap"" Movies Will Never Grow Old!","I've seen (and have) the 1961 version, and I just love it! I went to the cinema to watch the ""updated"" version, not expecting much, as I'd already seen the remake of ""That Darn Cat"" (disappointing, although the original was hilarious!). But, this one was BRILLIANT! Lindsay Lohan was great, so was Dennis Quaid, Chessie (?) and Martin, but the best was Natasha Richardson, especially with the drunk scene and all her British comedy-like lines!"
2,Bad Sound quality,I rented this movie for my kids through the instant video store. The movie itself was great and my kids loved it but the sound quality was horrible. It played fine on my laptop but when I tried to watch it through my roku box on our flat screen the sound was a few seconds off from the movie. Their lips would move and then we would hear what they were saying a few seconds later. I have emailed amazon about this and I have searched all over the website to find out how to fix the problem. It has happened on several different rentals but not all of them.
5,One of my favorite movies!!!!!,When I first saw it I loved it. So I watched it again. So we bought it. I cannot say if Hallie or Annie is better. I reccomend it.
5,The Parent Trap,The Parent Trap is my favorite movie and could never be replaced I have two copies of it DVD and VHS so I may watch it anywhere.I give it a *****+* 5 stars plus a bonus star. If you have never seen The Parent Trap then what are you waiting for. Go ahead rent the movie and I am positive you'll buy it. Good Job Cast and Crew!!!!Thanks For Making The Movie.
5,This is one of my favorite movies in the whole wide world!!!,"I just loved this movie. I have watched it at least 30 times. Lindsay Lohan is on of the best actresses. This movie is definitaly a 5 star. The old Haylee Mills is pretty good, but the new disney one is a million times better. All of the charactors are just perfect for their parts. I just LOVE this movie!!!!! I won't say anymore to ruin it, but I HIGHLY recommend it."
5,Excelent movie,This is an excelent movie we have watched it several times with our kids and we enjoy it every time.
1,this was the best movie I had ever seen It was soooo great,Lindsay is a great actress I can't wait till life siz
3,The parent trap,"I'm write because, I need know if the movie (DVD) It'll arrive in language or subtitul in spanish quickly. Please answer me at mail : hermione@esfera.cl"
1,This happening in the 1980's?,"I think the idea of separated twins makes some sense in the original ""Parent Trap."" because its possible there were more ""family secret."" type arrangements at the time those twins would have been born, but when you update it to the mid-1980's, (when Annie and Hallie would have been babies) it makes no sense! By then, far more people realized the importance of siblings, particulaly twins, to one another, not to mention parents and children needing each other."
4,Very fun!,"This movie is fun and funny! I like the part where Hallie and her 2 buddies at Camp start a war with Amy and HER 2 buddies! It's funny where the Hallie group starts messing up Amy's cabin: Strings allll over the place, Sticky floor with glue and tar, a bucket full of sticky syrup which would fall on you if you open the door, and lots of yucky stuff! It's really funny!I rated this 4 stars because you'll kind of get tired after watching it alot.That's my opinion. Other people wouldn't think so, maybe. Butyou should buy this one! It's a fantastic movie!"
5,The most hilarious film we've ever seen!!!,"We think that The Parent Trap is just THE best film we have seen in a long time. Lindsay Lohan is aboslutely brilliant as Hallie and Annie. We have fallen in love with this film! The butler was excellent, and our fave bit was when the twins pushed the lilo out onto the lake! Now we can't wait for it to come out on video!!!"
5,It's Incredible!,"This movie is so cool! The acting is fantastic and the music is beautiful. Lindsay Lohan is an incredible actress, and you should definitely see this! In my opinion, this movie is tons better than the 1960 version!"
5,what a great movie!,"i really liked this movie! all the character's played there rolls exalently! my overall impression of this movie, was i thought i is funny! being that i liked i liked it sooooo much, i asked for it, and watched alot! just imagine, in the movie "" hallie and annie"" were played by the same person! w/out looking at the cast, would u figuire that out! didn't she do a great job! so, watch this 5 star movie, you will love it!"
3,Music compared to the first few DVD releases.,The music??? What a joke! At least the producers were creative enough in the first few seasons to actually pay attention to their choices and not try and fool us with cheesy take offs of the originals. One message to the producers... Go back to what you do best.... originality even if you are too cheap to use the real thing!
4,LOVE IT!!!,I just love Beverly Hills 90210. It' so cheesy and great. I was still a kid when it showed on TV but I still love watching it.
1,Thorny Rose,"I have read comic books that have made more sense. This novel is too graphic for my tastes. The author gets into too much detail about what goes on between the leading characters, Miranda and Dominic. If this part were a movie, it would definitely be rated NC-17. If I had to do it over again, I would not have wasted my valuable time reading this trash."
3,mediocre at best,"Not all roots are created equal. As a serious fan of roots music, I can say that these mediocre tracks seem to be dragged out of the vault so that the record company can cash in . No real standouts here. Those wanting some crucial roots music would be much better served by buying a wicked 4 CD set called REVOLUTIONARY SOUNDS - THE ESSENTIAL COLLECTION OF CLASSIC ROOTS REGGAE 1973-1981, (Shanachie label # 6116)"
1,THAT'S A NEGATIVE STAR,Warning: I ordered a Compaq Presario desktop in Sep 2003 directly from Compaq and the computer would not boot up. When you need to call technical support it takes at least 45 minutes until you can speak with someone. After not getting the computer to work I had to send it back. Got another and it booted halfway and then froze up. Waited an hour to get to tech support and believe me: these people know nothing and are very unhelpful. These Compaq Presario desktops may be cheap....but that's because they are. LEMONS. Worst tech support in the computer industry.
2,"Good fit, So-So Quality","I purchased this muffler through Amazon in July 2010 as a direct-fit replacement for my 4Runner. It bolted on very easily and sounded just like the original factory muffler that had rusted out after fourteen years. The problem started when I went to replace the downflow O2 sensor last week. The studs that hold the sensor to the pipe had completely rusted to the point where I could crumble the threads with my fingers. The studs are now completely useless; the only thing holding the sensor to the pipe is the rusted mass.When I called Walker to inquire about the warranty they directed me to Amazon, saying any replacement would be handled through them. A little strange but we'll see how that goes."
2,Cricket Micro Hair Trimmer,This is the second Cricket Micro Hair Trimmer I have purchased through Amazon. The first one worked fine for several months. The second one lasted about 3 weeks. It is great when it works but the longevity is a problem.
3,"It's okay, there are probably better ones!","Not very powerful & it kind of hurts. I bought this one because of the Cricket branding, i can't believe they would make such a crappy product. Overall works okay."
1,"The most depressing book, ever!","I expected this book to be sad, but uplifting. This book was nothing but sad. I cried for the entire last half of the book and my husband thought that someone had really died! Overall, this is not an uplifting book, it is just depressing! Anyone who has a child will have a tough time getting through it emotionally in-tact. I am terribly sorry that I wasted my money on this book and will probably throw it away because I don't want it in my home or subject it to anyone else's eyes and heart! If you want an emotional but uplifting book, try any one of Nicholas Sparks' books...tearjerkers, but wonderful!"
3,"Didn't make me cry, but","This was a short book and a fast read. Very melodramatic and I'm not sure it's accurate: don't aneurysms take people fast? Do they really go in and out of seizure's over a period of 8-12 hours? And I think sending her husband out to buy cards was just a ploy the author used so we could get into Laura's head for a while. No way would ANY husband who loved his wife run out for a few hours and do that. And sending the brother out to my X-mas gifts? Don't believe that would happen either.And why was 13 year old Anna so rotten to Laura? I mean, yes, my 12 year old acts like she hates me most of the time, but I doubt she would if she knew she'd ever see me again. I also didn't like the woman the widow meets at the end, an annoying chatterbox.Overall, I did like the book. Great if you are in the mood for a holiday tearjerker."
4,--Poignant--,"CHRISTMAS, PRESENT begins with Elliot Banner planning a very special wedding anniversary for his wife, Laura. He surprises her with tickets to see the Cirque du Soleil. It's just two days before their December 23rd anniversary and a few days before Christmas. Laura mentions that she has a headache, and on the way home their car breaks down in a busy tunnel. While they're waiting for a wrecker, the headache that Laura has been having escalates, and she becomes severely ill.The story continues with a shocking diagnosis for Laura and a gathering of their children, Laura's siblings and mother at the hospital.This is a very small book and a fast read. It's well written and although the title is appropriate, this is not your usual Christmas story. I do recommend this book, but some people may prefer not to read it until after Christmas. This is a serious and mind wrenching story!"
2,"Brutal, not touching","I just finished reading this book, and couldn't understand the glowing praise it had garnered. I gave it 2 stars, because it was well written, but the story was brutal. The potential in the set up was there, but wasn't realized. Why was the surprising ""secret"" included? It didn't make me see the heroine as more human - it made me dislike her. Why did she keep sending people, e.g. her husband, her brother, on errands? That seemed cruel. The final chapter which could have been a balm, simply reinforced my impressions: this was a family which was brutal to each other and the death of the mother did nothing to change that.I cannot recommend this book."
1,poor video quality,"The image quality on this DVD is quite poor. It appears not to have been remastered. Greenway unfortunately has a habit of shooting scenes with deep shadows (I think he got Rembrandt to do the cinematography) and this results in very murky images at the best of times. In this case it was little different to watching a video.The film is typical Greenway with the usual highly contrived stylized acting and dialogue. The number puzzle certainly drives the film forward but I'm damned if I can see all the numbers! After a Draftsman's Contract, drowning by numbers has one of the more coherent plots to follow. But who cares, its the images that are the best bit. Turn the sound and have it as ambient electric wall paper at a dinner party!"
2,"A good book, but not what I expected...","With a title like ""Vows"", I expected to find a number of different inspirational vows and ceremonies to choose from in addition to guidance on writing my own. Instead I found a lot of information on African cultures which was nice (the history of the dowry, how to jump a broom, telling your family of your engagement, incorporating african themes into your ceremony, honring the dead at your ceremony, etc.).The info was good, but what I was really looking for was Vows...There were a couple, but the book was generally about traditions, customs, etc."
2,Author has a big chip on the shoulder,The author does not hide her feminist bias. At every opportunity she points out how men are the cause for all that is wrong with the church and the world. There is no balance in the book. She never brings up opposing thoughts or ideas. This book is 200 pages of feminist theology.
4,The Little Unknown Facts,"I read this book in 1986. I thought it was wonderful. It just so happens that I had Dr. Taylor as my instructor. He was great! Now on to the book. King Cotton and Old Glory gave me a wonderful insight as to that not all the south was for the war. In fact, those who owned salves were against it. That seems to be a lost fact. Read the book if you can find it. I have my copy."
2,Not as good asI imagined,"To me, this video was boring. There are only a few choices and there could have been much more variety."
2,"Puff, puff PASS","One of the worst stoner flicks Ive ever seen. If you're looking for some Cheech and Chong, Half Baked, Jay and Silent Bob etc etc THIS AINT IT! The 2 stars is for Snoop, and the cameos. Least it was cheap through Amazon, even being that its a Blu Ray. Still a total waste of cash."
2,GOING FOR THE GREEN,"The film opens up with a talking joint informing you that the only way to watch this film is to be stoned. It is designed to be cheesy and campy with names like ""N. Hale High School"" and ""Ralph Skinnfloot"". It has an immaturity appeal to it. The plot is immaterial and the film would have been better as a ""Groovetube"" type film than trying to follow a plot about an old pot dealer in HIGH school.The humor was re-hashed (pardon my drug pun) jokes and dialouge that would indeed sound better stoned. The movie suggests that you smoke pot continuously. Even seasoned pot smokers know better than that. The cartoon aspect of the film was good as was the talking joint with the bloodshot eyes. If they had incorporated the joint into the film, rather than someone talking as an aside, I think that would have been more entertaining to a stoned audience.Parental Guide: Over abundance of F-bombs and N-words. Sex and Nudity. Sex talk."
1,I didn' really like this movie.,"I thought this movie was a bit silly. But, my daughter liked it so, I guess it was funny for the kids to watch."
3,It's A Bad Movie,"Regardless of how magnificent you think Snoop and Wiz are, they are not good at making movies. I bought this movie with the knowledge that it was probably going to be bad, if not horrible, but I had hope because of their corresponding album. Two completely different games, but I'll definitely give Snoop and Wiz credit for making a movie at all. Mac and Devin Go to High School the album is a 7/10, this movie in terms of movies is probably a 1/10. But for the $10 w/Amazon Prime shipping its worth having for future laughs."
2,A bit boring,My daughter said it wasn't what she thought it would be. It was geared too much toward one type of person.
4,better then i expected,If you listen to the directions of the character of Slow Burn its a hilarious movie the music videos were a bit b
2,As high as it gets,Got this as a dollar rental. I must be getting a little older because this was pretty hard to watch continuously.
1,Terrible,Snoop and Wiz shouldn't act in movies. This movie is terrible and should've never been made. It's not realistic at all.
1,worst movie ive seen in my life,I never review anything...this is the absolute worst movie I've seen in my entire life. It made my soul weep. That's how bad it was.
2,unimpressed,"Due to interviews and such with both Snoop and Wiz I had higher expectations for this movie. Not very funny at all, pure disappointment. Typical late night comedy worth a one time watch at most."
1,NOT WHAT WAS EXPECTED,THE KIDS WERE VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS PRODUCT. IT WAS A LOT OF WORK TO SET UP AND TAKE DOWN AND THE COST WAS TOO HIGH FOR WHAT WE GOT. A SLIP AND SLIDE WOULD HAVE BEEN JUST AS GOOD. THE 3D GLASSES WEREN'T ANYTHING SPECIAL WHEN THEY WORE THEM AND THERE WERE ONLY ONE PAIR AT THAT. WOULD NOT BUY AGAIN.
2,gasket missing,"the pump was fine.....However, gasket was missing. Shame on me for not catching it before I took fans and belts, out. O'Rally had what I needed.I would have marked five stars,,,"
2,Be careful of a strong bias on the part of the author,"Mr. Burns book was informative but I took strong exception to his reccomendations on physical preperation for the trip. Further, his reccomendation on nonuse of Diamox for altitude sickness prevention also disturbed me. Mr. Burns gives the impression that the trek is nothing more that a brisk walk and that a genuine workout program of cardiovascular training and weight training is of little use. If one were to rest on his reccomendations they would stand a very small chance of reaching the summit. Further, the use of Diamox for many who summited proved to be a key factor in their success. If one were to take these sections of his book to heart I do not think their Kilimanjaro experience would be a positive one. Be in the best condition you are able and have Diamox at the ready if you need it."
3,Agree with Keith Kendall - Caution advised,"As others have noted Mr. Burn's book is well written, and informative. But as Keith D. Kendall correctly observes in a review elsewhere on this page, the notion that a trek to the summit of a 19,000 foot peak may be accomplished without achieving a high level of cardiovascular fitness is not only misleading and potentially dangerous, but frankly absurd. Ditto for Mr. Burn's comments on the use of Diamox, which he either doesn't understand (his comments in the book indicate little experience with its correct use), or again, dismisses out of hand as he has never had to use it. You may. The information in the book is valuable, but as with everything else, it is only a single point of view. I liked the book a great deal, but take some pause when obvious misinformation is attributed to an `expert' source."
2,Well its a research text,"So you decide you want your master's degree. So guess what, you have to take stats. Social statistical research is about as fun as removing your own tumor to be sure, and this book is the lemon juice that reminds you that 1. you are not a doctor, and 2. you are using a rusty butter knife.Did I learn anything from this book? Yes, I learned that apparently there were 3 previous editions of this prose that failed to drive the reader to insanity. My favorite part was reading my wife's stats text book for an unrelated master's degree to understand what the heck this book was talking about.I give this book 2 stars because in the event of a world ending disaster, you can use its many useless pages as either fire starter paper, or toilet tissue. I would personally recommend the later, because world ending event or not, this book already stinks."
2,"Better than death, but not by much","This book should come with a reference to decipher exactly what these authors are talking about. In my Master of Public Admin program, the stats professor assigned this as one of three required textbooks. The other two books were used to translate what these guys were talking about. Three books were assigned because not one book was actually useful on its own. Maybe someone will come out with a great stats book for PA, but I doubt it will be anyone from this group of authors."
2,Like wading through quicksand,This book is a bear. It does contain all the requisite information but is a very dense read. The concepts are complex and elusive for the uninitiated so beware if you are a distance learner.
5,good,"perfect, came on time (kinda) and was in good shape so there isnt anything much to complain about so ya.. hated the book though lol"
4,The copyeditor was asleep on the job,"When I first received my copy of ""Virtual Machines"" and opened it up to the preface, the first thing I felt was rage. There is a grammatical error in the very first sentence! I closed the book and shelved it for over six months. This is an expensive, thin book, and I am simply not interested in paying a premium for low volume technical books if the publisher does nothing more than print camera-ready copy and mark up the result 1000%.That rant aside, I find Craig's book to be pretty decent. The technical content of the book is sound, and the depth is appropriate for an audience that is interested in writing basic virtual machines. I also have a copy ofVirtual Machines: Versatile Platforms for Systems and Processes (The Morgan Kaufmann Series in Computer Architecture and Design), and I find that the two books complement each other rather nicely."
5,My favorite Christmas cd,I love this cd! It is my favorite Christmas cd and I listen to it long after Christmas if over.
4,City on a hill Christmastime,"This cd is a very nixed genre of christian music, it's excellent. The BEST song is definitely Out of Eden's"
2,Scent of a Killer,"Shortly after disclosing a theory about a murder to his ex wife, Jenna, Adam Lear is murdered. Jenna knows there is more to it than a simple mugging and turns to her former flame, Frank Renaldi, for help. The police detective is at first surly, as he fights his attraction to Jenna, but when danger heats up, he can't fight it any longer. He must save the woman he loves.** Unfortunately, relational transitions are jumpy and the plot tends to meander, as well as having holes. What could have been a wonderful story falls short. **Reviewed by Amanda Killgore, Freelance Reviewer."
2,Not as good as I'd expected,"I must be the only person who DID NOT find the story ""Scent of a Killer"" engaging, thought-provoking and a great romatic suspense.I was really disappointed in the development of a relationship between Jenna and Frank. It's like, one minute he's a friend and the next, she's in love with him? I thought this needed a little more development, as well as the reasons why Frank was such a butt when he was younger and didn't fight for the woman he loved. It might have made all the difference.The plot involving the Russian mob was a little... well, I guess it wasn't my style. Interestingly enough, I normally love stories involving the mob."
3,New author for me,"During her first exhibit, Jenna's ex-husband shows up and asks her for help. He suspects a high-profile company has ties to a group of international criminals. He thinks that Jenna may have some photos to prove that can prove his suspicions correct. Before she can agree to give him the photos, Adam is found dead. The police think his death was due to a random act of violence, but Jenna suspects differently. Jenna asks for help for Adam's best friend Frank, who is now a private investigator. With Jenna's life in danger, Frank must stay one step ahead of a killer to keep her alive. To complicate things, Jenna and Frank have a history of their own that they must overcome in order for them to be able to work together.This was a quick read. It was just okay for me. I liked the development of the relationship between Jenna and Frank, and the mystery part kept me riveted. This was a new author for me, and I wouldn't mind reading another of her books."
4,"Early Block - bleak noir, desperate characters, and a pretty good mystery","This is the 3rd novel in the Matt Scudder series. It's early Lawrence Block, lacking some of the polish of his later books, but even back then he was great at hardboiled noir, and desperate characters, and driving a story quickly. The mystery aspects of each book have improved -- this is the first one where I didn't figure out the murderer before the end.I haven't read the later Scudder books (except Eight Million Ways to Die), but I understand the style and tone changes considerably. This book was bleak noir, in the same vein as other early Block novels such as Grifter's Game and The Girl With the Long Green Heart."
1,spongebob,Boughtwrong one accidentily for my 6 yr old. Thought it was the dvd. He didn't want to have to sit at the computer to watch it if he wanted to. But I told them what happened and they gave me a refund so I could get the regular one.
4,Renewing the City,I thought this book was very informative about city inner community. It addresses the way the communities should come together.
5,Devotion,Great book. The devotions make you think about the true meaning of Easter. They are short and to the point. Takes you through all of lent. Plus readings on Sunday from the Bible on Jesus journey.
3,clutch,cant say much about this it wouldnt fit my wranglerbut it was very easy to get a refund back from amazon very quick and easy
3,Not What I Was Hoping For,"I was hoping this would be ""Professionally shot"" and show the Black Hole crowd during games IN THE STADIUM. If you remember before the AFC Championship against the Ravens, NBC did a piece on the Black Hole with Marilyn Manson's ""Beautiful People"" opening it up. I was hoping for something like that. This dvd is mostly just interviews with tailgaters outside of the stadium. It's more like a cheap bootleg, no offense."
5,Destroys the stereotypes!!,"A great examination of the most loyal sports fans in the country. Destroys the myth that Raider fans are uneducated criminals. Raider Nation is filled with people from all backgrounds, gender, job description and favorite methods of applying body and face paint! As the recent televised contest between Raider and 49er tailgaters showed, Raider Nation has no equal in cooking and tailgating! A must for members of the Raider Nation."
3,"Different, but good","This play is good, but I was put off by all of the Spanish that the characters speak. I do not speak Spanish so it was really hard to keep turning to the back and trying to look up what was being said. Eventually I just gave up and just had to deal with not really understanding some parts. I get that the Spanish speaking made it feel more authentic, but unfortunately it made me feel lost and disconnect from the play."
3,Maybe there was too much hype?,"My friends bought Xboxes soley for this game. They swear by it. Like them, I'm a big fan of the Black Isle/Bioware RPG's. I've played through Baldur's Gate 2, Planescape: Torment, Fallout and Neverwinter Nights and loved all of them. My friends told me to get this game, so I did (for PC, obviously). I put in maybe 25 hours into KotOR. It was OK. I had some (at times, major) graphical glitches, but that can be overlooked if the game is great. This wasn't great. The gameplay seemed way to repetitive, and I found the worlds that were to be explored rather boring.My opinions are biased, however. I've never been a huge fan of Star Wars. I liked the originals (before Lucas destroyed them). However, I found the newer ones to be disappointing. All of that left a bad taste in my mouth for the series in general."
5,Best Game Ever!!!,"kortor is the best game. The graphics are great and I think that everybody should buy this game. who ever says that they have a good computer and the game wont play is crazy! I got an XP with a whole lot of games on it andit still works fine. I can't believe that they only allow 3 charators in your party. I am amazed that the charators have feeling s in a way and it is so realistic. In short, BUY THIS GAME!!!!!!"
5,The Players choice! YA!,"I suggest this game to all star-wars/RPG lovers out their. Sure your character never talks but WHAT THE HELL EH! I only played the first part of the game to where you go into the first swoop races (if there is more). This game just RULES! The graphics are amazing (cept when it comes to buildings not in play and all the civilians have the same basic voice) BUT WHO CARES it""s a great game and you have to try it out!"
5,Not actually a review,"Well despite this being one of the greatest games I've ever played, I'm actually commenting on the pictures provided above. The pictures seen are from the as of yet unreleased MMORPG Knights of the Old Republic. Not from the original game. Just thought I would let people know."
5,The Best of Bioware,"KOTOR is probably my favourite RPG of all time, and up there with my favourite games ever, period.The reasons for this are many. It's got a great setting, a good script and characters, wonderful music and good pacing. There are bad parts, but really, they pale compared with those of other games, and even the sequel.What's more, it's a game I can play even now, six years after it was released without problem."
4,Great RPG and does the star wars name proud,I bought this version to see how it plays vs the xbox version. Well the advantages of the PC are of course you can turn up the graphics if your computer can handle it. I think the xbox version is better in all honesty but it's still great on PC. The battle system is a quasi real time where you can put all you attacks in a box and can pause at any time. It also has a great story and at the end you'll really be glad you got this gamegraphics-8/10 depending on your system specsstory- 9/10 one of the best I've ever seengameplay- 7/10 I liked the xbox version better but its oksound-8/10 what you would expect for star wars with orchestral sound but nothing that will make you remember itIn closing I would recommend getting it for the xbox if you have one but if you dont you wont regret buying this game with its great story and fighting.
4,The game still rocks,"I got this game for my birthday after my older brother recommended it. Even though it's several years old, it's still a lot of fun to play. Lots of options. Only problem I've found is the character can freeze up in heavily populated areas and then move really fast. Must be a memory issue. Definitely worth the cost though."
1,Program crashed repeatedly,"This program became unstable after just a few hours of play.At one particularly difficult part (which also required sitting through a long cut-scene) the program would crash just before you got to the point where you could save. After 8 tries, I gave up and reinstalled the software. I was able to complete the game only once before the frustration factor became too high."
3,Pretty good game,"I love most things Star Wars, but I had some difficulty getting into this game. I thought the storyline was pretty fun, there were some neat twists, but the gameplay left something to be desired. I guess that last statement should come with the caveat that unless you like turn-based games, where the action stops every time it's your turn to make a move, then the gameplay leaves something to be desired. I also did not enjoy that the landscape is not entirely explorable (there are boundaries that look as though you should simply be able to jump onto and over them, however, there is no ""jump"" action in this game). If you're looking for a game in the Star Wars series with a essentially entirely explorable landscape and mouse-click mashing action, then I would recommend checking outStar Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy."
4,Is it the best RPG ever?,"Okay, it's not the best RPG ever. Actually, it's a little bit dull at times. Nevertheless, as a Star Wars fan, I had TONS of fun playing around in this seemingly endless storyline. However, it does get fatiguing after 40-50 hours of play. It's not like some RPGs where the story gets MORE interesting over time. This one just seems to take you from one part of the story to the next, and after a while the novelty starts to wear off, and you begin playing just to finish the game. If you've never played it - it's a STEAL for how much these are going for on Amazon. If you are a Star Wars fan, I'm sure you'll enjoy it."
1,Don't buy it if you don't like twitch games,"Knights of the Old Republic contains some unavoidable ""mini-games"". Two of these are essentially twitch games -- Swoop racing, and fighting other ships from your turret gun. What's worse, both of these twitch games are mandatory at various points in the game -- you cannot go on without performing adequately. The Swoop race while tedious is not too difficult, but the turret gunning is almost impossible for me -- and represents exactly the kind of gameplay I hate.That's all and good if you expect it, but most folks buying this game will assume that as an RPG it does not require twitch skills. That is not the case, and you could end up being stuck with a game you can't finish."
4,125th dumbest game I've ever played. It was o.k.,"Overall: a half decent game, a hybrid action/role-playing. I preferred Jedi Outcast. I suggest that one first (unless you like cut scenes, talking, etc)Positives:1). You are interested in building the powers of your characters2). Politically inncorrect verbal choices are yours around every corner3). Great graphics4). Battles 'can' be fun (3 jedi throw thermal detonators, then all throw their lightsabres into oncoming traffic, then hack n'slash baby)Negatives1). Switching from blasters to swords and back again gets tiring2). Limited battle strategy for the weary. 3 jedi w/ lightsabers and hack n' slash is the best offense.3). Since your a jedi everyone wants you to rescue someone, side quests are just not that motivating4). You've got to 'baby' your fighters in battle, constantly reminding them what actions to take. No common battle sense.5). Characters have too many emotional problems"
3,"Kotor, rocks on x-box. On pc? Dun cut it","I think this game gets 10/10. On x-box. I don't have an x-box, but my friends and cusions do, so i play it often. SO, i said ""Ill save up 50 bucks to buy it!""I messed up. The pc version takes up alot of space, and if i use codes and mods? I can't leave the first freakin' door. Its fun, and chatings fun, but if i cheat to taris, well.. i don't have carth. BUT i have too much stuff.. Im evil.."
5,du du dun duuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuun duuuuuuuuunnnnnnnnnnnn,"Jedi outcast was the shiznitz, I don't care what anyone says. Any star wars game that allows me to run around and hack ppls arms off with my light saber is an A+++++ game. And now there's something potentialy better on the horizon !!Old republic looks very promising. If the wookies are as bad a$$ as Klye in Jedi outcast it's gonna be ON. 2 wookies and a sith knight, that's all I'll need !!"
3,Potty mouthed characters,"I will say that this game was fun to play, but if you have small children or any children under 16 for that matter, I suggest you wait to play this while they are either sleeping or not in the same room. I say this because there are scenes starting right at the very beginning of the game of half nudity. Dancing Zwi-liks (sorry I know I spelled that wrong) who are wearing what I would hardly clothes. The word Da*m among other bad words are used often throughout the game, and I found I had to cut down the sound and just read the subtitles as I found that highly offensive. It does not seem like they had the most intelligent people writing the scripts for these characters, I mean come really why do those bad words have to be put in there anyway? If there was not all that semi nudity and profanity, I would have given this game 5 stars and not decided to sell this on ebay. This is not a game I would want any of my children to play. If I can also give this a grade, I give it a C-"
1,Waste of money/time,"I was under the impression that this game was a first person shooter which it is not. Maybe I'm biased against RPG games but.. If you like pointing a sword cursor over an enemy and watch your character from a third person view slowly walk up and attack in one predetermined way, than this is your game. If you like overly complicated controls, tiny unsymbolic icons, complicated classes and scoring for every imaginable character attribute, than this is your game. I didn't get very far in this game after I ""watched"" the action instead of playing the action. If you like to track countless meaningless character attributes, this is your game. If you like action get one of the excellent Jedi Knight series games. I only paid $10 for this used and I still feel ripped off."
1,Keep searching - much better games exist!,"In a phrase - it blows!!! Actually if it did that well I would consider giving it more stars.First of all I haven't run into any bugs, yet. I'm pretty sure I won't either - BECAUSE I WON'T PLAY IT AGAIN.Listen, with all the cool technology out there today that enables the player to enjoy full range of motion, excellent graphics and exciting gameplay this one is definitely a step back for the industry. What a joke!Look I know it is an RPG but you can have the best of both worlds and the result would be a much more immersive, fun experience. This is like watching a mundane movie that just happens to have a mouse connected to it which lets you navigate the whole boring experience. Yippeee!!! I'd rather watch golf ( and I hate golf! ).Save your money for a better game. They are out there believe me!"
5,One of the greatest games of all time!,"Not only is Knights of the Old Republic THE best Star Wars game ever made, it's one of the best RPGs of all time. Period. No, scratch that - it's one of the best GAMES of all time. Now, I'm not going to go into detail about all of its amazing features, since the countless other reviewers have already done that. All that needs to be said is that it's a superb, 50+ hour RPG with a story and characters that might be even better than those of the outstanding movies. Buy it today. You won't regret it.Oh, and by the way, after skimming through the reviews of this game, I've seen about ten one-star reviews written by idiotic kids who obviously have never heard of an RPG. Do yourself a favor and don't let the reviews of nine-year-olds who only want ""ACTION! ACTION! ACTIOON!!!!!111!!"" cloud your judgment about this fantastic game."
4,Really good game,"This game is absolutly one that you can get addicted to very easily. You can interact with all the charaters in the game, customize a team, and even build your own lightsaber! This game ROCKS!"
4,"Great game, but runs terrible in Windows 7","I have to say this game is really fantastic. Wish I had known about it much earlier. I won't go to much into the review of the gameplay because that's all been covered, but I will say that trying to get this to work in Windows 7 for me was a nightmare. It would often give me load errors (kick me back into Windows while loading), or have errors when trying to play the movies that were in the game. I did try running it in XP compatibility mode, but that didn't work well either. Thank goodness I have both XP and Windows 7 installed. I installed it on XP and it worked flawlessly. If you have the option of playing this on XP, then do so, otherwise, I hope you have more luck than I did running it in Windows 7."
4,One of the few rpgs where it feels right to be bad,"The combat system is great, the character progression is excellent, and the graphics are superb. The best thing about the game though is the story. The is one of the few games which allows you to play as good or evil and REALLY feel that your actions change events. You can 'fall to the dark side' and change the characters reactions to you, and how you end the game significantly. Highly recommended."
2,Let down like whoa,"Commercials, add campaigns, and hype led me to believe that I was buying the greatest game ever created. Something that would keep me busy for hours, intrigue me with a compelling plot and wow me with ultra-cool gameplay. Nope.This is just an overly decorated point-and click mouse adventure. (Do you want to open/blast/lock the door?) Maybe if you are REALLY into Star Wars, you will like this, but, basically, for a person just looking for some fun, you won't find it here.Lucasarts comes out with some great titles, like the Jedi Knight games and Indiana Jones, but it also comes out with a bunch of crappy ones, this game included."
1,Do not buy.,"I bought this game before Christmas and my word of warning. This is a BETA product. There are so many issues that the game will not even run, it crashes right in the beginning menus. My PC meets or exceeds every requirement. Supposedly, this is a very fun game on the XBOX, but I wouldn't know.Don't send your money to Bioware. They should be sued for this disaster, they rushed an unfinished product before the holidays."
1,WARNING - Check your graphics card before you buy!,"We bought this game from a national retailer without reading the (extremely) fine print on the bottom of the box. On loading, the game informed us that our computer ""Failed the graphics card test."" That's as far as we got. The store won't take back opened software.The game requires a high-end ATI or NVIDIA card with OpenGL 1.4, DirectX 9.0, and Hardware Transform and Lighting compatibility. If you don't know what this means, or aren't sure if you have it, don't buy this game."
3,I Can't Get Into the Game on the X-Box.,"I'll admit it I greatly prefer PC Games to console games. However, being a Star Wars fan and having numerous Star Wars X-box titles convinced me to buy one. I eagerly awaited this game but am a little disappointed. The game is getting great reviews, the graphics are good but I'm finding it boring. I literally struggle to stay awake when I playing. I think this may be due to my extreme dislike of console controls for RPG's. I'm not giving up on the game but I do think I will wait for the PC version to come out and give it another shot. If you don't mind console controls for RPG's, KoTOR should be a winner for you. Otherwise, wait for the PC version."

If you don't know what this means, or arent't sure if you have it, don't buy this game."
1,Too many bugs,This game would be a lot more fun if it did not have so many bugs. It crashes and locks badly. Maybe when a new patch comes out it will be playable.
1,"Do not buy for the pc! Buggy, buggy buggy!","I owned this game originally for the regular xbox, and it has been one of my favorite games. So, I bought this version for the computer, hoping to get into the mood for the upcoming Star Wars: The Old Republic game. Well, due to its age, it has big problems being played on modern operating systems. It will crash often, making it unplayable. If you have an old xbox, just buy the console version and save yourself from all the frustration."
5,No Title,"When LucasArts made KOTOR(Knights Of The Old Republic), they got put on the map. Thats how good this is. KOTOR is a story that takes place 4000 yrs before episode 1, when a 'tyrant' Darth Malak rules the galaxy with an iron fist, much like Vader. Now, a Republic crewman, with a dark past, must find how to stop Malak, and find the mystery of the Star Foge with his posse.The things KOTOR prides itself on is story(think Empire Strikes Back twists), adventure(9 planets), combat(diffrent take, but it's all good), and character chocies(you can be the hero, or villian). Overal, this game will rock your world like the films did, no doubt."
5,Awesome Game,"I run this game on a laptop, and I almost never get crashes. I've beaten it twice. I had to turn some of the features down or off to make it run smooth in certains area, but that wasn't a big deal, it still looked great. I love this game."
5,Fantastic,"This game is enormously fun. the only complaint i has was that this game had some problems with ATI graphics cards. i had a horrible time at first with the graphics, being really choppy and such. Bioware recently released an updtae for the game for ATI 9600 users. This mod has completly fixed all the bugs and the game is running beautifully with maximum res. Gameplay is awesome and the cinematography is outstanding. A definate must buy."
4,"A good game, in my opinion","It's cool how you can get to be a good guy and a bad guy, and all these different kinds of characters. It's funny how the last battle isn't so hard. If you know the 'run around doing heals and killing the captive jedi' trick, it's pretty easy. Most of the game is fun, though."
4,Never played and would like too,I NEVER PLAYED IT YET BUT I HEARD SOOOO MUCH GOOD THINGS ABOUT IT. AND I CANT BUY IT CUZ NOONE I KNOW HAS A CREDIT CARD AND I JUST CANT BUY IT CHEAP ON THIS WEBSITE CAN ANYONE HELP ME OR GIVE ME SOME IDEAS??? EMAIL ME IF YOU CAN silverdavon@yahoo.com i need help plz
5,Knight's of the Old Republic,"Loved the game, have played it before and I had to get a second game becasue my Xbox doesn't work anymore. If you enjoy puzzles and Star Wars this is the game for you. I will say that the fighting system was a tad simplistic."
5,One of my favorite games ever.,"Honestly one of the greatest games I've ever played. Rich world, engaging characters, and a clean finish. Wish the game industry still made gems like this."
5,The best Star Wars game i've ever played.,"long before the Star Wars we know more of now, there was war, and this game takes us into the heart of that war with an excellent story, gameplay, and other nice things to do in the ever expanding universe."
4,Pretty good Action RPG,"KOTOR is set in the distant past of the Star Wars Universe. The plot is semi-linear, letting you choose from a variety of tactics to resolve any challenge put before you. There's plenty of side quests available that aren't required, but they're usually a good idea, and they often provide extra snippets of plot along with them.As your character completes more and more quests, depending on how you choose to solve them, you lean towards the light or the dark side of the Force. This changes both your appearance and your access to various abilities.The graphics are slightly dated, but still pretty darn good, and the plot and RPG elements are excellent."
1,windows 7 incompatibility,"What little I was able to play the game, I thought was really good, but even after trying every fix suggested on the internet, it still crashed or froze up every 5 or 10 minutes. I wish that Amazon would have posted some sort of warning or notice on their add before I bought the game regarding the fact that it would not run on Windows 7 . Oh well, never again will I order a game unless it says it is for windows 7-64 bit machines."
3,Careful Now!,"THIS GAME DOES NOT WORK WITH WINDOWS 7 (or Vista I think)I was too stupid enough to not look in to that and I couldn't play it. $30 down the drain. :(I've heard it's an amazing game, though, so if you have Windows XP I think you should get it."
5,amazing,"Okay i was amazed at how good this game is. I am generally not a Star Wars fan and the recent imprinting of SWG in my mind had put a bad name on all star wars games for me. I was over at my friends house and he had it, and well...fromt he first momements playing it i was caught into it =). The graphics, the gameplay, the EVERYTHING is amazing! It had a very good setup (from the Star Wars roleplaying game, not Dungeons and Dragons, though they are much the same actually...) so the game moved along smoothly. There are SO many things u can do in the game, combat strats, choosing what type of jedi u are and weather u are light or dark. Truly an awsome game"
3,Wait for the first (or second) patch,"Yes, this looks like it'll be a very fun game. HOWEVER...Check out http://www.bioware.com (bioware)s website first and see what sort of problems there are. A good number of disks (possibly just in some shipments) seem to be defective, hanging at 93%. In addition, even with systems that *greatly* exceed the specs, there are horrible performance issues (low framerate, choppy gameplay, choppy sound.) This really disappoints me, as I've been waiting quite some time to play this (and can't stand the XBox - give me one free, and I'll trade it in.)Give them time for a first or second patch before buying this, and as always, check the manufacturer's website (Bioware) to see what problems there are."
5,Kotor,"Classic game that I originally played years ago when it came out on the original Xbox. A great ""rpg"" within the Star Wars universe that you'll like even if your not a big star wars geek!"
5,Sets a higher standard for star wars games,"Next to Halo 2, this is hands down the best game i have ever played. the story line is epic, the weapons and light sabers are cool, the characters and enimies are awsome, the battles,skilles, and feats are great, the graphics are pretty good, and overall this game sets a higher standar for all star wars games. Theres a reason this game won 40 something awards!"
3,Well Okay,I was pretty disapointed with this game because of it's terriible action mode. You don't just get to hit enter or somthing to fire a blaster. There's a whole thing to go through just to shoot once. I wouldn't recomend this game to gamers that are into shooting. It's more of a role playing game.
2,"""Not That Great""","I oncew again wasted my money. This game was to long, and in the end I didn't really want to beat the game. I lost interest, after the first 6 hours.THE BAD1)The story is to complex and it will give you a headache. 2) When your in combat, you can't do anything else but stand there. What I mean is that the creators desided to create a ""Star Wars"" version of ""Final Fantasy."" 3) The way the characters talk, its like there trying to explain their legends. But I got bored, so I desided to play ""Halo.""THE GOOD1) Well the graphics are pretty good. 2) The people that you talk to in this game, don't seem too helpless. I waas thinking that maybe the characters in the game can really help these people. 3) I love the Light Saber, I have always been a big fan of Star Wars, so thank god I get to use a Light Saber.So in the end, I guess I can see why this game is all ready a classic, but it didn't appeal to me."
3,A Bit Disapointed,"I would have enjoyed this game more if I were able to fight. I really liked the Jedi Outcast games, and hoped that this would be the same. The controls were a bit difficult to get used to, and the beginning was stupid in my opinion. Oh well, I see that many people love this game, but I guess I was just not cut out to WATCH my charactor do the fun stuff."
3,just another RPG... yawn,"how many RPG's can this world make?? they're all the same. open this container, take weapons and health kits from this dead body, use this spell.. KOTOR is no different, sadly. the combat IMHO is just really boring. when you see an enemy, the screen freezes and you decide ahead of time your first moves to make. if that doesn't kill the enemy, your character automatically does standard attacks unless you pause the game and set up your next moves. umm, how many times has this been done before? if i wanted that, i could have bought final fantasy 129 or whatever number they're on now. all of the enjoyment is taken out of using things like blaster rifles and light sabers. it's the same idea as using your shovel or something in nethack (look it up). the good thing about games like everquest and world of warcraft is that they took the stale old RPG formula and did something new with it."
5,Great Game,If you love KOTOR2 then you need this game as well.It was the first in the series and is great fun.not as advanced as KOTOR2 but it is still a very good game.
5,Time investment,"This game is awesome and lives up to all the praise it has received from the various game magazines. All I can really add to all of the previous reviews is this. If you are looking for a good way to kill 2 or 3 entire days this is your answer. If you can't set the time aside to play through the entire game in one sitting don't worry, this game is as easy to play 30 minutes at a time as it is to play 3 days at a time. This is the game for any Star Wars Fan. The only thing that I can say that is negative about this game is I got so involved that I couldn't stop."
4,Lots of Fun,I really enjoyed going over these paper dolls of Erte's designs. Gorgeous & lots of fun. He was so talented & this product will help us remember that talent.
5,An evening read with a good twist to it,"While this book is no Companions of the Night or Dragon's Bait, it is worth a read.It is a simple tale of a girl whose parents were murdered and she is determined that the boy she suspects did the deed - pay for it. The story starts there and then skips forward where both are grown up and she finally discovers what happened and who was responsible.There was only one point in the book where I was slightly confused (you'll know it when you get to it), but the story was well written, is constantly moving and very clever.An easy read for an evening."
5,An interesting glimpse into an underdescribed time and place,"Tsai's Lives of the Nuns gives a rare opprotunity to look into the lives of Chinese nuns living approximately 1500 years ago. In addition to the translation of the biographies, there is a brief, but worthwhile introduction which provides a useful context for understanding the biographies which follow. This is not a book for people who want to learn more general information about women in Buddhism (Diana Paul's Women in Buddhism would be more appropriate for an historical angle and the books presenting contemporary perspectives are many and varied), but for those with the very specific interest in historical Chinese Buddhist nuns, this is a worthwhile read."
5,Billy Collins: Arbitrator of the ordinary,"Billy Collins, in musing to himself, and recording what he thinks about ordinary objects and surroundings, draws us into the process of poetry in an extraordinarily reassuring way, as if to say, ""See, it's a marvel, but it's not so difficult to open up a new dimension. Just follow the train of your intelligent mind, and let us in on it!"" This kind of poetry is what ordinary Americans need in a poet laureate--accessible, but opening new windows to the world of thought and feeling."
4,Not As Simple As It Looks,"Billy Collin's poetry is complicatedly simple. That is, you read it and think, ""I can write poems like this myself."" Of course,most of us can't or we would take turns being poet laureate of the United States. His poems are clear and direct, like looking at the surface of a pond. The more you look, the more you see what's underneath. And his selection of subject matter is the nooks and crannies of life we often don't look in or don't think about enough to see how enriching they are."
4,I love Billy Collins!,"Billy Collins never disappoints. He is THE poet for those of us who don't usually ""get"" poetry!"
1,Not so Entertaining,"I was instructed to read this book as part of a summer reading program for my Freshman English Comp class. I was not so impressed with Collins work. After reading several poems, we were instructed to answer questions. Who can answer questions on poetry? If you didn't write it, you don't know what it means!!! Oh, well, all in all, I wasn't real keen on Collins. But I did like his poem Schoolsville which was not included in the book."
4,THIS IS REAL ACID JAZZ,"This CD sets a standard for Acid Jazz Producers. It blends elements of hip/hop, rap and dance without destroying the original works. In fact I think they were able to enhance many of the tracks on this album thereby exposing a new generation of listners to the works of these great trend setting original artists. It really shows you that this ""acid jazz"" thing is really nothing new. It started long before many of the purchasers of this CD were born!"
2,"well, this sucked","No grooves, justpretty much bad rap over annoying beats. Not at all what I was expecting considering it was recommended based on my purchase history."
5,You will actually LOL!,"I didn't think Gaskell could get better as after I read her first book (Pushing 30), she went to the top of my favorite authors list next to Evanovich. But she did! Maybe it's that I can relate to Claire better or that Claire has too many LOL moments that kept me reading until 2am. Either way, Gaskell did not dissapoint... great read that you won't be able to put down. Chic lit at its best. :)"
3,"Good writing, so-so plot","I personally think Whitney Gaskell's writing stands out among others in the chick-lit genre. She's funny, and her word choices feel original and evocative.But I wasn't as drawn in by the the book's love story as I would have wished. There's something too perfect about the hero, Jack, and I was frustrated that the heroine, Claire, kept making excuses to herself about why he couldn't be so perfect when on every page he was just too good to be true.Also, I felt Gaskell made Claire too insecure, which I found annoying at times, because unfortunately the reader keeps getting hit over the head with it.All in all, I'd say it's a not-too-gripping story, but with better than average writing. I'm looking forward to reading ""Pushing 30,"" which I hear is better."
2,Kinda Krappy,"This tool works well and is solid enough. But, there is a problem with the threaded pin that secures the knurled adjustment knob. Instead of tapping the hole for that pin, the manufacturer just mushroomed the edge of the hole! This is very poor shop practice. After a few weeks of use, the retainer pin just falls out. So does the adjustment knob. This is not a real tool. Stanley used to make fairly good tools. The quality doesn't justify the price. You've been warned."
2,CHEAP AND NASTY,"I purchased the Sidchrome 12"" (#25209) (Irega?) locally, because I couldn't wait any longer for this Stanley to be shipped-out to me. When the Stanley finally arrived, and I was able to compare the two wrenches side-by-side, I now believe that the Stanley Works must know a thing or two about quality value these days, i.e. ""how cheap can you go?""Good luck reading their laser-marked SAE and metric jaw scales, for example. Also, the bi-material handle was supplied damaged, when I was expecting a brand new product. Under the circumstances, it's no consolation to me either, that the Stanley jaw-capacity opens to 42mm compared to the Sidchrome's 37mm.But to now put things into perspective. The Sidchrome set me back 3 times the total cost of the Stanley. Yep, I got what I paid for alright."
5,I enjoyed this story!,"Now, I realize that I am dating myself, but I remember when the original Quag Keep was released, and how excited my gaming buddies and I were to read it. We enjoyed the story, with its gaming references and those mysterious bracelets.But I have to confess that I enjoyed this book even more, at times laughing right out loud as the characters from our world tried to cope with life in a fantasy realm. You don't need a gaming background to understand the problems modern people would face, or their dismay at that lack of hot showers and soft beds.This tale gives the characters life and breath, and expands the world around them. It's a wonderful blend of adventure and humor that any fantasy reader would enjoy."
4,Old Friends Revisited,"When I picked up RETURN TO QUAG KEEP I was a bit concerned that Ms. Rabe wouldn't be able to fill the large shoes of Andre Norton. I have read lots of Ms. Rabe's works in the past and enjoyed every one of them, but she was working in the shadow of one of the true giants of the fantasy genre. I was working for TSR when Andre Norton started writing the excellent first version of QUAG KEEP. She more than made the D&D; game come alive in her pages of that work. I loved the story then and I still like it many years later when I reread it before taking up this sequel.I found Ms. Rabe's approach to the new story refreshing and quite in keeping with the style of the first book. Being a great fan of fantasy, this book kept me interested from the first to the last page. I found myself wanting to read more, which is high praise to my mind.I would strongly reccommend this new version to any fans of role-playing in general or Andre Norton's works.James M. Ward"
1,Return to Quag Keep?????,"What can I say that others already have said. I've read other books by Jean Rabe and some were excellent. But, Return to Quag Keep was a tremendous let-down: I feel like she had absolutely no idea of what the first book was about. Even if it was not a sequel to Quag Keep, it was still a terrible novel."
4,Another good light fantasy read.,The characters in the Quag Keep books really make the story. Where is the 3rd book in the trilogy? Maybe Jean Rabe will write it now that the Quag Keep books have been re-issued.
5,Return to Quag Keep,Great book by Andre Norton. I had talked to her on the phone years ago. She was a gracious lady and even sent me two lettrs. I would recommend every book she wrote. I have over 150 of her books!Gene Kroll
4,Excelent piece of documentary work!,"This book is some of the best christian research I have ever read. It tends to be a little dry at times but hey its not fiction afterall. The way Dave MacPherson researched the issue of the Rapture historicaly reads like he left no stone unturned. This book has given me a new way to look at my life and a new defense of my feelings that the ""Rapture"" is not part of God's word. The Incredible Cover-Up needs to be in every curch library and every christian should read it."
4,The Incredible Cover-Up,"This book was recommended to me by my cousin. It is a very interesting and thourgh investigation into the origins of pre-tribulation rapture theology. The research seems to have been carried out well.It is written in support of post-tribulation rapture theology and gives some fairly daming evidence against pre-trib history.However as a post-tribulation convert due to my own study of scripture, I do not think it goes far enough in giving the post-trib piont of view based on scripture.If you are looking for something that gives the post-trib view, backed up by good solid biblical exergesis, then I think there are better resourses available.If you are interested in the history behind pre-trib theology then this is the book that will give you that.Would I recommend it? Yes! If you are looking for historical backround, which by the way might surprise you.Would I buy it again if I lost my copy? Maybe."
5,Inland Passage,"Why does Dulce have so profound an impact on the artistic lives around her? A lesbian has ended her conventional marriage and is free - or is she?In the most traditioal of romantic settings, on board a ship that travels the Inland Pasage, two women discover new possibility...These and many other soul-deep, gentle tales explore the conventional and unconventional relationships in all our lives - relationships among lovers and friends and wives and husbands and children and family ... and the power we all have to sometimes damage, sometimes ennoble those around us.The broad range and depth of these stories, their insight and humanity, reflect the fully matured talentof Jane Rule.--- from book's back cover"
3,Casual,This is a simple beaded bracelet. Nice stretch. Casual and young. Dont like tags on such bracelets. Have to be clipped off and afraid of cutting the bracelet.
5,Tom Gordon Changed My Career,"In 1972 I studied and achieved the authorization to teach all of Dr. Thomas Gordon's Effectiveness Training programs: Parent Effectiveness Training, Teacher Effectiveness Training, Assertiveness Training For Women and LEADER EFFECTIVENESS TRAINING. I was empowered to transfer my career that was counseling into training. As Tom mentioned in his P.E.T. book, counseling and therapy were not to effective in creating change, but education and training in the essential skills for functioning as an authentic person works. From that day until the present (December 2012, I continue to use Tom Gordon's model at the heart of all my seminars. The results have been success after success with all groups. I have had the opportunity to assist others to become more effective in their lives for 40+ years."
2,Zombie,Its just Ok.Nothing exciting. The rubber head is smashed in and won't round out. And does not look liked it is pictured.To much $$ for the qualityDont buy.
1,not a good buy,"I received the tool tank as a gift. I was glad to get it free. i would not have bought this. its cheaply made, doesnt stay together well. dont waste your money."
5,"Read, read, and re-read!",Definitely on my recommended book list. A must read for women in business.Susan BockThe Success Coach for Women in Businesswww.SusanBockSolutions.com
5,It's All in the Process,"By utilizing the strategy outlined in the book, Account Executives (AE's) are much more likely to encounter success when on sales calls. So many times in our business, management wants to know what each AE ""has in the funnel"". The problem is, the AE's don't necessarily know how to proceed with anything in the funnel. Ray's strategy involves everything from pre-call planning to asking for the business, all in a way that's comfortable for the AE and, in a fashion that allows he or she to be in control of the situation. A must read, in my opinion, for anyone looking for sales success."
2,The fit? Not so fabulous.,I think these run a touch small and are not all that comfortable compared with other thongs I own.
4,Confortable!!,"very nice.. very soft.. its smaller than I though though.. I ordered a size L, as I usually am, and it's kind of tight, so I recommend to order a size larger..."
5,excellent as intended,"i don't know why reviewers are parsing and saying, well, this is actually a travelogue or it isn't really about religious concerns...come one, it is simply a travelogue about a spiritual journey that more than transcends ""religiosity"".....thus, it succeeds by its OWN standards.anyways, i am reading this again. it deepened my respect for Islam.i admit that i am a pagan and liable to slip into sufi-modes....but then, i see Islam as grounded in a paganism it should embrace. if only it would, it would be THE premier ""religion""....this book rocks...Islam needs to recognize its roots in AL-LAT....and the femininie...and the djinn.....it already circumnabulates a pagan/celestial rock in the KA'ABA once a year. there is hidden beauty everywhere in the unknown folds of this tradition."
3,One of my favorites.,Thought I had already left a review! Delicious cookies but price is way too high. Will continue to look for them at local stores - sometimes I get lucky!
5,Delicious!,"Hobbnobs are so yummy. Seriously. Man, stop reading this and click add to cart. You will not regret it! I want some right now!"
3,A coating too far,"This jumped-up cookie-wannabe really is taking things a little too far. McVitie'sHobnobsare already a mite sweeter than many British biscuits and many believe that they already pander a little too much to modern American-influenced tastes ever to truly qualify as a proper biscuit. To add a coating of milk-chocolate (which melts as soon as you try to dunk one) to such a confection is really taking things altogether too far, producing a sickly mismatch of tastes and textures that will appeal only to the young of pallet. Or, perhaps, to the glutton.Perhaps the final clue that this was never intended for a British market is to be found in the fact that McVitie have here dispensed with the modest paper wrapper of a ""proper"" packet of biscuits and chosen to sell these items in a plastic tube. Hmmm..."
1,25 crummy craft projects,This Martha Stewart wannabe has neither her idol's imagination nor her flair. Tacky and time-consuming. Skip it.
3,"Okay, but not as funny/interesting as hoped for","I've always the various books of this type written by the folks across the Atlantic (Doctor Who, Babylon 5, X-Files). And I've always enjoyed McIntee's writings. However, this one isn't as entertaining as many. Most of the others are co-authored - maybe that's why. McIntee's ""Deja Vu"" section seems rather limited to whatever he watched on Babylon 5 and Red Dwarf and the book he read most recently, a far cry from the Doctor Who Discontinuity Guide's detailed analyses. The Behind the Scenes section is interesting. Main problem is since the series hasn't ended of course this book isn't complete (only first five of seven seasons), and therefore just begs out for a sequel...and customers having to shell out another $7.95. Just once I'd wish on the more recent series they'd wait until the series has run its course rather than leap on the money-making bandwagon."
3,"Recommended, but not fabulous","I did enjoy this because I love the show, and it's a pretty good TV supplement not that UPN's cut Voyager to once a week. I had to skip over a lot of it, though - the Deja-Vous sections and ESPECIALLY the highly technical sections were both really dull. Devoted trekkies, (think Galaxy Quest) probably really appreciate those parts, but for someone who enjoys the show, not the science, those sections are cryptic and much too long. I loved the ""Bloopers"" section and the ""Voyager Database"", and I really liked the way that the author described every show individually. I agreed with most of the comments and reccomendations - they seemed pretty intelligent, and I liked the plot summaries. I wish the book had covered more episodes, though-it's annoying that it fails to describe the more recent ones. Overall, I would recommend it to any Voyager fan, but it is definately a mixed bag."
3,disapointing,"I did like that this book had behind the scenes info and bloopers and trivia. I wish the OFFICIAL guide had all thatBut the author has gotten many facts about the episodes wrong, as if he never watched them but just read a summary. He also is quite negative about the show as if he doesn't even like it."
4,Brought for my new grandson,"I was so excited to see it was for sale, I remembered this book when I was a kid in the Bronx. I loved reading it to him, it brought back such good memories playing in the snow as a kid."
5,Agree with other reviewer...,"Erika Mitchell's review says it perfectly. And I will add that my 4 1/2 year old daughter has loved this book for about two years now. She's mentioned Ned the snowman on numerous occasions, and wants to do just about everything the characters in the book did, like making snow angels and putting snow in our freezer. Great book!"
5,Gentle story celebrates change,"We loved Waddell's gentle story and Barrett's lovely illustrations. One aspect of the story that we found particularly appealing was the portrayal of the overtaking of the house by nature as interesting and positive--many insects and animals come to live in the house and plants cover the walls and floors. Things get a little green and smelly, but the dolls don't mind because it's so interesting to see the changes. Children of all ages will like this tale of finding a new family to love."
5,wonderful childrens book,"This book was outstanding. It was one of my personal childhood favorites, and for good reason. This book is ideal for parents to read to younger children, and older, more advanced readers will be proud to be able to read it. The language used is descriptive and really sets you in the book, but isn't too hard to read for children of about 6. And if the plot doesn't quite entrance you, the illustrations are remarkable. I highly recommend it for any child!"
2,Disappoinment,Not much here. Very brief and hardly worth the money. Suggest you check it out at a bookstore before you buy.
2,Disappoinment,This book is definitely not worth the price. I was expecting a full range of interesting cartoons. Not much there...check it out in a bookstore before you buy.
2,Made for Each Other,"This may be a good 'let's make-up' gift for a spouse or even a quirky valentine. I did find that the line, ""We remain true to our vows"", with the illustration of a couple sitting on a bench with an obvious rift between them, was contrary to what I would want to give, although with the right sense of humor this book may be hysterical. I also thought that the contradiction of ""Our love is eternal"" followed by ""Till death do us part"" unappealing. I don't consider this a children's book at all, despite it being from children's author William Steig."
5,"luv it , luv it, luv it.",I first saw a promo spot for this Kaiju Big Battle stuff on my favorite DVD of all time-( Kung Faux: Volume 1 )-and I have been hooked on these guys ever since...they have a killer website! I can't wait to get this DVD when it comes out in January...Kaiju & Kung Faux should go on a tour together and release DVDs every month!
5,Kaiju Rules!,"Sure it looks majorly cheesy but it is the funniest DVD I have bought all year. If you enjoy wrestling and all the fakeness that entails, then you will love Kaiju Big Battel. Just watch out for Doctor Cube"
4,Gripping read for a would be foster parent,"I read this book when I was starting out in the fostering world. I hadn't yet gotten a child, but was on the list. It wasn't an easy read for someone who wanted to adopt a loving child and get on with her life! But, the book is so well written that I muddled through and found enough heartwarming stories intermixed with the abuse and neglect tales. Now, after actually fostering children, I know what she speaks of first hand. thank you for this book.[...]"
5,Remarkable writer and story,"I bought this book to help me understand some of the dynamics of foster parenting. It did that and much more. Kathy Harrison has years of experience to draw from, giving the reader some understanding into the lives of the foster parents and the children. She did an exceptional job at telling the stories of hurt little children. At times I felt like I could feel their pain and I cringed at the details. Some instances were horrifying. She is a truly gifted, extraordinary writer; the way she could put into words how they felt and what they sadly went through was heart wrenching. I read this book in 3 days. Her writing is absolutley captivating.It's real life and it's an eye opener to anyone who has lived a sheltered life or for those who are unaware of what goes on with kids in the system. Give this one a try and see how it might possibly change your life."
3,Interesting but too general,"Another reviewer said this was ""fast-paced."" I found it too much so. I never felt I got to know the children Ms. Harrison writes about, although the book does give a good overview of the foster care system. If shorter, it would have made a good essay on the system; if longer, it could have focused on the children and their stories. Without more detail, the book is rather flat and the children remain mere examples of the results of abusive and neglectful parents -- instead of the multi-dimensional people that the Harrisons obviously know and love."
4,Too Short,"I wish this book was much longer--I wanted to know more. The story of a family with the resources to have a luxurious easy life, but chose to open their home and hearts to children who had less than nothing. The selflessness of this family is amazing. I just couldn't have done it. I couldn't have divided myself into so many pieces and have coped with the disorganization. But, I wholeheartedly admire the people who can. Such an inspiring story. Don't miss it!"
5,One Foster Mother's Story,"A well-written good hard look at one foster mother's experiences--the children she got to keep, the children she was forced to let go, and the children who she did not have the resources (mental, emotional, or physical) to care for. Despite the bad (and Harrison spent many years dealing with a seriously abused sexual perpertrator), you can tell in the end that she is not defeated."
4,Great insights,This book provided great insights into the joys and struggles involved in foster care. I would recommend this book to anyone considering foster care and to all social workers involved in accompanying families on this journey.
5,a reader,"I could not put this book down!! I like to read about foster children because I am studdying that in college. Kathy Harrisonis a great author as well as a great foster mother as well. I hope she continues to put out more stories about foster mothering, she does so well at both!! She is very honest in her book, and states that she has a tough time with some, and an even tougher time with others. She is definitely a fighter, and it gives me more respect towards her as aperosn that she shares her tough times as well as some joyous situations while enduring the challenges as a foster mother. I also like the fact that her husband was backing her up 100%. If anyone else knows where I can read more books by her (or in relation to this same subject) email me at tbyrd6969@yahoo.comOtherwise, happy reading!!!"
1,utter dross,"a very poor attempt to fictionalise the world of the soccer hooligan. Badly written, badly plotted and an ending so obvious it might as well have been in the preface.Save your money or better still purchase a copy of either The Crew or Top Dog by Dougie Brimson."
5,So realistic I could almost feel the pain!,"An excellent book, following the explosive violence of the fictional London football firm, the CBA. It is an insight into the way the hooligans operate as an intelligent unit to get a buzz from what they love most, fighting , and being the top boys."
1,Don't waste your money!,"I purchased this for my very active 4 year old. I liked the idea, but it really stinks! We can't get the games to play the way they are supposed to. When you wiggle your arm to ""touch"" one thing on the screen, it ends up picking up everything else on the screen. We have tried everything! Very disappointed."
2,My 3 1/2 yr Old Didn't Like it,"I was excited to purchase this product for my high energy 3 1/2 yr old son. It's a good concept, however, my son cannot seem to stay in the proper position within the screen, and a slight wrong move will make the game have a mind of its' own. I've tried using it only 2x, but he shows no interest in it. Maybe better for an older child?"
2,not a time or effort saver,"I wish I had thought about this purchase a little longer. It takes a large space to work on the sifting, the clumps have to be dumped from a large container into a trash bag, then the litter from one large container to another, after the sifter is reinserted. Clear enough if you look at the picture, yet I didn't really think it through. It is hard to do without spillage, and so can be pretty messy and it seems like a major operation. I'm currently using sifting liners inserted into this contraption and ignoring its sifting capabilities altogether. I find them much easier. And, they keep the box clean. In this, you can't really use a liner and now there are three large pieces that need to be cleaned."
4,Can be awkward but beats shoveling,"My significant other does most of the litter box care and he wanted one of these. So far it works great. It's a little awkward getting the waste, particularly the urine clumps, out into a smaller trash bag, but otherwise we like it a lot. It's much faster, more efficient than scooping with the little shovel. We have just one cat, albeit a huge tomcat, that is part-time outdoors so I think we have a low-maintenance litter box situation as well. Oh, and the door didn't work -- we just took it off."
1,Don't even try it!!!,"the locks are pitiful ! the whole thing falls apart in 4 - 5 days , the middle pan is a really mess to clean."
1,SHIPPED ME THE WRONG ITEM,"I ordered an extra large gold cat box, as pictured, and received a medium sized navy and white cat box that my cat would never fit into.I tried to organize a return with Amazon customer service on line and just kept getting re directed.I would not recommend ordering from this seller."
5,really like it!,"I was worried that this would be yet another failed litter box purchase. However, it makes cleaning the box so easy that the cats are having fewer accidents. I have several boxes for two cats but they prefer just one box so it gets overloaded. Now I can clean it whenever I walk by without too much smell, plus they like to use this one too so everything is great."
2,Not loving this product,"I thought I would like the convenience of this product with the strainer pan, and 2 other pans included. However, I found the whole process just too cumbersome. I do like having a 2nd pan to rotate out and clean while the other is in use, but I am using my old large and solid scooper to remove the soiled litter. I am going to have to get a larger box though because the rescue boy kitty I got back in June is now huge and long. This box is only an average size."
2,Van Ness Sifting Pan,Do not like the sifting pan. The litter gets stuck in the sifting pan and makes a huge mess when trying to change. Would not recommend this..
5,Love it,"If cleaning cat litter can ever be fun-not-but this makes it so much easier. No more scooping just sift and discard. Don't mind doing it as much as I used to!! Sorry no video cats said ""No way"""
5,"Best litter box ever, bought two","It took us one year of searching until we found our favorite litter box. The sifter and the two bottom boxes makes this box the easiest to sift and dispose of dirty litter and place directly in to clean waiting second box. This task takes only five minutes even when cleaning at that time the first sifter and the first bottom dirty box, do it and have the entire box react to go next time."
1,S..t sticks in the mesh!!!,"Agree 100 % with Allie - this sounds better then it is practical. The concept DOES NOR WORK IN REAL LIFE. I did try few different litters - all the same problem - there are peaces always stuck in the mesh of the ""cleaning"" part pan and to get them out is a messy challenge.I have 2 other boxes and prefer use the old system - scooper daily.""I loved the concept of this but it is messy. I got litter all over the floor when I was tipping it into the garbage sack, bits stick in the mesh and some fall out unexpectedly, and then you have to pour the remaining (dirty) litter into the other pan to get it on top of the mesh again - which releases dust, smells disgusting and just isn't a clever thing to do."
4,"Van Ness CP66 Enclosed Sifting Cat Pan/Litter Box, Large","We have used this pan for a while. We found that the door discourages the cats from entry so we removed the door with no problems. The pan is great, but the postage is a killer. I have priced these in the store and was happy to ""pay less"" on-line. After the shipping and handling, I actually paid more than retail prices. Tax was about the same."
1,Worthless!,"I purchased this item thinking how nice it would be to lift, sift and deposit waste into trash can. What a joke! My husband went to lift and sift and immediately stated ""this thing is worthless"". I looked at what he had in his hands and agreed. The ""sifter"" had clumps stuck to it, the debris left in the sifted litter still needed scooped and attempts to get the clumps stuck on the sifter to ""loosen"" only made more mess. We took sifter out and said ""we'll scoop any day"". I purchased another van ness sifting pan, without a lid, needless to say I'm not going to use that one either. What a waste of money. This is one of those times when I wished I'd purchased in a local store. I could return and get my money back. I'm not willing to pay return shipping to send back to Amazon.com. Buy the Omega Paw Self-Cleaning Litter Box as we both like this one very much. Two suggestions with the Omega Paw is to wipe down the inside lid every couple of days and do not over fill with litter."
5,Great- ONLY IF you use GOOD clumping litter,"it works great. BUT if you use cheap clumping litter, it's a pain because it doesn't clump until it gets into the sifting ""grates"" and clogs the holes. If you use a good litter and add enough, then it clumps immediately and you just lift it to clean. nice."
1,Stay away from Hawking.,"Hawking is almost as bad a company as Best Buy. That is really saying something. This was the second of 3 items that Hawking told me I would need, after the fact. I have bought all 3 because I have a tiger by the tail and can't let go. I am still not up and running.THIS ANTENNA IS TOTALLY WORTHLESS AND DOES ABSOLUTELY NO GOOD!!"
3,not for beginners,This is for someone with a little artistic ability. The flowers and trees are shown in a few steps with the end result being very detailed. Not a step by step for someone without any talent or experience.
4,drawing,book is good for drawing from scratch. it's helpful for someone just beginning to study art.

5,"Great, does what it suppose to do without problems (using Win XP 32)","Pros: Work as described, a simple a plug-n-play pci card.Con: I don't know why but Amazon detail leaves out the fact that this includes a 4p-6p cable. Its really is a plus, but if the information was there it would've saved me the trouble of purchasing a cable. At least now I have a spare."
4,Works with Vista? Yes.,"Have Lenovo J3000 series, 115 Model 7387 A11 with Vista. The TRENDnet Box doesn't state it's VISTA compatible, but I plugged into a free PCI slot, VISTA recognized new hardware, loaded proper interface, and had it working in minutes. Didn't use cable it came with, had one from my camera. Bought it since I needed a way to transfer from my DV camcorder to DVD. If you don't have internet access, no problem. My system is stand-alone, no internet access, and VISTA had what it needed to make it work. Gave it 4 vice 5 stars simply because I've only used a few days and can't rate its endurance yet."
4,"Good card, but bracket doesn't fit Dell XPS 400","Great price and two-day shipping with Prime. Plug n play as described, and as others have reported.However, the bracket did not fit the post on the back of my Dell XPS 400 desktop. The half-circle that is cut out is smaller than the post that it is supposed to sit on, so I had to snap off the corner to get the card to seat properly.Once I did that, the card works just as described.A small inconvenience for the price."
1,VIA = No good,"VIA is not the brand you want. I would definitely recommend a 1394 pci with a Texas Instruments (TI) chipset. What's my reason? I have a firewire audio interface for recording music and sound. I spent a good chunk of money for all my equipment, and upon recording I am more than disappointed when I hear hissing, popping, and a generally bad-sounding digital recording. If you don't believe me -- or if you yourself are thinking of getting firewire hardware for recording music, check this M-Audio linkhttp://www.m-audio.com/index.php?do=support.faq&ID;=f5abf4bd59b5420f9adbbb6709080d77and look for a new product"
5,Excellent Card,"I was looking for a cheap yet good quality FireWire card for a work PC, since I work with video, I needed a card that could download DV footage to the PC. This fit the bill perfectly. I was worried at getting a cheap one since it could potentially cause system instability (anything you add to a PC can), but this one had plenty of positive reviews, so I figured I'd take the plunge.I popped it into a free PCI port, started up Windows 7, and it was instantly recognized as a 1394 compliant device, drivers installed right away, and that was it. No need for a disk, just plug and play. The device functions as it should, have had it for a couple months now, and no issues whatsoever.In case you're unfamiliar, the instructions are included and actually pretty decently written, although it is a pretty quick procedure. Windows XP and up should automatically recognize and install drivers for it, so you shouldn't need a disk, just plug-n-play."
1,Support and this product sucks,"I have installed items like this before with no problems. This installed, physically with no problems also. The problem came when I tried to actually use it. it did not work.I took it out, rebooted, and repeated several times.Then I contacted the company, twice, and they never responded to my request for help. I will never buy another one of their products again."
1,Did not work,"Item did not work on my computer. I went with one of the cheapest ones, I would recommend spending a couple more dollars for an item that would work."
2,NOT HOT SWAPPABLE!!,I know it doesn't say it is hot swappable but why would you advertise that it's good for transferring digital video from your camcorder to your computer if everytime you connect and disconnect from your computer you have to shut it down first. If you are going to use this card for external drives that are always hooked up and turned on then this product is for you. But that's all its good for. If you plan on transferring video to your computer having it hot swappable is a must. Also the card came with a firewire cable in the package so now I have an extra firewire cable and I could have saved $10.
4,Excellent review of Espionage during the Revolutionary War,"Formerly out of print, this softbound book provides a comprehensive overview of intelligence operations during the Revolutionary War. Covering the more common stories about the attempted kidnapping of Washington and the Arnold/Andre affair, it also depicts intelligence conducted before various battles, intelligence failures & successes, and France's intelligence collection prior to their involvement in the War. Worth buying."
3,"Very interesting book, but ...","The book itself is quite good. It covers the issues of espionage in the American Revolution like I have never seen before in print. Sometimes the author will elude to a fact that a person did and describe it as ""humorous"" or ""interesting."" Yet the author won't actually tell you the event or exchange he is describing thus allowing the reader to decide if the event was humorous or interesting for themselves. So, in that way, the book is very edited in the bias of the author.This being a reprinted book, it is most assuredly the worst reprint in history. Most every page of the book is offset into the fold so that it makes for the most uncomfortable reading. It appears as if both pages of text almost flow together. Moreover, page 323, and whatever was printed on it, is missing entirely.Again, good book for the diehard fan of the subject, but be prepared to work if you want to read it."
2,no es lo mejor...,"simone hace una seleccion de las supuestas 30 mejores canciones en espanol y portugues, segun....?? La selccion es despareja , y la interpretacion bastante chata. Un pseudoromanticismo de poco vuelo."
5,A great collection,"During the 90's Brazilian diva Simone released three beautiful CDs of mostly standards in Spanish, which are the basis for this collection. It features Simone at her best, extremely sensual and romantic, singing good material with lush arrangments. With a few exceptions (""Ata-me"", ""Eu sei que vou te amar"" and ""Apaixonou""), not all the Portuguese songs go well with the ones in Spanish, mainly to difference in the style of arrangements. Still, this is definitively worth buying by fans of romantic music in Spanish."
5,Very nice,Well I ordered these through Amazon and some of the items came broken. I called Amazon and sent a replacement order very quickly and all the items are intact. I am very happy with the purchase as it goes well with our current set of Sango dinner and salad plates.
1,"Broken Dishes, Broken Dreams!","I ordered this set for a co-worker who had purchased the dishes at some store in Indiana on a trip home. All she wanted to complete her set was the salt and pepper shakers, and I found this for her here on Amazon. We ordered and returned them not one, not two, but THREE TIMES because this seller either can not or will not package the items in such a way that they don't break during shipping. Amazon isn't at fault, of course. Their return policy made everything easy to do, and the refund has already been credited, but if you're cooking.com and you see the same thing come back three times because it got broken in transit, wouldn't you try to package it differently at least once? Incredibly frustrating."
4,Beautiful Design,"I love the Splash design. I have ordered the canister set and the au gratin dish. I'm planning on ordering other pieces, but not the dinnerware - my husband can't stand the utensils scraping on the finish otherwise I would have those, too. So, I'm happy to have the other pieces. They are so unique, and well made. I have had the augratin dish for a while and it has held up nicely, no chips. My teenage kids clean the kitchen and aren't very gentle, so durability and quality are important. Ordering from Amazon is great and customer service can't be beat."
1,had the same issue the second half of this movie is missing,but i'm hoping it was just a bad dvd so i'm trying it a second time if this is an ongoing problem amazon should pull it and refund everyone who has ordered it.......
5,I love this book.,"This book is really good. I started to read it and could not put it down. What she says about traveling with her husband sounds just like me and mine. This is a truly funny book, and easy to read."
1,Self-absorbed twit,This woman is someone I would never be friends with.Her arrogance is all-encompassing and her cruelty[over a DRESS-for God's sake]- is stunning.My copy went in the garbage. I won't subject another person to her ignorance.
2,Meh...,"I really didn't like this book as a classroom text. I used it for a Managerial Economics class while getting my technical MBA, and I really didn't feel like I learned a ton from the book. It is not clearly written, and it's hard to flip through to find the specific content you want. If you want to review before an exam, you'll want to highlight as you first read through, otherwise finding helpful information before an exam is a LOT more difficult.Overall, it's got helpful information in it, but I would have preferred something more clearly written with a stronger emphasis on strategy."
2,Got torn book,"The book that I got, practically fell apart on me. I didn't complain, until I found out what other people paid for the same book of better quality."
2,No cd,The cd that should be included within the book never arrived. The book is not in good condition.
5,Very sturdy and durable,"This bracket is very nicely constructed. It is all metal and has many holes for mounting and attaching to your vehicle. It will protect the license plate very well, keeping it from bending and generally getting messed up. This does raise some concern about if the bottom edge of the plate got caught on something, would it just tear out of the bumper?I think this is a much better purchase than cheap plastic brackets as this is something that will last a long time, and looks very nice."
3,License bracket,Was suppose to be universal was hard for someone not in the car body bussiness to figure out. we never used it and have since bought another car.
5,i wanna LOTTA these sticky notes,"LOTTA JANSDOTTER hit the mark with these!The designs and colors that Jansdotter chose appeal to all: women and men, children and adults.You receive eight sticky note pads secured inside of a chipboard-like folder. The pads come in three sizes: 2""x2"", 2""x3"", and 3""x3"" (which is the standard size for 'Post-it' note pads).Do not worry about the adhesive ability here. These work just as well as their brand name competitors and have artistic flair. I just wish that there were more... each pad contains only 25 sheets. My conclusion is that:i wanna LOTTA these sticky notes!"
5,fabulous,"I am also first generation Greek - American and I know how authentic Greek food is supposed to taste...I have made MANY things in this cookbook and they are all AMAZING!!!! It is very easy to follow...and yes it would be nice to have pictures, especially if you have no idea what the foods are supposed to look like, BUT it is still a very authentic cookbook!!! I recommend it to anyone and everyone!!!"
2,No pictures,"When I purchased this book I was looking for a Greek Cookbook asap. The recipes seem to be traditional food. What the book is lacking are pictures. I really like pictures in cookbooks and this has none. I'd like to be able to double check my creation against a picture, especially when I've never grown up around Greek cooking."
3,Ok book,"I wanted to hear this book because Maddie, the main character, had thesame situation as I did (about our fathers). I didn't really like this book because it was a little boring. The book was about a girl that wanted to buy her mom a gold pin, but she didn't have a lot of money. Her mom would say things like this ""Take off that red shirt your dad gave you,"" and the girl wore it all the time because her dad died and she liked it so much. she wrot an essay to win money for her moms pin. In a way I liked it only at the beginning because it made me want to read it more. I really don't know what the meaning of the book was. It could have been a real story because it felt really realto me. It is a sad story but it can have cheerful times too, and that's whatmade me hear more of that book. I give this book 3 stars because it made me feel like I was actually in the story, and it had a lot of wonderful parts , but it was little boring."
3,Realistic like my life,"I wanted to read this book because Maddie, the main character, had the same situation as I did (about our fathers). I didn't really like this book because it was too long. The book was about a girl that wanted to buy her mom a gold pin, but she didn't have a lot of money. Her mom would say things like this ""Take off that red shirt your dad gave you,"" and the little girl wore it all the time because her dad died and she liked it so much. In a way I liked it only at the beginning because it made me want to read it more. I really don't know what the meaning of the book was because it had enormous words! It could have been a real story because it felt really real to me. It is a sad story but it can have cheerful times too, and that's what made me read more of that book. I give this book 3 stars because it made me feel like I was actually in the story, and it had a lot of wonderful details, but it was little boring."
5,mind and body,"I love this book, because it gives more than a theory on how to get to your peak performance. There are so many practical ways to not only to achieve a higher level outwardly, but also to maintain a healthy mental state while you strain to be your best. Included in the book are many top athletes' helpful strategies to guide you."
3,"Too small, but fun.","This backpack is much smaller than i expected. I can only put in a change of clothes for my 3 year old when he goes to school. There is not much room left for anything else. However, my son loves to pull it while he walks from the house to the car--another option other than put it on his back."

4,intersting,"interesting, but not academic enough, lacks historically accurate supportTom AndersonAnderson Analytics, LLC"
1,Total Nonsense,"The ""etymologies"" of Chinese characters proposed in this book to ""prove"" a connection between the creation story in Genesis and the initial creation of Chinese writing are for the most part totally false. The authors clearly know very little about the origin and etymology of Chinese characters. The content in this book pertaining to the etymologies of Chinese characters is totally worthless."
1,What a bunch of crock!,"This is really forced logic and presumptions. Even if there is any connection with God, please don't surmise it is the same God as the one from the Bible. Christians and missionaries have too often imposed their own belief onto other people's."
5,The Discovery of Genesis,"This book should be read by any Chinese who are saying that Christianity is a foreign religion. The very simple daily used Chinese characters reveal the meaning that matched the stories described in the first book of the Bible. The author analized every stroke in each chosen character and explaied its meaning well in the light of the story in Genesis. After reading this book with the evidences the authors presented in the Chinese character analysis you will undoubtly acknowledge that the Chinese ancestors knew very well the God of Abraham, Issac and Jacob."
3,The Discovery of Genesis,"Very fascinating for me as Chinese is my first language. I even found my father's name, a theologian in Hong Kong, mentioned in the prologue. The explanation of how the chinese language relates to the Genesis story is incredibly fascinating, but may not be biblically based.However, it's incredible for me to learn how chinese is the only pictographic language left of popular languages. I believe some of the characters have to do with the Genesis story, but may not be as much as what the book claims!"
3,Better if you know Chinese,"This book explores the idea that written Chinese characters have their roots within the story of Genesis. Some of the claims are a stretch, but the overwhelming amount of connections and inferences within this book is sure to outweigh any doubt for those that question its entire premise. However, without any intricate knowledge of the Chinese writing system, I must simply believe what the authors say on faith. The work tends towards the repetitive, and without firsthand knowledge or interest in the subject, it may quickly bore. This book is an encouragement for those questioning their faith or are simply curious about Christianity, but this book is truly meant for someone who knows both English and Chinese."
2,"Incorrect list of songs which are listed in ""Listen to Samples""","The list of songs in the ""listen to Samples"" are completely different than the songs on the CD I received. The Songs on the CD I received have no interest to me and I would not want to listen to them. The songs in the ""Listen to Samples"" are great songs and I would enjoy having them in my collection."
4,Excellent sociological commentary and compelling story,"Knapp does an excellent job of weaving in her personal struggles with research and social commentary. She is not willing to simply say, ""I wanted control, so I was anorexic."" She realizes that there are many pieces to this puzzle, a puzzle that must be put together if our young women are to flourish.She excels at digging into the myths of our society and the conditions that create an atmosphere ripe for addictions of appetite.One thing this book lacks is solutions, but at least she was willing to ask the questions."
1,Disappointed,"This book was disappointing to me for two reasons: First, it's a smaller format than many other Royo books. Secondly, this book contains only SIMPLE pencil drawings of some of Royo's artwork. It's just a rough sketchbook. The cover art is the most elaborate of all of the images in the entire volume. And although the pencil images are well done, they lack the amazing realism of his completed color paintings. Illustrators (or anyone who's aspiring to be one) may enjoy it, but others like me probably wouldn't. If you're just discovering Royo, I'd recommend getting Secrets, Malefic and Visions instead. In my opinion, Women isn't worth buying, because it simply doesn't reflect the mature Royo fans love (rather, it highlights Royo as cheesy 70's sci-fi cover artist)."
4,Dream Away,"An interesting book full of ideas, and obviously, conceptions...Although there are some interesting ideas(???) portrayed by Royo, the art world still has to admire Fantasy Artists for their imagination, prehaps one of the hardest subjects to create. Out of most of his books this one is well put together, and interesting with the use of sketches and the forward pace created from ideas gathered from around his life and created from an active mind-to-paper. Well done"
2,A Bit Disappointing I,"If you're a Luis Royo fan, which I am, you might like this book; however, it's just sketches, no finished artwork. While it provides insight into Royo's creative process and how his artwork develops, I thought it was a bit disappointing."
5,Lots of Fun Monkey,The Merry Monkey Travel Gym is great. It has bright colors that babies like. The animals are just the right size for little hands. It zips up easily so it really does travel.
2,Waste of Money,"I don't normally post reviews, but was very disappointed by this product. First, the fabric is horrible - cheap and scratchy. I didn't think it was soft enough to put my baby tummy down, which is part of the purpose of these toys. Second, the product does not seem safe. The bar is very unstable and while I don't see any major complications arising from the bar coming down on the baby, the product is just poorly made. There are better products out there..."
2,Good Idea - Poor Execution,"We bought this for our now 22 month old. He didn't really care for it, but our almost 3 month old son loves it. Unfortunately, when he bats or grabs onto the toys the whole bar tips over! We tried putting it into the crib and latching the velcro onto the bars, but it's just a little too short to latch both sides. So now we're stuck with a toy that baby loves, but requires someone to sit there and hold it in place. It's driving me insane!"
4,Easy to stop bar from falling!,"I had the problem of setting up the gym becoz the bar kept falling and I found out from other review at walmart website - As stated by a recent reviewer, there are flaps on each side underneath the mat. Undo the velcro on the flaps, and there are two plastic ""feet"" inside that can be used to stabilize the bar. The feet can be covered by these flaps-just pull the flaps out to the side. For some reason, this is not stated anywhere on the product packaging/instructions. I even checked the picture again, and it does not show the flaps laid out to the sides.My son has just started playing on it and so far he loves it."
1,No point in using,"Someone gave this to my daughter for Christmas. Its cute but not safe for my baby. The bar falls right on her, they toys wont stay on the links without even being touched, and its small. Baby barely moved and was off of the mat. Total waste of money."
5,We love the Monkey Gym,We love the Merry monkey Gym. Our Little one will play on it for hours reaching for the brightly colored hanging animals.
2,A disappointment,"We received this item as a gift when our son was born and were not very happy with it for three reasons. One, it was very small. Our son, who was a small 6 pounder fit on the mat but there was not room at all to move. Two, the material was very difficult to keep clean. Three, the top portion with the hanging toys kept falling on my sons head. I would not recommend this to anyone. The one positive is that my son did like the little hanging monkey. We kept it and got rid of the rest."
3,Cute but flimsy,"The gym is cute, my daughter loves the toys that come with it - even though the monkey never worked for us.The mirror didn't get interesting 'til she realized she could pull it down and get her mouth on it.... yes, she can pull the whole thing over to get the toys into her mouth.THe single-bar design is much more flimsy than double bar models.We wash it fairly often - so I've gotten good at the set-up... and it's pretty easy to set up. but it just doesn't hold up.I'm also not sold on the extra PUFF to the monkey's head. It makes tummy-time difficult for a little baby who's still learning to hold her head up + forces a lilt to any position as she's older."
4,great,My son loves this toy! It is perfect for tummy time as well as just laying on the floor playing. Great product!
2,Not good construction,The bar that holds the toys on it falls over and will hardly ever stand up straigh. It is convient to carry but you have to hold the bar or place a pillow so it does not fal over
5,Very good,My Baby liked a lot. he enjoyed playing in the gym.. laughs a lot. likes the mirror more.. and it is very colorful.
1,cute but not sturdy,I like that this item is a cute play mat that zips up for easy storage. The part I dislike most is that the activity bar does not stay standing-the mat is so lightweight that only with adequate weight on the mat does the activity bar partially stand. kinda defeats the purpose!
2,Unstable,"Thankfully I got this second hand at a a great discount, but I still feel like it was a waste of money! The rounded bar support for the toys is not stable and falls over which I don't need to explain why that is such a poor design for infants. Save your money and pay extra for a product that is safe for your child."
2,Not a great design,"We bought this playmat for our daughter and we have the same problems with the bar popping out and hitting our baby. She likes to play on it, but gets so scared everytime she kicks the bar and it pops out. Also, I think the toys are positioned too high. My 4 month old can barely reach them. Also, we have to lay her more towards the bottom for her to really even be able to see the toys. I do love how it zippers closed and is easy to transport. However, overall, I would not recommend this particular mat."
2,Save your money and buy something else,"I received this as a baby shower present. I liked the look of the mat. The worm's head has some padding so baby's head isn't on the hard floor, the colors are very nice, and the toys keep her entertained. The reason for the low rating is because this toy must be used under adult supervision. The bar that holds the toys over baby constantly pops out or falls over. If they can swat at or kick the toys (the whole reason for the gym) the bar and hard plastic toys will fall on the baby's head or pop out of the holder completely and scare them. When I put her in the mat I try to get other things done around the house, but I can't do that with this toy as I fear she will get hurt. I wish I had received another sturdier gym like the baby einstein one. Even though they are more expensive, you don't have to worry about baby getting hurt and you don't have to lay on the floor the whole time."
1,Beware of the tube,"I thought this was really cute when I received it at my baby shower. However, when I put it together and tried using it the tube kept flying up in the air like the snakes out of the can trick. I took it back and was glad that someone also got me the Baby Einstein one, which I love."
3,"Satisfied, but confused...","I love this gym for my 2month old. The only downside is that the mat can only be spot cleaned, it doesn't detach from the base to use the washing machine. I don't know how well it will work for when he gets older, but it works great for now. Well worth it for the price. If you are looking for something cheap for just a little bit, this is your best bet! Happy shopping!"
2,Poor Design,"This toy doesn't stay together well. After a couple of uses the base gets flimsy after folding it up and the bar flops either back or forward, causing the toys to be out of reach and out of vision. This toy ois designed for a child who is ready to track and grab, but the toys are out of reach. I had to buy longer toys to get my child interested in it enough to try to reach for the others, but he would freak out when the bar flopped out of useable reach. I replaced it with the fisher price aquarium wonders model. This one is WAY better for the extra $10. It has 2 bars, one for kicking, or just reverse the baby when he gets bored. Plus it has a great tummy time set up and way more durable."
4,A Life-Saver Product,"This product provides an Activity for the infant that allows you to watch television, talk on the phone, or whatever. My grandaughter enjoys this mat very much."
4,Does the Job,Our four month old loves the Merry Monkey. He enjoys staring at himself in the mirror and doing pull ups on the monkey. We love how easy it is fold and travel. It is nice to be able to switch out the toys every once in awhile.The bar has velcro loop attachments on the base making it much sturdier than it appears in the video review. We can pull quite hard and not remove it. We feel quite secure in having our baby spend time on the mat.A lot of bang for the buck for a toy that a baby will only use for a few months.
4,Easy to transport,"My son enjoyed this gym from when he was 2 and a half months old and was able to follow the dangling toys. We bought additional rings to extend the length (and now he can pull everything to his mouth), and also attached other toys to the tube. I would have given it 5 stars for the fact that it is very easy to fold and carry to friends houses, it is small enough that can be placed on the bed and the tube fits standard rings (opening up a lot of possibilities), however the synthetic material is just horrible. I always put my son on a swaddling blanket instead of directly on the mat.We never had problems with the tube flying (as the other reviewers mentioned) because our tube actually has little strings that can be attached to the mat to prevent any movement (maybe we have a newer model?)But overall we hare happy with it as a second gym that is easy to take everywhere."
2,Sleeping Mat,"My son didn't really like the toys. He wasn't interested and couldn't reach them. However, he really like the lil pillow at the top. So he naps on it now. (2 months old)"
3,Good for the price.,I bought this in the days of the amazon codes so I got it for about $10. I love that I can just zip it up and take it with me. The only problem we have with it is the bar to hold the toys is constantly falling down. It falls both ways. Other than that my daughter loves her monkey. The money toy detaches and I can put it on some other things for my baby.
1,Cute but don't waste your money,"I got this for our LO because the baby gym was one of the items from our registry/shower that we didn't receive. I figured he would not really need anything special until he can grab at them, etc at first so this would be fine. I was wrong, the hippo is cute and my LO does like to stare at the hanging animals but it a piece of junk, the bar falls over forward and if I was not sitting there watching him it would hit my LO in the head! It is nice that it all zippers into itself but overall I would say to take the $20 and put it towards one of the $50 play mats like the tiny love mat or the FP rain forest one that seem to be safer and have great reviews."
4,A Wiggle Worm for My Wiggle Worm,"My baby loves his wiggle worm gym, and I love watching him play on in. It is convenient to zip it up and take it anywhere with us. The only thing I would change is that I would make the bar a little sturdier, it has a tendency to tip over. Other than that, I love this product!"
2,"cute, but falls easily","My baby loves this play mat. But the bar is not sturdy and has to be put back up every few minutes. It just kinda starts to lean and slowly goes down. I don't think it's unsafe. Unless you are hanging sharp or heavy objects from the bar, which is not what it comes with. The toys are cute and my baby loves it, I just wish the bar for the toys would stay up! I do like the portability factor, that really is one of the best features. I zip a few extra toys in with it and carry it where i need to go with baby."
2,Not sturdy would not recommend,I bought this product for my 2mos old granddaughter. I received the package right away no damage etc. Problem I had is that the bar with the toys is too heavy & doesn't have a stable base so it leans forward or backwards & I'm afraid if I'm not there holding it up that it will fall on my granddaughters face.Will be returning & searching for a more sturdy product.
2,unsafe bar,I LOVE THE IDE ABOUT THE TOY HOWEVER THE BAR IS NOT SAFE. THERE IS NO WAY TO KEEP IT IN PLACE AND FALLS OVER OR POPS OUT. THERE IS TWO STRAPS ON THE ENDS OF THE BARS BUT NO IDEA WHAT THEY ARE FOR OTHER THAT TO BE THERE. I LOVE THE FOLD UP DESIGN EASY TO STORE WOULD HOWEVER BE A MORE EFFCIENT PRODUCT IF THE BAR WOULS STAY IN PLACE
3,Mixed Feelings,"My son loves the bright colors and the toys. The toys tend to come loose very easy and the arch will lean over at times. However, I do enjoy that it folds and stores easily."
1,Not the Safest Toy,"This toy can only be used with ABSOLUTE supervison. The activity bar continuously pops out. It will catapult many feet from the playmat if kicked just right. It has so far scared my 4 month-old, hit the dog, and knocked over many things. HOWEVER, my 4 month-old loves to bat the toys. I only recommend this item for babies who do not kick much."
3,Fun but not safe,"I got this as a present and loved the idea of a compact baby gym. I could easily fold it up and take it everywhere.My daughter loves all the toys in this gym and hasn't gotten tired of them.The only thing is that now, at 5 months old, she kicks the bar and it pops out very easily. I read a review saying that if its properly assembled it won't pop out, but we have it very well adjusted and it keeps coming out!I only recommend this toy if you want an on-the-go gym and you intend to be around a 100% of the time that your kid plays with it."
4,Very nice!,"I bought this as a gift for my nephew, 7 months, and he loved it!.. nice materials, very comfy and colorful. the bar is very light but firm when he plays with the hanging toys."
2,merry monkey gym,I am not fond of this item. The arch falls over repeatedly and I am constantly try to put it back up. When this happens my son ends up kicking the toys instead of being able to look at them and grab them. Not satisfied at all!
3,Good for a basic playmat,"Received this as a gift. Its best feature is that it folds up into a compact size and can be easily stowed (hence the word travel in the name). The downside of this is that the bar isn't very sturdy, and frequently falls to the floor in front of or behind the baby. The toys are good though, the ears make crinkly noises when squeezed, so it provides a good amount of fun & stimulation -- just know you'll have to put the bar back up every few minutes."
1,"HORRIBLE, had to return it!",I bought this thinking it would be a good option as a small playmat for my baby. But the arch DOES NOT STAY UPRIGHT. It would fall over right on my baby's face. It was completely unusable and I returned it after 2 days. Don't waste your money.
4,Decent account of Women in the workplace.,"Sinclair's first critically successful work has similar soundings to Main Street and Ann Vickers. The novel describes the adventures of Una Golden as she learns to survive the daily grind of working for a living in dead end jobs.Lewis vividly describes the dullness and hopelessness surrounding typical ""women's work"" in the early 1900's. Lewis also shows that marrying can also be a dead end in itself, especially when one marries to simply escape working.I liked this book quite a bit. However, it lacked the bite and suspense of Ann Vickers or even Main Street. This book should be read by Lewis fans or those with an interest in the early 20th century workplace."
5,The book was fantastic!,"I read it in high school. I just happened to find it on the shelf and decided to try it. One thing that caught my attention was that the author had gone to school to be an archeologist or something like that. This was her first book and it was better than some I have read by authors who have written many books. She really made us care about Claire, and we got caught up in what was happening to her. She seemed very real. I hope I can find a copy. I've searched everywhere."
3,"Cages of Glass, Flowers of Time","This fiction book by Charolette Culin is really good. Claire hates her mother because she won't let her go see her father. Claire loved her father, both of them had the same interests, to paint. I liked Claire because she was very determined.I liked the paragraph on page #179. I liked it because it shows that Claire is very determined and it really shows that she really like to paint, and she really wanted to show that. Cages of Glass, Flowers of Time is a really great book and I am sure anyone would love it.After reading this book my question is that, does Claire persue her dream in drawing? I really liked this book because it is very interesting."
3,Fast paced.,"Fast paced, but not very motivational. Phil races through the routines but it lacks the punch of a Pavel dvd."
3,Sensation seeking tendency in mountain climbers,hi..could you mind giving me the author email address. i like to talk to him about the book. author name is Athiqul H. Laskar. i wanna his email address. please send me his email address at Rahan786@yahoo.com.Thank you Have nice day Bye
3,Not essential,"This Single-CD includes three pieces from a John- Peel-Session late 1995. These tracks match with those on Autechre's ""Tri Repetae""-album, which was released nearly the same time this session was done. ""Milk DX"" and ""Inhake 2"", the first two tracks, are alright, but ""Drane"" lingers too long without interesting sounds. If you are a completist, you can buy it, otherwise this Single-CD is not essential."
4,A great 25 minutes of music,Although this cd does not show all the sides of Autechre it does profile what I think are the more accesible songs. I absolutely love the first and last tracks. It's not their best but it is very very good.
5,Two decent songs plus one really really good one.,"The first two tracks are nothing to write home about, but the third, entitled ""Drane"", is by itself worth the price of the disc. A high-frequency beat clicks away against the background of a stuttering, morphing, undulating minor chord. Good stuff."
3,okay,"These socks are not very elasticy, they become scratchy after a few washes and they pill up really easily. Also I wear a size 12 1/2 and I don't have a very wide foot yet these are very tight on me."
3,WOW,"These are as advertised. I only gave them the 3 stars because, man, these are potent. I guess I thought it would be a little more faint like a pleasant scent in the drawers. Somewhat overpowering. Maybe over time it fades to pleasant."
2,Too strong,The scent was overwhelming! They are a great idea and came as I expected but the scent was just too strong for me.
3,I liked Gomer Pyle.....,"I ordered the full series..5 seasons. The first 3 were hilarious! But the 4th season it started to not be as funny cause they kind of ""citified"" Gomer. What made the show so funny was that this country boy was trying to live in the city environment...and staying with his country mentality and upbringing. ""you can take the boy out of the country, but you can't take the country out of the boy"" kind of thing. But the 4th season..they started taking the country out of Gomer and it just wasn't that funny. Just another city boy in the city. They also have Sgt Carter's constant yelling at Gomer get more to the violent side and so constant..I was muting it most of the time. It just got out of hand. The 5th season...they kind of flipped the mentality of Gomer and Sgt. Carter and made Gomer the ""smart"" one and Sgt Carter the ""dumb"" one (for lack of better wording). I didn't like the 5th season."
2,Dragoon NaturallySpeaking Version 8 (Mobile),"The software that utilizes the headset/microphone directly into the computer works relatively well (in a totally silent room). However, this ""mobile"" version (where you dictate into a digital recorder then upload into your computer) did not work at all. I called SoftScan tech support and not only could they not help me, I was told if I called again, I would be charged for another tech session. I have since learned that Version 8 (Mobile) was marketed exclusively to AMAZON customers (and not the general public) and that the company has decided to drop this version because of problems with the digital recorder's software that cannot be fixed."
1,Poor Quality Recorder,"Avoid this package, stick with Dragon Dictate Perferred and buy a high qualiy Sony Digital Voice Recorder (DVR). The DVR crashed my system using Windows XP with SP2 (service pack 2 installed). The driver are not Microsoft certified and scansoft only gives this DVR a 2 out five on it's own web site. AVOID THIS PACKAGE"
3,Not there yet...,"As a newbie to voice recognition software, I was initially very impressed by Dragon NaturallySpeaking preferred mobile 8.0. I have now had the program for several weeks and can say unequivocally that I would not recommend it to someone who wishes to use voice recognition to create perfect documents. The amount of time and effort required to train the program -- to make the requisite corrections -- is quite significant. I would however recommend the program to anybody who would like to use voice recognition to create rough notes that do not require correction. In addition, I have found the included mobile recorder, almost useless. Finally, I would join the cacophony of disappointment over the pretty much nonexistent technical support."
2,Tiny pkg of patches,"It is as described but damn, what a tiny pack, I would say good for 3 or 4 cleanings only."
3,Gun Cleaning Patches,"I prefer patches that are a little wider, but these do work for my 45 and the 9 mm, so I'm happy with them. They were deliverd in a timely fashion and at a reasonable price."
4,Get what you pay for--in this case worth it!,"I also tried cheaper boots and not only did they wear out, but I couldn't keep them on my mini-schnauzer. I do have to put the Mutluks on tightly, but once I do, he tolerates them and they stay on. New England winter this year has been harsh, and I'm now not worried about snow, ice, sand, and chemicals getting stuck in his paws. The boots also wash/dry (low dry) well in my machines, just follow package instructions. I would put them in a zippered pillow cover, and wash with other stuff that's not delicate (obviously?!) If they last two seasons, I'll be very happy. Definitely worth the extra cost."
2,Need an extra one,"Our dog loved her muttluks, but while she was running in the snow, one of them came off. We couldn't find it so we are stuck with three muttluks, and we are not buying another set just to have spares. Perhaps the set could come with a spare one for these very occasions."
3,it was okay,"elizabeth is sick and tired of people who say she is too boring and Miss Right. so she tries to do something daring, like her sister Jessica. she decides to try surfing. she meets a cool instructor who falls in love with her, but elizabeth already has a boyfriend. so she rejects him, but he still gives her flowers and gifts. A girl named Laurie loves the guy, and Liz thinks that she is his girlfriend. elizabeth helps her get the instructor. and also proves that she can be daring and adventurous."
2,Surfgirl,"All of the early Sweet Valley High books were boring really,but if you don't agree with me,then I guess you will like this book.Elizabeth is so sick of being predictable that she surprises everyone by becoming a surfer."
1,It turned out to be an LP - 45,"The album is advertised as an ""audio CD"", however Amazon has sent me 2 LP's even after I sent the first one back saying it's advertised as a CD. Has anyone else had the same problem?"
1,Fundamentals of Preventive Maintenance,"The amazon website states that this item comes with a cd-rom. After a few attempts to find out wether or not it does come with a cd-rom,I came up empty No one seems to have an answer."
5,Only for the serious Administrator,"While this book, at first glance may seem like a box of nuts and bolts, the author does a wonderful job of showing you what the heck Windows Script Host can do using almost all of the facilities of Windows.It tends to look like a coder's paradise but it turns out much of this stuff is really very useful in preparing a medium size enterprise for tools to achieve very very low server and application administration.I am starting to re-read for the 3rd time - I am only now starting to get the depth this work is capable of taking me to..."
3,"Dog loved, but I did not","My dog loved this treat and I believe she would rate a 4 or 5, but it makes a mess on the carpet as it crumbles into pieces. For that reason I would stick to other treats that do not make the mess, or only give these to her outside when weather allows."
5,The Cruising Guide to the Leeward Islands,"This book is an excellent guide to cruising the Leeward Islands. It has detailed information about the islands, activites to do, sailing tips, and where to get equipment and supplies. It is incredibly thorough and well put together."
3,"Damaged cover, signed book.",I recieved the book within 4 days. The only writting in it was to another person and singed by Dr. Philip Moore. The cover is damaged badly. Not sure if I will buy form this seller again. For the price I paid I sould have went ahead and ordered a new copy.
5,excellent pot,"A huge fan of all the Calphalon we have, over 12 pieces. Their new ""One"" line is their best. Basically non-stick but can use metal spoons, etc. Cooks very evenly and faster than a normal pot. Worth the money."
5,The best Jeff Beck album to date,"This CD came out 20 years ago and is still as fresh and vibrant today as then. Jeff's gutiar playing is extraordinary. He is doing a jazz-rock fusion album which was very popular when this came out it the late 70s. If your a Jeff Beck fan, this is his best work."
3,good stuff for older macs,"These games will probably not run on mac OS X, so buy them only if you are running OS 9if you have an earlier OS, don't bother, your system will not be able to handle it.if you meet these requirements, and you don't have any of these games, they are fun. Try it."
5,Stevie on Blue-Ray at Sears,"This Concert is really good. Stevie looks and sounds incredible. Sears had the blue-ray of this disk before christmas and I'm sure you can get it there. The only thing that is missing from any of the video versions is 'Beauty and the Beast"", which when I saw her do it in Vegas was, as always steller. It just seems like they could have put it on one of the 3 diffrent virsions.However you will not be dissapointed with the rest of the show because Stevie is, as always, ""like a cat in the dark"" and yes I'd be her lover. 5 starsMike V."
4,Stevie Nicks Live in Chicago,Great concert one of my favorite Stevie Nicks.Waddy Watchel and her three back up vocalists have been with her a long time. My favorite is a 1982 concert but it is not on dvd. When it is I will definately buy it!
5,Never a disapointment,"Once I saw Stevie perform on Oprah, I knew I had to order this CD. Love the pre-release opportunities at amazon.com."
5,A Must Buy!,"I have been a fan of Stevie and Fleetwood Mac ever since my Mom bought a copy of 'Rumours' when I was 7 years old. I became an ""avid"" fan after seeing her on the 'Rock a little Tour' in 1986.Unfortunately, I just missed out on getting tickets to the taping of the live performance of this DVD. After seeing it, I am even more sorry that I didn't have the opportunity to see such an incredible show. Stevie LOOKS and SOUNDS fantastic!! If you are a Stevie Nicks fan at all, this DVD is a must have. Also, if you haven't picked up her last solo album, 2001's 'Trouble in Shangri-La' do yourself a favor and purchase both now!!!Trouble in Shangri-La"
3,DVD CONFUSION????,Last year I bought a DVD which states Sound Stage Stevie Nicks Live on the cover. Now there is another DVD being released that states it's a live version of her show in Chicago. They both have the exact same covers on the box only one says Sound Stage and the other one has Live in Chicago. Same exact set list. I think they are the same exact DVD's just being re-released as new. Can anyone explain? This is weird. I'm not going to buy the same exact DVD with a different name on it! Why would they say this is a different DVD? Has anyone bought the two DVD's? Are they different? Thanks for your help!Live In Chicago DVD
5,STEVIE NICKS ROCKS!!!!,"Stevie Nicks is the ONE...THE ROCK AND ROLL GODDESS!!! NO ONE COMPARES TO HER....her voice, her moves, her attire, her boots, her hat, her smile, dam....just cant stop writing all these traits this little 5 feet woman possesses.....i have seen her live for like 1000 times, solo and with fleetwood mac, (TEXAS AND IN VEGAS)....YOU NEED TO BUY THIS CONCERT...SHE REALLY ROCK AND ROLLS....gold dust woman, rhiannon beginning is phenonmenal, if anyone falls in love and sarah bring back old memories when one was younger and in love....her kick...yes she still kicks, and high mind you.....wow....her hat with a huge feather,....MADONNA, SORRY MAN, YOU ARE JUST A CHAMELEON,....STEVIE IS AUTHENTIC........YOU NEED TO BUY THIS CDP.S I AM GOING TO GO TO SEARS TO SEE IF THEY HAVE IT HERE IN LAREDO TEXASalberto"
2,Condition deplorable!,"I ordered this twice in the last year from Amazon and after six months the disc no longer plays on my surround sound system, my stereo or my car stereo. They seem to only last six months. I've ordered a third copy from another vendor that claims to ships from the factory. As this is one of my favorites, I am quite irritated at having to order the disc over and over. I'll update you as to the quality of new disc when it comes in. I positively hate putting a negative review on anything associated with my favorite artist and want to reiterate that this complaint is as to condition only - not content."
2,Disappointment from Fleetwood Mac days!,"This soundstage performamce was a disappointment for me; there was too much talking in between songs. I just wanted her to sing more and wished she would have had Lindsey Buckingham as guest star to sing their famous ""Silver Springs"" and ""Landslide w/Lindsey"". I really like Stevie Nicks, but this one didn't do anything for me. Sorry!"
3,But it isn't released yet!,"One of the previous 'reviewers' said that he had purchased this concert DVD in Sears. But this DVD hasn't yet been released (not until March 2009, according to Amazon.) What gives???"
3,Birdless,"I'm not sure if the birds are scared of it or if I simply live around no birds, but I've had it up for a week and I haven't got any visitors."
2,Cheap item,"I was rather surprised when I got this item in the mail. The feeder itself is just a cheap piece of plastic with two suction cups. The one I got is separating at the top. I think this looks like it should sell for about five dollars or less, it really is extremely cheap looking. I wish I had just bought something locally instead of buying this online without seeing better what it looks like."
4,The new avian dining hotspot in the neighborhood,"I bought this feeder a few weeks ago and was feeling a bit disappointed. Although it was easy to fill and hang(soaking the suction cups in some warm water helps), no birds had shown up yet.This morning, however, I woke up to find a male finch sitting on the seed inside the feeder munching away, while his mate sat on the roof of the feeder singing. Also, a small group of pigeons had assembled to eat the corn the male sparrow tossed out of the feeder. The finch couple returned periodically throughout the day, at one point with the male feeding the female while they both perched on the feeder rim.All in all, this is a nice, simple little feeder. It can definitely support the weight of two small birds and the seed is easily accessible. It is a wonderful way to observe bird behavior a close range, you just have to be a bit patient."
2,Trouble with the suction cup,I like the look of it not real big but one of the suction cups won't hold. I had to use tape to keep it from falling.
4,pretty good,i like this feeder so far no birds have came. i put it up in my bedroom window and it seems as it stuck pretty well so far!!!!!!!!!!!! it is pretty cheap so i dont know how well it is going to last. i was dissaponted that it wasnt a clear blue it was clear so picture was wrong but so far it's a great feeder!
5,Front Row Seat for Birds!,"I purchased this for my 4 year old daughter to have a front row seat to see the birds and was a bit hesitant at first since we didn't get any birds, but after a month we have finches and it's so fun to see them up close. I followed the recommendations of others on how to get the suction cups to stick and we haven't had any problems with it falling down. It's an inexpensive fun birdfeeder. I enjoy it just as much as her!"
2,"Cute, not well made.","I wasn't impressed with the construction. The birdhouse was in two pieces with one suction cup falling off when it came out of the box (you can see the seam in the photo illustration to the left of the bird where the unit clips together). This seemed more like a $2.99 drugstore item than a ten dollar item. I will update the review when I see how, or if, it holds up in use."
1,bird feederperkypet 348 window wild bird feeder,"i bought a perky pet window wild bird feeder from amazon and it fell apart.but all i did was call and amazon made it good,no questions asked.they replaced it within just a few days.i have been very satisfied with amazon and will continue to buy from them."
1,Worst product ever offered on Amazon,This bird feeder is a total piece of crap. It's made of cheap thin plastic with teensy connectors to bring both halves together. Two of the flimsy connection prongs immediately broke upon insertion. I doubt the product cost 25 cents to make. Avoid this poorly made feeder.
1,LOL... What a disapointment!,I ordered three of these for my cats. I got them and guess what?? Not one of them stayed together. I had to silicon them together. I would have returned them with a nice note but it really isn't worth the trouble and time. I think they are probally banking that most people would feel that way. DO NOT BUY THIS! Spend alittle more money and get a better one. Thanks for listening.
1,"I don't know what the heck I""m doing wrong!",I don't know what the heck I'm doing wrong but I haven't seen a single bird at this feeder in the 5 months its been up on our window. The birds flock to the other hanging seed feeder hung at the same height in the garden and I have to fill it weekly. I'm still hoping they'll find this window feeder but I'm getting pretty discouraged.
1,Piece of junk,"What a piece of junk, it came broken! I would have sent it back but saw how cheap it was made and it wasn't even worth it. I grabbed some tape and used that to hold it together. I only got it so that my cat would have something to watch while I was gone so I guess that's OK, she will not care about the tape. Just the glass between them."
1,Missing Components,Mine came just as described but is missing the suction cups! This is very frustrating as it's now useless to me.
4,a Christmas present,I gave this as a Christmas present. It came promptly and was exactly as described. Very Satisfied. 4 stars since I didn't use it myself.
2,"Great feeder, but I haven't seen any birds","This feeder has done a great job of holding bird seed and staying on my window. Unfortunately no birds have used it. This might not be the fault of the feeder, as my other bird feeder has only had a squirrel visit it, but I haven't gotten what I expected from the feeder."
4,good for up close views,"This is a good, inexpensive feeder that sticks right on the window and provides nice up-close views of birds eating. I think my preference, however, is the hanging tube feeders mounted on a hanger that provides a view from the window. I am planning to order the Yard Butler Yard Tree Wall Mount with Two Hooks from Amazon to use in the window where this feeder currently is mounted. The Perky Pet Window Wild Bird Feeder is a little bit junky looking, as the plastic is taking on a whitish hue over time."
3,I agree - it's cheap . . . .,". . . but you get what you pay for, right? So, like many of the others commenting on this little feeder, mine arrived broken on one side. I invested in some gorilla glue, though, which appears to have done the job. It's now full of bird seed, and awaiting discovery. We'll see what the verdict is!"
4,Perky-Pet Window Wild Bird Feeder,"This is a cute little feeder. I thought our cat would love watching the birds come to our big picture window. However, we live in the woods and have tons of squirrels. The squirrels would get to it no matter where I put it and I never got to see a bird in it. While the squirrels knocked it off the window several times, it did NOT break. I think it would be great for some homes, just not ours!"
1,Poorly made,Ordered three of these feeders. One arrived with a crack along the seam. Another broke at the seam when positioning it on the window. These are not well made. I will try to reinforce the seams with heavy-duty tape.
1,broken and reglued,"Beware. I recieved this bird feeder and it was broken and had been sloppily reglued with crazy glue. It had fingerprints in the glue and was not fitted together. I would like them to send another , by cannot reach them. This obviously had been returned and not checked."
4,"Good Product, Fair Price","Overall, this is a nice little feeder at a fair price. Yes, it is plastic... $10 doesn't get you much more and, remember, it has to be light enough to stay on a window! As some of the negative reviews have noted, the pieces are not securely fitted. We solved this in a matter of seconds by running a thin line of Gorilla Glue down the seam. Problem solved!This is the second such feeder we've owned and we've had NO problems with either one sliding or falling, despite the earnest efforts of two pesky squirrels who can't take ""no"" for an answer! The design is especially good for using ""premium"" feed that includes larger nuts and fruit to draw prettier songbirds.Pros - Inexpensive. Easy to fill. Easy to ""install.""Cons - You may have to run a thin line of glue down the seam to keep it together.Recommended!"
4,Perfect window feeder,This is a great little feeder for a window. Simple basic design and it hasn't had a problem sticking to the window...even with birds in it! Thought we wouldn't have birds using it for at least 3 monthes...but they found it in 3 weeks! Just what we were looking for!
3,Good for the price,I just wanted to get a cheap feeder to entertain the cats. Figured if things work out I can buy a nicer one later. Its basically two pieces of plastic that are guided together with plastic pins. The suction cups hold the two halves together (once its actually stuck to the window). I found it to be a pain to hold together and stick to the window and have everything line up etc... Ended up putting some clear tape on front and back just to secure the halves a bit better and make it easier to put in place.
2,Owned for over a year ...,"and it was fine - when it stayed on the window. But I was constantly having to go out and fish it out of the landscaping, then reattach it to the window. I tried cleaning the window and the suction cups, and it still fell. As a result, I'm still looking for a window mounted feeder."
2,Would be great if I could put it on my window.,"I got this from my sister as a gift, when I received it it looked like it had been opened. I took out everything and I didn't get and suction cups to put it up!"
2,"it has been hanging on the window since Christmas and haven't seen one bird coming to eat, unexperienced design.",it has been hanging on the window since Christmas and haven't seen one bird coming to eat. Whoever designed this product might not know the bird and haven't been watching bird feeding. Great idea but poor result.
2,Cheaply made and do not stick to windows,"I have had two of these and both had the same problem. They both did not stick well to windows and both cracked in half. I duct taped one of them, and now I'm just giving up and buying something better."
2,Miss Noni,"Very cheaply made, came with only one of the two needed suction cups. I would not recommend this product."
4,Good little bird feeder,I think this is a good little bird feeder for the money. It seems to be staying up ok so far and is good for watching birds through the window.
3,Flawed packaging from the manufacturer,Was missing one of the suction cups. The other suction cup was sitting in the bottom of the bird feeder.
2,squirrel attractor,We loved it till the squirrel noticed it and started jumping on it trying to get to the food. The idea is great but you have to find a window that isn't near a tree with squirrels around.
5,Simple,"There are suction cups and a clear plastic enclosure. Not much to it. I like it, just waiting for more birds to come around to entertain my cat."
5,Kitty present !,"Got this for our kitties for Christmas, have it in the window but no birds yet......i'm sure they will find it this winter."
2,My birds don't like it,"I thought this would be great for our birds to feed at our window. But very few want to perch on it. Plus, it doesn't drain well. After one season, the plastic discolored, and the suction cups wouldn't stick to the window."
3,Ok for price,The suction cups seem to work but it doesn't hold much seed and it keeps coming apart where it separates for some reason in the middle.
3,Brittle in the cold,"The feeder is made of an acrylic plastic. And when exposed to the cold of 20 degrees, it becomes rather brittle. Wife stuck it to the glass and did not like the position it was in. She removed it and the feeder fell out of her hands. After the fall she noticed that the tabs on the bottom had snapped off and it would not hold seed any more.I fixed it with Duct tape and stuck the feeder on the new position."
5,window bird feeder,"This is one great little bird feeder for the money. I bought 2. Have had one before and it lasted five years. The price is right and the birds love it. Cardinals, finches and tufted titmice are a few of the birds that have visited the feeder."
2,Missing pieces,"I bought two of these cute bird houses and they came boxed seperately. Each box stated that suction cups were included, yet neither box contained suction cups. The bird house is useless until I can track some down in the right size and pay extra for them. Skip these."
4,Good but no birds are coming,Good product even though the window pump is not very good.We have tons of birds in the backyards but none of them have come to these
5,A great little feeder,"Length:: 0:04 MinsI have been pleasantly surprised with this little feeder. As you can see in the video clip, the feeder can be filled to the brim with seeds and hold 2 birds and still not fall. In fact, I have had two of these feeders on my windows for well over three months and have yet to have them fall off. The birds enjoy eating out of these feeders - despite the fact our cats leap into the window trying to attack them. They provide hours of entertainment."
4,Buy Some Window Tint,Length:: 1:45 MinsI appliedInsta-Cling Extra Dark Professional Tint Filmto the INSIDE of my window. I can get up close without the Birds seeing in.
3,Thank God for Somewhat Gentle Mail Carriers,"I bought this a second time for a friend of mine because she liked mine so much. This one, however, came in just a flattened bubbled envelope with no protection, box was beat up, suction cups outside of box loose in envelope. It's kind of a cheap plastic so I was worried the birdhouse was going to be busted up too - it wasn't, thank God. I felt a little embarrassed to give my friend such a beat up looking package but she still loved it. Would be nice if the seller could have taken a little more care in packaging."
4,It Sticks,"Bought this for Christmas for the cat. I was doubtful it would stick to the window through New England freeze/thaw cycles and snow, but it has been up for several weeks and holding on just fine. A few small birds come by but do get scared off if we move close to the window. The cat stares intently when a bird is in the feeder. Overall I had low expectations and have been pleasantly surprised by how well it is working."
2,Disappointing product,"I loved this window feeder when I first got it, but after only a few weeks one suction cup wouldn't hold it in place. I kept cleaning the window and slightly dampened the suction cups (as suggested). It finally fell to the ground and broke. I loved it while it lasted because seeing the birds right outside the kitchen window was wonderful. I'm not sure if I will ever try another window feeder that uses suction cups."
4,"Good quality, good price","Of all the transparent bird feeders on the market, this is the best value. In 2009 I bought one at an ACE hardware for around $14, which I thought was too expensive for a piece of plastic and a couple suction cups. But it held up well! In 2011, cherry-headed conures (wild parrots of San Francisco) started visiting my home, so I bought two more feeders to entice them to visit daily. The suction cups support up to two parrots on this little feeder! Very impressive. And the seed capacity is ample enough--I have to refill only weekly. Most user images show dirty feeders; if you wash them, they look nearly new! Very clear. My two-year-old feeder from ACE looks almost as good as my new ones from Amazon."
3,Bird feeder,I am still waiting for the first bird to arrive. Feeder is not attracting any activity...not one seed has been removed!
2,It fell within 10 minutes and broke,"I was pretty excited about this. I put it on my kitchen window, put seed in it, and I don't think a bird even touched it. A few minutes after I stuck it to the window I heard something fall. I looked out, and it was on the ground. The pins that held it together were broken, so it wouldn't stay together anymore.I'll probably try to glue it together & try again because I really liked the idea, but it didn't stay on the window as well as I had hoped."
3,one bird at a time,great little starter.. one bird at a time. poor little guys wanted to get in there so bad! Took a long time for them to discover it. Now i just upgraded to a pole and platform. Bring it on!
4,Excellent book but needs updating,In the time of the publication of this book it was a great resource for anyone who had an interest in the American government and government related history. I'd love to see an updated version of it. This was shipped timely and was in the condition reported by the seller.
4,A Good Pack,"Comfortable to wear. Built sturdy.Waist straps have elastic bands to keep the straps from getting caught in everything if you don't use them. This also functions to keep them out of the way. Goggle pocket slowly unzips itself everything I take the pack off.Really kinda small to be a college pack. Fits a laptop, a two inch binder, and a 1 in binder tightly with 4-5 inches of height to spare in main pouch. Secondary pouch can fit an additional 1 in binder. Side pockets can hold the laptop charger and mouse nicely.Have not yet used pack for hauling a board up a mountain yet... should be able to do that within a few months.Great for carrying a lite to medium volume of stuff."
2,"cool backpack, poor quality","We got this backpack in Mid April. In Early June, the zipper on the side pocket broke off rendering that space now useless. We love the colors and it's a pretty good size for school and PC, but I'm really disappointed in the zipper coming off so easily with just regular use. If there was a way to get it replaced or repaired then the rating would go much higher."
5,lightweight and just big enough,"very light, just big enough to hold a 15.6"" laptop, several different pockets, waist belt, good quality, very comfortable, slim (doesn't bulge out and look stupid)"
4,Wonderful!,"I have a bad lower back, so I really needed a backpack that would distribute the weight of all my textbooks well, and this is great! The waist strap is amazing and puts the weight on your hips instead of your shoulders and lower back.I'm pretty small (5' 2""), so the shoulder straps fit a little oddly which was annoying, but this backpack totally redeemed itself when I went grocery shopping and piled a week's worth of food into it and biked home. It was really heavy, but it didn't hurt my back! Success!With my previous backpack with laptop case (Dakine Campus Laptop Pack), actually putting the laptop in made it fit weirdly and be really heavy, so I hardly ever used it. I think that will change with this new one!"
4,Dakine Mission Pack,"I have now had this pack for about a month and use it primarily as a book bag. It is well constructed and very comfortable. I have the Denim finish and it looks pretty sharp. I have enjoyed the laptop pouch and the various compartments on the side. The bag is slightly taller and slimmer than I expected, but certainly has enough room to haul around textbooks and my laptop. The one thing I miss from my old pack is a quick access water bottle pouch. I have not attempted to strap a skate or snowboard to the front, so cannot comment on that element of the bag."
4,Very nice backpack,My husband really loves this backpack. It is comfortable and has a place to hold his laptop. It's a little small though (for college) and the 'Carbon' color is NOT for men. I was shocked when I opened the inside and saw maroon and pink!! Luckily he didn't mind though..it still bother me though.
5,Primal Awareness will make the world a better place to live.,"Although some articles have been written about what is happening to my people regarding the drugs, lumbering and violence, only Don Jacobs has captured the spiritual understandings that have allowed us to live in balance for thousands of years. As a recipient of the Goldman Environmental Award, as the Directorof the Sierra Madre Alliance and as a half-Raramuri Indian, I can say without reservation that Primal Awareness will help make the world a better place if enough people read it. I agree with Dan Millman's review of the book when he said it is a 'suspsne story that embraces realms of psychology,anthropology and magic.'"
2,caught up in mysticism,"although my rating of two stars is in sharp contrast to the others before me, i feel there are only small discrepencies between our reviews. i am fascinated with native american culture, namely sioux, and have just began what i hope to be a long lifetime of learning about such an interesting people. however, i feel that don jacobs focuses on a divergent but related topic to the point of losing his aim: mysticism. apart from believing in the unseen, i am a scientist at heart, as i can only assume many other readers identify themselves as. i literally couldnt finish this text, although i did enjoy most of what i read. telepathically communicating with horses, depicting clarevoyantism as real, being jack london's reincarnate!! such fanciful and superstitious thinking. in short, if you have an inclination to such metaphysics, this book is appropriate; otherwise, look elsewhere."
4,Worth a view on a slow friday evening,"I enjoyed watching this movie, and would recommend it to friends. I rented this movie because I love Will Arnett from his work in Arrested Devolpment and look forward to seeing him in Blade's of Glory. Anyway, in short, this movie is just a silly movie with absurd, funny events happening in a prison in the larger context of a the main character, John (Dax Shepard, who I also enjoyed in Employee of the Month) trying to make Nelson's (Will Arnett) life miserable. Some funny twists in the plot kept me watching and laughing.Although not the best movie I have seen, it is worth renting and maybe watching in a large group since it is not vital that you pay close attention and catch everything, but still has some funny moments."
1,Oh man I am glad I didn't see this in theatres.,Rented the movie because I wanted to see it in theaters but sadly it stopped showing in my area after one week. Now I know why. Horrible movie. Not really funny and just plain out bad.
2,Not the best comedy of the year...,"Not an entirely great movie. Movie is about a man who has been in jail three times, sentenced by the same judge everytime. When he gets out for the third time, he wants revenge on the judge who sentenced him, but finds out that the judge has recently died. So, he decides to get revenge on the judge's son by sending him to jail. However, he also does something to get himself arrested and sentenced to several years in prison so that he can be there while the judge's son serves his time.Basically, the whole movie is about life in jail and how this man tries to make the judge's son have a horrible time in prison. It goes from fights, to homosexuality, deaths, etc. Anything that you might expect to happen in prison does, so its not a big surprise.The movie is not really that funny, there are only a couple of times when you laugh, but not all that much. Don't really recommend it and its not a movie to remember."
1,prison,"was pushed to by this. watched and gave it away. This movie wasn't my type, it might be yours"
1,Wait for the cable version,"From the promos, it seemed like this would be a very funny movie. It was not. I laughed in only a few instances (which were the same ones aired in the promos). My advice is to save your money and not buy the movie. Instead, rent it or wait for the cable release."
4,Funny!!,This movie was really funny!!! It's definitely not going to win any academy awards but provided us with plenty of laughs.
4,"hilarious, worth a rental at the very least, but i bought it","Lets Go To Prison is one of the best comedies of the last few years. it breaks away from the formula of the average comedy, takes you into a serious world, but in a ridiculous way. Dax Shepherd has quickly become a favorite of mine as well, he narrates and is one of the 2 main characters. if you're a fan a movies like Waiting, or Mel Brooks films, just stupidly funny movies, you'll like this."
4,Tacky but really funny,First let me say my husband convinced me to watch this a while back. I reluctantly agreed. I am so glad I did. I ended up ordering a copy to watch when I need a laugh.
1,Do NOT waste your time,"I was really disappointed with this movie.I was thinking it would be hilarious because it was directed by the guy from Mr. Show,boy was I wrong.This movie sucks big time!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Idiotic and unoriginal,"I tried to watch this one because my girlfriend says I need to watch more comedies. This garbage reminded me why I don't watch many comedies. Fans of stupid humor will enjoy. If you have half of a working brain, you will most likely turn it off."
3,humorous but not hilarious,"This light comedy manages to draw on some harsh reality of prison while still being immensely funny and entertaining. Parts of it are quite funny, whereas other parts are complete of silly humour. All in all, a nice DVD rental."
1,Let's go to Prison,"Let's go to Prison is a Bad movie, only show up the Prison's reality, that everybody knows, and it is not necessary to show again. This movie must be restricted for under 18."
5,Funny Stuff,"My granddaughter recommended this dvd; so I ordered it. It is truly one of the funniest dvds I have seen in a while. I watch it when I've had a depressing day, and it works!"
1,Don't waste your money on this one!,Quentin Lee resorts to cliché cinematic techniques in a vain attempt to pump life into a dull boring script. Thank goodness for the fast forward button!
1,Definitely not for beginners,"Although the cover and introduction made this book seem like it would be a good way to learn basics, reading it really was not a lot of help. The book repeatedly uses terms without defining them, and changes subjects with little transition. I feel no better prepared to learn golf than I did before I read this book.Other gripes:The book has Augusta National described as being in Atlanta, Georgia, instead of in Augusta, Georgia.As the chapters wore on, it became a lot more about Gary Player and what Gary Player thought than about golf in general."
3,An in-depth analysis,"This is a sociological work which may seem a bit tedious to the general reader; however, it is carefully researched, and useful to those interested in more in-depth studies of cross-cultural communication. Gorden focused on a particular circumstance--young North American students living with middle-class urban Colombian families--and explored the points of view of both sides. As a North American who has some experience in Latin America, I found that some of the information can be applied to other countries as well."
3,You get what you pay for.,"The quality is not the best but it was only $8.99 at that price I can use it for a while and toss it when it gets bad. It works well, it doesn't stick and seems to distribute the heat evenly. My only problem is the rim of the pot has rough spots and is missing some of the coating. Other than that it is pretty well made. I have used it several times now and have not had any problems. The glass lid has a steam hole that I really like and wish some of my more expencive cookware had one. All in all it's not so bad and will be used often."
5,A good buy,"Although this is strictly an ANODIZED cookware, not a nonstick pot, since I do not use it to fry food, it works very well for me. I would say that the pan is well designed and appears to be high quality."
5,I really liked this pan,I was surprised at the quality of this pan for the price. I really liked the measuring markings on the inside of this pan. It is very easy to clean.
1,110% Pure Junk,If it sounds like it is too good to be true it probably is! This stuff was scratched and dented right out of the box. It is another example of the garbage from Chinese manufacturers that pervades our market.Anodized coating is not hard nor thick enough---will not last.
5,follow up to the first book,Great follow up to the original CURVES book that distills the Curves approach to getting and staying fit and healthy. Easy to reference and ready to fill in and use daily. I do wish they had printed this in a binder style format so it lays flat-easier to write in or copy a page. People really need to read this and understand what is being presented here-it is profound. Imagine raising your metabolism and caloric intake!! Way cool! No more yo-yo-ing!
2,expensive,"this book is only small, the larger book is much better and contains all the information from this one."
5,Love this book,I got my book came in the mail within a few days of purchasing it. I am very happy with the seller.
2,"Too Much Archaeology, Not Enough Schliemann","According to Traill, Schliemann was not only a generally unpleasant character, but a liar and a cheat as well. Traill wants to dislike Schliemann, and he succeeds. Is the author biased, as a previous reviewer believes, or was Schliemann really such a rat? It's hard to trust this writer.It was a struggle to get through this book. I wanted a life of Schliemann without so much about the technicalities of archaeology, which I found confusing and uninteresting. Only brief glimpses of Schliemann the human being appear."
2,"Oh, the horror!","This book is easy to put down and never pick up again. Yet, it's disturbing enough that you'll never forget it. Anyone with the slightest interest in archeology will forever cringe when encountering the name ""Schliemann."" He destroyed so much while searching in all the right places. But hindsight, perhaps, has been unfair to him. Still, this book isn't that interesting of a read."
4,I love Fushigi Yugi,"The art work of Watase Yu is fabulous. The stroy is facinating. It made me laugh in places. Of cousrse it's funny considering your main characters are a 15 year old clueless junior high girl who is a glutton, a cute miser, a narasasic emporer and . . . I won't give it away. It's like Inuyasha by Rumiko Takahashi, in that the girl is taken back in time. Howere unlike Inuyasha, the girl is sucked into a book and is the hero of the story. In Inuyasha the main character time travels through a well. In this story Miaka becomes part of the story. I liked the paradies and the Manga talks. This is a great story. Even thought in palces in the translation they call Miaka the princess even though she is the priestess (Suzaku no Miko). But besides that it was wonderful. I definatly recomend this one. The anime is good but the manga is way better. Its a good story and it has lots of cute guys."
5,IN ADDTION... ^o^,"Oh, yeah, if you really like these conflicts in Fushigi Yuugi, maybe you'd also like to read X and something like ""the Holly Biography"" by CLAMP. These two have even more complex stories than Fushigi Yuugi, and they deal with both individuals and social problems..."
5,THE BEST,"Ceres and Fushigi Yugi are the best mangas of all time! I am totally hooked! The drawing is so good, and so is the plot. It takes a lot of imagination and detail, and a lot of effort, and it shows."
1,FY Uncut please.,"Yes, this book is fun to read... However, not only are the scans not up to par in some pages but (here was a shocker for me)THE CHAPTER TITLE PAGES WERE MISSING!!!!!!!EVERY ONE!Instead of this, they just put the chapters title right into the manga on the first scene. Yuu Watase usually puts an establishing shot (such as trees) in the first frame, and they put the chapter title there instead of using her cover pages. I was really angry when I saw this and I will reconsider buying the rest of this manga. It is already very expensive and they do this sort of thing to save themselves money. I will put this review for each book that I have. I encourage people not to review this translation so highly because manga should be uncensored when it comes into publication in english.Note: After complaining to Viz, I am happy to report that the end result is a newer publication of FY which has all the pages. Thanks viz!"
5,"Exquisite artwork, and captivating story","Yu Watase has to be my favorite manga artist of all time because her illustrations are beautifully detailed. This series is a mythical tale of the adventures of Miaka (aka Suzaku no Miko)and her gorgeous (**drools** ^_~) seishi as they try to summon the god Suzaku. In this installment Miaka must find a way out of the book, Hotohori's attempts to gain Miaka's love continue, the hiliarious truth about Nuriko is revealled (if you really want to enjoy this DON'T GET SPOILERS - I did, and do I ever regret it!) Tamahome realizes his true feelings for Miaka, and Yui gets lost inside the story. If you are looking for a manga with beautiful pictures, romance, humour, plenty of bishonen, war, frienship and betrayal (in other words a GREAT story) get this series. You won't regret it."
4,A must for the FY aficionado!,"After watching the spectacular Fushigi Yuugi TV series, it was really interesting to read the manga. I especially like how in every chapter (there are six) creator Yu Watase holds sort of an open forum, talking about her motivation, her character creation, etc. I can't wait until volumes 4,5 nd 6 come out!"
5,Excelente,Equipo rústico y confiable de fácil uso y calibraciónLo recomiendo lleno totalmente mis expectativas.Lo utilizo desde hace 02 años.
4,Belle not so Beautiful,"The figurines are all very nice with the exception of Belle herself which is not so graceful or pretty. I admit I bought it for the Beast so my daughter could use it with another Belle she has, but the manufacturere should have done a better job making Belle more attractive."
2,Disappointing and at times annoying,"I had read wonderful reviews of this book, but was very disappointed. The hero was strong, but the heroine was a drip. She felt she was different from everyone else because of her experience and her Indian clothes and nose stud. HELLO! Take the stud out, I kept saying, and put some regular clothes on unless you want everyone to treat you like an oddity. The hero kept quoting poems and stuff at length, which I suppose was interesting the first 2 or 3 times, but after about the 20th time, I just started skipping around it."
2,Not one of my favorites,"I was very dissappointed with this book. The heroine has no personality, and the hero's dialogue I found annoying. I was gritting my teeth with every ""Good Lord"" or ""My God"", and don't get me started with all his quotes. It was a struggle to finish."
5,Wonderful Game------DONT BE AFRAID XP USERS,"Great product. You can get into the engineers seat of a train, such as subways, freight, and passenger trains. This is the same game as the train simulator(link here:Train Simulator), but updated for xp. Great game for anyone who wants to have some fun with trains, and wants a real situation experience."
4,Fun for 'kids',"My husband is a train buff. He had hours and hours of fun with this game. He acts like he's really piloting a train. It's fun to watch this man act like a little kid. It's probably fun for kids, too."
2,"Well, it has trains",This was not what I really expected. It was fun for about an hour and then I uninstalled it and moved on.
5,Delicious!,Delicious beyond words. Melt in your mouth. Arrived in perfect condition and quickly. UK chocolate is different to U.S. chocolate and in my opinion much yummier!
4,Nice to see the D&H Vollrath steam collection in print...,"Nice little book. Worth the money I spent. Great to see much of the old Harold Vollrath D&H; steam collection in print. Would have been nice to see more Penn Division images, but you get what you get.MF"
3,"Small book, and helpful with some translations","This is a small 5-inch book that has many translations. The only thing it doesn't have is reflexive verbs, future tense, I/You/He/She/Us/ You(plural)/They/ translations which is needed to know in the Italian language. It does provide english-italian translations, but it does not have the definition to the words. I use this some book to help me with my Italian homework and works most of the time."
5,"Solid, durable, and practical","Our family has been using these Libbey Gibraltar glasses for years. The design is classic and the quality is top-notch. They are nice and heavy, so they are less prone to being tipped over by kids or pets. The ridges help hands of all sizes keep a good grip on the glass. And they stand up to washing after washing in the dishwasher. Another reviewer said not to stack them, but we've been stacking these glasses two-high (upside down) in our kitchen cabinets for years without any problem. I've seen the glasses for less at other stores (Bed Bath & Beyond, for one), but the convenience of ordering them online with free shipping from Amazon.com (I'm a Prime member) is very nice. I actually have a reserve supply of these glasses in the basement, just in case of breakage. That's how much we like them! Highly recommended."
5,Bistro-Style Glasses,"These are beautiful, durable, and heavy, a nice trifecta for an everyday item. I have had a glass phobia for years after our Venezuelan exchange student cut his hand on glass, and my mom got a horrible cut on her hand from a shattering glass as she removed it from the dish drainer. Seeing two people you love go to the ER and needing stitches from glasses freaked me out for years, to the point that I banned real glass glasses. But...I missed real glasses that somehow make everything taste and look better. These are perfect for safety, looks, and functionality. Quite heavy, which is why the 14-ounce juice size is perfect. Glass is back, baby!"
5,Made in USA. Great Quality.,My wife usually buys things for the kitchen. I always have to buy the glasses I like.You can jam the Libbeys into the dishwasher without them breaking like other glasses we have used.
5,Glasses,I purched these glasses to replace ones that have been broken. My wife and I chose this style since it is so popular. They are nery nice glasses.I am very happy that I got them.
5,A Must Read For Anyone In Manufacturing!,"As a Continuous Improvement Technician with many years of mechanical and production experience, I found ""Lean Manufacturing for the Small Shop"" the best guide I have read for the implementation of lean manufacturing principles for any small to medium size manufacturing facility. It's strength lies in its easy to understand principles as well as the examples and instructive aids that can be used in any company. I feel it should be required reading for any manager or facilitator of lean manufacturing. Martin L. Espinola Continuous Improvement Technician Clear Pine Mouldings, Inc"
2,Design Flaw?,This is the third time replacing this part. The plastic gear teeth on the bottom break especially when blending something cold. I think the cold makes the plastic brittle. Good for sales though...
2,poor quality,"This item broke after 4 uses. The teeth on the bottom, which would connect with the base and turn the blades, was plastic with a short lifespan"
1,broke my blender,"I ordered this replacement blade assembly after the blades that had worked well for me for several years turned so that they weren't at a 90 degree angle anymore. Unfortunately the part they sent me was defective, and wouldn't turn, which promptly burned out the motor on my blender.Fortunately, this led me to order a refurbished KitchenAid 5-speed blender, which is by far the best blender I've ever owned. If you like super-thick smoothies, skip the replacement part and buy a better blender!"
1,DOA,"The replacement blade broke after one use. The bearings started leaking. No more replacement blades for me, I'm switching brands."
2,fits the blender exactly but the teeth are still breaking,"I've had my blender two years or so and just had to replace this part for the same reason as most here; the broken plastic teeth. I was happy to see this part fit my blender perfectly, and less expensive than the Braun website was charging for the part. After whipping up only a few smoothies (with small pieces of frozen fruit and no ice) I inspected the plastic teeth. Three are broken already. So this is a very temporary solution. When the rest give out, I will be getting a new blender. What a disappointment."
1,Stop buying these and just buy another blender,I went through three of these before the motor died. Get another blender instead.
2,"If it were made better, it would last longer","I am on my second replacement blade. The reason for failure has always been the same: corrosive moisture (usually some of the blended fluid) seeps into the blade's bearing and destroys it with time by diluting the bearing's lubricant.This could of course be prevented by using a better-made, more heat-resistant seal for the bearing, but that... would cost money!So- why should Braun spend more on a better seal when the original seal usually will last at least until the blender's warranty is up? Here we have the plight of most modern consumer goods in a nutshell."
2,Mediocre blade for a mediocre blender,"I gave up on the blender this is designed for after I broke 2 of these blade assemblies. The problem is that it has a weak plastic clutch on the bottom, which engages the blender base drive element. Put any significant torque on this, e.g. chopping ice for margaritas/daiquiris, and it'll break in no time."
1,Doesn't work,This part worked just once when I tried it. After that it didn't spin at all. Seems like here has been used very cheap material or it just me are so unlucky.
5,Blender blade,"A perfect fit, it is exactly what I needed, so far so good, we will see how long it lasts."
4,Blade is as described,The blades were as described. It would have been nice if it included the rubber washer gasket also. The picture and ad showed the blades without the washer as described.
1,It doesn't seem to help,"I've been studying this book for weeks, but no matter what I do I can't seem to get it right. First of all, my ""potty"" doesn't look like the one in this book. I even went to an appliance store, and showed them the book so I could purchase the right one, but they couldn't understand what I was talking about. This book has caused me nothing but grief. Without the right ""potty"", I guess I'll just have to constuct my own, using wattle and pitch. If only they put out a companion volume to this: ""Once Upon a Potty for Dummies"", then I would be all set..."
1,Do NOT read this to your children,"I am trained as a psychologist, with over 2 decades of experience with children, and when I read this book the first time, I gasped in horror. Yes, I admit it could have been worse, but still unacceptable.Although, you can find opinions on both sides, referring to a penis as a ""pee-pee"" is not to be taken lightly. I find the ""cutesy"" term ""pee-pee"" detrimental. At least the author has the good sense not to say ""naughty bits.""In my opinion, a child's sexuality is greatly influenced by language, as does all cognition.I returned the book, and my nephew will not be subjected to this."
3,Cute book,"This is a cute book that my 2 year old really seems to enjoy, but I wouldn't say that it is really teaching him to want to use the potty any more than he already did. When Joshua, the little boy in the book, gets his own potty, the book goes through several pages of Joshua wondering what the potty is. After the first read through, my son was asking if we could skip those pages because he already knew it was a potty! I do like that it goes through the different parts of the body and tells what they are for. My son says, ""Joshua has eyes like me! Joshua has hands like me! He has a wee-wee like me!"" I think maybe if we'd gotten the DVD in conjunction with the book, it might have been more helpful."
3,Not as good as other potty training books,"My two year old son isn't as interested in me reading this book as other potty books. I heard the Once upon a Potty book for a girl was great, so I bought this one for my son, but I'm not too impressed."
2,Unsure,"I like the straightforward way the book explains the learning process behind potty training. However, I'm very put off by the ""potty"", which is, in actuality, a pot. Historically accurate, yes, but hardly applicable to today's world. My son, after reading the book several times, pointed to the giant potted tree we have in the living room, looked at me and said ""Potty?""Um, no, honey.I also have started from a very young age with my boys teaching them anatomically correct words for their body parts. We use ""stomach"", ""penis"", and ""buttocks"" or ""bottom"". I really dislike the usage of the words ""pee pee"", ""poo poo"" and ""wee wee"".I understand this is personal preference, but if your preferences are like mine, you should know."
4,Great pictures for the toddler to enjoy!,"While Mommy is reading the book, in easy words for toddler to understand, he can enjoy the pictures! Your child can relate himself to ""Joshua"" and try and do the same things as him. This book is highly recommended! There is no stress whatsoever on your child."
3,Language disappointing,I was disappointed with the language used in this book. Wee-wee and Poo-Poo are not the terms we use to refer to bodily functions. The story and illustrations did hold my sons attention - I made appropriate changes to match the language we use for body parts and functions.
1,Buyer's remorse,"Do not purchase this book. I looked for a few books to get my son excited about potty training. I don't consider myself to be an ultra conservative type, but after the first few pages I was appalled. I've read this book to my son once. Even my 10 year old daughter was disgusted by the book when she heard me reading it to my son.This book did not catch my son's attention, for many reasons - I am sure. The illustrations were very bland. The book reads more like a textbook (with the exclusion of proper names for body parts). I think the author was more worried about being gramatically correct then having a fun to read book with an enticing cadence. One last thing... How can we expect our child to relate to Joshua's potty experience when his potty looks more like a bowl, large planter or old school pitcher?"
1,Dated and not helpful,"Ummm. Potties don't look like ceramic old-fashioned chamber pots any more.My three year old likes the story and the video, but it seems to be a waste of time in helping his toilet training. You might as well read Dr. Seuss and avoid having to read phrases like ""poo-poo"" and ""pee-pee"" and ""the little hole in his bottom where the poo poo comes out"".I know I am attacking a classic, well-beloved book, and I don't have a better book to offer, but this out of date book does not charm me or help my kid.You'd be better off simply lovingly bringing your kid to the potty every waking hour than straining through this embarrassingly wretched book."
1,Boy neither wipes bottom nor washes hands,"In addition to the points raised by other reviewers regarding the illustration of the potty and the language used in the book, I am much troubled by the fact that the boy in the book neither wipes his bottom nor washes his hands after he uses the potty. Not the example I'd like my toddler to learn from."
1,I'd give it zero stars if I could,"Despite the high ratings this book seems to have gotten, I do not like it at all (and neither did the 26 month old I read it to -- and I even changed the words trying to make it better). First, the worst is the wording for the boy's anatomy: ""a pee pee to make wee wee."" As other ""one star"" reviewers commented, the ""potty"" looks like a pot or flower pot. The ""... and I, Joshua's mother..."" is terriby repetitive and serves no useful purpose. The red pages are not aesthetically pleasing. I was glad I checked this out of the library before purchasing it -- it went back to the library the next day (as did about 10 other potty training books for toddlers. They are horrendous! Two books that I did purchase -- and which are the only ones I've found that are any good are: ""The Potty Book for Boys"" by A. Capucilli and ""Big Boys Use the Potty"" by DK Publishing.) Actually, I ended up writing my own and used Shutterfly to create it."
3,Strange looking potty,"I agree with other reviews that this is the strangest looking potty I've ever seen. This is not what any American potty looks like. However, my 23 month old son likes to read about Joshua, and he likes to look at the pictures of the poo-poo in the diaper, and the poo-poo in the potty, and the poo-poo in the big potty. Now he likes to look at his poo-poo in the potty before we flush it down the toilet. But he's still not potty trained."
3,Cute but what is that potty chair?,"We've used both the boy and the girl book with our kids. It's pretty much like every other potty chair book out there. Kid wears diapers. Potty enters the scene, after trial and error, success.My kids loved the 'nekkid' body parts pages, which are cute and unoffensive and I think an important part of the book. My only beef is with the potty chamber pot or whatever the heck it is. It looks like a water pitcher or something. I'm going to be careful where I leave my coffee cup! :)I almost want to cut out a picture of our potty chair from a catalog but that would just distract him more. All in all though a good book."
3,very similar to a book i own,"Bought this book while trying to train my son Joshua. The character in the book is Joshua, too, so I thought my son would like it...After reading several times, I couldn't help by notice it is very much like ""the potty book"" that I bought a year ago! Although this book is much older, it seems someone else thought it was good enough to copy!My son does like it, but not enough to go potty on the toilet full time!!!"
2,Where's the Dad in this book?,"Although the book is good in many ways, it never once mentions the toddler's Dad. His mother is the only one who changes him, is proud of his use of the potty etc. etc. Very disappointing."
1,"OK, my son loved it. . .",". . . but GAK to the language in here (""..."").I would rather change diapers for an extra year than read this, and my son downs a lot of fiber, if you catch my drift."
1,Awkward!,"This whole book seems to be written for a different time. The potty they have looks like a flower pot. We found that we had to reword most of the dialog to make it appropriate for our family which is fine, but why not just buy a different book."
2,I am very disappointed with this book.,"I had heard so many wonderful things about this book, so I ordered it without ever seeing it. I find the way this book is worded to be annoying and difficult to read. Saying, ""And I Joshua's mother"" instead of simply saying, ""Joshua's mother"", grows tiresome. One entire page says nothing more than, ""and sat and sat"" over and over. Was the author really expecting us to read that 50 times, wouldn't 3 times suffice?The illustrations are attractive and my son likes the book, so we 'read' it while he is sitting on the potty. ""And I as his mother"" have changed the wording to make it tolerable for me."
2,I'm with David Swanson here...,"...I found it tediously written, with the constant whiny self-references: ""I, Joshua's mommy..."" [or at least that's how the Hebrew version went]. In my experience, no book every helped any of my kids toilet train. That's not Frankel's fault, but when I hear accolades, I at least expect a clever book, even if it didn't help in my particular case."
4,Great source,"My son's pediatrician recommended both the book and video to start the potty training. My son loves them, especially the video. He sings the song and repeats the story, which has helped him to get closer to the concept of the potty. He is not totally trainned yet but the book and video have helped tremendously"
2,Cute but not an attention getter,My son doesnt like this book much. I think its because of the pictures.They just arent colorful enough.The storyline is good.
2,Terrible,"This is possibly the worst book ever written to help potty train children. No child with an IQ of over 65 could sit through the whole thing. It is wordy, boring, and outdated. The illustrated ""potty"" the child uses looks like a giant mixing bowl, and my 2.5 year old totally called me on it."
2,A little too explicit,"This book is a little to explicit and ""colorful"" showing the potty (the pictures of the poop and pee-pee). My son is having a hard time understanding what the potty in the book actually is because is looks like a pitcher."
3,Good Content,"The book has good content, but the ""Potty"" looks nothing like a toilet or a potty chair. My 28 month old son gets a little confused when I tell him that is the potty."
3,"Fun Book, But Not What I'd Consider A Teaching Tool","I really enjoy reading ""Once Upon A Potty"" to my kids. It's rather direct and features gender-specific illustrations of the ""parts"" for boys and girls. This particular book features the male anatomy of little Joshua. Joshua's story gives children the confidence to sit and wait for something to happen, even if it doesn't feel like something will occur.I personally don't consider this book a good teaching tool for potty training. While it's a fun story and does get rather specific about body parts, it doesn't teach little boys how to stand when urinating. As others have stated, the illustrated potty is a ""wee"" bit outdated as well.Still, kids will have fun with this book and I do mildly recommend it. Some parents might think that terms like wee-wee, poo-poo and pee-pee are too childish for their children, but I think they're just fine for the little ones."
1,Not crazy about this book.,"I bought this book based on reviews I read, here and elsewhere, to start the potty training process with our son. I read it and just didn't like it but figured if my son likes it and it works we'll keep at it. He doesn't like it and up until this book we have yet to find a book he doesn't like."
2,Don't waist your money,"This is one of four books about the potty I got for my 18 month old son. He has very little interest in it, it is long and has 4 pages showing the baby playing with the potty. As well as a page with him missing the potty (with pee and poop). Also, the potty is a flower pot. Very strange. You would do much better getting ""Potty"" (by Leslie Patricelli board books) this is a much better book and my son loves it."
5,Very Infomative,"This was great! I bought it off the culturegram website for 3 dollars because I was doing a geography project on China, and it was the best resource I had! It had all the information written in a way so if you needed to do a last minute reading on one part, you could find it quickly. Very, Very good."
3,Just okay,"These episodes were produced and acted well, but the story lines are really kind of lame. Really a little boring."
3,The History of the 71st Infantry Division,"If grandpa was in the 71st Infantry Division during WW2 and you want to find out what he did, or you were in the Division and want to find out what you did, then this is the book for you. It is a nuts and bolts history of the Division covering inception, training, deployment and combat, most of which was in the very latter part of the war in Europe. Of unusual aviation historical interest, the book states that on March 13, 1945, the Division suffered its first casualties near Montbrunn when four captured American P-47 fighters flown by German pilots straffed soldiers of the 66th Infantry, killing two and wounding three others. The Division goes on into heavy fighting and provides a view of the last months of combat in Germany and beyond to the East. Many b/w photos and interesting sketches and maps. Lists of those KIA, and awarded medals are provided. The book was published in 1946, so only the war is covered. Interesting reading."
3,Chinese Printer Does Weak Job,"I picked up the hardcover version of this book at my comic shop this weekend. Overall impressions: a very good selection of material and good accompanying text, but the entire production is marred by a lackluster printing job by the Chinese printer. The lack of sharp focus and vibrant colors make a disappointment of some of my most fondly remembered Adams works, such as the famous Dracula Lives cover. Similarly, the reproduction of pencils doesn't begin to approach the beauty of the original publications. Buy this book as a checklist for revisiting the original printings of the featured works."
1,"She didn't break the rules, they broke her...please","This was one of the most tedious,tiresome books I have read in years...just getting past the flat characters, unnecessarily convoluted plot wasted too much time. I had to put it down half way through because I was absolutely bored to tears...I guess I broke first."
1,Disapointing,"As much as i wanted to enjoy this book I just could not get involved because of the convoluted and choppy structure. There were no real emotions to the characters, and the setting was flat and tedious."
1,Christian Book,I thought it was going to be about Revelations but it's about astrology which has no place in a christian book.
5,A great read!,"Robert FitzGerald has presented an amazing correlation between zodiac sign where the vernal equinox occurs along the ecliptic (which moves backwards due to the earth's tilt on its axis) and the developments of human culture. One can't help but notice the parallels; Cancer with house building and agriculture; Gemini with writing and the invention of the wheel and trading networks; Taurus with the worship of the Bull and Aries with the worship of the Ram and Pisces Fishes as a symbol for Christianity in this current age.Robert takes a general overview of man's history with the ages, and then he shows that there is a recurring golden age of culture based on smaller segments of time in the astrological model he presents. Overall a great read!"
5,Beatle Influence!,"I have loved this book since I was 5 and still have my treasured copy. The appeal for me was partly because of the title as the Beatles were nicknamed the Moptops.Martin, nicknamed ""Moptop"" (can't get past that Beatle influence)! refuses to get a haircut. When sent to the local barbershop, the boy whose hair was longer than any Beatle and wasn't even brushed or styled (and theirs WAS), hides in a store behind a mop barrel. A woman with reading glasses reaches into the barrel, thinking she's getting a mop and instead, gets the boy!Yowling with pain, the boy races off to the barbershop. While he's there, other things are being cut back as well -- the hedges; the newly mowed lawn; a dog was clipped as well as a tree. Too bad the boy didn't have his hair Beatle coiffed! The barber could have at least given the boy a Beatle haircut! While the boy looked better before the haircut, Beatle fans especially will appreciate this one!"
3,worked well,"strong & worked well, will have to see if the elestic can hold up over time.UPDATEthey have lost their elasticity, so I wish I could reduce the overall star rating."
3,So far so good,"I originally wanted the bongo ties, but when I read the construction on these I opted to try them instead. The bongo ties are made of rubber which weakens quickly in the sun and also sticks together. These ball bungees are made more like the actual bungee cord which is much more durable and so far they are just what I need.If I find a problem with them I will update this review, otherwise they are perfect for my use."
2,Mixed up order,"I just received my shipment, it arrived promptly. I ordered four items all of the same type,Neiko Heavy-Duty 9-Inch 'Bungee Ball' Elastic Cords - Set of 25, but received two different products. Two of the bags of 25 bungee balls look like the heavy duty ones I ordered. The other two bags are a 4 inch light-weight version. Looks like I will be sending two bags back. Looks like RT or Amazon needs to work on order fullfillment a bit more."
2,Mis-Labled Product,"I previously purchased this product about six months ago and use it regularly to bundle some photo stands and umbrellas. When I re-ordered the product, I asked for the 9 inch bungees and received 6 inch bungees which are too short for my application. The package was labeled 9 inch, but the product inside was 6 inch. I contacted the seller (not to get a refund, I can always find a use for the 6 inch bungees) to see if they had gotten a mis-labeled shipment and they told me all they had was the smaller size. But I see they are still advertising the 9 inch for sale."
2,Not enough bounce in my bungee,"I intended this product to hold up a sheet of plastic with the intention of protecting an inside wall from stacking firewood for the winter. The weight of the wood had already snapped two iron hooks from the wall so I wanted something with a little give in it. Well, I got precious little more give, but since no more hooks have broken, I cannot deny that they did the job required. I just think that a little more stretch would have made this product useful for more projects."
5,Bungee Balls,"We kept the Bungee balls as they were very well made and we needed them for the tarp that we have,that is about worn out.Thanks again Amazon for your quick response.You definitely have our business.Thanks again !!"
5,bungee cords for canopy,bungee cords provided for hanging our canopy are sturdy. Appear to be able to withstand the winds and rains expected.
2,Unable to finish,"Rarely do I have to set a book aside without finishing it, but that was the case here. Too many characters to keep track of, too many plots begun and then left as we turn to another character and subplot, and slow, ponderous writing throughout. The book had some original ideas, but a quarter of the way in I still didn't understand what was going on or what the subplots had to do with each other, so I gave up. An entertaining book should hit the ground running. This one didn't."
5,Military History Classic,"This is one of the classics of military history. It made Keegan's reputation now and forever. He takes three battles, from three different eras, and dissects them to understand what it would have been like to be there, to help the reader understand the experience of warfare.It is not only excellent history, it is also excellent writing. I cannot believe anyone could read it without being moved by it. It works on the heart as well as the head. It is the compassion, the humanity, that raises the book above the others in its field.Just wonderful."
5,Mr. Keegan's Opus,This is the first work that I and most others discovered Mr. Keegan's great mind for military history. It is an overview of the evolution of warfare from the middle ages to the present but more than that it seeks to answer the question of what motivates the common soldier to fight instead of following his instinct to run. Mr. Keegan's admiration and adoption of the common soldier's lot is moving and commendable in itself. He brings out the hero in the common man and for that all us common men can thank him.
4,Keegan Standard,"If you are going to start reading Keegan books then start with this one. His best work in my opinion. I read this book a long time ago, but revisited it recently to get Keegan's take on Agincourt. In this volume Keegan looks at warfare from a human perspective focusing on soldiers and less on leaders. It is a relatively easy read. If you have an interest in this subject of how battle's are fought and won then you should probably read this. Keegan is a great writer of military history. Originally published in 1976 this book is still a standard. The photos in the book are not that good, but it does have a few useful maps."
3,The Face of Battle,"The book is good, very vivid and intense. But the e-book editing is poor. All dashes (--) have become hyphens (-) glued between two words. Not a good reading, made me feel nostalgic of the paper books, which I am not.Best regardsClaudio Carina"
5,The Master of Military History,"John Keegan started somewhat of a revolution when he wrote the Face of Battle. Keegan took three great battles - Agincourt, Waterloo and the Somme - from three distinct eras and concentrated on the ""fog of war"". In other words, we don't get the feeling of great generals commanding heroically the pieces of a chess game, but rather are with the pawns as they are bounced cruelly about from life to death, from defeat to victory, often without discernment of where they are or how to seize an advantage. Keegan doesn't shrink from the carnage, nor does he dwell on it - he deals with it as the price or perhaps the definition of war. Subsequent Keegan works, although excellent all, have a hard time living up to this one; perhaps this is because he could only surprise us once with his knowledge of the military and his ability to alter perspectives. After that, we all expected it."
5,John Keegan is the best!!!,This is one of the best written books I have read. It is rife with history and filled with facts. It is an enjoyable and friendly read. This belongs on my bookshelf forever! This is one of the best books I have read!
4,Excellent early work,"I found this to be thoroughly researched, well-written, and focused. The book covers the aspects of combat facing the individual and the effects close combat has on the individual in ways few others try. A definitive work on the subject of personal combat experience."
4,What a strange book !,"First of all: The book's content is o.K. and provides a lot of information on Meg Ryan's life - private and work. Although some of the details seem to be ""borrowed"" elsewhere and do not match to other sources the author still tries his best to cover all you can get about actress Meg Ryan.It is a strange book (see my review title) because it seems to be ""handwritten"" in layout and style and the pictures are the worst copies I ever saw. The ""typewriting"" is hard to read because the quality is poor.Nevertheless: content is what counts - four stars..."
3,A great resource,This is a great book on IIS 5. It has easy to find config solutions which I like.Sean B. Hallidayhttp://www.thetricitiesbest.com
4,"Great for butterfly Watchers. But, no caterpillar pictures","I agree with the other reviewers who rated this reference book. It's got thousands of accurate butterfly pictures and it's loaded with information. Unfortunately, I was looking for a book that had a picture of the caterpillar beside each butterfly. This book does not and I am still looking for a book that does. Don't buy it if you need larval stage pictures. This book does not have those pictures."
4,Well organized reference,"This reference is easily used by a beginning non-professional as it contains the information in one place (unlike Peterson). Wish it had included the Caterpillar stages, but I suppose that is the topic for another reference source."
2,Something of a disappointment,"Americans are spoiled by beautiful and exciting butterflies. Europeans, on the other hand, are spoiled by good field guides to butterflies! This Kaufman guide is nothing compared with Tom Tolman's ""Butterflies of Europe"" or Björn Dal's ""Fjärilar i naturen"" (a Swedish work). My main objection to it are the illustrations. I'm not sure what on earth they are supposed to be. ""Digitally edited photos""? They are worse than painted illustrations, while not looking like photos either.Frankly, it's amazing that you can screw up a book about *butterflies*, making it aesthetically unpleasing. I'm sure the range maps and species presentations are good for beginners who want to identify butterflies, and with some imagination you might make something out of the digital photos too, but I long for the day when Tom Tolman or Björn Dal makes a trip to North America...You have longwings, swallowtails and milkweeds, and yet you blew it! REALLY."
5,"Comprehinsive, nice pictures and logically designed","In my humble opinion, most field guides are not logically designed. If you have a bird or butterfly in front of you, you may not have half an hour to thumb through the book looking for a likely suspect. This book has a few little aids that make searching faster and easier. The pictures are pretty good and show the tops and bottoms of the wings which is very important. Also important, it is complete. Most field guides leave a lot of butterflies out.I have four other field guides that are pretty much worthless. This is the best I've found so far."
4,Informative book on butterflies,This book has wonderful pictures and full descriptions of the butterflies. Any thing you might want to look up or study is in this book.
4,Great product,It is a very complete set of tools...Case has 4 latches so it is rigid.. money well invested...Good seller. You get what you paid.
1,Missing a piece.,It is missing one of the adapters. I haven't decided if it's worth sending back for a replacement or not. The problem is that I'm not exactly sure which exact piece it is.
4,Great set of tools.,"I agree with the previous reviewers that this is a great set of sockets and wrenches for working on your vehicle. Not only do I think so, but the person who broke into my vehicle and stole my last set must have thought so. I ordered a new set from Amazon to replace them, and have just received them. They arrived promptly.The reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 stars: I wish that I had gone to Walmart 1st. They are selling this same set of tools for $21 less. ($60.00)"
2,"Lovely to look at, but...","Sweet Dreams, Sam, with its colorful drawings and ""childfriendly"" pages will appeal to any small child. The book's short and imaginative text makes, for the most part, great bedtime reading. However, ""stars"" had to be taken away, in my opinion, because of the crocodile page. Do we want to tickle our small child's imagination with the thought of stretching out on a crocodile's back or playing with the snout of such a beast? I discarded the book because one of the first 10 lessons for my child's life is to instill a fright of the dangerous crocodile/alligator."
2,This Review Never Happened,"This is a decent introductory picture book, though it makes far too many assumptions regarding one's knowledge of philosophy and sociology prior to encountering this allegedly introductory text. References are made to the works Marx, Freud, etc., without ever attempting to explain the nature of such ideas. Even though this is a ""comic book,"" it is not wholly introductory in nature. Too bad. One is better off with Postmodernism for Beginners, even though it features only a small section on Baudrillard."
3,Not as good,"This one is not as good as ""The Art of God"". This one falls short in text and photos. There are some good things in here, but better to buy ""The Art of God"" and get excellent text as well as photos."
2,Fell apart on first use,"We bought this bag for a trip to Italy. After our first flight we found that the entire seam on the handle side had torn open exposing our whole stroller. Also there were holes worn through the bottom of the bag exposing the wheels. We continued to use the bag on the next 6 flights of our journey but had to get a luggage band to wrap around it to hold it together.For all of our layovers the airlines didnt realize that we needed it since it didnt LOOK like a strollerm and the airport employees arent paid to read that it says GATE CHECK, so we ended up wasting a ton of time at each layover trying to figure out where our stoller was, and even using rental strollers at the airports.I have not contacted the company yet, but I intend to. In the future I will purchase something more durable."
5,Great product for trips,"This is a great product for those with small children. We used this for our first trip with our 4 1/2 month old daughter. Easy to open and easy to store in the attached pouch. Everyone at the SW gate desk loved these.****NOTE: THESE ARE NOT TO BE CHECKED AS BAGGAGE!***These cannot be covering your car seat or stroller while going through security check.They may not last past a few trips, but for the cost it makes them worth it to ensure that the stroller/car seat are protected from the elements.I highly recommend them to everyone. We have told all of our friends that have kids about these!"
3,Okay for the price,"After purchasing an umbrella stroller to use in the airport, I wanted to get some sort of bag for the gate check. This bag folds nicely into an attached zipper pocket but the material is very, very thin. After flying roundtrip the bag is snagged and ripped in places--a comment on the fabric quality and baggage handling. I didn't want to spend the $50 for a Maclaren stroller bag but if I fly more than a few times with my stroller, it will be well worth the additional money. I am glad I purchased this--just protects from dirt though."
2,Cheap for a reason,"This is a very good size for any umbrella stroller and stores in its own zip pocket when not in use. However, it didn't even last one trip. We flew from NYC to London and upon arrival, this bag was ripped completely at the bottom and the toggle pull had broken off. Very disappointed! I didn't expect it to last forever based on it's cheap price but surely it should last more than one trip!! I'd recommend this if you want a protective bag for storing your stroller in your car trunk or garage but definitely not for airline travel. Spend the extra and get a heavy duty, padded one for airline travel."
2,Not worth it,Bought this because it was inexpensive. I got what I paid for. It tore on the fourth flight that we took with it (gate checked for all four flights). I recommend spending a little more for a bag made with a more durable material.
2,Consider it disposable,"Got this bag for my kid's umbrella stroller to take on trips. Good size, covers the stroller pretty well and mine is a relatively mid/large size umbrella stroller. The tie-string and handle are well made and feel durable. However, like the other reviews mentioned, the bag material is not very thick, therefore tear easily. After the first 1.5 hour plane ride, it already got a 2-3 inch tear near where the bottom wheels are. (only via gate-check, not baggage claim.) I'm duck-taping the hole for now. Still usable, but I don't expect it last for more than 3-4 more trips. If the material is little more durable, it would've been a very good bag.Also, the storage pouch is a bit too small. The bag will fit in the pouch if it's folded nicely and air-tight. If you are in a hurry and just stuff the bag into the pouch (like they showed in the video on the manufacture website), good luck zipping it up.I would buy it again if it's about $5, just use it as a few-time-use disposable bag."
1,About As Useful As A Paper Bag!,"I just bought this last week and it didn't even hold up for the first leg of our flight!! I received it at the gate and it was torn from one end to the other along the seam. It was completely unusable after that. I read the other reviews and figured it might be a gamble....glad I only paid $12 for it! Not worth your effort, try another brand."
4,Bigger than Expected,"Worked well for what we used it for. Was large enough to fit at least 2 umbrella strollers in. Also, was very visable, so it made it super easy to locate it on the checked baggage retrieval."
2,Plan to return it,"This bag got a hole in it the first time I used it, it is made with very thin material. The zipper that closes the pouch that you store it in doesn't work. I plan to return it."
3,That's ours!,"Like the other reviews, this bag did what it was supposed to do. It kept the dirt off our stroller and it was totally obvious that that was ours when it came out. Two things I didn't like about it was the size. It was like XXL or something. That made it quite awkward to hold by the attached handle. The other dislike was that the material was quite thin. Ours came back with a tear in it after the first leg of the trip.In the end, the only reason why I would recommend it is because it kept the stroller clean. I could imagine myself wiping it down with a wet wipe if I didn't have it."
2,tears easily,"This was very useful, until it ripped after the 3rd time we used it.Material is thin and susceptible to rips and tears."
3,Really worked well for one trip...now it's in the trash,"We just took a 12 day, 3 city trip that included planes, trains, and automobiles. The Gate Check Bag was really helpful in checking the stroller and keeping it clean and protected for the flight out. I think I may have used it one other time for the train or something, but when putting the stroller back in for the flight back, the bag ripped a little at the bottom. Not horrible. Made the trip the rest of the way home, but it won't survive another use. It's worth the money if you have a $100+ umbrella stroller that you want to protect. Think of it as insurance. I wouldn't waste the money though protecting an inexpensive stroller.The nylon is thin and the handle it comes with doesn't seem like it would hold up very long. Then again I was using our Graco IPO which nearly 18 lbs. The Uppababy G-Luxe would probably not tax this bag much at all since it's only 11 lbs."
2,"good idea, flimsy seams","While the bright red color makes it impossible for baggage handlers to miss seeing the bag, the actual product is flimsy. We had burst seams on the second flight."
2,Poor quality merchandise,Purchased the stroller bag for our newly purchased stroller for a vacation trip (plane) to Florida. The bag RIPPED at the seam during the trip before we even had a chance to use the stroller. I'd pass on this product. Live without the bag or find another manufacturer.
3,"Agreed, it tears pretty easily","As others have found, this just doesn't hold up for very long. It got progressively more ripped up over about 6 flights until, this last time, I actually just threw it out during our layover, as it was no longer a bag, just a shredded piece of nylon fabric. However, it was good to have and I may buy one of the slightly more expensive ones to replace it, in the hopes that it'll last longer. The bag was dirty even from just a few flights, so it saved my stroller from a lot of mess!"
3,Decent cheap protection,"Used this on a recent trip to Disney World. The bag is a good size, fit our Uppababy G-Luxe without having to remove the front wheels. Yes it is thin material and it got a few 1"" rips in it, but I figure those 1"" rips could have been in our $190 stroller rather than a $12 sack. For that reason alone it was worth the money and kept our stroller nice and clean, as the bag came back to us from the belly of the plane with a few black scuffs. We will get at least one more trips use out of it, so overall it's good/cheap protection. Another plus is that it folds into its own pocket sack nice and small so you can just throw it stroller under seat storage without taking up all the space."
3,Works great,It is a little thin so it may not last long if constant travel but it did protect my umbrella stroller from dirt during our trip
3,Gets the job done,"Used this to gate check our stroller on a trip to Mexico. Large, roomy bag that fit our Peg Perego Si (a larger umbrella stroller) with room to spare. Found 2 small-ish tears on the return trip home. I know the bag was relatively cheap ($15 Canadian compared to $40 for the Peg Perego bag), but I do think that it ought to last longer than one round trip. It does make me wonder how careless and rough the baggage handlers are, even with gate checked items, and how much worse shape my stroller would have been in without the bag."
2,Ripped before even getting on the plane!,"Other reviewers were right - this bag rips easily. We used it for our First Years umbrella stroller and when we sat it at the gate to be taken by the baggage handlers, we saw it had already ripped. Once we arrived at our destination we were able to sew it back up and it did not rip any further on the return trip. It is a nice roomy bag and we were able to stuff an extra blanket and our baby carrier in the bag as well. We'll use it on the next trip and see how it continues to hold up."
2,Great if you're gentle.,"This is a nice little bag. Nothing special, just a bag, handle, and a drawstring mouth.It lasted just one trip. On the way back, it was puntured and has a gaping hole in the side.Very overpriced for what it really is. I think I'm going to make my own with some rip-stop nylon fabric and 2 minutes on the sewing machine."
2,Functional but not made to withstand travel,"Its silly that this bag is so flimsy and not made to withstand travel, when ironically this is exactly what it is supposed to do. It worked okay overall, it protected the stroller and kept it together. However, after the very first use, when we got it back from the airline it had a huge tear on the bottom area. I don't know what they did to it but I feel like the product should stand up to wear and tear better. Isn't that what its for?"
5,Protect your stroller,"We got this to protect our stroller when checking at the gate. I'm glad we did becasue it got some gunk on it at one point, which I'm glad we didn't get on our stroller. I was able to get it off with some goo gone and soap and water, but even if I didn't- that's what this bag is for. Also- makes it easier to identify your stroller, I didn't see anyone else with one."
1,Horrible Product,We only used this bag once... it ripped on our very first use. It is not worth the money. Avoid.
3,Good Idea But Tears Easily,"This is a great idea, as these bags fold up nicely into a small, zippered pouch for storage in your carry on luggage while not on the plane. It definitely protected our stroller and baby seat (with the other gate check bag for baby seats) from getting dirty in the cargo hold. The downside is that the fabric tears very easily, and both of our bags got several tears in them after 3 or 4 flights."
3,It's okay for the price,I purchased two of these bags for a trip. I bought one for my chicco umbrella stroller and another for my pack n play. My pack n play comes with a bag as most do now but I wanted the added protection. Anway...they survived but I'm not sure how many more trips I will be able to use them for as the seams have ripped in a few areas. When I checked our bags i had the fragile tags put on them as well. They do fold up nicely in the little bag attached. Depending on how much you travel you may want to invest in something a little more durable but if it's a once a year trip you'll probably be fine.
3,Gets Job Done,"We purchased this bag to keep our stroller from getting dirty and to keep our stroller for accidentally popping open and having someone break it if that happened. We have used it on several trips but the aggravation of getting our stroller in it proved to be too much. This bag did protect our stroller from what we wanted it for and so it gets good marks there. But it will not hold up if you travel by plane a lot! And if you have a stroller that is even an inch too big you will be fighting with the bag, as it is mostly made for a compact umbrella stroller.We have a Peg Perego Pliko and while it fits, it is a nightmare to get in and out of the bag, just an FYI."
2,Horrible QUALITY!,"I purchased one of these for my MacLaren stroller so it wouldn't get dirty in the cargo hold when I gate checked it. During the flight from San Diego to Syracuse they thing was basically destroyed. A 6 inch hole had been created at the seam on the side of the bag and the fabric had started falling apart (all the threads separating). Luckily where I was going I had access to a sewing machine and I reinforced all the seams and repaired the hole (a tight fit getting the stroller back in the bag). That didn't really help though it got destroyed, same thing with the fabric fraying at the seams, on the way back and I had to throw it away. At least by buying it online I saved a few bucks. They are not made to last though so don't get too upset when it doesn't."
2,Just an Orange Bag,"It protected the stroller, but the bag itself was ripped open after one trip (with 4 flights). I reviewed the car seat bag the same way and I recommend trying to tape up the bottom or corners beforehand or somehow reinforce the bag because the luggage people will drag it and it isn't built for it."
4,Cheap and Easy,"The price and the ease of use make this an excellent companion for lightweight strollers. Being able to visibly find your stroller quickly while dealing with small children in a busy airport is more important than anything else I can think of, and the red color stands out well. While I agree with many other reviewers that the material is thin and can tear easily, it is a compromise that I'm more than willing to deal with."
5,Umbrella stroller gate check bag,Great gate check bag. Easy to get the stroller into. It opens plenty wide enough. Adds no extra weight to carry down the ramp. I would especially recommend this for anyone who uses a light-colored stroller.
4,Good Product for the Price,"We purchased this bag to gate check our Maclaren umbrella stroller. It did get beat-up a bit, and there are a few minor tears in the cover on two plane rides, but our stroller came through just fine. I feel like I could use it another couple of times before needing to replace it, and I'm glad I spent the money to buy this cover instead of just sending my stroller through unprotected. My only complaint was that it was tricky to get the cover tucked back into its pouch -- for us, it was no where near as easy as the video portrayed."
4,Does its job,"If you're simply looking for a bag that will protect your gate-checked stroller from getting dirty in the cargo area, this bag works just fine. We've had it for about a year and used it on numerous flights, and it still works fine. There are no tears, but the bag is quite dirty, which is fine since out stroller comes out clean after every flight. If, however, you're looking for a bag that will protect your stroller from getting damaged, look for something sturdier. Our stroller was damaged during a flight from Europe, but fortunately the airline reimbursed us for the damage. Overall, we're quite happy with this bag."
1,Terrible,The draw string on this bag ripped the very first time I used it. It also did not completey cover the umbrella stroller. I would not recommend this product.
2,Tears easily,"Great in theory but after two flights it is torn. Not sure why or how it could tear so easily but it did. Buy a better quality one, this will end up being more expensive because it won't last and you will have to replace it."
1,Rips easily,This is the worst stroller bag... It rips very easily made of very cheap material don't waste your time on buying this !!!!
3,Wide & Short,I bought this bag to protect my daughter's stroller when we travel to Peru. The bag is wide enough but not tall enough for her stroller. I haven't been able to use it in action yet but hopefully it holds up through our travel. Will update after travel.
1,Poor construction,"This bag only lasted a one way trip from Atlanta to Maryland. The bag ripped from the seams after one trip, this is not a sturdy bag. I was hoping to get more than one flight out of the bag, but this bag went in the trash after one use. Glad I did not pay much for the bag. If you are looking for a good stoller bag, this is not the one."
1,Good idea but VERY POOR quality,"For the quality and price I paid for, I would NOT buy this again and would just invest in something more durable. Yes it kept our umbrella stroller from getting dirty but the bag already ripped after 1 use! Using a trash bag would probably even work better or last longer."
2,Not worth spending money,"It was not easy to carry the stroller around with this bag. Also we never ended up checking the stroller in to the airplane with this bag. It was not easy to slide the stroller in, and we ended up tossing this away on the trip."
2,Two and Done,"While this product did fit our Chico stroller that is on the smaller side fairly well, after two overseas trips it was significantly ripped and damaged beyond effective use.I have other JL Childress products that work well like the car seat bag, but this one product seemed to be off the mark."
3,Ok but ripped on our first trip,It was a good cover and it protected our stroller on our trip to Las Vegas but on the way back home it the bag ripped! :-( We were only able to use it once.
1,A pain in the butt,"This bag seemed like a great idea in theory but in practice, I ended up just having to returned a damaged item. Before I even managed to put the stroller inside of the bag before getting on the plane, the bag tore on the side all the way down. So much for that and keeping my stroller safe. Not worth the time and effort sadly"
3,saves your stroller from getting torn and dirty,Just used this for a flight and was happy to see that even after being tossed around in the luggage area of the plane my stroller was not dirty or torn thanks to this bag. The bag itself however did get quite dirty and had a few small tears. It is not a very durable bag as other reviewers have said - but it did the trick. Would it stand up to use for multiple trips - probably not.
1,Ripped apart,"I give this product one star because it actually kept the stroller clean. However, after the first half of our international flight it was destroyed. It ripped right up the seam. On the way home we had to tie the bag together just so we could use it again. It is going in the trash, there is no way to repair it.I like the idea of this cover, but the material needs to be stronger."
4,Good for travel,"This bag was good for protecting stroller from coveyors and made it easy to pick mine out of a crowd at the gate. Bag got dirty, but stroller was protected from rain and usual travel dirt/grime that gets all over suitcases."
1,THIS DVD SUCKS,"THIS DVD REALLY SUCKS. I WAS EXPECTING TO SEE INTERVIEWS FROM BIGGIE HIMSELF. I WAS EXPECTING SOMETHING SIMILAR 2 ""TUPAC RESSURECTION"". BUT IT'S BASICALLY JUST INTERVIEWS WITH PEOPLE WHO KNEW BIGGIE AND NONFAMOUS DUMB ANNOYING RAPPERS TRYIN 2 FREESTYLE. THIS DVD IS A WASTE OF MONEY. BUT I DO GOTTA SAY R.I.P. NOTORIOUS B.I.G. THE GREATEST EVER!!!"
1,Shake it or leave it,"This has to be the worst flashlight I have ever seen. Shake it all you want, but it doesn't stay lit very long. I have another brand that uses no batteries. I just carry it around a little bit and it beams brightly. In my opinion, Viatek's Shake It Flashlight is not worth buying. It was a total waste of money."
4,review,"The author was one of my professors at UCLA in the early 60's, and we used this textbook. It remains a valuable resource. The book was in good condition, at a good price, and was delivered before the promised date.sk"
4,Very interesting,"This book was recommended to me and I have to admit that I really enjoyed it. It was VERY different, so be ready for a weird read."
1,Ya get watcha pay for.,"Cheap. Sharp edges. Pretty large in size. Not satisfied, but what did I really expect for such a low price?"
3,Adam Warren can,"Adam Warren is a great artist, but a writer he isn't. Got it just for the art which is spectular. Nuff said"
4,not just about Catholics,"In describing and contrasting the catholic worldview, this book also describes and defines the worldview of people raised in the Reformed Traditions (i.e. Protestants). If you want to better understand Protestants and Catholics, read this book.Protestants and Catholics alike can benefit greatly from Professor Greeley's insight. This book is a great venture into the sociology of religion."
1,embarrassing and sloppy,"an astonishingly bad book. i'm amazed a respectable university press would put something like this out. incredibly breezy, sloppy writing, many typos, little theoretical sophistication...just atrocious."
2,Not worth your time,This book is poorly written and not well thought out. It is also not relevant considering that it was written prior to the 21st century and we are now over halfway through the first decade. It definitely missed the mark...
4,Good Book,The lazy man's guide to enlightenment was indeed helpful as I move forward in my life. The simple text and easy reading made it a joy.
4,A MUST HEAR TO APRECIATE ALBUM,"David Reynoso has a deep thundering voice that gets softened for this album and all his others.His selecciones do not contain popular song overly heard with other artistsrather selected songs that range from Revolutionary Mexico, its timesand common folk, he sings to a would be fallen Major ranking friend, as well as to lost loves and betrayals, but he also worships his indigenous woman in ""Indita Mia""Imagine if you will, a man with a strong personalitywho likes to come home from work to sing his preferred music with all his daily problems left outside the door, much like ones Parent.Easy to follow along lirics even to an English speaking audience, I hope youenjoy"
5,Excellent Addition for JD Afficiniados,"Tho not always of the greatest recording quality, Is a great addition for the true JD fan. There is something new to be heard in the nuanced differences of these tracks compared to the same songs on individual albums. Only an idiot such as J Dawg below could fail to see its value."
5,Heart & Soul CD,"gave this CD to my daughter-in-law for Christmas as she requested this group. I had never heard of this group before, but they have wonderful music. She loves the CD and I love that you got it here so quickly and the price was great! Thanks!"
1,"Insanely brilliant music, but the presentation is flawed...","I have nothing new to say that has already been said about the content of this box set, so I'll cut to the point. I don't know how the original 1997 version of this set was packaged, but the 2001 edition is done very poorly. The digipak is very thin which makes it succeptible to dents and is marred very easily. If you are like me, shelling out (dollar amount) for poor packaging is difficult, no matter how great the music is. I actually had to exchange my set twice because the plastic disc holders were broken and had scratched up the discs. My third copy was fine disc holder-wise, but the box looks like it has been thrown around a bit."
4,a good example of a box set.,"if you like Joy Division..buy this, relentless of you having all of their albums, and everything, this truly completed my collection..and was worth the buy. especially the great book that comes with it."
5,Historic,"simply put, this is everything Joy Division ever recorded and much, much more. Includes eerie basement demos of songs sung by Ian Curtis that would eventually become New Order songs. Ever wanted to hear ""Ceremony"" the way it was initially intended to be sung? Well, now's your chance. If you are a Joy Division fan, this is all you'll ever need to own. The packaging is BEAUTIFULL, and the inside booklet is very very good. Chock full of gorgeous photos and well written information. I am very impressed by this box set. Kudos to London Records. I recommend this one to anyone and everyone. It's well worth the price."
5,The Joy In Our Division,"I'm going to keep this short and simple:""Heart and Soul"" is essential. i don't care how expensive it is. It is worth every penny. Joy Division isn't only one of the most influential bands of all time(hello Interpol), but they are also one of the best. I don't care if you're a goth, a punk, an emo kid, whatever group you choose yo assoiciate yourself with. Joy Division is better than almost any band ever, and ""Heart and Soul"" displays that perfectly, from the rawer, more aggresive Warsaw era stuff to the more polished ""Love Will Tear Us Apart"". This is simply brilliant.I give five stars very reluctantly to anything, but this collection deserves it. Even their outtakes are essential.Thank you."
4,Grail of Gloom,"This is it, this is the most complete Joy Division collection you could ask for. The obsessive collector likely has already assembled all these tracks from various discs, and there really is nothing new for the angst-ridden afficianado, but two things make it worth the price of admission: the convenience of the oeuvre on 4 discs; and the booklet."
5,Wonderful best bang for the buck!!,I first heard of Joy Division when I saw love will tear us apart on a video compilation I considered myself a casual fan I thought about buying JD back catalogue one by one but when I saw this I thought WOW!! I can buy it all right here (sans a few missing songs and maybe live shows) This is the ultimate tribute to Ian Curtis nobody's music collection should be without it. The music is dark when you compare it with New order but Joy division are/were better in every aspect. This box set is worth shelling the dosh out for.
1,Don't do it!!,I tried to order this item and got sent a different item that I didn't even know what it was. They said there was an error on the website and they actually didn't have the template. Don't waste your time. Buy it somewhere else.
2,Not Thrilled,"Although I knew the limitations of this product, I couldn't enlarge it enough to see the numbers. I was going to use this when making dresden plates to round off the top of the piece. But I won't be able to do so. The pitch of the curve isn't enough for small pieces."
5,Great tool!,Ordered on 1/15/12 and got exactly what was described and pictured. This gem makes scallops a cinch! Here is a video tutorial I highly recommend you watch to get started. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIHhTxTpMQ0
5,Excellent,"Well worth buying, this book does an excellent job of explaining why it's important that your Website is easy to use, and how you can design it to make it so. If you are planning to do business on the Web, this book is essential reading. The author has clearly thought through the issues and come up with a design approach which adresses them."
4,Easy reading,"This book was excellent. Not only for the abandoned, but for every woman! This book was very easy to read and very comforting. I loved it and would suggest everyone read it and pass it on. Carolyn is a simply beautiful woman. I think if the all women read this, especially young women it will save a lot of heartaches from ending dangerous, life-threatening. Teach a lesson before it needs to be taught! Give it to a young soul beginning a relationship - Thank you!"
4,Excellent Value,"Not the best printer on the planet, but definitely a good value. I don't need a color laser or a photo printer, so it works for me.Print quality is good for schematics, drafting, and other vector based images. Much better than a more expensive Cannon that I am replacing. I haven't tried it on any raster images, and probably never will. I also have no idea what kind of photo printing capabilities it has, because I just don't care.Setup is very easy, it took me a total of a half hour to unpack the printer, assemble it, run cords, install the drivers on the host PC (which has the same speed processor as the printer), and install the drivers on another PC, and have the whole thing networked. Everything worked fine right out of the box on the first try."
1,Stay away from this printer!!!,"I needed a large format printer for my small business, so I got online and reviewed seveal hp printers, and I ""chatted"" with one of their online reps. I was told this was the best printer for my needs. Little did I know that in order to use it I would have to redo my entire network setup. Well, after a full day of trying everything they told me to do, I am MORE than happy to PAY TO SHIP IT BACK!!!DON'T BUY THIS PIECE OF CRAP PRINTER!!"
4,Love Poodles? Love this Book!,This is a nice book for young adults! I can almost see my own dogs acting out the parts! Anyone who has a pet will like this book--young or old!
1,A real dog of a journey!,"What a waste of valuable reading time. There were so many symbols and characters, I was unable to determine what was being said. I would be ashamed to be known as any poodle written about in this book!"
5,Book 'em Danno!,"Possibly the finest season in the show's twelve year run, at last, season five is here in all it remastered glory! Quality of the actual DVDs themselves is, in the main, very good - superb in some episodes; if you take into consideration the print quality of other shows from this era - colours are generally vibrant and rich. The soundtrack is intact and as broadcast - so any fears over tinkering similar to that of ""The Fugitive"" can be laid to rest. Subsequent seasons never bettered this one, but some tried and season 6 came close. Seasons 7 & 8 weren't too bad either and of course, ""Nine Dragons"" - the opening episode to season 9 is rightly regarded as classic. Highly recommended - roll on the next release and let us relive one of the very best 5-0 episodes - ""Hookman""."
4,5th season,"the dvd,s where ok but they always break off when taking them out of the case. Quality wise the dvd where ok. The season itself was great and enjoyed the season. Its the first season with out Kono but still was great. More emphasize on forensic science before there ever was a interest."
5,Season 5 is the creative peak for the series,"Season 5 marks the creative peak for this classic series. ""V for Vashon"" and ""Engaged to Die"" with a young Erik Estrada make this season worth buying. The characters have matured in their roles and the story lines have become more intense. By comparing this season with its predessors, the creative quality is significant. That said, season six is probably the swan song of the entire series with my personal favorite episode ""Hook Man"". Be There...Aloha."
3,over the hill gang,the appeal of this standard western is the actors. it was nice to see these old-timers at work.
2,Great cast. Not bad for a western,"I'm not a real big western fan. Actually this is the only one I have in my collection. I knew my mother would get a charge out of it, so I ordered it for her as well. I liked the cast of Jack Elam, Edgar Buchanan, Walter Brennan, Rick Nelson, and Chill Wills. Of course I couldn't forget about Andy Devine. I felt the first movie was the best of the two. Over The Hill Gang Rides Again was rather boring. If you like westerns, you'll like this especially for the cast. I don't think the movie would mean as much, or be as entertaining if they weren't in it. What happened to all those great Jack Elam movies?"
5,Great Family Western Comedy!!,"In this film a group of retired Texas Rangers(Walter Brennan,Edgar Buchanan,Pat O'Brien and Chill Wills)take on a corrupt small Nevada town relying on their brains not brawn.Also co-starring Ricky Nelson,Kris Nelson,Edward Andrews and Jack Elam.It's a great family western comedy!!"
2,Not really funny and not really good family entertainment,"There is a little wry humor in the movie for those who think growing old is funny (I don't). The main objection I have to this film and the reason I say it isn't good family entertainment is the drinking element. Drunkenness is not funny and I don't believe a normal social life in the old West revolved around saloons. Sadly, many westerns portray that generation as universally accepting drinking (including this one). The cowboys always go to the saloon and order beer or whiskey. You have to be careful what you teach your kids is funny. If they see you laughing at drunken antics on the screen, they will act out; that's never funny. That's my two cents worth from a Christian perspective. Just remember that if your kids get in trouble and alcohol is involved you may find yourself asking the question ""Is drunkenness really funny?"" The only redeeming quality for this film is that the aging rangers persevere and use their wits (sort of)."
3,Western for the family,"I enjoyed this number. a good one for the kids and looking backnow its a good one for us older folks as well!! they sure do not makethem like this one anymore, its almost disney""esque""."
3,Great Western With Lots of Old Stars,"To be totally honest, I bought this because I rented it from the library and I lost it. In a hurry to avoid a huge fine, I snatched it a the low price of around $6. It's a great show with many old TV stars that you (if you're a western fan) will recognize. Walter Brennan, Jack Elam and Edgar Buchanan are only a few of the famous actors featured."
4,Wisdom Comes With Age,"This was a good movie. The first version shows a bit dark, but very funny; the second version is very clear."
5,Ya Gotta Believe,"I just have to say that this book is absolutley amazing! It will make you laugh, cry and just feel like you were right by Tug's side during his life.People who knew him, LOVED HIM and looked up to him. This book will make you understand why his signature in life is: YA GOTTA BELIEVE."
3,Interesting,"Very Emotional. I just couldn't believe how much he denied his oldest son. After all that emotional toll he put on his oldest son, he was the one there in the end for Tug. What an interesting turn of events. It does teach you to have a positive outlook on any type of disease they is thrown your way."
5,Well made plush animal,This plush toy exceeded my expectations. Very durable and very soft. My niece gushed over it. It makes a quality present!
3,Good start but thats about it,"I couldn't find any other book in a quick fix for study material.I need to pass the PRAXIS for graduate school and have just taken the test----I have not taken math for over 13 years, and it did help me----to an extent. I would recommend for those of you who are not fresh out of college or high school to look elsewhere for help. This book doesn't help kick start your math, its just a REFRESHER. The reading and writing were a help, but I really feel that I could've done better on the PRAXIS math if I would've had more detailed math help in the book. I needed clear explanations on how problems were solved. These weren't present.The rest of it was fine---the reading question and answers were a bit biased; but on the whole a great help for those who need a quick reference guide but have no real problem areas.The PRAXIS math is not a hard test, but it is for someone who is a bit out of practice! Study hard! (In another book!)"
4,Very Helpful Book,"I used the book for the PLT section of the test and it proved to be very usefull. Unfortunately, it did not cover the music section of the test which was required for my certification (0113). If you are looking for one of the other sections it did cover those.The book, in general, is very thorough and even has a small section on how to find a job and for writing a resumee."
3,What Was Missing,"I just took the Praxis test and although this book was helpful, it put emphasis on trivial parts of the test and wasn't thorough enough on others. For example, the book was not specific to any test. It was difficult to figure out what you needed to study for the 0014 test. I studied dance, music and art which wasn't on the test. The social studies section on the test was extremely specific. The book suggested that if you just ""looked over"" that section, you would be in good shape. The math in the book is thorough and tedious but the test questions were a piece of cake in comparison. In short, the book was helpful but definitely needs to be be more specific about what is required for each test and concentrate on each of the four core areas."
1,If only no stars was an option...,This book was worthless and gave me ZERO help for the middle grades praxis tests. It focuses on elementary education tests and the PPST. If you are preparing for the middle grades PRAXIS II PLT 5-9 try The Best Teachers' Test Preparation for the Praxis Plt Test Grades 5-9: Principles of Learning and Teaching Test instead.
4,Good product - costly shipping,"The LifeHammer is a good product, a bit small but I have seen tests on Mythbusters (Discovery Channel) and it seems to work just fine. I purchased two different type hammers in the same transaction and was charged two different shipping fees from two different vendors which seems innefficient to me. If I could find this product in a brick and mortar store, I would have purchased it there."
5,Great,Everyone should have one of these in their car. It is exactly as it is described. Very good quality.
5,Thankfully I haven't had a chance to use it yet...,But this thing seems like it will do the trick and I feel so much safer having it in my car.
1,"""Strap Cutter"" is a joke.","I bought this for my car emergency kit. I tested the glass breaker, it works great! The strap cutter is a joke. The angle of the blade is ridiculous. I tried cutting many different materials with the blade, it cut through nothing! The LifeHammer is good for glass breaking, that's it! Buy a separate strap cutter. Very disappointed."
4,Shatters glass great but wont cut too many seatbelts.,"I recently took a vehicle extrication class. The window punch that was on the extrication truck would not work. I remembered having this. It broke countless windows with just one hit to the corner. (you always want to hit the corner of the windows)The plastic handle did get a little cut up but will still go through more windows. The seatbelt cutter only made It through 1 seatbelt, and now it has alot of seatbelt fibers on the blade.I would advise when mounting this in your vehicle that you mount it by your middle dome light, in case the driver is knocked out, someone else can still get it. (-:"
5,Life saving hammer,"I ordered this life saving hammer through Amazon.com and recommend every car and truck have one.The hammer should come with every vehicle made. The hammer is heavy-duty, brightly colored, andcould be used in many instances. It is a life-saver. What better recommendation?P.S. As a woman, I feel safer having this hammer in my vehicle (not in the trunk)."
3,"So small, so light in weight","I expected something a bit heavier. Maybe it could break automotive glass, but it doesn't seem heavy enough to do the job. The handle doesn't have the length to give extra wallop to the swing of the hammer either. Unfortunately, I can hardly test it...unless someone will donate a car window to me. Hopefully, I'll never have to use it for real.On the other hand, delivery time was phenomenal. I didn't pay extra for express delivery. Regardless, I had the product within three days. And, the seatbelt cutter recessed in the structure is much safer than scissors flying everywhere out of the door storage if you should find yourself in a roll-over and the belt won't release."
4,Great Safety Item,"My wife wanted something like this to feel safer in the car. Not only does it break the glass, it also has a seatbelt cutter."
2,Under water?,Anyone ever swung a hammer under water?For first responders this probably works well but I'd get something like an auto punch for self rescue.
5,A must...,Have one on my car and one on my plane. This little gadget is a must for safety and rescue minded drivers/pilots.
2,Needs a better blade.,"The problem with reviewing safety equipment is you might never get a chance to actually use it in the situation that its purchased for.That said, a number of reviewers have mentioned that the blade on this might only be sharp enough to get through one seat-belt (even then, not easily).Completely unacceptable. This company also manufactures the ResQme, another product plagued by quality problems.I've ordered a similar product manufactured by EMI from another website. Its priced about the same and its intended audience is rescue personnel.Don't skimp on your life."
4,Looks Cool!,"I don't drive near lakes, nor worry about having an accident where I would need to break a window. I bought it because it looked slick; though mostly as a conversation piece when I have 'those kind of' passengers . ;-)When I received the product, I mounted it promptly in my car. For mounting I affixed Velcro (the pointy / hard side) to the back of the base, this allowed me to mount the hammer anywhere there is carpet. Currently it's mounted behind the center console, so all 4 passengers (and driver) can reach it."
5,LifeSaver hammer it could be...,"Received within 3 days. Saw Mythbusters do a test of these LifeHammers and they worked quite well cutting through the seatbealt and any of the windows EXCEPT the WINDSHIELD. Commit that to memory! In a emergency situation it will not easily crack or break the windshield, side and rear glass only. Mine is getting mounted in clear sight and access from the front seat, right in the middle of the rear seat benches so as to be easily grabbed by all! I have had experience with a stuck seat belt and they are a bitch to cut through with a semi-sharp pockt knife."
4,"like the hammer, hate the installation","The hammer is a great product, but the installation is bogus. First, the recommended velcro doesn't work because there isn't enough surface area on the back for any velcro to attach, and, in fact, parts of the back are concave which makes the velcro impossible. There are, however, holes for a screw installation. I was able to remove my center console and attach it with three screws, without any damage to any electrical system in the car. Now that it's attached, I'm happy, but the directions were a little lame with regard to installation. Otherwise, 4 stars!"
4,LifeHammer Original Emergency Hammer,"Hard to remove from plastic holder in order to put in glove box; however, it looks like it could prove to be a lifesaver if needed."
2,LifeSaver???,Let me start by saying that I've never been upside down in a submerged car trying to cut my seatbelt off and shatter the window to get out but if I was there are better safety hammers/tools on the market. This one is lightweight and reminds me of a toy. I'm afraid it would break before the window would. It does have a sharp point and cutting edge both untried by me. It just doesn't instill confidence. Look elsewhere and spend a little more for the real thing.
1,NOT Useful in an Accident,"I have to question the usefulness of this device during a real accident. If your car crashes, there will be tons of things flying about in your car, including this tool. The chance of you finding this tool is next to nothing. The same situation applies if your car crashes into the water. The tool will probably be dislodge so you can't find it either.The best tool to save your life is to be prepared. If you go into the water, keep to window down so you can open the door to get out. You can extricate yourself if you are buckled in. Even in the very rare event the buckle doesn't disengage, you can still leave by sliding out of the seatbelt. It is not like a 5 point racing harness. Be prepare, practice for the emergency. If you rely on this tool, it is worthless in an accident since you will never find it.The only purpose of having this tool is when you arrive at an accident and need to remove the car crash victims away from their vehicle. It is NOT designed for you."
1,The perfect item for criminals to enter a locked vehicle!!!,"Let's think about the odds of being stuck in a submerged car in a lake.Now, lets think about that statistics of vehicles being broken into to steal GPS's, Stereo's, etc....Looks like there is a reason why these are selling so well -"
1,is this a prank?,I had a hard time breaking tempered glass with a 20 oz hammer on a 16 inch handle. This toy wouldn't leave a scratch. The belt cutter looks at least as bad. Any one who would buy it is a fool and anyone who claims it can save a life should be in jail.
4,Hammer - small,Not a big hammer but about right for storing in the car. Hope it will do the job if needed.
3,It's OKAY,"Frankly I was disappointed based on all the outstanding reviews. In reality it is pretty cheaply constructed and the blade is pretty small and I would imagine pretty hard to use in a real emergency. I think the CONCEPT IS GREAT, don't get me wrong but for $15 this could have been better constructed... I honestly worry about it holding up in a real emergency."
2,Poor print quality,"I ordered this book after looking through a coworker's copy. In the book I received from Amazon, the images appeared to be poor-quality photocopies of those appearing in my coworker's book. I think that in most cases the print quality will be okay enough to make out the diagram, but probably not in all of them. Pretty disappointing."
1,As a Student,"I recently took a class on Vibrations and Waves and the professor ended up using this book mainly for the course. It was somewhat difficult to read through and the material in the book often has little to do with the actual practice problems. Also, there are no examples and many of the chapters refuse to go into important detail of some topics, assuming the reader to know a good deal."
5,If only every textbook was this good...,"I used this book instead of the originally assigned text (H.J. Pain's truly awful ""Physics of Vibrations and Waves"") in a class I took recently. It was a pleasure to read.In spite of the fact that the book is quite short (and quite compact in your bag), it covers the material very thoroughly. The author writes clearly and with a lot of attention to the needs of the student. French's style is also very lively and makes you want to read on instead of feeling you are obligated to. The problems at the end of each chapter are excellent. It is also inexpensive.All in all, quite a gem in this day of boring, incomprehensible, too-heavy-to-carry $120 textbooks that arrive in a ""new"" less readable edition every year. If only every textbook could be like this.It isn't quite perfect -- every once in a while a derivation gets obscure and a few topics aren't covered -- but it is very, very good. I highly recommend it."
1,Kindle format not adequate,"I have only just begun to read through this book but I have already encountered several equation rendering issues. The symbol for ""Psi naught"" appears as a 0 IN FRONT of a psi character. One equation did not have an equals sign in it making it very difficult to understand. I had to go on google books a few times for clarification. Don't buy this book! Download it as a pdf if it is offered in that format or just buy the paper copy."
5,Amazing!,"I mixed 1 scoop with the L'Oreal 40 creme developer until it was the consistancy of a thick gravy- like texture, or like a thicker pancake texture.I put applied it and it really lifted some major color in about twenty minutes. I think this stuff did something to my hair, which made the color I applied look even brighter than normal.I've been dying my hair a crayon red color and, with the manic panic, my hair always came out really brassy. I'd put the color on and it would come out a dark reddish brown color.This L'oreal developer with the blue bleach didn't lift that much more color than the manic panic, but it, somehow, took out the brassy tones which left the red hair dye to really shine bright.Anyway, really good stuff and I will be buying it again. After using this bleach, my hair was not crunchy and crappy dry, but it was soft and fluffly like. Really good stuff!"
4,Loreal Quick Blue,"Mixes well and does not clog if the correct developer is selected. Does a really fine job on eliminating brassy tones. Recommend using a deep recovery mask such as Neutrogena or L'Oreal. Also, best if used on shorter hair. Bleach will tend to fry out longer hair."
5,Love this product,I really like this product. My hair all comes out one color in just a little time. It is easy to use. It is great I can just buy it on Amazon.
2,Big container.,I dont quite understand why you get such a big container and then 2 little bags of bleach inside that fills maybe 1/3 of the container. I have the bleach on my hair right now. at first it was burning kinda on the back of my head. but now its just kinda warm. the mixture is different from other bleaches i've used. this mixture is thicker but still works. when i look in the mirror i can see blond. and it's only been on for a few minutes. now i'm going to wait 40 minutes. DEAR GOD it turned out horrible. my roots are super blond but then it turns brassy and i have some dark sploches which i know i covered. it doesnt look blond at all. just orange brass.
2,Didn't help,"I bought this in hopes of adapting my laserwriter to my new Mac Pro, but while that worked for some people with same printer and Mac model, I just couldn't get it to work for me.I'm sure the cable would work for someone, but in my case, it was money down the toilet..."
1,It's 36 pin not 25 and package was opened,"I need a 25 pin and this is 36. There is no mention of this in the description. The package had already been opened. Seller had placed a piece of cellophane tape to close it. It's obviously been around the block a time or two. Useless for me. It won't work for an HP 722c.Purchased through Amazon from EZYLY Corporation in Garden Grove, CA. Vendor should have listed the pin or IEEE or something. I got a good price so not out too much. Lesson learned."
1,Darn thing is for 98/ME! be warned!,"I had my Xerox printer driver set up for XP, then put the CD in that came with this converter, and was greatly disappointed that it's for Windows 98/ME! This is very ancient and outdated and won't work on most systems."
1,Not for HP LJ6MP either,"Good concept, but unfortunately, wouldn't print. Win 7 saw the printer but print jobs would not initiate. I installed exactly as instructed, even used the enclosed mini disk the second time."
2,not the right cable product for the HP printer I searched and indicated,"I searched for cable for HP 2100 LaserJet specifically. This is the wrong cable for this printer, and thus unusable and incorrect. Frustrating because return price would be almost cost of cable."
1,Dynex USB Parallel Converter Not Compatible with HP 6P,Unfortunately the Dynex USB - Partallel converter was actually NOT COMPATIBLE with the HP Laserjet 6P printer.One of the reviews had said it was compatible - WRONG.Ended up in the trash
2,VERY misleading title - really for beginners,"Given the ""Best Practices"" title, I assumed that this book was going to go into much more advanced lessons about real world problems and solutions for ADO.NETInstead, I found a book filled with beginners guides to the database wizards included in Visual Studio.NET and ""first you do this, then you do that"" types of examples.The author barely touches on designing N-tier architectures and instead spends most of the time comparing ADO.NET and ADO.A decent book if you are experienced at ADO and are just now learning ADO.NET. Otherwise, stay away."
2,It didnt show what I expected,The title indicates that the book will give you a practical view of the use of ADO.NET with examples. But two thirds of the book deals with ADOc. I needed practical information on how to use ADO.NET. This is not thruth on this book. If possible I would like to return it to the seller.
2,stop the confusion,Amazon--you are using the same excerpts & tables of contents for all the FRAGMENT-ZONE books. It's very confusing/difficult to figure out which essays belong to which book.Please match the cover with the correct insides.
2,Just can't get the thing to lay flat,"Product comes coiled and Never seems to uncoil. The double stick tape helps, but product is 6 ft and only 3 ft tape provided."
2,Might as well use duct tape.,"I've had the thing several weeks now, and still can't get it to lie flat. Sure, you can't see the cord...but what good is that if you keep tripping over the concealer?"
3,Performs as expected,"This is exactly what I was expecting and is functioning well at keeping us from tripping over and having to look at a nasty cable cord. It's high enough that it just barely bumps up against the bottom of the room door, but in a way that is working for us and preventing the door closing all the way unless we want it to. It does not prevent the door being closed, it simply provides a little friction. The only challenge was getting it to flatten out, which makes sense--it is plastic rolled into a coil (as seen in the picture), just start straightening it out over a day and it'll be fine. Don't expect the double-sided tape to hold it down if you don't give it time to straighten out."
2,Missing double-sided adhesive tape,"Packaging was intact. When I opened the package, the box containing the cord concealer was ALREADY OPENED!!! The double-sided tape was NO WHERE TO BE FOUND!!! Seriously??? I can even see the folds on the lids. It seems like someone was trying to take the tape out and closed the lid in a hurry and messed it up. Disappointed!"
3,Conceals cords,"First off the grey is not as dark as pictured, so keep that in mind if color is important. Like others have stated, you need to heat these things up and make them pliable before they'll lay flat. My technique was to sit in front of a heater and hold the pieces I'd cut as close as I could until the rubber became soft enough to no longer hold it's own shape vs. gravity. I then laid it out flat in my shower and held it in the shape it was supposed to be in. I then turned on the shower (on cold of course) and the rubber instantly hardened up and remained flat. I had to retry on one that I didn't get hot enough, but it was easy to redo. Then let them dry, and you'll be good to go. I used it for speaker wires and it held my three speaker wires pretty well, but don't expect it to hold more than 2-3 power cords if they're on the thick side."
4,boiling trick works,boiling the thing really does work to make it straight. the material feel rugged and gets the job done. easy to cut and easy to install cord
4,Not bad for the price,Pretty good for the price.. the strip is not that wide so it takes some work to get the curl out of it and lie flat.. guess that is what the two sided tape ( GOOD IDEA) incurred with it is for.But is came fast and does the job. It was pretty easy to cut to size even with a pair of smallish pissoirs.
2,Looks good in the pictures. . .,"In the pictures, this cord runner looks like any other. But in reality, it is so thin and flimsy that it rises further off of the floor than any of the cables did, making it even MORE of a hazard. Since this item came rolled up in a box, I straightened it out and put heavy objects on it for over 24 hours. It still tries to roll back up, creating the previously mentioned hazard. Spend a little more money and get a (much) thicker cable-runner."
1,"Curls, plastic not very sturdy, now relegated to a cupboard","I usually like Belkin products, but I was very disappointed with this one. I was hoping it would neatly hide 3 cables over 1 yard of open space. It did, but it didn't look pretty.I tried the hot water trick to straighten out the plastic and stop it from curling at both ends. It helped a little bit, but the ends were still raised off the ground with the cables in. The double-sided tape (supplied) worked for about a day.All in all, very unhappy with the cable protector. I found a sturdier version made by ChordSavers, which is rigid and comes in a greater choice of colours including wood effects, although admittedly more expensive. In this case, you get what you pay for!Sorry Belkin, not this time."
2,Cord Concealer,"Mine was 6' long, but only about 4 feet are useful. The inner 1.5 feet are wound so tightly they are permanently distorted. About 0.5 feet of the outer end are distorted.Mine arrived without the tape, but the problem was quickly corrected when I reported it. Instructions said to drop the return package into any UPS drop box, but if you use the original package, it is too big for a drop box. You have to find a service center.A decent deal if you are going to need only 4 feet."
3,Good overall!,"Concealer is made of tough material. It was okay to unroll, but the ends were a bit stubborn. I put the ends under a heavy dresser for a few days and it is better now. The inner end is not as pretty though...it looks like there is a bit of damage from being rolled into such a small coil that the underside is a bit ""ugly"". But it will still work (I think). I have not tried to use it yet. I am keeping it, however, since I bought 4 and don't want the hassle of returning them. I did not see directions but I am assuming that I will need to tape it down with duct tape since the double-sided tape it comes with doesnt' seem sturdy/strong enough to hold it.Update-- This item has settled and does not recoil back into it's original shape anymore. It works well. I would recommend. Very sturdy!"
4,Great if you dip it in hot water first,"This product comes tightly coiled but softens and straightens almost instantly if you dip it in a sink or pan of hot (pre- or post-boiling) water. It's easy to stick multiple cords inside (I have three inside), and comes with double-sided adhesive to seal it to the floor (if you want). I give it four stars instead of five because it would be better if it had the optional peel off adhesive already attached to it -- like the IKEA wall cord covers."
5,Does the job,The cable protector is reasonably priced and does what it is suppoed to do. I really can't ask for more.
3,Functional,"Functional, but the curl left over from packaging takes awhile to get rid of. Heavy books at each end are doing the job so far."
4,Stiff but protective and what is in the picture!,"This Belkin Cord Concealer comes in a tight roll inside a box smaller than 1 square foot. It is although what I was expecting! The color is a little lighter but no picture could be perfect. This product also comes with a roll of white double sided tape to attach it to the floor. It attached to my deep carpet very well. In order to unstiffen it I had to do what another user did by soaking it in hot water for about 6 minutes. This loosened it well, then I put heavy objects on it! I would recommend this product to anyone who has about 2 or 3 wires running on their floor. I would also advise you what this fits in it. One extension cord (such asC2G / Cables to Go 03117 18 AWG 15 feet/4.26 Meter Outlet Saver Power Extension Cord NEMA 515R to NEMA 515P Black) along with an ethernet cable and possibly another small cable...I used an HDMI. Please know you CANNOT just open this and slap it down, it will require unstiffening and cable fitting and taping."
2,Ok product,"This cord concealer is only mediocre it would not flatten out and one end was gnarled up and required duct tape to hold it down. However, it is well constructed and does the job for high traffic areas."
5,Works great!,Just what we needed. It works great! Perfect for at the museum concealing cords. Visitors never trip on them. Great.
3,Could be better,This works OK to conceal a single power cord. I wanted to hide 3 speaker cables and a phone cord and found that it had barely enough room in the channel to fit those 4 relatively thin cables.It arrives in a coil as shown and takes a couple of days to relax and flatten.
4,good for small or single cords,"The channel on this cord protector is about 1/2"" x 1/2"", even though the box advertises it as being capable of holding cords that are up to 3/4"" in diameter. The 3/4"" limit only applies if the cord concealer bulges up and is not flat on the floor. I'm using three heavy-duty extension cords, and this product does not have a large enough channel to fit all of them. It's great for just one extension cord or perhaps a couple of internet cords. Also, to flatten out the cord concealer, I recommend the same advice as other reviewers: soak it in hot water (such as a bathtub) for about 10-20 minutes, and it'll flatten out very easily."
2,Disappointing,"I followed the instructions on the other reviews on reverse rolling the cord concealer and waiting a few days. However, even after a couple of weeks, the cord concealer is still not lying flat at all. It is straight but the sides never actually touch the ground. If I had to do it again, I would try something else."
2,more pain than it's worth,"It doesn't hold many cords, and getting it to straighten out was a pain. It really wasn't worth the hassle or effort. Knowing what I know now, I would have just taped the cables to the floor and called it a day."
4,No more tripping.,"This does the job well. Like other reviewers wrote, I soaked it in hot water to flatten it out, then put books on it. Did not re -curl. Just wish it came in less ugly colors :)"
1,Annoying!,"It came wrapped around itself, as the picture shows. Nothing I did would flatten it out. I laid in in the sun, I put heavy items the entire length. It still would try to roll up and the 2-sided tape wasn't strong enough to hold it down to the carpet. I should have sent it back, but I just gave it away to my dad who is gonna try it on his concrete garage floor. Booo! :("
1,Not recommended,"The product was meant to be new, the product arrived and it looks like a used item that was pulled out form an existing installation. It serves it purpose- It would be cheaper to buy 12FT than this."
1,Insults my intelligence,"I just couldn't buy the whole premise of this book. Why would Thea and her husband keep the child when, with all their millions they could simply adopt? It just didn't make sense. I also found the characters undeveloped and flat, the dialog trite. I could feel no sympathy or emotion for any of the characters. I could care less what happens to them since most of them had no redeeming qualities. Hannah/Jessie was not very intelligent and seemed to make decisions willy nilly. Overall, this was a dissappointing read. Don't even bother with this one."
2,"Unable to put down.,but dissappointing ending!","I liked the book, could not put it down. HOWEVER, I thought the writer made some personality changes on her characters. First, the main character's first love was great in the beginning, I loved the teasing banter between them. Then, all of a sudden the author changed her tone on their communication. Very dissappointed in the ending,not having her love follow her to Africa. I thought she really liked the guy at the end and then he just drops off. Oh well, I will continue to read."
1,Ugh,"I borrowed this book from the library and I wish I could tell the staff to remove it from the shelves, this book is so bad. I got about half way through and realized that I could barely recall the plot, let alone the qualities of the characters, and this was a red flag to quit wasting my time. Nobody has a personality. Even when they had outbursts, they were wooden and monotone. The dialogue is cringeworthy, stilted and contrived. She attempts to use the character's awkward monologues as exposition and it's just painful to read. If one of the characters said, ""that's another way of saying...."" One more time...ugh! And what 18 year old barely out of high school lands a job with a high profile politician, managing his office staff?? The dog's death scene was awful. Not believable. Pointless tangents abound--""Bibbity Bop"". For crying out loud? Do NOT try this book unless you are trying to make time stand still. It is that boring."
1,Toooooo long,"This story could have been covered (probably better) in half the number of ""pages"". Boring, DISJOINTED soap opera.My second Fern Michaels read and the last."
2,not what i would have expected,I am normally an avid fan of fern michaels work but this book was a disappointment!! i felt like there was not enough insight into jessie roland's life as a child when being raised by her kidnapper parents and that also it tended to ramble on at times! There are some parts of the book that i enjoyed but this will not be a book i would choose to read again!
2,"Good plot, but disappointing conclusion.","After waiting a year to find this book in paperback version, I could hardly wait to get started on it - stayed up Friday 'til Sat morning to read it. The plot was excellent, but handling of the story was not up to Michael's usual expertise. After the extended crescendo of the plot, the conclusion was handled inconsequentially. Indication was that much time had been spent on the plot but that the ending was not well thought out and perhaps rushed to meet a deadline. Could have been much better. Very disappointing."
5,Tragedy with a happy ending!,"""Finders Keepers"" was the first real novel I have ever read. I really enjoyed this book and it kept me interested. Fern Michaels has a really unique since of writing, one of which I like. I'm looking forward to reading ""Sara's Song""."
4,Awesome Book!,"I enjoyed this book so much.. it was my second Fern Michaels book, my first being the guest list. I really loved Finder's Keepers and I am on a mission to read every single one of her books. She is great! I hope there will be a conclusion to Finder's Keepers so we know what happened to Jessie later in life!"
2,Awful,"For some reason, I couldn't quit reading this book but I think it was because of it's potential. The characters and the plot are a good idea, but never reach their potential. The dialoug is AWFUL and I could never get lost in the story because of it. There are too many tangents and not enough substance and you're left with no closure at the end. And there is no love story, no romance. My first fern michaels and probably my last."
1,Totally agree with Carol A. Strickland's review,Carol A. Strickland's review rang true for me after finishing Fern Michaels' Finders Keepers. Read her review and choose another book to read. It will save you a lot of time!
2,The conversations between the characters were trite.,I have read several of Ms. Michaels books; although not over the past couple of years. This book was disappointing and somewhat unbeliveable. The main character's friend was the 3rd richest person in the world ; her husband left her alone even after finding out she was pregnant; her adopted parents got away from prosecution; she found her real parents; she leaves everyone behind to build a bridge. Sure!
3,Boring in the middle.,I found the dialogue very boring. The beginning and the end were good with a lull in the middle. Not the typical Fern Michaels book.
3,Finders Keepers,The book started out interesting but drifted from the plot. To many diversions before she is on track to find the parents.
4,"Great cookwear, but not perfect","I received the 2 1/2 quart saucepan for Christmas. Cooks GREAT and cleanup is VERY easy. A couple of minor annoyances: 1) I wish it came with a glass lid like the Calphalone One nonstick version, and 2) the metal is definitely ""softer"" than my old faberware stainless steel set. If you bang a spoon against the lip of the pan while cooking(say, to dislodge some rice), it leaves little dings around the edge. There's still an adequate seal with the lid, but I at this price I expect my cookware to be bulletproof. Never had this happen on my cheapo Faberware set."
3,5 READER FROM MEMPHIS CITY SCHOOL,Nicole-I think the book was boring and depressing.It was a litttle too over the edge.Tears of a Tiger was just DULL!!!!!!Ericka-I think the book was very interesting and sad.Tears of a Tiger the best book I had ever read.
3,Tears of a Tiger,"I read Tears of a Tiger, by Sharon M. Draper and I thought that it was a very well written, dramatic book. It was a bit sad and depressing. The style of writing was very unique and I think that a lot of teenagers nowadays can relate to the characters situations; and a lot of teenagers may have even found themselves in the main character, Andy's situation. This book also shows the dramatic consequence of driving under the influence and how this can affect someone and their family members and friends. I rated this book on a scale of one to five, five being the highest and I give Tears of a Tiger a three point five."
4,Freshman HS required summer reading,"At the strong recommendation of my daughter's high school, I purchased this text. She was not initially thrilled by the beginning, however, the book picked up and she is very absorbed in it's message."
4,Young people need to read this book!,I loved the set-up of this book. It was a really fast read and has great chapters. This book is a great teaching tool. It is a reality based - not some candy covered stroy about drinking and driving. Young people need to know that this could happen to them!
3,A very POWERFUL book!,"Tears of a Tiger is about a seventeen year old boy who was in a drinking and driving accident and one of his very close friends was killed. This book tells about how Andy trys to get through it, but things seem to just get worse for him.Tears of a Tiger ia a very realistic book. It tells what effects drinking and driving has on anyone. I recommend this book to anybody who has thought about drinking and driving or has ever been effected by it."
4,tears of tiger,"Tears of a Tiger is about a boy,Andy, who is in a fatal car crash that kills his best friend,Rob. This book was very vivid and emotional. Everything seems so real even though it is a fiction book. I thought this book was very good because it told how Andy suffered by the choices he made. I suggest this book to people who have considered drinking and driving."
5,Tears of a Tiger,"The book arrived on time, in good shape, and well packaged. No complaints - I would order again from this company."
2,Tears of a Tiger,"Tears of a Tiger is a book about a teenager, Andy Jackson, that participated in a vehicular homicide which killed his best friend, Rob Washington. After the accident Andy is having trouble coping with his friend's death. I liked a couple of things about this book. The way it was written was really interesting. Instead of chapters, it was written as English homework, phone calls, and notes. I also like the message of ""Don't drink and drive.""All in all, I really didn't like the book. It was very depressing throughout the entire book. The book never seemed to lighten up with the depression. The end was also predictable. So I recommend this book to people that like depressing books."
5,Words by Mario,Tears of a Tiger is a very dramatic dook.This teenager named Andy is suffering his best friend Rob's death. He watched him die in an explosive accident.It is a realistic book with a lot of drama. I could easily see something like this happening to me or my friends.I recommend this book for anyone who loves drama.
3,Tears of a Tiger,"This is a story all about Andy Jackson and his terrifying life. It all went good until one day they had a basketball game and they won so they went out to celebrate;they celebrated to much then andy did one wrong turn and it was all over... I would recommened this book to 8th and up,not 7th and below.They should not learn how to talk like that or treat theirselves like that."
3,Tears of a Tiger,"This book was about the some young boys celbraating the victory they had in the basketball game by driinking and driving. They geet into an acident and watch one of there close friend die in the fire traped in the car. It goees on to follow how the boy driving the caar deals withh the pain and loss of his friend and th reason he died. He does not know how to coup with this and getts depressed. His friends and family are there trying to support him but it does not help and he ends up comitting sucied at the end. It is a very tragic story that I think needs to be read by high school students. I think it teaches kids the consiquenses of drinking and driving, and all the people that aare affected by such a bad incident."
4,tears of a tiger,this story is very sad it is about a boy named gerald he was a little boy his mother was cruel for every mistake he made he got a harsh punishment like getting his hand burnt so o reccomend this book
3,Tears of a Tiger,"Tears of a Tiger is about four boys: Andy, Rob, Tyrone, and B.J. who go out drinking one night after they had won a big basketball game,and Andy, the driver, has a wreck which kills his best friend, Rob. After the wreck Andy has a hard time coping with the situation and blames everything on himself.Even though this book is depressing because of all the horrible things that happen to Andy, I still like the book. The author described it well so you could get a good picture of it in your head. She gave different personalities to each person and showed them through the notes, poems, homework assignments and the other things they wrote.I would recommend this book to anyone who has a good imagination and who would like to learn valuable lessons."
4,So So So sad...,"This book was so engaging! I literally was a wreck and had tears streaming down my face when I finished it! I was drained emotionally. The only criticism I have for this book is that it is written all in dialogue without any narration. By the end, I was used to it, but at first it was a little difficult to follow along. ... It definitely sticks with you. Sharon Draper's writing is wonderful!"
5,Tears of A Tiger through Teen Eyes,"This book was incredible! It pulls at many emotions and gets you excited about what is to come!Tears of A Tiger involves a high school where students are from a strong black american culture. The dialect is different and also their views of ""things"" are different too.These high school students have to experience the death of a superstar athlete in their school. His death is due to drinking and driving. The way the book is written is very powerful and makes teens think about how decisions that they make can change their lives forever.After the accident, the lives of everyone is changed forever. There are more difficulties that happen throughout the book, but I encourage you to read it to see just what they are!Be prepared to feel alot of emotions and tissue nearby for both girls and guys too, is a good idea. Enjoy!"
3,A little sad,"Overall, I thought this book was okay--not great, but not bad. One think that I loved about it was that you get to see what the other characters are thinking and feeling about the things that are going on in their school through their homework assignments, notes, letters, and newspaper articles. Nothing major really goes on in this book except in the beginning and at the end. The end of the book really did shock me, though. I was expecting Andy to deal with his problems in a better way than he did. If you like books that make you feel happy after you read them, then you might not want to pick up this book because it is not exactly cheerful.I recommend this book for 6th-8th graders."
1,"trite, formulatic, predictable","Paint-by-numbers prose with some sophomoric stylistic elements: letters in different fonts, changes in point of view. The racism is especially foolishly written. Save your time and your money: this ""novel"" is an embarrassment."
2,I didn't like the book I thought the book was boring.,I thought this book was boring and didn't talk enough about basketball.I only read this book because I thought it was about basketball. I was very mad when I found out it wasn't about basketball.
4,Breathtaking!,"I think that this book was a great story. It took my breath away. It really got me thinking, about life and stuff. That drinking and driving really happens every day all over the coutry. I also liked it because I thought it was sad and I like sad stories! This book was well wriitten and I hope it gets some kind of award."
5,TEARS OF A TIGER,"Tears of a Tiger is a book written by Sharon M. Draper which describes the importance of friendship. It is about a group of teenagers that are really close. They face a lot of good times and even more bad times.Throughout the book, Andy has to deal with more and more problems. He never acted the same since Rob was killed in the severe accident. He has suffered so much that he puts himself down.This book is perfect for anyone who is full of emotions or who has ever thought life is perfect because it isn't. Let me suggest one thing though, if you have had a major tragedy in your life, and you just got over the memories you may not want to read this book. This will teach you a lot of things so that you can face reality."
3,A very POWERFUL book!,"Tears of a Tiger is about a seventeen year old who was in a drinking and driving accident and one of his close friends was killed. This book tells about how Andy trys to get through it, but things seem to just get worse for him. Tears of a tiger is a very realistic book. It tells what effects drinking and driving has on anyone. I recommend this book toanybody who has ever thought about drinking and driving or has been effected by it"
5,Tears of a tiger,I honestly loved the book !! I knew it was coming ! I cried at the end but it's so true I hear things like this happen all the time .... especially being a teenager myself ! But any chance you get you should read this !! I am so worried that this would happen to my friends!.
5,Great book,"This novel is good for the story. It appeals to 15/16 year old boys, which is hard to do. The best part is that it is written using different formats; news paper article, student essay, dialogue, etc. Great for introducing these writing genere."
4,Tears of a Tiger,"Tears of a Tiger was a well-written book by Sharon M. Draper. With my personal ratings of one to five, five being the highest I gave Tears of a Tiger four stars. The book had to do with real life situations. It also included lots of easy to relate characters. It teaches teenagers what driving under the influence can really do to you. It is a tear dropping, dramatic story that ended with tragedy.Tears of a Tiger also included the tragedy consequences, and how it affected the drunken drivers family and friends."
4,Ken's Tears of a Tiger Review,"Tears of a Tiger, by Sharon Draper, is an excellent book. I loved the way it was written; the articles, phone calls, letters, and conversations were much better than a regular novel. I would love to read some of Sharon Draper's other novels. There were many exciting parts in this book, but a lot of them I don't want to give away. At the beginning Andrew ""Andy"" Jackson was in a car crash with three of his friends: Robbie Washington, B.J., and Tyrese. Robbie didn't make it, and that's what the story is about- What happens to Andy after Robbie's death. Altogether this book was really good. I enjoyed it a lot, and I would recommend it to just about anyone."
