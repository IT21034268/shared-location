2,"Primer yes, professional no","I was disappointed in the lack of depth the book provided, and as such its not deserving of using the term ""professional"" in it's title.Already a seasoned C# user, I bought this book as a reference. From a cursory glance through the TOC and index, it seemed to touch on most all the topics I come across in my daily programming. After having this book at my side on a project, I found that it offered little ""professional"" help. For those who haven't used (much) C# before, it may serve as an adequate primer. For professionals looking for the one goto book in your collection, this is not it; I'm still searching."
1,Not Helpful,"I have been programming for quit a while in Visual Basic 5.0. I purchased Visual Studio 2005 recently and wanted to try to program in C#. The main problem I have with this book is that all most all of the code examples are for Console application. I don't know why you would want to program in Console applications. I want to make Windows programs, not Console applications. I lost interest in chapter 10 when the code was still Console examples. Maybe I'm wrong in this, but I think all the code should be for Windows applications not Console applications."
1,"Starts nicely, but ends at 10000' altitude","I like the previous edition and pre-ordered this new one.I am satisfied with the first chapters, and also like the overall re-arrangement of the chapters, better than for the previous edition.Not being a web-developper, on the other hand, I cannot recommand this book for anything but trivial with databases or with GDI+. The book is hit very badly by trying to cover too much, it just miss the ""pro"" mark in many places, to be barely at the ""advanced introducion"" mark, imho. I like the new chapter on Generics, but the chapter I dislike the most is about ""Viewing .Net Data"". At the defense of the author(s), that is probably due to insane cuts made by the editor, but the end result is what the customer can read.One star, but that poor result is for the editor. Probably much more stars for the authors, at least, that sounds to have been a nice work, from the portions that seems to have been left intact."
2,Beginner Beware!,The book doesn't have enough information on how to decode a .rar extension source file. The steps on how to run your very first command prompt program is somehow misleading. Book contains a lot of technical jargons not suitable for beginner!
3,The chapter on generics could be better,I bought this book to upgrade my .NET 1.1 skills to .NET 2.0. So my focus was more on the new features of .NET 2.0. While I do agree with most of fellow reviewers that the book covers most .NET 2.0 topics I am disappointed at its handling of generics in chapter 10.In the code examples of chapter 10 generics are combined with anonymous delegates (see pages 281 and 283). This takes the focus away from the subject being discussed and does not promote professional software development practices which usually encourage simple and readable code. I would like to see this chapter re-written.
5,This is my most favorite CD I have ever heard,I love this CD.This CD is best CD I ever heard.You get all types of music.The first song on this CD is the best! Try the CD out and you will think it is the best!
5,MK At It's Best!,"I love the game series, I love the movies and I love this CD! The best tracks on it are the first,(It Has Begun,) eighth,(Fatality) and the tenth.(Spaceman) If you like techno music, buy this CD. If you don't like techno, buy it anyway."
5,"If you own the first MK album, pull out your wallet again!","Wow, where did this compilation come from? Out of the blue this little gem of techno/industrial came into my life and gave me some purely awesome samples of some truly great bands. Cubanate, Sepultura (the remix here kicks, but avoid the original version), Chemlab, The Crystsl Method, Juno Reactor, and Killing Joke all are the best! Because of this album, my CD collection jumped into the stratosphere!"
4,Hidden Jem,"Hard to find these days, but worth picking up. Lots of hidden goodies on here. Can't go wrong with Sepultura's ""Chaos B.C."". And the run from Crawlspaces ""My Ruin"" all the way up to Cubanate's ""Oxyacetylene"" is full of awesome. Alien Factory's ""Higher"" is one fast paced track that fits at home at any rave. And Crystal Method's ""Come2gether"" is good not matter what mood im in.If you avoid the warts (Like G/Z/R's 'Outworld'), you have a good time with this CD."
2,Does not fit securely on the Rustler.,"The original wheel hubs on my Traxxas rustler wore out, so I replaced them with these figuring because they were metal they would not break as easily. While they have not Broken yet, they do not fit properly on my car. I have swapped them all out to make sure I wasn't putting them on the wrong wheels, but they do not fit snugly like the original wheel hubs. They don't snap on and while will hold alright with the wheels on, they will fall off if you even tip the car slightly sideways when the wheels are off. They have not been machined properly and I would not recommend buying them. I bought another pair of the stock hubs and have put them back on, leaving these as a last minute spare, because they just are not good. I wish I could of gotten my money back."
3,Translation of Italian work.,"If you are like me, you are searching for a translation of Balducci's work. I could not find this listed anywhere, but now that I have this book and am reading it, directly in the front cover it tells that this is a translation of his Italian work ""il diavolo."" I will write a more complete review when I am done with the book."
2,Old stock,I have used this product for years and love it but not the price when purchased locally. I tried Amazon because the price was more reasonable. I was happy with the efficient delivery and processing of my order. I was disappointed the cream was dehydrated from what I have always used. I will not purchase this product again via Amazon.
1,What is the audio cd format?,"First of all I am not rating the music on this cd. The music is first class.Pure acoustic blues in its raw, powerful light. Here comes trouble. We're talking about the burnt copy of something we like to call the ORIGINAL cd. And the booklet... you'll find it on the cd itself in .pdf format (in terrible resolution). So, I am asking what is the audio cd format? The Smithsonian Folkways, a serious house as it is, should pay more attention on details like these. There are still some old fashioned listeners that won't be pleased with this."
1,Nothing we do will get them to eat what this stuff is on.,"WE had great expectations for this Alaska salmon oil product- but alas, this is not for our 2 cats.Salmon, in treats, food and rewards is their favorite taste and we feed them salmon treats for rewards with great success. Don't know what's wrong here and I can't say anything is for sure.It's just strange that our salmon loving cats don't even touch this stuff in any presentation.If we should ever feed them chunks of tire rubber, they would walk away- but eventully come backto nosh within an hour. This is their behavior and we know it well. But they will leave this stufffor hours until we remove it from their bowls. Maybe we should call the company and find out why!"
1,Robbed,"Basically, 26 min run time for $14.95 +S/H you robbed me.I did not look close enough. Fool me once shame on you.Fool me twice, shame on me."
2,Running for my 15 Minutes of Fame,"This DVD was shallow in delivery and whiny in tone. I love the idea of it, but not much else in it. Not worth buying."
3,You can do it too!!,"Very inspirational. Based on the character's story, makes you feel like anyone can accomplish anything if they work hard and set their goals high. Very easy good and enjoyable."
3,Quality but Slow,"It was not what I was expecting... slow, and not the easiest to hold, and if oyu hold the way you think you need to hold it the swicth is backwards."
3,nhl2008,"The price was right, and delivery was quick. The game disc itself has trouble starting up. I have to make several attempts to get it to play. It's not my console, because my other games start up without any problems. When this disc does finally start, it usually plays ok. But a few times it has locked up and frozen during gameplay, so I had to restart it. This is a manufacturing issue, not the seller's fault. I give the seller 5 stars, product gets 3."
1,Disappointment,"I waiting what seemed like forever for this game to come in the mail and when if finally got here, all I have to say is what a disappointment! The game looks exactly, i mean exactly like the 07 version. The new controls don't add much. They saved most of the new features and innovation for the PS3 version and threw out the 07 game with a different cover. I can't even recommend buying it for updated rosters as the ones on the game are very old, probably from 07 as well. I've always bought EA Sports games but now I'll think twice before buying another."
3,Why the NHL doesn't get it,"How do you market your sport if you can't get your video game right? This is an opportunity to grow your audience and the NHL can't make sure that all of their players have headshots!!The play is smooth and no real cheese moves like the older games.The announcing is totally random and often doesn't even match the play. ""What a hit"" .... um ... there was no check ... some guy just scored a goal.Oh well, it is what it is."
3,arrived on time,The game arrived in a timely fashion. I'm not too big into hockey so I'm probably not the best person to be writing a review on this subject. I just wanted to try something new out.
2,Not his most engaging work,"I like Mahoney's stuff because it's mind candy in a familiar setting. In order for mind candy to work, however, it must be at least minimally plausible. The willing suspension of disbelief just doesn't work here. Unlimited funds, international absolution of all sins and the treatment of foreign countries like they were just another NYPD precinct dosen't cut it. Character development is lacking here and so is the usual cast. While The Two Chinatowns gave usual protagonist Detective Brian McKenna's partner (Detective Cisco Sanchez) center stage, The Protectors gives short shrift to all of the previous supporting roles. Okay reading for a long flight, but just not the grabber I've come to expect from Mahoney."
3,More of the Same from Mahoney,"This is a continuation of the series featuring NYC police detectives McKenna & Cisco. Dan Mahoney,a former NYPD captain, with 25 years on the force, writes well and authoritatively. For my personal taste, his main characters are a bit too perfect.The plot of this novel, involving kidnappings by Basque terrorists, did not seem plausible. Mahoney always seems to manage to interject some political bias into the story. To my reading,he painted most of the terrorists rather sympathetically. My preference is just a good page turner without political messages."
4,Polarity Therapy,Timely service and as described. I really prefer to know the editions publish date as I seek issues from 1999 and newer if possible.
3,The Fan review,"I personally loved the movie and score. The reason I bought this CD was because of Terrence Trent D'Arby's Letting Go track that runs over 5 minutes long was written by Hans Zimmer, my all time favorite composer. Then, I noticed the track called Sacrifice by Hans Zimmer. It is over 19 minutes long! The great thing about this is it features so many different cues from the score put into one. Hans Zimmer did a great job on this film. But, there is only 3 stars because of the lack of score, and other tracks from the film. Like the Nine Inch Nails songs, The Rolling Stones, Santana and many more. But this CD is still great, get it immidiately!"
1,Where are all the good songs?,"Where is all the great NiN Inch Nails, remixes that I heard?????Are some of these songs even ON the Movie? I guess this is good for some people, but I don't recognize any of the songs being from the movie.Why did the just throw a bunch of songs in here that have nothing to do with the movie???"
4,The history of the Rock,Escape from Alcatraz depicts the full history of this infamous prison stronghold. It reflects how life was on the Rock and details the circumstances when and how 23 convicts attempted or succeeded in escaping from the island prison - the latter few never to be ever seen or heard of again. If you are interested in Alcatraz you need go no further than reading this book - it is really that good !
1,The most boring bokk I've ever read.,"This book is unreadable.As some others have stated, It reads like a six graders essay.A long, long tedious essay at that.If you're interested in everything you would want to know about how the prison was built and like looking at hundreds of pictures of empty cells and prison corridors, then fine, be my guest.The character development is laughable. If you CAN finish the whole book, you won't care about any of the characters - prisoners or prison staff.The short vignettes on, it seems, every prisoner who ever attempted to escape from Alcatraz, all sound the same.I can't even say anything more about this book, because it is so boring and badly written, that I'm annoyed at myself for attempting to read it in it's entirety.I finally gave up."
4,future of America,This is a beautifully conceived and photographed book of faces of people of mixed races who are wholly American. On the facing page is a handwritten paragraph of how they see themselves. It's wonderful.
5,Simple yet profound.,"My wife and I discovered this book in a cafe during our visit to the Big Island, Hawaii and immediately fell in love with the book. A wonderful portrait of mixed races with simple photographic portraits."
5,Check: Other,"I'm one of those people who gets uncomfortable when filling out applications and reaches the dreaded ""Race"" section that says ""Select only one.""I guess I'm supposed to pick whichever one I identify with the most. I usually skip that section and come back to it at the end. After staring at it for a solid half-hour, I hastily pick something and put the paper out of my sight. I try not to think about the answer I chose, and the ancestors I denied. My answer differs every time.Half my family views me as white (just ""white"" - because white people have no ethnic backgrounds or interesting cultures, right? There's no English, Irish, Dutch, German, Swiss, etc. - it's just ""white""). The other half views me as some strange Mutt they don't quite know how to interact with.I'm sick of being too white or not white enough. This book helped me realize I'm not the only one."
4,Great book,"Great book -- I just wish it was longer! I gave a copy to my sister, who has two daughters adopted from China -- so although her kids are 100% Asian, it is likely she will have Hapa grandchildren. I also gave a copy to a friend whose husband is from the Phillipines and has 3 beautiful Hapa children --- they liked the book so much, they bought copies for their children and grandchildren. Beautiful photography, and wonderful insights into being part Asian, 100% Hapa, in an anglo world. My favorite quote is from the boy who said he is 'part Danish, but I usually don't tell people that because they think I am a pastry'."
4,I am Hapa and so are my Kids... we are Hapa HAWAIIAN,"I am 100% Hapa, i was born and raised in Hawaii and i am very familar with the term and pleased to see it making its way into mainstream culture. I bought this book as a fathers day gift for my husband who is always asking why our first son looks nothings like him (he is Irish) and i am Hawaiian-Irish-Portugese.I only wish that the title of the book was more inclusive of Hawaiian and Pacific islanders who are also Hapa and originated the term."
5,What a beautiful book,"This book brought tears to my eyes, it was so beautiful and funny and cool and... I loved it. My newborn nephew is part asian, 100% hapa, and it's so nice to know he's coming into a world where he will be able to find his identity among so many other beautiful hapa!"
5,Wonderful book!!!!,"This book is really quite amazing. It brings a few good questions to mind, as well as realizations. It is interesting to read the responses to the question ""What am I"", especially from the children who all have a beautiful, raw way of expressing themselves, some in pictures, some in scribbles and some in blatently obvious answers, as if the kid would look at you and say ""what am I, I'm a kid, duh"" It really makes you think twice about asking people ""what are you""."
3,"Part Asian, 100% Hapa","I expected more. Since I live in Hawaii, I knew about the evolution of the acceptance of the Word Hapa, so that was nothing new. I guess I was expecting a more in- depth, life- experience of the various people that were included in the book."
4,"Great mirror, bad adhesive","This mirror fit our mirror frame perfectly; however, the first time that door was shut it fell out and shattered. We used the adhesive system that came with it. Next time we'll use gorilla glue instead!"
3,"Important book, crappy production....","I can't understand why a book as important and seminal as Carter G. Woodson's is still being put out with a cover design that looks like something a baby did. Don't black Americans have better respect for their own thinkers?Then, again, reading the comments of one of the previous reviewers, that it seems like Dr. Woodson wrote this ""on 12 cups of coffee"" and that it was ""wack,"" I think that a lot of young black people still don't get it."
4,Food for Thought,"The book overall is quite out-dated but it's message still has a singe of relevance. While world history is a fascinating subject, the history of your ancestors is even more fascinating. A powerful message that should not be forgotten."
3,The MisEducation of the Negro,This book written at an earlier time helps us understand the present situation of some of our African-American neighbors. It is an important work on our cultural history.
4,Each One Teach One,"Before picking this book up to read I was aware of the knowledge I needed on African American's in the Education system. After reading it I felt empowered and sad. Empowered because now I had a little more knowledge and saddened because now I know what was kept from me all my school years. It amazes me how we were not taught any of our history not even in college. It also amazes me how people got away with not educating us.Dr. Carter shows us how 30 years ago the system was designed to keep us ignorant and as experiments. Quote from Dr. Woodson ""Negroes, being objects of charity, have received them cordially and have done what they were required."" To this day they are still using the same system but I think we are smarter now and know where the resources are to get what we need.Reviewed by Missy"
4,This is a wonderful book and a neccesary reading!,"I am a twenty-four year old African American man and I read this book six years ago, and even at that young age I found it ""On point"". Dr. Woodson wrote this book over 60 years ago and his observations of social and educational conditions hold true to this day. This book was my introduction to my continuing studies of African American history, and I recommend that anyone beginning their studies begin with this book. There will be many instances when you will nod your head in agreement with what is stated, and other times when you will learn things about your own behaviors that you could not previously understand. The only reason that I couldn't give this book five stars is because it is a scholarly text and it is a little difficult for less sophisticated readers."
4,"""Oh, yeah?!? Read THIS!!""","The negative, incredulous readers/reviewers should read Psychiatry: The Ultimate Betrayal by Bruce Wiseman as the companion to this book. It very well may change your mind about your opinion of this work and others like it."
4,Must Read,I stumbled upon this book while researching a different subject. Wow! Everyone should read this book. So enlightening. People of all educational levels will benefit from the wisdom of Mr. Woodson.
5,Read this book,"This is a classic book. This was purchased for a skeptical 17 year old young black man. He has grown up in ""post-racial"" America with great grades, academic scholarship offers, and plenty of friends of all races. He really didn't understand why his black contemporaries lagged so far behind him.This book was written in 1933. That is nearly 100 years ago!!!! Yet the profound truths in this book are directly relevant today. The student loved the book and it opened his eyes. He is beginning to understand why things are they way they are.Please read and share this book!"
4,The Mis-Education of the Negro,"I found this book to be very informatative and I was pleasantly surprised by all the valueable information that was within the pages of this book. What impressed me the most was the wealth of information concerning the African American people, especially the male gender. I brought this book because I am studying the Hebrew roots of the Christian faith and this book has clarified many questions I had about why we such a hated race of people. I wish I could buy this book for ever black male and female who is not proud of who he or she is because of a lack of knowledge of our heritage, which has been stolen from us way back in the 1600's which is actually 15th century and has been replaced with the Europeans. If you have no identity than you will become what others say your are. This book should be taught to every black elementary student as a History course so that they will come to know who they really are and where they come from."
3,Rating of Mis-Education of the Negro,"It is a book that makes you look back at how things were, and how they are now. Some of the wrting I felt were quite accurate. But I did not agree with some of the things and opinions written."
5,An inciteful look at why public education has failes American Blacks,"This book, althoough written some 70 years ago, is more relevant now than when it was writtem. It points out the falilures in African American society, at all levels, as their failure to look honestly and objectively,at American life, in general, and how the promise of the American dream has failed all of its citizens. Rather than point to this main failure, it is easier for everybody to point at African Americans and see their so-called failures instead of looking at the entire general falilures with its crime, greed, lack of morality, thirst for money, etc. Until Black people take this book to heart we will be a lost people in this land of iniquity. Our promised land or dream will be realized the moment we have elevated Carter Woodson's book ""The Mis-Education of the Negro"" as our main battle cry."
5,"Pretty fly, even for white guys","I used to read this a long time ago, I loved the insight Mr. Woodson gave. He really helps everyone, especially those with less melanin, understand the plight and position of the ""negro"". I actually bought several copies and gave them out. Woodson is a great american who is undervalued and mostly forgotten. His material should be required reading for our students."
3,An overview of many aspects of the paranormal.,"This large format book contains 188 pages of text and photographs as it attempts to cover almost every aspect of anything associated with mysteries. Subjects covered include; UFOs, spontaneous combustion of the human body, lake monsters, werewolves, poltergeists, psychokinesis and clairvoyance - to mention but some. Whilst there is some interesting information to be found here and there, just as the reader begins to get absorbed in any particular subject, so the book moves on to the next.In many cases the photographic captions are difficult to find and in some cases the pictures themselves are not well reproduced.Altogether, I was left with the overall impression that this particular author did not really know his subject and had merely cobbled together a wide-ranging selection of mystery subjects.NM"
1,No pages? Really?,"so I'm going to have a really hard time using this in my class that I bought it for because it doesn't have pages within the kindle. It has ""locations""So if the teacher says ""turn to page 45"" I have to figure out where that is among like 5000 locations.Are you kidding me right now?I'm so unamused this is insaneOr if I want to make a point in class I have to figure out what page that location correlates to for my classmates to be able to follow along.grrrrrrrrrI might still have to pay $40 for the print book because this is so dumb"
4,Works good but has limitations,"Overall, the HomeRight Auto Wash Stick works well on flat surfaces but if your car has wheel well mouldings, fender flares, spoilers, air dams, roof racks, or just about anything not flat, I find it hard to get those areas. And many places can't be gotten to no matter what. It earns a 4 star because where it can be used it works pretty good. If your car is an easy car to wash then perhaps you will really like it. Mine is a hard one to wash so when I get done, I let it dry then go back and wash the areas I missed by hand. Even with that, it's still easier and quicker than washing the whole thing with a sponge. Plus the long handle makes it easier to do the roof without stretching or reaching and the lower areas without stooping. It feels a little light duty and I worry how long it will last, but if it holds up well I would probably buy another."
5,Best ever!,"This is the greatest invention since sliced bread! I don't know how I ever lived without this thing. I have tried other similar items like a chenille wash stick from walmart/target(junk) that are cheap and cheezy, but none compare to this item. This has performed great for years (I recently ordered replacement mitts from the homeright website) and washes the car like no other gadget. The long handle prevents the backache that comes from using a hand sponge and it fills with soapy water which you can squeeze out as you are washing so you don't have to keep dipping into your bucket. The fat handle is ergonomic for the hands;it is easy to hold/grip and feels good unlike the skinny metal poles of the cheap ones. The mitt can be removed and washed and the original one lasted me years before I ordered a replacement. Fantastic! I would recommend this to everyone, I hope they never stop making it!!!"
5,Great for high vehicles,"I have owned this for a year now and have experienced no problems with the cloth cover staying on. If you own a pickup truck or a higher van or suv, this is a must. I really don't use the tube to suck up water from a bucket. I found the first time that you can quickly use up the water in the bucket, but the ability to extend the tube for a longer reach is great. The cloth head comes off easily for cleaning when done."
4,Not just for flat surfaces.,"The backing for the mitt has a slight curve and fairly soft flex that does a surprisingly good job on and around door trim. Uses more washing solution than hand washing, but that is the only negative."
2,Sponge on a Stick and no more.,"Just buy a sponge mop and bucket and save $$.The head on this stick does not swivel, pivot, flex, or otherwise make it easy to use.The stick part does not fill over 3/4 with liquid. Also it has no 'lock' -- just moving the thing across the car causes the stick to push liquid out so that it empties and needs refilling just as often as you would dunk a regular sponge mop. I'm returning it."
1,Don't buy this thing!,"This wash stick is useless. It actually broke the first time I tried to use it, the 2 pieces coming apart where it extends. I got it put back together, but it wouldn't stay extended with any pressure being applied at the brush. If you only need it to wash 3' up, fine, but I threw it in the trash that day."
2,plastic and cheap,Item is made from plastic and will break if dropped at all. Pieces that are supposed to be glued together aren't or the break off real quick. Do not try to put pressure on this for scrubbing as it will fall apart. I purchased this to clean my rv..what a joke. Very messy you get soaked. Head is only about 8 inches and will take forever to do...that is if it doesn't break before your done. Don't waste your money on this!
2,OK - not great,"The soapy water fill works great - the thing that doesn't seem to work is keeping the cloth on the head. Once it gets wet it seems to fall off. Also, the curve on the part that holds the cloth on is too extreme. One other con is the odd blind, closed plastic nib opposite the head - it seems to get in the way when trying to do the wheelwells. Parts of this are well designed, but the problems outweigh the positives."
5,car wash,It is a brush to get to those hard to reach roof areas of your car. Save money do it yourself
3,Not the best,"First I will complain about how much I hate it when a company takes their floor display and reboxes it to send you as new. I had to wash the bonnet before use because it was dirty and wet wipe the handle. Just because we buy over the internet does not mean you can treat us as second class shoppers. That being said here is my review.My 3 stars only refers to the product after its first use. Used it on my lanai(patio) windows and it was quite clumsy to manuver. It made a water mess unless you tried to squeeze out the excess water which is difficult. I haven't tried it on my car yet that is coming soon, then I will update. It may have a user learning period but at first try ""user friendly"" is not its nickname."
3,This is a companion workbook.,Don't make the mistake I made thinking this book will stand by itself. It is designed to help you as a student to better understand the instructional presentation in Machining Fundamentals textbook (sold separately).
1,DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY,"THIS PURCHASE WAS A TOTAL MISTAKE! THE ""WORKBOOK"" WORD IN THE TITLE WAS EITHER NONEXISTANT OR HIDDEN WELL IN THE ENTIRE DESCRIPTION OF THE BOOK. IT WOULD MAKE GOOD POLICY IF AMAZON HAD REQUIRED THE ENTIRE NAME OF THE PUBLICATION IN THE DESCRIPTION OF IT. AFTER RECIEVING THIS ITEM I IMMEDIATELY PURCHASED A COPY OF THE TEXT BOOK AND WAS TOTALLY CONTENT WITH IT, BUT NOT THE WORKBOOK. WORKBOOK WOULD BE GOOD FOR TESTING OF A STUDENT OR LEARNER OF THE REAL BOOK. WORTHWHILE IN A CLASSROOM SETTING, EVEN NECESSARY THERE."
1,Machining Fundamentals,I never received the correct title. I ordered two times and each time I received Machining Fundamentals Workbook.
3,Beware purchasing Woodline Bits Router Bits at Amazon,"I had initially order this set of router bits form the manufacturer when I saw it was back ordered for 2 weeks minimum. I checked on Amazon and they showed they had them in stock so I ordered thru Amazon. I called Woodline to cancel the original order and the operator transferred me to the President of Woodline. He said Woodline would not honor any guarantee on the bits purchased at the Amazon site as they maybe stolen from a shipment which was intercepted in transit from Taiwan. I decided to keep both orders. The only obvious visual difference in the orders is the Woodline website order included a free packet of their shutter axial ""pins and tensioner kit"" (as advertised on their website).With the exception of the pin and tensioner kit, both sets of bits seem the same. Both seem to be good quality for the price paid. Both sets could be sharper.?????Buyer Beware???????"
1,Wait and See,"This review is not concerning performance but completion of order. I ordered set, only really wanting the slat bit, on 1/15 (Tues) and selected 2 day shipping so that I could be able to finish shutters for the weekend. Stock has been cut to size and ready for top dressings but no pin and tensioned kit. Can not complete project.Customer service said they will forward to ""tools department"" but may take 1-2 business days. Looks like another week before completion. I will post further once complete order gets delivered.On the other hand, the bits do seem to be of a little less than good quality. The cuuters do not seem to be that sharp and the paint/finish is sloppy at best. They do fell sturdy. Will shape slats on Saturday but it looks like the pieces will be ""dressed up with no where to go""."
3,My girls love this book but...,"Book is great but I do change a lot of the words, it is their favorite book right now they want it every night because of course one of my children is the big sister and the other is the little sister, but it is VERY stereo typical. For instance on one of the pages it says, ""big sister gets new clothes, little sister gets her old clothes"". Most of the book is like this, I just change the words to ""the little sister gets new clothes and her big sisters old clothes! Another line states that Big sister is neat, and little sister is not neat, again I do not want to speak those kind of words over my kids defining that one is neat and the other not, in truth the are both not very neat but getting better as they get older. i would recommend buying but feel free to change up the words when you need to like I do!"
5,Very cute book!,"Will be a wonderful addition to my nieces' library. Wonderful story that celebrates the roles of both sisters! Cute artwork, too."
5,Great family book,Bought it for my 4 year old. Her 11 year old sister loves to read it to her and the illustrations are priceless. My two boys also love this book.
5,Terrific First Puzzle,"My 15 month old daughter loves the large knobs on this colorful puzzle. Being fascinated with animals and aquatic life makes this puzzle a real draw for her. Although she struggles to get the pieces back in the puzzle due to her limited dexterity at this time, it doesn't deter her from playing with it at all! She has discovered that the pieces make great noise makers, too, when they are clapped together. The wood is a bit soft; so it will show indentations over time. However, it is holding up well so far... even through teething!"
3,Disappointing lack of quality,"Just pulled this out of the box. Size and color are great for my 18 month old. But the puzzle is wrapped in a tight clear plastic, and I can see three places where the fish sticker is already peeling. (This is not painted!) And right next to the tag stating this is wood is a tear in the plastic where the pressed paper/pseudo-wood/possibly MDF material is pealing apart in about 15 layers. Not even opened or touched by my child and it's already coming apart. What a disappointment! I will be returning this immediately, unopened.(And it's made in China in case you were wondering.)"
2,Didn't last long!,Christmas present for our daughter and less than a month later the veneer off the top of the pieces is peeling off on every single piece. We threw it away!
1,"Do not buy, wood chips residue","I would not recommend this. There are wood chips looks like saw dust remaining in puzzle, no matter how much you wipe and rinse. It's nature of wood which is made up of a few layers and friction when baby pulls it out. Like mine who puts everything in his mouth I find it highly dangerous. The company should recall this product."
4,Fish Bowl Knob Puzzle,This puzzle was an impulse buy. But was well worth it. The pieces are large and on knobs so my little one was able to use it easily. There are only three pieces so its easy to store and keep it all together.
3,meh,"I got this for my babies when they were a little younger than the recommended age, but withing moments of playing with this they had chewed the colorful sticker-like picture off of the wood part. I know it's not for chewing, but it seems like it wouldn't just disintegrate after getting a little moist."
4,good starter puzzle,"This is a good first puzzle. It is great for practicing fine motor and hand-eye coordination. Also, my son is 12 mo. old and likes to chew everything. This puzzle is sturdy and he doesn't chew away the pictures!"
1,HOT Rollers!,"Really looked forward to receiving these rollers, but they get TOO HOT!!! Burned the tips of my fingers and the clips don't hold rollers securely to hair. They are loose and floppy and end up leaving dents in the hair. Very disappointed in this product. Will be returning it."
3,Ok but not great,"I have extremely straight hair. I have tried many products to put life, bounce and curl into my hair. These were yet another disappointment for me. They worked ok...meaning I got a little body but not really a curl. The body lasted about 2 hours and then I was flat again. (just as an FYI...I have had professional body waves that do not take at all)So, my point is, These rollers work but if you have hair like mine which resists all change then keep looking."
2,PASS,I have owned 6-8 sets of hair rollers in 30 years and these are the worst! I cannot hold curl well and I had to buy clips to hold the roller in and the case is too large to store! Pass onit other products much nicer and convenient.
4,Remington H-2050 T- Studio Ceramic Heated Clip Hair Rollers,"I purchased this product 2 years ago and still use it now and then. The smooth rollers are comfortable to grip w/o over heating your hair and fingers. The rollers form a medium curl and the clip helps smooth out frizzies. I give this product 4 stars only because the clips do not hold tight enough. I find them easy to loosen or fall out even if I am sitting still. I have long, thick, wavy hair so the roller clips may hold thinner hair better; although, that may be the ones that end up with the crease."
3,Remington H-2050,"The Remington H-2050 is just OK. Yes, it heats fast, but the clips leave ""ridges"" in my hair which are very unsightly. This is something I would have wanted to know before I purchased this model. If anyone has some helpful info that could eliminate this problem, I would be happy to know. Should I just return it to Amazon?"
2,Hot Rollers - not so hot.,"I bought these and I think they suck. My hair stayed curly for maybe an hour (yes, I used hairspray). If that wasn't bad enough, I had some weird crimp mark in each strand where the clip holders were.Previously, I had a set of curlers with the metal pins that held the rollers in place. I'm returning this sad set of rollers and am on a quest to find another set with the metal pins.Don't buy these unless you like spending ridiculous amounts of money for bad products."
1,Craptastic! Going back to the store!,"I just spend an hour in the store looking at all the roller sets and sizes. I thought I had chosen the best set to achieve what I wanted. I specifically bought rollers to add volume to my straight, somewhat fine hair. I went straight home and watched a bunch of youtube videos to make sure I knew how to roll without looking like I was from the 50s. Then, I went at it. Yes, I achieved some nice bounce and curls with this set. But what I really wanted, I got none of; volume. Instead, I got some atrocious kinks and bends at the roots that I had to recurl with a curling iron to fix. That's what I was trying to avoid! So I'm heading back to the store to return this crappy set and get the kind with more of a claw clip....I hate the kind with the little metal pins."
2,curlers too hot to hold,"I bought it for my girls and I for Christmas. The curlers are too hot to be held easily while trying to roll the curls. The clips, which I thought would make the rolling easier, leave crease marks on the curls that aren't very pretty. For these two reasons I wouldn't recommend this product. I saw other products that specifically said ""cool tips"" but I sort of assumed the ends would be cool enough to hold - oh well."
2,Don't like them at all... in fact I'm taking them back!,"I have very fine hair, it's thick as in there is a lot of it.... but very slippery and smooth. I was attracted to these because they appeared to have a texture that would work with my hair. While the texture does indeed pick up my hair, these curlers made the ends crispy and it left creases near my scalp. I'll admit this is only the second set I ever bought and don't have a lot of experience with them; but I have been reading about how to use them and cannot seem to get around the creases and crispy ends! I have been trying to work with them the past few weeks in the evening and weekends, with no luck.I have no idea what type of hair would work better for these, so I can't even think of anyone to give them to. So I'm packing them up to go right back to the store! I feel bad about taking them back, but I just can't get them to work for me. I may look at some of the jumbo ones with a different clip; just buy two sets instead of one!"
1,Nothing Special,"I thought the heated clips were a great idea, and that was the selling point for me even though they were too expensive. The heated clips were NOT a good idea. They have no ""claws"" to grab onto the hair, so the curlers just slid right out of my hair. When I held my head really still I got some of them to stay in for 5-6 minutes.When I took the curlers out I was very disappointed because the clips left big kinks in my hair and the curls fell out within about 10 minutes. I am returning these and will get a set with those big bobby pin looking things or claw clips to hold the curlers in place."
2,Too much trouble to use,"I was excited about these when I bought them. Having the clips heated sounded like a great idea. Well, I've used them several times now and have decided not to use them again. The clips have flat plates on the insides and nothing to keep them in your hair well. Because of this, the curlers slide out of my hair over and over again. Also the clips leave real dents in my hair, not just minor ones. With all that and the room they take up they're just not worth it."
1,No way to avoid the crimp marks,"The clips were an attractive selling point for me, but they do not hold well, and they leave a line in my hair on every curl. Not good, not pretty, not what I want. Returning this product."
2,Not worth it,"These sound like they'd be the perfect curlers, but they're not. I have burned my fingers several times on the wide gaps in the curlers. I'd put up with that if it were the only problem, but it's not.The clips just do not hold the curlers in my hair very well. They slide out either right away or within a few minutes. The clips also leave crimp marks in my hair."
2,Discount Jungle rip off,The product is great but DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM DISCOUNT JUNGLE. They charge restocking fees and try every way to keep you from getting your money back. Buy it through someone else.
4,Good if you like electric rollers,"This is perhaps the 5th set of electric style rollers that I have owned. It's probably the best, in that it heats up very quickly, which is, after all, why I use this type of product. It also has the same flaw that most electric rollers have, which no fool proof way of fastening them so that they stay in the hair. This product has a squeeze clip that fastens over the roller, once it is wrapped with your hair. It also heats up, to transfer heat to the hair from both the inside and the out. It also will leave a ""crease"" in the lock of hair, from where is clips on. No way to avoid it. I use the rollers along with a curling brush, to smooth out the crease in the front, which fixes the problem for me. Meanwhile, if you use electric rollers in general, this set is quick, and delivers a firm curl in a reasonably short period of time."
4,Made my hair feel so soft with big bouncy curls!,"I love this! Works great and is so easy to use.The big selling point for me is IT HEATS UP FAST! My old unit takes FOREVER to heat up. I just can't wait that long in the AM so I haven't used it for a long time. This heats up in less than 2 minutes.There are more than enough rollers for my hair and I found it easy to wrap my hair around them. My hair doesn't snag on these rollers at all. The clips hold my hair perfectly and after about 10 minutes I take everything off, I spray my hair and I have a head of beautiful bouncy curls.And this thing is going to last for a long time as it's very well made and high quality.But, there's no way I can keep it on my bathroom counter. It takes up a bit more space than I have free. So, I set it up on a shelf and that works fine.I appreciate having a space in the back of the unit for the plug. No more dangling cords!I'm really happy with this."
5,Great curlers,These curlers were great. They were ready to use in under 2 minutes and after 10 minutes in my hair they left great curls. The clips did not leave lines in my hair like some other curlers and they did not get stuck in my hair. Everything packs up nicely. My hair was curly and shiny. I have never had curlers work this fast before. I love them. So far I have not been able to overheat them enough to burn myself. All you have to do is avoid the small metal strip. These curlers have been the best I have used so far. Since I started using them I have gotten a lot of comments on my hair.
2,Disappointed,"While the curlers container looks really neat & tidy, it's hard to get those rollers anchored in your hair securely with the clips. The rollers tend to flop around no matter where I place the clip onto the roller, which is the only reason I gave it such a low score. If somebody's got a trick for this, I'd like to know what it is.You can still get curls from it, although mine didn't hold very long even following up with hairspray. I didn't leave them in very long, as it says not even 5 minutes if you don't want tighter curls. It comes with a nice amount of rollers, although there are never enough large rollers for me, and I'd think of their larges as more like mediums. Decent warranty.You need to be careful to not touch the slot that attaches the curler to the heating unit, when you're rolling your hair. It's very hot.There's probably something better out there. I'm less than crazy about it, primarily from the unsecure clipping method."
3,"Best for short or thinner hair.Gave 2 stars for fast heat up beautiful curls, but my curls did not last & easy to burn yourself",I love that this heated in 5 minutes and curls were ready in 10 minutes. Unfortunately with my thick hair below my chest these curls just did not hold and easy to burn your self. I used hair spray and they were beautiful but only lasted about and hour and half. **Burn hazard* Do not let child under 13 use these without adult supervision due to burning themselves. If you have fine shorter hair you will get better results as my friend did.
1,Do not purchase!,"I bought these per the reviews that said how wonderful these rollers were. I am so disappointed. It leaves this horrible line in your hair from where the roller sits on the heating element. I thought it was a great idea having hot clips as well as the roller, but because of that, the rollers sit in the base on a line, which produces the line in the hair. The do heat up fast and the result is great, minus the ugly line it leaves."
2,BURNS YOUR FINGERS! HARD TO WORK WITH CLIPS,"I liked the look of this set (horizontal styling) and that the clip was on top of each roller.They don't call it ""DUAL HEATING TECHNOLOGY"" for nothing. Each time I grabbed a hot roller it not only burns your hair, it burned my hands!I bought this setter because it appeared to have the type of clips I'm looking for. I found the clips hard to HOLD OPEN while my almost burned hand was trying to hold the roller in place for it.My current set up is my old clairol flocked set which uses metal clips. I have since purchased a bag of the plastic clasps that work great, but wanted ones that actually ""go"" with the setter. So far I haven't found good clasps with a new setter. Seems simple enough.Someone told me to try babybliss (sp)?I've been using hot rollers for 25 years without ever getting burnt if that helps."
2,Not Hot Enough,"I was really disappointed in these rollers, they simply didn't heat up enough and lost the heat after a couple of minutes! Granted, I have very long (past my waist) hair which is difficult to hold a curl, but even using these on the very ends of my hair was not effective. By the time I left the house before work the curl was totally gone!I'm returning these pronto."
2,Leaves Creases in Hair,"I bought these last year and I have to say that I haven't used them much and I am now searching for a new set of rollers. I liked the idea of a clip instead of the metal fasteners that most sets use, but they don't hold very well. The clip also leaves a big crease in my hair on the upper portion of the hair - not pretty."
3,Ceramic Heated Clip,Pro:Heat up real fast and easy to use. Curls last pretty long.Con:Bulky and sometimes leaves a crimp line on your hair if you don't position your curls right.
1,not cool guys!,"I was searching for heated rollers and this product came up. They had this product priced low, I thought it must have been an error, but I did think that if something was posted as being available for a certain price on Amazon that they would be obliged to honor it.They didn't.They sent me a tube of hand cream as a 'consolation' instead (uh?) and a check for the amount I had paid to Amazon. NOT COOL GUYS! If you made the error and didn't 'proof' your pages you should be prepared to have people buy at the price you offered it at.I will not buy from such a company now."
1,terrible,"this, my friends, is an enormous piece of crap. it's huge and boring. the floating opera by barth is good, but this is absolute crap, one of the worst things i have ever read. the characters and the parables are so transparent as not to maintain an interest in the story.there is a lot going on, but it's just so hard to care for it. the literary style of the book is bad,nothing remarkable about it. it's just plain uninteresting chronological narration (not that chronology is bad in itself).this book should be relegated to the darkest depths of literary history, where it belongs. such profound boredom should never more harass the innocent reader."
3,only up to a point,"John Barth is as good a prose stylist as the US has produced, and this book shows it. In the first third or so of the book Barth makes the language cavort, caper, dance, sing. And it is very funny. But unfortunately the joke gets old fairly quickly. The allegory, amusing enough when its underlying conceits are introduced, gets stretched thinner and thinner, to the point where it finally gets agonizing. All through at least the second half of the book I was just waiting for it to end. On the whole, I found two of Barth's other novels,The Floating Opera and The End of the Road, much more rewarding reading, although the prose doesn't quite scintillate the way it does in the early pages of this book. Give it a try, but if at some point you find it getting a bit grating and wonder if it might get better, lay it aside and get something else to read, because it will only get worse."
3,"Not a book, but an interesting game.","This is a game by David Brin and Steve Jackson. It's fairly cheaply made - consisting of a thin black & white rulebook and a cardstock sheet of counters which you have to cut out yourself. But they weren't expecting to sell the game to the masses anyway. In short, it's a simple simulation of tribal life during the stone age. You hunt, gather, procreate and try to survive. If you're interested in anthropology or fairly quick and simple but interesting games, give it a try."
1,Horrible Leia!!!,"Well to make it look more like the Original 1977 Lightsaber Cross Poster Leia can show legs with the splits in the Dress. I dosen't look like a Guy!!! But! Has a very ""thick"" face. I Love the Freeze Frames! They are the best releases of POTF Series. And the Ewok Celebration Leia looks just like this one. So If you consider yourself the ""Ultimate Collector"" You'll buy this toy. But Beware the Dress easily comes OFF!! and underneath the body looks TERRIBLE!! It's Up to You!!"
1,Looks like Han Solor in drag,"I bought this figure for my 6 year old daughter who loves Princess Leia. What a disappointment! The doll basically has a man's facial features and a man's body (broad shoulders, huge muscles, etc.) augmented with breasts and Leia-styled hair. Extremely ugly. My daughter was very disappointed."

4,"Useful, motivating but you have to work at it.","Anthony Robbins is a powerful presenter. And he has a lot of practical good advice in these CDs. They are a bit pricey but...I found it useful to play each CD twice, really absorb what he is saying. I also try to go back every two or three months for a refresher session. And don't forget to keep the daily journal he recommends.If you are serious and put in the time, it will help you. It's a way of life not a one shot experience. It takes practice and commitment to implement his ideas, to succeed.So what else is new?Bottom line: this set is a useful self-improvement tool. But be sure to devote the necessary time to incorporate the ideas into your thinking and your actions.Good luck!"
4,Personal Power,"Use to like him when I listened, is good for getting you fired up. Not sure what to think of him getting divorced after all his marital bliss. Oh well its a concept that if you stick with some good things may happen!"
1,On the floor in seconds!,"These are terrible! Not only are they bad for the environment but my 10-month-old had it off the table, crumpled up and on the floor before I could put down the first cheerio. It was time consuming and cumbersome to peel off all four sticky strips on the back side of the placemat. Then, happy fingers barely let me get it in place before it was being ripped up. I suggest you go for a more durable placemat like the TinyDiner Portable Placemat by Kiddopotamus."
3,just ok,I bought this product before in Target and thought these were exactly the same but they are not as good. They don't stick to the table as well as the ones I bought in target.
4,Worked great for a while but now...,"I loved this product for a while, but now my baby who's just over a year pulls them off any surface and I keep having to press them back down and try to distract him from pulling them. Still preferable to the restaurant table surface though."
5,It doused my unquenchable FIRE for Tai Chi Chuan knowledge.,"This book is THE most comprehensive guide to the ""supreme ultimate art"" in EXISTANCE! This book gave me Chi Kung excercises that allowed me to actually feel the chi flow into my hands plus it talked about ALL the styles of Tai Chi Chuan, gave the philosophies and principals of each style, talked about energy extention (channeling your energy into a staff to give it the slicing power of a sword), and it reveals the ultimate attainment of any martial art, spiritual cultivation! If your fire still needs quenching after compleating this book the author includes notes and follow-up books for each and every chapter that can be expanded plus listings and addresses of other great masters! I strongly feel that the author really went overboard to give you simply THE best!!!"
3,"Pritty good, but whach for the mystic cruft","This book is prity good, some of the orgasation is funky. It acts as a omnibus. The problem is the author err's on using the mystic mumb jumbo translations. She also fails to explain that ""chi"" is just the power behind your strikes, and should act as a sumpliment to raw physical strength."
4,"A comprehensive, informative book!","This book provides introductory passages that illuminate the art of Tai Chi Chuan, and set a beginner on a path to cultivate internal energy. Translations of famous masters take up another chapter. The book covers all of the major styles, although the illustrations for each form(except for the simplified form) are probably meant for informative purposes only; they're not detailed enough that the reader could learn the form from studying the illustrations. Including chapters on martial applications, further combative situations involving the gentle art, weapons, meditation and Taoism, this book is probably the most thorough Tai Chi Chuan book out there. I highly recommend it."
3,Review,Good book but not quite what I expected in that pictures of movements not clear in which way to move
5,Fun with Bad Reviews,"Slonimsky has gathered a collection of bad reviews written about works by now-revered composers (Beethoven, Debussy, et al.)It's a revelation to see how poorly these folks were regarded--at least by some--in their own times.Well worth a browse."
5,Outstanding ladder to have available,I have this 2-story model and the 3-story model. I have already installed the mounting plate (optional). I had two different types of escape ladders and returned them both when I got this one. They cost more and were no where near the ease or quality. Don't listen to the first reviewer. This person must be refering to a different product. Key note: You don't have to install the mount. I am going to purchase another one of these for another room!
1,i hate all you people who voted 5 stars,"thanks to you, i never have faith in amazon film review. this movie stinks to high hell. i wish there was a no star option. btw this is a review from ""liberal"" people. it just sucks."
1,See For Bill Paxton,Watch the first twenty minutes while Bill Paxton is in it and then turn it off. This is an awful film. Some of the worst acting I have ever seen. Paxton's scene is the only thing worth seeing where this film is concerned.
5,"Haunting, and thought provoking...","Imagine you had the chance to go back in time to the 1920's and you met a young German Artist by the name of Adolf Hitler, what would you do? This movie deals with that question and the question of those we think are the NEXT Hitler. Each Grad student represents a liberal philosophy, distinguishing which is entertaining. I love the idea that what may seem the right thing to do in someone's mind agitates their inner darkness to surface. You will re-examine political and social philosophy after watching this movie."
5,Absolutely the best movie,"Thought-provoking, funny, dark, intelligent (despite a couple of raw takes) - I watched the movie three times in a row and still want to watch it twice as much. The ending was a bit too soon but very much in the spirit of crime and punishment in carmic point of view."
1,Don't do it !!,"Wow, what a poor, poor product! Once I determined how to install the batteries as there were none in the box ( meaning someone else had returned this to the store ), I found that I was not able to employ any of the control buttons on the display! Also shame on babies r us for simply restocking this item after someone had returned it for the same problem. They simply threw it back out on the shelf !!"
2,Waste of money buy a proper cd player,"We bought this cd player when our little one was about four months old (October 2007 or so)and this thing has had problem all over the place! It skips if you barely even hit it, which is pretty annoying. It's had issues like not playing when you fast forward to another song or stops playing for no reason (batteries were brand new). Finally the thing was acting all strange just before the holidays and then finally just stopped working all together. It would spin the cd but never play anything. So we are going to spend a little more money and just buy a compact table top cd player that will be around a while. Don't waste a cent on this one!"
1,"Terrible, skips!!","We bought this for our daughter's crib. It skips EVERY CD I put in it, even brand new ones... Nice idea, but not worth it!"
1,don't waste your money,"Terrible product! Don't waste your money. Worked for about a week - then started skipping. Tried different CD's, new batteries, etc. Ended up in the trash. Called 'the first years' costumer service - no answer. There are other products available that cost half the price and work much better."
2,"Nice Idea, Poorly Implemented","I'm a music junkie, and I'm determined to pass this particular affliction down to my son. So, when I found this crib-mounted CD player I had to have it! I loved the concept, but once put into use, I was disappointed. My experience and opinions:* Poor battery life, and the battery compartment is difficult to access.* The brackets that that hold the player onto the crib are made of the same hard plastic as the rest of the player. If you have a crib like we do with a painted finish, beware of scratches. I've lined them with felt.* Inconsistent play with ""burned"" CDs.* Overall the product feels a bit cheap.Some of this could be overlooked if it wasn't a $50 product. That's a lot of cash for a very basic CD player.A thoughtful product. Someone at First Years was thinking out of the box, but ultimately at this price point I expected more."
1,Horrible Product,"This product plays mediocre music and eats through batteries at a rate I have never witnessed before. I am not kidding when I say we replace the 2 ""C"" batteries at least weekly when all we do is play one CD as our child is falling asleep. Just because this product is marketed toward kids, doesn't mean there aren't other options. Unless you need something that attaches to the railing of a crib, there are better table top CD players available."
3,what a bummer....,This item would have been great if it was made to adjust to all of the different styles of cribs that are out there these days. This item didn't fit on our crib.
2,Batteries,This is a very nice item to have in the Nursery. be advised that you will use lots of batteries for this item.
1,JUNK! - just got it today,"I wanted it because it is so convenient looking for travel and saves space hanging on the crib. It is cheaply made, the plastic and the buttons feel as if they will fall apart.The picture on the box showed a repeat button. The CD player in the box does not have a repeat button so you cannot run the CD player continuously.I don't know why people are complaining about the batteries, every parent with young children and all those gadgets they have should have a supply of rechargeable batteries!"
1,Horrible Product!!,"I thought this was going to be an excellent item for my newborn son to listen to music while going to sleep at night, BUT... It eats batteries and the volume is so low that we can not even use it during the day when he is playing in his crib. The idea and concept is great but the quality is terrible. I would not recommend it to anyone. A small plug in unit is your best bet!"
5,Worked for me!,I think this CD player works as well as anyone can expect. It fit on our crib fine and I don't find that it skips a lot unless it's seriously knocked into which rarely happens. It does eat up batteries but that's ok because my son seems to love it and that is worth it!
1,Battery Eater!!!!!!!!,"Boy, what a great product this would be if it didn't go through batteries like I go through the crab legs at the Panda Buffet! The darn thing doesn't have a shut off button either. So, when you press play you better be there at 4am to shut her off when the CD stops or there goes that set of ten dollar batteries. The Cd player also has a problem with skipping so don't touch or hit it, just let it do it's thing."
1,WARNING - A WASTE OF MONEY,"I bought this item only to return it less than a week later. This is one of the most poorly thought out and designed items that I have ever bought.Hope you don't have an active baby - the CD skips at the slightest motion.Hope you like to buy lots of batteries - I have NEVER had an item go through batteries as quickly as this did!Hope your child doesn't wake easily - the poor design of the tiny function buttons makes usage awkward and cumbersome.Hope your child has super hearing - it is impossible to hear the music (which is actually a blessing, because the music sounds like it is being played in a tin can).Buy a regular CD player and put it in your child's room."
1,WASTE-O-MONEY,What a waste of money. It sounds like the CD's are playing from inside of a tin-can. Please save your money or buy/register for a normal desktop CD-Player with a remote control that you can turn off from the door when the baby is asleep.
3,So far so good!,"I recently purchased this item and I have to say, so far it's working GREAT! Some complained about the sound NOT being loud enough...well I had to turn it down cause I felt it was too loud! Besides isn't the idea to put them to SLEEP! So far as the nightlight...have to agree it's dim...but that's NO biggy to me. If your thinking of buying it do so and simply keep the BOX and the receipt (as you should with ALL baby items you purchase). I also found the First years monitor with 2 receivers to be great as well and it's priced just right (I purchased an expensive one and got nothing but ANNOYING static)."
2,Not worth the money,I thought this would be a great idea. So when we found out we were having twins i ran out and bought 2 of them. We started to put the nurserys together and when it came time to put these on they wouldnt fit. I didnt want to stratch the crib rails up so we took them back. When we did try to play a cd in them it skipped. We ended up just buying small cd/radio players for each of their room because this is something they can both use for a long time.
1,By a CD player that is reliable and will last,"I had wanted a CD player that would play lullabies for my son to help him relax and go to sleep. I returned this player 3 times before completely giving up on it. Every model I brought home failed to play an entire CD. It didn't matter whether it was sitting on a table or mounted on the side of the crib. It would stutter, skip, or just plain stop.For the same price, I bought a great little colorful Sony boom box with a ton of features that hasn't missed a beat. What's even better - it will be useful to my son when he is old enough to play his own CDs and carry it around - a much better investment."
2,"The idea is great, the product lacks quality","I simply love the idea of having a CD player by the crib. Music really soothes the babies (I have twin boys) and they love it.I was so excited when I got it at my baby shower and it was the first gift I opened, but what a disappointment it was!!!It skips very frequently, sometimes it doesn't even turn on, the sound has no quality and it consumes so much batteries that I probably spent money enough to buy a good sound system.Problem is that I was so excited I threw away the box, otherwise I would return it!"
3,"It's a good idea, but on a table would be better","I loved the idea of playing classical and multilingual CDs to my daughter as she fell asleep, which we still do every night (she's 15 months old). This was a great product until she learned how to stand up in the crib and grab it! She shakes on it quite a bit, which obviously makes the music skip around. And as the others have noted, it does eat up batteries quickly and the nightlight is VERY dim. I'd recommend a plug-in tabletop CD player/boombox over this product any day."
2,BATTERY GOBBLER,"After changing the batteries on this CD player for the umpteenth time in six months, I feel compelled to write a review...This CD player is a good concept, but I would recommend parents to just get a small plug-in unit instead. This player eats batteries as if they were chocolate. Also, the volume doesn't go up very high -- presumably because you don't want to hurt baby's ears -- so it's not really loud enough to listen to sing-alongs when you're playing in the room. I wouldn't call it ""junk,"" but it's not really a sound investment either."
1,I recommend getting one that plugs in,"I recieved the CD player at my shower, and loved it. But had to go through batteries every week. So I am taking it back and getting one that plugs in."
2,DONT BUY THIS OR REGISTER FOR IT ITS A WASTE OF MONEY,"I MUST SAY I WAS PRETTY EXCITED WHEN I SAW THIS AND I WANTED IT FOR MY NEW BABY. WHEN I WAS SETTING UP HIS NURSERY I PUT IT UP AND THRU THE BOX AWAY (BIG MISTAKE) AND AFTER HE WAS BORN WE PLAYED AROUND WITH IT A BIT. IT USES BATTERIES UP SO QUICKLY, THE LIGHT IS REALLY NOT VERY IMPRESSIVE, THE CD SKIPS ALL THE TIME, THE PLASTIC COVER THAT GOES OVER THE CONTROLS DOES NOT MOVE SMOOTHLY. YOU WOULD BE BETTER OFF BUYING A CUTE LITTLE BOOMBOX AT THE STORE ...I HAVE HAD BETTER PRODUCTS FOR 5 DOLLARS AT BIG LOTS. REALLY!! SO TAKE MY ADVICE... BUY A LITTLE RADIO FOR YOUR CHILDS ROOM THAT HAS A CD AND TAPE PLAYER. THEN YOU WILL STILL HAVE MONEY LEFT OVER FOR DIAPERS..... I AM GLAD THIS WAS A GIFT AND I DIDNT SPEND MONEY LIKE THAT!..."
2,Not worth having,We thought this sounded like a great product and quickly purchased this for our baby girl's use on her crib but it was a BIG mistake. Where to start...The CD player isn't well made at all and skips very easily. The night light feature was very DIM and weird. The player really eats up batteries and it is hard to operate--we're taking it back and getting a regular CD player for her room. I wouldnt recommend this to anyone because in the end it is a huge waste of money. There are other products out there that could do the same for a lot less and will in the end last longer.
1,IDEA IS A WINNER BUT PRODUCT NEEDS WORK!,"I HATED this product! I absolutely HAD to have it, and I was so excited about receiving it at my shower. Boy, what a let down. This thing eats thru batteries like nobody's business! If you are playing a CD, make sure you or your baby doesn't so much as tap the side of the crib or the CD will skip. You need BOTH hands to open the safety cover and the light, even though it was very dim, kept my baby occupied and stimulated staring at it because it was so close to her!I'm all for soothing music and lullabyes, but I'd say wait until they improve on the product itself before making this purchase! I put a regular old radio/CD player in the room and I'm much more satisfied with that."
1,save yourself the agony,"This product is awful!!!Poor button navigation, battery life, design, you name it. Not to mention lousy sound quality.You learn things after you have a child. Fumbling for buttons at the wrong time becomes a lesson in frustraton.Save yourself and get a twenty dollar anything-other-than-this CD player. It's over priced ""baby gear"" you can live without!"
2,Don't waste your $ on this one...,"A good idea, but a bad product. The sound quality is horrible and the CD skips. It doesn't have an AC adaptor so be prepared to use lots of batteries! We removed ours right away and returned it to the store!"
2,Broke after 5 months,I thought this player was great -- it is a nice space saver. I had it on the crib and it played fine. I didn't have the volume issues others wrote about -- the volume adjusted fine for me. It would have been a great product had it not stopped working - for no reason. It's dead. I did go through lots of batteries- but that would have been the case with any cd player I believe. Too bad -- I have to return it since it no longer works.
2,Invest in batteries.,"The thing functions okay, although I haven't figured out whether or not the timer helps or hinders matters. I know that no matter whether it plays all the time or the timer is set, this cd player uses up batteries faster than anything I've ever witnessed, and this is my third child! I would not invest in this product again. A simple boom box on the dresser would have produced the same results and would have been more versatile. I'm normally a fan of first years products, but this one doesn't cut it."
1,Buy a cheap cd boom box instead!!,"Not loud enough! Shuts off after cd is played, I wanted a repeat button. CD skips alot, light is too dim. The positive point is that it clips nicely to the crib."
1,Not Worth Your Money,"I thought this was going to be a great item compared to the older version which only played nature sounds. I liked that I could either play music or my own nature cds. However, my 12 month old figured out how to move the player back and forth on the crib rail and eventually how to remove the player from the rail. This allowed him to remove it and stand on it in his crib or to throw it out onto the floor. I found it amazing that the player did not lock into place and therefore caused a safety hazard. I would not recommend this item to anyone. I would suggest investing your money into a small cd/radio for the dresser top."
1,Don't even bother,"I registered for this item because I thought it would come in handy despite the negative reviews I had read. I should have listened to my gut instinct. the player only worked a total of 3 seconds and when I called the 800 number they said just take it back, like they knew the item was defective and they were used to hearing about it. I exchanged it for the tape player and that didn't work at all so back to the store I go. Don't waste your time or your money."
1,to those who already purtchased this product,"already reviewed this product, but just read some more reviews. To those that want to return it, but do not have a receipt- CALL FIRST YEARS! I have returned two without a receipt, and the shipping was FREE! Do not bother with returning to the store. The store generally just puts your defective product back on the shelf to sell to another unlucky consumer. First Years is a good company and they need to know how bad their product really is. If they have to keep paying for replacement products and shipping regularly maybe they will just recall this hunk of junk like they should have months ago."
4,Use your own judgement,"I got this cd player because I had such a hard time finding lullibies on tape. I had read the other comments but thought I would give it a try anyway.Bad points- It DOES skip when its hit, so don't hit it. The light IS dim, so what? I want the kids to sleep not see what to get into! The music IS low even on the highest setting, but then again the whole house isn't listening to it.Good points- It plays the whole CD then shuts itself off. (At least mine does!) It uses CDs which can be found ANYWHERE. Its small enough that I can put it on the wall side of my crib and I know my other children CAN'T play with it!! The buttons are a pain to get to, but thats GREAT where kids are concerned, right??As for the batteries, I've had mine a few weeks, play it EVERY night and have yet to replace the batteries.I happen to really like mine. Give it a try, save your receipt and make up your own mind."
1,what I think,"The Crib CD player hardly ever works, and if it does, it goes through a set of batteries with each CD you play. I definatly do not recommend anyone buying this product"
1,CHOKING HAZARD,"This product has little knobs under the cover that can easily break off if you have a curious toddler.Do not buy this product. A CD player on a nightstand is just as effective at soothing a baby to sleep. There is no need to have the safety of your baby sacrificed for this ""unneccessary"" little gadget"
1,Buy a CD/Clock instead,"While the concept of this product is good, since it is not built to accomodate the new style cribs with wider sides and trim, my wife and I returned this immediately. Instead of buying this unit that requires batteries, I would recommend spending the $50 on a CD/Alarm clock (Sony makes a nice one)- now you can play your CDs and, since it plugs in, you don't need to go through batteries. This will also last a lot longer for your child."
1,I'm very disappointed!,"I saw this unit advertised in one of the Babies R Us catalogs and I talked for weeks about getting it. Since the closest store to us is still about 30 miles away, it took me a while to actually get it. I was so excited, came right home and installed it. And to my utter disappointment, the unit was a piece of junk. I tried several CDs on it, but it would only play them if the unit was laying down (not hanging from the crib side -- what's the point!). And when it would finally catch on and start playing, it would skip like crazy. I'm making another trip to the store to return this tomorrow. What a disappointment!"
2,Good idea - very poor quality,"I had triplets and bought 3 of these. I ended up returning each one, multiple times. The buttons broke easily, it constantly skipped and consumed endless batteries. On the flip side, the kids loved the music."
2,Agree w/ Waste O Money,"I purchased this item at an additional 30% off the ""clearance price"" thinking this was a great deal regardless of the quality. Wrong. I returned it. I will buy a regular CD player that actually has sound and can be controlled from afar while baby is sleeping. Save your money and invest in a regular CD player. Baby will love you for it."
4,Does the trick,"I really like this CD player. I do not understand why it has such a low review.*Yes the light is dim but I did not want a bright light. It is a nightlite. It is just fine. I can check on baby and see him fine.*The volume does not get very loud but for what this is designed for it is fine. I put in a lullaby CD and he drifts off to sleep.*The timer function if great.*The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that I wish the digital readout and the buttons lite up. It is hard to see in the dark and I do not like to turn on the light to see the buttons and digital read out. Maybe in the next version the manufacture will include this.*As far as the CD's ckipping when hit, I solved that by sliding a piece of foam between the play and the rails of the crib. No there is no space to move at all and it does not skip.***It is not perfect but it does the trick!***"
1,Piece of Junk!!,"The second day of use I started to get ""ER"" when I pressed play. So you have to play this game of start..stop..start.. to try and get it to play. So I exchanged it. BTW - Great customer service at First Years. Same thing happened to the new one. Now just the light works and the I can't get the CD player to do anything. We are now using my clock radio CD player which he'll be able to use through college if he wants for half the price.DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY...TRUST ME ON THIS ONE!!"
1,This thing is pointless!!,"First off, it skips all the time. While I was trying to pat my baby's back, I bumped the crib and it skipped. While I was across the room rocking her in the rocker, it skipped. 2/3 times it would give me an error message. And when it would work, it would have an error message within 5 minutes later. After exchanging it for a new one and getting the same results I called the manf. and they told me to try some things. I cleaned it (although it was brand new) and put another set of NEW batteries in it and it still didn't work. To sum it up, if I could rate this at 0 stars I would. I am buy a regular radio. ..."
2,Batteries won't last,"The batteries seem to die every few days! It happens so often that we run out of batteries and then the CD player sits, useless, for long periods of time until we get around to getting new batteries. We've hardly gotten to assess the rest of the features because it's been useless more often than it's been useful. I wouldn't recommend this product unless you have a LIFETIME supply of batteries handy."
2,it gets worse before it gets better...even dangerous,"we have had this product since our child went into a crib. the music was fine in the early years, and the product presented few challenges. ever since our daughter could pull herself up and fumble with the device, it has been a little dicey.today was the very worse, as our inquisitive daughter got her finger stuck in the back where the attachment clips go. it turned out to be some trauma of dis lodging her finger, but it truly could have easily been a broken or amputated finger within minutes of our arrival. this has to be reviewed for safety sakes. it is truly a terrible accident waiting to happen"
1,A Big Disappointment,"What a disappointment! We were so grateful to receive this at a baby shower- it was something we really wanted. However, it did not live up to expectations. The sound quality was awful- very, very quiet even on the highest volume setting and, even worse, extreme static. I exchanged it for another one thinking that maybe the first was defective but had the same problems. For such an expensive item the quality is very poor.We ended up ordering the Fisher Price Tape Player online and it is really wonderful. We love it- buy it instead, better quality and cheaper!"
4,Worth buying!,"I love my cd player. My baby uses it every time she goes to sleep...at night and for naps. I like it cause it shuts off itself. I gave it 4 stars cause I wish it would play louder,...but it truly is worth buying!"
4,I like this Crib CD player,"Even tho these crib CD players were manufactured quite a while ago, they are still available; I bought mine at a Goodwill store. It was wonderful when our grandchildren were in cribs, but they still enjoy it when they come to spend the night. I guess it never occurred to me that an infant would need stereo sound. The volume level is sufficient for an child, since the idea is to lull the baby to sleep and not to ruin the child's eardrums. The nightlight is just enough for a child to feel safe, and yet not bright enough to keep him/her awake. Yes, it is difficult to replace the batteries but as any grandparent can tell you, if something is hard to open, give it to a child. I wouldn't want it to be easier, for safety reasons. Our 6 yr old granddaughter is staying the night and is thrilled that I found the missing CD player which I can hook onto a standard headboard."
1,rip off!,"I can't believe they charge so much money for something of such poor quality . . first years is ripping you off! its super junky quality plastic , seems to be really easy to break, really loud CD opening compartment, everything about it plus what everyone else said. . this should only sell for about 20.00 and i've seen the MSRP all the way up to 60.00!!!!! this is in no way worth that much money by any stretch of the imagination . Of course you gotta check to see if it will even fit on your crib depending on the type of side rails you have. just save your time and buy a regular cd player that has better durability and higher quality, it'll last longer anyway. this is junk."
4,Very helpful for bedtime routines,"My husband and I wanted to buy this for our kids to play the lullabye CDs people had given as baby gifts, but we couldn't justify paying $50. I happened to find a used one at a rummage sale for a dollar! Much more reasonable.PROS: plays any CD; good volume control for a crib (a baby doesn't need surround sound to fall asleep); battery compartment is secured well; ""C"" batteries are best as rechargeables for something like this, since it's used every day; optional timer and programming buttons are good to customize baby's routine; dim nightlight is just enough for you see where the pacifier fell while you reset the music in the middle of the night without waking babyCONS: PRICE; CD door takes two hands to open and is noisy; I kind of wish it had a optional wall-mount or desk base for post-crib use"
1,A COMPLETE WASTE of MONEY!,"Don't waste your money on this item. It easily breaks. Worst of all, the sound quality is for the birds. You would be better off purchasing an alram clock radio with a CD player. You can keep track of time (as you monitor feedings every 2-3 hours) and utilize a CD player that can continuously play music with excellent sound quailty. We returned this item as soon as we heard the poor sound quality."
2,Not handy,"While this is a nice product, I ended up returning it for several reasons: 1) The two C-batteries were not convenient or easy to replace (need a screwdriver each time), 2)The CD changer compartment takes two hands to open and it makes a loud noise -- not good for a sleeping baby, 3) The music is not in stereo sound.You're better off with a mini-boombox that plays both CD's and cassettes -- not only for convenience and sound quality but for the price."
1,Absolute waste of money,"Like many new parents, I have faced a lot of gimmicky items in the baby business. This is one of them. But this one costs [price]. I wonder if First Years counts on this item being a baby shower present that will be thrown out instead of returned.The concept is a good one. Since babies like music, place a small, portable CD at cribside. I wanted it to soothe my son while I changed his diapers. Was I mistaken!! The unit skips repeatedly. It drives me to distraction, never mind the affect on a newborn. Furthermore the speaker output is so tinny, Edison's ""Mary Had a Little Lamb"" sounds better.Inserting the batteries were a chore as well. I can't report on battery usage since my wife and I do not use the thing any more. Considering that the Discman has been out for a decade, I was very surprised by the Crib CD Player's poor quality.Thank goodness we kept the box."
1,Too Bad You Can't Rate Less Than One Star!,This product is a piece of junk!. The player skips constantly and the batteries only lasted a couple hours even though I used the 15 minute timer only twice!. I had the same problems as everyone else has described. I would not recommend buying this product. Get a mini-boombox instead.
2,Save your money.,"Great concept, however you are better off buying a small cd/radio alarm clock. We use this cd player everynight for the first 3 months of my daughter's life and she falls to sleep to it everytime. We didn't have any problems as everyone else did BUT the only complaint we do have is that it doesn't last too long with batteries. We got tired of recharging those batteries and unscrewing the back to change the battery(safety feature, I guess)...So we went to Target and bought a small cd/radio alarm clock(with an outlet plug, of course)......it worked out great for us."
4,I think it's great!,I really love this player; the light is just right for a baby; the sound is very good;I can hear it playing in the baby's room from my room at the other end of the house. My only complaint is it is hard to open but in a way that is ok too; we don't want the baby playing with it! I highly recommend this item. I may have to buy another because my 8 year old uses it after the baby is asleep!
1,What a disappointment!!!!,"I too wish that 0 was a rating option!! I was so excited at the thought of having a crib CD player!! Boy, what a major dissappointment!!! This CD player is sooooo quiet that even when you turn the volume all the way up, you can barely hear it. My 9 month old loves music and so I went and bought a lot of children's cd's. I ended up purchasing a little CD player and placing it on the table next to his crib in order for him to be able to hear it."
2,defective and a waste of money,"The 1st CD player that we received was defective and we had to return it( returning gifts is the last thing you want to do with a newborn). The 2nd CD player worked but it was such a letdown. The volume is very low, even on the highest setting. It eats batteries. You can only use it while the baby is in the crib(because the volume is so low you can't hear it unless you are in the crib or right next to it.) I would have much rather had a portable CD player... Now that my baby is crawling the Cd player is virtually useless. If I had a portable CD player, I could bring it into his ""playroom"" or the living room so that he could listen to music while playing.."
1,Waste of Money,"You can just as easily spend $50 on a regular CD player and not have all the problems. The batteries don't last!! They are very hard to change. You have to remove the light which is near impossible to get to the batteries. In the beginning, I was using this every night to get my daughter to sleep & then one night our whole routine is off because this wouldn't play. And it had only been a week!!! The thing skips horribly. It was the worst baby product I recieved. I went out and got a CD player alarm clock for $40 and have had no problems. You will spend more on batteries for this CD player then the $50 you spend to buy it."
1,We hated it,The volume on ours was not very loud. It skipped and was hard to use. We returned it and got a high chair instead. It is not a very practical thing.
1,Not Worth It!,"This CD player which seemed like a nice addition to my son's nursery was such a waste. I would recommend purchasing a more reputable player for your childs room.If you have a custom crib like I do, the player will not fit.The batteries are CONSTANTLY going dead and a total pain to change.In addition, it skips all the time!Not worth the $."
3,Not a bad product,"To be honest, we received this as a gift and you have to take into consideration why they made this CD player. I use it to play songs for my small son while he's laying in the crib. True, the volume doesn't go that loud but it's not intended to be a boom box. It's the perfect volume for the little. I personally have never had to change the batteries yet and my son is four months old. We probably use it three times a week, maybe twice a day. I still only use the trial CD that comes with it.As for durability, I have a Childcraft Crib and have not had a problem with it sliding off the crib. It's a nice complement but I would have rather received as a gift then purchase on my own."
1,The sound is terrible,"I registered for this and was too embarassed to take it back, but there truly is nothing good to say about this cd player. The sound is very very low (goes from inaudible to barely there), the nightlight function is controlled by a teeny tiny button impossible to find unless an overhead light is already on (what good is that??), all the buttons on this are ludicrously small, difficult to use, and impossible to find without waking the baby, and switching cd's in cumbersome."
1,Terrible Design,"This has got to be one of the worst baby products AND worst CD players I have ever owned. Yes it plays CDs, but that is about it. My main issues are: (1) opening the CD player or the control shield is extremely noisy and difficult; (2) the volume range is nowhere near wide enough (the unit is very quite); (3) the light is useless when the unit is mounted on a crib rail. I would not recommend this product!"
4,proud mama,"I really dont agree with the other reviews on the cd player. I can hear the player on high from a good distance and really only use the player when she is going to sleep, so how high does it have to go? I dont keep it on high as not to keep her awake, and the only issue is the light doesnt shine as bright as I thought. I keep it attached to the crib not near her head either.I dont get what the other reviewers dont get. Mine works great"
1,Worst. Product. Ever.,"Lame. Batteries are a pain to change and will only play CD's 2 or 3 times befor needing a change. Sound quality is pathetic and not loud enough at full volume. Out of all the ""stuff"" we spent our money on, this was the worst buy."
1,Crib CD Player with Night Light,"Don't waste your time and money on this product. Everytime you play a CD, it displays an error message and does not play the CD. You have to keep cleaning the laser lens for it to work. It is almost adult proof to open the cd door and it opens only about a quarter of the way. You can barely hear anything with the volume turned all the way up. Your best bet is to buy a small cd player for the same price and you'll get more for your money!!"
3,Crib Player serves it purpose,"Our 9 month old listens to the same lullaby CD every night while I rock her before she goes into the crib. I bet I change the batteries at least 1X a month, which I guess when you play a 30 minute CD 30X, the batteries would tend to wear down. My biggest complaint is getting the back open/off to change them! Even after 10X changing them I STILL struggle for 5 minutes with the contraption! It is also very testy to any movement, it will definately skip if you even touch the crib while it is playing.I do like the timer feature, I can set the timer, and it will go off in approximately 10 minutes."
1,So Disappointed!,"I registered for and received this CD Player, since it is the only one of its kind. When I went to set up the nursery I was so disappointed to discover that it was not capable of adjusting to accomodate any crib. Unfortunately because of the width of the rails on my crib, It didnt fit. I was so excited about this product, especially because its hanging on the crib was a space saver. SOmeone really needs to manufacture a like product.My advice?? be sure you have thin rails on the crib before investing in this CD Player.Good Luck!!"
1,needs to be recalled,"The first one stopped spinning the CD and used up the batteries after a week of only playing an hour a day. I returned it the 2nd one is using the batteries as much as the first one. I am very disappointed. I feel it needs to be recalled. I want my money back,babies r us does not give money back and they do not carry another brand CD player."
1,Watch Out For The Unlabeled Religious Imagery,"Towards the end of tape religious imagery is used. Something about imagining yourself in the hand of god.There is nothing wrong with that, but I felt that the tape should have had a warning on it for people who do not share the author's religious beliefs."
5,"I was at my wit's end, but no more.",This book has given my the directions to deal with all the problems I face everyday with my children. I was going crazy with convern and worry because my family was dealing only with problems.I read the book and starting doing what Dr. Cathryn suggests and found that it has made a difference in my life and my children's lives.Thank-you Dr. Cathryn !
3,"RE: Melancholy tunes with a Blues-Pop Sound,","This really is a good movie, and the soundtrack is also strong. In response to Payjean's review, the song that's played while keener is following corrigan is 'go west' by liz phair. it's too bad it's not included on the soundtrack, but it's on liz's 'whip smart' disc, which is, itself, worth searching out. The billy bragg songs on this soundtrack alone are worth taking the time to pick this up. Still, i'd probably suggest getting a vhs or a dvd of the movie if they're available, instead of just this disc."
3,Needs something more to keep your attention,"I don't know, it could be just me but I think that they could have done a better job of keeping your attention. One of my family members is an avid golfer and even for him it took a long time before he got bored enough to try to finish it."
4,Good at first part,"This book is good at first part, which provides the basic understanding on cryptography. But it is not understandable for the second part on modern algorithms and public key. I still cannot understand the advantage of modern algorithms over the ancient cryptography.The chapter Key Management seems to long for such a small issue, while the modern algorithms seems to short for such a big issue."
5,Excellent for a beginer,This is for the ones entering into security practiceIt is short and accurate if security is for you with this book youll discover it.
4,A very useful introduction,"If you want an accurate introduction to the concepts and vocabulary of cryptography, this is the book for you. The authors are clearly knowledgeable but manage to make the information provided accessable to the beginner. There are simple examples to acquaint you with some of the principles of coding and breaking codes. This is a complex subject and some of the ideas will take you into deep water. There is an excellent bibliography that one can refer to for more technical details. The book would benefit from a glossary of acronyms as some of the terminology was hard to keep straight. There could have been a little less discussion of key management. Over all a very useful and informative book."
3,Quality Tool,"I purchased this 60 cutter to clean and re-surface the 9/16"" lug nut holes in a set of wheels. This is a quality tool. Comes with a slide-together plastic storage case."
5,Love this CD!,"My son insisted that we buy this CD. It was a very 'thought-out' piggy bank purchase, and he couldn't be happier. At 5 years old, he is a huge Jonathan Sprout fan. The music is fun and educational, making me a huge fan as well! Perfect for school-age kids, and I'll admit that I'm learning some things too!"
5,A must have if your a fan.,"This DVD is awesome. It is shot with a digital camera, and it looks High Def, really. You can control the camera angles, if that's your thing. I love to watch it while working out, there is so much energy! Enjoy!"
4,Nickleback dvd,I bought this for a christmas gift.The dvd was a great deal with good reviews so i purchased it for my brother.
1,Live at home.,"Sadly im a canadian from alberta and have to live with the fact that this dvd and band are from my home. Nickleback sucks, and the quality and set list of this DVD is garbage. Save your money!"
4,"""Live at Home"" Tracks","I always drives me CRAZY when CD & DVD music videos don't include the songs on them. So, here's the List...Nickleback ""Live at Home""Tracks:1. Woke Up This Morning2. One Last Run3. Too Bad4. Breathe5. Hollywood6. Hangnail7. Worthy to Say8. Never Again9. Old Enough10. Where Do I Hide11. It Ain't Like That12. Leader Of Men13. Mistake14. How You Remind Me"
5,My two year old LOVES this simple book and so do I.,"My 2 year old was given this book as a hand-me-down. We read it to him and he has insisted on reading it again, and again, and again.... I'm sure this book will be a long-time favorite!"
4,Dinosaur and not dragon,"My 2 year old called this a dino and not a dragon and doesn't relate to wood stoves, different era I suppose. But from the first day he reads this 5 times in a row so it must be fun for him. I don't love that ever since he asks for milk and cookies at night..."
3,Not very user friendly,"This is an older text and not very lively. No photos or drawings to liven up the rather analytical approach to learning a language. However, it is authoritatively written. I wish I had had more choices of books to choose from."
4,Decent magazine for young children,"My four year old enjoys receiving Ladybug magazine in the mail. It has sweet little stories and is somewhat entertaining. However, he much prefers National Geographic Kids and High Five. Not sure whether it's the nature of the content or the style/layout, but it's not the biggest hit in our house."
5,My neice loves it!,I gave this to my 2 year old neice as a gift. She loves being read to plus there are things in each issue she can do. I have been told that it was a great gift idea and much enjoyed.
4,"good magazine, not sure if its for a little older...","We just got our first issue of Ladybug Magazine. My 2 1/2 year olds enjoyed it, but I think some of the stories in there are for older children, probably a year older than mine are. That said, the publisher does give a range (2-6, I believe)and I do think that the kids will grow into enjoying all the features of the magazine. Its nice to have something other than Highlights, which the kids also enjoy."
5,We love it!!,"Ladybug magazine is fabulous. After subscribing for a few years, my girls in first grade are beginning to read it themselves. Their 10-year-old brother reads to them as well. They know all the regular features, and dance around when it arrives in the mail."
2,Reading,This book appeared to be an interesting read. i was disappointed after I read the first chapter. Not as good as it appears.
4,The absent Author (Ato Z mysteries),I am a primary teacher and I was looking for books to use with my higher readers. This series of books was suggeted to me and I am very thankful. My first graders love them and I am working on buying the complete set.
4,Fun Mystery,"A group of kids awaits a book signing with their favorite mystery author, Wallis Wallace. But the author never shows, and the kids find it strange. As they follow clues, they think Wallis Wallace has been kidnapped.I like this book because it's pure kid imagination. It's what kids wish would happen. Who didn't want to be part of a mystery crew like on Scooby Doo or this A - Z Mysteries crew? The start to this series is imaginative, fun and keeps you interested."
3,The Absent Author Book Review,"This book was pretty good.It made sence,but it wasn't the best book I've ever read .I would reccomend it to a third or fourth grader, because it's about their reading level. The Absent Author was sort of exciting, but not really...."
1,Silly me,"I am very fond of mysteries and psychological dramas, and was very disappointed when I read this purchase, as it took me 10 minutes to do so. Somewhere in the listing there should be a word or two about the age appropriateness of the book being offered. I may have liked it if I was in 2nd.grade. This experience has caused me to re-consider looking at the Daily Deals.I guess I should have realized the title indicated a juvenile selection, but I thought of Agatha Christies ABC Murders , not a kids book, so took a chance at this one.Now I know my ABC's."
1,not as described,bracelet looks like what is shown but it is 7 INCHES in length absolutely NOT 9 INCHES stated in description. lost return info and guess will have to give it to someone else since it is two inches off. Very DISAPPOINTED.
2,Fades,"Beautiful item it is as pictured, but the color tarnishes very quickly! This is a problem! Don't waste your time!"
5,FANTASTIC,"Dear guys, I have a bunch of Canon L lenses and I say to you that none of them can match the EF-S 17-55mm F/2.8 USM IS in terms of image quality. This is simply the best lens ever for cropped sensor cameras PERIOD! I recommend...! By the way, I bought it from Adorama and got it the next day!!!! Amazing!!!! I love ADORAMA!"
3,"Great lens, but needs dust proofing","I love this lens as an all around, walkabout lens. Unfortunately, the lack of weatherproofing/dust proofing makes the lens less desirable, especially for the price. On a recent trip, although I got very nice photos, the lens acquired a significant amount of dust inside. On the same trip, my L glass lens came through unscathed."
1,Good lens if it ever worked; watch out for Canon's horrible service,"We bought this lens twice, and both times it had the same problem with reporting Err 01 (faulty contact with the body) every few shots. None of our other lenses have ever produced this error or had this problem, and it's a well-documented problem with this lens. Canon ""repaired"" it once, but it came back with the same behavior. The second time we sent it in, they demanded that we also send in the camera body. Very bad service for a pretty expensive lens; the lens has been nothing but a cost to us. Won't buy Canon again. Avoid."
2,Stick to the L Lens,"I rented this lens and most of my images came out blurry. If I had been able to use a flash, the images may have come out better(?). So, I'm guessing that in low-light situations, where you cannot use a flash, get an L lens."
3,I REALLY did want to love this Lens (but I just can't),"Say it ain't so!I've had this lens for a couple of months now. ~Took it on my trip to the Big Apple, some family events, and a hike or two. I had such high hopes for this lens after reading all the reviews. As far as picture qualify is concerned I have no gripes but the build quality is something I cannot overlook. I'm wasnt expecting L series 'fit & finish' but my $450 Tamrom zoom feels much tighter than this lens.My biggest issue the the slack feel in the zoom. I imagine it will only get worse with use. For forking out over 1k I expected a lot more. If I am pointing my lens towards the ground, it doesnt take much for it to start sliding. Oh, and there is no lock on it either. Also the overall feel is just cheap to me, although this is a heavy lens. The focus ring feels cheap too. I'm bummed since there is no other comparable canon lens with IS near these specs. I think I will end up selling this thing used. Sorry Canon, I'm disappointed."
5,Canon EF-S 17-55mm F2.8,I bought this lens with the Canon 60D as a replacement for my 30D that outlived its useful life. The lens I use most is the 300MM L F4 for bird photography with the 1.4x extender. My every day lens was the kit lens 18-55MM F3.5-5.6 no IS and occasionally the 50MM F1.8. I read a lot about the Canon EF-S 17-55mm F/2.8 IS and believe the good reviews that say it is a luxury lens without the red stripe and weather proofing. I think the image quality is unbeatable for a lens with this range.
4,"Almost, but not L quality images","The best part of this lens is that it is stabilized and f/2.8. I can take had held shots at weddings regardless of the lighting.The downside is that it is not nearly as sharp or high quality as a L lens. It sucks a lot of dust inside which doesn't affect the pictures but could eventually be a mechanical issue. It is not sharp until around f/8 and does not handle contrast or vivid colors as well as L glass.I would recommend buying this if you need to take hand held shots with a zoom, in low light. Otherwise buy a L or a couple primes."
5,Canon lenses are great,Not a professional photographer but appreciate quality and this lens is no exception to canon's reputation for great lenses. It's a little large for the focal length range but it's very versatile with the fixed maximum aperture of 2.8. This is my go to lens for any general shooting and it has never let me down.
5,An exceptional lens!,"This lens is truly exceptional! I expected a relatively quality lens based on the numerous reviews. What I did not expect was the level of quality that parallels what I have seen from Canon L-series pro lenses. I have never seen a depth-of-field capable of being so crisp and paper thin. My initial test shots, while just playing with it out of the box, look good enough to add to a portfolio. The bottom line is that this lens is absolutely worth every penny!"
3,Review of Canon EF-S 17-55mm f/2.8 IS USM lens,"This lens did not zoom smoothly when I got it. It may have been damaged from the extremely poor packaging that Amazon used to ship it. The IS is also a bit noisy, but not too bad. The lens is very front-heavy on a Rebel XSi; it should be better on a larger camera body. This lens is significantly faster than the kit lens, but early testing with indoor shots showed no sharpness advantage."
2,Amazon Packing is Horrible,"Despite some of the warnings about Amazons packing on this lens, I went for the lowest cost and tried again (better packing with other lenses) with a new EF-S 17-55mm. The carton showed-up today. A large box, deflated airbags and my new $1000 lens in Canon's carton bounced around. I can not believe Amazon hasn't a clue on packing/shipping these lenses. Fortunately, it seems my lens is OK, but this is the last of several purchases I will make direct to Amazon.com."
4,Don't believe the hype it's ok,Overall it's a very good lens butts for the price make sure you really look before you buy these lengths I'm not upset that I bought them because I do video shooting but for that money it's not worth it it got better and cheaper lens out there that gives you the same type of quality
4,Canon EF-S 17-55mm f/2.8 IS USM Lens,"I am very pleased with this lens. Last week I took approx. 700 pictures on a trip to Iran, mainly using this lense. The IS, together with the f/2.8 makes it a very good indoor lens. I some of the museums you are not allowed to use flash; this lens is solving that problem.I believa that the softness I expire in the photos is because of my D40 camerahouse, not the lens.What I am missing:- the weather-proofing you get on the L-series- the Lens Hood should be a part of the (expensive) lens- A pouch should be a part of the (expensive) lens"
2,Dust Sucker!,"I am on my second copy of this lens. Both lenses accumulated significant dust underneath the front element within one week of owning this lens. It has a very poor feeling zoom operation. It's impossible to zoom slowly and evenly while shooting video. I love how sharp this lens is, even at 2.8, but it's inexcusable that Canon chose to not fix the problems surrounding the poor build quality for such an expensive lens. I plan on keeping this lens, because it's the best lens for a crop sensor. It pairs very well with my 60d. It's off to Canon for a cleaning after one week of owning. I plan on putting a UV filter from now on when it gets back from Canon. Last thing, its absurd that I have to spend another $50 on a lens hood because Canon won't send one with the lens. For $1,100, it should come with a lens hood. Think twice before purchasing this lens."
3,"Good for photo, awkward for video","Bought this lens for a Canon 7D with the main use being videography. I'd always been told this was a great lens, perhaps the best, with the EF-S mount. It was the ""L"" lens with the ""L"" designation.I like the lens for pictures. Great IS and USM and great with the f2.8 all the way through.However, for practical use in shooting video, not the best choice. The 17-55mm f2.8 is clunky in the zoom, and focus ring is tiny compared to L-series lenses.The lens itself produces a great picture, but without a follow focus rig then manual focus is kind a chore with this lens. And you can't get a nice steady zoom in or out with this lens either. And for my line of work, that's not acceptable.But if you're taking just pictures, or are doing home video with your T2i/550D and 7D, I think that's fine. It's a low entry on the prosumer stage. If you are a prosumer, I'd advice to continue saving and try to get a 24mm f1.4L instead."
3,"Great lens, but for video use, there are better options","Length:: 2:22 MinsI have a Canon 7D that I use for shooting video. I needed an all-purpose, wide-to-portrait type lens. This 17-55mm 2.8 fit the bill, except the bill was incredibly steep. I'm only an enthusiastic amateur semi-professional, so I'm not used to lenses costing over $1k. I've rented expensive lenses, but never had the dough to buy one until I decided to spurge on this EF-S because I read so many great reviews for it.I was disappointed. Although this lens is truly as fantastic as people say, it is NOT worth paying over $1k for it in my opinion. Now I know I'm not supposed to make a big deal about how much the item costs and should focus more on the item itself, but you just cannot detach this lens from it's price point when you are considering to buy it.Bottom line: unless you got money to burn, don't get this lens."

3,The Clown,"The book was in ok shape but very old looking. But then again, it was priced appropriately. Arrived very quickly."
3,An OK-Book,I sure do agree that Boell is a witty author. Yet I believe that the characterizations in this entertainig novel are constructed somewhat too weak to leave a remaining impression and render it more absorbing.
4,When Germany felt remorse,"Heinrich Boell's ""Ansichten eines Clowns"" is a fresco of postwar Germany, a very different landscape than today's. Boell's generation were tortured by remorse - and justly so; remorse humanized them. This is a novel about pain, loss and ethics: individual ethics and collective ethics; about how Hans remains faithful to his beliefs to the bitter end, about how Marie takes the path that she has to take. Together with Guenter Grass's ""The Tin Drum"" (published four years earlier), the ""Clown"" is the greatest novel of the Erhard period."
4,Delightful,As a layperson I cannot comment on the accuracy of the translation but it reads elegantly and the ethos and sometimes pathos of the writers are blatantly palpable. They can be read aloud easily as they most certainly were intended for such a purpose. Two of the writers (Clement of Alexandria and Ignatius of Antioch) quite likely had direct contact with the original Apostles. The Didache may predate the gospels. In any case this collection gives a good glimpse of Christianity at its very early form. Essential reading indeed.
3,Hyenas don't Change Sex,"The Epistle of Barnabas sounds all cool -- explaining all the old testament types and shadows -- but when it gets to the food laws starts talking about how Hyenas change sex, and Hare's grow a new ""orifice"" every year, and babies eat honey when their first born --I checked all these things with Google and none of it is true.I'm a Christian and thought I could learn cool interpretations of hard passages from the Old Testament but with this kind of wrong information in the explanation -- as cool and religious as it sounds -- Barnabas would appear to have been high on crack when he wrote his epistle -- if it really is his epistle which I doubt.Close but no Cigar."
4,Good Introduction to the Apostolic Fathers,"Very good introduction to the writings of the apostolic fathers. However, I feel it was a major oversight for the author and/or publisher not to include the Epistle of Barnabus and Shepherd of Hermas in the book since these two documents are crucial to the study of early church literature. Apart from this obvious mistake, a very good book."
3,Another Omission,"A couple of reviewers mentioned the omission of Hermas and Papias in this edition. The editor also has omitted the so-called Second Epistle of Clement - not by Clement but still recognized as the oldest Chirstian sermon we have - apart from the Homily to the Hebrews, of course (Heb. 13:22).Omissions like these are sad because the books omiited were key documents that influenced the Fathers (esp. Hermas and Papias). 2Clement also preserves some interesting ""agrapha"" - sayings of Jesus not written in the canonical Gospels.Why were these omitted? It is a short book that would not have been greatly enlarged (less than 100 pages) by the addition of these three works that are always included in other editions of the Apostolic Fathers."
3,Acceptable,"Soap Pump matches my sink fixtures perfectly. Over the last couple of months, I've noticed small rust spots starting to form. So much for stainless..."
2,"Remington Tstudio Straightener, 3/4"" Curved Plate","This is the third Remington flat iron I've purchased. I love the other two and looked forward to the enhancement of the curve on this one, but I was sorely disappointed when I found that the edge of the plates snag, catch and pull my hair. I can't afford to lose any more hair, so I rarely use this flat iron. I do recommend the Remington Wet 2 Straight 2"" Wide Plate Wet/Dry Ceramic Hair Straightening Iron with Tourmaline and the Remington S6500 Sleek and Curl Ceramic Pearl Multi-styler Hair Straightener, 1 Inch, but not this one."
3,Nothing bad but not the best,"I've been a fan of Freda's since the Band of Gold days and enjoy everything she's done. This album is okay. I believe when it was recorded she just about had it with Invictus. The standouts here are We've Gotta Find A Way Back to Love, Mood for Love (both have alot of energy going on), and Right Back Where I First Started From(similar to Deeper & Deeper) and the beautiful ballad For No Reason. Her cover of the Carpenters Rainy Days and Mondays is purely magnificent. While her vocals are outstanding on her version of If You Go Away, the arrangement could have been better. Great art work of Freda on the cover!"
1,"Don't bother, messes w/ the power to the keyboard","I liked this case when I first got it. It fit the phone perfectly, did not add any extra bulk and provided some protection. Quickly ran into problems. It presses on something b/c the phone lost all function to the keyboard and camera section of the phone. I could still use the top section hence the phone still worked. It required a reboot and that seemed to correct the problem but it required it up to 5 times in one day. Another office mate ran into the same problem. I would send it back but lost the receipt now it sits in a basket of other worthless junk."
2,Doesn't take a likin' and keep on tickin'....,I liked mine at first but it didn't hold up. I've had mine about a month and it's falling apart. It's too bad because I really liked it.As far as the comments from others regarding the phone freezing on when it's open it's the 2 bottons (contacts and message). I found that if you trim the plastic around those bottons that fixes that issue.
1,Cheap,"The headset is cheap. The kind you will find at a dollar store. The cell carrying case is also cheap and too tight, I could not use it. Basically you are getting a car charger."
5,"""For Such A Time As This""","This second book in the 'Great Lives' series is excellent! As a Pastor, I used this book for a small group Bible study. We studied one chapter a week. What strength we all can receive from studing the life of Esther! Here was a woman who had to make a decision to be silent and let her people die, or to stand up and do whats right. It's extremely interesting that God is never mentioned anywhere in the Book of Esther, but as Charles Swindoll points out, He is working ""behind the scenes"" in all of the lives involved in this powerful book. Use this book as a study guide with the Book of Esther."
1,More speculations than Truth,"In reading this book I was disappointed to find that the points Charles Swindoll makes are based more on speculation and inferences upon inferences than actual Biblical truth. I actually could not finish reading this book as I couldn't find the value in this. I prefer to learn about the life of Esther from what the Bible presents, not how the author thinks Esther might have felt and then how she might have responded from that."
2,I'm not sure how to comment on it!,"I would like for Mr. Swindoll to know that he has wrong information in his book. He has that Esther was the neice of Mordecai. That statement is incorrect! Esther was not his neice but his cousin. Read the scripture found in Esther chapter number #2 and verse number 15. ( Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, was come to go unto the king, she required nothing but what Hegai the king's chamberlain, the keeper of the women, appointed."
5,BEST BOOK EVER!!!!,"This book sits right next to my Bible. A MUST READ for any woman who is going through difficult times, or wants to fulfill her inner modern-day TOWANDA. (fried green tomatoes)Esther: A Woman of Strength and Dignity (Great Lives Series)"
4,One of the most thougtful accounts of Esther,"Swindoll is always a gifted writer giving special insight to the reader. ""Esther"" brings to life the struggles and emotions one faces in life's difficult situations. Esther reflects poise, strength and courage in the midst of trials. This is an encouraging and one the most thoughtful accounts of Esther that I have read."
2,Book received defective with knife cut through entire book,I was upset to find that while this book was listed as NEW - it had a cut through the entire book as though someone had taken a knife to the book. Certainly should not have been sold in this condition - and definitely should have been noted as defective.
3,Good presentation of one woman's voice speaking for God.,A well written account of the grace and strength of one woman's voice in the service of God and her fellow Hebrews. Some positive advice about living a good and happy life inside of God's grace. Excellent presentation of what a woman's special gifts as a person and child of God are. Uplifting. An integral part of Jewish history.
4,New condition? No.,"Having ordered this book as ""new condition"" I was disappointed when it was delivered and all the corners were slightly bent. I don't mind that it was only slightly damaged. I do mind however that it was advertised as ""new."""
5,The best basic review book I've used.,"I've used this text book to hone and review my basic math skills. It happened to also be a good review and reference book for the GMAT exam if you have the extra time to study.If you do all of the section excercise problems you can really become good at all of the individual topics.It's also a good book if you're weak at certain basic math skills such as decimal conversion to fractions, square roots, reducing fractions, exponents and radicals, polynomials, solving quadtratic equations by factoring and other basics."
4,Great but better to use for girls than for boys,"This is a much needed tool for potty training! The only thing we would change is the ""potty guard"". It should be higher so that it covers the private parts on little boys. Sometimes we end up with a mess."
4,NYCMom,This is working great for us. So far she's pee'ed (spelling?) a few times and does not feel uncomfortable sitting here. Definitely a great product.
3,Too many overspray accidents,"I bought this based on researching other reviews & products. This was the only product I could find without all the bells & whistles and distractions offered by most other products. It is a simple potty & was the most like mommy & daddy's. While the potty is easy to use, my 2 yr old son pees on the floor almost everytime when using it. If he's not positioned just right, he goes over the top or to the side of the guard. We have stopped using the potty after a couple of weeks & switched to the babybjorn toilet seat. My son likes going on the big potty better & there have been almost no overspray accidents with it as compared to nearly 100% of the time with the potty chair. As an added bonus, there is no clean up with a potty seat."
5,Trained,I had been defecating and urinating in my diaper for I don't know how long. It had become a minor embarrassment as my friend Sam abandoned this nasty habit and moved on to the use of underwear and the toilet. Mama and Papa were expressing some disappointment and confusion as I alternately soiled my new drawers. The bulkiness of the diaper was interfering with my new-found attraction to sleek-fitting garments and a more carefree lifestyle.Bonus: I am working this urine/feces for candy thing like a Wall Street trader on steroids.---as related to me by HFW
3,bad design,this is my first time writing a review but felt I should put my experience out there. I bought this potty chair bc it looked nice and seemed like it would serve its purpose well. But after heavy use for a week I found that it sticks to my daughters thighs and one time stuck hard enough that when she got up the cup toppled over spilling pee everywhere. Nasty to clean up. otherwise it is easy to use and empty but the sticking was annoying enough that I am now looking for a new seat for her to use
3,Not bad but not perfect,"Our 21 month old uses this potty all day long. She was potty trained early and seems to like it pretty well. I bought it b/c of all the great reviews! The only problem she has with this potty is that it pinches her when she sits on it wrong. The bucket part would come up a bit if she moved around and that's when she would get pinched. It's happened a few times. It pinched her finger as she was sitting down and then it happened to her little leg. That's the only issue I really have with it and that's why I'd give it 3 stars. Before that, I had no complaints."
5,Fabulous potty chair,"I love this potty. The only problem with it is that I only ordered one! I have twin boys who are 15 months, and after purchasing this potty, I realized I needed 2. I went and bought a different brand at a local store and did not like it. The splash guard made it uncomfortable for my boys to sit on and the seat was so small I didn't think they could go 1 and 2. I took it back and got a another brand and still was not happy. I will be purchasing at least one more. This potty is perfect for my boys!"
5,nice potty chair for larger toddler!,"i have read several of the reviews for this potty chair, both good and bad, and i have to agree it is a great potty chair! great size for a larger toddler. my son is 36 inches tall and 40lbs and finding a potty chair that is big enough and sturdy enough has been a challenge. this one fits him great with room to spare. it also has a large opening so no worries of him missing and making a mess. i also saw some bad reviews where they had problems with the pee guard and pee going over it onto the child's leg and floor. so far i haven't had that problem. i just tell my son to make sure it is pointed down, which needs to be taught to little boys when potty training anyways. also having the options to pick a color made the experience much easier and my son loved the moment it was delivered and was able to open it and see the color he picked. overall this has made potty training a great experience!"
4,Potty Pal,"My son is just getting started, but he is now wanting to sit on the potty with clothes on about 5 times a day and today he did when he first woke up. The base is nice because it has a grip and does not slide easily. I like the pull out cup too. We got white so it will be the same as everybody and maybe he will feel he is doing the same thing as everyone else. I DO reccommend this potty."
2,Uncomfortable!,"I bought this potty because I wanted something simple with not too many thrills, but I am disappointed. This potty is very uncomfortable for my daughter. She sits only a few minutes and then she starts complaining that it hurts and when she stands up, she has lots of big red marks. I think it is also small for her, even though she is not a very big girl. Anyway I am getting rid of it and getting something better. Maybe with some kids might work, but I don't feel to recommend it."
1,Pee Everywhere!,"I bought this potty because it had the best reviews, but almost every time my 2-year-old son uses it, he pees all over the floor instead. I've tried every position - from putting him way at the back to putting him right up close to it so the shield will ""hold"" his penis down - no luck! I actually think it hinders the process since my son freaks when he pees all over himself and the floor. In addition, we have a marble bathroom floor and I worry it's staining/etching the marble. I'm throwing it in the dumpster and purchasing a new one!!"
4,Seems like it will work,"I have a 14 month old. He sits on it. He doesn't scream. he's not using it as a potty yet. He climbs on it and listens to his echo while putting his face into it. Seems comfortable, will be easy to clean, not to big and akward. I'm sure it will do the job"
4,Good quality and price,"I wanted a chair with a removable bowl, but now that I've seen my son grab it and attempt to dump it out, part of me wishes I'd have gone for a toilet adapter style.If this is the style you want though, it's durable and sleek in appearance (for a potty chair, anyway).ETA: OK, now I'm glad that the bowl is removable as we're using it more, but you do have to watch for spills. It cleans easily and my son finds it comfortable."
1,Not impressed!,"I bought this potty after reading the reviews thinking this sounded like a great potty chair. I am not happy with it at all. My son is 30 lbs and almost 3 feet tall at not quite 2 years old. The potty seat is too small, it leaves a red ring on his bottom and when he stands up, it sticks to him. However, that's not the worst part. My son is afraid to sit on it by himself because he's accidentally sat on the splash guard and poked himself more than once. Also when he pees it goes up the splash guard and right out of the potty. There's more pee on the floor than in the potty. My son freaked out the first time it happened because he had pee all over him. I would not buy this potty seat for boys especially larger ones."
4,Concerned about size...,"My son is now 2 years 8 months, and we started out potty training on the green frog. It's known as ""ribbit"". Well ""ribbit"" wasn't very deep, and didn't have any type of rubber gripping on the bottom of it. He seemed to be getting way too big for it. So my biggest concern was depth, and height of the back. I still wanted him to feel safe, but not pee pee over the edge. I am very pleased with the depth of this one. It fits him really good now. I'm a little worried about it fitting for the next 3 months, but we're working on it and I hope that he is potty trained in the next few months. I like the bottom of this Baby Bjorn because it does have rubber edging all along the bottom edge so it doesn't slide around the bathroom. It also has a really good front potty blocker. I would especially recommend this for parents with boys."
4,Other reviews are right,"My kids love this potty, but it does leave a red mark. It doesn't seem to bother them and it goes away rather quickly. They like this potty better than sitting on the big potty."
3,Potty Chair,This chair seems all right but we haven't done anything but sit on it with clothes on. I think I would probably buy a potty chair with a cushion next time so my baby's rear end didn't get cold but it works for the intended purpose.
4,like it but be careful!,"i returned a different potty same day to purchase this one. the other potty seemed more comfortable with a cushion seat but my daughter slid off the back side and seemed like if she went in it she would squirt out the front. this potty chair she could lounge in comfortably without me thinking she's going to fall off the back, i thought it would be hard but she enjoyed looking at a book on it. the only issue i had was she got excited and tried to get off of it by herself and hit the front guard, flipping over and going facefirst into our bathroom shelving. at first glace we thought she broke her nose right across the bridge. luckily she isn't scared of the potty and her nose is ok....i'm sure as she grows a little she will be able to get off easier but just a warning, i do love this potty a lot better than the first one we got."
2,Too hard,"My daughter has 2 of these potty chairs and one of another brand. She refuses to sit on these chairs the majority of the time and in the off chance she does use them, she has a bright red ring around her bottom when she gets up. Generally she gets up out of discomfort, not having finished using the potty. If anything, these potty chairs have been more harm than good in potty training for her."
5,This potty is great!,"I wanted a potty that my daughter would feel secure and comfortable in so that she could actually focus on the reason why we were having her sit on the potty to begin with! This potty was perfect! I love the high back and sides. The seat comes out and is so easy to clean! I also appreciate the rubber around the bottom that keeps it from sliding on the tile floor. She can easily get on and off of the potty without it tipping too, which is a comfort to me! The only ""complaint"" I would have is that it is hard to hear when she pees (which I listen for because I'm trying to praise and reinforce this). I don't know that a singing potty would have really been a good thing for my daughter, but I think it would have been a helpful cue for me! :)"
5,Great boy potty!,"This is the best potty for boys. My son rarely pee's out of it and the splash guard in built in and comfortable. He loves this little potty! The only downfall is having to clean the insert, but that would be the same with any potty that doesn't attach to the toilet."
1,Bad for Boys,"I bought it because of the wonderful reviews, but am very disappointed. I've had messy experiences every single time my son uses the seat. Even with sitting back as far as he can go, leaning slightly forward, aiming his pee-pee down, the pee goes up the splash guard onto his inner thighs, down the front of the seat and onto the floor. We've only been using it for three days so far but I have had to clean my son up, myself, the potty seat, and the floor every single time. I know potty training is daunting, but with these messes, diapers were way easier! I'm going back to the simple potty ring on the big toilet now."
1,Gross,This potty chair is terrible. Small and unstable. Use this only if you want to have more pee on the floor than in the pot-the splash guard acts more as a projectile ramp for pee than a guard. it is difficult to clean and the plastic seems to absorb bathroom smells (gross). I would recommend just getting a mini-toilet seat and putting your kid up on a regular toilet.
3,Not for boys who stand,"If your son has learned to stand up to go 'peepee', then be prepared for clean up beneath the potty, EVERY TIME he has to go. Sure, you can teach your son to aim at a sticker or some other object at the bottom of this potty, but if he is in a rush, or I'm not with him every time he has gone, then he'll shoot towards the back of this potty, which then leaks out from the detached piece. It is a great potty, but I wish I just taught him to go in the big potty from the beginning."
3,Not the best for girls,I bought this for my daughter and she has had so much trouble using it that it just collected dust. The splash guard in front is much to high and she is not able to sit in comfort.
2,Rough on child's bottom,I bought this potty chair after reading reviews on many potty chairs. My daughter had red marks on her bottom after sitting on it. The seat is hard and rough. Sadly disappointed by this babybjorn product.
4,My Daught likes it.,"She's still being potty trained, but she likes to sit on the chair. Easy to clean. The only draw back is that she can play with the removable bowl. She takes it out. It's simple."
3,no lid,"I bought this product but ended up sending it back because it didn't have a lid. My son loves saying ""bye,bye pee pee"" and shuting the lid so this wasn't the one for him. I ended up buying the primo seat which is a multi-use seat. The seat comes out and can go on the big toilet, it has handles and you can use the potty for a stool. My son uses it to brush his teeth and to get up to the big potty."
2,not for standing boys! or boys at all!,"this potty came highly recommended and its pretty well made FOR GIRLS. however my son never sites for peepee, the pee goes between the removable part and the chair and ends up on the floor under the chair! when he sits down to make #2 his pee goes all over the place since the peepee ""high"" part is not high enough. if you have a girl this should not be a problem but if your boy is just starting to to go to the potty and you dont know if he will be standing or sitting, I WOULD NOT GO WITH THIS POTTY!!!!"
4,got it righ tthe first time.,"My son was 17 months old when I ordered/recieved this item. He was just getting interested in the potty and trying to take his clothes off. When I got the package he was right there and he tried it out right away. he fits perfectly on it, but it is a little ackward for a beiginer. Now a month latter he is seasoned at sitting down on it and getting back up. He is almost potty trained and I am convinced it is because of this potty chair."
5,Potty go Lightly,"My daughter has been using this since her tenth month. Although the potty offers no frills: no loud colors, extra thingamajiggys around but it makes her sit in her potty comfortably until she has done her business. She is now in her 37th month and this potty endures her daily output everyday. Since the design itself is so simple, the whole thing is easily washable when you have little accidents. She sits there for full 20-30 minutes at a time and there is nothing there to pinch her chubby legs or make her back uncomfortable when she chooses to lean. My baby will sometimes take her own by-products and dump it herself (she thinks it's fun). I have not gone wrong with any of the baby bjorn products. The shipment of this one was little delayed but amazon responded by sending another one immediately upon my complaint. Thank you. Your product has made potty-training much more manageable (it was actually the offer of using panties when you become a big girl that really got her motivated)"
5,great,Our son who hasn't actually used this potty yet does love to sit on it and he also loves to move it around. We love that is it has a simple bowl for the pee and that the pee guard doesn't come off. With its ease of cleaning and easy to move design we would easily recommend this potty to anyone.
3,I Had to Buy a Second One Because My Twins Fought Over the Right to Sit on it,"I think what makes this potty work well for my twins is the high arms. They like to sit on it and started the day it arrived. Also, it arrived in one day. But they fought over the right to sit on it and I was made to buy a second one. I have them in white and blue.There is something about this potty that makes a little one understand its purpose. I couldn't believe how comfortable they are for them sitting on it, due to the arms and back and overall design. I think the price was favorable and feel great about the purchase of these two potty chairs.They're right now in the early stages of learning. We'll be using these for awhile I expect."
3,Leaky for boys!,I bought this in preparation for my son's potty training and unfortunately it didn't work out for us due to the fact that he preferred to pee standing up. When he does this it hits the back of the chair and goes underneath the lip of the removable piece. This caused a lot of really messy pee rivers and lakes on my bathroom floor. I would not recommend buying this for the boys that you know are going to go potty standing up. It would be great for girls though. The base seemed very stable and not tippy and the seating area was smooth and shouldn't pinch.
2,Not for bigger kids,"I got this potty because I found it the most simple and aesthetically pleasing. While my daughter used it at first for a few days, she has since complained about the seam between the ""bowl"" and the ""chair"" (She points to the seam along the back of the chair, wiggles the bowl, says ""back and forth . . . don't like. . .owwie"".) As a 30 lb. 2 year old, she's on the big side and I think that this chair is just uncomfortable for her. She actually now refuses to use it and has asked me for a ""new potty"""
5,What a great product!,My two year old loves this chair. We are just practicing sitting on it right now. It fits her well and it's easy for her to get on and off it. It doesn't slide around on the floor and she seems to be comfortable while using it.
5,BabyBjorn Potty Chair,"GREAT POTTY CHAIR. The built in splash guard is so nice for little boys, but this chair is fine for girls as well. Reviews I read before I ordered the BabyBjorn potty chair remarked how well the BabyBjorn suited larger toddlers. My 2 1/2 year old grandson is very small for his age and this potty chair is a fine size for him, too. His feet reach the floor comfortably when he is sitting on it. The removable oval bowl design is a great feature, as it allows more room for the child to sit comfortably and ""complete their business"". The bowl is also easy to empty. I highly recommend the BabyBjorn potty chair."
2,"Nice design, but needs more bum cheek room","We had been struggling with getting our 3 1/2 yr old to want to try and potty. I looked at all the potty chairs possible and read reviews and this one sounded perfect. So I got my boy excited about this one and let him pick the color out. He was so excited when it came and wanted to sit on it right away (this is what I was hoping for when I bought it) he probably wasn't on it more then 10 seconds and said it hurt his bum. We tried several more times and same thing. He is an average size toddler so I am not sure what size of kid this would be comfortable for. I ended up getting next the babybjorn toilet trainer and it is awesome. He loves it, it doesn't hurt him and the splash guard is great for a little boy."
3,Seems uncomfortable,"I love the back to this seat and the splashguard for my little man, but he is very uncomfortable in this seat. In fact, he holds onto the sides with this arms straight so he can hold himself up off of the seat. I assume this means that the seat digs into this bottom and could use more cushioning. Since we're just starting to potty train, I want to encourage him to want to sit on the potty, so this is not working for us. Continuing to shop around."
2,Great if you have a girl,"I'm really surprised at the 5 star reviews for this potty chair. If I had back all the time I have spent cleaning pee up off the floor I would be so happy. The splash guard is way too short, my son just pees right over the top of it. I do like the separate potty and it's easy to clean but I still have to clean the whole chair because it simply doesn't hold in the pee stream. Ugh. I'm retiring it as soon as I get a different potty chair. MESSY."
5,Great potty especially for boys,"This is the fourth style of potty we tried and the first one without a major problem. As others have noted this is especially good for boys. If you have a boy, don't waste your time on the other choices. This wins easily."
5,LOVE IT good for boys!!!!,"It is very simple...but really comfortable, this is our second potty and I bought it for our second bathroom, my son feels so comfortable and safe that I moved it to his bathroom, putting the Fisher price Elmo potty in our guess room...the cleaning it is great and my almost 3 year old can do it by him self...As a suggestion don't go for the potties with too much paraphernalia choose a simple design one you won't regret...."
5,Great for boys!,"This is a great potty chair! It is simple, easy to clean, and nice looking for a potty. Contains messes well, even with a boy."
2,Too hard for my son's bottom,"I bought this after reading many reviews for different products. I am disappointed because my son cannot sit on it for more than a few minutes without complaining that his bottom hurts. When he gets up his bottom is completely red. If he gets on, does his business quickly and gets off there is no issue but anytime he needs to linger on the potty he becomes very uncomfortable. I am now looking for a softer seat to set on the bathroom toilet."
3,son doesn't like it,"I was excited about this potty - very stylish, simple, cute. However, my son refuses to use it. He pushes it all over the house as if it were a car. He will only use the ""big potty."""
1,Not for Boys that Stand Up,"Great when my son was sitting down... now that he stands... junk. If not right on target, you're going to have a mess every time. Think pee puddle under the chair... and now imagine the smell. Totally gross, and getting rid of ASAP.Skip."
5,Perfect Potty,"Bought this training potty to start introducing our 16 month old daughter to the potty. She loves this little pink seat and took right to it. It's easy to clean and easy for her to use. The little bump in the front of the seat can be a little tricky for her but other than that, we are really happy with it!"
5,Great product!,"I highly recommend this product!It did meet all my expectations!Easy to clean,sturdy,comfy and most of all my daughter loooves it!As soon as I put her in it ,she knew what it was for, rather than those other ones with all the bells and wistles that just distract them! Great product"
5,user friendly,we just started potty training and are doing great on this potty. very smart design can remove the middle and wash it seperately.
5,Toddler True,"This was my second purchase of a BabyBjorn potty chair. I had bought my daughter one when she began potty training my 2 year old grandson, but not one for my home. I was using a potty insert and a stool and found little Ben was having trouble getting on. I asked how the BabyBjorn was working and she told me he uses it only. She was so right, I am so happy to have purchased this; mine is blue and her's is red. He loves it; it is sturdy, easy to clean, and does not move when he sits down or gets up.Wonderful item and I highly recommend for the daunting task of potty training! I plan on this being my number #1 baby shower gift from now on!"
3,"functional, but not comfortable","It functions. If my 2 year old boy pees in it the spray is minimal, the rubber pads keep it from sleeping, and its easy to clean. However he hates the potty. The seat sticks to his butt and is made of hard plastic so is very uncomfortable. He will perch above the seat using his arms to hold him off the seat rather then sit on it. I have since gotten the boon one and it is much more comfortable and he sits on it much better."
2,Splash Guard for Girls?,I LOVED the design of this potty when I saw it at the store. It only has 2 parts which would make it easy to clean. I loved the solid color because I thought we could decorate it with stickers when we used the potty correctly. It seemed perfect until I brought it home and showed it to my daughter. This potty has a built in splash guard that is not removable. My daughter has a difficult time sitting on this potty because of the splash guard. She tries to sit to the side to avoid sitting on the bump in the middle. We've been practicing sitting on it for several weeks now and she just doesn't seem comfortable with it. I'm so disappointed because this potty seemed perfect but I think we're going to have to find something different.
3,Better for Boys or Older Toddlers,"Pros: Super-sturdy, easy to clean, attractive (for a potty)Cons: Splash guard on front is not necessary for girls, and can be troublesome for younger potty trainers. My daughter (a fairly young trainer) has a tough time navigating that splash guard on her own; she usually needs help to sit down properly on this potty.Overall: Probably 5 stars if you have a boy or a potty trainer who is older than 2. If you have a girl, especially under 2 or small for her age, you might want to try other options."
5,Great Chair,"I have this for my almost 3 year old son who is around 30lbs and very tall. He loves this seat. He fits in it just fine, we have had no trouble with leaks, and he finds it very easy to use on his own. The potty is very easy to clean, and we have never had a problem with pee getting everywhere. The one thing I would change is that sometimes the removable seat does get stuck to his thighs when he stands, but he's learned to be careful, and we've never had an accident due to that. Otherwise, great potty training seat!"
1,"too small,not good for boys",we bought this one for my son who is 3. it is too small for him. the pee comes right over the pee guard. they should have made the pee guard a little bigger and the seat bigger too. my son weighs about 39 lbs.
5,"Good potty, especially for a boy","We tried another potty first, but we had a problem with pee not being kept in the bow because the lip at the front was not high enough. So far no problems with this one. Our son loves it."
4,So Far It's Working....,"I bought this for my granddaughter as she is starting to show an interest in getting those diapers off. She likes it. It wasn't boring or scary. Which is one reason why I decided on this chair, bright colors are more interesting to a tot. She has been sitting on it. But we aren't at the take off the diaper stage yet. I do think this will be perfect for her!"
5,perfect first potty,"I keep this potty as a spare in our master bath (we have other potty seats by Bjorn). My son loves this potty, and so do I. The simple design makes it easy to clean and use. Ive learned my lesson with the cheaper potties made of thin plastic. I returned every one of them and purchased all Bjorn products. I love how sturdy their designs are."
1,Not made for boys,BabyBjörn Potty Chair - BlueMy baby is 12 months and 24lbs. The splash card is not even close to being tall enough to work. Seat is also small. He just fits with no room to spare. Very disappointed
5,Great potty,We love this cute little potty. My son loves it too. I really like the front part that comes up slightly for boys and its easy to clean as well.
1,Uncomfortable for my daughter,"I'm surprised this potty got such rave reviews. My daughter is so uncomfortable with this potty trainer! She'll sit on it, but it's so small. The splash guard is what really seems to make it uncomfortable for her. She's accidental sat on it before and it hurt her. When she sits on it the splash guard makes her have to sit with her legs open, but as I mentioned the seat is pretty narrow so she can't really sit on it comfortably."
4,Works Great for Little Boys,"When I began my research for a potty chair for my son, I had no idea how many things there were to consider! I really didn't want anything that made noise or had lights but we ultimately decided on this chair because of the one-piece splash guard since I learned that it wasn't uncommon for little boys to hurt their tender bits on other chairs. It is well-made and sturdy; it didn't tip when my son got on or off. I think the main thing it did was to give my son the confidence to use a potty - his feet stayed securely on the ground and it was stable and didn't slip around. He had no problem getting himself on and off of it and he liked the 'responsibility' of dumping the contents into the big potty (I liked that it was easy for him to do that, and easy for me to clean the bowl afterward)."
4,"Frustrating, but a great size","My 2.5 year old is a big kid, 40 lbs, 38"" tall. He needs a bigger potty chair, which this is. We have the smaller baby bjorn potty we were using but he can't keep his pee in it, he's just too big. I like that the potty cup comes out to wash, but it often sticks to his bottom as he stands up from it. We've had urine on the floor several times just because of this. I ask him to hold the white cup down when he stands up, he just gets over excited when he goes and stands up right away to look inside. He sat on one at a friends house that had a cover over the removable cup, which is by far a better design, but the high back on this one makes a nice spot for spending extended amounts of time on it as he reads and tries to go. All in all, I like it and would recommend it with reservations."
2,Not comfortable...,"While this chair works fine, it's just not comfortable. My son's little bottom is so red after just sitting on it for a short time! He ends up either standing for some relief or moving around the chair in an attempt to find a comfortable position. If I had to do it over again, I would buy something with a cushy seat. Wouldn't buy this one again..."
3,Helps the potty training,"This helped our kid potty train faster, it really came down to going to the bathroom at specific intervals in the end but this did help although it wasn't a must have."
5,sturdy and easy to clean,"my son loved this, it was sturdy, easy to clean, great 'splash"" protection in the front, i would highly recommend this to anyone who is potty training their kids, great for boys and girls!"
5,Great potty seat!,Great purchase! My son loves this seat. The splash guard is high enough for little boys who are learning to stay seated the entire potty experience. ;) The bowl in the middle is easy to remove and clean. I would definitely recommend this potty to any of my friends.
5,Great Potty,"My little girls likes using this over the other potty that we got, personally i think it works better than other, cheaper ones, i like the hard seat so she doesnt want to sit there forever, and it forces her to get in the proper ""position"" which she doesnt always achieve the other potty."
5,amazing toddler trains herself!!,I bought this product too early for my baby to use but now that she is 2 she is teaching herself to potty. I have this in the restroom and when my child would see me use the toilet she decided she wanted to use her babybjorn potty and she actually is in the process of training herself. For now she only pees in it and she even empties it out by herself in the toilet and she is 2 years old. This product is cool she sits on it she does not fall in she fits perfectly even tough she is petite. It does not tip over its perfect. I love this babybjorn it is awesome there are no cons to this product.
2,"Maybe good for some, but not my 28 mo old boy","I bought this potty chair thinking it would be a great solution for us, but the splash guard splashes everywhere. My son is 28 mos old and it is just not shaped right for his body. It is great for cleaning and seems comfortable for him, but he is peeing everywhere! So, I am constantly cleaning the floor and he gets upset because he is getting wet everytime he pottys making potty training nearly impossible. FYI he does the same thing with the fisher price musical potty and the potty rings you put on the toilet. I would love a solution that works for us!"
5,Great simple product.,Baby Bjorn consistently combines great design with simple products. No bells or whistles but it does the job. I would greatly recommend this product; my daughter loves it and got motivated to start potty training.
2,much clean up,This potty is good if your child sits still and doesn't move and if its a boy can aim perfectly. We have to clean up the potty whole seat inside and out ( not just the removable parts the seat underside and all) along with the floor at every potty time.
2,Uncomfortable!,"I used this with my son, and it served it's purpose. The only problem is that its really uncomfortable. He complained about it, and my daughter absolutely refuses to sit on it for more than a second and complains that it hurts as well. So while this may be a good product, it just doesn't work for my children. If you want something comfortable on the heiny, this is not the one. Back to the drawing board..."
3,Not for Boys,"Although this potty did get my son interested in using the potty for a short time(because it was something new) the pee guard for boys does not really protect any accidents from spilling over, it is just a raised flat piece but I think it would be better if it had a lip to help keep the pee in the toilet. It is made nicely that is why I did give it a 3 star rating but I just would not recommend to any of my friends with sons."
5,Great potty chair,This potty chair is great but a little pricey. Easy to clean and no complaints from my son regarding comfort. Overall a great chair for the beginners.
4,Nice But some issues,"The Babybjorn Potty Chair has many nice features. Easy to clean--supports child, compact sturdy and simple. BUT if your child is small (like mine) the guard on the front is cumbersome. My child can't not mount the potty himself and must be placed on the potty. When he tries to get on the potty he has hurt himself in ways that makes any male member of the household wince."
2,Splash guard too high for a girl,"We started with this potty earlier than the recommended 24 months and our daughter was too short for the splash guard and it would poke her in the bum whenever she tried to sit down. She is now almost 24 months (as recommended by the manufacturer) and it's still a pain. In addition, the seat tips easily when she's trying to lower herself on and slides around all over the tile (bathroom) floor when she's getting on and off. A waste of plastic for our shortish, chubby-thighed girl."
4,Bjorn potty chair,"has a larger ""drop"" opening than a convertible potty that fits onto a toilet seat and step; better chance of your child pooping into the potty as opposed to pooping on the rear of the sitting area. However, the sitting area on the rear is also wide. If your child sits all the way back, there's a chance he/she can poop on the seat."
4,One good potty,"This potty is the best. My daughter can fit on it easily unlike her previous potty. It's not the most attractive potty, very simple/plain. Overall it serves it's purpose."
2,Not great for big kids,"I bought this because of the excellent reviews, so I felt it necessary to add my review that is not as positive.My son is 3'3"" & 30 pounds. (he is almost 3 yr old) He does fit on this potty, but it leaves horrible red marks in his inner thighs after only sitting on it a few minutes. It hurt his bottom so badly that he cried & said ""oh mommy my legs!"" It's not great to start potty training with a painful experience. He is now afraid of it.I don't know if my son just has very sensitive skin or if it's because he is too big for the chair, but I switched to a soft seat that goes on the big toilet & we are trying that now. I wouldn't recommend this potty for larger children."
3,Daughter Doesn't Like the Bowl,"My daughter is only starting potty training, but she doesn't like the bowl of this potty. I'm not sure why, only that she takes the bowl out of the seat before sitting down. She's ok if I put the bowl underneath the seat so that she doesn't go all over the floor, but for some reason she doesn't like to sit on it the way it's designed."
5,SO glad i bought this one and not the cheaper ones,"We just bought this seat today and I am already soooo glad that I bought this one and not one of the other cheaper models I was looking at. The other models may have been cheaper but they were much more complicated, having three seperate parts to make keeping it clean quite a challenge. The BabyBjorn has only two pieces and the whole thing is a nice, shiney clean looking white. My daughter is comfortable when sitting on it and she gets on and off of it with no danger of tipping. I am so pleased with this chair. And if you are like I was and having a hard time spending $22.00 on a potty chair when there is another available for $12.99, give yourself some perspective: how much are you spending on diapers EVERY WEEK??? I think this chair will be our family's ticket to waving goodbye to the diaper portion of the weekly grocery bill =)"
3,All Wet,"Our floors end up all wet half the time my 2 year old pees in this potty - the front part isn't sufficient blockage. We've had better luck with the Fisher Price froggy potty, which is also $10 less and contains the same general ease of convenience."
2,Hard seat,I just bought this potty seat and my son will not sit in it more than 5 minutes. He complains that it hurts his back and bum.
2,Not a good potty for boys..,"Although many people have given this high reviews, I simply do noy like this potty. Everytime my son sits down to pee it sprays everywhere, even when he ""aims"" it down. The splash guard is simply not high enough, it should also be made of softer material so he doesn't hurt himself when sitting down."
3,it hurts my 2 yr olds bum.,"love the high back and easily accessible to dump and clean. the front is skinny enough for him to sit with his feet positioned nicely. what i dont like is my little one keeps saying his bum hurts and doesnt like to sit on it. when he sits for more than a few seconds and gets up, he has a red mark where the plastic touches his bum. he opts for the real toliet, even though it is awkward for himto sit."
4,If your son STANDS up to potty...,"This IS a great potty. Easy to clean and simple in design, HOWEVER, if your son has learned to stand up to pee, then be prepared for messes and spills over the bowl and under the bowl to clean up. Of course, we are teaching him to aim in the bottom of the bowl, but in the meantime, we continue to clean up under the bowl because he aims toward the backside of the potty, which then leaks underneath the top piece and onto the floor.I still give it 4 stars because of the simple design, and I love that you just lift the top part and clean/empty it. I would've gotten their one piece smaller potty, however, my son is 2 1/2 and a big boy, so I wasn't sure if he would fit on the seat."
5,Great !,"It is a very sturdy, and easy to clean potty chair. Not alot of parts, cracks and crevasses to clean. Easy to wipe down and keep clean."
3,it's only OK,because while i liked how it looked my son didnt want to use it. i ended up with an elmo potty that flushes. he doesnt seem so interested in that one either. but the bjorn borg is very expensive for what you get. it is at least very sturdy.
5,Great,This potty is simple and very easy to clean with only two pieces. It is also more stable than others we used. We like it.
5,doc martin,Wanted to see the parts I missed. Very good subject matter and enjoyed the ambiguity of the plot and subject matter. Anyone wanting something a bit different in medicine would find this interesting.
5,I'm so glad they are back!,"It's been a long wait since season four, but I'm glad to see from this first epi that Doc Martin has lost none of its charm, humor and wonderful characters. Thanks to Amazon for making this season available!!!!"
5,Loved it,"Loved Season 5 just like all the others. Was so surprised to see complaints and the negative reviews about this season. I thought there were terrific performances by ""Mrs. Tishell"" and Martin's Aunt. This series will always be one of my favorites. Love the character development. Outstanding and enjoyable. Watch it from the beginning."
3,Not as good as the first ones,We love this series but disappointing now. They seem not to know where to go with him and her. A shame cause it was so charming.
5,Doc Martin,I received the dvd series 5 set in just a few days and at a very good price.Would be very happy to deal with them again.
4,Another Wonderful Year With The Doctor,"Doc Martin is a rascal that can't be kept down. In his tiny village by the sea, he now has to deal with a baby as well as the prospect of marriage, and the whole village is still at him with all of their inane problems. Just what will he do?Season 5 seems to bring a sense of humanity to the good doctor that I felt has been long in coming. His passion and knowledge is put to the test with the arrival of a new doctor and everyone in the village are at the ends of their sanity.The wit and dry-humor are well portrayed in this series and I look forward to the release of season 6 in the near future."
5,BEST SEASON,"I waited for this season and I have to say it was worth the wait. Doc Martin is an extremely upbeat comedy show I originally did not like. It seems that if you give something a chance, you might be surprised. This last season really shows the talented writers of this show."
5,Riveting series,"Can't wait for the next season. Writers have managed to gently tease out the story without being completely obvious. Actors, setting make it a delightful diversion from the usual tv fare."
2,Jumps shark in series 5,"Doc Martin was one of our favorite British TV shows...until Series 5. With Series 5 something has gone horribly wrong. The situations aren't funny, the characters are extremely irritating. Auntie Joan has disappeared and been replaced by a Martin's cold obnoxious mother. Louisa has had her baby and in almost every scene we have to see the baby drooling in his high chair. I suppose some people consider this to be cute, but it's very distracting. The humor of the first 4 seasons came from the rather compulsive and superior Doc interacting with quirky but good natured locals. Now, with Series 5, the locals are much more unlikable than before. Therefore there is very little humor. Doc Martin has just become another rather tedious soap opera. The dialog is no longer witty, the conflicts are dramatic, but unenlightening. As a soap opera it's just sub-par."
3,Missing Aunt Joan,"Perhaps it's the absence of Aunt Joan and Pauline, or perhaps it's Martin's lack of believable parenting skill, but this season is not as good as previous ones."
3,Disappointing,"We very much like British made Shows and specifically many BBC Productions.Ballykissangel, Monarch of the Glen...The stories of Doc Martín are thin in comparison and more and more over the top. The writers are running out of material for quality storytelling. Martin himself ( we like the actor) is too one dimensional. Nevertheless it has the British charme."
2,grumpy to nasty,"I am a fan of Clunes, but I am very disappointed in the series five. I was hoping he was slowly going to become more like William (William and Mary), but instead he becomes an even nastier Doc Martin and oh so cold. It's hard to laugh when he treats his wife so poorly, and what a father! I am just so disappointed."
1,Very disappointing,I can't imagine that anyone who loved seasons 1-4 can be anything but disappointed with season 5. The writing has reached such a state of decay that all the lovely characters have become mere cardboard cutouts. Everything is wrong with season 5. As others have noted the new characters add nothing to the texture of the show. The show relies on pratfalls and cheap gimmicks for laughs that only the simple minded would find amusing. The writing is clunky and inspires very tired performances. It seems the writers and actors have phoned this one in. Knowing how good it could have been makes the experience of season 5 all the more ghastly.
5,Now airing in massachusetts,"This is now airing on PBS in Cape Cod, Massachusetts. Meanwhile last week here (NYC area), PBS showed the Doc Martin Movie during a pledge drive, and warned viewers that if we don't send in a donation they might not be able to bring us Season 5. So why can't PBS bring it to all the other states??"
1,scam,This is not about the product because I have not been able to find it on my download. I think the order page was very poorly done because I wanted the DVD version and all of a sudden I was thanked for my purchase of the download version.
5,I love Doc Martin!,"I love this series. I enjoy getting to know all of the characters in this little village -- each with his or her own unique foibles and idiosyncrasies. They are not the ""beautiful people"" we typically see in a Hollywood production."
5,Fantastic series for anyone who needs a good laugh.,This is your chance to visit one of the most beautiful locations Great Britain has to offer and watch how a stuffy surgeon from London deals with a town full of quirky people. My wife and I own the entire set and we can't wait for Series 6.
5,I love this show!,"I spent the last week sick in bed and my sister recommended I watch this series on Netflix. I got hooked very quickly. I absolutely love this show with all of its wonderful, quirky characters. I had a lot of TV on TIVO I had planned to catch up on but once I started with this show I went through every episode from the first four seasons without watching any of my TIVO. I wish we had shows this good in the US! I can't wait for the next season to come out. If you haven't seen it, you must give it a try. I can't imagine not liking it, even if only for the beautiful scenery of Portwenn. (Really Port Isaac in Cornwall, England.) That location is now on my bucket list."
3,Falls short of previous standards,"Series 5, as some other reviewers have suggested, resorted to rather dull and obvious humor and rendered the Doc completely humorless. What I found so charming in the first four series was the way the dialogue was witty without slamming me in the face. I also miss the more intimate character developments and the Doc has become so surly in this series, as to make the conclusion such a leap in imagination as to be almost unbelievable. My hope for season 6 is that they tighten the scripts, maybe bring back some of the earlier writers, like the Minghellas, and really bring this show to the proper conclusion it deserves. The Doc needs to reassess what it is he truly wants, and better communication is needed all around. I would not buy the Season 5 DVD on its own. I did enjoy watching seasons 1-4 multiple times, and although season 5 is worth watching once, I am not as likely to view it again."
5,Terrific,One of our favorite series. We have seen all of the seasons available so far. We wish there were more!
5,Doc Martin season 5,Great series love this show great gift to people you want to make Laugh.The order was fast and came in great condition!!!
4,Social skills,"I've enjoyed the series tremendously, they're very entertaining. The story line continues to grow, never boring. I zipped through Series 5 and am anxiously awaiting the next season."
5,Doc Martin Series 5,"Congratulations to the writers and actors of this series. It is most enjoyable and is so interesting, that you just can't wait to see what will happen next in the life of Doc Martin. The actors who portray the characters, especially Bert Large, are hysterical. Pay close attention to the expressions on his face whenever he is talking. The man is a natural born actor. Martin Clunes,if he hasn't already, should receive some sort of an award for his portrayal of Doc Martin. I am hoping this series will continue in the future. I give it 5 stars!"
1,Does not play,I bought the Doc Martin Complete Season 5 for a gift and thought there would never be a problem actually playing the DVD. It was only when I happened to ask the person how they were enjoying the DVD that I discovered that they had been unable to play it. Imagine my disappointment and embarrassment to have given this gift only to discover that it didn't even work. And let's not talk about my wasted money in buying the DVD in the first place! :(
4,He's a good guy after all,"The four stars are for a couple of episodes where the DVD stops in places for a few seconds before moving on. I hope they don't become permanent!Otherwise, it would be 5 stars for a great series with great actors and stories."
5,"If you love Doc Martin, you'll love this","My husband ADORES this show. He has ALL the seasons and rations himself so he can make the seasons last longer. HAD to have this and of course, he loves it."
5,Great Series!,Great series! We really enjoyed this season! Very excited for the next one. Hopefully it will be available by the end of this year.
5,Great series.,"As usual the Brits have superior tv shows and are light-years beyond the rest of the world in mysteries. Doc Martin is for the most part family friendly without cussing or unmistakeable sexual themes and innuendo. Something American tv may never comprehend. Yes America, outstanding writers don't need to infiltrate every scripts dialogues with moronic, sophomoric sexual overtones and undertones."
5,Martinize Me!,"My wife introduced me to this series one evening not long after she started watching Season ""1"". I would not have admitted prior to the first couple of episodes that I would enjoy the show so much. The characters, Dr. Ellingham, Louisa, Burt and Al Large, Aunt Joan, and to many others to name are all so interesting in their own right. The beautiful scenery from the Cornwall setting is just a bonus for the well scripted dialogue and simple day to day situations. I would highly recommend this to anyone interested in light situational comedy without profanity or raunchy sexuality."
5,Great entertainment!,"Such a delightful series! The characters are all so lovable, even Martin! I want to vacation in Port Wenn and meet the villagers."
5,Dr. Martin season 5,I love the Doc Martin series. I have 1-4 and just had to have season 5. I'm finding that it is not quite as good as the first 4 seasons but I do still enjoy it. I wonder if they will run out of ideas and conclude the Doc Martin program or just keep going until popularity dies down.
5,Gruff as ever!,Another joust between Doc and the other characters. Can't even be nice to his baby's mom - bless her patient heart. I hope one of the series ends with a different climax. The first season was the birth and following seasons each have their own high point at the end. Can't we have at least one season when the Doc has his tantrums in the middle of the season?But it is an absorbing story because I keep waiting for him to learn some patience and self control as well as manners and more appropriate patient communication.
5,Wonderful series,"Good British television series. Wonderful characters of the ""fish out of water"" ilk, and well wotrh spending time with But start with seasn 1 and watch all the seasons. i don't think you will be disappointed."
5,I Love These Shows,"If you ever want to enter the land of slightly crazy and have a laugh party, Doc Martin is the show to watch. I have all of this series now with Series 5 and I have watched them over and over again. They never fail to tug at my heartstrings as really a sad clueless but so brilliant doctor and the unending patience of the woman who loves him. Everyone should buy this product if you enjoy a good laugh."
5,Can't wait for more!!!,"We were lucky enough to have ""Doc Martin"" premiere here in Sacramento California on our local PBS station Sunday Nov.18,2012. After viewing just one episode, my husband and I just knew this must have been a hit show in England, so I went to Amazon, and sure enough there were the reviews!! We knew, after just one episode we had to see the rest, and were delighted to find out it ran for many years. So, based on our good feelings, and the great,informative reviews on Amazon, we purchased the first 4 seasons. We will be buying the movie, as well, I'm sure. We don't usually buy discs of TV series or movies, but we were unsure just how long our PBS station would carry the show.Thanks to all of you who wrote such informative reviews!! Can't wait to find out what goes on in that quirky little town, with the Doctor who is sort of the English version of our American Dr. House."
1,Beyond Understanding,"I'll be brief. I stopped my remote at the Doc Martin program. It's that has some one running around with a shotgun. I kept watching to see if it was supposed to be a dark comedy. Possibly it would move in some direction that could amuse or interest.It is just plain terrible, boring. My question is how does this stuff get made? I would appreciate an explanation from some one. I thought I could explain the interest people have in any thing, this is beyond me. If any one can think there is some hip structure under the thing they are fooling themselves."
5,not to be missed,"If you have become a Doc Martin fan, or addict as I have this is a must see. Hate to see an end to this fabulous show. Fell in love with all the quirky characters."
5,"IT'S DOC MARTIN, WHAT ELSE IS THERE TO SAY?","If you're a Doc Martin addict, as I am, you're going to love Season 5. I'm told this review is too short, but why say more if it isn't necessary. That'll do it, I think."
2,no recommendation,"I used Criminal Law by Gardner and Anderson as my text when I taught an undergrad Criminal Law class. I found it overly simplistic, even for that level, and left my students with too many loose ends. The case excerpts used are drastically edited, sometimes only a sentence, which does not help demonstrate the proposition the cases supposedly stand for. It seemed that the authors also spent an inordinate amount of text on relatively unimportant topics. I also found the instructor's edition to be unhelpful."
3,Used 7th edition as secondary material for teaching undergrad CrimLaw,"The layout of the book is user friendly, and the case extracts are concise. I designated it as a reference book for my students and placed it on call in the library for them to review. It can be overly simplistic for an advanced reader, but on target for a good majority of freshman students. Maybe the 8th edition will show some evolution."
3,easy law read,"required for college class, lots of details easy law read, but not as in depth as i would like, but ok"
3,Read Carefully,"This was sent later than it was supposed to be, so it obviously arrived a few weeks into class (after first test). It also arrived as loose-leaf. I made it work, but I was shocked and it is very inconvenient, since reselling is pretty much out of the question. That was not noted prominently, if it was noted at all. Make sure you read the product description more carefully than I did. I have never seen a book shipped that way."
2,Book not as described,"I cannot actually review the book as it is not a bound book so it was never opened. If you by this book, please be aware it is a loose leaf edition."
1,Review,I odered the 11th edition and received the 10th. I'm actually pretty mad because I might not be able to use the 10th and I have to waste more money because you sent me the wrong edition.
3,Had to have it for class,"I had to have this book for class. It did give easy explainations. But, it was the instructor that made the class better."
5,The Story Keepers Videos,Received the order very quickly and in good condition. Bought them for my sister who works at a Christian Daycare Center. She had been searching for them so I surprised her. Her class and her grandchildren are really enjoying them! Thank you so much!
5,Made in USA!,"It serves its purpose, it's made of sturdy polypropylene or HDPE plastic & it's made in the USA! I have an old one that's over 10 years old & now sits in my toolbox. The new ones I bought will be for more sanitary purposes."
5,DataSafe NPX-50TFR Lead Acid Battery,Replacement battery for a Toro electric lawn mower (4 batteries required). The replacment battery was received in excellent condition and has worked reliably all of the 2012 mowing season.
5,Best book for reading ever written,This is one of the most helpful and teacher friendly books I have ever used. You don't have to read it from cover to cover to use it. I use it weekly in my planning.
4,AMAZING. The bible of literacy.,"This is the book you need for creating and maintaining a solid and authentic classroom literacy program. ""The First Twenty Days"" alone is extreemely helpful. You can start small and grow as you feel comfortable. A little overwhelming at times but worth it!"
4,Great Guideline for New Teachers,This book has helped me tremendously with my new job as a teacher. Going to school did not prepare me as much as this book has.
5,Perfect!,"I bought one new years ago then retired, teaching again, so I needed this piece of my reading program. Condition of the book was like new. Thanks."
4,so far great ideas,"It's a big book and I've only skimmed it. But, I've already incorporated a lot of ideas into my classroom and my 3rd grade students aren't complaining...rather they're enjoying language arts. Of course, TAKS is not until February so time will tell if it works according to my state's standards.I'm excited about another F&P; product that I saw by chance in the principal's hallway. My admins have ordered the Word Study program. I'm sure this will really help me with the Word Study part of the total F&P; Reading & Writing ""system"" [which is what the Guiding Readers & Writers book is all about]."
5,Can change your practice!!,"You'll be surprised by the progress your kids will make, when you teach using the methods described in this book. You will reach learners at every level and do so in an authentic way that provides each student with choices and opportunities to become instrumental in their own learning. You will foster the love of reading and writing and the children will beg you to do reading/writing workshop. What a gift Fountas and Pinnell have given children across the country! If you teach grades 3-6, it is a staple...must have!"
4,my mind is blown,"Good vibe, a bit of a homemade musical quality, and A+ lyrics...makes you remember how good a good country rockin song can be...highly recommended"
5,INCREDIBLE,"This music will inspire you to love American history. It will take you on a journey so that you feel as though you are in Phillie. I guarantee that if you enjoy soundtracks and more conventional musicals you will fall head over heels in love with this music. I am sure you will find that the talent Brent Spiner displays in this musical can not even be described with words. I saw this show on Broadway. And I must tell you that listening to this soundtrack puts me back in the Gershwin every time. Every member of the cast shows tremendous talent and there is no weak link. You shouldn't even have to think twice about purchasing this amazing, and awe inspiring soundtrack. If this review can't convince you that it is worth the money, nothing will."
5,INCREDIBLE,This is the most incredible musical I have ever seen. It was not as flashy as many shows on broadway and so it had to keep audiences with talent and amazement. I can safely say that it does that very easily. I get chills when I listen to this soundtrack. Brent Spiner is wonderful. He is the best John Adams I have ever heard. While the entire cast is fantastic. Brent and one other stand out in my mind. Gregg Edelman delivers a spell-binding performance of Molasses to Rum. Get this cd. It is one of the greatest broadway soundtracks ever!
1,can i give it no stars? no? darn. . .,"Okay, I saw this musical with my school, at Ford's Theater of all places. A review I read there said that the reviewer was ""enraptured"" and ""could hardly breathe."" Me, I could hardly breathe for laughing so hard at the sheer stupidity of the songs. As for being enraptured, i DID have to stare hard at the stage a lot, simply because i forgot my glasses. . . Anyway, this music is pathetic, though it was fun to imitate afterwards. It's not worth seeing or listening to. It IS hard to write a musical about the signing of the Declaration of Independence. Why did they bother? In more simple terms, IT SUCKS!!!"
5,Absolutely tremendous! Well worth the money!,"""1776: The New Broadway Cast Recording"" is a tremendous collaboration of the music and songs from the equally terrific musical. Brent Spiner is a tremendous John Adams; Pat Hingle is absolutely wonderful as Ben Franklin; and Michael Cumpsty and Gregg Edelman are great as John Dickinson and Edward Rutledge, respectively. You will not be disappointed in this CD - it makes you feel as though you are in the mammoth Gershwin Theatre watching the Tony-nominated musical."
5,This is one of the best musicals ever!!!,"When i first heard the song ""Lees of old Virginia"" I went out and bought this CD immediately!!! All the main character's voices are superb. Although he does not really have a large part, i beleive that the best singer in this great CD is Mr. Rotlidge, who sings the solo ""Molasses to Rum"" which is a great song, even though it is about slavery. And Benjamin Fraklin is hilarious. Adams is also funny. This musical is awesome! it is the best of the best of the best! I would say other than Les Miserables and Miss Saigon, this is one of the best broadway shows ever written! if your a fan of musicals, you NEED to get this CD."
2,MUSICAL IN SEARCH OF BETTER VOICES,"This recording really lacks the one necessary ingredient - great voices - that made the original recording so wonderful. When this first came out, the music as both incredibly singable and memorable for the very reason that the voices were so good and it stuck with you.I would skip this latest release and get the original cast recording. It's just so much better."
3,A Mans Show,"For anyone looking for male songs, or a male show to put on, this is the soundtrack for you. It has great ballads as well as big chorus numbers for the male sex. However the subject matter just didnt grab me by the throat and make me love it. History isnt my thing. That being said, the music and lyrics are great, and worth the money. This is a good one to get if your interested in broadway, but not the Rodgers and Hamerstein style. My favorite songs are ""Molasses to Rum"" and ""Momma Look Sharp."""
5,True Cathelete experience,I am a FitTv exerciser and a Cathelete. This is better than FitTv....no commercials!!!
3,Disappointed...,"I am an avid Cathe fan -- have over 10 of her DVDs and watch her workouts on FitTV. I bought this DVD for the Rhythmic Step workout, but was looking forward to the other 2 included on the disk. What was she thinking???? --- she included 2 workouts from ""ancient times""! This is really a jip! Her other combination DVDs include ""worthy"" workouts -- making the cost worthwhile --- Being such a fan of hers for several years now -- and being that I rely on her solely for my workouts, I feel able to criticize this disk. Very disappointing! On a more positive note, the Rhythmic Step portion is VERY challenging -- if you have never done Cathe's step routines before this one, you will probably be lost. But, if you have --- you will really enjoy this one -- it is like you are dancing, but she really gets your heart rate up! I just wish she had included her more timely workouts and not those from the 70s/80s ""leg warmer/headband"" days! :("
3,Size,Didn't fit my inspiron 9300. Be careful about ordering this is your laptop is a large 15.4 incher.
1,Two words - it died,"It was quite an opportune time for Amazon to ask me to review this item, because it just died on me :)After a few weeks of great use, one day on plugging in I got a ""device not recognized"" error on plugging in, and that's where it has stayed. Luckily the hard disk is fine, I tested it in another enclosure.I don't see any obvious problems (like burnt circuitry), so have no idea what happened. I am just going to write off the $12+, and buy a different brand and hopefully better luck."
2,"Not exactly durable, does the job.","I bought two of these cases a few years ago and since then they've begun to fall apart. The backing on one case came off and on the other, the front end is gone. As for being enclosures, they work and I can transfer my data, but they aren't very good looking. Being encased in metal with no fan is also bad, as there's no on/off switch like some of my other enclosures.All in all, if you're looking for a quick, dirty, and cheap solution, go ahead, but if you want something to match an aesthetic or be long lasting, I'd steer clear and invest in something a little better constructed."
4,"great print, but short","i would wear it more often, but it is short, so i feel like i have to hide that fact by tucking it into a coat. i love the print, though."
1,Pacifica,"The music was so loud over the words, it was really garbled and I did'nt like it and I returned it. Amadan is one of my favorite groups, especailly live. I was disappointed. Boo.. Hoo"
2,Let's get real,"The thing that bothers me about books like this is, disco gets ALL the blame for the demise of ""black music"" but rap/hiphop always gets a free pass.No I don't like it that disco seemed to take over & knock the superior Funk genre out of the way but at least in disco, people were still playing INSTRUMENTS.What is considered R&B;,since the mid 90s is basically just beats & nothing more.There is nothing in this book expressing dismay at the thought of DJs & sampling replacing LIVE BANDS,which is the true death of R&B;."
4,Best is Joplin!,"Janis Joplin rocks on this release! Jefferson Airplane are not usually good live, but in this instance, they've polished up their act to sound best on TV! Richie Havens has always had a special place in my heart and his performances here are good. Vanilla Fudge is nothing but pure 60's nostalgia, nothing more. They're not much live, to tell you the truth. I believe that's everyone, if I'm missing somebody, it's cause they weren't that memorable."
3,Can't Change Me Import Sinngle,"The first single from Chris Cornell's solo debut ""Euphoria Morning"", Can't Change Me, has a strange mix of instrumentation provided by Chris' band, Eleven. Laid over the twangy blend is Chris' signature deep brooding vocals which all Soundgarden fans will appreciate. Fluttergirl is a demo version of the albums Beatle-esque second track. This version is mostly Chris and an acoustic guitar. Cornell says that this was meant to be a singers record. On special tracks like this, his voice really gets to shine. It is very much a must have for any fan of Cornells' music. Nowhere But You is one of those non-songs, simply a deep, dark, cold acoustic guitar plucking a repeated rhythm with Chris' spacy vocals somehere in the background barely heard. Theres not a lot of melody in it but quite a bit of substance. The guitar part doesn't really sound like a real song, but by the end you will find yourself nodding right along."
2,missing a bottle of lotion,"I only received 1 of the 2 15 oz bottles of lotion, very upset because it states a pack of 2."
1,Ingredients??,"Have you ever read the ingredients in this lotion? I was so surprised to see this product has a perfect 5 star rating. I mean sure it's been around forever, but don't you think it's time they took our children's health seriously? Half the ingredients are linked to cancer and other disorders!Water; Propylene Glycol; Myristyl Myristate; Glyceryl Stearate; Oleic Acid; Stearic Acid; Polysorbate 61; C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate; Dimethicone; Isopropyl Palmitate; Sorbitan Stearate; Cetyl Alcohol; Synthetic Beeswax; Stearyl Alcohol; Benzyl Alcohol; Carbomer; Fragrance; Methylparaben; Propylparaben; Butylparaben; BHT; Sodium Hydroxide; Red 33"
3,very useful product,"I have extremely sensitive combination skin and have to be very careful what I use, especially on my face. After trial and error with many different products, I have never ever had any problems with this one. After I bathe, I use it as my everyday moisturizer on my face and body."
3,smelling good.,I love this lotion a lot. It moisturizes my skin and leaves it smelling good. It's good for all types of skin from normal to extra dry. It's good for me because other lotions break my skin out and this lotion doesn't. You can even use it on a daily basis. You won't regret using it.
1,DO NOT BUY - Imposter Johnson & Johnson Baby Lotion,"I have been using Johnson and Johnson Baby Lotion on my kids for years. I ordered a 6 pack of this lotion because it was a good price and I like buying in bulk for convenience. Once I used the lotion, I knew it wasn't the real thing. The smell is horrible and it is very thin. Then I looked on the packaging and compared it to REAL Johnson and Johnson Baby Lotion and the ingredients were different and also this Imposter lotion states that it is Made in Italy!! The real Johnson and Johnson is made in NJ. DO NOT BUY this lotion - it is not real Johnson and Johnson. I threw out all 6 bottles - what a waste of $. I will never buy anything from the Seller Splashdeal again."
5,Dependable lotion,"Do you find that every time you go to buy body lotion, your favorite brand has changed something? Johnson's baby lotion is the same great, light, dependable all day body lotion."
3,"Interesting, Terrible, Strange","Mailer's memoir is sui generis- it is an unbelievably arrogant exercise in self-creation. Although Mailer complicates the relation of the work to the creator through an eclectic compilation of self-portraits, self-criticisms, and self-praise, this is still a deeply troublesome book. Mailer's self-aggrandizements probably did more harm than good, though it was clearly inherent in the psychology of his creativity. What emerges here is an interesting portrait of the self-creation of a writer-and writers who are interested in problems of method and strategy should read it, because Mailer makes you believe you can produce magic through developing the proper disposition. An esoteric work, with a wide variety of writing."
2,Mailer promised so much more than he ever delivered,"All during the 1960s, when authors still appeared on The Tonight Show, The Dick Cavett Show, etc, the two authors who had the most exposure and most proclaimed their ""genius"" were Norman Mailer and Truman Capote. Both fizzled miserably. Their dwindling fame will be filed under ""Celebrity"" rather than ""Literature."" Mailer is the better of the two, but he has not worn well."
4,The Magnificent Ambersons is well-constructed.,"One is hard-pressed to find such a well-crafted book as this. The melodramatic goings-on of the have and the have-nots as played out in this plot will have one yelling ""yes"" or ""no"" at every turn. While not a book of tremendous substance, it is a wonderful look back at a time when senses of decorum and verisimilitude ruled the young and the old, and one's standing in society was ultimately more important than one's happiness. If that is not enough to persuade you to read this book, then how 'bout: It's a really great read and you'll finish all 506 pages in a sitting or two."
2,Pulitzer? REALLY??,"I just can't believe a book of this caliber won a Pulitzer. I do admit to being pulled into the story at times, but the writing is deeply flawed. The protagonist is unlikeable, the characters often react inconsistently, and finally, the last 20 pages of the novel are jaw-droppingly bad--the deux ex machina ending was beyond belief. Also, I should note that the edition I have is full of typos.I'm going to rent the movie to see Welles' interpretation. While this novel has redeeming qualities . . . good grief--a PULITZER??"
3,Historical perspective,This novel is a period piece that provides an interesting view of high society in a midwest community. The development of the main character is unique and unpredictable.
2,A Bit Overblown,"One cannot deny the delight of the prose in this book. Here is my favorite quote: ""Mrs. Johnson came in, breathing noticeably: and her round head, smoothly but economically decorated with the hair of an honest woman, seemed to be lingering far in the background of the Alpine Bosom which took precedence of the rest of her everywhere.""But excellent use of the English language can only go so far and at the end of the day I found this novel to be woefully dated. The crux of the action in the story really centers on the manners and norms of the day and I was unable to muster any sympathy for two adults who forego their own happiness to appease a spoiled youngster.If you, like me, are keen to work your way through Pulitzer prize winning novels, then do put this on the list, otherwise, take a pass."
2,"Here's the Movie, Now Where's the Book?","If you're a movie fan, you've probably seen the Orson Welles movie version of this novel, or at least seen scenes of it in various retrospectives. You may be curious about the novel now specifically because it recently was named one of the Modern Libray Top 100. You may be wondering why. Chances are, even if you're an English major, you've never heard of Booth Tarkington. If your grandparents have a shelf of forgotten books in their attic, this novel might be one of them. Its hard to understand why the Modern Library choses this as one of the 100 best novels in English. It seems as near to being forgotten as a book can be, and perhaps it is better left so."
1,Minus,"This is trash. Badly written, melodramatic, utterly silly. My copy is already in the recycle (not: re-use) bin."
5,My daughter loves this little dog!,"I bought this because I thought it would be fun to play with online for my 5 year old daughter. My daughter loves the toy itself and sleeps with the dog every night. It seems pretty durable. The online world for these pets though seems a little too hard for little kids to be able to do on their own. Also hate the fact that Webkinz has chatrooms. I thought it would just be little games for the kids to play, but you have to be able to read and answer questions in order to earn money for your online pet, so parents have to plan to spend time answering goofy trivia questions. Just not what I was expecting. Seems more geared towards older kids or even adults. So if you have little ones, I would buy it just for the toy and not for the online stuff."
5,So tiny and cute!,I've had this Webkinz for more then a year and she's had no holes! Very durable! She is very tiny but still very cute. I named mine Princess! Online she looks adorable!
4,Night Watch,"A post-magical apocalypse political thriller and story about succession and inheritance in several senses.Stewart writes beautifully and creates original, well-detailed worlds. There were two aspects of this book that didn't work so well for me: first, the political thriller plot became incoherent, and second, the Chinatown culture seemed stereotypical (martial arts, empty cups of tea, whatever). On the other hand, I loved his evocation of the North Coast forest, and the way the elegance of his descriptions is grounded by down-to-earth characters and moments of humor.I'd recommend this, but not as strongly as GALVESTON or CLOUDS END."
4,"Unusual world, interesting to visit.","I like Sean Stewart (disclosure) but think that Perfect Circle and Mockingbird are his best works. This is quite different from those books, but still and interesting read. Perhaps this is more comparable to Galveston.This is not a ""big world"" book. It focuses on two cities in a future where magic has become strong (but is beginning to ebb again) and the two different cultures these cities have and the differences between them.It has some very clever magic. Forests that are conscious and protect some of the characters and dead armies that lightly interact with the living.Ultimately, it is a little flat in character development, but an interesting read."
1,Platitudinous & Insipid,"Laughably weak effort -- the ""running book"" equivalent of a 9 hr marathon. The advice is incredibly banal. I bought it used for the postage plus 1 cent and still felt cheated. Unreal that this kind of junk gets published!"
4,"Very good tool, but lacks on mileage specifics","Overall, very good. Lot's of helpful advice. My only gripe is that training charts are written in minutes, not miles (author assumes a 10 minute mile). While this is nice from a stop-watch point of view, for those of us who run faster (or in my case, slower) than a 10 minute mile, the book was unclear whether it's more important to focus on time or mileage in one's training...."
2,good (only) for beginners,"If you start running just now and want to run a marathon this is a good book for you. If you already have some running years of experience, and perhaps already ran a marathon, it won't help you. What is written is very basic, very well known to anyone who has already ran for a short time. I wanted help on ""how to train for and run my best marathon"", I didn't get it from this book."
3,not bad for a beginner,this book had all the generic information you find in most running books. i do not recommend this to any experienced runner. the author was trained by benji durden of boulder colorado and the routine in the book is similiar to his routine that i follow from a 1993 runner's world article (5 pages) that really works. i was kind of disappointed when i ordered this book because i based it on the other reviews and was expecting to learn something new about the marathon.
3,Not applicable for the desktop user,"This book hasn't been of much help to me. My review might be too strict. This book may be useful to people running Linux on servers and networks.But to the average desktop user, I'd dare say, it's useless. Linux has been very smooth to me so far. I've used SuSE and use Fedora Core. All (minor) problems that I've faced have been easily solved through the various Linux forums.I have not read this book cover to cover and this may be an unfair review but, still, I can't recommend it to the average user; either newbie or advanced. System administrators should not read my review!Anyway, the book focuses a lot on Fedora Core 1. It has two chapters for Debian and SuSE. I guess that if this book addressed more to system administrators, it should focus on distros like Red Hat Enterprise Linux or Debian."
2,Simpson's Flag,"If there was ever an episode of the Simpson's that highlighted Michigan this would be the flag they use. As another review said it looks like a cartoon, and it's not the correct colors or proportion. All that being said it was $5.00 so curb your expectations."
5,Home State Pride,"THe flag I bought was inexpensive, but it looks nice. the image is reversed on the other side, but I don't really care, because it is a wall decoration, and I won't be looking at the reverse side. I love my home State, and I'm glad I got its flag to look at every day."
3,Backwards Flag,"I returned my flag because it was backwards. If you attached it to the flag pole, the flag would need to fly from RIGHT to LEFT inorder to be viewed so you could read it. A normal flying flag flys from LEFT to Right. I returned it to the seller, and was I was informed that all the Michigan flags were this way, and my money was refunded plus shipping."
4,TRYING TO POTTY TRAIN TODDLER,"We bought this for our grandson, one for his home and one for ours in hopes of getting him to want to go on the toilet and rid him of his diapers. He is now just over 2 and no luck so far but we like the seat and we are sure he will some day soon."
3,Returned this product.,I was looking for something I could take with me to use in public restrooms or at other people's homes since my son is afraid of big toilets. I ended up returning this and getting the Fisher Price Travel Potty that comes with a case for around $17.00 from Wal-Mart. It works much better than this toilet trainer.
2,Too UNcomfortable for my toddler,"I got this as a ""hand-me-down"" that was never used and I see why. My child won't sit on it at all, she prefers a potty chair. She cries as soon as I try to put her on it, and it does NOT fit that tight on our toilet. I tried to give it away to a friend, who bought the seat and her child won't sit on it either."
3,"comfortable product, quality can be improved","The seat is very comfortable and my 2-years old loves it. The only reason I give it a 3-star is because the plastic next to the handle broke after a few months of use, and I didn't even hang the seat on the wall when not in use. For the price of this product, the product should be more durable."
4,Nice Toilet Trainer,This is a nice seat but the adjustable part in the back doesn't really work for our toilet. It's ok though since it stays on the toilet nicely and doesn't move around. Works great for our little boy
5,Great for boys!,Using it with my 2 year old. Only toilet trainer that works!!!! Highly recommend to anyone who has a boy
5,We own 3 of these - Good Stuff,"Not much to say. They are easy to install, comfortable for the kids, and easy to remove when not in use. There is a wheel that can tighten the unit to the toilet seat if you have a dedicated kid bathroom. We don't. And without tightening the seats stay firmly in place. When not in use, you can place a hook on your wall and hang it.Strongly recommend. Had them for 2+ years and still going strong."
4,works for us,"Easy to clean. Stays in place (even w/o using the built-in ""lock""). Seems comfrontable. Splash guard could be larger (but let's be honest, unless you're putting a Jai alai cesta on there, not sure anything is really going to contain the misses of an active 2yr old boy!)"
2,Would not recommend for boys,"Though this is a nice sturdy potty seat and would probably be perfect for girls or larger boys, it did not work for me. My son has to hoist himself off and on the potty as he is not yet tall enough to rest his feet on the foot stool while using it. The pee guard is so large that I was seriously concerned about his ""equipment"" being damaged in the process of trying to stand up. I recommend the Arm and Hammer potty seat over this (much cheaper too)."
5,Glad I found this!,My search for a potty seat that would fit an oval toilet ended here. I love that it can be adjusted to fit so it isn't sliding around when toddler is trying to sit down on it. Great product for the oblong toilet!!
3,Ok if space limited,"I have a tiny half bath on first floor that we put this in/on, so if space is limited its OK. The fully potty is MUCH better especially for beginners. He can't get his pants down, climb up on the stool and hurdle the splash guard to get up on this one, in time hopefully it will be better. Says universal, however no matter how much cranking I do on the dial to tighten it, it still seems to be loose. He also seems to pee between the toilet seat and the potty seat sometimes. He also doesn't really like it and prefers to trek upstairs to use his full BabyBjorn potty."
5,simple and does what it's supposed to do well,A friend gave me one when my daughter was 9 months old and we've been using that since then. The curvature of the ring cover fits both the toilet and baby's bottom really well. It does not move on the toilet as some other designs do. It's easy to clean. I also have a cover with cartoon characters on it but my daughter would keep moving off it and trying to see the characters so it's really distracting. The Bjorn one does what it's supposed to do and does it well. Now my daughter is 2 years old and started potty training a few weeks ago. I like the Bjorn so much that i bought another one for our 2nd bathroom also.
5,We Love it!,My wife and I are both very happy with this product. Very convinient. Great design. We found it on Amazon and bought it because of the reviews and are glad we did.
3,Doesn't fit on smaller more rounded toilets.,"We got it due to all of the amazing reviews and assumed it would fit on what we thought was a normal size toilet. We rent a duplex and the bathroom is a little small for a normal home but is the usual size for any type of renting. I don't think this toilet or the last 4, from previous apartments, is any different in size and even with the adjustments this trainer will not fit.It's too oval shaped and goes right up the back of the toilet seat making it a very awkward and barely usable fit. Be careful if you think your toilet is a little small or of a more rounded than oval shape."
3,good seat but didn't work for us completely,"I don't remember where I purchased this seat but it was the second one I tried for potty training. The seat is good, nice construction but it did not work on our toilet seat. We have a Bemis brand, easy close elongated seat, the opening is about 10 inch long, just under 8 inches wide, with a curve to the seat, this seat did not work on it at all. We brought it to my in-laws for the kids to use there and it fits no problem. Both my daughter and niece use it at grandmas with no issues.I really wish they would show you pictures of the under side of the seats and the measurements for the minimum opening. After two seats I'm still trying to find one to fit on our toilet."
2,Not for a Boy.,"This seat is not for a boy who is 1st learning to potty by sitting. In the picture it looks as though the built in deflector is fairly large, though it is not, it does not do it's job. I love the contour of the seat. But if I pay $29.99 for a potty seat I don't want to clean the bathroom everytime after he goes potty-what a mess. I have found a potty that I love and that works, it is much cheaper as well. I'm wandering if this potty might be worth holding onto until my son is handling more than one buisness in the potty, (if you know what I mean). Until then this is not the potty for me, if I had a girl maybe. But I have a boy, so please think about this before you buy. I did read one review somewhere that also had this complaint, I wish I who have listened. They need to make the deflector better or make one for boys and one for girls."
4,A little big for my little girl,"I like the style and ease of this potty seat, but for my daughter, the hole is much too big. She squirms on it, and will not use it unless I am holding onto her-she starts to slip and fall in. I am having to end up buying a much smaller seat. Hopefully she will grow into this one. She is 2 1/2 and a little on the small side."
5,Great stability for BIG boy on oval toilet,"Regular training seats you place on top of an adult size toilet just were not stable enough for my son. Add the fact that one of our toilets is oval and it was a BAD fit. Also add that he's a very big boy and regular seats would allow him to pee right over the little pee catcher (don't know the official term ;) for that part). He'd say, ""Mommy - I fall"" and didn't want to try. This seat works great because you can adjust it to make it fit with more stability."
3,Does not fit TOTO elongated toilets,"I bought this after reading the rave reviews. The product felt sturdy, but unfortunately I didn't fit my TOTO elongated toilet. It was not able to grip onto the toilet seat because TOTO's seat has a downward curved opening (sorta hard to describe). Don't buy this unless your toilet seat is completely flat. I'm going to return it this week. I hope there will be no trouble with Amazon accepting this unused product."
4,potty seat,"Love this seat. My daughter is almost 3 and fits perfect on it. No slipping around and fits any size toilet. I gave it 4 stars because I feel it's a lot of money for a toilet seat, but it works better then the ""fun"" cartoon kind."
4,Does the job,"Here is what I like about this:- you can adjust some fitting with the turn of a dial on the inside back of the seat so that it doesn't shift when on the Toilet (this way I can use it on different toilet bowls and it sits steady)- just one piece (that way things don't get in between the pieces), less mess and easy to clean- contoured etc and all the stuff they say in their descriptionWhat I wish was different: I wish that the seat was a little cushioned. If he's been on the potty for a while, poor thing has red marks on his butt. (it goes away, just don't like seeing that)"
5,fits perfectly!,"We have an elongated Toto toilet with an angled toilet seat. I bought a standard potty seat initially, which slid back and forth on the toilet seat. My daughter was terrified and refused to sit on it. After reading the reviews online, I bought the Baby Bjorn. Fits perfectly, does not move. I read another review that said the ""wings"" that the dial uses to latch on to the seat need to be removed to fit an elongated seat, but we did not have that problem. Put the Baby bjorn on our toilet seat, twisted the dial, and viola, the seat does not move. Highly recommend this potty seat!"
2,The adjustable feature doesn't work,The adjustment in the back does not stay in place so it's really just a bulky version of a regular toilet reducer with extra places for germs to accumulate. At this price you are better off with a toilet seat that has a child seat built in. This is a bit wobbly and children take longer to be independent on them.
5,Toilet Trainer,"It is perfect and is worth every penny. Easy to clean, adjustable, and my child can put it on/take it off without assistance, which makes my life so much easier! Definitely 5 stars!"
5,Best Potty Seat for Elongated Toilets & Boys...,I have bought two BabyBjorn Toilet Trainers for my elongated toilets...they are a bit more expensive but so worth every penny...they don't shift when tightened onto the toilet seat...I have tried other seats & they moved all around which scared my son...my son can easily put it on and off the toilet seat himself...it has a convienent loop on the end that I can attach to a hook for easy storage...it works great for little boys who need to sit down when first being train...the tinkle stays in the potty. I highly recommend this potty seat especially if you have an elongated toilet seat and/or a little boy!!!
4,good potty for a boy,just starting out but the potty fits great on an adult toilet and is great for a boy sitting down.
5,Perfect!,"Great little toilet seat is adjustable to fit round and oval seats. Such adjustment, along with the rubber ring around it make for a very stable seat. Of course, saving the space in the bathroom by using this is a great benefit to those with small bathrooms. One huge plus that we havent seen a lot of on other training seats, is that there is a raised front to act as a ""pee wall"" for my clown of a son. :)Bought two we were so impressed."
5,Great Potty Seat!,I love this toilet seat! It is very easy to clean and fits really well on my oblong toilet seat. It doesn't wiggle or slip out from under my toddlers. This is the 3rd seat I have purchased and it may be the last. Thanks!
2,Doesn't fit the big potty,"Would have loved to use this potty seat. Our 2yr old son has been very successful and is completely potty trained, but is still very small compared to the potty. We've had 2 other seats both of foam / foam plastic and they make me nuts that no matter how much or how long I clean them I can't ever get the ""SMELL"" out from what seeps inside the foam. This seat is a great idea (all easy to clean plastic) no openings, made for a boy, and most importantly not made of any foam. Problem...it DOESN'T FIT! No potty at our house or my parents. We have a new home and standard toilet seats, my parents are quite older, but still standard and of course we can use the gross seats everywhere. Very disappointed."
5,Excellent toilet trainer,"We purchased this toilet trainer because of its elongated hole. The regular potties have such a small, circular hole that my son didn't fit well on it. Also, the splash guard is higher than on most potties, which is excellent for boys."
4,Designed for comfort and ease of use but poor quality,"I would have given this product 5 stars for design, comfort and ease of use but quality was a big issue. As most moms who are potty training know, it's kind of messy. I was wiping down the potty seat with a Lysol wipe and the oval handle at the back of the potty seat cracked along the plastic edge. The potty seat can still be used, but it was disappointing considering the price. I probably wouldn't let this discourage me from purchasing the product. It's a great design that can be used easily and makes the potty look more comfortable for little ones."
5,Good design,"This is a very well-designed potty seat:- Our toddler thinks it's very comfortable.- The rubber rim prevents it from slipping.- The sizing mechanism is simple to use, takes only a few seconds to get adjusted to virtually any toilet, and holds on very securely.- The handle is useful for carrying or hanging the seat.- Overall, seems to be very durable.The only downside is that it isn't exactly tiny. It's a couple of inches narrower and shorter than a typical toilet seat, and is roughly 3 or 4 inches thick at its thickest point, making it awkward to place in a diaper bag. It's hard to imagine any way this problem could be eliminated, however."
2,Too small,Our daughter used this for a little while but I had to keep watching her because even though she is petite it seemed like it was easy for her to scoot onto the back of the seat. I also found it hard to clean because you have to untighten the hinge to take it off to clean underneath. At preschool she was using the stand-alone potty so we bought the babybjorn equivalent and she now just uses that instead. That is easier to clean than I thought.
5,Great seat!,Fits perfectly on our toilet and is easy for our 23-month-old daughter to sit on securely. She can even put it on the toilet herself.
5,Well made and DOES fit any regular seat!!,"Haven't had the opportunity to need this yet as we are still utilizing the baby potty seated on the floor as our guy is too little to get on the regular potty yet. However, wanted to get everything together and ready when we will need it. This seat is very well made and really like that it is all one piece so there is no need to worry about bacteria collecting around a ""snap on"" deflector (for boys). Purchased 2 of these, one for myself at my home and one for my daughter and son-in-law at theirs, as they are in the process of potty training our grandson. It was easy to adjust to fit our regular seats, and I now have it on a hook next to the regular potty when the time comes that we are ready to use it. I also purchased the stool and potty book...and am ready whenever my kiddies are. Highly recommend this seat as it very well made."
2,Did not work for my Grandson,"My 20 month old Grandson was afraid to sit on the toilet with the Toilet Trainer. When he did urinate, the urine guard was not high enough & he urinated on the area directly in front of the toilet. I did try to position him right up close to the urine guard & he really didn't like that. He has been using a potty chair at home, so I ended up buying the BabyBjorn potty chair with the high back & he likes this. I think he can tilt forward a bit with the use of his legs on the floor, so this helps with him being able to urinate in the potty chair."
1,Does not adjust to 3 of my 4 toilets,"I was excited about this potty but it only fits 1 of toilets which has a more oblong shape, it doesn't fit my standard more circular toilets. It is a shame since it seems to be well designed. I like the babybjorn stool and potty chairs - they are great."
1,daughter won't use it,"We bought a cheap toilet seat that didn't quite fit our toilet, but my daughter was using just fine. We decided to splurge for this one once she seemed ready for more serious toilet training. She's 2 and from the first time we put her on this, she said it hurt her legs. The splash guard is wide and digs into her legs and she absolutely refuses to sit on it. Fits the toilet really well, but that's all I can say positive about this potty seat. Disappointed!"
2,Does not attach well,"I bought it based on so many great reviews. I wonder if I am the only one who was not able to attach it to the existing toilette seat. The description says ""adjusts easily and sits firmly in place""...well, it does not. It slides right out of the existing seat. SO I basically keep in there not attached at all and have to sit my child and remove him from there, otherwise the seat falls out."
3,"great fit, but not perfect","My son was using $10 similar potty seat, but it collected so much urine when he went pee, and we were so tired of clean up by disassemble the parts and wipe inside as well as outside every time he went. So I started looking for another one that can be put on and off the toilet. I read a lot of reviews on this one and felt good about it, so I purchased. The potty trainer fits so well to our toilet and I was so happy about it. My son is very picky and hate changes, but when he saw this one, he rarely fussed about it and sat on almost right away. That itself was a big accomplishment, but when he went pee, it splashed and leak from sides of the center part even though he was leaning down and made mess. I was disappointed. Now he learned how to stand to go pee, so we don't use this for that anymore, but he still uses it to go poo. I think it is a great potty seat for girls. So I will keep it for my youngest daughter."
5,Worked Wonders!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Wow! We have had this for two weeks and she is potty trained. We had tried everything, but this was the one."
5,sturdy product,This was much better than the Munchkins brand seat I bought first. It didn't really fit on the seat right so it didn't get used. This fits perfectly and is easy to clean.
5,Great product,"I bought 2 of Babybjorn toilet trainers since my daughter was one and a half years old. They are great. My daughter love them. They are very stable on the regular toilet, unlike some other brands. The locks work very well, just a little difficult to clean. I just bought the pink one to put at her grandma's house. It's very cute."
5,Sturdy and easy to clean,"This potty seat has absolutely no rough edges. It keeps my skinny 19-mo-old on the seat comfortably. It is made of smooth plastic with an adjustable wheel underneath that allows bottom paddles to extend outward to sit tightly against any toilet seat. It has no fabric, so it's easy to wash with soap and hot water in the tub if needed. It is definitely worth the $$ for a seat that will last through kids and grandkids. If anything, I wish they'd put handles on the side--to hold onto and to prop up books :-)"
5,happy potty trainee on guam,I was so happy to find a toilet trainer that fit my elongated toilet seat. My son is comfortable on it. The open space is large enough for a male child to do number 1 and 2 simultaneously w/out having to adjust his position to ensure pee lands in toilet!
3,Potty Seat,"It does its job, and fits the toilet just find. I don't like the splash protector in the front; my daughter has a hard time with it. This was the very first seat we have tried, so I have nothing to compare it to. I did order another seat that folds for outings and I'm hoping it works well enough to replace this one. I know this seat got really good reviews, and I think for the most part it's great too, but I just can't get passed the big bump in the front."
4,easy way to transition to a toilet,"This was in between the bjorn potty and the real toilet and my son really didn't mind using the big toilet with this. He felt very secure. If needed, it's easy to take on a car trip for other bathrooms."
5,Best potty seat,"Bought the toilet seat for my 2 year old daughter, and when she saw it we ended up using it right away. She wanted to stay on the seat all day. It's easy to put on, to clean, and seems very comfy."
5,Worth the money..........,This is amazing! You don't need to worry about it slipping/sliding around when your little one is on it. We purchased a cheap one from a discount store and it was an accident waiting to happen.I love it and so does my son.
4,Happy with it!,"Overall, I'm very happy with this product. No wonder everybody raves about it!The only feature that needs to be improved are the handles on the sides.This is quite a pricey toilet trainer and it deserves handles."
5,PERFECT!,"I bought this item after reading the reviews for it here on Amazon. I have a less exspensive cushioned princess toilet topper but this Baby Bjorn is SO MUCH better!PROS--Easily adjustable to fit most (if not all) toliet seats.-Snug fit; doesn't wiggle/wobble when climbed onto by my 28lb 2yr old & no worries of her legs/fingers being pinched between the seats.-Ergonomic design; my daughter seems very comfortable on this seat; Much more so than the ""cushioned"" one I mentioned prior.-Would work well for girls or boys since it has a high front side which helps to avoid accidents.-Very estically pleasing.-One fluid piece so it is easy to clean; no grooves, creases, etc. to have to worry about.-Durable; something I can definitley hold onto for our next baby.CONS-N/A ;)I would highly recommend this item. It's worth the extra $10 you'll pay for it over the cheaper ones!"
5,Best potty seat out there,"BabyBjorn has done it again. We have this potty seat, as well as the little Bjorn potty chair and step stool and we love all three products.The potty seat is comfortable and easy to put on and take off. It looks sleek, unlike those unsightly, bright ""character"" potty seats. As a result, I'm more willing to keep this seat on the potty all the time, which in turn helps my son get on the toilet faster, which in turn means fewer accidents!At first I was hesitant to spend $30 on a potty seat, but now I see this product is worth the money."
5,Best Design in Potty Seats for Boys,"We are still in the midst of potty training but this by far has the best design. I have a little boy who is tall for his age and the potty chairs frustrate him and he is scared of the splash guards. This ""topper"" with the contoured design for a splash guard is the best I've seen yet."
5,Great Potty Seat!,"I love this seat because it works on different types of toilets. It does not move around like some of them do. This is the third seat I tried, but just have not been as happy with the other brands. This one is great and worth paying a little more for."
4,Excellent though pricey pink potty seat,"Our daughter has been getting better at warning us when she has to use the potty, thanks to the reliability of this product. As other reviewers have noted, it does not move and is very stable.Pros:- if your child likes pink, your child will like this!- stable adjustable adapter- easy to clean: no soft cushion or other places for urine to accumulateCons:- for the price, it would be nice to include a hook designed to hold the seat, say...one that hangs over the edge of the water tank, or an adhesive mount on the side- no side grip handles"
4,Great potty seat!,"This seat is great - it has a mechanism that fits it to your toilet so it won't rock or slide and is solid plastic construction, so it won't crack like the padded seats do (will definitely last through my babies and can be passed along in great condition). The pee guard doesn't work great for my baby yet (we EC and he's 13 months and small for his age anyway, so it'll probably do better as he grows). He feels safe on it, though, and can sit independently quite well and is similar in shape and feel to his Baby Bjorn Little Potty, so it works for us!"
4,Good potty seat,"We tried a couple of other options before finding this seat. It is far better than other potty rings b/c it clamps onto the toilet seat so it doesnt wiggle around. The others were hard for my son to balance b/c they moved back and forth on our elongated seat. This one solved that problem. It is also more contoured so it seemed a more comfortable fit for him.It is easy to remove and place. We did finally opt for a built in all in one seat when my son started learning to pee standing up because it was even easier to get out of the way but, for just starting potty training, this seat is quite good - a step above the other potty rings."
5,The right seat for our baby!,I love how there is a dial to adjust the seat to fit your toilet seat! This prevents the seat from wiggling and moving around. It is comfortable to sit on and easy to clean! We purchased another seat prior to BabyBjorn and it doesn't compare to this seat! The price is a little high but well worth every penny! I recommend it.
4,All around seat,This potty seat fit on all of my different toilet seats without a problem. My son can sit on it for long periods of time without getting uncomfortable. He's on the younger side at 18mo and the fit is just fine for him. The splash guard could of course be a little higher but we haven't had any major issues with this one. It does what it's supposed to and the ability to adjust the seat for a snug fit is what makes this seat so good. Other seats have slid around and this one stays put.
5,Simple and easy to use,Love it. Easy to clean as the main part of the seat is made from a single mold. The rubber handle is easy to use for a handle or to hang the seat when you do not use it.
4,Tried three other brands before this,"If you have a boy... this is the only one that would fit the needs. We tried three other brands before this one and while they had their own merits, none would understand a boys needs better than this one. Fits perfectly on the toilet and can be adjusted if needed."
1,Dangerous - splashguard caused us a trip to the ER and four stitches,"This potty seat worked well for us until this past weekend, when my son attempted to use it without a step stool. As he was trying to slide off, the splashguard stopped his progress, which caused the skin just above his penis to tear from the pressure of being trapped. He now has four stitches in a very sensitive area, and this was a very traumatic event for him.The splashguard on this seat is pointless anyway, since it's too close to allow any room for the penis to extend, and my son has always had to push his penis down to pee into the potty. A splashguard on the floor chair version seems less dangerous, but on this model, where the seat sits on top of an adult potty, having such a high (and unremovable!) splashguard is just plain dangerous.Parents of little boys, beware."
1,Don't believe the hype,"I'm surprised by the high ratings for this product. My wife and I have been very disappointed with it. The main problem is that the splash guard does not extend down far enough. Every time our little boy uses this seat, the bottom of it is soaked, the actual toilet seat is soaked, the underside of the toilet seat is soaked, and the rim of the toilet is soaked. And no, the problem is not our toilet or our existing toilet seat, because the same thing happens on any toilet we use this on. Very poor design--I do not recommend at all if you have a son. Perhaps if we had a daughter, I would be giving it a higher rating."
2,messy,"I bought this seat for my son because of the built in ""shield"". I have found it's a bit short and also that somehow his wetness deflects up under the seat and gets the toilet seat and underneath the seat all wet. I have to always wipe the actual toilet seat and under the potty seat afterwards. Definitely a big mess. Not what I expected from such an expensive seat. Would not recommend"
3,Doesn't fit on all toilet seats,"This training seat appears to be of good quality but does not fit on all seats as indicated in other reviews. I have a curved seat (Toto soft-close) and it does not fit. I had to send it back, unfortunately."
5,terrific info,"glad I bought the book, helpful and easy to understand ideas that i can use. highly recommend it."
2,Don't be deceived!,"I first read this book when it first came out a few years ago. There was much in it that I couldn't quite grasp such as the concept of the ""Conscious You"" that is introduced here. But a lot of the teachings appealed to me so I decided to accept it all as truth. But after several years of studying the teaching of the Ascended Masters brought through the Summit Lighthouse, I realized that this book has many truths interwoven with subtle lies that actually take you further away from Christ and God.This ""Conscious You"" is a graven idol that is being offered you as a replacement for your Christ Self, and raised up as more important than the I AM Prescence. This to me makes it an anti-christ concept. I love Mother Mary, and it saddens me to know that there is one imitating her and using her to introduce ideas that lead people into the mind and away from their Hearts."
1,Hard to read,Not the easiest to read and has parts that are very suspect. I've studied the Ascended Masters for many years and this book drifts off base.
3,Nice comp of female singers,"I bought this because it had "" To Sir with Love"" and ""Put a little love in your heart. I acquired this before technology changed and now you can just download singles via MP3's. This is a nice compilation of predominately female singers from the 1960's"
3,Mid-20th Century Manhattan Roman a Clef,"The main plot and the lead characters in this mid-Century Manhattan roman à clef are somewhat beside the point. This book's attraction is that the supporting characters are based upon those in Windham's bohemian circle. George Platt Lynes' story is told nearly in its entirety. The most memorable tangent, however, is Windham's deft characterization of a reclusive artist who is based up the enigmatic Joseph Cornell."
1,EDITING,"I regret not checking the reviews before buying this book. The story is interesting but I can't get past the horrible spelling and grammar. Champagne is spelled champaigne, for example. I don't usually check the publisher, but before I buy another book, I will make sure it isn't published by Writers Club Press. I figure if they can't afford to use spellcheck, I can't afford to be annoyed by another of their efforts."
2,Song of the Succubus,"I lost interest in the plot, I was to busy highlighting all the typos in this ""Book"". The author obviously didn't have an editor. Not worth the money I paid for it."
5,Funky and quirky,"Though the movie had quite a surprisingly slow pace, the acting (even Jim Carrey's multiple characters) and the stylised look to it really made it an excellent movie overall.And what really made me enjoy the movie the most was the end credits sequence, where the soundtrack came into its own. An incredibly catchy use of unusual percussive and stringed instruments is used to incredibly creative effect to give the whole film an unusual edge that draws you in.There's a definite Tim Burton-esque quality to the movie, but this music is certainly not like Danny Elfman, so it really helps make the movie stand alone.Highly recommended. The whole soundtrack makes for great quiet background music when you're reading the Lemony Snicket novels."
4,Very Good Music,This is a pretty good album. A few of the songs are tear-jerkers and tear-jerk they will. A very beautiful score for a very sad movie.
4,Hope in the midst of misfortune,"Without revealing too much about my feelings towards the movie, the soundtrack definitely stuck out amongst the drama, crazy characters, and melancholic undertones of the film. It is a picture perfect example of where sometimes the music is so good, it steals the attention away from the film itself. Particularly noteworthy is ""Loverly Spring,"" a cracked-out, hyper-happy ditty about a little elf, and a jaunty rendition of a classical piece played during the final credits, which, unfortunately, seems to have been omitted from the soundtrack. ""Drive Away"" is also ridiculously catchy and perfectly dark for this bizarre film.Well done, Mr. Newman."
1,Such a nice company...think I'll give you this feedback free!,"Am just trying to get an understanding of Hydraulics. Am not interested in writers who are so self-absorbed they neglect the efficacy of employing Semantics in their written communications on a subject, I like to assume, they know what they're talking about. Will look to see if 'Dummies' offers something. Looking for a book to learn from; not something for an engineering graduate to play with."
3,Pumps & Hydraulics by Audel,"I'm not impressed. Units are not consistent and terms (like force and pressure) are interchanged. Much of the material seems pretty old, so I'm not sure how honest it is for them to print the words ""all new 6th edition"" on the cover. There is some useful info, but, overall, I found it to be just an ""OK"" book."
1,Keep looking - the editors should be FIRED!,These people have some nerve charging $$$ for a BETA book. Thebook lists 6 editors plus a proofreader. What the h*ll did thesepeople do! The book is RIDDLED with code errors and VERY poor project layout. You can probably get something out of this if you have the patience to DEBUG THEIR APPLICATIONS.
3,Lots of code examples but needs more explanations.,"They did cover alot of ground for one book. Once they started chapters on the actual data objects, the code becomes laborious and tedious at best. They should have demonstrated each concept with simpler code modules and more explanation. In some of the chapters I had the impression that the authors were as weary of writing as I was of reading. It is a good introduction in the sense that it covers much of the vocabulary and many of the concepts of database programming. I now at least know what to look for in other references. In summary - it covers alot of ground with not much depth. Good for a first survey, but not much good for future reference material."
3,"With some reservations, the book is a good intro.","Besides errors in example code, the instruction is poorly organized, episodic and in my opinion does not focus enough on where databases are moving: the web. Additionally, while the author gives a fairly clear presentation of DAO, the section on ADO is terrible! If you are more interested in learning VB db design the old way, this might be your book."
2,"This book appears to be wonderful, but...","Many of the examples contain errors and do not work properly. Neither of the authors support their web pages, or respond to e-mail inquiries, as the book claims. I am searching Amazon.com right now in order to find better VB6 database books.This book may work out well for someone who uses only Access databases, but it is not very helpful for ODBC users. I would not purchase it again."
3,"Lots of detail, but lots of errors","Although there is a lot of information in the book, many of the examples contain errors that had to be worked around. (Perhaps a little more time de-bugging routines would have been helpful)I have learned a lot from the book, but I would not purchase it again."
2,Database programming with Visual Basic 6,"This book promises much, but delivers little. Both the book and the examples from the CD are so full of errors that it is more of an example in frustration than learning. It is nothing more than a usless piece of garbage"
3,Good Reference Book,This was a good reference book. Especially for the money. I find it helpful to have 2-3 ref. books per language for review in case I need them. Amazon does an awesome job supplying thses type of books at a low price.
3,Everything Yet Nothing,"This is neither a book for people who know nothing about database programming, nor is it a book for experienced programmers. Not sure where it's placed.For beginners it's very difficult to figure out what the author is saying about DAO, RDO, ADO. This is exponentially exacerbated by the fact that MSFT seems to change its mind about the standard each time they bring out a new version of Access.MSFT seems now to have settled on ADO as the standard, so with the bulk of this book focussing on DAO, it's not worth getting. But in reviewing, we must remember that this book was written way back in 1998 - an aeon in programming.I found the line numbering style reminiscent of the early days of DOS BASIC when every manufacturer had their own version. Ah, the days of my old Spectravideo."
1,Not a good book.,"Although the book covers most of the topics associated with VB and database programming, it is riddled with grammatical errors. The source code listed in the book has errors. You will have to decipher before trying to make sense what the author is trying to explain."
2,It needs editing and more comprehnsive details,"The book is not that much of use. Many mistakes embarsed me through out the book. And on the other hand, 21 days is not enought to become a good programmer !"
3,good,"I have read another book on this subject and it had a test to determine what number I am, this book did not"
3,One of the better enneagram books,"I first encountered Helen Palmer's ""The Enneagram: Understanding Youself and the Others in Your Life"" a few years ago and it still holds up fairly well. The Enneagram is an interesting tool for self understanding, and this book presents the nine Enneagram points in a clear-cut way. I found it somewhat disorganized, however, and not partiuclarly well-written. The prose rambles quite a bit. Although there's some good information here, it's sometimes hard to find, and I could think of a number of people who did not quite fit any of the categories, at least as the author describes them. Nonetheless, it led me to learn more about the Enneagram, and I would recommend it to anyone interested in the subject."
4,Sony T33,"This is a nice unit to carry in the shirt pocket. I hate the lack of an optical view, the LCD is NOT convenient for point and shoot type photos. Especially out-doors. This is a special purpose camera and is very good for posed in-door or nature shots. Also, in the practical use of this unit, it is best to crank it down to the 3.2 pxl mode, or other lower res. The close shots at 5 pxl are phenomenal, every detail of a product label for example is perfectly reproduced. Good toy, but I like my DSC-P73 for every day use.UPDATE: 3/08 Still going strong, batery life is excellent, I use it regularly to document daily events around the house, have a date stamped history of baking, cooking, re-model events and renovations. Also have on several ocaisions taken before and during pics of projects that are useful in re-asembly and restoration."
5,Excellent!,This is a fantastic camera. It takes great quality photos and has many amazing features - too many to list. It is very compact as well. Can fit practically anywhere. I highly recommend this camera.
4,Simple,Very easy to operate. This camera takes beautiful pictures outside. The lighting has to be right inside.
5,Love the bag...,"I read other people's reviews and decided to try this bag. Can't say enough good about it. Light, stable, fits in the car good. Handy compartments. Agree the shoulder strap is hard to remove...I've solved that - I just leave it on there. It's a good bag, I'd recommend it."
4,lots of room,"I wish there were photos of the insides on Amazon or Kensington's website. It has more room than I thought it would. The back is especially roomy - it's divided by the handle assembly, bit there's exactly enough room for my Bose QuietComfort2 case on one side and my laptop powerbrick and food on the other side.The inside main compartment has enough room for TWO 15"" computers (although only one would be padded), plus a few folders, mags or paperback books. Based on the ads and some other comments, I thought the styling might be too ""girly"", but it's not. The strap is hard to remove, so I just keep it short and leave it on. I was able to use the strap to attach it on my main luggage for wheeling through the airport. By itself, the handle is a good length (I'm 5'8"")."
4,Small Form with lots of room,"I purchased this roller bag for my wife after having bought a larger, leather roller. She's very pleased with it and it's still small enough for her to pick it up and carry it, if necessary. While the size of the bag is small, it still fits her rather large laptop and all of her papers and peripherals that she needs. In fact, it's slightly smaller than her old, non-roller briefcase that she used to lug around.The only downside is that the bag isn't leather, which might stand up to the weather (snow, rain) a little better; probably not a huge issue, since the underside is hard plastic."
4,Notebook Computer Roller Bag,"Kensington Contour Balance RollerThis is a great, lightweight laptop bag. I was having trouble with my shoulder and back, so I tried this model. It has really helped being so lightweight, and maneuvers well when being pulled on the wheels. There are also several compartments to hold you accessories and files. I would recommend this bag to anyone."
5,I really like it,"A roller that's Easy to carry as well as pretty, and very light. I am a 122 lb woman with neck and shoulder pain, this is just about perfect for me because it eliminates difficult carrying (via rolling) and even if I have to carry, it's well designed for that. I really recommend it. One minus, I had hopes of using it as an overnight bag for the airplane but, Unless you just had a pair of underwear and a toothbrush, it is too small. Not really room for a change of clothes unless you are extremely ingenious. Well maybe."
5,Excellent!,"Excellent computer bag with lots of great compartments and very sturdily built. The strap is a bit challenging to figure out at first but once mastered it becomes very easy. Only annoyance is that I wished the shaft of the handle was made of more study materials (its a little shaky). Otherwise, its an excellent buy with great shipping.BC"
3,What cartoons does it include?,"Hey, Amazon! Am I supposed to guess based on the cover art? How bout a list of which cartoons are on this DVD? Is that too much to ask before I order it?"
5,I love these cartoons,My parents don't let us watch just anything on TV. They screen what me and my sister and little brother watch.They love these cartoons and we boought this and the Looney Toons golden collection. These cartoons are just as good but a lot cheaper and have better colours. I mean the colours are more vivid. It is a great value and we can watch them a lot without getting tired of them.
5,Excellent quality! WOW!!! Great episodes,This is a great buy. We have most of the other DVD products in this category and this one is a great product. There is two full hours of the best episodes on this DVD. Hi highly recommend it. If you want to see what episodes are on this cartoon go to www.starlingfilms.com. I also recommend the Timeless Cartoons by the same company.
3,Bazooka Cartoon Classics,"This DVD arrived in a crushed case. A big piece of plastic was broken off, into the case. The DVD itself works fine but I think the sender should take more time to package the product better."
4,Fun Gift,"Bought this gift as a trick for my parents who adamantly did not want a dog. Presented it as a ""real"" dog and had lots of fun. Mama has named it and shows it off to all her friends."
1,blobs of chocolate,"This item does not work as described. After painting a letter or shape through the stencil, the applied product just runs together into a big blob. Well at least my wife and I got a good laugh out of it. But sensuous? Not at all."
5,Pefect for lovely nights,"I bought this product and I did not expect this much of funIt is tasty, fun, and very niceHope you all have fun with it :)."
2,shaking mirror,"It is OK, but the glass mirror is shaking when the car is beyond certain speed like 50 miles/h!"
3,Cute - not much power,"This is a cute toy for a small child (2). It losses power or gets ""confused"" when pressing the buttons a lot. Note this is not a flying toy."
3,The songs are not in the right order.,"I only have Disc 1. This CD has good songs with good singers, but the songs are not in the order that's listed on the back of the album. They are in reverse order, with 14 first and 1 last. This is ok, except it is strange to have the introduction last. I was confused until I realized it was completely backwards. Just remember this when you label the songs."
2,Fat-Free? Right!,"For those on a low-fat/no-fat diet, watch out! The second ingredient for this product is vegetable oil! So you are getting fat when you use this ""fat-free"" product. They claim a ""trivial"" amount for one teaspoon, but most people use more than a single teaspoon. The taste is fine, but don't call something ""fat-free"" when its second ingredient by weight is oil!"
1,Beware,"I've had this camera for 6 months. 4 of those months have been spent fighting with Sony to service it.Stay far, far, far away."
4,Very good quality camera,"The camera has excellent video quality in low, normal, and high lighting. I wish it had a little higher zoom however trade offs must be made when price is part of the purchase criteria. The only real flaw of the camera is Nero the included software for editing and transferring to the PC. The software is difficult to use and is not the full version. So if you plan on purchasing this camera plan on purchasing some software if you are going to burn DVD's."
3,the Handycam Station is not very handy,"This is a nice camcorder but the Handycam Station makes it less appealing. I have to remember to take the docking station everywhere I travel. What makes it worse is that the Handycam Station is very loosely snapped onto the camcorder. It can easily fall off and disconnect when you try to transfer video/picture through it. The camcorder itself does not have USB or IEEE1394 built-in. All these vital ports are in the Handycam Station. If it were not for this awkward docking station, I would have bought this camcorder."
1,Sound Died on Safari in Rwanda,"Took it on Safari in Rwanda. Shot great video of elephants, hippos, giraffes, etc. Got home, no sound. Imagine my frustration. Camera worked great for over a year, but then on an important trip, the sound stopped recording on the camera. Don't purchase if you want reliability for the long run. Great out of the box but didn't work when I needed it to work."
4,great family mini cam corder,"i bought this camera in april and am very pleased with it. i had researched digital camcorders for over a year, and actually returned one panasonic because it would not work with imovie. this camera is easy to learn to use, takes great pictures and has good sound, and interfaces easily with mac's imovie. you need to buy a firewire to download to a mac computer. don't know about other computers. i bought a longer life battery and a charger, but the one that comes with it is fine also. pictures taken in low light seem to show up fine also. all in all i would highly recommend this camcorder to a non professional movie maker. also amazon makes it really easy to buy everything you need."
5,Not only cute but functional,Cute little shoe that protects kid's toes . . . no more broken and torn big toenails. Seems to be comfortable as she isn't pulling at them all of the time. Definitely would buy again.
3,Leaves a little to be desired,These are cute shoes but they won't stay on his feet. The elastic at the top is too loose. There's no way to fasten them either. I wouldn't buy them again.
2,Beginner stuff,"This is a nice book, but if you are a software developer or system administrator with a few years of experience, you probably already know at least 80% of the information presented, more if you are an experienced Python or Perl programmer. The chapters on WMI and ADSI are only 36 and 51 pages long (to give you an idea).Again, it is a nice book, but it is not ""hardcore"", and the ""user level"" on the back cover should say ""beginner-intermediate"", not ""intermediate-advanced""."
4,New Rammstein album is awesome!,"Well i just bought the album yesterday, and was listening to it throughout the day today. It is a good mix of classic Rammstein as well as a few new musical elements. There is no topping Rammstein's old stuff, i will always love it. However this new stuff is quite good...a good change. I have a friend who is a big classic rock fan, and never liked Rammstein...he was pleased to hear the higher level of talent in this new album, when i made him lisetn to it. Definetly worth buying...Go Rammstein!"
4,The Bad Boys of Deutschland in Fine Form,"I bought this CD with some trepidation because I didn't care so much for Mutter; I found it to be fairly derivative of older bands (Led Zep comes to mind).I've always thought that Herzelied was their best album: it's so raw and Til's vocals are really powerful. Reise, Reise definitely brings back the power that Herzelied evoked (Mein Teil & Moskau are fine examples), but at the same demonstrates a lot more sophistication in songs such as Amerika. In fact, it's pretty clear that the band is aware that they've achieved a kind of international cult status.Very polished and clearly shows a lot of hard work.Buy it: you won't be disappointed."
4,It rocks!,"I have always been a fan of Rammstein but I must confess that this is actually the first cd I have purchased of theirs. Mostly because I love the song Amerika. The song perfectly captures my sentiments about Globalization and the spread of American consumerism and capitalism.Also, it totally rocks."
3,"Ok, but not typical of Rammstein","I absolutely loved the Mutter, Sehnsucht, and Herzelheid albums. Unfortunately, this album fails to deliver in the ways that those albums do. It is decent music, but it sounds like Rammstein has gone soft. (Mein Teil, Reise Reise, and Amerika are exceptions). Reise means travel or perhaps vacation in German. Hopefully, Rammstein is just taking a vacation from their earlier musical style."
3,Ok.,"I liked mutter better than Reise Reise..The songs are to soft and all follow a pattern, they get soft in the beggining then get louder. *shrugs* just my opinion."
2,That is it? This can not be Rammstein.,"True fans of Rammstein can never like this. I listened to it not more than 5 times in the last 2 months. Mutter was good but not even close to their first 2 albums. This is even further away. They should go to thier roots. The style from thier first 2 albums is nowhere near done and no band can do it like they do. So go back.If you guys like this kind of music, give Eisbrecher a try. more electronic but way better than Reise."
5,The cover art is correct,"This album is great. It is the Japanese version of Reise, Reise, which has the same cover art as Rosenrot. With the exception of ""Reise, Reise"" printed under Rammstein. Rosenrot, says Rosenrot."
3,"Eh, thats all I can say","I got into Rammstein a while back, and I've been obsessed with them since. This album is kind of a dissapointment however. I had hopes of this being better than the previous albums (if that's possible) and my hopes were shattered. This is the weakest release to date, and it is the worst CD so far. However, it still has a few good tracks and it's still worth buying if you're really into Rammstein. One big problem, the music seems much to calm compared to the previous CD's. Even the slower tracks on here don't work well. After listening to this, I just expect more. Buy it if you're a diehard fan, otherwise just wait for the next one."
2,Definately no mutter.,"I like Rammstein quite a bit. This cd is ok, but is way below par. Definately my least favorite of their cds. I can listen to it while cleaning or farting around. But if you are looking for something to crank up in your car this cd does not offer vary much past the first two songs."
4,"Not up to ""Made In Germany"" standards","These guys are usually bad ass but apparently they've gone soft in this latest album. True, it does have some awesome songs like Mein Teil and Reise Reise but it also has some extremely lame songs like Los and Amerika. What were they thinking when they wrote Los? They sound like some old geezer band playing out of their rocking chairs. Also, what's up with Amerika? Apparently they broke their promise about never doing a political song and stooped to the level of the typical Euro-whining about America."
3,Rammstein returns....in color,"Not sure if that makes sense, but as good as their previous albums were, most of the songs were either slow or driving. Reise, Reise represents a progression of the band in my eyes. The songs here linger more and arent quite as driving, but are less strained and more colorful. I have to admit missing the driving nature of Rammstein songs that was prevalent on the Mutter album. Ich Will on the Mutter album simply rocked, the best 'driving' Rammstein song in my opinion. Its easy to dismiss the Reise, Reise album because theres no song like Ich Will on it. I think thats unfair to the album however.I have to admit at first listen I underestimated this album and considered it inferior to Mutter. But as I continue to listen to it, I think this album has the most A grade songs on it of any Rammstein album to date.I would rate it 5 stars now, a definitive buy for Rammstein fans."
5,Great CD,"Absolutely great! Every track on this CD is awesome. It's just ""geil""! The lyrics and the music are ""krass"".Now in German: Ich hoffe, jeder kauft sich dieses Album und lernt dazu noch deutsch, dann versteht man die Texte!Und die hauen richtig rein! So, let's rock & roll!"
4,Good cd but,"Reise Reise is a good cd but I didn't care for track three Dalai Lama and track five Los. Rest of the cd though was a very good listen and the songs I enjoy alot. Amerika, Moskau, and Amour are my favorites on the cd. So if your into pop rock music and a few metal songs then pick this cd up and enjoy the music on it track for track song for song time and time again. By way side note your speakers will thump over and over again in your car depending on how loud you got the volume levels in your car. But if your like me you want to blast your rock and metal music or any music you love as high as possible."
5,Just great,I loved each song on this CD and it makes me want to get all there earllier albums. I highly recommend this to all.
4,Different then Before,"For everyone sayings its different its because it is. They wanted to try new sounds. They got some inspirationg from metallica, system of a down, and Slipnot. Still a good cd. Amerika is one of the best music videos ever made I think."
5,A Surprise...,"I had originally bought the American version way back in 2005. I caught sight of this version about a year later. Back then, I didn't think much of it, but after seeing that there were hardly any copies about 2 or 3 months ago, I figured ""what the hell"", and ask a relative to get it for me for Christmas.Surprisingly, I first wanted this just for the alternative artwork, but after seeing the two bonus tracks, they became the main reason why I wanted the album.Just like the original, I loved every song on here. The two bonus tracks are great, and they make up for the flight recording sound not being on (Although if you find the re-released version from 2009, the flight recording is back, along with the original artwork).Take it from me: if you want this copy, buy the few that are still on here."
4,"good, but not there best","This album does rock but I don't think it is there best.They changed there style.The first two albums sound nothing like there new stuff. I still like sehnsucht the best,because I like the catchier riffs. The new album sounds like a better version of mutter. It's still heavy and uses a lot of symphony and violins as backround effects. Another thing I like is the album is melodic.I would recomend this album but if your like me and you like there old stuff dont expect this album to sound old school."
1,Complete disappointment!,This album doesn't resemble Rammstein at all. Where is the powerful guitar riffs I remember from previous efforts. There are way too many ballads on this album. Rammstein has sacrificed its musical integrity for a few potential hits. I mean this album is beyond bad. I would rate it 0 but Amazon doesn't go that low. Anyone who gives this album a good rating clearly hasn't heard their old stuff. I refuse to purchase the next album by this sell out group.
2,(-_-),"I am very disapointed in Rammstein. The facetious song 'Amerika' pissed me off. I want to shoot them for making it. It breaks my heart to see this excellent, one of a kind band sell out like this by bashing America... It's a shame... They bit the hand that feeds them... Totally un-glorious."
1,Whats the appeal?,"I honestly don't know whats so appealing about a bunch of people in a German band (yelling German) leaping about on the moon chanting""We are all living in a america"". When that is of course total lie anyway. Is'nt it ovious,""r u nat tolkin in germain!!!??""As for the music, well is it music, just stupid boring guitar riffs played over and over with ridiculous noises.Whats the $#%#% point of people who are'nt german listening to this anyway, you can't understand them singing, which is one of the whole points of music!!!!!!^%$^$%% rabbich!!!!!!!"
5,another winner,I will never use any other toothpaste. This is the best. This company used to make a excellent cough syrup and hopefully they will bring it back.
5,Creative Hip hop,"Very creative,innovative & well done....the plot story line & cast is fantastic,if you love hip hop you'll love this & if you don't you should be able to appreciate the creativity.Sticky did a great job directing this, Mekhi Phifer,Thttp://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html/ref=tag_rvc_rv_ihlp_wt?ie=UTF8&nodeId=16238571rech,Omar Epps & Clarence Williams were fantastic !!"
1,sucks,"the whole movie is a rap song, should have been labeled a play. didnt like it. i wish it were less rap and more talk, couldve been a classic"
1,Horrible movie!!!,This movie was terrible. It should be a rap video because they rapped their lines throughout the whole movie. I would not reccomend this movie to my worst enemy!!
5,This cd is great if you like the movie or tech,"All the tracks on this cd are great if your a fan of the movie and the music is one reason why you watch it during the fighting parts.even though the acting could've been better the movies are still good.TThis cd is a great colection of techno to listen to if you have to zone out, or write a freaking report"
2,Boring for even a newbie rpg'er,"Although the graphics are quite beautiful IMO, especially compared to D2, the game is, well, boring. With an unbelievably linear story, the game takes very little thought, save micromanaging your party (which quicly gets monotonous and annoying). Think I'll stick to D2...no, the graphics aren't quite as spectacular, but at least it's fun."
2,A Hallway to Boredom,"Boring! Imagine an impossibly long hallway populated with bad guys, doors on either side that have more of the same bad guys. That's what playing this game is like. You have one path to follow (regardless of the scenery change) and every few feet you fight a monster. As long as you load up on health potions (say, half your inventory), you can easily beat this game in a few hours. The fact that you can choose your character's appearance is cool, until you start equipping him/her and the appearance changes with the new armor/weapons/shields anyway. If I knew what this game was going to be like, I wouldn't have bought it. Caveat emptor."
2,Gauntlet 2002... but much less fun than the original,"Only two things separate this game from the pack, really.1: The score. The music in this game really adds to the immersion of the game. This, I suppose, doesn't mean all that much, since the immersion is not very compelling, but without the music it would be abysmal.2: Graphics. DS is head and shoulders above Diablo 2 and Baldur's Gate (the two games it is most frequently compared to).Another review on this site says something to the effect of ""this game plays itself."" I agree. Honestly, the only enjoyment I have gotten from it is listening to the music as my beautifully rendered character walks around a beautifully rendered landscape.Trust me, though... that gets old quick, even with graphics and music as engaging as DS's.My advice: Wait for NWN or Morrowind."
2,Boring,"Talk about your mindless tripe. This game stinks of it. Wander around and mindlessly let your minions beat the monsters. If this game has any challenge, it is because your lost. The miserable overhead map shows you a limited view of where you have been. If you can't find the way through the confusing maze, you're hosed.The graphics are great. If you chose movies based upon effects, you will love this game. However, if you want depth and plot, look elsewhere.Choosing the character class has no purpose. You have enough minions that they just flog everything in the area to death. Very reminiscent of the old game Gauntlet without the fun. The multiplayer game may be more of a challenge, but I wouldn't know. I uninstalled it early in the first player game."
4,Great but....,"The graphics are awesome, very smooth, and very realistic war of fog. the only problem i had was the control especially when controlling different types of spells and switching weapons. eventhough it had the pause feature, switching speelbooks and spells was tedious. And i don't like the way you increase your abilities. You will only be able to increase your skill if you are using it, but it's kinda realistic."
2,"Fun at first, but then you realize it's tedious hack & slash","At first I thought this game was great, simple interface, good graphics and a beautifully crafted world to adventure through. But after playing it for a few days I realized that it was mindless hack and slash the whole way through. No strategy, no thought, just sit back and watch the mayhem, occasionally altering what spell you cast or telling your players to drink a potion. Halfway through the game the only thing that has changed from the first hour of play is the statistics and graphics of the monsters. The storyline is very weak and there is no where to go outside of the one linear path through the game.However, I gave it 2 stars instead of one for the strengths I mentioned above."
4,Best Hack and Slash RPG Ever!,"This game is pretty fun bys yourself but even more fun when you play co-op with some friends. I actually broke my mouse a few weeks back playing this game. It is really fun. The 3d isometric graphics are top freakin' notch as well as the spell effects.If you want a game like Torment, Fallout, or Arcanum. You will have to look elsewhere. But if you want a clickiy game like Diablo 2 but better (imho), then this is where you go."
1,graphic ok but very boring,"when i first started the game,i was impressed by graphic.However, after playing the game about 6-7hours it became really boring, I just did same thing, just follow the road, kill monster,and pick up items. This game is so linear, i don't think this is a good role playing game. Somebody compare this game with Diablo2. That's like insulting Diablo2 game.I am going to play Hero of Might Magic4 which is really great game, until i get the warcraft3.I can't wait to get the warcaft3...........PS:i am not good at English so it may my grammar and spelling is incorrect"
2,Too much hype,"Graphics are excellent. This is the extent of the positive comments I can make about the game.The game is as linear as a game can be.The automatic control of the camera can be annoying at times.Red for health, blue for mana sound familiar? Having different colors for weapons descriptions depending on magical enhancements sound familiar?..."
2,game,I ordered the wrong one as i am not a fan of role playing games. I tried playing but did not find it to my liking. My preference are strategy type games
4,Great game by Gas Powered,"Actually, I really didn't like the game all that well myself. BUT, it's not hard for me to realize that's only because the gameplay doesn't appeal to me, where it would to perhaps most of the RPG gaming world. Control is smooth and intuitive, probably the best I've ever seen in an RPG. The graphics are also stunning and visually appealing. What I personally didn't like about it was the gameplay: to me it felt like constant hack and slash, where your basic goal is to kill scads of monsters and gather loot. And scads of monsters you will get. In my friend's words ""it's the Serious Sam of RPGs."" In contrast, what I'm finding I hold of highest importance in an RPG is the story line. For me, this one just didn't cut it."
3,Not to bad,"Lets face it, Dungeon Siege is not the best rpg on the market. It gets boring at the end and the multiplayer [isn't the best]. One of the things i liked about this game was the multiple members in your party you can control. The use of formations is kind of useless. It had some minor bugs but nothing earth shatering. The only other thing i can think of is the editor that wasn't included. And that problem was resolved when the CGW disk this month gave us and editor.The beginging of the game plays kind of like diablo but when you get another member in your party it's a whole new ball game. Now the game lets you use strategy in your gameplay. The only problem i found with having 8 party members was that they were easy to lose track of at times, but these moments of frustration are few and far between.This is a solid game that any rpg lovin'...gamer will enjoy, just dont expect it to keep you up for more than 3 nights in a row, a week at most.I give it a 3.5."
3,Good to Great to SoSo,"I have been playing for several weeks now and the game has started to loose its freshness.When I started the game play in single player mode it was fun. The new graphics excellent. However, the game just seems to lack the depth of say Diablo LOD.Sure there are mods available now, but no matter what you change it seems like cheating, and the game becomes less appealling.Now multiplayer is better because you can play with friends but you still don't have a lot of replay value once you have completed a map.To end on a high note I look forward to getting some mods that make the game more playable or even write my own because the graphics and camera control is so fantastic. Any RPG player should at least look at this game and the editor."
5,Best RPG Game I Have Played,"I have played through this game twice, once as a fighter andonce as a mage. I love the user interface, graphics, audio andinventory management. This game includes many interestingdungeons and the AI for the monsters is great! I oftenchased one into an ambush, very cool. You will never finda better RPG area then the Swamp, fantastic! Yes, you are kepton the single path but so what? You are free to explore withoutgetting lost and exploring is the name of the game. I completelyrecommend this game for hours of enjoyment."
5,Utima + Dialbo + steriods,"Wow,What a cool game. Totally fun 3d game engine. it has a top down approach but a true 3d world. I love the combat, it is a lot of fun and pretty easy to get the hang of - you can play in real-time game or pause and issue orders. Spells are cool - party system is easy to use.I can't tell you mush about the story yet beacause I havent got that far yet.my only gripe is Max resolution is 1024X860 - I have a geforce4 4600 and a 21 inch monitor and I would like to crank it up more. But graphics are great at that res"
4,Dungeon Siege,"I played this game for a few days now. It's one of the best fantasy games I played make that one of the best comp games overrall, I got this for my birthday and I was so excited.It starts out with you being a farmer you have to kill enemies and you're given missions in the chapters as you go through the chapters you can get more characters into your fellowship. There are different monsters to defeat in all the different dungeons! Shopping is probably the best part (if you have money of course) I like to make them look buff and awesome! The downside is that the music kind of creeps me out and i get sort of tired of the dungeons get lost now and then run out of health potions, i start to get a little lonely, and i spend an hour or two on something that is kind of worthless, but play it on the weekends! Anyway all in all it's a great game have fun playing it!"
4,A good Hack and Slash,"This game for all it's fun, is rather confining. You aren't given the opportunity to rove at will. I really like to be able to go anywhere I want to. In this game you have to go in one direction, fighting a plethora of creatures.The world itself is beautifully done, and the creatures you fight are some of the best around. There was basically no story, you just fight. For those who love a good Hack and Slash, you'll love this game. I found it exciting at first, but then that's all you do. No real puzzles to solve, no mysteries. Oh sure, you have the odd 'quest' now and then, but nothing that really challenges you.I gave this a four star rating because despite the linearness of it, I really enjoyed it."
4,Too short,The game is good but it is too short. I finished the game in three days. I expected it to be a little longer. 8(
1,"ATTENTION MULTIPLAYERS, LAN BASED - NO SAVE OPTION","If you are planning to play this in multiplayer over a LAN you have no option to save. Unlike in Diablo, quests you have completed will not save. Unfortunaly, the nature of many of these quests are interdependent such that you have to go back and complete the quest again EVERY time you play. Unless you intend to play continuously, the game becomes frustrating and tedious very quickly."
3,"Graphics A+, Storyline C-","Fun game, if you like pure hack and slash. Gorgeous graphics, learning-by-doing gameplay, entertaining combat, but way too little in terms of plot and storyline."
3,FUN until you beat the game,"I was amazed by the graphics of the game. I loved the way u can move the camera and tilt it. After I beat the game it's boring. It has almost ZERO replayability. Once u beat it, it's BORING. the multiplayer [is no good]. If you want to spend that much money, buy DIABLO II! It is 100 times better, u have different characters and different skill's and MUCH more items and A LOT BETTER REPLAYABILITY."
4,Hours of fun and pretty easy to follow...,The pace of this game is perftect. Fast enoungh to keep you interested but not laking detail. Play is a bit too linear but I have had several sleepless nights playing this one. Characters are easy to move and command. Money well spent.
2,a warning to AD&D fans,"Ok, the hype got me...but i should have asked a very important question before buying and anyone who is a serious AD&D fan should, does it follow the game rules??, i did not wonder about this and now i am in possession of a game with great graphics an lots of goodies like the reviews say, but it leaves me flat after playing it once, there are no sets or character classes, and the lack of the AD&D ruleset wich other games follow (Baldurs gate, etc) simply takes the fun out for me...guess i will be looking to exchange it with some other gamer."
2,So disappointing,"The fact that this is a Microsoft product says it all - it's a memory-hogging game with a ton of ""ease of use features"" that just serve to make it bland and boring. Oh yeah - it also crashes if you go too far off the beaten path.If you want to watch a demo of nice technology that needs a little interaction from you, this is the game for you. Heck it even fights battles on your behalf.But if you want a fun game, get anything else."
1,"Nice graphics, little gameplay","The first ten minutes of Dungeon Siege was great! Decent graphics, smooth animation, great soundtrack - and then the tedium sets in. A lot of little annoying user-interface problems. Sound effects for creatures that grow increasingly obnoxious. NO story or plot. Gameplay that couldn't get any less linear. Click-click-click-click. Calling this game an RPG is a misnomer at best. I'm extremely disappointed in Gas Powered Games and Microsoft, they could have done so much more. The opening and menu sequences feel quite unpolished. Pushed out the door too soon to beat NWN? I think so."
1,THIS IS NO DIABLO,"I waited and waited for the release of this game. Back last year I waited and then they pushed back the release date to this month. Finaly I got a copy of Dungeon Siege on the day it became available. With all the hype and buzz I thought that I had last found a game as good as Diablo & Diablo II. Was I ever disapointed. Have you ever played Dark Stone? Dungeon Siege is much more like that game than Diablo. But Siege does not even match up to Dark Stone. The graphics are not so hot, combat is dificult after you get three characters in your party and my bigest complaint is that the game plays so dark you can't even see the bad guys your fighting against! In a number of battles I found myself killing the mini-boss or boss and not even knowing it until after the battle was done!The one good feature is the pack mule. But a pack mule does not a good game make. In the end Dungeon Siege is nothing special...I guess I'll just have to wait for the real thing..."
3,Diablo 2 but fancier,"Dungeon Siege falls somewhere between Diablo 2 and Baldurs Gate 2. You find yourself as a farmer who's village is overrun by monsters. You start off with a knife, you fight monsters, you find better weapons/armor/spells and than repeat. The graphics are amazing though, and as you get more members in your party the combat complex. Microsoft really should have spent more time on story, you'll usually get to a town and be on the road again in about 2 minutes after. But if you enjoy fast paced games with good graphics and just enough story to keep you happy you should buy this."
3,Looks amazing... but suprisingly vacuous,"So many people have already reviewed this game, I'll keep my comments short. This is the best looking top-down view RPG you're likely to play right now. But under the hood it has tired old RPG mechanics which I lost interest in quite rapidly.If you can enjoy any RPG regardless of the mechanics or repetititiveness, you will enjoy this game. For me, Dungeon Siege was all style and no substance, and I got bored and never completed it (which is exceptionally rare for me)."
3,hightech_not so fun.,"i have a pc that is above average ...(radeon 7500,p3_1ghz,512mb_w98se)but this game is aimed at higher hard ware . BUT.i'm having satisfaction with my pc ,so far becauseradeon 's hardware TnL is paying off ,i guess.graphics,effects ,sound and music are well built BUT!you should not expect diablo style quest . nor should youexpect other rpg's fun.Unless you go to internet or tcp/ip and play with kicking and alive team members .Yes, not the AI team members you will meet.you will meet new teammembers(AI)as you play on but they aren't as active ashuman team members.the story is quite simple (tasteless)and i hope people with powerful hardware(cpu,vga) try this gameIF they have friends willing to play together.i'm waiting for the expansion(if there is any comming out).so people who do not have good hardware, wait untill you upgrade your pc and then buy the full set.people who have good hardware but don't have friends to play with, go for other games.great technology with lesser taste."
3,"Great game, but doesn't run on every computer","...When it comes to the game it is pretty much the same as Diablo, but better. There are more weapons, awesome cloths, shields, boots, glooves, caps and helmets, rings and amulets. If you like Diablo, this game is heaven. If you don't like Diablo, you will still enjoy Dungeon Siege , as my cousin did ,and even when there isn't a plot, the chapters are so good, you don't want them to end. The way you gain experience is much better than Diablo and the fact you can choose the way your hero looks is also pretty satisfying. You will not get tired of playing the single player game, and when you do ( and get to be a wizard, knight, and archer), you will spend hours on the net playing.If I had the opportunity to choose between Dungeon Siege, and any other game I would stick with Dungeon Siege. ( unless your choosing among Neverwinter Nights, and Morrowind :Elder Scrolls), which I still haven't had the opportunity to completely evaluate them."
4,Great First timer,"I have played alot of D&D back when dirt was young. Since then I grew up, had kids of my own, and watch them play D&D games that had whole different rules then when I played.I was truely unimpressed with many of the computer games to date, many were too difficult to understand how to make a correct character or were first person shooters. This game takes care of that yes it is somewhat mindless going from monster to monster but where this game exceeds is the multiplayer.I enjoyed the scenery and the point of view, the large map and the zoom on both. The game itself has some merit but the story line is thin.I am sick of first person shooters, I hope this game will be enjoyable to you as it was for me."
3,This game aint for me.,"I bought this game for a bargain 15 dollars, it is a good timewaster, but it isnt for me. I like rpgs with depth, this one might be good for newbies, but not me."
2,To much of a good thing,I understand the developers desire to create an expansive world with lots of magic items to find but in the case of this game it became overkill for me. I seemed to spend half of my time just trying to figure out where I was and where I had already been since the overview map was useless for this task. Another quarter of my time was spent sifting through a hundred inventory items trying to figure out which ones my party members could use and which ones were better than each other. In the end pretty graphics couldn't overcome the dread I felt everytime I got lost or came into town with a filled inventory.
4,One of the best RPG's I have ever played!,"This game is like another version of everquest, with no monthly fee and an offline play system. however, i would like more than 8 players in a group, and more variations of monsters."
2,What do people see in this game?,I bought this game because every web site and gaming magazine rated it extremely well. I played it for 10-15 hours trying to see what the allure was. I just don't get it. It just seems so stupid. Your fighters bang on the baddies while your magic users launch one of the same 3 or 4 spells over and over and over again. I play ALOT of games and this is one of the worst ones I have played.
1,Dungeon Siege,"Sucky game. Really wasn't good.OK that's all I was going to write, honestly, but I'll add this. Though no one will ever read it....The game is titled Dungeon Siege very aptly. Like a real siege, it's drawn out and extremely dull involving cruel amounts of suffering without end and with no lapses or breaks at all.Not to even consider the literal aspect of laying siege to a dungeon. What moron would ever lay siege to a dungeon?! its below ground, full of monsters, cramped, and dangerous. A simpler solution would be to roll a heavy stone in front of the hole and call it a day.ALSO: in soviet russia, dungeon sieges you!Now then, in practicality, I don't suggest the game. Seriously, I wish I had spent the time staring at a post."
2,"Fun for a while, then gets really B-O-R-I-N-G-!","What a disappointment. After 2 years of waiting, I finally get to play it, expecting another masterpiece from Chris Taylor. Instead, I get this pretty dungeon hack. Boo! Even Diablo 2 had a story in there, somewhere."
3,I bought it for someone else.,"I have never played this game; I bought it for someone else. They like the game, that's all I know. It's fine, I guess."
4,A good way to waste a couple of days.,"Nice graphics & sound. Slight issues with Windows Vista, but overall a fun game to play. I've been playing for almost 13 hours and don't even think I'm halfway through the game yet."
1,This is soooo DULL!,"I would like to write more, but the game just put me to sleep...Go buy some grass seed, plant it, watch it grow... much more fun then this game..."
1,"Too easy, too short, D2x still rules","The graphics are gorgeous, gameplay is extremely repetative, and it crashes every 5 minutes. There is no patch yet, and the promised Siege Editor still isn't available. I finished the entire game in 17 hours and there isn't much replay value as every encounter is identical every time you play. You can have my copy for free if you stop by and pick it up."
1,YAWN,"I really should have listened to the diablo comparison. This game is beautiful, but DULL. You go through the motions with little input. It is not challenging and there is no point. If you enjoy fighting battles just to watch characters gain levels then you will love this game, but if you wanted story, background and interesting characters and subplots you had better keep looking. Beware the long poetic reviews on any board, they are almost all written by employees of the games mfg, part of their PR departments offical job."
1,Dungeon Seige,"A total waste of 50 bucks! The graphics are GREAT, but the game is DULL! All you do is fight, then fight some more, and in-between fights, you fight some more. The quests (what few there are) are absolutely BORING, and you spend all your time fighting."
3,Works fine with my AMD/VIA chipset,"One review stated ""don't buy if you have AMD"" - I have a 850Mhz Duron processor on an ABIT KT7-RAID (VIA chipset) motherboard. The game runs as sweet as can be with 512 MB of old PC100 RAM and a little Radeon 8500LE 64MB video card. Check your RAM, graphics card, and shut off everything but explorer and systray. Don't blame AMD or VIA.The game. Well, what can I say, it's amazing and beautiful, but I was bored with it before I got halfway through. Nothing much happens except killing monsters and picking up loot, and there is still a lot of fiddling around with inventory when you transfer appropriate gear to the right party members or worse if you ressurect more than one and they pick up the wrong stuff (happens A LOT!) since they drop everything when they die.Warning - Zero Plot! But otherwise, a great game."
2,"Kill, move on, kill, move on, kill sommore....","If I might throw in my two cents worth: While this is the general nature of all RPG's of this sort (hack and slash, collect gold, find the bad guy/gal and kill them to win) I find the barrage of enimies thrown at you to slaughter on each level tedious to say the least. Just how many Krugs/Lurkers/Spiders, etc. do you have to off before they are all dead? A dozen monsters is okay. Having to kill off three and four dozen on one level is ridiculous and boring. Oh, look! Another dozen to kill before I can move another 25 feet! I'll grant that I am only in the end of chapter two (Chapeter two and already I'm getting bored!) so I hope it will get better."
3,"Can You Say ""Diablo 3D""","This game is a decent clone of the well known Diablo series, to put it bluntly. It may boast 3D graphics and having a full party (instead of controlling one character) but it is lacking in dynamic gameplay. The character development system is reminiscent of Ultima Online, where you gain skills depending on which skills you use the most. However, the problem is that some characters advance WAY faster than others. Also, the game is too easy. Like Diablo, it doesn't take much experience or thought to play, it is fairly mindless. I would say, if you can borrow a friend's copy, go for it...but don't buy."
2,Great condition,"Showed up on time, great condition, worked flawlessly. Just one problem, I didn't like the game. I never really grew up with PC games like most people did. I grew up with Atari 2600, NES, SNES, etc and my family was not PC savy enough to get me a PC nor did we have the capital so I missed out on, what are considered, great PC classics, like this one.It's a phenomenal game for PC, I just didn't like it."
5,Great Adventure Game,"I thought that Dungeon Siege was an excellent game. I am by no means a first person shooter player & prefer games that have a little strategy & thought required. Although this game is linear, meaning you follow a certain path to conclusion & can't deviate away from it (very much any ways) you do have to do a little creative thinking when it comes to launching your attacks on various enemies. (some can be quite tricky) The story was entertaining, the graphics were great, and it held my attention beautifully. No ADD issues with this game!! Would recommend this game to anyone that wants to play a fantasy/adventure without all the running around with just a gun on the screen shooting anything you see."
1,"Beautiful interface, boring game","This game has one of the most elegant and beautiful interfaces I have ever seen. Perhaps the best the role-playing industry has ever seen. Unfortunately, the game is boring. I can't believe that so much work went into the interface of a game that is so bad.Just look at a screen shot and pass this game over. It is way overpriced and destined for the bargain bin."
5,Breathtaking - 5 Star Plus!,"This RPG is FUN and very addictive!The music and environment are so emmersive I get cold when I walk into the Northern towns and ichy when I run through the swamps. I have started to dream in DS, when I actually sleep that is.The gameplay is accessable you don't need to read a manual to figure it out. There are tons of hidden areas to explore on and off the path--forests, ice caverns, swamps, towns and of coarse dungeons and if you want to stay alive you will have to have a stratigy and develop your melee, archor, nature or combat magic skills. It gets harder as you get stronger.Im addicted, gotta go!Cheers"
3,Another lure for the newbie RPG gamer....,"This game, form what I have seen and read, has nothing special about it. You cannot choose what character you start off with, just your gender. The only classes you can choose from are fighter, archer, and mage. You can play online, but players can make their own maps thus opening the possibility of game makers buffing up their own character to no end and slaughtering everyone else... This game also promises to be very versatile when it comes to character classes... you can be a fighter and a mage and an archer at the same time... this sort of ruins the overall experience in my opinion. I cannot even believe the other post of this game rating it 5 stars and going by nothing more than the hype on the official site...."
4,A Fun Fighting-Based RPG,"This game provides hours of gameplay in which you battle everything from little dog-like creatures to skeletons to dragons. It starts you off as a farmer and depending on what weapons you use (bows, swords, or spells), you increase in that skill. You can combine the skills even to be, say, a healing mage who fights with a bow. Along the way you pick up companions who work in the same way, and you also recieve quests you can complete. Add this to a rich story full of dialogue and you get a great game. The only problem I have encountered is that you can't carry very much stuff, so you have to selectively choose what you want to bring with you. You can, however, have a donkey as a companion to carry your stuff. Also you can pause the game whenever you like, making the use of strategy quite possible and almost unnavoidable."
2,"Where is the role playing? Whack, whack, whack","If it claims to be role playing, I think of Baldur's Gate, Gothic, Morrowind, Neverwinternights. I think of discovering a universe with history, gods, esoteric knowledge, intercultural conflict, interesting and useful treasure. Dungeon Siege pretends to have such things but really just leads you through a variety of landscapes while you kill everything that comes by, and pick up randomly generated objects with ridiculous or irrelevant attributes. I found the game a waste of my time and money."
3,Dungeon Siege is cool!,"This game is really great, if you are into rpg's that allow you to build up your character class and skills, like fighters, mages, wizards, and archers. Equip your fighters as you create a male or female character, give them a name and send them on a journey from a humble farmer to a great warrior and goblin slayer!There are quests to do and you will be notified once a quest is completed. Allow other character to join your party and equip them, and keep those health and mana potions handy!"
3,Boring....,The mule is cool. Arcanum players will appreciate the mule. You can get a herd of mules to follow you around. You spend your time whacking critters. If you like mules and whacking critters.... this game is for you. If you want any kind of plot line or NPC dialogue go elsewhere. BG or Morrowind come to mind. I'll give it 3 stars because the graphics don't .... and it almost makes it as a first person shooter game.
3,Nice atmosphere - tedious gameplay,"For the real hard-core RPG party micro-managers out there this game will provide hours of diversion. However, if we step past the beautiful graphics and dynamic music, we stumble into a game of linear boredom. The problem with RPG's like this is that the myriad of level upgrades and weapon/spell choices completely overwhelm the majority of gamers. YES, the environments are lovely and the pack mule IS a good idea but ultimately the 'click attack' and 'constant checking of health bars' becomes really tiresome. It's a pity, because Dungeon Seige does attempt to appeal to the more casual RPG'er.Overall, a solid and commendable attempt at appealijg to the non-RPG'er. At a budget price it's well worth a look."
3,Too easy,"This game was ok. There is really not all that much new here that has not been done by ID software. The camera-view system in my opinion did not work. There where definite times during the game when this view system made it very hard to move your party around and fight. However, I did like the fact that you were not forced to be a single class. Which ever skill you used is the one that you leveled up in. So you could be a combination of a magic user that could also carry a sword and fight very effectively. The main reason that I gave this game three stars is the view system. I just did not like it."
2,Dungeon Siege,"Im this close to never buying another game with microsoft stamped on it ever again. Welcome to single player Diablo. It was fun to start with but quicky becomes boring. The story is dull and the interface is clunky, and you CANT PAN UP. Do yourself a favor and buy a game with some replay value, this game has none."
2,"Boring, repetitive, no brain game.","This game is essentially Nox with a team instead of one player. Nice graphics, but [bad] game if you want something even mildly cerebral. Fights are predicatable and monsters are REALLY dumb, even on difficult. Best for no-brainer ""I just feel like knocking stuff around"" time consumption or younger kids that prefer a simpler game. Eliminating micromanagement of battles, weapons, etc. can be a relief and is decently done."
2,Good story boring features,Great story line and thats about the only good thing this game has. Its graphics and game play is nice but managing a group of 3 people gets to be a pain and character appearance is mediocker. There are only few spells and two different types of spells and stats are done for you as you progress. The spells should change or become more insteanse as they level up not stay the same as a puny ball. Melee atacks are good but its hard to level up sometimes to get the stats to use a found weapon. Overall this game gets 2...
2,could have been much better,"i bought this game just a few days ago and i thought it would be something grand and spectacular. it was all hyped up to be a great game. music and enviroment were spectacular. game was fun though for about an hour. then it just got extremely dull. the plot of the story is rather mundane and mediocre. the whole rags to riches theme used all over with trials and boring adventures in the middle. does not have the free flowing movement which other games of the genre do have. baldurs gate is of the few that come to mind. if you are looking for a game within this genre stick with the baldurs gate series, icewind dale, or wait for neverwinter nights. other games to look for are in the ultima series and diablo series as well."
1,This game islame,"This game only has its graphics going for it. Besides that the game is boring. There is not must to the characters and it is completely hack and slash. It reminds me of diablo, except I thought diablo is better than this game. Don't buy this game, wait for neverwinter nights."
2,Dungeon Siege. How to make a game boring,Dungeon Siege is the right game for you if all the interaction you need is to click once the mouse button and them go to get a coffee.
1,Don't buy if you have an AMD chip!,"I got this game for my brother, who installed it on an AMD Athlon 1.4 ghz system. The game INVARIABLY causes the computer to hang. Tech ""support"" says that this ""should"" only happen with VIA chipsets, however, I know that my brother's is a SiS chipset. Further, tech ""support"" suggests that the best fix for this problem is to upgrade the BIOS (prompting most people to require a NEW COMPUTER--Flashing the bios is not a solution!)This game is a totally useless waste of money, and I am going to try and return it to office depot, regardless of their open software policy. DON'Y BUY IF YOU HAVE AN AMD CHIP!"
2,dungeon siege,"Cool graphics , the map [is bad] You can't see where you've been unless you back track or mark it out as you go on paper."
2,What a terrible piece of slop,"Not only is this game linear, dumb-downed and boring, but its graphics leave something to be desired.I dl'd the demo just to check it out and was highly disappointed.I recomend Neverwinter Nights for the fan of any RPG of high merit."
3,Great music but...,"As a recording this is 5 stars, but I'm deducting 2 stars because of the misrepresentation of the product. Of the 22 tracks, only 9 of them are solo guitar. The other tracks have an accompanying guitarist, piano, or in some cases, up to 4 other players! The music is excellent, but it's unethical to purposely deceive the consumer by naming a CD ""The Solo Sessions"", when more than half of the recording is ensemble playing."
4,NHJ Portable Wristwatch TV,This wristwatch TV is a very attractive product but I doubt whether anybody would actually wear it on wrist as it is bigger than any other wrist watches available in the market.Unfortunately the TV reception standard used is NTSC(my country uses PAL) and hence the unit is unable to receive colours and sound.I would like to know whether anybody could suggest an NTSC to PAL converter which would enable the TV to receive colours and sound.My attempts to collect some technical information through the technical support team failed also falied as my emails bounce backed from the given tech team's Id.
2,Not reliable,"I've been using this type of tv for over 2 years at my job, use it 20 hrs a week and it's good and the reception is decent (except ch3&5 that I can't get), but in 2 years I had to buys 5 tv's because there is always something that fails every 4 months or so, out of 5 tv's, 4 chargers burned out, 4 tv's burned out, 4 earphones stopped working cutting the sound and the reception.I have to keep getting this tv, because it's the only one concealable enough that I can keep in my pocket, so that everyone at work thinks I'm using a small radio and won't complain, I can't wait for a new portable tv to come out early 2009 that will work with the new digital system.And I found out the first time around that NHJ is no longer so there is no warranty."
4,To cute to pass up!,"It is a cute little gadget, not always a super picture. BUT when it is tuned in, it is awesome for being so small."
1,Awful,"This Wristwatch first of all is big and bulky. The reception and quality is terrible. Also, i could only get up to four channels out of the 69 it says is available... I wouldnt recommend getting this..."
5,great picture,I got this tv watch a few months ago off of overstock for $60 i was just expecting a little gadget that wouldnt do much. I have to admit i was wrong this tv watch gets a great signal i get all the channels its looks and sounds just as good as my sattelite tv. Even when i go 20 miles outside of dallas i still get a crip picture you can see everything that you would on most tvs. I also have too add that this watch is very durable i have dropped it a few times and accidentally kicked and it still works fine. There were two things i did not like about it one is that the its a bit bulky and the other is that occasionally falls out of its wrist clip. Other than that i have no complaints i would consider it a great purchase and it definately worth the $99 on amazon as opposed to the original price of $240.
4,Inexpensive and Effective VoIP Headset,"This headset works well with USB attachment directly into laptop or desktop for VoIP calls, WebEx conferencing, and for all audio. It has only one earphone but the sound is clear and ample (I am a multi-decade drummer/percussionist and motorcycler so my hearing is probably below the average for testing the sound volume and clarity). The 2.5 mm attachment also works well with my cellphone. It would be nice to also have the 3.5 mm plugin, but that does not come with the base unit - just the 2.5 mm and the USB. I highly recommend this headset as a cost-effective solution to VoIP and general audio output for laptops and desktops."
4,Nice HeadPhone - Comfortable.,"I liked this headset a lot. Its says 3-in-1 i.e it works with cordless phone,mobile phone and PC (via USB).For me , it worked only on the cordless phone and USB.I talk for long hours still it is very comfortable.I did not give it 5 stars since it did not work with my mobile phone.I can hear the caller's voice but caller is unable to hear me."
1,headset hums at higher volumes,"this headset is very disappointing. setting the volume above the half-way mark results in an audible hum. increase the volume and the hum becomes a significant distraction. thinking that the unit was defective, i contacted plantronics customer support, but was told that this behaviour was to be expected.although it had the features i wanted and is compact, i recommend looking for another headset."
1,Beware of the second rudolph movie.,"I was hoping to obtain the Burl Ives movie that I enjoyed so much as a kid. Unfortunately, what I received was a lesser quality different animation directed by Max Fleischer (from about the same time period) (30 minutes - Goodtimes Kids Klassics - not!)). I wound up throwing it into the trash to avoid further pollution of the better Rudolph. Luckily, I only paid two dollars for it used.If you are looking for the same one you remember as a kid, make sure you receive the Burl Ives version."
4,Cute little story,"This was a cute little version of the Rudolph story, a very old classic by Max Fleischer, famous for his great cartoons. The littlest kids liked this one better than the traditional stop animation."
4,Finding the Stimulating juice inside you,"This tiny little book comprises of a suspense of eye-popping and mind boggling thriller of great inventors, what incite their inventions and how these inventions have literaly shape the world we live in today. The contents of this book will challenge you find out that there is more in your thinking tank than you can ever imagine."
4,very good book,"I am reading 'Juice - The creative fuel that drives world class inventors' by Evan Schwartz. The book gives insights into how creative people come up with inventions by creating possibilities, pinpointing problems, detecting barriers, applying analogies and embracing failures. The stories about how some of the inventions came about are really interesting. Schwartz goes inside the minds of some of the greatest inventors, delves into their stories and explores how they thought up their inventions"
5,Delving into the stories behind classic inventions,"Juice: The Creative Fuel That Drives World-Class Inventors is a remarkable history that explores the minds of some of the most prolific and innovative inventors in history and living in the modern day. Delving into the stories behind classic inventions as well as the people behind current innovations, whether in science, mechanics, or business systems, Juice strives to understand the fundamental keys to creation - such as learning to channel chance, embrace failure, think systematically, and more."
3,Simple syringe for my biology lab,"This was exactly what I expected to receive, and works perfectly for a biology lab. Basic, simple, easy to use item."
5,absolutely superb,discriminating readers will not be disappointed with this novel. it's a wonderful old-fashioned tale; bennett has a terrific sense of humor about his characters and life. marvelous period detail. i also highly recommend clayhanger.
2,Does this author even like his characters?,"Reputedly, Bennett wrote this books after seeing an old woman in a restaurant and wondering what her life must be like. But, it appears he didn't trust that her life would be interesting enough, so he introduces a sister who lives a far more wayward life. As a result, he produces two different books welded together precariously by this sisterly relationship.The two sisters' stories are interesting enough (although he should have stuck with the stay-at-home sister, she's more interesting and believable). What wrecks the books is Bennett's condescending, smug attitude towards his characters. One feels that he would cross the street if these ladies ever deigned to cross his path. His snide comments about their actions and habits quickly grow tiresome. One can only hope that he ended his life alone in a garret tyrannized by the hired help. His characters deserved better."
2,Not the color shown,"This item would have been a four star if the glass were the white-wash described. Instead, it is almost an orange color, giving the chandelier a completely different feel. It is already installed, so we're making it work; however, I would have purchased something else had I known what we would receive. Also, the uplights do not sit completely straight, so the bulbs are visible at certain angles. Worth it for $40, which is not what I paid for it ($110). Think twice."
1,Burned-out!,"I bought this vacuum in March-2004. The motor just burned out.(June) The vacuum repair shop in town said that is very common for this brand and type (bagless)in this part of the country. We live in the desert southwest. He said the sand is so fine it by passes the filtering systems, ends up in the motor and burns them out! He said replacing the motor would be a waste of money, becasue it would happen again. What a waste of money!"
1,Worst Purchase Ever!!,"I loved this vacuum at first. It picked up everything, and even though it was very heavy I was happy. After about 8 months it stopped working correctly. I noticed it wasn't picking up anything and would quit in the middle of vacuuming. The hose got clogged after every cleaning. I was spending more time cleaning this thing out than I was actually vacuuming. After a year I am no longer able to vacuum an entire room without it quitting or plugging up. This is the worst product I have ever purchased!!! I am wishing I had my $50 WalMart vacuum back!! I am going to buy a new vacuum this weekend so I can finally clean my house."
1,Junk and poor customer service,"Had Item six months never worked right, talked to Eureka service serval times, what a run around, I will not deal with eureka again because of poor customer service and poor product. Thanks Bob (sbksports)"
1,"It's ain't heavy, it's my vacuum","I hate this vacuum. I've had it for a little over a year. It started out ripping my Persian rugs to shreds but now, in its (apparently) golden years, I can't pick up a clump of cat hair unless I feed it in by hand. It's heavy, it's unwieldy, and it's worthless. The motor runs fine. Hose only, it sucks. But it doesn't clean the floor. As for cat littler, its specialty seems to be making it ricochet in all directions. It is about to become a curb ornament."
5,Great vacuum,"I thought everyone was total dorks writing in about a vacuum; however, I now understand the excitement. This vacuum works great! It is pretty quiet, easy to use and not too bad to clean. The first use is the worst because it picks up ALL the crap that has been deep in your carpet."
2,Esoteric Subject,"Very short read, but very challenging and specialized vocabulary. Interesting for anyone with a monastic curiosity. Informative about Orders of Catholic clergy."
4,good gift,"I purchased this book for a friend who speaks of the value of silence. She used this little book as a devotion each day, and loved it."
3,A Time to Keep Silence,"This little book offers interesting insights to the monastic life. However, the author tends to overuse French and Latin words and phrases without translation. I found that annoying but am glad that I bought the book."
4,excellent,"Anyone who, on a journey through the world, can stumble into the Trappist world and both embrace, respect, and absorb the difficulty has got to be worth reading. That he has such a fine eye for detail and a range of knowledge (especially about architecture and theology) only adds to the pleasure. Highly recommended."
4,A Time to Keep Silence,"I only wish the book had been longer. The writing is engaging as always, and this book gave a fascinating glimpse into the Benedictine world. The bit about Cappadoccia at the end (which I was very interested in, don't get me wrong) felt a bit ""tacked-on"" as if they needed to fill out a slim book.Very well-written, and I liked it, but again I wish it had been longer and in-depth."
2,What is included?,"Amazon does a better job than anyone else in providing information about DVD contents. That being said, is it so difficult to a least list the movies that are in sets such as this? In this case I would think AMC would want to provide that information. I never order ""pigs in a poke"", but quite often I see sets such as this that, if I knew what was included, I would probably buy. Amazon, as good as you are, this is an area you could improve substantialy."
4,HOUSE BY THE RIVER Review,Loved this movie. Jane Wyatt was fabulous. The storyline and the visuals were right on. A movie along the lines of House of Usher or Seven Gables with some good surprises.
3,"It works, but it feels weird","This attachment works just fine. However, it feels very, very strange to be using it because it does not lock on or otherwise actually ""attach"" to the Door Gym. For the first week, I kept staring at it expecting to fall. Now, I don't think about it. If you need to do anything on the Door Gym with a wide reach (and if you are trying to develop quality lats, you must use a wide reach at some point), this is a good solution at a good price."
3,Get some superglue,"The foam grips slip around the bar itself...not back and forth, but AROUND the bar, so every time you hang, you slowly slide off, unless you have a superman grip or something. I'll have to put some superglue underneath the foam."
2,Did not feel secure,This product was well made but did not feel secure with the way it is used. It just lays on top of the Door Gym with no phycial attachment. Did not feel it was safe to use.
4,Rise to a new height!,"Absolutely fantastic book! Perfect for the platform shoe lover - especially me! Features the author's collection of platform shoes - including non-wearable novelties - leaving you wanting to own every pair on the pages! Divided into 8 chapters including ""Novelties"", ""Sling backs"" and my favourite - ""Ankle straps"". There are shoes with sculpted heels, beaded uppers, springs, wheels and every kind of fabric available. Also shown are the rare and hard to find products with pictures of platform shoes printed on such as record covers and even a jacket. Brilliant pictures, little text, not very informative but a good read all the same."
5,looks just like factory part,"This automatic or power mirror fit great and looks just like it came out of the factory, everything fit perfect, 100% satisfied."
1,Are you kidding?,"When I first started woodworking, I bought a twenty dollar Forstnet set and have used them for years. Now many of them are burned and unusable. I figured I would throw down some bucks for a quality set. Unfortunate for me I chose the CMT brand. I had a 1 1/8"" size in my cheap set that was never used and did a side by side comparison of the same size of the new set I just bought. (Chucked into a drill press, drilling into red oak) The chinese bit drilled a hole with only a small ridge at the top of the hole, faster, with less effort and less heat buildup. The CMT bit produced a significant ridge at the top of the hole, more effort to plunge into the wood, and the bit was hotter after drilling. I then stroked the cutting edge of each bit with a diamond sharpening stone and tried again. Each bit performed better, but my chinese tool still stood higher in quality. I returned the CMT's. Got me some Freud brand, their new Precision Shear. Good stuff."
2,"Corbett's writing is superb, this biography is boring.","The author has done an amazing job of making an exciting subject boring. He appears to have done his homework, digging into the family history back several generations. This, in fact, is the problem with the book; he's done too much research and can't bear to edit any of it out. The first half of the book passes without any tiger being stalked, and that is all Corbett is famous for. The only portions of the book with any drama are those hunting tales he re-tells from Corbett's own books.He also spins in a tremendous amount of speculation about the motivations of Corbett and his family members and friends. He tries to support these speculations with his research, but it's largely unconvincing.Don't waste your time on this book."
1,Too many contradictions??,"Good job in gathering some of the photographs published in the book, butthere are far too many contradictions in the text, a sign of writig in haste.The cover design for the original hard cover was good, but the Oxford reprint, the paperback edition, without any illustrations, looked pathetic!"
4,Home-Style World Music,"The strings on this cd are artsy and groovy. The music reminds me of ""Watson & Co."" who used to play Houston art fairs, but with vocals. 900 Miles has a great coffee house sound, but has more variation with the world music flair. The pair are great together. Her voice is crystalic yet very real to believe. This is a good sound to sit and visit with a friend by, or reflect in the story the cd tells by itself."
1,"TIVO is Great, Tivo support from Phillips is BAD!","I agree with the previous person posting. TIVO is great, but the customer service experience was Awful! TIVO tried to handle the problem by not letting us talk with Phillips directly. Claimed they lost the unit, lost the credit card, credit card was expired (it wasn't), etc. It was like the 'dog ate my homework' excuse everytime and then they said it was 48 hrs before they could get us an update. 2 months later, We finally had our unit back Friday, but by Sunday the TIVO service shutdown because the serial number was unknown to the computer. Had to wait until Monday to fix it! Buy Sony instead."
1,It's great (when it's not at the repair shop),"I absolutely loved my Tivo, it was great until the modem stopped working. Needless to say, I spent a loooong time on the phone with customer service. I found out then that after I gave them $99 and paid for the shipping they could fix it, so I thought. It came back yesterday, I hooked it up and sure enough, the modem works. Now, I have a new problem. It freezes up during the set up procedure. I haven't called customer service yet. If you really want one of these, I would recomend that you pay for the Tivo service on monthly basis for a year or so until your reasonably sure it won't die, or don't pay for it at all and use your recorder like a regular VCR by manually setting the time and date of shows. Most of all, read the negative reviews, for some reason, I didn't and now I'm paying for it."
1,Tivo needs some work,"I think the product is a fine idea, but of 2 units purchased, both proved defective; the first had a large number of artifacts in the picture; the second alternately lost sound or picture after operating for about 5 minutes. The frustating thing is you have to go through the entire setup (measured in hours) before you can see if it will work. Tivo is a product whose time has not yet come- I doubt I will try a third. I got one of the first Replay TV units-the remote control was poorly designed and the unit was noisy-at least Tivo solved that-if they could only make it work!"
3,Hardware and software lag far behind an excellent concept.,"One month and two TiVo units later, it is my firm conviction that Phillips hardware and the software in it have major flaws. Both my original and replacement Phillips units froze frequently. When this ocurred during set up, the entire two hour process had to be repeated. When the unit operates properly, the benefits are as advertised. Unfortunately, the quality of the hardware and software do not match the excellence of the concept."
2,"inferior ""live"" tv picture quality","After connecting the Tivo system and waiting the three hours for the download I was so very dissapointed. Watching live tv through the tivo system produces a less than perfect picture. In essence, the system is always recording the signal on the hard drive so that one can pause, rewind, etc. Therefore, one is not watching ""LIVE"" tv but rather a recorded signal. I own a sony wega tv and the live tv signal through the tivo was terrible. Grainy, less than sharp, almost like a vcr recording. I am returning the system and will hope that the future brings to us a perfected system."
2,Beware!!,"I have a cable system that has an A-B switch. Tivo does not support this. Their solution is to decide between using Tivo on ""A"" or ""B"". And when I wanted to switch, it took a 2 hour set up. Also, if your system requires a cable box you probably wont be able to watch another channel while Tivo is recording. (you would need another cable box or cable tuner of some sort)"
1,Good concept - bad execution,I have a 30 hour TIVO unit. It lasted 4 months before the modem fried and sent me into customer service hell. Phillips needs to use better quality components and better quality service reps.
2,My unit has been replaced three times!,"I have to say, in general what the unit does and the service is pretty incredible. Set up wasn't too difficult ( dish network ) just a bit time consuming. Problem is after 2-3 month the units modem fails to work. It cannot dial into tivo central for programming data. It has been a real frustrating situation - setting up 3 units, having my tv majorly distubed after sending back the damaged unit and waiting for a replacement. and the fact that you are so spoiled with this that when you dont have it it drives you crazy! :-) Im giving up on the phillips unit at least in my case and going to try out a sony unit. perhaps Ill have better luck.. Also have to say the 50 minutes on wait for a tivo troubleshooter is a bit irritating to say the least - try doing it 4 or more times...."
5,TiVo's a must have!,"This product is really amazing. It's totally changed the way I watch television. The interface is really easy-to-use and intuitive. I've used a Replay box before and found it's interface very limiting for a power user. TiVo's personalization scheme actually works pretty well. Once you have rated shows, the box started recording all sorts of things that were interesting. Setup was really simple.I can't wait to see what the company does next with this product."
2,You may want to wait to see how long these units last,"I was an early adopter of the TIVO technology in December 1999. I agree with the positive things that other reviewers in this space say about it. It greatly enhances TV viewing. However, my unit only lasted about a year or so before it died. I guess there's something wrong with the modem inside it. It no longer downloads program information. Without that, it will not function. After several go-rounds with TIVO ""customer service"" (they say there must be something wrong with my phone line, but I say my phone line still works fine and nothing has changed), I've just decided to stop using it rather than replacing it. The ""lifetime"" fee I paid when I bought the unit apparently only applies to my unit's lifetime, not mine. I don't want to pay another ""lifetime"" fee and buy another box, which might also die after a year or so. You may want to wait for a while to see how well made the units are."
1,"Tivo is always on, turns me off!","I'm sorry to say that I would not recomend this product. I was very exicted to get my Tivo but four days after the two hour set up, my Tivo died. Tivo was great about replacing it, but even my second one seems to crash a lot. I am not a computer expert but mabye one reason is because the Tivo unit is always on. I was so surprised to see that there was not even a power button on the unit. Mabye because it does get a chance to rest is why I have problems with my Tivo. I think I will put the Tivo in the Kids room and try another brand."
1,Good concept but too many problems,"This works and does pause tv. But there are too many problems. The first, is that it takes too long to install. I am very good with electronics and took me 3 hours to install not including the setup. The second, my screen would turn blue and I couldn't do anything for about an hour. This happened about twice a day. And the worst problem is that it would change channels on it's own and there is nothing i could do about it. This product is not worth buying and is too much of a hassle."
5,TiVo changes everything about TV,"Never sit through another show you don't like. Never miss an unannounced new episode of a favorite show. Never miss another bit of dialogue. Save a wishlist of favorite actors, directors, or any keyword, and TiVo will search them out continually, any time of the day or night. Once it's set up, there is always something on TV, ready to watch. For busy families, TiVo makes the cable bill worth the money again."
4,Can't Live Without It Despite Flaws,"The TiVo is an incredibly addicitive invention. Once you have one, you won't be able to live without it. The ability to pause and rewind live tv shows, and a program guide that lets you record every episode of a partiular TV show, ensures that you will never miss anything on TV again. However, be warned before you pick up one of these gems. If you have or plan to get Directv, get a TiVo w/ integrated Directv or an UltimateTV system. Additionally, if you have a cable box, you might have problems getting the TiVo to work with the box. The TiVo needs to have full control over changing the channels in order to use all of its features. Additionally, you will need to pay a monthly fee to activate TiVo service. Despite these problems, you will find yourself willing to work a few extra hours a month to pay for the (...) monthly fee -- after all, you won't miss your favorite shows with TiVo at home."
5,Once you start using it you won't be able to stop!,"Its hard to put into words how great this product is, or how much time it has saved me. I now only watch TV at night, and I only watch what I want. I'll normally record five or six shows a day and watch what I want before I go to bed. You also no longer have to fumble around with confusing VCR recording instructions. The ease of use is the best feature, ANYONE can use this, it is that simple."
1,modem blows up,"i was in love with this product, it was the best thing since sliced bread, except i paid 400.00$ and the modem blew up in less than a year. even with the waranty phillips wants over 100.00$ to fix it that is not including shipping which would cost maybe 30 or 40 dollars more. dont do it buy a different brand."
1,not for everyone,TIVO works for some but not for others. The TIVO system is not compatable with the DISH NETWORK better receiver that operates on an FM signal instead of infared. Also it is not compatable with all TV sets and in many cases the signal is not as strong as it is without TIVO. TIVO's advertising is misleading in that they tell you that it records 14 hours. The reality is that it only records 4 hours at a quality that is as good as normal TV reception. My suggestion would be to wait till all the bugs are worked out and the hard drive capacity is increased at an affordable price.
3,"Excellent product, questionable hardware","I've had this Philips box for the past six weeks. Actually, I've had THREE in the past six weeks.I love the product... but the modem inside is not of good quality. Three units, all three modems died. ...even with reasonable electronic filtering (surge/spike).The modem is a critical part of this equipment, and is used to update the television schedule.Be warned... should the modem die once, it will probably die every single time, and you will NEVER be able to use it unless you purchase a a separate, third party ""wireless modem jack"" for about [$]."
5,It Will Change the Way You Watch TV,"I've had my 30-hour TiVo now since last summer, and it just gets better and better. It's easy, the picture quality is great, and the content provided from the TiVo service is worth much more than the $199 lifetime fee. I've gotten to the point where I consider it a real pain to actually have to record a program on the VCR.I got a sneak peak at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas of the newest version of the TiVo software, which is due to be downloaded to every subscriber free of charge this summer, and it takes the ease of use and flexibility factor to an even higher level. And with TiVo's partnerships with the pay cable folks, DirectTV, and now Blockbuster, this technology certainly looks poised to take off. Add to that Sony's announcement of a lower priced 30 hour machine, and it looks like it will get more affordable as well. I have this Philips unit, and it has performed without even a hickup since I set it up."
1,1 in 33 failure rate,"My husband gave me a Tivo for Christmas and we loved this product. However it turns out that the technology is still in a developing stage. The Tivo died this week with a green serious error screen. Phillips has a 90 day labor 1 year parts warranty so for $99 plus shipping they will send a refurbished unit. This is very expensive considering what we paid for the unit just a few months ago and considering that the refurbished unit will carry the same very limited warranty. I would not buy this product without an extended warranty because these units have a 1 in 33 failure rate in the first year for the hard drive and also a high failure rate for the modem. Otherwise wait a few years for a new manufacturer, more developed technology, or better warranty."
2,Beware of Modem Failure,"I LOVE Tivo. When I travel out of town, I miss my tivo more than I miss my family. Everything about the Tivo service is spectacular.Now, onto this Philips Unit. I purchased it. It worked. 18 mos later the modem died. I spent 12+ hours on HOLD waiting for Philips to help me with my ""problem"" and NEVER spoke with anyone. I emailed. I called. No Philips contact to date. I've done my research, however, and have learned that this is a typical issue for Philips PVRs. Sadly, the modems fry. In fact, it's not surprising to have to get a new modem for it every year. Bad bad bad. So. I'm done with Philips. I'm paying more for Sony. Why? B/c I just tried to call Sony support as a ""test"". Guess what? I spoke with a real life person within moments!Goodbye, Philips! Forever!!Long Live Tivo!!"
2,A good ideas but ...,"Three TiVo's later I've finally ordered a Replay TV. The TiVo is a fine machine, when it works, but is hobbled by one of the flakiest and most trouble prone modems ever attached to a piece of consumer electronics, and a system of setting up and customer service that takes 45 minutes just to find the time of day. Living in an apartment building with a noisy phone line I had the good fortune to burn out two modems, each lasting about 48 hours. When my third machine turned out to be already registered to an account that had been suspended I gave up and ordered the Replay.Still -- while it worked it pointed me in the direction of some great movies.Great price too ... luckily Circuit City tell me that Phillips will take back any returns, no questions aksed -- maybe they know something we don't?"
5,OTC 7158 hub locknut wrench,"This hub locknut wrench worked great, fit perfectly. The specs did not include my truck but the one called out for my year didn't work. If anyone is looking for a wrench for a 1997 Ford F350 4x4 this is the one you want for the removing the front wheel hub bearings."
1,wrong tool,i orderd the bearing locknut socket for my 93 ford f150 the tool that was sent to me looks like the picture but was wrong for my truck the tool that was sent was for an 83 gmc 1ton pickup vary disapointed because the part number thats on the tool is the one thats on the screen with a wrong discription
5,Bluegrass music full of heart and soul.,"This CD of Dale Ann Bradley's ""Catch Tomorrow"" is filled with a variety of Bluegrass music straight from the heart. Bradley's voice is soulful and genuine and the fiddling by Michael Cleveland is as good as any ever heard. Highly recommended."
2,Buy the Water color School instead,"The title of this book is misleading it says its equal to 1 year of water color lessons. The book is divided in ""days"" of lessons but all that it does is explain water color techniques wich take about half a page then proceeds to show you examples of his students and explains each and every one of them in incredibly boring and painful detail. I already read about half of the bookand find it lacking as a learning guide. This book is only good as a compendium of Watercolor techniques and methods, if you skip all worthless reviews wich are about 3/4 parts of this book that is..."
4,Watercolour Class. Michael Crespo,"An excellent book for a watercolour 'student'. Lots of very useful exercises, well organised. Recommended by my art teacher as a book which covers all areas, and it certainly does. Examples are mostly of Michael's students work so they are appropriate for the learner to study."
3,okay if you like dirty watercolors,This was a big disappointment...especially after reading all the reviews. I gave it 3 stars only because some of the information presented was useful..otherwise I would rate it 2 stars only. Most of the watercolor examples in this book use black [not payne's grey]...so they are dirty looking with poor color control...yuck! I was going to use this to teach a college class....but not after seeing the images. This book would not set a good example for students unless they were told most of the images are examples are of what NOT to do!
4,A Nobel Prize????,"Well, it's easy, nice, light, just like Polish writer Sienkiewicz - novels by him were very easy, nice and light. But remember - he recieved a Literature Nobel Prize!!! That's what ""New Day"" is!!1"
1,deceptive advertising,"Look at the top of this page and what do you see? A picture of four little bowls together. imagine my surprise when only one little bowl arrived! Wouldn't you expect a set of 4? (And wouldn't you want more than 1 little prep bowl?)Returning this little sucker would effectively be paying for it twice, after paying for shipping both ways. so I kept it. A week later, I found a set of 3 same sized bowls which seem better made AND have lids at TJ Maxx. Price? $5.99.In summary, this bowl is nothing special, overpriced, and deceptively advertised! Don't waste your money."
2,Nice sound.,"They sound great, hold in tune very well, but my high E string broke after less than a week of use. I Do a lot of alternate tunings on my acoustic, but nothing out of the ordinary. As a matter of fact, I was adjusting to Eb when it snapped. I may have received a bad batch but I'm pretty sure I won't be purchasing these again due to the price I paid and the amount of time they lasted."
4,AMAZING,i loved this item! it was amazing! the melody was nice and the harmony was to die for. go buy this right now!
5,Excellent sound,"THe speakers were easy to installed. The wiring was simple and was a direct replacement for the old, blown speakers. The gave excellent performance."
3,An introductory (maybe too much) book,I was looking for a simple book on systems thinking and this is definitly it. However I find it in many cases too simplistic. It mixes hard and soft system thinking without enough care for the origin of this separation. If you are interested in system thinking you can start here but certainly not stop here.
2,Not sure this really works for managers,The book is just a bit too off the mark for me. Didn't clarify ST- just muddied the waters. Not recommended.
3,Useful As A Quick Reference,"This pocket guide is useful as a pocket guide. That is, it provides a wealth of quick summary information on a variety of core topics in the systems thinking domain. If you already have a good grounding in systems thinking, then paging through this guide will be a good refresher. Without a prior knowledge of the material, I don't think this guide provides enough detail for application.In terms of recommendations, this would be a good tool to refresh an experienced systems thinker or as a companion guide to a student using a more in-depth textbook."
4,Systems Thinking Made Understandable,"Haines gives an excellent explanation of systems dynamics. This book makes systems theory understandable, practical, and easy to apply. Haines provides models, tools, and explanations that help the reader put systems theory to use in personal and organizational development."
5,10 american girls from history,10 american girls from history is a must have!!!!! its about women mostly from the 1700's it is very educational.It has long stories and i think it's great for kids.have fun reading it!!
5,Superbly Suspenseful and Horrifying Read,"Don't miss this book! Usually I do not like horror books because of the amount of gore, but this book shows how an author can create a truly disturbing atmosphere with very little blood and/or violence. The tension builds from the first page, as Walter and Colquitt confront the new house built next to theirs and the seemingly random series of very unsettling events associated with it. Ms. Siddons is known for her use of descriptive language and displays this talent admirably here. Each word seems to have been carefully chosen to evoke certain emotions in the reader. I felt drained and reflective for days after reading this. Again, don't miss it!"
5,Good book and social critique,"I enjoyed the creepiness of this novel and the social commentary underneath it: the idea that nothing bad should happen in upper middle class suburbia and that if it does, the well to do just MIGHT have to stand up for their principles for once. Anne Rivers Siddons makes these thematic points in the novel.I found one of the best things about the book is that I was wondering what would happen to MY family if we moved into the house next door. Every family has problems, secrets, and struggles. The impending horrors of everyday life is the best horror, in my opinion. The premise is a fascinating and truly scary one. I wish Rivers Siddons had written more novels like this one! I like her others, but I enjoyed this different type of book from her."
4,Haunted House in the 'burbs,"I enjoyed this novel, and disagree with the reviewer who stated that it isn't spooky or scary and doesn't deliver at the end. I actual continue to see the last scene in my mind, over and over. That is the mark of a good ending.Are there problems with the book? Yes. Some of the situations seem dated, and maybe not as shocking to me if I had read it in high school. BUT, the way she used the frame of the book to tell three separate stories which do tie together at the end was very good and allowed for a different kind of character development. We see the main characters change as they see events next door.I read this book right after Shirley Jackson's masterpiece of haunted house books, The Haunting of Hill House. While Jackson's book is better, I think Siddons holds up well in comparison. I especially liked the idea of a MODERN haunted house. Nice touch.All and all a good, if not difficult, read."
2,Boring!,"I really did try to finish this book, but could not. Others just might like it, and for the authors sake, I hope so."
3,Suspenseful read,"I didn't have high expectations for this book so the starting point at the inception was quite low. It certainly was no Stephen King horror story but I found it to be interesting and compelling. The premise of the book is a family who are living securely in a neighborhood with an idyllic setting, when a house is built beside of them and their secure little world becomes rattled. With this house come a number of inhabitants who all undergo tragedies. At first the neighbor chalks it up to a coincidence but then it happens each and every time a new family moves in and each time it is decidly worse. It was creepy for sure and I agree with the other reviewer who said it was unbelievable, but at the same time most horror/scary things are unbelievable. All and all it was a good read and I'm glad I happened upon the book."
2,Not what I expected...,"I went on a search for haunted house novels and the title for ""House Next Door"" popped up and after reading some 5 star reviews I thought I'd give it a go. One of them mentioned never sleeping at night, but I have to disagree. This book kept putting me to sleep.If I had to quickly sum it up, I'd say it was about a neighborhood of the rich who had their martini drinking lives turned upside down because ""bad"" things started to happen. (In fairness, #3 was pretty awful.)I'm sure it could have real promise, but I honestly just wanted to get this book done and over with. I felt the ending didn't follow through well enough. (I wish the thing with Kim would have been explained more.)Sadly, I'd never recommend this book for any of my horror/haunted house loving friends. Not that it makes a bad story, but it's not exactly one for the genre."
5,My First Siddons Novel,"A friend suggested that I read Anne Rivers Siddons' books. I started with 'The House Next Door', and I am HOOKED. What an intense author... her books grab you and hold you until the very last page. The reader enters Siddons' captiviating worlds, and you don't want to leave. I am now starting my third Siddons' book. I don't think you can go wrong with one of her novels. A++++++++++"
5,Horror with class!,"I've read this book so many times that my copy is falling apart. I enjoyed getting to know the well-drawn characters -- the way they meshed and interacted was fascinating to me. The author got the job done without gross ugliness and shock. Proves that a house doesn't have to be old and full of bats and cobwebs to be scary. I even liked that the ending was not the usual burning down of the house, or ritual to appease the spirits, or wholesale massacre of all the remaining characters except for one gibbering madman."
4,The House You Can't Forget,"In this story houses don't have to have previous owners to be haunted. Anne Rivers Siddons suggests, like Shirley Jackson, that some houses are intrinsically evil and able to prey upon the weaknesses of unsuspecting humans. No motive is necessary, only the opportunity.The story is a little dated in its setting (Atlanta in the last third of the 20th Century) but story of the house along with the author's discussion of the worth of a small, graceful life, merits reading. The story is well-paced and the suspense tightens inexorably. This is not a story of gore but treachery, human weakness and how difficult bravery can be."
4,Not my usual book but very good,"I would never have picked up The House Next Door because I do not read books about the supernatural but when I heard of few remarks about how good the story was I figured I would take a chance.The title pretty well explains what the story is about ... The House Next Door. Walter and Colquitt lived a pretty quiet life. They had good jobs, a nice house, and friends. That all changed one day when the empty lot next to their house was sold and a young couple was going to move in right after the new house was built. Right from the start strange unexplained things were happening and Colquitt and Walter start to believe that the house is ""haunted"". Of course, all their friends thought they were crazy and they were suddenly the outcast of the neighborhood. The House Next Door is a page turner with just the right amount of suspense so you wont get too freaked out."
4,"Great read, lousy ending!",I couldn't put this book down. It had my full attention and then...the ending fell flat!I think the author ran of creativity!
3,Not her best,"I really like A.R.S., and although this book kept my attention for the most part, I found parts rather tedious. It wasn't ""oh my god I can't sleep"" creepy, but actually creepy in a way it was almost believable. The ending, however, left much to be desired. It was like she got tired writing."
3,Entertaining Novel,"I enjoyed the story line. It was not riveting, but entertaining and relaxing. Which is exactly what I was in the mood for at the time."
2,Disappointing,"Anne Rivers Siddons is one of my absolute favorite authors. The first book I read by her was ""Homeplace"" and I went on to read everything she has written. The only one I didn't like is ""The House Next Door."" I do enjoy a good horror novel now and then, especially Stephen King...but he and I didn't see eye to eye on this particular novel. I think Ms. Siddons is at her splendid best when she sticks to her usual genre. In fact, I wish she had been the one to write ""Scarlett."" That would have been a real page turner!"
2,Didn't like it,"This book wasn't awful but it just wasn't that good either. I have to admit though, I am biased because I like ghost stories and this book is about a haunted house, so I was of course expecting ghosts. Nope. The whole evil presence thing was just not enough for me. And I HATE IT when authors feel it is necessary to kill pets. Isn't there any other way for the author to make it scary? It just feels cheap. This book is definitely not a keeper."
3,Not as scary as it could have been,This had a great premise to the story but never really got off the ground. Very predictable.
2,seriously!,"this book made me glad to have lived my entire life in new jersey. luckily, everyone in the south is not this boring and pretentious. even their names are obnoxious. do people like this really exist? that would be the real horror.don't bother."
1,disappointed,"This is an early book. Siddons did write a scary book, but I did not like that it was so unbelievable."
5,Worth every minute!,"From beginning to nearly the end, I couldn't put it down. They give up their work, friends, and nearly their sanity to save anyone else from what entity this house may hold. A little slow to start, but WOW, once it picks up during the first chapter... you're in for the long haul. As for the ending, well... it doesn't allow me to sleep well at night (or go house-hunting for that matter). Invest your time in this one!"
4,The House Next Door,"This was the first Anne Rivers Siddons book I read and I did enjoy it. It was a scarey story about a plot of land that was developed (the last one in the neighborhood) and anyone who lived there had horrible things happen to them. Three different families lived there and things escalated and got worse. The closest neighbors, the Kennedys, were aware of each family's problems starting with the first couple who built the house. They also befriended the architect. With each move a different neighbor got involved with the new owners and they would also get sucked into the nightmare happening. It was never explained why this was happening and it had to be stopped or would keep happening. This story kept you on the edge of your seat until the end. I would recommend it to anyone who likes suspense along with the paranormal."
5,This is my favorite book,"My Side of the Mountain is my favorite book! I read it 50+ times!! It's about a boy named Sam Gribley. Sam runs away in May to live on his Great-Grandfather's farm in the Catskill mountains. On the way he makes friends with a weasle, Baron, racoon, Jessie, and a falcon, Frightful. Read this book. You will love it. I guarantee!!"
4,The best book of its kind!,The book On the Far Side of the Mountain is an instant classic. This book keeps me on the edge of my seat. When Sam loses his best friend and greatest survival tool it looks like that is all the book is going to be about. It turns out that Sam learns to survive all over again on new places of his mountains. He also learns how to use a sling (like in David and Goliath). Then when his voyage was complete he found himself in a mess of criminals and thieves. Read it!
5,My Side of the Mountain,"This is a must read book. If you like adventure and survival books this is the book for you. My Side of the Mountain was written by Jean Craighead George. Sam Gribley and his pet falcon Frightful live in the Catskills Mountains in New York. They make their home out of the center of a big tree. Will Sam be able to survive? Will they be able to find food? Read the book to find out. There are two squeals to My Side of the Mountain. They are, Frightful's Mountain, and The Other Side of the Mountain. I haven't read the two squeals but I'm sure they're great."
4,A Fantastic Book for Kids,"My Side of the Mountain by Jean Craighead George is a very exciting book. The main characters in my book are Sam Gribley, Frightful, and the Baron Weasel. This book is about a boy who is tired of living in New York and runs away to live in the Catskills Mountains and needs to learn to live in the wilderness. While he lives in the wilderness, he meets many new friends. He learns to live in the wilderness and use natural resources. But then people learned about him and then a problem started to sprout for Sam. If you like action and adventure this is the book for you."
4,My Side of The Mountain,"Dear Jean Craighead George,The book ""my Side Ofthe Mountain"" was a great book. I can't believe how Sam had survived from the forest. I loved how you described the details about the forest and everything that Sam did. The food recipes were good.Sam had a falcon named Frightful in this story. Was this story true? What a wonderful adventure!"
4,Tony's review,"Sam's parents never let him go camping, so Sam ran away. Sam use to live in Delhi, NY. He went to his grandpa's land in the mountains. Sam burnt out a giant Hemlock Tree and lived in it. He made a bed, snare, deer trap, deer skin coat, deer skin door, and deer skin underwear. Sam got a falcon named Frightful. One day, Sam heard sirens. He hustled to his tree and saw a stranger was sleeping by his tree. The stranger's name is Mr. Bando. Sam became friends with him. Mr. Bando was a songwriter. He sang great songs. Sam said,"" He liked them"". Sam made a fireplace to keep him warm. In winter, trees were freezing and falling! Will Sam live through the winter? I recommend My Side of the Mountain to all readers, because it is adventurous."
4,Shelby's SOREING Review,"Sam, a 13-year-old boy, wanted to live in the mts. near Dalhi, NY, off the land of his grandfather. His parents let him. "" He will be back soon,"" they said. They knew he would be back in day or so, but he wasn't. He wanted to remain for a whole year! So he attempted to pile wood. He made a house in a tree and collected food, more wood, and sassafras for tea. He worked on this for a couple of days and soon finished! He shared his tree with a chickadee he called Barometer. He lodged by a rock that had a weasel that he named the Baron Weasel. Sam caught a baby falcon ,so he could train her to get food. He named her Frightful. About two months later, Sam met a guy named Bando. He was a teacher. Bando and Sam spent Christmas together. A year was almost up. Will Sam make it? Will he stay? You will have to read My Side of the Mountains to find out. I recommend this book to all readers, because it is suspenseful and exciting."
4,My Side of the Mountain,Sam is a boy who ran away from home because his dad said he would never last two days in the wild.He wants to prove his dad wrong so during the night he leaves home and heads to the wild.This is a good book for someone that likes books that have a deep thuoght to them.I would recomend this book to anyone that likes any book.It always fits.
3,My Side of the Mountain,"I liked reading My Side Of The Mountain because it was about a boy who had a dream and he actually went and lived out his dream. It was interesting to hear about how Sam taught himself how to survive and live off the land by himself. Like when he needed a container, and he used a tree stump and burnt it out. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys adventure stories."
3,Will Sam Survive?,"I liked this book because I didn't know what was going to happen next. The book told me about the dangers in the Catskill Mountains. My Side of the Mountain is a great book even if the reader is a little confused at first. This book is about a boy named Sam Gribley who runs away to his Grandfather's old farm in the Catskill Mountains from an overcrowded apartment in New York City. He is tired of the city life and wants to find a new way to live. Taking with him a penknife, and a hatchet, he sets of into the Catskills. There Sam lives in a burnt out hollowed tree, eats deer, crayfish, and rabbit. He meets many people that help him survive in the mountains. He makes many human friends and animal friends as well. But then he must survive a harsh winter in the Catskills. Will Sam survive? To find out read the book My Side of the Mountain by Jean Craighead George."
4,A fabulous book on survival,"I just finished Jean Craighead's book My Side Of The Mountain. It was an excellent book. It was about a kid who ran away from house in New York to live on his own. He is trying to find his grandfathers old land he used to own on the Catskill Mountains. If you like to read adventure books,and survival books then check this book out. In my opinion this is one of the best books i have read in a long time."
4,a good book,"I read the book my side of the mountain by Jean Craighead.this book is about a yong boy named Sam Gribley who runs awayfrom the city to live alown in the Catcills Mountains.Sam Gribly goes through many changes while living in the the book my side of the mountain in the Catcills is very diffrent from the city where Sam used to live.The city is crowded and busy,in contrased the catcill mountains are calm silent and peaceful.sam can no longer buy clothes from deer hides.i feel that the moral of the story is this that if you try hard enough at something it will work outI think that everyone should read this book because it makes you think about how hard it is to live in the mountains all alone.if you are like me and many others you will like this book because i think everone has thought about runing away from home one time or another."
4,Book Review,"Okay, this is technically a book review for my homework from academy. This fantastic book is about a young boy named Sam who was tired of city life. So he runs to the mountain with a penknife, a ball of cord,some of flint and steel, etc. He tries to find Gribley Farm, which is a farm that Sam's great grandfather made. So later, he finds a giant nest with one egg in it. Then later it hatches and a baby falcon comes out and Sam takes him and later turn friends. Sam now meets new people and learn new things and has to survive storms and etc. This book is a 4 star book and I recommend you to have this book on your lap in the next 24 hours after you read this review."
2,Sam is Stupid,"I think Sam Gribley is a stupid kid for runing away from home becaus there are lots of kids that dont even have homes or familys, and a story that is telling about a kid runing away from home couled incorig other kids to run of and thats not a good thing so I give this book a 2."
3,Readers (adult) really have to give themselves to the story,"As an adult, I found ""My Side of the Mountain"" slow,unrealistic, naive, and all those other adult things, but I canremember reading a number of books of this survivalist/naturalist genre as a child and being utterly enthralled. I believe that this is a book that will turn many children's imaginations in a direction hitherto unthought of. It will also serve as a healthy safety valve to release some of children's pent-up desire for freedom through their friend Sam."
1,boring book,"I did not like this book because I thought it was boring. I like action much more than peaceful books. If you are the kind of person who likes slow, peaceful, detailed books then this book is just right for you."
4,My Side of the Mountain,"I gave this book a 4 because I thought it was interesting, and Sam had many great adventures in the wilderness."
2,The Unexciting Side of the Mountain,"I thought that this book was boring.It basically only talked about Sam Sam Sam! and nothing else like what was happening to the wildlife throughout the changing seasons, if it died out, if leaves changes colors, if flowers beagan to grow etc.. I also think that this book was very good at explaining little things like a tree. Example:wide short hard and rough dark black brown many leaves etc.. I don't recommend this book to people who like exciting books, but to people who don't."
4,TIFFANY'S PIONT OF VIEW,"HELLO, MY NAME IS TIFFANY AND I AM HERE TO TELL YOU ABOUT THE BOOK MY SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN. I LIKED THIS BOOK BECAUSE IT TELLS YOU ABOUT THE DANGERS AND EXCITEMENT ABOUT THE WILD. IT TELLS YOU THINGS YOU NEED TO KNOW AND FIND IN THE WILD AND WHAT TYPES OF FOODS TO EAT. IN THIS BOOK SAM USES A LOT OF CREATIVITY AND I LOVE A LOT OF CREATIVNESS. I THINK THIS IS A GREAT SOURCE FOR CAMPING, OR IF YOU WANT TO LIVE IN THE WILD LIKE SAM."
1,My side of the Mountian,I think that the book was about a rich boy in the city who ran away from home to get attention. I also think that it would have been better if the boy was injured or killed in the woods. If you like storys about a kid going into the woods and nothing happens you will like this book. If you like books about a kid going into the woods and it is like real life get another one. In this book no animals attack the boy or any thing like that.
1,Horrible book horible horible,This is a horrible book!!!!!!!!!!! don't read it it will scar you and your children for life!!!!! You will never get your kids to read another book again untill they're 789 years old!!
5,A book that I still remember 20+ years later,"I read My Side of the Mountain over 20 years ago. I remember it fondly and still regard it is a book I would enthusiastically recommend to children. Through it, I was able to escape to Sam's world, feeling as though I were the one who was living the adventures and spreading my wings. It is a book I am going to buy this week so that it can live on my shelf as well as in my heart."
5,I read this book first in the 5th grade and I still love it,"I reccomend this book to anyone who loves the outdoors. This book describes the adventure of a young boy who risks it all and runs away from home to live, and survive, in the wilderness on his own. He uses his determination and his knowledge of nature to keep himself alive and comfortable on the side of one of the Catskill mountains. If Jean Craighead George didn't actually live this adventure I will be very surprised. A supurbly written book!"
4,A Fifth Grader's Point of View,This book has a lot of adventure and excitment. I would recomend it to somebody who has an open mind and is very adventurous. Once you start reading you can't stop because it always has a new adventure in the next chapter. I think I could surrive in the wilderness now that I have read the book.
1,Boring book ever,"Two years ago my friends and I read this book as a group project for our reading reports. We were all so bored with the story and couldn't finish it in time for when our project was due because of the billon pages of pure trash. I think the author is great but this is one of my least favorite books. Also, if you don't like reading long books then I don't think you would want to read this one."
1,The worst I've ever read.,"I'm not much of a complainer about books, but this book was just simply dreadful. It put me to sleep. I mean, who wants to know how to start a fire ? This book had a pointless plot, a stupid storyline and the author wrote like this: Then he did this. Then he did this. Then he did this.DON'T GET THIS BOOK. IT'S THE AUTHOR'S WORST!"
1,It was boring!!!!!,I decided to read this book because my friend said it was a really good book. Boy was she wrong! It took me about 2 weeks to finish this stupid book and I usually read boods in three to four days! So a boy runs away and makes a place to live in. . . WHO CARES????? This book was dull and boring and I can hardly remember any details of this book anymore. I don't even remember the boy's name!!!
1,Big Mistake,I disliked this book. It was really dull. I would of rather read the Boxcar Kids a hundred million times. I would never recommend this book to anyone!! I made a bad decision to read this book. Please don't make the same mistake.
1,A Great Book to Help Insomniacs Go to Sleep!!,"What was Jean thinking? How in the world did his parents not report him missing? Of course, he lives in a tree. This book is so unrealistic because there could not possibly be a tree with a thick enough trunk in New York to hollow out. Of course, I wouldn't know, because I fell asleep after the first couple pages. I don't know what all of these people read, but it couldn't be this book. Now, you are probably wondering why I finished it (I mean skimmed it). I was forced to read it by my 5th grade teacher. She was probably scoffing at us behind our backs ""ha, ha! I'll make them read this book"". Why can't Sam have any troubles? You couldn't possibly train a wild falcon. It would scratch your eyes out before you even had a chance to touch it. I recommended this book to only one person, my worst enemy. So, please do yourself a favor (a BIG favor) and stay far away from this book."
5,A GREAT BOOK.,The book My side of the Mountain is a good book all ages.This book makes you feel like you are living in the hollowed out tree with Frightful and eating nature stuff.But at the end Sam was kind of mad because all the people he meets come to his tree and spends the night.So his family comes out to live with him in the trees.I recommend this book to anyone who likes books.
4,A momentous adventure in the deep of the Catskills.,"My Side of the Mountain is an outstanding book. It is a great adventure for all ages. It's a momentous, exlerent, thrilling adventures in the deep of the Catskills. The book revolves around a young city boy who decides to venture out to the wildeness of the Catskills, on his own. He discovers many of the thrills of the wilderness and meets many new friends. He battles the dangers of the winter. He learns about his life in his adventure."
3,A great book!,"Very good book! My reading teacher, Mr. Ross, says it helps you survive in the woods and it's also a great story. I think that's true. Although most of my friends say it's boring. I rated it 3 starts--that means it's great, because I'm very exigent with rating."
5,Great for younger kids too!!!,I have 2 children under 6 yrs old. Even though they can't read yet it makes a wonderful bedtime story to be read out loud. Also with few pictures in the books it encourages discussion and exploration of what it would be like to live off the land without modern technology. I LOVED this book as a child myself and am excited to see my kids enjoying My Side of the Mountain.
4,A great book for anyone young or old & looking for adventure,"This book was given to me and my class in Grade Six. In the beginning everyone thought it was going to be boring. Once we started to read it we realized it was great. After that our teacher took us outside to try and make some of the tools Sam used. Our class even spent the night in the woods to learn how Sam felt. We all had a terrific time and began to look at the book differently. It wasn't just make-believe, but realistic situations."
4,"BOY RUNS AWAY...EATS ROOTS...WHAT""S NOT TO LIKE?","I can still remember my grade school librarian reading this book to my 4th grade class. I was BORED silly for maybe 5 minutes....next thing I knew she was closing the book and we were sent back to homeroom. Every day to follow I couldn't wait to hear more of this story. Thank goodness she sat us down and read it out loud. I don't know if I would have picked it up on my own at that age. Yes, the premise a bit implausible. Trite perhaps. But for the age of person for which it was written, it is sure to draw him in."
4,How Long Will Sam Survive?,"Sam Gribley from My Side of the Mountain by Jean Craighead George is an outdoorsy type of boy. He ran away from home to find the Gribley farm and found some unexpected friends.One of these friends happens to be a hawk named Frightful. He also encounters a group of birds that remind him of his neighbors back home. Another friend is a savage weasel that he calls the Baron Weasel. There are also others, but you will have to read the book to get to know them better.This book is very informative for a realistic fiction. Sam's knowledge of the great outdoors keeps progressing throughout this wonderfully told story. This book is sure to astound you.If you want to find out how long Sam will last all alone in the wilderness, then you will have to read this book yourself. It caught my attention and I enjoyed every minute of it. I hope you enjoy it too.Emily, A 6th grader"
5,Billy Bob Fread Jones,"My Side Of The Mountain is a book about a boy named Sam Gribly who is the main character & lives in New York.He wants to live in the Gribly mountains.He tells his parents about his plan but they dont believe him.This book is about advetuors and is suspensful.The moral of the story is if you have a dream follow it and to never give up because a lot of good can come out of it.Sam gose from a boy who dosen't believe in himself to a boy who depends on himself.Out of 2,000 I would give it a 2,000.The athor is Jean Craighead Gorge.It is a great book and I recamend this book to readers 8 and up.This book is published in 1959-1988.I really hope you read this book ."
5,My Side of the Mountain,"Wow! What a wonderful book. I just finished this book with 2 of my groups of kids in school. Both have really enjoyed it, ages 10 - 13, boys & girls. We are looking forward to finding out what happens in the sequel. As a teacher I sometimes struggle to find books that appeal to both boys & girls; & to kids who don't always like to read. My Side of the Mountain does a great job getting & keeping their interest."
3,My Side of the Mountain,"I would recommend this book to a friend because it was interesting to learn about how a person can survive in the wilderness. I was really surprised when he did survive because I wouldn't be able to survive because I am not the outdoors type of person. Also, it was a book that got me reading, which I don't do very often. This is a book I would read again even though I've read it because it got me so caught up I couldn't put it down. I think this would be a good book for all ages to read because it tells about the many adventures about a boy trying to survive in the wilderness."
3,My Side of The Mountain Review,"I like the book, but I don't want to read it again.Some parts are boring and some parts are exiting. The parts that are boring ,is when Frightful went to fly with the falcon.The exciting part is when Sam had a party. The book is great. Sam is the guy that ran away. Sam is the main character. Frightful is Sam's falcon. Frightful is like Sam's companion. That is why I like this book."
3,My Side of The Mountain Review,"My opion is it wasn't a the best book and no I wouldn't read it again.I do not recommend the book to young readers but to adults definitly. This book has a lot of good topic sentences. All the sentenses make a point. If I had to rate the book I would give it a 3. For girls I do not recommened this book. Only if u like adventure. Out of all I not recommend. But if you like adventure, and like to read a book wit lots of good vocabulary take some time of of your sedual and read My Side of th Mountain!"
4,Great read,I read this book for school and I thought it might be a little boring but I was wrong. Good job Jean:)
3,Three means good for me.,"By my count, a three star review is a book that was fun to read, and that is the perfect way to describe this childrens' story. I reserve a four star review for books that I think everyone SHOULD read, and that's just not right here, but this is a book that I think that most people would be happy with after the fact. Definately worth buying if you already have some interest."
4,Review for My Side of The Mountain,This is a great book. I loved the story and how he thought how to use everything he saw to his advantage. Highly recommend.
4,My Side of the Mountain for Geniuses,"My Side of the Mountian is an extraordinary book written by Jean Craighead George.A boy named Sam Gribley decided to run away from the city. Nobody believed he would do it, but he did. Sam built a house, found a stream, and found food. But Sam is lonely so he captures a peregrine falcon and trains it to get him food and so he's not so lonely. I recommend this book to anyone who likes adventure books. This book is as good as Hatchet."
4,A GREAT AND EXCITING BOOK!,"I love this book because it has a lot of action and adventure init. I love action and adventure. I recommend this book formostly everybody, whether they like excitment or not, it isstill a good book for mostly everybody!"
4,ahh-- okay,"As I say in my title, it was okay. I'd actually say more of a 3 and half than a four. The book is about a boy who ran away from home and decided to live in the woods. I think that it's very good compared to another one of her books, Water Sky (which I also reviewed). Jean Craighead George does a decent job on this. There just isn't enough action in it to keep me enthrawlled."
4,Yeah for Sam Gribley,My Side of the Mountain is a great book. Jean Craighead George must have spent a lot of time in the forest. Her descriptions of the landscape and anecdotes regarding the animals are vivid. The only thing that doesn't ring true is the fact that a young kid goes and lives on his own in the wild and no adults appear to be concerned. A very enjoyable read.
2,lets see here.....,I think this book was an ok book. I think this because i like the outdoors and i like camping. So if u dont realy like the outdoors than u might not like this book. Considering alost all of the book is based on the wilderness. The thing i didn't like about this book is that it dragged on and on.It got kind of boring.It also used big words and kept talking about the same thing.So thats what i thought about the book My side of the mountain.
2,My Side of the Moutain,"I think that the this book was okay. It was filled with andervous eciting momens. But overall it was pretty good.I would recomend this book to my friends if they where into adventous storyies, and thats what i think of My Side Of The Moutain."
2,My Sideof The Mountain,My Side of The Mountain is a book about a boy and his bird named Frightful. He ran away from home and went to live in the woods. He built his house in a tree. This boy's name is Sam Gribley. For food Sam would sometimes go down to the creek try to get some fish to cook over a small fire. It wasn't always that Sam could get a fire going. My opinion is that I didn't really like the book.
2,My Side of the Mount Review,"My Side of the Mountain is about a determined boy named Sam who thinks he can do anything. Only armed with flint and steel and a strong heart he get's ready to to test his survival skills in the Catskills. But will he survive with Winter creeping up on him?This is a unrealistic book because everything goes Sam's way. For example, when he he makes his house NOTHING goes wrong. I also think this is unrealistic because there are hungry bears that would be attracted to his food. All in all I don't recommend this book."
3,Olivia's Review,"My Side of the Mountain is about this boy named Sam that left home because his family thought he couldn`t go to the Catskill Mountains. He did so and he tried to survive in the wild. He thought at first it was difficult, but when he got halfway it got easier and easier.I sort of hate this book. I give it a 3 because in the beginning, it's sad. The middle is sort of happy. The end was surprising."
3,Nature Kid,"This was a good book, in my opinion. My favorite part was in the middle, when Sam has just survived his first winter in the Catskills. It was very good when he had just realized that he could survive alone in the forest wthout aid.-Emma D. (for a school project)"
4,My Review for My Side of the Mountain by Chloe Fernandes,I thought the book was sad in one part when Sam took Frightful from her nest and away from her family. But I thought it was good in the end when Sam's family came to live with him. I liked most of the book and I would recommend it to others.
4,my review,"I really liked this book, it taught me some really interesting facts about the how to survive in the wild. I never relized how hard it is to live in the wild. You have to know alot about it, like what you can eat and what you cant. I dont think I could ever live in the wild .Although I enjoyed reading this book. I thought it was very informative and interesting."
4,It was overall a good book,I found the storyline to be quite original at its time an to be an overall great story
4,Grate book a must read,"My Side of the Mountain is about a nameed Sam Gribly. He runs a way to the Catskll Mountains. He gits rides all the way there, wants he is there he finds a gint Hemlock tree digs the old rotin wood out then burns the rest out, he makes lots of usful tools and gits a pet falcon, gits books from the nere by town's library."
4,"A great book, interesting, exciting, I didn`t like the end.","I thought this book started out making me feel interested to keep reading the book. I like how the author put interesting details to go along with the informative ways to make assorted things ranging from food, all the way to how to make a home in a BIG tree. It`s also interesting how he finds his pet and trains it to do the things he wants it to. I would love to have the skills he posseses. And the way he deals with the assorted animals is really amazing, and how he makes freinds with alot of them. And then there is the wide variety of animals that were mentioned.What I don`t like is the way he almost lets his self get found and how he just went home when his mother said so. He could have at least resisted a little. Well I am a 12 year old boy and there isn`t much for me to say so I give this book a 4 star rating and tell the author ""GREAT work an the adventures and animals-i just didn`t like the ending."
3,Average,This was a very average book. It wasn't great but it wasn't terrible either. Read it if you like the wilderness. I thought that it had a very poor plot. Try it...you have nothing to lose!!
5,Very good book,"My favorite part of the book is that Sam lives on his own. I like this part because I like to hunt, fish and be outside in the woods. I didn't think there was a bad part in the book. I liked it all.My favorite character is probably Sam because his likes the things I like. I recommend this book for 9,10,11,12,and older for this book. I think this because it is a longer book and you have to be able to understand parts in the book."
4,6th Grade Daughter's Review,"The fictional story, ""My Side of The Mountain"", by Jean Craighead George is an adventurous tale about a 15 year old boy--Sam Gribley--who decides to run away into the Catskill Mountains of New York. He makes some unexpected friends along the way. Frightful, Sam's pet Falcon, is loyal and acts as a security alarm by squawking at approaching dangers. The Baron, a weasel, and Bando, a human, are also very well written side characters. The ending is disappointing and leaves the reader feeling empty, so perhaps the resolution will be found in the sequels. ""My Side of The Mountain"" is a fun story for children 9-13 who wish they could escape into the wild."
3,My Side of the Mountain,"I read the book, My Side of the Mountain, and thought it was okay. I was not in love with it, nor did I hate it. I like how it is done in a journal entry sort of way, and how Sam took notes on certain things throughout the novel. While I was reading the story, I often wondered how Sam survived in the woods by himself with no food or shelter. At times, I thought the book was boring, and I was dreading to read on. There were also moments when I really enjoyed the book and had trouble putting it down. When I finished it, I was not sad that it was over like I am with some books. I was actually sort of excited that I was through. I think it is more of a nature person book or a boy book. I don't recommend it for girls, unless they love the woods and survival of the fittest kinds of novels. ADS"
3,Cheap copy of fantastic book,This is an amazing story! One of my favorites as a child...and now one of my 6 yr old boy's favorites. I bought two copies to give as presents to my son's friends. I was very disappointed with the quality of the copy. There are illustrations in this book that are important to the story and these illustrations are not crisp in this copy. Yes! Buy this book - just not from this publisher.
4,This is a great book,"If you are thinking this book is about someone who owns a side of a mountain, you're wrong. It's about a boy who lives off the land. This book was a little short and it needs more illustrations to help the reader picture what the author is talking about. But the story teaches survival techniques and it's a book you can't put down until you find out what happens. So if you can read for hours on top of hours and even if you can't read that long, You Should Read This Book!"
5,I Love this Book!,"I love this book, this is the first book I ever read all the way to the end. Im suprised that it is still avaliable. Amazing.....I read this book almost 15 years ago and still to today it is the best book I have ever read. Not even Steven King can come close."
3,"""My Side of the Mountain.""review","I am going to tell you about the book ""My Side of the Mountain."" I liked the book because it is very exciting. It is about a boy that runs away from home because it is very noisy and gets annoyed alot. I would recommened tis book for people ages 9 to 12 to read this book. It is a very adventerous book. This is my book review for ""My side of the Mountain."""
2,My Side of the Mountain Review,"In my opnion, it is not a very good book. It is very boring Nothing happens. It's not exciting. I will NEVER read it again. All it ever talks about is Sam catching food, hanging out with people and animals. He should do something else"
3,My Side of the Mountian reveiw,"I thought that the story was pretty good. It was not my favorite story, but it was good. But it was a little unbeliveable because most kids his age don't want to run away for no good reason. It's because that most kids that would run away like that problt wouldn't live so good off the land like that. And in the end it was not very real because if I did that, my parents wouldn't live in the woods with me. They would probly noy want to give up living in the city, and make me come home.By Allison Wilson"
5,review to My Side of the Mountain.,"My Side of the mountain, is about a boy named Sam Gribley. He has ran away from his over croded aprtment in New York City . He finds a falcon baby. names it frightfull. and finds a weasl named Barron. I think the book was exciting .I think people 9 to 100 should read this book. just think how many times you wanted to run away and only got to the end of the driveway or even the first step, he shows alot of curage to go through with it. I know that i tried to run away and my parents just laughed. sam gribley is very strong . i give it 5 stars. so go out and read"
5,MY SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN,"Sam Gribley is tired of living in a crowded NYC apartment so he runs awayto the Catskill Mountain wilderness to forge a life of his own. No one takes his plans seriously except Sam himself. With only a penknif, a ball of cord, $40, and some flint and stell, he must rely on his own ingenuity, and on the resources of the land to survive. And survive he does.Alone in the mountains Sam learns about courage, danger, and the meaning of companionship, and captures it all in his journal. My Side of the Mountain is the vivid and engrossing account of the year that changes Sam's life. ""A MUST READ"""
3,My Side of the Mountain,"I liked the book but the thing I disliked was why did Sam run off. This book is a great one if you like survivor stories. If you wanna know does it match up to other survior stories like Hatchet and The Cay I would pick the other ones first, but this book is still good. It is amazing how he takes simple plants like cattail roots and pennroyal and makes them his everyday dinner and tea. If you like survivor stories this is a book to consider."
2,My Side Of The Mountain,"This book was an okay book and I probably wouldn't read this book again because it's boring,there are no good main events,plus the book goes nowhere throughtout the hole thing.I wouldn't recommend this book.Plus,Sam can do almost anything.That is why I don't recommend this book."
4,My side of the Mountain,4 stars My Side of the Mountain by Jean Craighead GeorgeMy Side of the Mountain is about a boy named Sam Gribly that runs away and lives in the wild on Catskill Mountain. He studied survival books to be ready. He makes homes out of many things. He is very creative. I would recommend this book to 4th grade and up. tp
3,"no plot, but an interesting guide to the wilderness","It's kind of Walden for kids, as a young boy sets out to live in the wilderness and simplify his life by enjoying nature and escaping civilization. It sounds weird, and plot-wise, it doesn't make a lot of sense. But it's still a lovely and interesting book about survival and nature in the Catskills. Grade: B"
4,"Fun to read, but filled with problems...","I've read My Side of the Mountain dozens of time in my life. It's a fun book to read and you learn a bit about nature, but the way the book is written, some of the characters, and the unbelievable elements of the book detract from the overall reading experience. Sam's friends are pretty gay, and there's no way any parents would let their son run away. I find it hard to believe that he survives the winter all alone in the mountains. Sam is a pretty thin character. In this book, they all are. I think it's gay how Sam names all the animals. This book is worth reading. It's entertaining, and fun to reread. Give it a try, just don't expect too much. I've read the sequel, On the Far Side of the Mountain. Parts of it are good, but it's a strange story. Not very engrossing. Trust me."
2,"eh, well...","I read this book in 7th grade. It wasn't badly written or anything, but even then I found it unrealistic. I just couldn't bring myself to believe that this young boy could survive in the wilderness, and that ruined the book for me, for the most part."
1,my side of the mountain,Dear ReadersI would not recomend this book because it was not a mystery or an exciting book. I think it was like a diary of Sam Gribley. It was not my style of books. I do not think it was action packed or intertaning. I would prefer another book. One example of a unliked part is when he told his bird that he would throw a party of Halloween for the animals. This is just my oppenion so read this book and com up with your own.
5,My favorite book as a kid,"I read this book as a youngster (I'm now 37) and to this day I remember so much of the detail. It's a wonderful story for children who enjoy the outdoors, animals, and dream of being on their own."
3,A Review By A Person,"This book was great. Sam runs away because his apartment is filled with all of his siblings and his parents. From meeting strangers and them coming back to visit him,and stealing a baby duck hawk falcon,then naming it Frightful, Sam leads an exciting life in the Catskill mountians."
3,My side of the mountain book report.,I think the book My Side Of The Mountain was a pretty good book.I loved where Sam was training Frightful to catch their food and not eat it before Sam could clean it.I think that is amazing because not everyone can train a bird that came right out of the wild. I did not really like the end where his family moved up to the Catskills and we did not get to know whether their house was built or if they just lived in the trees like Sam.I think Jean should right another book about Sam's whole family living on the mountain.I liked the rest of the book anyways.Compared to the movie I think you should read the book. Even if didn't end the way I would like it to I recamend this book to anyone who loves the adventures with the wild.
4,My Side of the Mountain,My Side of the Mountain a very interesting book. The bookwas about a boy named Sam. He runs away to the Catskill Mountains. There he starts life near a small creek . Later on in the book he hollows out a hemlock tree and decides to live there. He also takes ababy peregrine falcon which he names Frightful. Frightful is proven to be useful because she catches food and is a good companion. I think this book was exciting. It was exciting because he has to get deer from hunters and try not get caught. I recomd this book to other 6th graders. I hope you read this book.
4,My book review,My side of the mountain is a book about a boy who runs away and lives off the land. he has many adventuresand discovers new things. If you want to learn more about this book i suggest all 6th graders to read it.
4,A pretty good book,I thought that this was a good adventure book. There are some surprising turns throughout the book that keep it exciting. Some parts were corny but others were thrilling. It's about a boy that runs away from the city to his Great Grandfather's old farm and lives in the woods. He catches a baby falcon and teaches it to catch food for both of them. It is a good book I give it **** stars.
5,Listen up,I recommend My Side of the Mountain for people who like adventure stories because the book is about Sam and his adventure living in the wild.
4,My Thought,"It is about a boy that runs away from home and tries to survive. He gets a new best friend and learns how to survive off the land.I'd rate this book 4 star out of five, because the beginning started out slow and kind of confusing. I liked how it got sad exciting and had mischief."
3,My Side of The Mountain Review,I liked your book but I would not want to read it again.I would not read it again because it is boring.Some parts are boring and some parts are exciting in the book.The part that is boring in the book is when Frightful the falcon teaches another falcon to fly.That part was very boring.The part that is really exciting is when Sam the main character runs to the willderness.That part is really exciting.Your book was good but mabey not good enough.
1,A Book,"I enjoyed the book but i didn't like it very much because it was more of a journal of someone living in the bush rather than a book, it was about a boy that leaves home and lives in the bush then his family finds him in the bush and then they all live together in the bush."
1,The Worst Book Ever,"I read this book for fifth grade and hated it. It is very unrealistic and boring. The main character, Sam Gribley runs away from home and lives in the catskill mountains. You're probably thinking that I am a person who hates all newbery medal books. Actually, I like many Classic books, but this isn't one of them. Need some examples? The Giver, The Sign of the Beaver, The Awakening, Call It Courage, Holes, Bud Not Buddy, Amos Fortune:Free Man, Bridge to Terabithia, Charlotte's Web, Number the Stars, Dear Mr. Henshaw, The Golden Goblet, and A Single Shard. You may really like this book. However, this book isn't for me. I also know many people who hate this book as well. If you like books about survival, you might like this. However, if you hate books about survival, don't waste your money buying this."
1,My Side of The Mountain Review,I truly would not recommend this book.It is very boring and has very little exitement.It is all about a boy in a forest.This is only my opinion though.I did not likethis book.
2,My Side of the Mountain,"I read this book for a school summer project. I would have to say that I have read better. I think that the way this book was writen was great, but all together I found the story and it's events boring and repetitive."
2,Larissa's My Side of the Mountain Review,"Sam is running away from home because he can't take the city anymore, but where will he go? A forest and live in a tree. Will he survive? Will he go back home? Will someone find him? You can find all the answers in the book My Side of the Mountain!I don't really care about this book all that much because why would you run away and take a big risk of dying? If this was a true story, I would think that kid is crazy! I give this 2 stars."
2,My Side of the Mountain,"My opinion of the book was that it was okay. It wasn't the best, but it was pretty interesting because Sam just decited that he was going to run away and live in the Catskill Mountains to find his Great-Grandfather Gribley's farm. His parents had no problem with it because they thought he was going to come back home just like Sam's father did when he was his age. If I was in the position of his parents I would't let him go. It was also interesting how he made his treehouse, got his food, how he cooked it, preserved it, and lived in the willderness with the company of Frightful, the Baron, the other animals, and rarely seeing a human being. It took a lot of braveness and courage. I could never do what he did."
3,My Side of the Mountain,I liked the book but I didn't like that he had to live in a house with his family again at the end. How come? That isn't fair. He was doing just fine without his family. And even if his family did come...Why didn't they all live like him??? I liked it though. I was just confused that he was living in a house again at the end.
3,"I thought My Side of the Mountain was an overall, o.k. book.","I thought My Side of the Mountain was for the most part, pretty good. It was slow to start, but started to get better towards the end.It's about how Sam runs away from his busy New York City home, and into the Catskill Mountains. Sam has to survive on plants and animals for food, shelter, clothes, and friends.However, Sam runs into trouble when a reporter goes into the mountains to try to find ""wild boy"", as he was called in the news. The young reporter figures out that Sam is this ""wild boy"", so Sam makes him promise not to write about him, or where he is living, in the papers.As I said above, I thought the book was o.k. I would reccomend it to those who are interested in nature and adventure."
3,X review,I thought this book was ok case it gives a lot of information. The book is weird because of the stuff that he got and friends he met. I like it because what he dose there. It is to short. How he to that falcon.
4,A true classic,"I first read this book when I was about 11 years old. Back then, it was my favourite book. I really admired Sam for having the courage of his convictions and live off of the land. Some 21 odd years later, I read the book again. To my surprise, I have a greater admiration for Sam and his decision to runaway and live in the Catskills Mountains now than I did when I was 11. I think that few adults would have the audacity to leave the conforts of home and live off of their wits. The thought of failure would be enough to put them off. This book left me with an immense sense of liberation and adventure. It will not be another 21 odd years before I read this little treasure again."
3,"BASIL DEARDEN, OPUS 31","Hard to believe that Dirk Bogarde would forget Mary Ure, even after an extended stay in a hot bath! Rejoice! He will fall in love again after having helped her to give birth to their fourth child. An interesting Relph/Dearden movie of the early 60's. Recommended."
5,Best strings for acoustic guitar!,"I have been using these strings for about a year. With the Nano coating I get about 3 months of life from them, playing about 40mins a day, before they start sounding flat. Much less string noise when you are sliding to another fret and the phosphor bronze gives you great tone. A little more expensive than regular strings but well worth it! Cheaper in the long run beacause you have to change the strings less often."
3,ELIXIR STRINGS,Great sounding strings but I noticed the coating starts coming of in a couple of weeks. I will go back to standard strings because the extra cost is not worth it.
3,returns,"Shoe product was fine, once finally delivered. Had to return item and was refunded LESS than the item cost, itself. That explains why I use Zappos !!"
1,Very Disappointed!,"I did not expect the quality of flag that flies over the capital or even one that is weather resent, but I did expect to receive a flag that possessed some detail to the images that are upon it. The bears are brown pieces of cloth that look like they were cut out with a cookie cutter and then sew on the other colored materials. No detail to the bears or anything else. One cheap piece of cloth. Don't waist your money."
2,Not What I Expected,"The title should be ""Images of Vintage Postcards"". The book is simply pictures of postcards in black and white. I thought these would be useable postcards that would be fun to send, otherwise I would not have ordered it."
3,Should be called a different title,"I coach lacrosse and ""foundation"" is a poor word to describe this video. Geared towards 1st year players, it's really slow to develop so I would say 5th graders should be watching this. The title and desciption is misleading.I did learn beginner tips but zero helped me in the field."
5,A truly charming read ...,"I love romances and this book spoke directly to my heart. Charmingly written, THAT SCANDALOUS HEIRESS is a winner in every sense. The characters were well written and thoroughly likeable. Marianne was a special delight and I could see why Adam was immediately intrigued by her. The chemistry between the hero and heroine was there from the first meeting and sustained throughout the entire book.I also thought the mystery element of the story was perfectly handled -- it was just enough to add to the story without obscuring the plot.This is one of the best books I've read this year and I will read it again. BRAVO, Ms. Kirkland! You never fail.Run, do not walk, to buy this book."
5,Swept away into Regency England!,"Once again, Martha Kirkland (my very favorite Regency author) has treated us to a well-crafted, lovely tale that is so beautifully and authentically written, I feel like I'm sitting in a drawing room, enjoying tea with the Regent himself. Marianne is a wonderful heroine who defies the strict societal rules of the day and chooses to live alone in a manor house she's inherited. Adam, Viscount Jensen, is a worthy match for Marianne and I greatly enjoyed seeing them overcome their problems and differences to find true love. Do yourself a favor--brew a cup of your favorite tea, put your feet up, and let Martha Kirkland take you away to Regency England for a few wonderful, memorable hours."
5,A Great Diet!,"Finally, a diet that makes sense and helps you manage what you eat without retooling your lifestyle. It didn't make me tired or leave me feeling hungry, and within a week I started to feel lighter! The recipes are great too."
2,Good Concept...But Needs Work,"This DVD focuses more on the behind-the-scenes aspect of erotic photography than on actually being erotic. While it may conatin full nudity, too much of the content is taken up by interviews and it basically serves no other purpose than learning more about the models themselves. As an added disappointment, the visual quality of this DVD falls short of even the lowest VHS standards, looking as if someone shot it with a camcorder. I would certainly think twice about buying it."
1,rip-off,Save the anticipation and just burn [your money]. The whole dvd is a camera set up at a photo shoot.......the lamest DVD is have ever seen.
3,"I havnt seen this one, but ive heard its great.........","Well i havnt seen this one but i hear its great, to any porn fan out there, i suppose you'll like this one, have a nice..............day."
5,Easy and fun,"This was the first numerology book I ever read, and it was so easy and fun, that I was inspired to go on and learn more about this fascinating science. But even tho I've read many more sophisticated books, I alreays return to this becouse the information, while simple, uses an economy of words to say precisely what the big books say in a much better format. It's really fun, and surprisingly accurate. Great book to take to parties. Everyone will love it. Thanks :-)"
5,Instant Numerology,This was purchased as a gift. I own a copy and relatives find it very useful. It is easy to use and the service was prompt for my order.
5,WHAT A GREAT READ!!!,"Mr. Aiken is a prolific writer and pours his soul out lyrically. The title speaks for itself and will take you on an emotional rollercoaster. Enjoy his emphatic expressions of love, inspiration, and revolution. You won't be disappointed."
2,Not a Webkins,"Bought this for my 5 year old for christmas, she wanted a webkins, this came up under that catagory, you have to be careful, not all stuffed animals with a computer code are Webkins. This has a code and you go on the computer but not under Webkins, it is a totally different site and not connected to Webkins at all. She was very disappointed."
3,I Saw Someone Killin' Santa Claus...,"It's Christmas-time in London, and someone is killing people dressed as Santa Claus. Yep, there's a psycho loose! DOTC is yet another entry in the christmas horror / thriller sub-genre. However, unlike Silent Night Deadly Night or Christmas Evil, this time the murderer is a plainclothes sicky who hunts down St. Nick impersonators, bumping them off in grizzly ways including impalement and urinal-side castration! So, if you absolutely hate the hustle-bustle of holiday shopping, or just want to see many faux santas slaughtered, this is your cup of nog! P.S.- I particularly enjoyed Kate (Belinda Mayne), the beautiful heroine of the movie. She's sort of a bizarre cross between Jane Fonda and Marilyn Chambers. Ho! Ho! Ho!..."
2,they are dangerous (just like other GE's ive tried),"let me just get to the point. i bought these for 2 single bulb seiling fixtures. 1 started creaking and poping and one day i turned on the light. it started makng a sizzling noise so i turned the light back off. it of couse was defected. they were not used often. when it was used it was for 1-2 hours at a time and about once every couple of days. (that was about two years after i got them. the next bulb was in the same type of fixture except in a different room. it is used a little more than the other and is acting quite shot out. Brown, colors, dim etc. Obviosly since these bulbs have had a shorter life span than the 750 hour 100 watt bulbs before them they are not good bulbs."
1,Caused me to delay getting essential treatment,"While true of some kids, the book does not portray situations true of all children. Some children do not simply start talking later, rather they have an issue than needs to be addressed earlier. The earlier a child starts to communicate (verbally, using signs), the better for his brain development. There are many disorders (for instance verbal dyspraxia/apraxia) where the child benefits greatly by getting therapy earlier. The more you wait the worse the outcome is. Because of reading this book, I delayed necessary treatment for my son until he was age four, and I highly regret it. His problem is not something that would have resolved simply on its own and the delay was not because of anything the author suggested. I am very annoyed that I was seduced by the ideas in this book, because my son's brain processing ability suffered from not getting intervention earlier."
3,Interesting if unscientific exploration,"It is a touching and helpful book. It has little in the way of statistics or scientific research to back up its observations. Sowell takes predictable swipes at the educational establishment. Still, that said, I would recommend it to worried parents as interesting and reassuring."
4,Late talking child reviews Late-Talking Children,"My sister says this book describes me to a tee. Well, she's always had the better memory of our childhood days.I didn't start talking until I was 4, but started talking in complete sentences right away. Like Sowell's (too) many examples, I had speech therapy classes in elementary school, was unusually fond of mathematics, and wound up working on computers - before they were common.This is a must-have book if you have an inquisitive son who can take apart anything and can communicate without talking. Don't let the public school labellers label him learning disabled or autistic. He'll turn out fine without their ""help""."
4,This book described my son,"When I finished reading this book the first time, I was nearly in tears as I had read a description of my late talking, uniquely talented preschool-age son. The book gave me hope, advised me of questions I could ask in helping my son and directions to go to learn more. I believe his work in this area is the first step in the study of these unique, late talking children."
3,"Good book, just off target for my child","This book is very specific in that it talks of children (mostly boys) who do not talk for a very specific reason. This is for children who do not talk because they are gifted in the areas of math, music and abstract arts. The children eventually talk with a little help from their parents and professionals. The children excel at numbers and sometimes have musical gifts.My child did not fit this specific area so it was not useful to me. Regardless it was well written, easy to understand and had plenty of examples and real life events. The author is driven by the topic and knows it well. If your child fits the specific audience, it is a must read as it has many contacts and ideas for helping this specific type of child."
1,False Hope.,"This book gives false hope to parents whose children are nonverbal due to PDD,Tourete Syndrome, SI dysfunction, Asperger systromes or children with undiagnosed Oral motor Problem. So Readers beware."
2,TOTAL LIE,"There are only 6 pouches in a pack, though its clearly labeled as having 10! The pouches themselves are fine, basic cheap construction, but you only get 6 when you've paid for 10!"
2,Disappointing- take handler lessons,"Based upon the reviews, I'm not sure if we were reading the same book. This was extremely disappointing, and revealed very few handling techniques. There was very limited to no discussion of ring patterns, stacking, turning, conditioning etc. Don't skimp on handling classes- you will definitely need them, as this book will be of very little help."
5,Great book with lots of pictures!,"This is a great book for anyone learning how to handle dogs. It gives you great pictures of how you are supposed to stack dogs. Other books tell you how to do it, but lack pictures. This also uses a variety of breeds in their pictures. It goes over stacking on the ground vs. stacking on the table. It also does a good job explaining the dog show world, which can be confusing for newcomers. I highly recommend this book...even more than George Alston's book (another great one!)."
3,Indescribable,"For the love of Pete! This is probably the worst cover existent on the planet. Jessica Simpson did ""Take My Breath Away"" all right and ""Angels"" quite brilliantly, but ""These Boots""??! Puuuuhhhleeez. She sounds like she's trying to be sexy and throaty like Britney, but Britney can do it better than Jessica. It's unnatural and completely unbelievable - Simpson sounds whiny, contrived and, at times, constipated. Since 2003's mildly successful In This Skin Mrs. Nick Lachey has sounded too much like she's trying to fill in No. 1 female pop star Britney Spears' shoes, which Simpson just can't do. Sure, she can sing, but not like she used to. Parts of this song are mildly entertaining, like the part where she actually tries to sing it, but throughout the entire single you may find yourself putting your boots on and walkin' out, too."
2,Christina?,"I think this song is just o.k.I also think Jessica and her parents are hypocrites, they bashed Christina Aguilera for what she wore or did not wear, but then she comes out half naked in this video. Jessica said she was trying to portray the spirit of the movie.What a lame excuse, was that the real reason ???????"
1,This Sucks!,"I am a huge fan of Nancy Sinatra and Lee Hazlewood, so when I saw that Jessica Simpson had a cover of this famous song, I was curious to see.It's horrible!When Nancy and Lee produced ""These Boots"" Lee told Nancy to act like a 16 yr. old who's angry at being taken advantage of by her 40 yr. old messin' around truck driver boyfriend. You can feel that persona type come through in the song. But Jessica's version is I don't know what! When I saw the video she made, it seem like she'd be doing a favor to any guy who she walked on and he'd enjoy it with some kind of sado-masochistic pleasure!She imbues a whole different meaning to the song, turning herself into some kind of sex-goddess in Daisy Dukes.If you want the real deal, listen to the original by Nancy Sinatra. Don't waste any time or money with Jessica's version."
1,*barfing noises*,"I have never heard a cover as bad as Jessica Simpson's rendition of this song... granted, the original version isn't the best either, but still, it runs way farther ahead then the version that Jessica has released.Really, the song is just a total and complete s***fest. Jessica usually can sing way better than this, she has a much higher range. But in this song, all she does is purr quietly like an annoying little sex kitten. I can just imagine her wearing a sluttish outift (hmmm... super short-shorts and a belly-baring shirt, maybe?), while she tramps across stage ""singing"" this song. Britney Spears would do a better job trying to sing the way Jessica does; it just doesn't sound right when Jessica does it.In addition to her bad singing, the music itself is just annoying and will give you a headache by the time the song is over- or even before.Please, be smart and don't waste your money on this single. Even her cover of ""Take My Breath Away"" is better then this.Avoid at all costs."
1,save your money,"I bought this tub because, well, it was cheap and folded up nicely for storing. However, once i used it i hated it. My newborn would slip over to the side and bump her head very easily (yes i kept at least one hand on her at all times)or be able to nearly turn completly sideways. It also is a pain to drain, most of the water comes out but leaves some water in the bottom ridge on the side opposite the plug. The only good thing about it is the storage of it.."
1,Safety Hazard!,"We purchased this product about three weeks ago, from Wal-Mart. Tonight, when bathing out month old infant, she managed to stick her finger into the hinge on the head side folding side. It took about two minutes to free here, and the end result was some skin breakage, and swell.In general we like Safety 1st products, but now on we will double think purchasing their products."
3,good for travel,"This tub would not be my choice to use at home. I bought it to use when travelling and so far it has worked well. I place it in bathtub or shower. My child is 4 months and did not hate this tub ( judging by the lack of screams). There is enough water to keep the baby partially covered and warm. The baby did roll a bit from side to side, so I had a keep a hand on the baby at all times. But for a quick bath, the tub worked fine. It folded quite easily. I did not have a problem with fingers getting caught in the folding mechanism. The tub also dries pretty quickly. The price was great too ( I bought it at Walmart for half the price it sells for on Amazon."
2,"Small, compact","I used this tub for my first born. This is small and holds very little water, therefore, the water gets cold fast! Also, there are holes where the tub folds up so the water spills out of the holes as the baby moves. It can be messy if you are giving your baby a bath on the floor as I did.Our baby would stick her foot and leg out of the tub because it's so small...when I used larger tub, that didn't happen.One positive thing that I can say about this product is that it's compact...I kept it at my mother's house and it didn't take up much space.I would recommend spending an extra $10 to $15 and buy a higher quality tub."
1,Not enough support for a newborn,"This tub has a great concept with being able to fold up - but is terrible for a newborn. There is not enough support for the baby and he or she will slip and slide all over - even if you are holding onto the baby with one hand. I threw this tub out and purchased one with a net that snaps on over top of the tub. This is MUCH better and safer since it cradles the baby while bathing. Once he or she is old enough to sit up without support, you can take the net off and use the plastic tub like a regular baby bath tub. Safety 1st also makes this kind for roughly $15."
2,Uncomfortable and hard to use,"I do not recommend this tub. The baby is in an awkward position in it, and if his head turns to the side, it is up against a jutting edge. This tub was too big for my sink, so I used it on the countertop. It only holds a couple of inches of water before it starts spilling out at the folding areas, so the baby is always cold during the bath."
5,Got our money's worth,"My son is now 8 months old and we still use this tub. It is worth it's weight in gold. I used it in the sink, counter and inside the regular tub. We only had issues in the sink (our sink was really not big enough for it to fit)"
1,"Never used it, not for newborn","Hmmm... thre's no way our newborn could stay safe in this, there's not support. Another baby product gone unused."
2,I had major safety problems with this tub,"This tub was great in the beginning - it fit perfectly in our kitchen sink and we were able to bathe our baby with no problems at all. It was great that she could sit in the warm water and not get cold while I was washing her, etc.However, after using the tub about 10 times, it suddenly collapsed into the bottom of the sink with my baby inside. Basically, the top and bottom ends that fold up for storage just buckled. She wasn't hurt, but was very scared. Keep in mind that this problem started when my baby was 12 lbs - so I don't think her weight was an issue."
3,Does the job but isn't the best.,"We bought this because we lived in an apt. and needed something that wasn't bulky. The price was right at the time as well. Now that I will be using it for a second child, I am reconsidering the purchase. My first daughter was always frigid in the tub because the spongy stuff on the back got wet and cold. It doesn't really have any of the bells and whistles of the other tubs and no hammock for smaller newborns. My daughter didn't use it long before we gave up and I just bathed her with me. Spend the extra money and deal with the bulk."
3,"Compact, but be careful!","I like this tub because it folds up and is stored more easily than the larger tubs. However, when my son is sitting in the tub in our sink, sometimes the ends of the tub that are meant to fold will snap (and start to fold up) and the loud noise will startle him. It seems that the locks that hold the tub in the open position are not strong enough (if your baby is over 10 pounds, this is when this started for me).This tub also doesn't hold a lot of water, which starts to become a problem as your baby gets bigger."
4,Great Tub!,"This tub is great if you're concerned with space. I can let it dry, fold it up and put it under the bassinet in my room so it's close at hand for the next bath.On the other hand, the water does spill over where the notches are to fold the tub if you fill it a bit too much. You can't add very much water because of that. Otherwise my son seems to like it and I haven't had any safety problems what-so-ever. As far as putting it in the sink, I wouldn't do that with any tub. It doesn't seem safe. Therefore I place the tub on the bathroom counter next to the sink."
5,Safety 1st Space Saver Baby Tub,"This tub was perfect for my baby. It kept him upright laying slghtly. There is a small slot by the feet for small toys to play with while bathing. In addition, the fold-up feature made it easy for storing. The foam did not allow my son to slip at all. The fact that a small amount of water can be filled near his bottom allows the freedom to bath him by gently soaking a wash cloth. Later you can drain the tub through an opening at the bottom of the tub."
4,A Pop Masterpiece,"Love this CD! It is chock full of catchy melodies and trippy lyrics. You will hear these songs in your head for days! Much better than their other CD. For $2.50 (postage included), it's a bargain."
1,NOT WHAT I WANTED,so i ordered this mirror for my car and it turns out to be way too big even though it was supposed to be sized for my car... i didnt even bother sending it back... iw was too pissed and i dont have time for that....
3,A bit of a disappointment,"This should have been published with another story or two (there are some uncollected Lythande stories, maybe the administrators of her estate should look into a complete Lythande collection, including the Thieve's World stories). It's just a novelette - really a long short story.As a story of Lythande, it is thin and lacks the complexity of the other stories. It was good to see Beeauty and Tashgan again. I'm glad to add it to my collection of MZB."
2,u r clue less,"J.P is Jeff Porcaro.Mr. Carlton had a deep respect for this true musician.I can hardly believe J.P. 's been gone for almost 16 years.Session dudes are brought in for good reason .These two Brought an incred-able amount of stuff .Anyway Carlton is a First Rate Player. Listen to all his music {find credits at his site}.Watch him and the group of pros he gets to play with, then rewrite your review."
5,Intriguing,"In ""Little White Lies"", Janet and Ron Benrey have created a totally likable heroine, Pippa Hunnechurch. This British import, a hard-working, savvy headhunter, finds herself, while struggling to save her agency, suddenly caught in the middle of murder. With the help of her one-of-a-kind secretary, Gloria, Pippa sorts through the tangle of little while lies to find the truth. The end is both exciting and satisfying, and I, for one, hope Pippa returns soon with further adventures."
4,Little White Lies,"As you know, little whit lies have a tendency to turn into big problems, and so it is with Pippa. The plot is believable but quick enough to keep your full attention. I like my characters to sound like someone I would like to know and I would like to get to know Pippa a bit better. I look forward to her next adventure."
3,Very Slow,"I really enjoyed the Benreys' other series and so I decided to give this one a try. While the book wasn't bad, it was very slow. It seemed to take forever to get interesting and really plodded along. Nothing exciting really happened until the very end. While you don't necessarily know which of four women is the murderer, its pretty clear what will happen. The Christian message was also pretty weak. I might try another in the series, but I won't buy it. Pippa isn't an unlikeable character, but the plot just moves too slow to really pull you in. I keep putting the book down and then completely forgetting about it."
2,"Not Exactly ""Wowed""","Although I think the basic premise of the story was good, I was really a bit disappointed by the transparency of the plot, as well as some of the plodding narrative. I did find that the intended spiritual message, was in fact present, albeit slightly unconvincing. Sorry, but I just wasn't *pulled in* at any point, to this story.I've heard that Pippa Hunnechurch may appear again in a future novel by Ron and Janet Benrey. As an avid mystery reader, and especially of those with a British flair, I'd be willing to give this character another try. So hopefully, Pippa's second time out will be a much smoother and enjoyable read."
4,Great CD,Lovers of Joao's smooth jazzy sounds will love the ballads on this album - at least 4 tracks - of which Vida Noturna and Transversal do Tempo are notable.
4,A Chinese Experiment with Democracy,"Unusual in the sense that these true-to-life people seem to be living in some kind of Chinese paradise--complete with pristine streets, sensitive teachers, a modern tram, lots of good food, stylish clothes, American slang and some latent appreciation of democratic values. From an entertainment perspective, these kids and their parents are truly a hoot! Recommended."
3,it's OK,"the game I really liked called, generates accurate data of the geography of Venezuela and its history. I did not like"
1,Does not work at all,When you turn this game on it gets to the start screen and freezes. I have looked at forums on line and at the EA website and it turns out this is a very common and known problem. EA says there is no workaround and no plans to come up with one. Basically the game is a brick. I had this game for PS2 and it works fine and was very excited to try it on the PS3 but was very disappointed when I got it and found all this out. They shouldn't even sell this game anymore if there is no plan to make it work again.
3,1st game i gotten and its horrible,I use to have the ps2 and the original mercernaries. So i thought the sequel was going to be better but its sloppy work from the developers. Couldve been better...
3,Clouds of nuclear smoke and burning rubble obscure the technical gaffes.,"As above, Mercenaries 2 has some serious technical issues and is riddled with bugs, but the freedom to level cities makes it (almost) worth the price of entry.Bugs include disappearing secret kits, horrid AI, various visual and collision detection glitches, and a general lack of polish on the parts of the game that don't involve calling in an airstrike. But then again, those airstrikes are way fun to call in. Your mileage may vary."
3,Lots of glitches,"When I first started playing this game I really liked it. After getting into it I repeatedly find myself disappointed. There are glitches everywhere. I cannot complete 4 or 5 missions without something to prevent my progress. The game has frozen up several times, enemy hvt's that you're supposed to transport back to base get lost in the backdrop. One even got stuck in the air way out of reach. I've become so frustrated with restarting missions I've given up on this game. I wouldnt recommend buying this game."
2,It's fun despite itself,"It is nice to be able to blow everything up. I like the ability to land on boats with a helicopter and steal the boat, and I like the fact that it draws objects really far away. With this game, though, the glitches and **stupid button combinations you have to do to hijack vehicles** (I won't buy a Mercenaries 3 because of this) kind of make you want to blow the game itself up. The NPCs are dumb as toast. Getting them in and out of vehicles was easier in the first game. The physics seem to be only slightly better than the first game.Bottome Line: This game can be a lot of fun, its got some re-play value as well, but its not worth $60. Factoring in the frustration from being kicked off a tank time and time because you didn't press X fast enough, and having civilians leap out at your speeding vehicle like depressed lemmings, this game is worth about $15-$20"
2,aburrido,"El juego es muy aburrido los gráficos no son muy buenos, lo único divertido del juego es la imagen q t formas de la historia pero de verdad es muy fastidioso jugarlo"
3,Things Go Boom,"Essentially this game is for those who like to blow stuff up. I happen to be one of those people. I mean what else are video game for if not for that. That being said this game does not have an immersive story line or great characters or any of those other fun story things that make a great game. It is a fun game, it is explosive, and it is ridiculous but overall I gave it the 3 stars for being fun but not a great game"
1,Do Not Buy for Online Play,"Bought this game to play with a friend who is one of those cranky people who leaves one-star ratings because of fluke issues (see review dated November 18, 2011). Seriously, though, he is absolutely correct. The game is unplayable in online/co-op mode because of a lack of support from EA Games. In fact, their support site doesn't even allow you to chat with them because this game is not listed in a mandatory field on their form."
3,Overall,The first mercenaries was fun so I decided to buy this one. It was pretty good and the graphic were great. But buy the time I had bought it the online servers had been shut down so I havent got to play it online.
2,I've played less buggy betas then this,"This game should not have been released yet with the number of bugs present. There's too many to list here (about 13 pages listed on the games main forum), but they include things such as corrupted saves, enemies no longer attacking you until you start a new game, several graphical glitches, falling through the ground, coop not working...the list just goes on and on. For me this game is almost impossible to enjoy being left-handed, due to not having the ability to modify the controls and the aim being stuck to the right joystick.The game has a lot of potential when the bugs are all fixed. If you're willing to brush off all the nuisances caused by the glitches, then buy this game, otherwise, wait until the team manages to overhaul this game and stick to playing the first game. This goes for all consoles pc included. All are equally bugged and in need of serious patching."
3,Many hours of game time but loads of errors in the game.,Fun game but it has loads of glitches. Lots of programming issues but nothing too horrible.
1,Mercenaries 2 - EA no longer supports online so it Freezes,"I bought this game, it looked fun but as soon as I put the disc in, it freezes on the loading. I have since read that EA no longer supports the game online, so first off, you cannot do anything online with this, so its only a one player game, no online. For me that was fine as I only wanted to play the single player version but it freezes regardless. I have read that you should unplug or disable the internet so it will not go looking for EA, I did that, but its still freezing and I have yet to play even a second of this game that I just bought. I guess if Amazon cannot help me to get it working I will have to return it."
1,Unplayable - freezes at load screen,I read the reviews that said the game would not go past the load screen and ignored them. Bad call on my part. Don't make the same mistake.
5,Best Game ever,I love it. I like it mostly because there is some free roaming in it. I am a big fan of shooting random civilians and the bad guys and good guys. I enjoy taking cars and choppers. I am also a fan of BIG EXPLOSIONS and DESTRUCTION. I love the game.
4,Mindless Distractions at their Best,"This is an awesome game, I don't care what anyone else says. The graphics are decent, but not perfect. The story line sounds like something you'd hear on CNN and leaves a bit to be desired. The reason I like this game so much is the ability to go anywhere, do whatever, and blow up everything. It's the perfect game to end a long day.Overall, this game wouldn't win any awards for being unique in any way, but it's one of the best mindless distractions available for PS3"
4,I would like to have played it more,"Not the best ps3 graphics but it came out a long time ago. Definately worth the $10-15 it's going for now a days. I haven't gotten the online to work because my ISP blocks p2p ports such as are used by this game, but the single player is a lot of fun."
3,A little small!,"It was a little smaller than I had expected. A month later at Tuesday Morning they had a larger one for $2.99, that was definitely a better deal, too bad I had already ordered this one."
4,webkinz lion,I like this webkinz alot it is very cute.But it took forever to get here I was very mad.It's smaller than I thought it would beand I know it is a lil'kinz.And it's fur where the mane is sticks up.over all it's agood toy
4,Mad/happy,I like the webkinz very much it's very cute. I'm very mad becauses it took forever to get shipped evon when was it took forever to be deliverd.
4,Good but narrow overview,I would have liked to have stories about illnesses also in the book. Also couple mistakes found. But still good value for money.
1,Articles have similar themes every month,"I do not like that the quality of the magazine has drastically diminished.Even 4 to 5 years ago, they had in depth, thought-provoking articles that were insightful and interesting!Some were dense and hard to understand but had novel themes that were not often discussed and therefore broadened my exposure to different ideas in science. Now, the themes seem to circulate every few months and the articles all meld into one long summary.They are all ""dumb-ed"" down so to speak and are no longer as engaging. Instead of being the mid level mag between something like Discover and Nature mags, it is nothing more than an elementary review of science topics. I am very disappointed and will be cancelling my subscription.Have ppl become so disinterested in science that its (presumed) loss in revenue has caused it to PACK the magazine with ads?? :(SAVE your money and subscribe to American Scientist!!!"
2,Selling out and a loss of scientific astuteness,"I subscribed to this magazine for a number of years and found that it was really a delight to read. I was interested in science and the magazine challenged my knowledge as a student. I learned a great deal from this magazine over the years but in the recent years the quality has gone down substantially. The pages are beautiful to look at but the content has been dumbed down to the level of a tabloid. No more is the witty humor of the authors and the authority that used to come across in the material. I have discontinued my subscription and moved onto ""American Scientist"" which has not sold out the true science to sell magazines. I wish that Scientific American would learn that there are people out there who are really very interested in science and want an intellectual look into topics not a superficial glance."
1,Gone left and unscientific,"This once outstanding magazine has drifted left in outlook and bias. Articles reflect this bias, and worsenow many are closer to science fiction that science fact. After many years as a subscriber I am saddenedby the continuing decline of this publication and will give American Scientist a go. By By (Un-)ScientificAmerican..... visit my mail box No More!"
2,"4 STARS, if the magazine gets delivered","I have been a subscriber for at least the last ten years, but last December I ceased my subscription and two gift subscriptions because only half of the issues were arriving, to me, and to my gift subscribers. By content the magazine would be 4 stars in my estimate, down from 5 stars some years ago. But since I only got half my magazines without having to write a number of emails and my gift subscribers mostly just gave up, I have rated it 2 stars, and have said ""Farewell.""Scientific American (1-year auto-renewal)"
5,Science for Everyone,"I love science, technology and engineering. I think it is important for every American to some basic understanding of science and what science brings to our society. Scientific American provides great information about the latest in science that is accessible to the non-scientist. It a great source to keep up with what is going on in science."
5,Keeping abreast with our life on earth,For anyone who wishes to be more involved with our life on earth whether it be our planet and how it was formed or the health of our body Scientific American walks you down the paths of your interest with fascinating articles to captivate each of us.
1,Charged for 12 issues - delivered 9 issues,The subscription was for 12 issues - I only received 9 issues and was informed that my subscription has expired. How do you do math? American math?
1,Crashed and burned.,"How can environmental science have 2-3 worthy breakthroughs/month deserving of the classic SciAm recognition? SciAm used to be leading edge stuff. It was like winning the Nobel to have a paper chosen for publication.My subscription expires in June 2012. After 40-some years, SciAm and I will go our separate ways. I've already subscribed to American Scientist."
2,Dumbed down fluff,"In their attempt to gain a larger audience, they seem to be turning this once great publication into another mass-media, no real content glossy mag.Some articles appear to have mistakes and factual omissions, and we wonder if some of the authors understood the subject themselves. Too many pages of flashy artwork."
1,Canceled My Subscription anbd Got A Refund,I have canceled my subscription and got a refund as I will vote with my pocketbook.I suggest that others who do not like what this magazine has become do the same.Do not support such tin foil hatted self indulgent buffoonery.This magazine is now a waste of time and money.I give it 3-5 years before it folds.
5,Magazine subscription renewal,Purchasing a renewal of this magazine was very easy. It is an extension of a current subscription so cannot verify if it has been extended yet. Hopefully all will go well
1,one month later still have not gotten magazine,Can not review as still not have received the magazine!!!Over a month is a long time
1,"Sadly, once good, now a pawn of the liberal elite",I once loved this magazine - my subscription has run out - I will not renew. Pay close attention to the reviews here that note that SA now uses its power as a Science Authority to support a political ideology and now ignores the value of open debate on scientific issues. Truly a sad development - I hope SA wakes up and returns to its egalitarian roots - big interests and money is not the answer.
2,Changed for the worse,"I used to love Scientific American in the 70s and 80s and saved all the issues. But I started noticing a fundamental dilemma: each issue had an article that was superficially science but mainly political, and always of a left-wing nature. If they labeled these articles as editorials, there would be no problem, but they always tried to pass them off as scientific truth. I dropped out. Then I started a subscription recently in order to not lose my airline miles. The January 2010 issue was a big disappointment. About half the articles had political messages, much worse than in the 80s. How sad to see a great magazine taken over by political ideologues."
1,Magazine would taste as good as it reads.,"Magazine is not technical, did not expect it to be.It is just boring and uninteresting. I like science andwant to learn new things. This magazine seems to suck the lifeout of anything interesting. Most articles at leastin the July issue seem to be left wing propaganda. Way toomuch editorial commentary to promote a agenda. Idon't care about their politics."
2,If you can get past the politics......,"I read SciAm for many years but had to end my subscription because I could no longer stomach the political slant.If you can get past the politics, or perhaps agree with it, then this is a pretty good magazine for the casual scientist."
3,"Good for what it is, but...","Brief, but useful information on the major sites around the Italian lakes. Construction of this book was poor with pages cut at a strange angle and still sealed together on the lower edge, but the information about phone numbers, entry fees and hours for attractions was helpful. A good book for those who just want to hit the highlights and move on. For more in depth descriptions and out-of-the-way places, use Lombardy and the Italian Lakes, 4th Edition by Dana Facaros, Michael Pauls."
1,The Population Bomb is a Dud,"I read the Population Bomb when it first came out, and believed it. Paul Ehrlich envisioned a horrific future with mass starvation of millions, if not billions of people by 1995. As we now know, Ehrlich was a Malthusian of the worst order, and almost single-handedly gave environmentalists a bad name. He is the epitome of an alarmist who has significantly harmed the ability of reasonable environmentalists to be taken seriously (The Boy Who Cried Wolf Syndrome). I'm sure Dr. Ehrlich meant well, but boy, was he wrong. This book should rest in peace, never to be read again. Or, perhaps it could be read as a lesson learned in how to avoid making extremist statements that make you and your colleagues look stupid."
5,Love it,I totally love this watch. It is much nicer and more beautiful than I thought when I bought it for a very fair price.
3,Didn't read description well before ordering,"I ordered this at the same time I ordered the keep warm dish. I thought this would be the same concept, not that it must be filled with hot water. Perhaps when the grandchildren come over it will find use."
4,Hot Graphics is hot,Great hard-back book with many large quality photographs. Also a nice range of graphics from packaging to architecture design. Fun to look at over and over again. A nice addition to your library.
3,good but not great,"Mates,Dates and Tempting Trouble book #8 had a good plot but throughout the book started getting a bit odd. For one thing Luke, the boy Nesta has been dating, seems much different from the book before, Mates, Dates, and Sequin Smiles. Also this book just didn't have the same feel as the other books. The others felt comfortable this one felt somewhat desperate."
1,Great title but it's a very disappointing book.,"I had great expectations when I ordered this book based on it's title - but it quickly disappointed. On page 39 under the heading PATENTS it explains that ""A patent is a time-limited, exclusive right that is granted for an invention"" duh? I think I already KNEW THAT! You get the picture? It's a very elementary book - you'd have to be absolutely green not to know most of the stuff in this book. Except for the fact that half of it is full of legal blurb about Geneva convention, Rome convention, Nairobi(?) Treaty and loads of useless information. Nothing dynamic about how companies with a decent patent portfolio can ACTUALLY capitalise or profit as the title suggests. A useless book."
5,Like Gold Refinded,this book is so great. i loved it. i hope Janette okedoes write another series. or is there already ?
3,Same smell I love but doesn't last long,"I have loved this perfume for years...the smell is unique and I've always gotten compliments. I've even had men smell me and ask what I was wearing so they could buy it for their wives/girlfriends. What I loved most was that the scent would last all day! This is the first time I have purchased the perfume since it hasn't been available in stores, and I am disappointed that the perfume is now very weak and lasts only a couple hours. The smell is still great, but I didn't expect to spend this much on a perfume to have to reapply it every couple hours. Dior needs to step it up with this one because it used to be an amazing product. Unfortunately it now seems to be a cheap product, but with the high price tag."
4,Lovely fragrance,"This is my favorite ""recent"" addition to my fragrance stock. I feel I can wear it either day or night. I rated it a '4' as it doesn't last long, but still plan on purchasing a larger size."
1,Disappointed!,"This body lotion does not smell like the perfume !!! I was really disappointed!!!I love the perfume and it was a reason to get the body lotion, but it has another smell!!!"
3,not what i expected,I bought this fragrance to test it. It was a little to heavy for my tastes. However it did last all day... it just wasnt for me.
3,cute shoes,"These are some of the cutest shoes my daughter has! However, they are very hard to put on! The back is always folding in, making the process of putting shoes on, very long...especially for slip on shoes."
5,Cute Shoe,"Love this shoe, nice to find something comfortable and stylish for boys! He had a similar pair in grey that my son outgrew, unfortunately the 5 1/2 I received seems to run big. So he has not been able to wear these yet, but I like too much to return! He got a lot of wear out of the other pair and I'm sure he will out of these too."
3,DELICIOUSLY DISSAPOINTING..,"In all honesty i had high hopes for this book,i was mildly disapointerd at the lack of real vision.Though true to its calling (NEW TRANSLATION)it doesnt go beyond updating the song into the language of the day.I did however like the fact that they used hebrew lettering on the opposite page of the english trans, verse by verse.I would recomend this book to one who wants to speculate,disect,and tinker with the greatest love poem ever.Could have had more pictures/illustrations for readers to visualize this visualy intensive poem."
4,"Fine Translation, Thin Volume","The Blochs' translation is concise, elegant, and strikes the right balance between contemporary explicitness and classical reserve. Some of the textual choices are debatable, and the translation often departs from literalness, sometimes omitting entire lines -- but the overall result is fresh and exciting; this nuanced rendition really brings the Song to life.One thing to be aware of is that, other than the poem itself, a brief introduction, and some brief remarks by Robert Alter, the text consists mostly of very detailed translators' notes analyzing the verses line by line, even word by word. This material will be of interest to scholars of ancient Hebrew but perhaps not to the general reader. I read the book (sans notes) in about forty minutes -- and I have to wonder if I should have paid [amt] for the privelege. Nothing against the Blochs or their fine work, but I would have preferred more supporting material of more general interest."
3,Am a bit disappointed,This book disappointed me. The book contains a lot of wildlife pictures and lot of great close-ups (They are absolutely great). But it does not have a lot about the scenic beauty of Vermont. And the landscape photos are not as great as the close-ups or wildlife. And its expensive.I loved the author's other book The Photographers Guide to Vermont.
1,UGH,"I am currently on day 73 of using this product twice a day according to directions. I apply it and massage it into my thin edges really gently until its all absorbed into my scalp like the directions say. But guess what?? I have seen absolutely NO change in my hairline. It's still as thin as it was before I started! I know that this product states that this is supposed to be a 90 day process, but I am to think by day 73 I would see at least a LITTLE change...but nope I haven't. It's sad that I wasted $13 on a product that doesn't work for me. *sigh* It smells really good and i love how it doesn't clog my hair follicles...but that's the only good thing I can say about it. What a waste of my time :( ..oh and my money!!!"
1,Didn't do a thing,"I used two bottles of this stuff and it didn't do a thing. I also used a jar of the temple balm (which is supposed to do the same thing) and that didn't work either.This stuff is snake oil. Don't waste your money. If you want to regrow your hair, you better get some Rogaine."
4,Bad Company - Good Story,"Four Big Sheriff's Stars for this production! I love westerns, particualrly set in this time ""when the west was young,"" the 1860's - loved the soundtrack, loved the stark natural locations, loved the wit and literacy of the dialogue. The story moves right along, the characters are interesting. The director and writer draw us in to a world transforming where silly harmless pranks evolve into deadly serious crimes. I am getting to be a bit of a ""cinema geek"" in spotting tiny details. The handguns, nearly every one I saw, were 1873 model Colts (or a similar configuration). The time setting was for the film was 1863 - full decade before such firearms were available to the public. That's my only beef."
4,realistic west,"This is a good but unusual western that is more realistic than your typical western. Worthwhile, if your not expecting ""young guns!"""
2,poor quality,"my son received this for christmas and only played with it for literally 10 minutes, when he went back to play with it again it no longer functioned normally...and he did nothing to it that would have caused this. The top of the bulldozer has 6 buttons, all of which do different things...but the 2 buttons that make the truck move forward or backward no longer work correctly. the sound goes off like the truck is moving, but it just sits there. sometimes with a little help it'll move, but this is not how it was designed. I even tried brand new batteries. there is no information about how to contact the manufacturer, Toy State Industrial LTD, out of Hong Kong. The only thing we can try now is to hope the store will except an exchange if they have another one...we'd hate to not get another one cause he does like, it just doen't work right anymore."
4,Burden of Truth,"Circle II Circle is a band totally flying under the radar. If you are a fan of Heavy Metal, Hard Rock or Melodic Rock, this is a band you need to check out. The vocals are strong and powerful. The musicianship is also quality. Who am I To Be, A Matter of Time & Sentenced are really strong songs. The band keeps the song first and foremost and the band members will each get their moment to shine through out the record. Once again this is a REALLY good band. It is a shame the music industry has went the way it has. This is a band that should be HUGE. Very few people by albums now. They just want a single....so sad."
5,Circle II Circle Masters of Melodic Metal/Rock,"As what alot of people already have said, this cd is their best to date. First off the production on this cd is incredible, Zak Stevens voice is superb, and the rest of the band are tight! Every song on this cd are great no fillers here. The first song ""Who am I to Be' is a perfect example. If you own the other cd's then this is a ""MUST HAVE"". One of the best from 2006!!."
3,Different water bottle,"This is certainly a cool and attention-getting water bottle. Be aware that the two-liter size is very large and probably too big for every day use. Because it is not rigid, you need two hands to drink from it (or spill it all over yourself.) Can be frozen."
4,Pretty much as expected.,"There are only two cons that I have found. 1) It is pretty much impossible to clean in any fashion other than putting soap & water in it and shaking it. 2) The bottom plastic kind of crimps up weird when trying to collapse it down if you're not paying attention, and I think that eventually it'll break, but it's held up so far. I've been using it for about a month now.It's definitely a conversation piece; I've gotten several compliments/questions at my gym (most common comment is that it looks like an IV bag). It's very useful and I like how small it is. Water isn't dis-flavored because of it (like Nalgene bottles). It's relatively easy to use once you get used to it. If you wanted to use if for anything other than the gym, I'd highly recommend one of the bigger ones, as .5L is not a lot.Overall, it's useful, it's cheap, it works, it's unique, and that's about it. What more could you ask?"
4,"Compact, easy-to-use, great overall","I read about these water bottles in an article that recommended them because they do not leech plasticizers into the water if reused or if you store water in them. I have since fallen in love with this water bottle. the 0.5L size is perfect - I have a 1.0L bottle and it is too large and cumbersome for me. Easily refillable, and I have never had to wash the ""bottle"" portion because the water starts to taste bad (as in a Nalgene bottle).My only complaint would be that I have squirted myself in the face a couple of times - when I first was learning to use it. And the top is a little bit hard to close because you don't have the rigidity in the bottle as you would with a solid bottle. But overall, I love it. I've actually come back to buy a couple more - so cheap and they are really durable. A great bargain."
3,Convenient for taking extra water,"Pros:1) easy extra water container to take for travelingCons:1) harder to clean once if it gets dirty inside2) keep track of the cap and ensure it's closed before trying to stuff it somewhere :p3) at times a pita to fillOverall I liked it and would use it on our next trip. I use it as an extra water source. Once the water bottles get low, I refill from the platypus and it folds away easily."
5,platypus 1.0 liter bottle,"Hate for little children to have to drink out of containers that add not-good substances to the water. Platypus containers impart no taste, and the water keeps for days without getting nasty. Good stuff. Definitely need the push-pull top instead of the screw-top. Kind of big for the pocket, but holds a lot."
2,Not that great,"This bag looked fun, but remember that it takes two hands to drink from it because it is not rigid. (Can't use it biking or driving.) And after I washed it, the nondescript cap went missing--probably tossed in the garbage like all other plastic caps. (Replacement cap is $3 plus shipping.)It's tricky to wash and difficult to get dry inside."
4,Great bottle but hard to clean,"I prefer metal bottles with mouths wide enough to scrub, because this little one is a pain to clean, but it is bpa-free and very convenient so I still recommend it. This is a good alternative when portability is an issue, can even fold it up and stick it in your pocket when you go to stadiums and then fill up inside (from those that haven't removed their water fountains to rip you off even further)."
5,A charming and memorable storybook for beginning readers,"Recommended for children ages 2 to 6, No Haircut Today! is an entertainingly written and illustrated picturebook by Elivia Savadier, and tells the warm and charming story of a young, scraggly-haired boy who does not like to get his hair cut. When Dominic sees scissors, he screams! His mother is very upset. But she loves him, and even if he does not get a haircut today, he just might tomorrow! The simple story and the striking, free-form illustrations make No Haircut Today! a charming and memorable storybook for beginning readers."
2,Not a fan,"I bought this book for my 2 and a half year old son. He has never had a haircut and is afraid to go. My hope in buying this book was that it would help him overcome his fear. However, the book did just the opposite since the little boy in the book is afraid to go as well. By the end of the book, the little boy is still afraid to go. I would have hoped that the opposite would have occurred. Cute book if you just want to read for fun but won't help your child overcome his fear of the first haircut. At least, did not for mine."
1,Don't Think this is the right information!!,"I am looking for a Hepa Filter for Kenmore 85254 Air Cleaner, part number is 83195 per manual. I can tell you that while this looks correct in the photo the measurements are not correct for the hepa filter that I have now, which was the original. And since the cost of this filter is soooo much cheaper I am leery as to whether this information is correct, just saying."
3,Cabinet,The item was marred on the front right out of the box. Required painting. Other than that it serves it purpose well but seems a bit over priced.
2,Not so much art as rhetoric,I bought this book to help interest my 3-year-old daughter in the Bible stories I tell her. I thought it would have more art in it! But it is mostly a text of the author's thoughts.
4,sims2 cast away for ps2,i love this game first time i bought i stayed up for 14 hours just to play and the second day i played all day i forgot to eat. the only thing i dont like about it is that to go to the other island it takes to long . when it loads it takes a long time . even to sleep in the game it takes too. it takes too long to finish one stage because of the loading. i would definitely buy another one if they made a 3rd one .
4,great game for girls,"So many ps2 games are boy oriented. My daughter has found a games she loves! She also has the book that goes with it. I highly recommend getting the book. The main drawback, you can only save 1 player. Boy is my son bummed."
5,LOVE IT!!!!,"I just got this game and it's fabulous! You can explore different places on the island, play and talk to chimpanzees and make your own crew! I love it and any Sims 2 lover should definitely buy it!"
4,Simms 2 castaway,The game was in very good shape. t was taken good care of. Would buy again. Was a gift for my granddaughter.
5,Great!,"I love this game so much! It was cheap, and shipped and arrived a week before it was due. I'm so excited to play it!"
1,Game had to be returned,The game was great but the disc itself wasn't. The game would play for no more than an hour without freezing. It would always freeze on the same parts of the game. I had to save constantly or keep starting from the last saved point. The game was used but didn't look very scratched. I would buy this game new not used.
2,Not as good,"I recently bought The Sims 2 Castaway ps2, and It was fun... for about 30 minutes. Now, I'm a big Sim fan, and have beat many of the their games, but this one just doesn't measure up the the older versions. Yes, it is different, and has alot of interesting things to do, but it gets pretty boring, especially since there is no 2 player. It's all you, all alone, and it will lose your interest quickly.If you want to experience The Sims correctly, But the original The sims for ps2 or Com, The Sims 2 for com, or The Sims Busting Out ps2. You won't be disappointed!"
4,EMPIRE EARTH II DEMO,"The game is great however this is a prerelease demo, not the actual game, beware of this to avoid disappointment"
4,not so traumatic as it sounds,"I have loved this film for years. First of all, it has my all time favorite actress, mama (I forget the lady who plays her's name, but she is dead). The plot is really rather good, the comedy is right on target, not TOO vulger, and of course it ends nicely!"
2,Dissappointed in this Product,I bought this for my brother. He just wanted a train that looked like the Disney train for around his Christmas Tree. Unfortunately this was very low quality. It only worked about 75% of the time. When you picked up the cars the wheels would fall off. Very upsetting for how much money it was. The only reason why this got 2 stars was because it looked very cool. I just wish it was built with higher quality.I sent this back within a few days. I recommend spending a little bit more and getting a nicer train.
2,Features your BELLY,"Unless your belly is as flat as a board, this shirt will feature however much projects outward to the world as though it were on stage and illuminated by a spotlight. The curved bottom line of the top colored section affords the look of a late-term pregnancy.If you're OK with such a presentation, then this may be the shirt for you!..."
3,"VHS ""New Age""","Well, I bought this tape, because I have not been able to find it on DVD. I hope it will be published soon. However, now I do not have a VHS player and I don't want one. I am looking for someone to convert this to DVD for me. But this was a facinating, dark, moody movie and I think a great deal of it."
4,FINALLY!!,"Freak reminded me so much of the earlier books. Gaia's relationship with Jake finally begins to take some actual hold, and i can honestly say i had butterflies in my stomach in some of the situations Gaia was put in (Sam + Ed + Jake + Gaia in the same room can only = awkwardness.)This book truly goes to show that no one is who they seem as new characters are revealed and old characters make a return appearance. I'm so glad to finally see Pascal focusing on the relationships in the series... It had me on the edge of my seat (and by seat, i mean bed,) and i'm counting down the seconds until the next one."
5,DO NOT READ THE INTRODUCTION FIRST!!!,"A truly great book, wonderfully written, with many dramatic moments. Unfortunately the introduction is written by a bore who gives away most of the best moments. If you want to truly enjoy this book as written by the author save the introduction for last (if at all)."
4,Independent People,"Independent PeopleI gave this book 4 stars only because it's a fairly tough read. The author's prose and poetry is absolutely beautiful. Truly, his writing is magical. However, the story itself can be frustrating - the main character just doesn't move forward in life - he's doomed by his own independence. If you are a reader who loves really well written books, read on, but if you are someone who wants to ""feel good"" after reading, you might stay away from Independent People. One other note, in the new release, the introduction is basically a ""Cliff Notes"" of the book. I would not recommend reading this until AFTER reading the entire book."
5,"MY FAVORITE BOOK, EVER. HAUNTING CHARACTERS. HAUNTING EVERYTHING.","Halldor Laxness won the 1955 Nobel Prize with this one. It's the story of Bjartur, an indentured servant who purchased his freedom with 18 years of hard work. Bjartur sets out to be truly independent by owning his own farm-- which happens to be cursed. This saga dissects the Icelandic social system, Bjartur's psyche (& those of all other characters), & illustrates the effects of war and greed on both. E. Annie Proulx, Jane Smiley & I agree: I think it's one of the best books ever written. Don't read the Introduction. Its author gives away too much."
5,godd bless,I dont know that thing of reversing the scandinavians back to be catholic..but man...man!!!!this genius won that Stalin's literature award for The Atom Station and The Nobel as well...and between a couple of hundered sheep and an iclandic state of mind (nature )..the iceland state of mind better say..there is a leftover priest sitting on turgenev's gravesaying..what did u say again...can't hear ya..what did u say..Dude..what a killer book...absolutely outstanding..no I mean really..what to say after this..just please dudes..dont write anymore if u don't have to..God Bless u Lexness..U were really something around herelove ya
2,What's The Deal Here?,"First, don't read the introduction if you don't want to know what happens. Second, the author would skip many weeks (or months) at a time when it seemed that this timeframe was crucial to the story line. Such as when he returned from a 4-5 month absence. He had left his daughter to attend to the household and she was anxiously waiting for the day that he would return. It tells of him returning over the familiar hills and his thoughts. The next chapter he's been home for awhile and there is nothing about her reaction on his return. Also, the conflict between the father and daughter doesn't actual materialize significantly until your about three quarters of the way through. Some terms weren't familiar to me, such as croft, which made it a little slow going at the beginning. Otherwise, the writing itself was very descriptive and I guess this is what got him the Nobel prize."
2,Live thru several long Icelandic winters--BORING,"Well, I hate to sound unsophisticated, but I for one missed the reason this book earned a Nobel Prize for the author. It is an epic of despair, which could easily have been written in 1/3 the pages. I found the plot completely unengaging."
4,Powerful and Often Funny,"This novel looks nostalgically at rural life in Iceland and regrets the effects of a market economy on rural people with simple wants and needs. The protagonist, Bjartur of Summerhouses, is an obstinate, reactionary, and sometimes cruel herdsman who nonetheless possesses fine perception. Through this book, we learn a lot about the ecology of Iceland (it's a nice place to visit but don't try to raise sheep there), Bjartur, his family, and the society he belongs to. Author Halldor Laxness makes you appreciate the difficulties these people face but can also make you laugh out loud when he satirizes Bjartur's neighbors and the local gentry. I was impressed with this book and read many passages to my family. Unfortunately, there are also parts of the book where not much of interest happens for what seems like 50 or 75 pages at a time. I'm tempted to say that this would have been a better book if it were shorter but then Laxness won the Nobel Prize for literature and I didn't."
2,"Fascinating, but ultimately boring and mean-spirited","I stopped reading this half way through, because it was too depressing and slow.I've though of it several times since though, especially when my Mom mentions something about geneaology, etc. This gave me a very strong emotional and visual impression of what it was like to be a lonely homestead farmer in the late 1700s in Iceland.The main character though is one of my least favorite people ever imagined (what a grump!) and while it was an interesting read, it never put me in a good place or was that enjoyable."
2,Tediously Boring,"I fall into the same camp as those that have given this book a low review. The book is boring. It is extremely hard to read, what with dealing with unfamiliar names and terms compounded by the terrible book to Kindle conversion.I quit when I found myself begging for the book to end, only to find I was half way through it. It was beneficial in getting me to sleep earlier, so I'll give it two stars."
5,Loving Donna,"I bought this album randomly, & absolutely love it> I play it non stop in my home as well as during my yoga classes. It really lifts you up, and is wonderful to sing alon with. I was raving about it to friends when I heard that Donna would be in South Beach, at a yoga center to lead the savasana and meditation. Eagerly I attended & felt blessed to participate in the devotional chanting. Donna has a beautiful spirit, in person she is a shining light of devotion, and her passion is accurately captured on this cd. The addition of groovy percussion makes this a real winner."
3,"Great Headlights, short life","I've been using these headlights for the past 2 years now. I have to replace them probably once every 3 months, maybe 4. Amazon shipped the item to me fast and the headlight was in great shape (amazon itself gets 5 stars for this). If you don't mind forking out the $20.00 per headlight every few months, get them. These headlights definitely improve visibility and they look a lot better than those old yellowish lights."
