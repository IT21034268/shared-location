1,Returned THREE TIMES for broken 'drive train',"While I DID like the balance and power of this, the drive shaft became disengaged from the motor on THREE seperate units! A weak link I guess. What is almost as infuriating is OSH, when asked if others were having problems with this model, played dumb on several occasions."
4,Powerful for an electric,"Just as Consumer Reports says, this trimmer is as powerful as most consumer gas models, and easy to change into edging mode. Uses 0.80 string, heavier than some models and less likely to break when it strikes a tree or rock. The only negative with this--and with any electric--is that you have to drag the extension cord around, and are limited to the 100 feet from the outlet unless you join two cords, which reduces power somewhat."
1,Loser! Too much time spent adjusting string length!,"I'm spending much more time respooling the stringer line, than I am whacking any grass! Very poor product! I do better with a machete! Ugh! Yuck!"
1,Not durable,"First day using this something broke inside. The motor would turn, but the cutter head wouldn't. I also had line feed problems. I would not recommend anyone get this."
1,Would have rated 0 stars if I could,"This is the biggest POS lawn equipment I have ever had. I used to have a single line grasshog that lasted about 8 years and worked great. But...time takes it's toll on relatively inexpensive items, so I popped for the new version - expecting just as good results. I was wrong. Mine was well after any recalls - the thing EATS trimmer line. I don't have a large yard, but my single line trimmer could be loaded and would last me at least 3 mowings before needing to be reloaded. Twice now I have had to reload the spool 2 times in ONE DAY. As others have said - wear Army boots and heavy denim as the line will fling out and massacre your legs. I have had this piece of junk for 2 months and I am ready to throw it into the trash bin. Yeah..when it worked, it cut thru grass and weeds with ease. But at the rate it eats trimmer line, it would be cheaper in the course of one summer to buy a gas powered weedeater instead."
1,Avoid,"At first I couldent have been happier with this trimmer, it worked great and was very powerful. Then after one summer of use it stopped working. Dont buy this trimmer."
1,not worth it,"I have the updated version with the orange cap and for the first few months it worked great. But, about six to eight months into owning this trimmer a .98 cent piece of plastic in the spindle broke, costing me 11 bucks to get it shipped. And, to top it off something in the spindle has stripped so the spool has no power to cut grass, there's a loud whine that wasn't there before, and it simply is not worth the time and more money, and effort to get this unmitigated piece of junk fixed. A bad design all around, you can't even find an aftermarket spool to fit."
1,"Sorry B&D, this is junk.","I took the original with the malfunctioning spool back to HD and traded it in for the same model with the revised spool at no cost. Good for HD. Two years of light use later the belt shaft drive pulley melted. Stupidly the belt is only 1/2 the width of the pulley. So much product these days is just crap, including this trimmer. Zero stars."
3,"Great trimmer, terrible edger","I've used this trimmer with great results. It seems as powerful as a gas trimmer, probably more power than I needed. As a result I used it for edging along my sidewalk. Did a good job but stopped working after a few uses. Took it apart and found it used a rubber cogged belt drive. Under the heavy load of trimming, the cogs wore off leaving the drive covered by rubber dust. The driven pulley partially melted. The design could not handle the power of the motor."
4,my nemisis; weed whackers,"I used to own an electric ryobi weed whacker which accomodated a grass gator attachment, but the motor burned out-probably due to the plastic blades. I decided to purchase a gas model in order to have the blades again, but could only afford a low-end model which gave me pause, and then when I found out about the gas/oil mixture, I returned it. I went to consumer reports and took their recommendation for the Black Decker gh1000. I used it today and I can't complain about the power at all. It cuts right thru big weeds. The only thing I don't like is that the extension cord won't stay in the loop thing. Maybe it's just my weak woman hands. For the money, this tool is just fine and I won't be returning it, which for me, is a miracle."
1,Don't buy. Junk,"Wear eye protection, long pants and hang on tight. Lots of power but control is difficult. Bought it last September, have used it 7 or 8 times, now motor runs but trimer doesn't spin. This seems to be a common problem, a real piece of junk. I just used it for very light duty work, purchased to replace an old Sears trimmer that was about 25 years old. Now I am back to using that old Sears trimmer which is a little bulky and isn't as fancy looking but still does the job. Update, I took it apart, rubber drive belt was shredded and plastic gear on drive assembly was partially melted, cheap componets and poorly constructed. Watch for screw fastener hidden under decal, it makes dissassmbly a minor challange."
2,Reel burned up on tall grass,"I bought this yesterday and did only my small front lawn cutting a few areas of heavy weeds and the other taller grass that the mower would have a problem with. Toward the end of that time, I smelled something burning, and the reel started smoking. This was after it flew off 3 times and had to be re-wound. Even with careful rewinding, it seems to catch and get jammed in the automatic feeder. I exchanged it for a new one to see if I could at least get my back yard under control with it, but based on the previous review, it sounds like this will go back anyway."
2,grass hog trimmer,line feed never worked well. I bought it on the recommendations of consumer reports. It is powerful but I spent more time trying to load the line as it never auto fed as advertised. The casing holding the line cracker. it is difficult to edge properly with this tool.I returned it.joe
2,After one year,"Purchased last summer. After less than one year of moderate use, something snapped. Took it apart to find that rubber from th drive belt was cooked on the drive gear to the point that the belt rode over the edge of the drive pulley and came off. Price to fix myself is half the cost of a new one. Not first B & D item with problems in recent years. Will be looking for a different brand, no more B & D anything."
1,The worst piece of equipment from B&D,"The worst piece of equipment from B&D.; It uses too much line, line cuts and flies everywhere in big chunks. I used three spools for a small yard, which with the old B&D; used to use one spool every three or four yard work! I guess they are trying to sell their expensive spools!Now the motor works but the head stopped turning! It is only 3 months old and they want me to send it in at my expense. Sure, it cost more to send it. Guess where it goes now, yes the trash can. I will but another brand that works!"
1,Do not buy -- recall notice,"This product is powerful but has three serious flaws, one of which resulted in a recall The string trimmer hub can become detached and cause injury. The automatic string feed does not work well The drive belt breaks, and is hard to replace Save the $70 and spend it on a different make and model"
1,NOT WORTH IT!!!,"I thought I was doing a good thing by getting one with automatic spool and a stronger motor. I was wrong, this machine worked for a full 10 mins before it came apart. I went back and exchanged it two more times before I gave up. I should of read the reviews, before I bought one."
1,Disappointed,I regret purchasing the GH1000 Grass Hog. The dual cutting cord makes it difficult to neatly trim close to edging and sidewalks without scalping the lawn. I have not yet had to load new cord but I expect that to be much more difficult that with the single cutting line models.
1,Absolute piece of Junk,"This was unfortunately bought for me to replace my trusty older Grasshog (that worked like a charm), and after having to use it roughly three times. Just thought I'd reiterate whats already been said here.-Automatic Feeder. Doesn't work. Plain and simple. You'll spend more time re-spooling the line then actually trimming your yard.-Powerful, almost too powerful. Makes it hard to do any real edging with it, and it's damn near impossible to control at high speeds.-Like having cuts on your legs? Then this is the product for YOU!On the plus side, my motor hasn't died yet!Avoid like the plague."
3,not so durable,"I have had this trimmer and used it for two years. Today the motor burned up while trimming grass, not heavy weeds. Not too happy about getting only 2 years' work of not-so-heavy work from a tool supposedly powerful and durable."
1,Falls apart!,"First the trim guard broke and fell off, then it started spinning into the edger mode and won't stay in the trim position. Pretty crappy. I wasn't even done with the first spool of trim wire before it self destructed."
1,JUNK!,"Powerful and nice to see .080"" in an electric trimmer. That being said it is otherwise a total failure. String does not feed and is a nightmare to load. The edging guide is a flimsy worthless effort and at one point became a flying projectile when it got caught in the string. Luckily no one was walking by. I returned it and was told that they had gotten a large portion of these returned."
1,Spool Head Pops Off,I was very happy with my trimmer for the first several months. I used it a total of about 6 or 7 times. It worked great. Then the plastic spool head cover fatigued. Now I can't keep the spool on. The spool cover pops off and line goes flying everywhere. Then I have to chase down the cover - if I can find it.
1,Don't bother,"The trimmer works great until the plastic gear that drives the shaft melts which in my case was about the 20th time I used it. When the gear melts it shreds the drive belt. The belt is $3.00 and the gear is $53.00 from B&D, plus 10 dollars shipping. This apparently is a known problem with B&D trimmers based on the reviews at a number of different web sites. Anyway, spend your money on a different trimmer."
1,Design Flaw - Where's the recall B&D,"The only reason it got a star at all is because no star was not an option. The Grasshog is junk. Like most of us suckers mine broke about the fourth time I used it. Same old story. motor spins at higher RPM because it's no longer attached to the spindle. Mine rattles. I will not waste my time opening it up. From everything I've read, it's obvious. The gear melted, the belt shreaded and broke. I have talked to a person at a service center. He sees it in all of the GH1000's. It will cost more to fix than it did to purchase because you can't buy just the gear. No, you have to buy the whole motor. No more B&D for me. I'm spending a bit more for quality. I'm buying a WORX, Lithium. Shame on you B&D. You need a second recall and in not doing the right thing you will now lose many who use to believe in the name."
1,"They're right, it's junk","I've used my GH100 three times (2 hrs) and the drive gear has now melted. The hidden screw was a real pain in the neck. I wish I had read all of these other reviews before purchasing but.........it was a Christmas present. I won't be buying a new motor just to get the gear. Is the new gear metal or plastic? Maybe they will take it back since I have had it only since Christmas '09, alas, it has a 2007 date code. Is what they replace it with any better?Howard"
1,2 Breaks - Poor Quality,"The rotating head broke on the 2nd or 3rd use. After 4 months of usage the drive mechanism, between the electric motor and the head, failed because of stripped teeth. This is the worst trimmer I've had among the 4 I've purchased."
1,Major defect,"This is my second GH1000. Heres the problem: there is a toothed drive belt with metal pulley on the motor and a plastic pulley on the trimmer side. Run this very powerful trimmer for more than a few seconds at full power and the plastic pulley will melt, often times breaing the belt as well. B&D should rightfully recall and replace the plastic pulley with a better one. The feed mechanism works like this, when the strings get short it releases about 18"" of string on each side, which will cut through your pants, untill the blade on the cover cuts the string to the proper length. I have been cut more than once. Solution is to manually pull out the strings. Love the power but I am amazed this mess is still on the market."
2,Powerful but gobbles line,Got ours a little over a year ago. First the good: It's very powerful and rips through grass and weeds with ease. Ergonomically sound; great balance in the hands. The bad: This thing goes through line with astonishing speed. I can barely edge our yard before it goes through a cartridge. Ridiculous. Don't buy it unless you want to spend a fortune on line.
4,THEY WILL REPAIR FOR FREE! (please read),"You can now get your GH-1000 fixed for free! Just look up on the offical [...] site and find the service center nearest you. They will replace the melted plastic pulley with an aluminium one. I just verfied this with the service center nearest to me and I will be dropping off my THREE GH-1000 trimmers on Monday. They say it takes 1-2 weeks for the repair to be made. For now I keep my review 1 star because the fact that we all had to go through this is ridiculous, but I will say that when the product works I really did like it.UPDATE: Got the weed trimmer back after two weeks. They replaced the plastic gear with a METAL one - for free. Works like a charm now and I expect it to last. I have purchased two other trimmers (Stihl and Weedeater) and they are nowhere near as good as this Black and Decker trimmer! I am glad I was able to get it fixed for good."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!! PARTS NOT AVAILABLE,"i have had this trimmer for 6 mos. and the spool cover cap wore out. (which is quite normal on trimmers) Black and Decker kept telling me that the part ($1.25 retail on their website) was on back order for 2 weeks. Then 1 month, and now (this is 15th of July, 08) they will not be available until Jan. '09!!! Customer service told me nothing they could do, except i could order an entire replacement head, which with shipping & handling would cost almost as much as a new trimmer, which I am going to buy, but it will certainly not be a Black & Decker!"
2,Going to look elsewhere..........,"I have owned the Grass Hog XP since last year and I have one main complaint: when edging, there is not enough resistance in the line to cause it to feed. It just gets shorter and shorter unless you turn it over and engage the string with thick grass. The edging guide keeps it too far away from the ground for the line to come into contact. And when it does advance while edging, it throws the head around and diverts the cutting path, making it very difficult to cut straight. It is quite frustrating. My dad used it as well - somehow the button that allows the head to rotate from weeding to edging got stripped, it will not stay in the edging position solidly anymore. That could have been his fault: but the auto feed is not and leaves a lot to be desired."
1,Waste of time and money.,"I purchased one of these useless grasshogs thru Amazon in May of 07. Bottom line - the ""automatic"" feed system isn't - it doesn't function. I complained, and they sent me replacement parts. I installed them. No improvement. Save your money - and grief."
1,This is a junk tool,"I bought GH1000 and had to return it after first (!!!) use. GH600 seems to have the exact same two problems:1. The metalic shaft sways freely left and right. It's loose at the button that allows to change from horizontal to vertical orientation. Top of the shaft would sway just a little bit, but head (the far part with the string) would sway much more, in sudden jumps, making straight cut very hard to do, keeping me in great tension all along. I checked more B&D; GH trimmers at the store - all had swaying shafts. Beware.2. As many others have noted, the string melts in the casing and then feeds too fast, and then none at all"
4,"Nice trimmer, so far so good",I bought this trimmer after I noticed the $50 lower price on Amazon compared to my local brick & mortar store. So far it has served me well. I don't have a really big yard so it won't see extreme service with me. I just got a recall on it though through Amazon - hence 4 stars instead of 5. B & D is sending a kit to fix the recall issue.
1,d toruta,"This product should not be on the market. It has a major safety issue. I was just a few minutes into my first session when the HUB CAP and SPOOL went flying across the yard. Retrieved the parts, a quick inspection and reassembly, I was ready to give it another try. I think I set new state record for flying spools. After about six attempts, I pulled the plug...RIP. Please do not buy this product. It should be recalled... thanksBlack & Decker Grass Hog XP 14-Inch 7.2 Amp Electric String Trimmer/Edger #GH1000"
1,Poor quality and easily broken,I have had the same problems as the majority of other reviewers. The spool comes apart and flies off under normal use. This means that most of your time is spent rewinding the line back onto the spool. It used the entire plastic wire supply trimming about 300 sq. ft. of thin weeds. On its second outing the small plastic post controlling the wire feed broke. I was searching for replacement parts but after finding all of these negative reviews I will not bother. It will go in the trash and I will look for something better.
1,Where Have All the Corded Trimmers Gone?,"Whatever happened to the great corded-electric string trimmers of the past? I had two models---a Craftsman and a Ryobi---that were rugged, dependable and quite powerful---they lasted for years. Now they just put these toys and rechargeable ones on the market. Battery power is okay for small jobs, but would you ever get aboard a battery-powered airplane?This is the only corded one I could find...a total piece of junk.I guess I should have read the reviews carefully---I thought B & D might have fixed the spool issues.Seems powerful, but the line kept breaking off inside the spool housing. Once the housing comes off, trimmer line leaps out at you like a spring-loaded snake. After two tries with the same result...forget it.I managed to cut a 4 x 9' swath before giving up on this.Update: I found a Stihl corded trimmer that is a fabulous corded machine--- the FSE 60. Look for a Stihl dealer."
1,GH1000 is garbage,"This thing will break after a few times under normal use. My broke while in warranty, which means that they will send me a replacement so it will work a few more times before it breaks again.UPDATE: Well, I've used the replacement unit 3 or 4 times and it hasn't broken yet. However, it goes through about one full spool after every use. Therefore, still 1*.I am buying a new trimmer and throwing this one in the trash. I wouldn't wish this thing on my worst enemy."
1,HORRIBLE,"Do you want a really powerful trimmer that will flail your legs while spooling off all of the string in about 15 minutes? Do you want a really powerful trimmer that grabs the ground and cuts your grass right to the roots no matter how firmly you hold it? Do you want a trimmer that requires good hearing protection to prevent deafness? This, then, is the one for you. Apparently the designer has never heard of speed control because this unit has none; it just screams at full speed all the time that it is on. I didn't bother with the fix it because no fix it kit is going to fix all the things that are wrong with this trimmer. It's going into the garbage today and you can bet my next one won't be from B&D."
1,Do not Buy!!!,"The Auto Spool is Junk! After spending hours working on the spool line, I fixed it one last time and sold it at the yard sale. I had only used it for one season (2008). If the line spool does not work right then who cares about the power of the motor."
2,Was Briefly a Nice Trimmer,"I guess Consumer Reports is no substitute for actual long-term user reviews. At the time I shopped for mine, last year, it was the best in its class. And it did do a great job, right up until last week when the belt and plastic gear melted and fused together, which is apparently not a rare problem on this trimmer. I can't see buying the whole motor assembly just to have this happen again, so I guess it's time to throw it out and shop for a replacement. This time, the Amazon reviews will be consulted first.Real nice power, though, while it lasted, so I'll allow it two stars."
1,Do not buy this item,"My first Black and Decker trimmer burned out after about five uses. I liked the large swath it cut so bought another GH1000. It was used twice and is now in the trash. In both cases the fibre belt slips around the plastic drive gear, heats it up and the gear melts. Did not send in the warranty registration because they wanted many,many questions answered about everything from ""do I own a dog?"" to ""is this for weight control"" and written in microtype light grey ink on trash paper. In my opinion (as a retired engineer) this thing is a real piece of junk. Don't be a sucker."
1,Twice dissapointed,"The GH1000 appeared to be the best bargain in the search. A $170 trimer for $69 plus shipping. Upon receiving the product and the minor assembly required, it was plugged in and ready to go. For almost two minutes it worked perfectly...then nothing.The GH1000 was exchanged through Amazon.com and the second one arrived within a week. This one wouldn't even start. I checked the cord by plugging in another tool, and the second tool worked fine. So, the GH1000 was returned for a refund. But that's not the end of the review.Still needing a trimmer, I rechecked the retail stores and their web sites for prices. Four different stores had the same product, same price ($69) and no shipping. Guess which one I didn't purchase."
4,The B&D Hog is BEST!,I replaced my GH600 with this GH1000. It is much more powerful.I rated it 4-stars rather than 5 because the replacement spools are not available yet. I have used the GH1000 for 3 hours at a time & have not had any problems except for having to stop & re-string (no extra spools). I don't know why the other reviewers have had such problems.
4,Remember the good ol' days?,"Brent's songs remind me of what Buffett used to be before he ""knew what cash flow meant"". This CD is perfect beach music, catchy tunes and great lyrics. Feel good music, it makes you want to drink a cold one with your feet in the sand!"
3,Vivid storytelling of easy living.,"Brent's strength has always been the ability to paint a beautiful, restful picture with simple phrases and words. His voice has matured well with a friendly come sing with me attitude. The songs are taken from events in his life, but we feel they are also events in our life as well. My personal favorite is Neon Tan with its melody as soothing as any tropical mixed drink downed under a beach umbrella. George Eberlein's guitar work is properly soft spoken while adding very tasty surroundings to the lyric's main course."
4,Reminds me of Early Buffett,"This C.D. really grows on you with repeated listening. I found myself ""replaying"" the tunes in my head throughout the day. If you like Early Buffett ( Circa - High Cumberland Jubilee through Livin' & Dyin' In 3/4 Time period ) this C.D. should delight you. Like the Early Buffett the lyrics are clever and the rhymes are sometimes a bit of a stretch, but it is great fun. I really like "" If It's Snowbird Season Why Can't We Shoot ""Em "", ""Too Lazy To Work, Too Nervous To Steal "" and "" Aloha Betty"" I will purchase Brent Burns next C.D. when available."
2,let go of all your jealousy,"I found this album to be nothing more that a man trying too hard to be Jimmy Buffett. I also think that Mr. Burns should let go of his jealousy of Buffett's success. As far as te music goes, some of the songs were good, but others were pretty lame, only Jimmy Buffett himself can write those types of songs with consistent quality"
2,....disappointing,"Bought CD with anticipation, was highly disappointed by the obvious, unimaginative copy of Buffett's distinctive style."
2,Livin' The Life,"He may be Livin'The Life, but he doesn't copy the style. I expected a bit more, and was a little disappointed."
5,Worked better than expected,A real easy to use leather replacement wrap and I would recommend this. Nice and thick and self-adhesive worked well.
1,Worst paddle I'd tried - no control,"I tried this paddle to improve my intermediate level, and it was a total letdown. It has very odd and inaccurate control - the balls fly off the table no matter how I tried to control them. Smashing or not - the balls fly out for the most part.Decided to return it and try the Butterfly Seemiller. Haven't looked back - what an incredible difference. Seemiller is almost perfect, at least for me and I instantly noticed huge improvements in my game.I am truly surprised this Stiga worked for so many people. Perhaps it will work for you too but it didn't work for me."
4,Stiga Titanium Review,"Great Paddle.Great Spin and good control. Much more powerful than my previous one.Only con is that it is heavy paddle, but I knew that when I bought it."
5,Great racket,"This is a great racket. The rubber grips the ball like fly paper, and the speed is awesome!"
3,"Heavy, low spin, high muscle rackets","Because of lack of spin, this racket is not good creative service or returns. But it is good smashes and blocking smashes. This is not a racket if you want to develop your game."
3,ok,It was ok . For the price i expected more. Never played with a Titanium Paddle before. I guess i thought it was much better than the older paddles. like i said it was ok.
3,Not great but will do,"The mirror was received quickly and the box was pristine but when I opened the box, I found that a little of the mirror backing around the edges had flaked off. It was just a little and only in a few places. No one else will probably ever notice it but I notice it. I wish I had purchased something else but because the style, size and shape was what I needed, I kept it."
3,sort of odd....,"Great climbing, strange video, somewhat disorganized, but the climbing is interesting to watch."
4,Buy this.,"In episodes 10-12, Kenshiro finishes Madame Patra and her partner Dragon, then visits Bart's orphanage, which a gang called the Warriors, led by Jackal, plans to attack for its water source. There aren't any great fights in this one, except possibly the chase between Ken and Jackal, and the assassin in the forest. Still, fans of martial arts and anime itself should buy this. There are no problems with the dubbed version this time- it's pretty good in this one. Still, grab the subtitled one if you can."
3,Small,"It's a little on the small side. I got a 2T and the sleeves are short and so is the length of the sweatshirt. I thought the logo would be embroidered. If you buy, go up at least one side if not 2. For the price not so sure I would buy another."
4,Too Many Alternate Tunings,"Great collection, just like the 3-CD collection. As I practice songs in this collection, I keep wondering about all the alternate tunings. I'm sure that the Stones used alternate tunings on some of their songs, but this collection seems to use way too many. The resulting sound is accurate, but I sometimes wind up transposing the tab so that I can play it in the standard EADGBE tuning."
1,completly mis titled no tabs,The title is guitar tab editon there are no tabs in the book it is all chords I wasted [...] bucks on something that was titled tabs complete ripoff.
3,didn't pull me in,This is the second book I have read by Sinclair. The characters and plot just didn't pull me in. I didn't get any real depth to the story .
5,AA Must,This book contains the original manuscript from Bill W and DR Bob as they were writing the first version of the Big Book. Definity a great read.
5,I LOVE THIS BIG BOOK!,"I have been sober and studying the BB for 15 years I absolutely love this Big Book, The index is awesome the study note pages are great also."
4,A wonderful gift for someone in recovery,This is a very helpful tool for someone who is actively working the 12 step program. Your friend or loved one can highlight portions that are meaningful or that are problemmatic and discuss them with either a sponsor or another person also in recovery.
4,Good read on a seldom covered topic,"Chose the book for its title - wasn't clear if this was fiction or non fiction but at least it promised to look into slavery, a topic I have not until now read about and clearly been intrigued about.I had no expectations for this book, never heard of the author before but the trip across Atlantic in a ship - was a good catch, the trip almost devoid of emotion - the author being careful yet intriguing. He raises good questions that makes one wants to find out more about the subject. In to Liverpool and then Ghana - the intertwined stories of those caught up in the slave trade/ initial trade between West Africa and Ghana and Americans wanting to settle back in Africa offers some ironic insights into philosophy of who and when one is at home. Overall, good read and planning to read it again - would have loved abit more story about the Hebrew Israelites - the exodus section seems quite rushed and maybe that was the idea to leave the reader questioning the exodus???."
2,Not Enough Revenge,"I was not impressed with this video. It basically is a documentary on bull fighting. Although it does show the bull's getting the upper hand. I thought that it would be more graphic with humans getting bounced around like a hacky sack. The clips are very short with lots of bad camera angles. It was a good documentary, but it lacked what I would call real revenge. Every human in the video got up and walked away."
2,Getting what I wanted,"I thought I was ordering 4x6 olympus photopaper only to recieve 3x5 photopaper, now I must locate an adapter to use this paper"
5,One of the Greatest,It's a great shame that the Busch Quartet wasn't able to record the complete Beethoven String Quartets. These are fabulous performances -- graceful and exciting.The Busch Quartet was one of the premier string quartets of their day (roughly contemporaneous with the Budapest String Quartet). These transfers from 78s for Pearl are very good. The performances come through clearly with body and without the extranous electronic distortions...caused by poor use of digital noise reduction technologies.Highly recommended!!
4,A Must-Have for Wills & Trusts Students,"I usually don't use hornbooks, but I was stumped with all the Wills and Trusts material. I initially got the Examples & Explanations book, which was a HORRIBLE MISTAKE. It lacks even the most basic concepts. I then went for Emanuel's, which was keyed to our textbook, and it was a dream come true, especially the mini briefs."
2,Helpful But Full of Mistakes,I really want to love this book. Currently I am 32 pages in reading the intestacy material. The book has mistakes in it. I brought it to my professor after noticing inconsistencies between this book and the Dukeminier casebook it is keyed to. On page 22 when dealing with UPC intestacy approach the Emanuels has incorrect information. This was confirmed by my professor. I wouldn't mind but I keep coming upon errors in editing and information. I will say though that I like the book and the way it is organized very much.
3,Rancid taste,"When I put these in my mouth, there's an immediate rancid taste on my tongue that I hate, so make sure you have your water ready to drink right away. As for sleep, they do help me sleep well through the night, but I'm going back to the capsule form when I finish my current bottle because the capsules do not have the disgusting taste."
3,Not a cure all for sleep disorders,"L-Triptophan is excellent for helping sleep onset, but staying asleep can still be a problem. Good sleep habits best for a full night's rest."
2,mas de lo mismo!!,"El primer libro fue una excelente novela, el segundo estuvo aceptable, pero el tenia que seguir escribiendo. Asi, mas de la mitad de este libro se basa en lo que ""el"" hizo para conseguir los manuscritos, y no en las aventuras del ""piloto"" de la USAF. Como novela, bastante aburrida. Y es solamente eso, una novela, no una ""revelacion"" como dicen algunos. En la serie pinta una muy bonita imagen de JC y Dios, la cual me gusta mucho, pero no deja de ser parte de la gran imaginacion de Benitez. Del 2 para adelante no valen la pena."
4,Hankering For the Past,"Maybe it's not everybody's choice of music. It dates back a bit, but it's easy listening with great instrumentals - guitar, sax, etc, and Al Stewart's typical vocals. If you enjoyed 'The Year of the Cat' and 'Time Passages' then here's some more.I've just discovered a trove of music I had no inkling of, from the artist I've always enjoyed the most, all there at good prices at Amazon.com.Thanks Guys,Stallan"
3,1/2 of a GREAT album....,"FIVE STARS 4 the 2nd side -- ""Roads to Moscow,"" ""Terminal Eyes"" & ""Nostradamus"" -- but the 1st side is a TOTAL BORE!The 2nd side is Al at his absolute BEST -- words can't Xpress the feeling of loss & loneliness at the Nd of ""Roads to Moscow."" ""Terminal Eyes"" is a lot of fun -- like hearing ""I Am the Walrus"" in some alternate universe. & ""Nostradamus"" is simply brilliant -- cosmic, great lyrics, gorgeous fiery instrumentation .. but the opera singer who comes in at the very Nd may grate on yr nerves....But I can't get thru the 1st side without falling asleep -- there's just nothing memorable there, & I own most of Al's albums. Buy this 4 the 2nd side...."
4,Great second half,"WHEN THIS WAS AN LP, NO ONE PLAYED THE FIRST SIDE.Released in 1974, this is Al Stewart's fifth album, depending on how you are counting. It is 42 minutes long and the transition to CD is very good.This album had two killer tracks, the 8 minute Roads To Moscow and the 9 minute Nostradamus. In between those 2 songs was the very good 3 minute Terminal Eyes, which reminds of the Beatles Come Together or I Am the Walrus, but not quite as wierd.The first side of the album consisted of some boring, tedious songs. It seems like Al Stewart is at his worst when he sings about the Navy (just like Lord Granville on the Year of the Cat).This was one of those LP's where you played only one side. You listened to the other once, and would never play it again. There were many like that in rock history, like Iron Butterfly's In-A-Godda-Da-Vida or Rare Earth's Get Ready."
3,CoffeeShop/ Historical Banter,"Somewhere in Al Stewarts mind surely exists a feverish wonder about WHAT WILL HAPPEN NEXT? His belief in sooth, and his odd concern about people and places he's nevered, seems to mock his much better than average coffee house strum. A good romance deal for them superstitious types."
2,"Okay, but....","I like the look of this pendant and the carving is very nice and it's not to big or small, but the hole that the chain or cord has to go through is very tiny. I could not even fit a small size chain throught it, I had to buy a special bail and clip it on and then thread a chain through the bail. Just a little too much trouble for my taste."
4,A Little Off,"great cd! but i think you should have put in a couple more old skool eminem songs that noone has ever heard of, like infinite and 313 etc, just a suggestion, maybe another cd?well i recommend it...peace"
4,long clipboards,These clipboards were tough for me to find here on Amazon.The extra length is great when you want to prop the clipboard up in your lap or against something.The finish is lacking and a bit rough to the touch. Just a bit. I recall one I had years ago being much more smooth.
3,"Interesting story, but lacks detail","You don't often see mass murderers in their 70's! That alone makes this an interesting and entertaining book. However, I was disappointed at the lack of detail in this book. I never felt I got to 'know' any of the characters, least of all the main character, Ray Copeland himself. If the author had put more time into researching the background of the Copelands and their victims, this would be a far better read."
1,Terrible....even for the true crime genre,"Ok, I will admit. I am one of ""those people"" who likes to read true crime stories on occasion. It is one of those guilty pleasures that I try to excuse through the pursuit of understanding regarding why people can be so evil. There are quite a few very good books on the subject like ""In Cold Blood"" and ""Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil"" (although some may not consider this true crime). However, ""The Copeland Killings"" is awful. The book is not well written grammatically, is fairly slow paced for such a short true crime book and is not even a good journalism story. Basically, Ray Copeland was a bad guy all along, so you never really get to the question, ""What went wrong""? I bought this book for 50 cents at a garage sale to take hiking, and I recommend paying no more than I did for this read."
1,Not very exciting,"I usually enjoy true crime, but this one wasn't very good. Also, I thought it was totally uncalled for to waste tax payers money on a trial for Ray Copeland, when he wanted to plead guilty. Come on! The old geezer was in his 70s...life in prison would have made more sense. Of course, as these things usually are, there was political motivation involved."
4,Big band arrangements for the 21st century,Bought this album after attending a show by Joo Kraus in Germany. Music in line with dutch modern big band 'New Cool Collective' just a little more laid back. Nice combination of lounge jazz and big band.
1,Needle rest position is 9 inches Hg vacuum,"The gauge's needle rest position is 9 inches Hg vacuum. Useless. Returned to Amazon for replacement. On a positive note: Gauge is 3 1/2 inches in diameter — not the 2 1/2 "" given in the product's description."
4,Handy tool,I bought one of these back in 1997 for tuning my carburetted engines. I don't know how I got along without it!
1,decitefull,Its not what was addvertized its just a vacume gauge not compression it only have the hose for vacume and none for compression until now I haven't used it because I can't find a set of compression hose and fittings so iam disapointed verry much won't recomend to any one.
4,An interesting look from the outside,"As a scientist (working on PCR technologies), the book was quite enjoyable, in particular the introduction in which the author has very interesting insights on the psychology of people working on scientific research, and made me pause for a ""look at the mirror"". The remaining of the book is a more casual reading, which nonetheless I found very interesting."
5,The best crashes of all time,"This film documents some of the best crashes in mountain biking that I have ever seen. You want to see the carnage, then get it. It also has interviews about the infamous Bullet race by many famous riders. Its a great thrill ride, get on."
1,the Reduction in Force Testament,"The book is outdated having been published in 1989. The authors do not offer any original or unique ideas. In my opinion, the book was misrepresented, which would account for the fact that there are no samples of the content or any information offered other than the title. I purchased the book because I inferred from the title that the book might be a useful source of information for some research that I am conducting. Unfortunately, the book is simplistic and does not cite a single outside reference. The book is a soft cover booklet of less than 100 pages, a book of this caliber would typically retail for $10-$12, a booklet of this age is worth perhaps $5. The seller charged me approximately $100. I would not purchase a book from this seller again.Ron Davidson, Ph.D., MBA"
1,bratz activity and coloring book,Never received this item. Received the rest of my order for Christmas presents but did not receive this
5,Edirol Carrying Case for the R-09,"This bag is well worth the investment. It holds the R-09HR, cables, adapters, extra memory cards...heck..I can even shove a mic and 10' cable in there. I was really surprised at how well organized this bag was insofar as dedicated spots for the things I mentioned that can be stored (even the mic and cable)Edirol R-09HR High-Resolution WAVE/MP3 Recorder"
2,Boring and predictable,"Cozy mysteries are usually not my favorite reading. Of course, there are exceptions. Rhys Bowen or Simon Brett come to mind. This book is, unfortunately, without a spark of originality or wit. The puzzle is lame and predictable, and the characters are extremily boring. Somehow, I saddled myself with one more book from this series. I just cant imagine that I will ever read it."
1,"Mediocre Writing, Silly Plot","I was extremely disappointed in, and just flat-out bored by, this book. Overblown purple prose serves no purpose, and the storyline takes forever to move (and even then feels contrived). I finally just put the book down and refused to continue. Just insulting, pointless reading. If this is what is passing for ""good writing"" nowadays in Creative Writing classes (the jacket says she teaches CW at some community college) then this woman needs to be fired and replaced, quickly, because she's obviously ruining young, talented minds with this drivel."
2,An intriguing but disappointing novel,"While this novel and its characters were intriguing to me, it was unsatisfying. Steinke piles dysfunction on top of dysfunction and trauma on top of trauma to somehow explain Ella's behavior. I never felt like I understood Ella or her gallery of insane relatives. Steinke's prose is very beautiful and evocative but her plot and character development left me wanting a whole lot more."
4,The Fire in the Writing,"Here's a story where every word counts, where metaphor is as vivid as the flame of a match, and the story line as searing as a destructive fire. The main character is well-sketched in slight but effective description. The theme of ""fires"" is well-thread throughout the story. In some of the minor characters there is less development, but it plays out fine. This is a haunting story of a girl who sometimes feels as thin as smoke and sometimes as large as a raging inferno."
4,Excellent Book!!,"I was looking in the book store for books on sale, and I noticed this book on the rack. It is exactly the type of book I like to read. This exciting story of Ella, and how she has an obsession with fire, is a great story to read. I thoroughly enjoyed the book, with all its twists and turns!! I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who is interested in it."
4,"The book, a great find. The author, magnificent!","Rene? Are you out there? I just read ""The Fires"" and I have to say that you are a very gifted lady and i would be thrilled to be a student of your prose and creative writing class. Could I stay after school to involve myself deeper into your genius and masterful technique of metaphor useage? Ella is the epitiomy of many a youth feeling the pangs of loneliness, insecurities and family breakup.This book needs national exposure, support from health institutions and publicity! Rene, contact me, I want to congratulate you personally!"
3,NOT an Introductory Text ! Alif Baa FIRST!!!,"This book is the required text of my beginning Arabic course at a university. I am a little (okay, a lot) nervous about having to use this book for class. Although the front cover says 'A Textbook for Beginning Arabic', this book assumes that the student has already completed the text Alif Baa (Introduction to Arabic Letters and Sounds) by the same author (Brustad). This is clearly stated on the back of the book which says that this book 'follows naturally on the introductory text, Alif Baa'. It looks like a great text for someone who has already mastered reading and writing Arabic and is somewhat familiar with basic vocabulary. I don't think this book should be used for an introduction to Arabic course - but if your instructor makes it a required text like mine did, I HIGHLY reccomend Alif Baa and/or The Arabic Alphabet How To Read & Write it by Nicholas Awde & Putros Samano."
2,"""Guess the meaning of the following word from context.""","Will not continue in a class that uses this text. The glossary is seriously incomplete. The text will use Arabic words that were used (but not necessarily emphasized)in Alif Baa and previous chapters and not translate them. Not all of them are in (the blue) A-E dictionary. Lots of wasted time looking up words instead of using or memorizing them.It asks the student to play guessing games -- what if you guess wrong!! Now you have to un-learn something.The DVDs are ok, but, as with those of the pre-cursor text, none of the students in my class could hear the words clearly so that we could spell them. Most of us were starting from zero Arabic.Not the text for those with a full time job and other committments."
2,Al-Kitab is adequate at best.,"I'm about to graduate college and have studied arabic for 3 years (after this semester). 2 of those years I have used Al-Kitab. All in all, its not the greatest book. The vocabulary is rather obsolete; in the first chapter you learn how to say United Nations (because that comes up in conversation regularly in the Arab world RIIIGHHHHTT???). The way the book explains grammar is confusing to native english speakers and the DVD will break on you...so plan on getting a back up. If you plan on getting al-kitab for independent study...GOOD LUCK!!! I only succeeded because I was under the care of a professor, al-kitab had little to do with my success. For independent study, i'd try rosetta stone, its a bit more expensive, but its easier to grasp than the lessons in Al-kitab. Good luck, arabic is a very difficult language to learn."
4,Don't try this on your own,"While I would say that you shouldn't try this on your own, in the context of the classroom, it's a very useful resource. It does not stand on its own in terms of learning material for everyday conversational use but it does not pretend to do so.For those who would knock it, read the introduction. It is not shy about relating the amount of effort that must be put in to get an adequate result."
1,angry,I have not yet received this book and I am leaving within TWO WEEKS. My school has instructed me to purchase these books before leaving.
4,Very Satisfied,This is the first used item I've ever ordered so I wasn't sure what to expect. But I was pleasantly surprised when it arrived exactly as described.
1,The worst language textbook I've ever used,"Having studied German, Mandarin and Latin, I have to say the Al-Kitaab fii Ta'allum al-'Arabiyya is categorically the worst language textbook I've ever encountered. Stay away."
3,Could be better organized,This is a difficult textbook to use because it is so disjointed. I think they did it that way for a reason... so that you would force yourself to dig for the answers and use clues to put the language together in your mind. This approach is not for everyone IMO.
2,More or Less Worthless,"I agree with some of the previous reviewers that the book is pretty much worthless. The assumption seems to be that you will learn the new words on your own from a dictionary (a real dictionary, that is, not the one included in the book), and you will learn grammar from a grammar primer, and then you will also have paid 50+ bucks for this book - if only to justify the expenditure of whatever grant supported its compilation."
4,Good Start . .,"Al-Kitaab is an interesting and fairly comprehensive beginners guide to Arabic that uses the story of two main characters to introduce new vocabulary and grammar. The book could be more explicit with new grammer, but is otherwise engaging, clear and moves at a good pace."
2,Introduction to Arabic,"This book is very rudimentary, but a good starter for learning the Arabic alphabet and some very basic vocabulary. I wish it was extended instead of making the student buy a second textbook to get more in depth."
5,This will keep you busy,"Definitely not for the absolute beginner. If you are an absolute beginner, you need to get the Alif Baa book, AND study other sources as well, otherwise you will be lost and struggle.It is a good quality book and DVD. However, you will go slowly, even after having gone through the Alif Baa book. It would be helpful if there were some kind of ""in-between"" book.It has grammar, which Rosetta stone doesn't provide."
4,Great book- with a teacher,"I am in my 2nd semester of college Arabic and we are currently using this book. With the teacher, this book is great. Arabic is not learned lke other languages, for example-numbers, colors, etc. Rather, it allows the student to start dialogue within the first week of class. This book introduces new vocabulary in each chapter and goes over sentence sturture and grammer using these words. The words for vocabulary are directly in relation to Maha's and Khalid's story, that's why you will learn how to say ""my mother works as a secretary"" before ""How many students are in the class"". The new book does have dvd's with a new untypical Egyptian Maha and Khalid. As you get further into the book, you can begin to teach yourself because the grammar is written out more clearly."
4,How does a student rate a textbook anyway?,"First off, Amazon was the cheap and the standard shipping was prompt.The item itself ""Al-Kitaab"" (which literally translates to ""The Book""); is supposed to be the premier source for learning Modern Standard Arabic in a classroom setting. The text is impossible to understand if you had not fully completed its prelude ""Alif-Baa"", Al-Kitaab jumps right into sentence structure, grammar and a segment of a story that a learner follows as they progress through the book, not to mention the 3 DVD's that are included are almost entirely in Arabic. I would recommend getting the answer key for al-kitaab even if you are a student, it can do a great deal of help if used correctly.You will be speaking arabic in no time! en'shalla"
1,Really?,"Honestly, this is one of the worst put together books I have seen in my life. They even have an introductory book for the alphabet. Also awful.They introduce words and concepts that we have no knowledge of. The organization is terrible. I feel like I should be able to start with colors and numbers and the alphabet. Instead, I'm being thrust into the world of sentences with UNITED NATIONS as the subject!Are YOU KIDDING ME?Who ever the hell thought this was a good idea for teaching in a college class is nuts. Sure, on my own time, learning this book might be possible. It's just inconceivable to think that this is actually supposed to help when all I do is get more and more confused."
1,There are no outstanding Arabic instruction books!,"Why is this? Why are Arabic instruction books sooooo atrocious? There is sufficient demand for Arabic now and sufficient research in language education to come up with something better. What a sad testament that Al Kitaab is actually the standard in university-level Arabic instruction! It makes me want to rip my hair out. Somebody, anybody, PLEASE publish a decent Arabic instruction text. And, for all you publishers out there doing colloquial Arabic: EGYPTIAN!! A third of all Arabs are Egyptian and it's the only dialect universally understood by other Arabs. So please quit with all the Lebanese, Saudi, Iraqi, Jordnaian colluquial courses until there is a decent Egyptian course available."
2,not quiete good,"A DVD was missing, pages ripped, and all the exercices filled up with a pen... not very good quality but because of the law price, acceptable"
4,Learning Arabic,"This is a great resource for learning Arabic, although even with the first lesson the introduction of little used words is pointless and annoying especially for a beginner. There is enough to think about and process without having to figure out words that you just don't really use in everyday conversation. But otherwise the format is good i.e. listening to a narrative that incorporates the vocabulary, and the exercises following are helpful."
3,okay book,"The book arrived very quick! The company is very responsible. The website said ""like new"" but the first chapter has many written in it. I expected no writing in the book. The book condition is very good beside the writing."
1,Not good,"I brought used product before but its condition is very bad. Second, on title it was written with DVD but DVD was missing. I was disappointed after receiving the parcel."
5,Great book for my son to learn how to fix his truck,He is always saying pop this dont work or that dont work and now he can look up the problem and most of the time fix it himself.
3,COOKIES,"THE COOKIES ARRIVED VERY QUICKLY. SOME OF THE COOKIES WERE BROKEN, BUT THEY WERE IN GOOD SHAPE. I AM ENJOYING THEM VERY MUCH."
3,Names of those murdered,The concept of why this happened was very interesting. The fact that the author did so little research about the names and spelling of their names of those poor souls who died is shameful.
2,Predictable and poorly executed,"Motel owner Ben falls for Sierra, a new gal in town who is starting up a landscaping business. He romances her while he tries to rescue her from her abusive ex-husband. A reluctant born again virgin (aren't all her heroines either virgins or women with a single bad sex partner who ruins it for her?), Sierra doesn't want anything to do with a relationship since her last one was so nasty, but Ben pursues her relentlessly. In this follow up to ""Too Much Temptation,"" author Foster proves that plot and character development need not be present when you inundate your story with plentiful acrobatic sex and cardboard characters. The more endearing and heartwarming story was the secondary plot between Sierra's partner and Ben's mom.Foster has written much better. Check out ""Unexpected"" for a successful blend of plot, character development, and genuine storytelling."
4,"Great follow-up to ""Too Much Temptation""","I read ""Too Much Temptation"" about Noah Harper, Ben Badwins half bother and loved it. Once I read that I had to read ""Never Too Much"" about Ben and his romantic endeavors. Just like Too Much Temptation there were definetly side plots and stories unfolding with a wonderful ending for all.Love this book. If you loved Too Much Temptation you will love Never Too Much. Of course lots of romance, truth, and sex."
5,Very Good,"Ben's story is a good as Noah's. Ben becomes attracted to his new neighbor who owns a landscaping business. Sierra is afraid of a relationship, because of the abuse she suffered from her husband and father. She just wants to be independent and make her business successful. Ben doesn't want to take any of this away from her he just wants to be close to her. He slowly works his way into her heart. He shows her that not all men are the unfeeling and brutal as her husband and father. This is a well written romance that will leaving wishing that there was more."
2,So-so,"I have to agree with the reviewer who wrote that Lori Foster's characters are basically one dimensional, but avid readers read Foster's books for the sex. I'd like to add that with Foster it's usually hit or miss. I loved ""Too Much Temptation,"" but this one, like some of her other books, was a bit ridiculous and boring. With TMT, I liked the characters of Noah and Grace (even though Grace was annoying at times) and felt the chemistry between them. With NTM, I never really felt anything for them. Their relationship was too sophomoric.Moreover, this book is billed as ""An erotic love story."" Erotic?!? Oh, please. NTM wasn't even close to TMT in this area. All around, I'd say this book was just uninteresting and boring."
2,Disappointing,"I am a big fan of Lori Foster and after reading ""Too Much Temptation"" I was really looking forward to reading Ben's story. Unfortunately, the book failed to meet the standard set by its predecessor. The story was slow to develop and for the first time ever, I found myself bored with a Lori Foster book and wishing it to come to a quick end."
2,"Another author who thinks they can write erotic romance, NOT","While a romance exists between Ben and Sierra, they go around and around about building up to some highly overrated moment. Pages and pages of story line that falls flat in the erotic department. Ben spends a whole lot of time chasing after Sierra like a whipped puppy and she's cold to him at every turn. While I like Ben, I don't see what he finds attractive about this woman. Save yourself some disappointment and money. Get three of the same type of romance story from any author for what this one so-called erotic romance cost. Thumbs down."
4,Not as good as TOO MUCH TEMPTATION.,"I gave it 4 stars but can't honestly say I LOVED IT. Still, it deserved more than 3 stars. I liked Ben. Hated Sierra; got real tired of her real soon. I thought the best part was the attraction and growing romance between Kent (Sierra's friend) and Brooke (Ben's mother); as well as Ben's reaction to the chemistry between the two of them. I'd rather have read more about Kent and Brooke; you can credit the 4th star to them. And, please, that ex-husband. Could he be any more of a stereotype? Geez, Lori, come on, you can do better than this. This whole book reminded me of teenage romances I read as a kid."
2,Yawn..,"Despite the books beauty and wonderful artwork, the writing is horrible and extremely boring. It even manages to screw up the legend of King Arthur."
4,HAPPY TO PICK UP THE PIECES,"I had been waiting years to find music by AWB and was'nt able to find any until I accessed AMAZON.COM. I thank god that I did, because this is one of the baddest bands that I've had the pleasure to listen to."
2,Nothing else Like Picking Up the Pieces,"I don't want to say if this is a good, or bad CD. I will just say that if you're looking for more song that sounds like Picking Up the Pieces...there are NONE. I would recomend downloading the song for 99 cents somewhere."
5,Would be perfect if....,"The only thing wrong with this album is that it is missing ""Twilight Zone"" form the first album and ""Nothing you can Do"" fromAWB(the second album). Otherwise, this album is flawless, frankly the best make out music of all time, as well as some of the best dance tracks ever laid down. These pioneers of British ""Northern Soul"" have created many as evidenced here, timeless tracks that are just as good, just as danceable as they were 30 years ago. How many of the songs you liked back in the day would still sound fresh today as the great AWB?"
3,picking up the pieces,"This is a good greatest hits cd,the AWB was one of the best groups of the disco era but for some reason they cut the hell out of the queen of my soul song on this cd,that was one of their best songs,because of this I am sending my copy back,as far as the rest of the cd it's great but the best song is cut,that's it, have a great day."
2,Pickin' Up the Pieces,The CD is really not what I expected. I may be a little too old to enjoy the style rock they play.
5,Great Music,"The A.W.B. ""Pickin up the Pieces"" C.D. is well worth the price there horn section is outstanding. Theires a live version of ""Cloudy"" that shows the talent of this band."
4,speechless review,"in conversation with someone I knew (of) in the 70's, AWB came up as being ""it"". He was speechless upon receiving it as gift."
4,Average and still slammin,"These guys really had their own unique style, one that will still get your feet tapping. Or the mellow..Love of Your Own.....take a listen and decide for yourself."
5,If We Had Wings,This book is one of the most beautifully put together books I have seen in a long time..Truly a keeper. Pinky Feakes
4,short,ordered for daughter...she loves it. Be aware that it is short waisted and likely won't fully cover middrift if plannning to wear to school or anywhere with a dress code
4,Another Cool Sweet Valley High book,"Dee Dee Chase comes from a troubled family..her father walked out on the fam,and D.D believes this is because her mum was too independent!!So,terrified of losing her boyfriend Bill,she clings to him like a tight sweater,and it's choking him.HE is already to call it quits till Elizabeth has a plan..as usual."
3,lsu,We gave this plate for Christmas and it tarnished so quickly I was amazed. May be we got one that wasn't oversprayed protecting the shine. Not Pleased!
4,HEINLEIN READERS WILL LOVE THIS,"I really enjoyed the book, as I enjoy Heinlein books as an adult, but it is obviously geared toward the juvenile audience. Great. However, it is not finished and we are left hanging in space (pun intended) with the story unresolved. Heinlein didn't do that. I hope Mr. Sheffield continues the story line, but he has so many irons in the fire------. Well, we'll see."
5,"A delightful, fun, must-read for inquisitive minds.","Dr. Glashow presents in a logical progression the seminal ideas of twentieth century physics. He spices up this tantalizing but often dry material with a saucy seasoning of his personal life history, showing that Einstein was not the only scientist who did his best thinking in cafes and sailboats. The resulting story details the life of a modern crusader, less decadent than Petronius's Satyricon, less fanciful than Voltaire's Candide, but a heck of a lot more fun than learning these ideas by getting your own PhD in physics at Harvard."
2,No Tape. No Flashcards. Need the tape for pronunciation.,"I tried one of the ""associate"" vendors to purchase this book. My rational being that maybe, a vendor other than Amazon, would send the tape and flashcards. No such luck. I wrote a complaint to Prentice Hall. The cost is WAY too high for what you get. I have the book ""Spanish Phrases for Landscaping Professionals"". I highly recommend it. Has Phonetic phrasing...big help"
4,A basic workbook with lots of pictures and emphasis on conversation,"This is an entertaining workbook with lots of pictures, matching exericises, crossword puzzles, multiple choice quizes, and worksheets. The vocabularly is very useful for gardening work. Each chapter has a very good description of some cultural differences between Anglos and Hispanics they might employ as gardeners. It seems like a lot of money to pay for a workbook, but then the subject is quite specialized, and the book is fun to work through. It would be great to have the flashcards advertized with the book, but another reviewer says that neither they nor the advertized audio tapes come with it."
3,NO Flash Cards or Audio Tape!,"I just received this book, have not gotten into it yet, but noticed that the Flashcards and Audio Cassette Tape mentioned in the description, are NOT INCLUDED in the shipment.Once I get over my resentment I expect I will get a lot out of the workbook, the layout is clear and there are useful topics I did not expect."
3,Greel tragedy?,"""Athena"" is probably one of the dullest musicals ever produced. The story of two sisters from a family of health nuts slowly plods along from pitfall to pitfall as each sister(they are 2 of 7 but fortunately the musical focuses on only them since they are played by Jane Powell and Debbie Reynolds)tries to land the man the stars has predicted is the right man for them. The plot is predictable, the songs are nice but there is never that spark that brings the film to a higher level. It's a very watchable film nonetheless and then DVD transfer is OK-no one is going to spend alot of time re-mastering this film to prefection. If you enjoy musicals, you will certainly want to see this, mostly as a relic from a bygone era. And yes, pre Hercules Steve Reeves has a small supporting role."
4,Athena,"I love musicals of any description, the singing & songs were wonderful. Sometimes I found some of the acting didn't seem up to scratch, I love anything with Debbie Reynolds & Jane Powell in it anyway. The storyline is simple but carefree & the clothes were gorgeous. Loved it all the way."
4,The Path Less Traveled...,"Wow, this film is a departure from most MGM musicals I have seen. Not to say it's bad but clearly different. Even the dialog is different. This movie strikes out on its own and for the most part wins. Jane Powell (by the way I have a color negative of Jane Powell at Disneyland in 1959 where she looks like the most beautiful woman in the world!), Debbie Reynolds and the rest the girls are as cute as cupcakes as they make you smile with their sweet ways. Just like the film State Fair a most pleasant fun film to watch on a rainy Sunday morning..."
4,A Lite Delight,"What's not to like about this frothy musical confection. A young Debbie Reynolds, Jane Powell at the peak of her powers and charm, and Steve Reeves. The rest of the cast includes Vic Damone, Louis Calhern and Edmund Purdom along with the rest of the fine ensemble. Of course it's predictable, of course it's silly, of course you'll want to watch it over and over again."
4,"Steve Reeve: in an early movie, but well done.","If you are a Steve Reeves fan you will enjoy seeing him in a small part that he does well. The movie is interesting for the time period, in one sceen the leading man lights a cigarette and a member of the health conscious community of which Steve Reeves belongs removes it saying ""don't commit suicide"". That is fairly remarkable considering the movie was made in 1954, before cigarette warning labels. It is a light and humorous love story that most will enjoy. Edmund Purdom, Debbie Reynolds, and Vic Damone are also excellent. The only parts of the movie I didn't like were the songs."
5,How to use proven techniques to enhance suspense,"In Fiction First Aid: Instant Remedies For Novels & Stories, published author, poet, and screenwriter Raymond Obstfeld utilizes helpful examples drawn from classic and contemporary literature and film to show aspiring writers how to examine a flawed manuscript, diagnose the problems, and then correct them. A very highly recommended addition to any ""how to"" writing reading list or reference collection, Fiction First Aid shows how to use proven techniques to enhance suspense and meet reader expectations; make individual character motivations consistent with their action and the framework of the plot; determine the best place in which to set a story or particular scene; give minor and peripheral characters of their own; distinguish a genre or mainstream novel through using a unique style and a creative plot."
4,Almost perfect MP3 recorder.,"What separates a good product from a great product? Testing and completeness of function. The TrekStor i.Beat Organix FM is a good but not a great product. I replaced an iRiver MP3 recorder. This unit only allows 80, 96 and 128 kbps bit rates resulting in large files for voice recording and only Stereo files for line in. One can not pause a recording once started. And be VERY careful to select the correct firmware from the web site if upgrading. I lost my FM capability by loading the wrong firmware. TrekStor provided instructions on how to correct the problem, but I'm scared to try. Be very sure your USB hub is powered when connecting or you will believe the unit is broken. No mention in the poorly written manual about that. Even as a player, I've used better units for less money. For $70 it is the lowest cost recorder that uses native MP3 format, but the many quirks makes it a disappointment."
2,below par,"I got this knife in a large set and was not pleased with the chef knife at all. Although it was sturdy and well balanced, the weight was a little heavy for my liking, but it did not cut true at all. Every cut curved in a degree, and it was not a problem with technique! I haven't had any problems with all the other knives in the set, they are all well made last a long time before needing to be honed"
2,"Let Baba Yaga be evil, please!","I am seriously conflicted about this book. No doubt it is well written and excellently illustrated. My problem is with the basic story and the ""revisionism"" of Baba Yaga's place in the world which seems indicative of a general trend to root all evil out of children's literature. In my opinion evil and fear are important elements in fairy tales and they prepare children to deal with the real world. Classic (pre-Grimm) fairy tales were incredibly graphic and scary (see Marina Warner's ""From the Beast to the Blonde""). Baba Yaga has a definite and clear place in Slavic fairy tales--she is the main ""evildoer"" who eats children, etc. Let her be that!"
3,I love Baba Yaga tales,"A politically correct updated version of Baba Yaga.In this case, she just wants to be a grandmother, but the villagers are afraid of her. She decides to disguise herself.Ultimately, a tale of acceptance."
3,a little tough to use,"Maybe a little unfair, but the guide is a bit tough to use. The culprit might have been the bit I used it with; that bit was a 3/4"" with a thick shaft. As a result it was tough to get a tight bend in the shaft while trying to get up into the ceiling."
3,Okay...,"The cable still works after a few months of use, but it is very flimsy and therefore makes it very hard to wrap when not in use. But, that's what you get a for a cheap cable."
3,Works fine though an issue or two.,"This is an inexpensive soldering iron. I used it today and it worked fine. It only has a two pronged plug, which might be an issue for someone working with sensitive electronics. Also the color of the iron i recived is orange, not blue as the photo shows. The handle gets very hot, which is why i can only give this three stars."
2,WARNING,"I ordered these from ""tao of herbs"" through amazon, but they sent me another brand (""Nature's Answer""), which is in non-vegetarian gelatin sofgels. Naturally as a longtime vegetarian, I am not at all happy and will have to attempt to source these locally."
5,Gorgeous. The picture really does these no justice.,"The bees are incredibly detailed--you can see their little eyeballs! Shipped insanely quickly, and they're even in a pretty bag for the gift-wrap challenged. Every vein in the wings is meticulously made! The stones attract light in a way the picture can't convey. They are extremely delicate-looking, but pleasingly solid in your hand. Far beyond my hopes and probably going to wow the recipient. I'll be re-visiting this seller for more shiny things. Buy them! She'll love them!"
2,does not work for me,this time its does not work for me.i dont know why.last year was good for my sinus.sorry .and this capsules to expensive
3,new settlement cookbook,"not the same book i was hoping to order, but a very similar one, just the same. good packaging and fast shipment."
1,Cookie Cutter story,The story read like a college paper outline -- such a cookie cutter approach! The first half of the book you meet and learn all the suspects -- then the crime -- then the investigation of the suspects -- and finally a twist at the end when we learn who really committed the crime. The author tried too hard in the second half to make us think that each suspect was the murderer. I was bored to tears. A waste of time.
1,Matches the Title,"I found the dialogue between characters quite boring and could not bring myself to spend the time reading much more than the first 30 pages. Perhaps it is simply the shallow language of a pretend country club set on LI. If your time is valuable, skip this."
5,Awesome Hamptons Suspense Mystery,"Misfortune is one of the best mysteries I've ever read. Set in the bizarre world of Long Island High Society (can it get any more bizarre?) Frances must find a deadly killer among a cast of characters rich in dollars and drama. They come from Wall Street, Board Rooms, Hospitals and Country Clubs. They each hate the same person. Each suspect has a motive and a deep secret that must not be revealed. They will stop at nothing to protect themselves and shatter their adversaries as their very lives hang in the balance. This is detective work at it's best from a great new writer."
4,Power Panda,Good story well made technically. Funny most of the time with some underlying message - if you really want you can achieve anything - without a raised forefinger. I enjoyed the movie again viewing it a second time two months apart.
4,Kung Fu Panda 2 pack,I heard from my son how he really liked the Kung Fu Panda. We usually only buy animated movies for our Grandchildren. This time we decided to but it for ourselves and just say it is for the grandchildren when they come to visit. We really like the characters and the humor. This goes to show you are never too old for animated fun.
3,So why is this not a Special Edition item again?,"While the content is a nice collection of material on both discs, all of which aimed primarily at kids, it begs the question as to why this bundle was not made into a two-disc DVD special edition. There is not enough content on the second disc to warrent it being sold as a separate item, as implied by the trailer for Secrets of the Furious Five that runs in front of the Kung Fu Panda DVD. It is almost teasing people who didn't buy this version and bought the movie by itself.As far as the actual content, it is a nice and very complete set of material that will keep the young ones occupited for several hours as they go through each of the special features. Animation fans will love the 2-D ""sequel"" just as much as they love the main feature. And once you know the backstory to the Furious Five, they become that much more appealing as characters."
3,Nana's opinion,"My grandson found this video very entertaining. And he loves all the songs. He's only 3, so you know he was paying attention when he walks around singing them.Kung Fu Panda (Full Screen Edition)"
5,Good Movie!,"I LOVE this movie! It has a great theme that when you are called, if you believe, you can do it. FAITH!"
3,Secrets of Furious Five? Made me furious.,"I agree with all the other reviewers who said that this two-pack deal was not value for money. The feature movie was great! Ever since my nephews and nieces got it, they watch it twice a day! I would too if I could! They can now recite the lines along with the characters. So the 3-stars is for this DVD package. Frankly, the secrets of the Furious Five should just have been a DVD extra not packaged like we were getting another feature film. And the rest of the extras, while informative and even clever, was not so entertaining. Perhaps the main feature set the standard too high. Trying too hard to squeeze a few more bucks from the audience! But if you wanna know if you should get the movie (single pack/disc)? Yes! 5 stars for King Fu Panda. Hopes it wins an Oscar! It should win. The only other contender for best animation would be Wall.E"
5,this is a very cute movie,my grandson has watched this over and over again and has really enjoyed this movie. his dad also has watched this movie over and over again. they have really enjoyed the movie togather.
2,My review,"This just is not a grow up aminated movie and has little to offer in plot or story. But your kids will love it! My two watched it three times Chirstmas day after they got it from Santa and would have watched it a fourth, but three times was plenty!!!"
2,Beautiful watch but BIG,"I thought that the watch was beautiful, however the face of the watch is HUGE. It is hard to tell from the picture online, to me it looked like a normal sized watch. When I recieved it and put it on however, the face of the watch took up my entire wrist. I sent it back....it was just a little to blingy for me."
3,Extra Cash For Kids,"This book was good, not excellent. It had some useful and not so useful ideas. But otherwise give it a go."
5,"Excellent album, can't wait for the next one","This is now one of my favorite folk CDs. Danny has such a nice feel for melody, and the tunes work so well with the lyrics. He is obviously a very thoughtful and inspired musician, and I look forward to his next release in June."
4,A Really Cool Yule Collection,"Ever since this first came out about 9 years ago it gets plenty of playing time in my house. I have it on cassette & it's soon due to wear itself out & I will have to purchase it on cd. Anyway, for those that are major doo wop fans, you can't go wrong with this. The fun starts with Jingle Jangle by The Penguins as well as White Christmas by The Drifters. While I agree with my friend merc49 from Seattle that there are some obscure songs here, my only real complaint is that they should have included Dodie Stevens' version of Merry Merry Christmas, Baby rather than the one done by Margo Sylvia & The Tune Weavers. Dodie's was recorded back in 1960, I believe (or sometime in the early 60s), while Margo's was in 1988. All in all, a fun holiday collection. Now if only RHINO would consider compiling a 2nd volume to go along with this. Highly recommended."
4,What makes Christmas so nice?,"Obviously, this CD features doo wop Christmas songs. There are a number of absolute classics here, by the likes of the Penguins, the Drifters, the Cadillacs and the Orioles. And there are also several obscurities that are of somewhat lesser quality, but they are still good. Fans of vocal harmony will enjoy this CD."
3,Dexter by Schlage,"The only thing ""Dexter"" about Dexter by Schlage is the name. As a locksmith I was looking for a Dexter deadbolt for a customer. When I received the product in the mail and started to match the customer keys with the new lock, it was then I realized the keyway, spacings and depths were really Schlage ""C"" and had nothing to do with Dexter at all. I could have used a Schlage deadbolt to begin with and not had to order and wait for the lock."
3,Not much reading comprehension,"My child is a fluent reader, but has problem processing what he reads. I thought this book would help him. The book has many very easy tasks that have little to do with actual reading comprehension: sequence a set of 4 pictures, general question not about the story. Some exercises a good, but mostly this book is not for fluent readers who need help with comprehension."
5,Very helpful workbook,"Another great Scholastic reading comprehension book. My son completed this one first this summer before moving on to the third grade reading comprehansion book. Since this is something that is difficult for him, these workbooks really help him break it down. This workbook was the extra help he needed to really get the material."
3,Reading Comprehension Workbook,"I ordered this book thinking it was a reading comprehension resource book. However, it is a student workbook.It contains exercises that introduce the following skills: identifying the main idea, drawing conclusions, following directions, prediction, character analysis, cause & effect.I ordered the second grade level. It is a little thin and has approximately 43 pages of short activities. It is a nice book for use with thematic units."
4,A BOOK THAT MAKES YOU FEEL GOOD!,"101 Delightful, heartfelt stories that will grow in all the hearts that read it. A great read for everyone, whether you have a green thumb or not. An excellent gift for all gardener's too."
4,I'm rating the delivery.,"Since I gave this book as a Christmas present, I'm rating the condition of book as good and delivery was right on time. If you like other Chicken Soup for the Soul books,I'm sure you'll like this one."
2,Won't retract...,"The screen is nice but I had a hardest time trying to retract this screen. It kept getting longer and longer instead. I will return it. If you need to retract your screen after each use, this is not the one."
1,Doesn't go back up,Everything about this screen is great except that it does not retract! 3 people tried with no luck.
5,Excellent Product,I OWN IT AND IT`S GREAT FOR IN OR OUTDOORS TO KEEP YOUR BRUSH AWAY FROM EVERYTHING
2,May not fit all toothbrushes.....,"I purchased this toothbrush to protect toothbrushes that I take on frequent trips. I liked the idea that I could cover only the toothbrush head as I have found toothbrush covers that enclose the entire toothbrush tend to develop mold after a while. This toothbrush cover seemed like it would solve that problem.While the design does seem good my Oral B toothbrushes are just to full to fit. I can barely get it in if I push hard, but I really don't want to do that. Plus I'm sure that will break the toothbrush down rather quickly.However, if you use a thinner style toothbrush I see this cover working very well. The bottom and top have openings to allow water to drain out, which will also allow air to get in and dry the bristles."
4,Spacious,"I like this toothbrush cover, it is easy to use and it's easy to clean......I just wished that it came with more than two in the package"
1,Missing the Point,"The point that both sides miss: There is no where in any of the scouts aims, methods, programs or awards where it discusses homosexuality. God, yes. Sexual preference, no. Just leave scouting alone."
3,His Passion counts for Something,"Ah-haha-ha...Ollie North wrote the forward. I guess it's true, the Scout Oath and Law say nothing about ""Honest.""I love the Boy Scouts. In high school I chose scouting over other extracurricular activities. I didn't letter in football or baseball; I earned my Eagle Scout award.The Boy Scouts should be allowed to do what they want, but so should its critics. If the Boy Scouts can discriminate against homosexuals, bisexuals, and atheists, then Americans can discriminate against Scouting. The emotional assaults by each side illustrates the need for courtesy (a point of the Scout Law).I can only hope that over time, the Boy Scouts will change its policy. BTW...could you imagine if the Boy Scouts hadn't changed their racial policies?"
2,It about killed my plants,"Perhaps I misunderstood and this product should only be used to winter-proof plants? The label does not specify seasonal usage. I thought it would protect broad leaf plants from the hot, dry summer weather. However, I sprayed it on my hydrangea bush as directed and it about killed all of the leaves and turned the flowers brown also. Obviously I wouldn't be using it to winter proof a hydrangea since they loose their leaves in the winter. Not going to try it on anything else in any season at all."
5,Characters who live their faith,"Merrillee Whren's The Heart's Homecoming is a tender story of self-realization and forgiveness between two people who have hurt one another and want to make it right. Sam and Jillian are aware of their mistakes and often stumble on the way to their separate redemptions before they can find one another again.Whren's writing has a charm and simplicity that highlights the story and makes each twist in the tale believable. The minor characters are likeable and their ""people next door"" quality enhances the main plot of the book.The Heart's Homecoming will warm your heart, too."
5,a timeless classic,"The JPS Torah commentary series is among the best. Too brief, regrettably, but what's there is excellent."
5,This Should Be Required Reading to Get a Driver's License!,"What can I say? A masterwork and fitting monument to all who gave their lives in conflict and especially those who made the ultimate sacrifice in the defense of liberty.This is a book you will re-read more than James Joyce's ""The Dubliners."" It's impossible to absorb it all in one or two cover-to-cover attempts. Kind of like trying to eat Thanksgiving Dinner through a drinking straw...there's so much here, and it's so well written, you'll be happy to pick it up again and again, slowly digesting this feast of knowledge...""Delivered from Evil"" has launched me on a quest to read as much as I can on the Pacific Theater. I'm going to read Leckie's Guadalcanal treatment next.You owe it to yourself -- and all who fought in WWII -- to read this book and pass it along to a friend or loved one."
3,I Like the Bag But ...,Item does not come as it appears in the image. There is large white lettering just above that plastic window that reads: MASSAGE CHAIR CARRY CASE. I only wanted the bage for its non discript appearance. Now I have to haul it around with that ugly lettering displayed on the side of it. I would not have purchased the item if the advertising image reflected what the item REALLY looked like.
4,Great tool!,"We use this book often, it helps the children remember what they are meditaiting on and they have asked more questions becasue of it. I have found that it makes a great gift when given with a Rosary."
5,A really great guide,"The author dropped off the corporate ladder to travel the U.S. and Canada to bring us an insightful guide to adventure travel accomodations. The guide is easy to use and fun to read. The book is full of pictures (including inside pictures). As an added bonus, the book is lightweight so it won't be a chore to carry."
5,A Truly Wonderful Resource for any home,"As parents, most of us want to share our faith with our children by teaching, but also by truly living our faith in our homes. This new book by the wonderfully talented Ann Ball will become one of your most used resources in this goal!Ann Ball shares a project for every day of the year in this great book. Topics included are crafts, recipes related to the liturgical seasons, gardening tips and ideas and much more.The photos which accompany each project will encourage you to try some new things with your family or students.Templates and easy to follow directions for the crafts and recipes make this a great resource for crafters and chefs of any experience level. The book is chock full of wonderful stories, information, and lore related to our beautiful Catholic traditions.This book is one of my new favorites, and I know that you and your family will love it too!"
4,Nice Book,"I received my order in a timely manner and was well pleased. The book is supposedly used, but it appears to be new. Thanks so much!"
4,Bad prices.,Do not buy this book at these prices! 900.00 dollars! are you insane. These people are trying to rip you off.
2,Motor is underdimensioned,"Pros: Easy to clean. Solid cast aluminium chasis.Cons: After slicing just a few cabbages, the motor got extremely hot and the slicer began to smell. The 10-minute per hour duty cycle as the manual recomends is too little for any serious work. My unit will die soon from motor damage.The safety switch will cause cramps if you have to hold it down for more than a few minutes."
5,The best of the best,This is such a wonderful slicer. It is very easy to handle and most importantly can be cleaned in a short time. It's perfect for a bonless ham. I would definately say this is a must for anybody with a large family. It is well worth the investment!
5,Enlightening Eye -Opener,"This poignant examination of print media advertising's subliminal selling techniques in the 70s comes from a time before digital enhancements and computers, and should definitely provoke anyone to ask ""if they were that good then, what are they doing to us now?!?"""
1,Paranoid Lunatic,"If you have done any research at all, you would know that the author is a raving paranoid lunatic."
4,Life Isn't Fair Shirt,"Love the shirt, no real problems with it. Only thing I would complain about it is that the neck fits a little funny...though that may be because I am a girl and this is a mens shirt."
2,This may be an improvement over what I bought 20 years ago,"As at least one reviewer pointed out, the version of this that I bought was disappointing. A lot of the songs were watered down and cut off. Who I wonder was the brain dead moron that cut the intro to Cinderella off? As was pointed out, Strange Way also endured this fate and others as well.I see that in the songlist here that it says album version by all songs. If that is the case, then I didnt wait long enough to buy this. If this is a true compilation of the songs as they appeared on the albums, I may be inclined to buy it again."
4,Help!!,"Every Christmas one of the radio stations here in the LA area (KOST 103.5) plays a Firefall song called ""Merry Christmas Baby"" but I've never seen this on any Firefall release. KOST says it came from a compiliation but couldn't be more specific than that. Anyone got any info on this?? Many thanks for your help"
2,Standard 70's MOR,"Ho hum. This is standard 70's MOR, nothing more, nothing less. This is a collection of these Eagles wannabes radio hits and some lesser known tracks."
1,The Best MOR Band..(.which isn't saying much),"It's really hard to write a serious review of this group or any other 70's lightweight pap bands. There's one good song here, ""Strange Way"" but otherwise it's mostly trite stuff that is better off forgotten. Your better off searching out a mid-late 70's compilation CD rather than paying full price for a CD with 1 song and a bunch of filler."
4,Really smooth-flow to this CD.,"Firefall is a band that most folks overlook outside of Seventies compilation CDs. There is a whole side to this band that didn't make it into the public consciousness, and this CD exhibits it perfectly. Enjoy the top 10 singles but spend your flights and your office hours with the entire CD - you will find yourself leaving the settings on ""repeat entire CD""."
3,Best Firefall Compilation Out There!,"If you are into very soft ""rock"" or are into Adult Oriented Rock of the 70's and early 80's, then you'll just love this band. All the tracks here have been remastered by Rhino and so you know you're going to get good sound quality: all 18 of them! Good value for money and worth the 3 stars for ""Always"", ""You Are the Woman"" and ""Just Remember I Love You"" with the rest of the tracks being rather forgettable. Good harmonies over mellow, soft rock but one can't help but think that there were so many others out there during their time who have done that particular genre a whole lot more justice than this band. I'd say Firefall is maybe two thirds as good as Orleans with regards the quality of their songs and maybe only a third as good as Ambrosia, Player etc. Still, if you are into this band, this version is probably the best overall best of compilation that's out there."
4,I never realized that I liked this band!,"I just saw them at the KY state fair with Rick Springfield a few days ago. I didn't realize how many of their songs that I knew, but didn't know who had recorded them.Anyway, they totally rocked onstage, so of course I had to come here and order some of their music! They performed most, if not all of the songs on this CD at th fair, so I'd highly recommend it."
2,"Where Can I get the actual version of ""Strange Way""","This would have been 5 stars, until they ripped me off with the slashed version of Strange Way that has been shortened so poorly that it never sounded like that on the radio. Has their record company have ANY album with the regular full-length version of the classic song ""Strange Way""? This CD has only the cheap 3:26 version of 'Strange Way' when the LP had the whole 4:45 version of the song. The VINYL LP is better than this newer CD. Hey Atlantic/WEA: how about a CD with the ""LP version"" of the songs - unless you want to call it ""The Singles""?"
1,Sorry but not interested......,"I found the entire book to be predictable and uninteresting. I am a huge fan of adventure/military fiction, but this one, unfortunately right after I read rainbow 6 (another loser) makes me reconsider. Try Cobb - Sea Strike instead or Steven Hunter."
2,Very improbable,"I'm sorry. There are a bunch of 5 star reviews on this book and I just don't get it. Let's see - 3 best friends from law school are now the chief aide to the Speaker of the House, a counsel to the President and the top clerk to the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. That's just preposterous.I also have a hard time accepting the basic premise of a Navy Admiral disobeying the Commander in Chief.The book seemed to have a distinct right-wing conservative philosophy - if that works for you go for it."
1,"Good plot, but a waste","I bought the book, hoping it would be an interesting summer read. It had a great premise, a battle between Congress and the President, so the timeliness was attractive. Unfortunately, the action was anti-climactic, both on the political and on the military side. Characters were not well thought out, and could easily be lost in the shuffle. In the end, it was unsatisfying, and I missed the money I had dropped on buying it."
4,A good read and an interesting plot.,"I was really impressed with the author's knowledge of Washington politics, naval procedures, and the constitution. Like a Clancy novel, this scenario could actually play out in real life - scary, huh?"
5,Definatly has Bestseller Potential! Great Book!,"I know the Author personally...and I must admit I am suprised! This book shows _Obvious_ expertise and love for the Navy and Law. A book of this much power and ""finger bitting action"" could only come from a Retired Navy Officer and Lawyer in one! Congratz Mr. Huston on a EXCELLENT book!"
4,Clancy has some competition!,This was a book that I had a lot of dificulties putting down. It is very rare to have such a GRIPPING political AND military thriller bundled into one. It was like reading two great stories at the same time. The only down side was that some of the transitional scenes were a little weak but it was not enought to drag down the story. A MUST READ! When is Houston's next book coming out?!?!
2,Dot Matrix Ribbons Essentially Dried Out,"Purchased 4 ribbons from separate sources at 30% of ""new"" at office store. Using old dot matrix printer to make 2 part forms for low cost dog immuniztion clinic....ribbons worked for about 25 pages then lightened to unuseable. Original ribbons worked for 100s. Searched internet and found solutions to reink...managed to get a little more use. These ribbons were just old, sealed, but dried out. No expiration date should be clue. Would be a big problem in office with deadlines...okay for 501c3 volunteer retirees. Next year will buy new and hope they aren't dried out too"
5,Mozturbation.,"This is a great book. It provides a deep-dish psychological insight and fanalysis into Morrissey, and also more alliteration and word-bouncery than any sane human being could ever want. It's very well written, and any true Moz fanatic couldn't do any better than read this. I love The Smiths and I loved this. 'Nuff said."
5,Great insight into ambiguous Morrissey lyrics,"Offers American readers further insight into Morrissey's English-ness in regards to his lyrics and cultural background. Sheds light on a lot of lyrical passages I hadn't fully understood the origin or meaning of. Great read, even for exclusively Smith fans."
2,B&D Clipper,"I find these clippers to be OK - the battery holds its charge longer than the earlier B&D model. However, the clipper isn't particularly good, requires multiple passes over an area to trim it."
1,instuctions wrong,"The piece I ordered was changed to one that would not fit. I called black and decker, they said it would not work even though the instructuions that came with it said it would."
2,Uncomfortable and not very useful,"The pole was made with an angle that makes it too hard to work with. It is definitely uncomfortable, that's why I chose to put it away and keep on working with the shear/shrubber by itself."
4,Extension Handle,Great back saving product that works as advertised. The only cons are:(1) The trigger mechanism on the extension handle is difficult to depress and keep depressed while using the shears.(2) It is very difficult to remove the shears from the extension handle when needed.
1,Wheels,"The product works when the wheels stay on, which is not for long. I cannot believe that they do not have some way to fasten them to the axle that would allow it to work. Otherwise, it is a pretty good machine. But without the wheels - useless."
2,Not Worth It,"This extension handle does what it is intended to do. Unfortunately, the shear/shrubber for which it is designed to use is a worthless due to its lack of cutting ability. Black & Decker makes a lot of poor quality items but my experience is that the shear/shrubber is among the worst which makes this extension useless."
1,Usetless,"This tool makes the top five useless tools I have ever purchased. As far as I can see, there are no defects, it just doesn't have enough power to cut anything heavier than a couple of blades of grass. I guess I will stick with the string wackers and put up with the occasionally ""missing"" flower."
4,Black and Decker extension wand,"I like the product I bought from you. My father bought one at the store a few years ago to use with his trimmer. I thought I could go to the store and buy one also. But they now have a new model of trimmer out that doesn't fit the extension wand. I was bummed until I saw I could order one from you from the Black and Decker website.It was easy to set up and when I want to use it without the extension it is also easy to take off. Over all I like it, now I don't have to bend down to do any trimming unless I want to.The only drawback it a button on the wand that is hard to push at the same time as the trigger for it to operate. It is a safety button. Other than that I have no complaints and would recommend this product for anyone who was thinking of buying it. The price was also kind of reasonable."
2,Disappointed,"Shears didn't lock well onto extension handle. I wound up duct taping. Really. Then the ""on"" buttons on the extension handle worked 50% of the time plus the power of the shears was diminished when it did work. I checked and the power connection was tight. All in all, I am VERY disappointed in the quality of this product while I like my trimmer/shears."
1,Worthless,"This handle is a good idea but worthless. The wheels fall off, the triggers to make it run are hard to hold and it doesn't hold the clippers at a comfortable angle. I finally took it off, used the clippers without the handle and did my yardwork in half the time."
2,Current design has problems,"The concept of the extension handle is great, but no matter what I try I can't get the wheels to stay on the axle. I have tried pushing hard, even gluing, but as soon as you put it on the ground and try to roll it, the wheels fall off. So it is totally useless for the expected purpose. They need to either but screws on the axle and the wheels, or provide a more secure meth9d of attaching the wheels, such as putting holes on the axle and use cotter pins."
2,Worthless,"This really sounded great because I use my battery operated clippers a lot and even edge with them. I thought it would be great to be able to ""push them along"", but.... First, it sits too high from the ground to tackle edging and quite frankly, what else would you use it for. Also, the wheels will not stay on. I've tried everything and after pushing a few feet, one will fall off. After a few tries at using this handle, I've thrown it in the corner of garage, it's useless to me."
1,handle,this is poorly constructed. it did not attach as it should and the parts would not stay on. I would not recommend it.
3,Wheels situation,"I was looking forward to attaching this extension handle to the grass clippers. There is a major problem. The wheels will not stay on the grass clippers. Upon examination, there is absolutely nothing to keep the wheels from falling off. I am not the only person that has this problem. Consequently, I cannot use the extension handle with the wheels but have to physically hold the handle & clippers at the height needed. I hope this can be rectified. I do wish I had known about this problem before buyig the extension handle. A waste of money unless I can find someone with a solution!"
2,Very uncomfortable to use,"Maybe it's because I am short, but the handle on this thing is just the wrong size! It makes me hold one arm/elbow or another at a very uncomfortable angle, in order to hold the button down while trimming. I am NOT using the wheels, but trying to trim more like a weedwacker.I would Not Recommend this for below average sized men or women."
1,Broken,"I received an extension handle that was broken and would not lock to continue running. The orange pc the tool snaps onto was outside of its slot and I had to file it down and then force it in with a screwdriver and hammer. One interior (black pc) flange was busted off so the trimmer tool flips to one side. I have to order another one because I am a 62 yr old, disabled Grandma and do not have full use of my hands. The Black & Decker tools themselves are great, but someone sent me a returned handle extension and not what was advertised as being new. Disgusted with the ripoff artist."
3,Very Functional,"This unit is a great addition to the B & D battery operated trimmer. Saves the back and neck muscles from straining when stooping and bending to trim lawn areas. One complaint, the safety and switch are hard to keep ""on"" at the same time so I jumped the safety and now it is easier to operate. Overall a good product."
2,Wish it worked better,"The idea is GREAT! Now how do I get the little wheels to stay on?? The switches work well and the handle is comfortable, but the wheels keep falling off."
4,Save Your Knees and Back,I bought this little gem to save my knees while trimming the grass between the stones of my walkway. It works quite well and the wheels are a nice touch.
2,Black & Decker GSH1000 Shear/Shrubber Extension Handle Black & Decker,I feel this has a lot of potential.I haven't been able to keep the wheels on it yet. and the grass was to rank at thistime of year to work good. Need a lock nut to keep the wheels on it and have nicenew fresh grass to make it work. I will hopefully find a lock nut for the wheels andenjoy it this spring.
1,Wish I had heeded the reviews,You guys are right. Chilton used to be synonomous with quality. What a useless product. Cars have become so complicated how could I have beleived Chilton could have covered so much information in so few pages. Well they didn't and couldn't so I would like a refund.
1,Why is AMAZON marketing this book?,In all the years as a weekend mechanic I have never seen a book with more sketchy information. They would have been better off focusing on one model than trying to cram every vehicle from 1995-1999 in one 1400 page book. The price is outrageous!
1,Vague Vague Vague!!!,"It doesn't make sense for any body to buy this book. There is a whole bunch of useless info in here. Don't get me wrong they filled up 1400 hundred pages with info that at first glance it appears like it could be usefull but it isn't. It appears like they took the owners manual from the glove compartment and puffed it up alittle. Nothing of any value in it. Waste of fourty bucks! Stick with Haynes, much more info, much less money!"
3,I find the book adequate for my needs,"I'm no ""Technician"", but the Chilton book suits my needs just fine.I do a few things like oil changes and tire rotations on the weekends. All the specifications for oil and coolant capacities are there. It's got lug nut torque and firing orders and stuff like that. There's no anti-lock brakes or fuel injection, but I wouldn't try to fix that scary stuff anyway.All in all, I'd say it's an OK book, at least for my purposes."
5,The Art of Education,"I have just read The Art Of Education for the fourth time. This time with a highlighter. I wish that I would have found it before we finished our home education journey. Linda's manages to light a fire in your mind. As a leader of a statewide support network, I will recommend this to all new home educators as a must read."
4,Represented God well,"We used this costume at our church to represent God in our Christmas program. We used the ""scarf"" over God's head, instead of over his shoulder, and added a beard. Appropriately, from a side profile, no one could see the face of God. It worked well."
3,Not bad but could be better,"I liked the white party cd's better because each song blends well with each other. The songs which DJ David Knapp chose here do not. Sorry David, But don't start blowing your trumpets yet. Just choose your songs wisely on your next CD. I see you have potential. So let us see what you are really made of."
5,A great book for peeps who dont like to read!,This was a great book for readers in the grades 6-8. I read it for a summer packet report and i really hate to read. This book is one of my fav. books because it has some drama and stuff like that! It left you on the edge at some points of the book and the end was like a cliff hanger. But it was a great book and it all came to a great finish like all of her other books. If you want a good book that doesnt take long to read and is easy to read choose dog friday
5,A great English written novel! Icould not put it down!,The book was very very very very very very very very great and funny
1,barely worked,"According to the product specification, it should work with HP Laserjet 3200. After installation, it worked normal for 2 pages. Then, the drum started humming. Then, papers are jammed all the time. Finally, the printer stopped working. Since this product is fulfilled by Amazon, the returning process is easy. I still waiting for the refund at this point. I subsequently purchased the Xerox one which works much better then this product."
5,Good Replacement Cartridge,I haveseen some people complain about certain remanufactured printer cartridges but this one I purchased has worked perfectly every bit as good as a new HP cartridge at a fraction of the price.
5,one of the best artists for meditation music,I came across Tom Kenyon in a book and decided to look into his music. I bought this cd based on the other reviews and it is WONDERFUL. It's difficult (for me) to find good music to meditate to; I prefer meditating is silence. Tom is very talented at inducing alpha and theta states. I feel refreshed and fantastic after meditating to his music. Sometimes I'll even put it on to cook or wash dishes to and everything just feels easier when I have his music playing.I bought 4 of his cds and am looking forward to owning more. :) 2 thumbs up is my vote!
2,ok...not for me..........,I've heard so much about Tom Kenyon......Songs of Magdalen....was just not for me....nothing special...and I will be donating this to the public library!~
5,The Original (and best) Surf/Punk Hybrid,"Do you like punk rock? Do you like surf music? If the answer is yes to either or both, then you have a HUGE gap in your record collection if you don't have this CD. It's really difficult to imagine anyone purchasing this record and being disappointed."
2,Don't expect oldschool,"I bought this cd awhile ago and was mostly dissatisfied with it. I heard people talking about Agent Orange as one of the best oldschool punk bands. After I shelled out the money to buy it, I was dissapointed to say the least. I was expecting a semi-hardcore (with some pop/punk) band and instead I found surf punk. I think that the best way to describe this cd is SURF PUNK. It has alot more poppy new-waveishness than i wanted to hear. Although the last 5 songs are perfect examples of Hardcore Oldschool Punk, its not enough for me to listen to the rest of the cd."
2,A Marxian Change of Pace,"Based on the hit Broadway play, ""Room Service"" (1938) remains the only film not written specifically for the Marx Brothers. Except for a few priceless moments, this hectic farce never gels. Groucho, Harpo and Chico are shackled by William A. Seiter's lethargic direction and an incompatible supporting cast. The reliable presence of Margaret Dumont is sorely missed. ""Room Service"" should be viewed as a well-intentioned, yet unsuccessful experiment."
4,"Different, but not bad","This is definitely different than other Marx brothers movies. I think the main reason is that the material wasn't written for them specifically. In fact, they even had to write in a part for Harpo. So yeah, there was no Harpo on the harp, or Chico on the piano, or any moments of utter Marx madness which keeps me in stitches (unless you count Harpo chasing the turkey around the room, and breaking every single breakable thing there in his attempts). The good thing about this movie is, it's still funny. And it wasn't JUST the Marx boys that made it funny - the plot actually had some depth to it too. Which made it almost hard for me to follow at times. But I thought the ending was great. Especially Groucho & Chico just sitting there singing ""Swing Low Sweet Chariot"", and then seeing the same thing in a play a few minutes later...Yeah, hard to explain. If you like the Marx brothers, I'd recommend you watch this - it's different, but not terrible either."
2,A highly watered-down Marx picture,This is probably the dullest Marx picture I've ever seen. The boys were made more like accessories and not lead actors in this film. The slpastick and double entende so prominent in many of their films is absent here. Even Lucille Ball's appearance can't save this movie. Margaret Dumont definately was needed in this picture along with some better writing.
2,"If it weren't for Lucy, this movie would have been awful","The only thing that saves this movie is the multi-talented Lucille Ball. She is not in a comedy role, but she lights up the screen with her beautiful face. She had such presence. The Marx brothers have thier funny moments as well, but I think the real star is Lucy."
5,Best Jewish Comedy Recording Ever!!!,"I had this one as a record as a nine year old and wore it out. I have sung ""The Ballad of Irving"" to my children. Now that I found the CD, they can hear it in tune. Nu?"
5,Still a favorite after 40+ years,"I (Bible-Belt Baptist) moved to Miami (from the largely Catholic Cleveland) in 10th grade and began babysitting for a wonderful Jewish family across the street. I think I played their ""You Don't Have to be Jewish"" at least once a week for the next 2.5 years! For HS Graduation, they gave me ""When You're in Love"", so then my whole family had to listen to it at least once a week. I tried unsuccessfully for years to find a copy of the 1st album and was absolutely delighted when I found this re-release a few years ago -- with both albums! I no longer play it as often -- but then I still have most of it memorized. ""Irving"" was my Dad's favorite, ""Call from Long Island"" is mine, and we all love the shtick. It resides (mp3 format) on my desktop, laptop, old PalmPilot, & new smart phone -- never far away..."
2,Borsht Belt Comedy and old jokes,"The humor is dated, and the delivery is slow. Picture a geriatric Laugh-In. Most of the jokes are so old that you already know the punch lines. I really didn't get my money's worth."
1,romantic comedy?,"This movie said it was a romantic comedy. There was nothing funny or romantic about it. The background music was appalling and distracting. It had absolutely nothing to do with the movie or its characters. Other than Bruce greenwood, there was nothing to like about this movie. It was a complete bore."
2,Romantic Comedy?! This movie is awkward....,"I thought this movie was freakishly awkward. If you read all the negative reviews in this thread (prior to my post) I would have to say I agree pretty much with everything they say. I don't know if the positive reviews are real or not (we all know that people tend to 'puff up' ratings on everything from products, food to movies....) however, with that said, I cannot agree more than all the negative reviews regarding the music not matching, the people not being believable, the feeling of being left cold at the end. I'm sure some people like this type of movie. I am not one of them. My wife loves romantic comedies and she even thought this was weird. I have to say that yes... this was freakishly weird in an uninteresting way...I recently saw 'the Devil wears Prada' and that was actually good and watchable. This movie I would not recommend. Not the worse but I would give it 1 1/2 stars if i could."
2,Bleh,"This wasn't the worst movie I've ever seen but it's very forgettable. Being that this is story based on love, you need to buy into & believe in the love that is being portrayed. You want to connect with the characters & cheer them on. I couldn't have cared less about their love story. I didn't buy into it. I was totally uninterested in it. It was bleh. I wasn't drawn into their story at all."
3,Under the microscope,"To begin with, I didn't know what to expect from this movie. I rented it because the reviews seemed favorable and the price was right. I think that while the characters were likable, at the core there was no soul. Perhaps it was the winter scenes of Canada but the movie left me cold. Or perhaps it was a by-product of the cinematography. There was a lack of warmth until near the very end of the movie. The female lead's discussions of love with her father struck me as analytical and sterile. It was as if they were discussing intimate relationships at arms length. This was at odds with the intimate scenes in the bedroom and other places that were best left to the imagination. Perhaps it was the scripted reserve of the characters, but I think there was a lot left unsaid. Love prevailed in the end, I don't think we really know why."
2,POOR,That movie was poor in everyway. So predictable and unrealistic. And the music...it didn't even go with the theme or style of movie. Don't waste your time or money.
3,Enjoyed a classic,"As expected, the movie was ridiculous and somewhat humorous based on how old it is, however, I enjoyed seeing it."
1,Truth or Dare,"Do you dare to believe that this ""story"" is true? We , the readers are told to dare to believe, yet it is well known that the author is writing a fictive memoir, a story full of metaphor for a culture that no longer dares to believe the imaginal realms are true. The problem is if the author is actually experiencing it on the imaginal plane, but dares to say it is as real as you reading this then how can we be any more confused as a seeker, looking for something to believe in. Call it for what it is, we do not need to have teachers leading us down anymore darkened roads, we need teachers that dare to say the imaginal is as real as anything and therefore hold that up as a guiding light. Tell the Truth."
3,a dancer's heart,"""The Jewel Heart"" is not my favorite book by Barbara Helen Berger. It is the first book by her that I've read that has not blown me away. Still, I can see quite clearly how a book like this would move the heart of a dancer.Both my wife and daughter have danced some ballet. So I was not surprised when my daughter really enjoyed this book.This little tale about the relationship between Gemino and Pavelle is quite interesting. Like the rest of Berger's stuff, it is a clear enough story to read once to a child. At the same time, it is deep enough to bear some reflecting on by mature kids and mature adults.I wish I could give ""The Jewel Heart"" three and a half stars. It is, like all of Berger's books, worth reading. It is just not my personal favorite. That said, I recommend it."
1,Useless,"Requires a special adapter. Can't be inflated with a standard pump needle, like most fenders/buoys. Couldn't find an adapter online, at West Marine, or at local marina. A deflated buoy is useless. Would be much better to have purchased one with a standard fitting for a pump needle."
2,i really wanted to like it,i think what the author is trying is interesting. i just think he needs a bit more polish on the dialog. additionaly some of the 'logic' used by the author for character motivations and reactions was unlikely at best.
1,Juvenile Writing Style,"I have no idea what book the other reviews were reading when they state ""good story"" and ""good writing"". This was a laughable attempt at writing to me. It appeared at time like a 7th grader was writing it. Each spoken dialogue ended with ""I said"", ""she said"", ""he said"". It showed NO imagingination or craft AT ALL. Only a short step below Stephanie Meyer for age range. Thank God it was free."
1,not satisfied,This book of short stories left me completely unsatisfied. The first story I enjoyed but was disappointed it didn't go farther. The second story was even less satisfying. I won't waste my time with the third. At least the price (free) was right.
2,It's a good start...,"As some of the other reviewers noted, this book has a lot of potential. There are some great story ideas, but they are pretty much just that- ideas. I would have liked the stories better if there had been more character development. It felt like the stories ended just as I was really starting to get into the characters. It also might have been nice if all the stories somehow came together. Perhaps they do in a printed version (the kindle version only has 3 or 4 stories), but it was somewhat disconcerting to jump from one story to another without any real connection between them."
2,Couldn't finish it.,"I tried really hard to like this book but just couldn't make it work. The plot line in the Kiribati test is jagged; one moment the lead character is trying to keep his head down and in the next his wife is literally being offered spa treatments. The story is filled with details that don't seem to add anything to the story line in one moment, only to forget to take the time to provide details that might explain seemingly bizarre behavior."
1,The Kiribati Test,"This book has three separate stories that do not connect. It is almost like the author of the book had three very good book ideas but never fully elaborated on each of them. If the author of the book played out each story making each one it's own book it would have been good. Instead there are three different stories that don't relate into one book. Either I am not getting why he did this and am just ignorant or the book is not written well, not thought out well, and is a waste of time."
4,an entertaining read,"It doesn't look like the person who wrote the above review even read the book, so I thought I would offer a perspective on the actual writing. I found some of the stories in the book to be really ingenious. ""The Quiet Couple"" gives a wonderful, realistic perspective on interaction in relationships, and the dialogue is entertaining and fast-paced. I also liked ""The Kirabati Test,"" a light science fiction story with an innovative premise. The stories are a little uneven in parts of the collection and cover a variety of genres, but that also shows the author's range and potential. Overall I found the book very entertaining."
2,So much potential,"The book, ""The Kiribati Test"", had lots of potential to be a great read, however it fell far short of it's potential.With one exception, all of the characters were under-developed. There are many plot items that are unexplored, and then the book just seems to end. There was no closure, no sense that the book was supposed to end. It just ended.The included short story, ""Cuda"", was much the same way.The one redeeming thing about this book is the short story ""The Con Artists"". There was just enough development to make it worth a read.Overall, I can not recommend this book."
2,So-so,"This book is OK, considering that it is free (for the Kindle). If I'd paid for it, I'd be disappointed. The writer's ideas are not bad, but they are a little predictable and not terribly unique. The writing itself needs some serious editing. There are places where the author seems to lose focus on the story, and there are a number of grammitcal errors."
1,Needs plot polish.,"The theme for these three stories is similar, the plots similar in one. In each, there's some skillful character devlopment, a situation contrived, and then a rush to a premature solution that collapses suspense and ends the story.I found them disturbing only in the observation that they each are too thinly written."
3,Good If You Have the Financial Resources.,"Train At Home To Work At Home: How To Get Certified, Earn A Degree, Or Take A Class From Home To begin A Work-At-Home Career by Michelle McGarry is a good book.I might argue that the main reason that most folks want to work at home is to earn money. Money that they may not have intially to take the courses that she suggest.It might be better to use an online resource like pennyperclick.com to earn the money for the classes first."
3,Critical Times,"I heard the tapes while on a long trip, and I have to admit that is not the perfect setting to listening to these. The voice is not relaxing, and neither are the concepts as positive as they may be. I think they tend to turn one into a little more self-conscious individual. However, on the positive side, some of the tips that were given were ok and a bright spot was the one about self-criticism."
5,THE HISTORY OF THE JEWISH MIGRANTS TO THE AMAZON,"This is a book about the history of the Jewish people in the Amazon region. I am somewhat biased to speak about it, as I am the grandson of the author.The book focuses on tracking the history of the Jewish migration that took place mostly in the 19th century from Morocco to the Brazilian Amazon. These immigrants were and are an integral part of the communities today living in the region, though the vast majority either live in the largest cities (Manaus and Belem) or have moved to Rio or Sao Paulo. There are tables listing all the families that migrated to the region, as well as lists of all burials in local Jewish cemeteries. It also explains a bit the motives behind the migration (anti-Semitism in Morocco coupled with economic opportunity in Brazil).If you would like a copy of this book, I would be happy to get one for you, just send me an e-mail."
5,Great Read,"See my lengthy review under the Seasons End, the last book in this series of three. These are rich and fantastic books, dark but full of thrills and chills!"
1,Cute bad fit,"This shoe would have been ideal except for the fit. It was too short and the toe area too flat. I have worn VanEli 8N for years, but this was not comfortable."
1,uncomfortable,Not a very comfortable shoe. I dont know if it's me or the shoe. My toes feel pinched and hurt after a while of wearing. Have not had this problem with other shoes I own. Even pointy toed ones. Problem may be with the shoe design.
2,The Perfect Bride,"Sammi Davis stars as a psycho bride who wants to prove to herself that her new husband is not like most men - piggish and self-occupied - and when she is eventually deceived, she plots his murder and the murder of friends and family of his who get in the way. Even the chase scene towards the end and the performances of Kelly Present and Davis can't make up for the otherwise bore and amateurish feeling of this film. The script is written as though it were a SCT skit, and the stunts are terrible. It's often entertaining in some ways, but the majority of the time, you're left sitting there looking at the screen and thinking: ""Did I once have that sort of haircut?"""
1,bad copy,I thought I paid for DVD's and they are tapes and most of THEM are copied and are not even clear!!! SO SAD
1,yuck,"I have had this about a year. Not really into baking, I have only used it 5 times. Totally CHEAP! It is already in the trash. Do not waste your time."
1,Sifter rusted when we put it in the dishwasher,"We purchased the sifter after looking at several. This one was advertised as stainless steel and dishwasher safe. We liked the large capacity but since we live in the humid south, the rust is a great concern. When we received the sifter and removed the labels, we ran it through our dishwasher, on the top rack under normal conditions. We were dismayed to find that there were large rust spots on the internal mechanical parts of the sifter. We are very disappointed!"
3,it works ... but only 1 cup at a time,"This sifter works really well if you only measure 1 cup at a time. If you try to load it with more than a cup, it will start sticking & it will just take 3x as long to get the flour out. I also don't recommend using wheat flour- it'll stick with just a cup. Aside from that, it's great. I make bread everyday & so I get a lot of use out of it."
2,Don't waste your money,"I got this sifter because my old one was a last-generation inheritance and on its last legs, but I swear, the old one works better than this one does. Two sifts in, you have to hit the side to get the flour to move around, and, worse, its inner gears are either rusting or wearing away to discoloration after only a month of using it every morning for pancakes. For the time being, I'm going back to my ancient sifter."
5,Back for another one.,Dropped my first Joyce Chen Tea Kettle and had not been able to find a replacement until it recently showed up on Amazon again for purchase. First purchase was made from Amazon and was greatful to find it a second time around. I am a true tea drinker and would highly recommend this tea kettle to all.
4,Great Product,"Bought this for an avid tea drinker for Christmas. He absolutely loves it, and the fact that it came with a bamboo handle that never gets hot is another plus. He uses it about everyday and it seems to be holding up very well."
3,Poor quality control,"I love these tea kettles and have purchased several in the last ten years. This vendor,however, sent kettles that had imperfections -- they were chipped, lacked a luster on the finish, or didn't have a smooth finish. Too bad. I know my Joyce Chen kettles, so I sent them back."
2,Great while it lasted,"Loved the tea kettle, however, after two months it developed a major crack and started leaking. I took all the precautions and read reviews on how to take care of the product, but it still failed. Now I'm out $40.00. I don't think that the cermaic holds up well to a gas burner, even though the manufacturer says you can use this kettle on such burners."
3,"Great kettle, problem is that it explodes","I love this kettle, mostly the fact that it is ceramic and doesn't give a metal taste. There is a major issue with it though, it tends to explode, hence the 3-star review. Occasionally small pieces get flying around when it gets hot on the stove. It does seem a bit hazardous, but I think I will buy a second one anyway. The first one has a huge whole at the bottom due to one of the explosions."
3,"Lovely, limited.","Adding to the above review.....it truly is lovely, but the heat resistant handle gave in on mine and trying to replace it has been frustrating so far--in addition to the limitations described above."
3,what do you do with a cracked tea kettle?,"Got this tea kettle as a gift two years ago. I wanted a ceramic pot and was so pleased to get it. We use it very regularly, and have NEVER let it boil dry. Last night, heated some water, set it back down on the stove, and it made a ""popping"" sound and cracked. It hadn't been banged on anything, or handled roughly. Not sure why it happened, but also not sure I want another ceramic one? Just saying."
3,NOT THE BEST,"Here is a perfect example of a film that had everything going for it but it did not make it. It got lost in Cannes. The best known actors took a part in this film. Everyone was well known and rightly so. Location was perfect. The screen play could make the screen play of the year. The idea was a really good one. So, what happened? Why such great actors didn't know what to do and how to handle the part, and the film was not filmed right and the complecity of the screen play was lost right on the beginning? Where did the passion go? Was it a director? Or everyone thought that they were so great already that nothing else was needed? I don't really know what happened there but in my book this film made only two stars but out of respect for the best I gave it three stars."
1,Can it!,"Bored blowhards bragging and bluffing; film industry movers or pretenders attempting to do business and attempting to have relationships and then. . .it's over. The film is clever at the start, unsatisfactorily developed in the middle, and, at the end, abandoned. Leave it be."
4,this behavior continues even today,"That this story takes place in what is now a peaceful area does not take away from the fact that this behavior continues. Even the news this week of the events in Colombia of our Secret Service and military bears out that we must consider the impact of the Ugly American and the image we project as ""peace-keepers"" (USN Ret.)"
4,Better than average issue movie,"Better than average issue movie. Often sacrifices delving into the characters in favor of delving into the issues, but the actors are good enough to minimize the loss from those sacrifices - and the issues definitely deserve attention."
3,gritty and compassionate,"The title whistleblows on the kind of movie it because it surges with America the great in full crusade because we save the world and a sense of moralising ; not that it shouldn't if it wasn't so damn patriotic.There were moments when the whisleblower herself spoilt this film by taking everything too personally and emotionally "" as women do"".Nevertheless the film escaped being corney and hysterical and sentimental and action-packed when usually the great white slave trade gets screen-writers and producers salivating as a juicy theme for an attractive movie. In fact the filming in Serbia seems authentic and it is fascinating to consider it re-enacts true events regarding scandal and cover-up in the UN.I thought it amusing when Vanessa Redgrave made her guest appearance to give a posh British stamp of approval to the film not as well as Dame Judy Drench of course.Overall the film has integrity and good acting and the plot never sagged."
3,The Whistleblower,"An impassioned performance from Rachel Weisz helps to elevate The Whistleblower above standard issue movie trappings. Based upon actual events, it's the tale of Kathryn Bolkovac, a Nebraska policewoman working as an aid worker in Bosnia when she uncovers a brutal human trafficking ring. However, her efforts to report her discoveries are stymied by some of her fellow UN Peacekeepers, and Bolkovac wages a dangerous one-woman campaign to bring the truth to light. Though I found The Whistleblower to be a bit too heavy-handed, the film is a solid throwback to the paranoid political thrillers of the 1970s, as well as a decent primer on an undeniably important issue."
5,Awesome,Well Rachel Weisz is in The movie what more do you need she didn't win an Oscar for nothing. great story line and great cast
3,I went with the stars.....,"We were previewing movies to watch one Saturday evening and came across this one. Since it looked well reviewed and had many stars, we decided to watch it. Unfortunately it wasn't very good. Not terrible, just very predictable."
5,Tells the truth about some segments of the slave/sex trade overseas.,"Based on fact, true story about one Lady's attempt to do what was right, no matter what the consequences were. This courageous Lady defied many of the 'higher ups' in the International Peace Keeping process; where she put her life on the line repeatidly to try to save girls and women enslaved in the sex trade in a war zone.An excellent movie that I highly recommend."
4,Unusual and Well-Done,"An interesting story, very well told and passionately acted by Rachel Weisz. Balance between the business-like police work and the atmosphere of impending menace holds your attention and keeps you guessing. Cameo by Vanessa Redgrave is worth the price of the rental. Highly recommended."
4,THERE IS NO GOING BACK,"Rachel Weisz stars as Kathryn Bolkovac, a Lincoln Nebraska police officer. This is not the savvy Rachel Weisz role we are used to seeing. The beginning of the film tries to dummy down her character. Needing money she accepts a job in Bosnia as an observer, quickly moving up to a position of authority. She uncovers a sex trade scandal which involves the local police as well as her fellow co-workers and several international agencies.Attempting to do the right thing is a challenge especially when the victims fear to cooperate.This is not an exploitation film as the topic might suggest. There are no horrific graphic scenes and the nudity is on Polaroid photos. The script did not build the suspense, drama and excitement as one might expect. The actors were not as convincing as they should have been. Worth a view, but not owning.Parental Guide: F-bomb, sex, nudity."
3,The Whistleblower,"The movie is good but there to much of the dialog in foreign langagues, there are to many different agencies making it difficult to fallow.The movie is worth the purchase."
1,Did not even finish watching......,"Disappointed. I usually like movies based on true stories, but this lost a lot in the way it was produced. Felt it was very slow and then the violence was too disturbing...seemed to be trying to make that the ""entertainment"" ...UGH! We didn't finish watching the movie...didn't want to waste the time."
4,Dimensions and trees,"Trees are super glued on, even though it's not that big of a deal.Dimensions are 17.7"" * 8.7"" * 11.2.Still looks fantastic in my 20 gallon tank."
4,OSI Marine Lab Mountain with Trees Large Aquarium Ornament,I purchased this for my 30 gal. tank & my cichlids love it. They swim in & out & even hang out inside for a while. Best thing I ever purchased for my fish.
3,ok,"its a pretty piece....a little larger than believed.....and a lil more fragile than i would have likes, but still a pretty piece for a tank"
2,Waste of my time,"It was terrible movie as I was expecting good follow up story from City of God. It didnt look real, if you are buying this movie because you saw city of God you gonna be disappointed"
2,Don't visit Brazil !,This movie is like a promotional film on why you don't ever want to visit Brazil. Teenagers with machine guns.
3,A nice conclusion,"City of Men, the film, was a nice conclusion to the brazilian released TV series of the same name. yet, overall i felt it held back on cinematic wonder and on its own failed to intrigue me."
2,Not in the same league as City of God,"I saw (and loved) City of God. What a film!! Great story, awesomely brought to the big screen. Well, this film is not nearly of the same caliber. The pacing is poor, story somewhat clumsily rendered, and all the action takes place right near the end! I cannot give a thumbs up to this film, perhaps if Mierelles had directed rather than executive produced, things might have turned out a whole lot better!"
4,First Book by Clark,It took a lot of reading to get to the twists and turns that made the book well worth reading.
5,Where are the children,"I love Mary Higgins Clark novels, but this one has definitely topped my favorites. Definitely the right amount of creepy!! LOVE IT!!"
1,Book desciption on Amazon is wrong.,"Where are the children? is a great book just like all Mary Higgins Clark books, but the book described in the book description on this page is ""While My Pretty One Sleeps."" If you are looking for the description of Where are the children make sure you do the search inside the book option!!!!!!!"
4,good read,I enjoyed this book. Not a deep thinking book which I enjoy for leisure reading. Finished it quickly bc it was fun to read.
5,Absolutely LOVED it!!!,"This book had me sitting at the edge of my chair. I just could not put it down, I wanted to know what was about to happen next."
3,Works good for the M42 motor except the O-Ring.,"DO NOT use the rubber gasket that comes with this! It will cause you to pull your hair out trying to find the leak! Make sure you purchase the 039-0029 Thermostat Gasket from Beck/Arnley, for the one that comes in the box it too big, and the housing will NOT seat properly. That stupid rubber gasket had me running circles for 2 hours trying to figure out what I did wrong, and why it this thing still leaking coolant.Otherwise it would have gotten 5 stars."
2,Really cheap quality,It was good for 1 month then got bad. Buy oem ones its not worth buying it a few bucks cheaper.
3,Ben,"The Item was in perfect condition, but it did not fit my 2000 BMW 323i it uses a diferent type of thermostat. They posted it would fit 2000 BMW 323i but no. Due to my location, the return cost was too expensive so I made a bad buy because of wrong information posted by them."
1,Check out Futaba before you buy this item,The Spektrum line is cheaply built and is indicative of the kind of company that owns them: Horizon Hobby. The switches all break with minimum use and they are hard to replace. I would recommend looking into other radio manufacturers such as Futaba. These hobby distributors are basically monopolies and make and sell mediocre products due to the fact that they own the market. Futaba is a huge company and makes radios for the military as well as strong commercial radio applications. Support excellence and a free economy!!!
5,Thank You Very Much For A Very Nice Transaction,Thank You very Much For A Very Nice Transaction - The Object Is In Good Condition - Thank You Very Much !
4,worked Okay,"I bought this same model from somewhere else. It didn't come with driver CD. Albeit it worked with Windows XP's generic Driver.I've a large 22 incd LCD monitor and I can control it atleast from 10 foot away. No need to worry about wire stuff.It worked okay for me.This thing has got another buttons too. I'm searching for driver to this no brand model , so as to utilize/program those other idle buttons too."
2,Not for anything over Windows 98,"I have windows vista on my laptop, I thought that this would be compadible with any windows program, come to find out that it is not compadible with anything over windows 98."
1,Huge let down.,I was led to believe that this mouse was going to be capatible with bluetooth and it isn't. I have to constantly sync the mouse with the receiver to get the mouse to connect and work. I should have saved my money and just lived with the generic USB wired mouse that came with my laptop.
1,Crap,"Mouse didn't work out of the box new. It's light, and poorly designed. It's cheap because it won't last long, if it works at all."
2,"wireless rechargeable mouse, NOT FOR Window 98 or above!!","i ordered this wireless mouse for my home computer to get rid of wires and i did exactly what the instructions told me to do. i charged it for the initial 12 hours like suggested, i even loaded the software on my computer, and i even tried replacing the batteries, and nothing, it wouldn't even work, the usb hardware wasn't recognized by my computer. in other words, my OS couldn't recognize the software. i was trying to use it on my desktop which is Windows XP pro, didn't work, i then tried to see if it would work on my laptop which is Windows Vista, and still nothing.if anyone knows a way around this please let me know because i still have the mouse but have been crdited for the purchase as a return. so if you know how to get it to work on Windows Vista/XP let me know. other wise, it is still not worth the purchase."
1,"""Poo"" is a nice way of putting it","Do Not Buy! I advise, no, I command you! The response is terribly slow and the battery life is horrible. I got mad one night and smashed it on my knee...It shattered into 13,769,461,038 pieces. I counted one by one as I threw them into the toilet."
1,Junk,"Never holds a charge thus never works right, thus I am still always without a mouse and having to use alt and ctrl keys to manuver around windows. I still ended up going back and buying a high priced mouse."
4,Works well,"For a no name mouse, this one works pretty well or at least as well as the Logitech mouse it replaced. For those of you complaining about it not holding a charge, it's probably the batteries. If you haven't considered replacing the batteries, maybe wireless technology is a little beyond you."
5,Purr-Fect Faith is an inspiration.,"I have read this book through twice and each time it spoke to my heart at a different spiritual level. Being personally involved in the cat fancy and having experienced similar times when God blessed me through this hobby I found myself indentifying with Laura in so many of her adventures. Purr-Fect Faith is a journey and it's not a journey of just one exhibitor and one cat. It is journey through which all Christians must travel to arrive at perfect faith and perfect trust in our Heavenly Father. I believe it will speak to a wide variety of people, not just to those in the cat fancy.If God will use a hobby like Laura's involvement in the showing Persian cats to advance the kingdom and to grow his followers in the faith, what does he have in store for your life? What hobby, interest, or desire do you have that God wants to use?"
2,Importance doesn't guarantee an interesting read,"Let's be honest. The people represented in these essays were there when the whole revival movement was getting underway. They grunted and sweated and, without them, the music might not be where it is today. I'm sure these guys would be great to share a pitcher with in some dark pub, hearing firsthand some of their stories. It was probably even an interesting series of lectures back in 1991, when the words carried the personality of the people talking. But this book ... frankly, it's perilously close to boring. While it may be an invaluable scholarly resource for someone researching particulars of the folk movement, it can make for dull recreational reading."
2,A very confusing book,"The book the begining place is very confusing and in my opinion not very well written. it changes points of view and has new characters with out any thing indicating it. the characters besides hugh, are not even beliveable characters. the book is not entertaining to read and doesnt even have a plot until about 1\3 of the way through."
5,A CELEBRATION OF GAY LOVE!,"All four stories are great and I have a wonderful time reading them. My favorite is ""Outline of a Torso"". Like one of the reviewers, I wish Schell has extended this unique short story into a novel. Schell has written a gem and one wishes there is more. ""Sugar Daddy Summer"" is commendable and it is worthy of Kenry. Mann is one of my favorite writers and has proved himeself once again with the relatively light hearted ""The Perfect Husband"". I never like Tyler's style but ""Satisfaction"" is a fun read and has less ""Hollywood"" influence which I dread. Do yourself a favor and get this book."
4,Sturdy Design,This sifter is very sturdy and well-made. The sifting handle is smooth and allows whatever items you are sifting to flow through easily - no shaking necessary! This item also cleans up troublefree.
2,poor quality for the companies reputation,This sifter broke a month after I got it. It seems sturdy but it actually requires carefull handling. The sifting is somewhat slow but good (excercise!!!).
4,Sifty sifty,"I've only used this a few times, and I'm quite pleased with its ease of use, the amount of flour that comes through on each squeeze, and the resulting sift. I have heard that some flour can sneak out the bottom by the handle, but I have yet to see this. Once again, I have only used it a few times but so far so good!"
1,"Too much work, didn't last long","The Amco sifter broke during the second time I was using it and the first time I used it it took a long time and the handle kept sticking. Also my hand, wrist and arm were hurting so bad from all the work it took just to get four cups sifted. It also leaks flour where the handle is at the bottom."
3,It was really boring until the end!!!!,It is a Okay movie because it seemed 10000000000 HOURS!!!!!!!
5,Good cable,What is there to say about a cable. It works! I use it to attach a small subwoofer to my digital piano and it works fine!
4,Black and Decker DS700 6volt cordless electric shrubber,"Hey-I have Irish eyes also-and am thankfull that I found this very lite tool. Because I have MS, I still wear out before the shrubber does. It lasts about 1/2 hour and does fine work before having to be recharged. Great buy..."
3,Slow,"Seems nicely made and is easy to handle. However it's slow cutting speed and low power make it a tool only for cutting new soft growth. Even for that application I see it useful only for small jobs.It handles easily and holds a charge for longer than I would want to use it. The small size is an asset. It would be a good addition to a tool set that included a powerful, full size trimmer."
4,Shrubber is Handy Around the Yard,"I bought the B/D Cordless Shrubber early this season and have used it several times. It's easy to use, more convenient than the standard hedge clippers and does a good job on light duty tasks...i.e. new growth. Don't expect it to cut through mature branches. It's great for shapping small ornamentals."
4,Trimmer,"I bought this trimmer to trim up dead flowers. If the stems are larger than the space between the teeth it will not work. But, it works wonderful on small bushes and hedges. I trimmed bushes with ease. I do like it and will keep it."
4,Black and Decker small hedge trimmer,Love this product. Could not find it anywhere.... Home Depot was out of them and EVERY store I contacted did not carry it. This product is light and easy to use... And battery operated.... Worth every penny.
4,What I wanted,This electric shrubber was what I wanted and expected. I would have like the cutting area to be just a little longer. It is very convenient though and the charge life is about all the time I want to be shrubbing.
3,Love it......BUT.....,"This is a great little product, just like the model I had to trash. Mechanically, the old one was working fine. It's just that the battery finally gave out after several years of use. I recycled the battery, but can't help but wonder why B&D can't make one with a replaceable rechargeable battery. It's irresponsible of ALL companies who make products which are added to our landfills solely because the batteries were not replaceable. Hence, the 3 stars instead of 5."
3,"Good , but over priced",A useful tool but I think is a little high on the price.The battery needs some improvement in terms of the the running time per charge.
3,Satisfactory but that's about it,"1. I'm quite satisfied with how long a battery charge lasts.2. An inconvenience is that there is no way to lock the trigger in the ""on"" position.3. You have to grab the end of anything larger than a twig which goes against keeping your hands away from the blades.4. Depending on your needs, consider buying something a little more powerful."
4,Adequate to the task,"I liked this product, as I do most Black and Decker products. It's very small, but extremely sturdy. It isn't meant for everything. If you have a small yard and not a lot of bushes, it's for you. You can't beat the value.Black and Decker can improve this product by including a short booklet on how to cut different kinds of shrubs, or having a link to a website that does that. There are some types of shrubs and bushes this doesn't work with."
5,Review from a daughter ;),OMG!!! I fell in love with this musical after I played a Bird Girl in December... I'm still humming the music!! Buying this book is like buying a Seussical user's guide! Buy. This. Book.
4,Seussical,"This is a wonderful musical, with lots of very fun and catchy music. I own this piano book, but am a little disappointed that more songs were not included. Seussical has SO many songs, and there are only 13 in this book. Many other piano books for musicals include ALL the songs in the show, so this is a bit of a disappointment."
5,Last two movements really shine,"Bruckner is not one of my favorite composers but his 4th, 7th and 9th symphonies are among my all time favorites. And the 7th is the very best of all. It has been my impression that many Bruckner 7 performances lose momentum after the slow movement. At over 40 minutes, the first two movements are longer than most symphonies in their entirety. Therefore it is not surprising that performances fizzle in the scherzo and finale. But in this recording, the performance actually gains momentum and comes to a thrilling conclusion. The brass playing here is simply the finest I have ever heard in any Bruckner performance. I had no idea the Scottish orchestra had such great brass players. And although this is a studio recording, it has all the passion and vitality of a live concert performance. If you are thinking about taking a chance on Bruckner, this is the recording to buy."
4,"Good book, quick read","I read this for my ""Immigrant Experience"" class, and it was very good. The characters were believable and the writer thoroughly portrayed their emotions. I read this book in one sitting because it was also very entertaining, but a little on the ""down"" side."
3,ok,"it was ok, not so exciting but neither boring. I bought this book for my English class and it helps me writing the essay."
3,I EXPECTED MORE,"i anticipated to buy this book for a while since it is so hard now and days to find books by and/or about filipino americans such as myself. when i got the book i opened it and started to read. when i was finished with the book i was sorry to say that i expected more. it wasnt much like a filipino american family, but like a filipino american family who was embarrased of their heratage and backround. just a couple of teenage boys who were afraid to say, ""yes, i am filipino."" but rather try to pull of the mexican/gringo look. there were some nice traits of a typical filipino family, but it wasnt enough for me. over all it was a good story, nice base lines and plot. but not what i expected."
2,"Good in places, bad in others","The book had a promising premise: gang life for two boys in a marginal neighborhood trying to forge their own identities in the face of a world that shows them contempt.But this premise fell flat. There were several sections that were good, such as the sections where Tomas trains the dogs and when Gabe runs away. But I thought neither of the boys were completely developed as characters. There were several elements that I thought were left out: any sort of romantic life for the younger brother, thoughts about their father who abandoned them, and any interactions among Tomas, Gabe and any of those who were in Tomas' gang. These seemed like odd omissions, and therefore the book was strong in places and weak in others.One nitpicky detail: there were several items about Los Angeles that the book got wrong, e.g. calling Abbott Kinney Boulevard Abbott Kenny Street."
5,Book was in excellent condition as promised.,"Book was in excellent condition as promised. The book was delayed a bit, but the seller informed me of the delay and send my book when promised."
5,"FIRST APPEARENCE OF ""THE SMALLEST DRAGONBOY"" BY ANNE McCAFFREY!","THIS is a 1973 CLASSIC! This is a collection that Roger Elwood supervised. Not ONLY is it the first appearance of the afore mentioned ""THE SMALLEST DRAGONBOY"", but it also contains an introduction by Theodore Sturgeon. The other authors represented in this book are :"" Arthur Tofte, Claire Edwin Street, David H. Charney, Raymond F. Jones, Nick Boles and Terry & Carol Carr"".Yes, this was aimed at teen-preteen readers. However this does not matter. Reading this is like visiting a time capsule of these writers. One more detail, the fascinating illustrations(look at that cover!) are by ""Rod Ruth"". A GEM OF THE 1970'S!"
1,No hits..........,"The order originally said it would ship in 10 days. After a month, never came!! I was given a choice of a refund or to reship. I chose reship and was notified a week later they were out. Still, I had to pay my bill and now I will be waiing for my credit. Best to stick to domestic companies."
5,I really liked the CD. I think they should make other songs,"I thunk all the boys in imajin are cute. Especially Olamide no offense to John,Talib,& Jamal. I like all the snippets on there tape I have all there tapes there all so good especially No Doudt I LOVE YOU GUYS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Must See Doc about Stan Lee,"Not being a huge comic book fan, I came to this movie through all of the hype about The Avengers. Stan Lee is sooo cool. I feel like I will enjoy the movies more now that I have insight into who their creator is. Charming, smart, witty and lover of a great story. Stan Lee became more that just the guy in the cameos in the films. With Great Power gives you the insider scoop on how the characters were created. I highly highly recommend!"
4,MY GRADE: B to B plus.,"This documentary follows the life of Stan Lee who claims he stumbled into comics and then turned out to love it so much he never wants to retire from the activity. There's a lot of details about his struggling life, working with artists, how famous Marvel characters came to be and especially when he almost walked away for good from comics (when the comic industry took a number of economic and social hits). In the background and foreground is his wife of 40 years who helped him go during the dark times and was always there to amp his mood up and inspire him to keep going.Overall a fun documentary and a must for Stan Lee/Marvel fans.MY GRADE: B to B plus; WHEN WATCHED: mid December 2012 (streamed);"
3,Moves nicely done but not put together,"Each movement is nicely done, but you have to do a mirror image of it. There was a tv instructor who did the mirror image herself so you just copied her exactly and that made it simple. Also, though the moves are great, there isn't any real putting together of the individual moves so you do need other instruction."
4,Excellent for beginners,"Simply, this is a very good place for beginners to start. With all of the different tapes, forms and variations of forms available it can be confusing for beginners (like myself). From scratch I learned the form presented in about a month. However, some very important facts were not explained like: What form is taught on the tape? Is the set presented only one segment of the Yang long form? The title is Tai Chi for Health Vol. 1 In order to learn the complete form I'm guessing you need the other Vols. Where can they be found?"
2,..disappointed..,"Upon inital use of this tape, I felt that it could have gone to a more advanced level. Although it does an adequate job of reviewing basic postures. What is lacking is a thorough workout so that a user will want to use this tape as a guide on a regular basis. Great for beginners but no more."
5,An extremely useful video for the beginner.,"I have always been interested in Tai Chi but have been intimidated by the apparent complexity of the movements. This video presents the different forms in a carefully segmented format which allows you to learn and practice a few movements at a time. I loved the instant gratification of having a few moves to practice and being able to add more as I felt comfortable. Thanks to this video, I'm hooked on Tai Chi!"
2,Pass,"I thought these were pretty good when I first got them - but that was upgrading from iPod headphones.If you're willing to drop $150 for a set of cans, look into Grado. I have a pair of SR125's now and Triports aren't even close."
2,VERY fragile,"I've owned these headphones for a while and every couple months they break. It's the headband that is so poorly manufactured, as the plastic snaps very easily, making them virtually unusable. Right now there are three places being held together by superglue, and these breaks weren't caused by dropping the headphones, it was regular use, putting them on and taking them off, that wore out the plastic.They sound good, which for $150 they should. I'm going to get a pair of Sennheiser HD201's for about a fifth the price if these break again."
3,"Love 'em, but they break","These headphones sound really good.But I've had 2 pairs -- each broke in the same way. The plastic arm holding the headphone cup broke despite careful use. Bose was good enough to replace them both time, but I had to pay for shipping. And that's 2 weeks without them each time they broke.If I had it to do over, I'd get something that wasn't so fragile."
2,Over-priced,"Bose is able to mass-market and heavily advertise their products, while superior headphone companies (e.g., Beyerdynamic, AKG, Sennheiser, and Grado) do not have that luxury. This means that Bose can get away with selling a $50 product for three times that amount. It's probably worthy of 3 stars if it were sold much cheaper, but I have to take off a star for price inflation.The best thing to do for people on a $100-150 budget for quality headphones is to shop around, and defintiely to check out forums like Head-Fi.org where users share their views."
1,Kick yourself for not knowing better,"These are the hype of headphones you are so excited to get home and see what the $$ gets you and when you plug in... let down to say the least! It's all about bang for buck folks, these things should be priced at about $79 with the over pronounced bass, muddy mids, and shrill highs.Take a look at Sennheiser HD580 or for something sealed the Beyerdynamic DT 250-250 for a few bucks more will really dazzle. If you are serious about your sound Buy Other Sound Equipment (pun intended)"
1,You must be kidding,"I've heard quite a few good headphones, Grado 125, Sennheiser 580, Beyerdynamic 770, Audio-Technica a900, AKG k271, the list goes on, and I've got to say the Triport is one of the worst vales in the audio industry. $150 for bloated one note midbass that doesn't extend very far at all, piercing grainy treble that doesn't extend and a scooped out midrange that obscures details. I swear the frequency curve on this thing must look like an M.The Triport's tendency to break is well known, leaving them little more that expensive bolos.If it cost $40, it may be a decent deal, but I wouldn't buy it. I'd either get the Sennheiser hd-280 for $90 or the $30 koss ksc-35, both are better deals and sound much better IMO."
3,Great sound Cheap Quality,I love the sound of the tri-port by Bose but they broke the first night I used them. I fall asleep wearing them on board ship and they keep breaking. Cheap plastic lightweight construction. Super glue and tape required if you buy these.
3,Broke... eventually,"My pair of beloved Triports broke on the headband while putting them on after about a year and a half. They sounded great, and were incredibly light and comfortable; as someone who wears glasses, this is a tall order for most headphones.Despite my attachment, I've come to realize that they are overpriced and fairly cheaply made. If only the build quality were up to task, as I can't imagine these cost more than a pair of cheapos to make. I'll be replacing them with a pair of equally expensive Sennheisers, having been perilously introduced to the world of high quality headphones.Bose, you have my money, but I'm going to stay away from you in the future."
2,"Great sound, fragile","I loved my Triports for about year, when they developed a short near the plug that quickly worsened until they became unusable. When I bought them new they were $180. A year of normal use is pretty darned shabby for almost two hundred bucks."
2,Way Too Flimsy!!!,Bought this product about 1 year ago. The head band is a very thin flimsy plastic that will break as a result of normal usage. Mine broke one day as I was taking it off. Buyer Beware!
3,"good sound, bad construction","i enjoy the sound these headphones give, but they are very fragile and have broken in several places, just from general use, fortunately not around the earpiece but i would still expect better for my money."
4,Comments on the Triports - windy conditions & headband,"The sound of the TriPorts is excellent. Nice clean bass. I traded in Bose QC2's for this model, since the QC2's are always powered and I heard hiss between passages. Since this unit is a passive device, no such problem.After one year, the headband broke and Bose replaced it. It was not as durable as I would have liked to see. Also, when used outside in breezes greater than about 10 mph, the wind rushes past the open port holes in the earcups and generates an annoying sound like ""wind blowing across a microphone"". These headphones are not too good for outdoor use when there is wind.When I traded in my headphones, I was told by Bose that the Blue color was being phased out in favor of Silver. Silver is so visible that the headphones attract too much attention, so I prefer the Blue color."
2,OVERPRICED...,"as all Bose products are. They do an excellent job of marketing, they hang a high price on he very average electronic products. comparable brands sell less than half the $$$. Heard these phone with an ipod over x-mas, I'm AM an audiofile, sound OK... should sound AMAZING at $140."
5,different color,"just got my BOSE Triport Headphone today, it's awesome, but the product i received is a different color than the one in the picture. i got silver, not ""dark grey"" as shown in the pic."
1,Great sound...HORRIBLE Quality,"I got these as a gift, so thankfully I did not spend the money on these things. Yes, Bose sound quality is great, and they were very good in this capacity.But read the other reviews, after about a month, the plastic broke. I had another friend who had them and his broke before mine, so I was particularly careful when handling them once I found out. Didn't matter. The plastic where you can adjust the headphones breaks quickly. Then the earpieces eventually fall off.Seriously, if you are going to buy expensive headphones, do not buy these. it's a shame they break because the sound quality was good."
1,"BOSE, terrible products for a lot of your money","The Bose Triport Headphones are very fragile, like many have already said. A Bose employee at one of their stores actually told me that the little plastic tabs that hold the headband in place are supposed to break after normal use.BOSE is a company that thrives off of great marketing and poor products. They are unwilling to replace your products, but they'll gladly knock off half of the price for an upgrade! (They still make a ridiculous profit.)"
3,"Pricey, but nice","I've had my headphones for a little over a year and have been pretty satisfied with them. Yes, since they're Bose, you're gonna pay more, just like any other name brand. However, I've learned that their customer service is fantastic, unlike most other companies. I learned the hard way that these headphones are fragile - my earpiece recently broke. So I went to the Bose website to complain, and rather than a brush off email, they offered to exchange them for free. So yeah, I was a little disappointed how fragile they are, but very satisfied with their response. I would recommend getting something other than the bag they provide as a carrying case - like a hard cover."
2,Sony MDR 7506 vs. Bose Triport,"We just did a side-by-side comparison of these and a pair of Sony Pro MDR-7506 Headphones. We swapped them back and forth on the same jack on the same PC playing the same music using iTunes.The Sony MDR 7506's, being studio monitor quality, are without any doubt MUCH clearer at all frequencies and make you sound like you are there, while the Bose Triports were muddy and distant. The Sony MDR 7506's are less expensive as well. The triports are just a bit lighter, smaller and have a thinner cord, which you may find useful for mobile use. My choice between the two for serious listening would be the Sony MDR 7506. If you are an audiophile, you will immediately notice the difference and will want the Sony Pro MDR-7506 Headphones.Thanks,Carl"
2,"Poor Construction, Limited Fidelity","At the price and promotion of these phones, much is left to be desired. Output is weak and limited. Modrate range only can be achieved via and EQ or Amplifier. Best suited for home audio, not for portables.Construction is light, weak and flimsy. Actually, the poorest build I've seen at this price.The dynamic range of this unit is easily matched by most Koss units. A watch-sign is how Bose doesn't disclose this unit's Ohmage, range or diaphragm set-up, in package or at the official site.Will use them while they hold together, not much choice.Not at all recommended. The noise cancelling model is great for flights but, still the same problems.A real disappointment, especially from Bose."
3,Not worth the price,"I've had these phones a couple of years. Now, the left earcup doesn't produce any sound. When they worked, the sound wasn't all that inspiring and bass was very disappointing. The most I can say about these is that they were the most comfortable headphones I've ever used. They are very lightweight and especially nice fitting for women or those with smaller heads. I have replaced them with the Audio-Technica ATH-M50's and there's just no comparison. The AT's are the finest sounding headphones I've ever worn."
2,Disappointed,I got a set of Bose Triport headphones for Christmas. I use them just when I am sitting in my chair. I use earbuds when I am walking. The Triport headphones are very light in weight and also seem to be light in quality. The coverings over the foam cushions came apart at the seams and are just flapping in the breeze. I talked with Bose and I thought they should replace the cushions but all they would do is tell me I could purchase some new cushions. I was deeply disappointed in the quality of construction and in their lack of concern for their defective product.
5,Great Sound!,I bought these for my husband for Christmas. The sound is awesome! They are very comfortable to wear too. I am concerned about the other customer's words of warning regarding the fragility...it's only been three weeks of use but so far so good!
5,Get bose.,"Shopped around in Best Buy for headphones before purchasing these off Amazon. I had returned two different headphones by sony before spending a little more on these""used"" ones. They are practically new and arrived in a just a few days. THANKS AMAZON!"
1,Please don't fall for the hype.,"These would not be bad if the cost around $20.00. But since they don't, spend you money on Sennheisers. They are much better and better priced. Bose is one example that you don't get what you pay for."
3,"Ok headphones, but shop around for other brands","These are ok headphones, but if you shop around you may find a better set made by someone else. I've had my pair for a couple of years, and they've done ok up to now. Only thing is they are a bit flimsy, I've had part of the plastic on the head arch break. It's taped, but still a bit of a nuisance."
3,"Good, but Fragile","Pros:1. Possibly the best sounding pair on the market.2. Long cable.Cons:1. Fragile (Do not think you can toss these in your luggage, will break easily)."
3,Great Sound Quality but...,"There is no doubt that the sound quality of these haedphones is great. But after about a year of daily use the wires on my pair have become frayed at both ears and at the jack, and they have quit working. I have searched for a place to repair them both online and locally, to no avail. And at 150 bucks a pop I doubt that I will purchase another pair."
2,"Not worth it, Fragile","A few notes:Sound quality is good. But not $125 good. Like all Bose products Ive heard: best of the mainstream but not close to more niche products.Construction is terrible. Almost everything that could break on these has: both cans have come off the headband (taped back on), both foams have peeled black pleather onto everything I own, and also are tearing away from the cup. It's pretty remarkable how symmetric the damage is, but that just speaks to the low quality- they will wear out.Overall, I wouldn't buy these again. There are too many cheaper and better options. Try Grado Sr-60's, which will perform just as well or better for a lot less."
1,Get the Sony MDR-7506,"After two years of use I just gave up. They are very fragile and break easily. I am surprised that no one has mentioned that you can hurt yourself when they snap. I have gone through two pairs. I now have the Sony MDR-7506. It puts rings around the Bose. Bose products, in general, have gone downhill. A year ago I bought a pair of Bose speakers for $99. When I opened the box I discovered that the speakers did not have an on/off switch. After about three months I started to hear a hum coming from the speakers even when the volume was at zero. And guess what? You can't turn off the set."
1,Really don't waste your time,"I've owned 2 pairs of these so far. They sound great and are very comfortable on your ears. They're very light weight. There's not much noise pollution from them so the person in the next cube can't hear your music. Also, external noise has to be pretty loud to be heard over the music.The design is horrible, though! These things 100% will break on you after about 1-2 years of light use. Believe me when I say that I do not treat these headphones rough. They sit in my cubicle at work and don't travel more than a few feet per day and are locked up when I'm not there. I slide them off of my head when I put them on and take them off instead of pulling them outwards. I do anything and everything to lessen the stress on the bands. Despite all of my precautions, they still break! No I don't have a big head! Thank goodness for replacement plans. I don't think I will be going with this brand again."
4,Bose gets unfair reviews,"Many people think that just because it's Bose it's crap. It's not true, in fact, all headphones are good based merely on subjectivity. However, I own these cans, and I think they sound great. They are fragile, but with a small amount of vinyl tape I have kept them together. I don't know if it was worth $150, but they're the best headphones I've ever worn, not to mention the most comfortable.Senn/Grado doesn't get as much marketing, but I would say that the Senn PX100 are comparable to these (but too small for me)."
1,Fragile and Overpriced,"As soon as you pick up these headphones, you will realize that they were a mistake. They have the structural Integrity you would expect from a $5 pair of Headphones. The cups are awkwardly sized to the point where they do not seal large ears and put pressure on small ears. Their sound quality is comparable to Grado/Sennheiser/Beyer phones in the $50 range, not the $150 range. In the $150 range, you have MANY better choices. Avoid these phones like the plague."
1,Not a bad can - if it was 50 bucks.,"But for 150 there are way too many other better cans, as previously suggested. In fact, there are better cans at 50 bucks too lol!"
2,"Good headphone, but poor build quality",I bought this headphone with my Ipod. It was so comfortable at first. But the arms broke in just 1 month by normally use....
2,"Way, way overpriced!","I took my trusty old Sennheisers with me when I tried out these in a shop, and guess what? No contest: Sennheiser DESTROYS Bose in a nanosecond! Much more natural sound, none of the exaggerated highs, boomy lows and empty mids...thank God I tried before buying!Granted, the Bose sound better than my $20 Sonys I use for jogging, but you can get the Sennheisers for less money to enjoy much better sound."
2,"great sound, horrid construction","These headphone give great response at low to moderate levels. At higher levels you easily get distortion not found in other higher-end headsets. These lack any really good resistence. I can easily get sound distortion with my iRiver.The build construction is horrid. The cups are nice and comfortable for many hours of wear but the plastic used on the rails and D-Ring is garbage. I use these at work (a desk job) and I'm already on my third pair (the first two were replaced under warranty) and these are starting to crack and break. If you plan to use your headphones every day, don't expect these to last more than a year before the plastic starts to crack or break."
3,"OK, but overpriced.","I evaluated these in a direct comparison to Sony MDR-V600s, and I decided that these are overpriced. The V600s are less money, and the sound quality is better (in my opinion). One good thing about the Bose TriPort is: they are really comfortable. Not more comfortable than the V600s, but one of the only pairs I tried that fit me as well as the V600s.The sound quality on these is good for bass-hounds, bad for people who want flat audio reproduction. The manufacturing quality is poor. They really do seem frail, and they don't look particularly impressive."
1,"poor quality, typically horrible bose sound","These headphones are poorly constructed and offer poor sound across the frequency spectrum. The bass is flabby and distorted, mids don't exist, and highs are rolled off for a terrible overall sound. Several other alternatives have been suggested but if you're going to spend $150 on headphones, look at the Sennheiser HD280 Pro or Sony MDR-V7506 for much better sound"
3,its just ok,"positives:- extremely light and comfortable- good (but exaggerated) bass, full soundnegatives;- fragile construction- overpriced for its mid-fi sound- in windy places, all you hear is the wind and nothing else.- sound is tailored for music with bass-emphasis. Far from neutral or balanced.These are pretty good headphones as a 3rd or 4th pair, but if you're looking for your 1st high-quality headphones, I suggest getting the Sennheiser HD580 or AKG K501. They sound much, much better for the same price."
2,Bose Triport Headphone,"I bought these headphones for about $100 & the sound & comfort was excellent. Lightweight was a plus. However, the plastic piece on the adjuster ends of the headphones broke within 1 year. Both sides broke on separate occasions, which leads me to believe that it is a defective design. This was not due to misuse as I am very careful with my electronic equipment & only used these at home with my PC. It is simply a design flaw & I was disappointed based on Bose's reputation for quality. Bose needs to fix this problem to make this a truly exceptional headphone."
1,Spend your money elsewhere,"Out of curiosity and because of all the great reviews on here, I bought a pair of these headphones only to be hugely disappointed. Knowing that headphones and speakers need some time to break in before they get to their optimal sound, I kept them around hoping that the sound would get better. After a few more weeks of listening, they didn't get any better and when compared to my cheapie Koss KSC75 headphones, the Triports didn't do too well. The Koss was a better overall listening experience and made the Triports sound lifeless. This fact was made even worse by the fact that the KSC75 only cost $20. This infuriated me since I had just paid $150 for something that didn't sound as good as a $20 set of headphones and on top of that, the headband just broke! I now wish that I had taken the time to read the reviews here about their bad build quality and poor sound."
3,ultra fragile,These headphones sound great as others have testified but they are incredibly fragile.The headband on my pair broke 4 times in the first year!In fairness to Bose they did give me a full refund.
1,Never received it,"I tried getting in contact with the dealer on two occasions but never got a response back. This product was a gift for my dude. He nor I never got the opportunity to use it so I could not tell you how it was. I heard it was good though but would love to have had it to try it. When ordering, just make sure that they ACTUALLY have the item IN STOCK. It said it was in stock but was told VERY recent that they didn't have it. Go figure. I'm sure others enjoy this product but once again, I wanted to try it on his hair. Happy shopping people. Peace."
4,Her most comprehensive collection...,"This is a fantastic collection of Dionne Warwick's songs from 1962-1971, showcasing not only her distinct voice, but also the creative collaborations of Burt Bacharach and Hal David. The CD illustrates the tremendous bond that lied between Warwick's vocal styling, and Bacharach and David's songs. The highlights include ""Don't Make Me Over,"" ""Anyone Who Had A Heart,"" ""Walk On By,"" and ""I Say A Little Prayer."" The album is quite lengthy (24 tracks), including a few mediocre numbers here and there. That's why it earns four stars, rather than five. However, the album is a perfect illustration of a matching of a great voice with great music. This album is an excellent introduction for the younger generations who might have only been exposed to her sub-par eighties work. This album is essential to any collection of sixties music, as well as any collection of popular music."
2,Poor sound quality but great songs!,Needs remixing badly. Great songs but poor sound. I wish someone had informed me of this before I bought this CD. Surely the sound can be improved.
4,"A Comprehensive Collection, But Not Digitally Remastered","This CD is a 24 track, 73 minute, compilation of Dionne Warwick's all-time greatest hits, including the very memorable 'Walk On By' and many, many more...You may be disappointed to find that the music here was not digitally remastered and the analog recordings not up to your usual expectation of the playback quality you've come to take for granted in the digital age...Still, this showcase of Dionne's highly extraordinary and prodigious talent is a very worthwhile investment for any serious collection of music...Highly recommended despite the recording quality."
3,IT IS OKAY,"THIS CD HAD MORE SONGS THAT I HAD NOT HEARD THAN THE ONES I WAS FAMILIAR WITH. IT'S A GOOD CD FOR DIE HARD DIONNE FANS, NOT JUST ONES THAT LIKE A FEW OF HER SONGS."
3,The material is uneven but Warwick is brilliant throughout,"Some of this is brilliant, and a lot of it is dreck. The worst tracks tend to be the most obscure tracks, so you might prefer a more compact Dionne Warwick compilation. Brilliant: ""Anyone Who Had a Heart"", ""Walk on By"", ""Alfie"", ""Do You Know the Way to San Jose?"" (kitchen sink orchestration half-way through excepted). Dionne Warwick is a tasteful, imaginative singer comfortable and convincing in a wide range of styles. Her performance of ""Windows of the World"" is much better than the song itself. On the other hand, Burt Bacharach's and Hal David's work, while almost as stylistically diverse, is very uneven artistically. Some of it is inspired, some of it is humdrum and boring, some of it is shlocky.Also recommended: PENTATONIC SCALES FOR THE JAZZ-ROCK KEYBOARDIST by Jeff Burns."
1,VERY POOR- VERY VERY POOR,"Ms. Warwick's voice is annoying and extremely off-key. It is amazing that music so poor would be on a ""Greatest Hits"" disc (one would wonder what the ""non-greatest"" sounds like). Popular music would have been much better off had Ms. Warwick chosen not to make this music. ""Walk on By"" is an over-rated pop song that deserves a better vocalist. ""Windows of the World"" is pitiful. ""The Empty Place"" is uneven and indeed empty- very poor. One might think that this music was better in its place and time but in fact it wasn't- this music was bad then and it is bad now. If someone offers it to you for free- run away as fast as you can.."
5,Music that wafted down from Heaven,"Since Dionne Warwick found it necessary to consult psychics later in her career, how I wish she had done it much earlier! Perhaps one of those fortune tellers -- if they had been worth their money -- would have told her to NEVER leave the tunesmith team of Bacharach & David!! With their compositions and her voice, the last great chapter of the American Popular Songbook was written. The sophistication, expression, and downright aching that many of these songs exude is undeniable. 'Anyone Who Had a Heart,' for example, drips with such poignancy that it'll stop you dead in your tracks. And that goes for most tunes on this cd. Thank God that Warwick, Bacharach, and David got together to create such wonderful, sublime music!"
5,Soft velvet,"I remember when, years and years ago, the melody of ""Anyone who had a heart"" was flowing through the Summer, infusing something like a sort of reliance in the future and in the affections.Dionne Warwick !A very hard second name which sounds like the sliding of a chain.But the first name is the winding of a velvet, the same velvet which is found in her voice.In Dionne Warwick's ""HER ALL-TIME GREATEST HITS"" welisten to 24 windings of warm, sensual, caressing velvets rich in ""nuances"", in reflections, in shadesand in half-tones jazz and pops.In today's music often overgrown with weeds, class and distinction of an artist like Dionne Warwick are precious flowers."
4,Great reference,I really like this book. The charts are done in black and white symbols and are really attractive. There are some smaller charts for round robins and bigger ones for challenges.
2,Disappointing but watchable Spencer/Hill opus.,"This is no ""Crime Busters!"" It does have some points of interest--the stars in disguise, Spencer dating a weightlifting woman, some minor fight scenes--but the film is really bogged down, in comedy terms, by taking its detective theme seriously but inoccuously. The result is that the film is not very interesting, overall. It will mainly be for Spencer/Hill completists, on the virtue of the few scenes mentioned above. Unfortunately, the stars are starting to show their age here, and their roles are far less physical and lively than in the past."
1,Highly disappointed!,"I received vol. 1 and 2 today, and gee! what a disappointement, these are tracks from cd's andnot live BBC material. Then why did they need to put the BBC logo on it? To make peoplebelieve these are rare tracks? These are live tracks?They did it to make you pay 23.50$ (!!!) or 12 UKP in the UK for a sampler that should cost 5 UKP, or just given freewhen you order two cd's, or something like that. I have all these cd's (almost) so they are goingback today to Amazon.Highly disappointed! Shame on you Grapevine!"
5,Why Churches Die (Diagnosing Lethal Poisons in the Body of Christ,"I thought this book was excellent! On a scale of 1 - 10, I gave this book a 12. I experienced a wide range of emotions while reading this book. I laughted out loud and also cried. The authors have captured the true essence of the diseases that can invade our hearts and minds. This book is an asset to those in church leadership as well as those in the pews. If you obtain a real understanding of the information presented in these pages, you will become a better person."
4,The sickness in today's Christendom,"The authors are well experienced to write about this subject with 25 years of small and large church Pastoring behind them.Easily read, entertaining but pointed.Perhaps best for Church members concerned about the impotence of Christianity today - the Pastors of these Churches are either well aware of their problems, or are blind to them - one of the major reasons why Christianity has little strength."
5,Great Price,"I spend a lot of time at Office Depot, Office Max, and Staples looking for things that I want to buy. When I find something that I want, I take down the name of the product, and buy a similar product on Amazon. I do this because I like to see what I'm buying before I buy it, and Amazon offers lower prices than the stores.Case in point, a similar item sells for $20 at Office Max and $30 at Staples, sells for $6 on Amazon.The USB to PS/2 converter works like a charm for my Microsoft Ergonomic PS/2 Keyboard. I don't have any problems with it. I have a Compaq laptop that runs on Windows Vista Business."
2,HP Pavillion laptop won't boot!,"MY HP Pavillion laptop won't boot with this plugged into any USB port. Once it boots, however, I can use my PS/2 keyboard via this splitter cable. Sabrent has non-existent tech support. One response after 4 email was ""Does it work on another PC?""."
2,fair,"I bought this because it specifically says 'converter', but it's just an adapter and won't work for what I need."
1,worthless,"I was so excited about this product, but it didn't do anything. My computer (Windows XP Home operating system) couldn't recognize the device. It was as if a driver was missing, but there wasn't any indication of how to get one. I poked arougd the Abrent website a bit and it wasn't helpful. Rather than mess around with product support, I decided to just return the thing. My Logitech mouse and old keyboard work fine with another adapter I have, and my computer didin't recognize this thing no matter what I had plugged in (including nothing), so the problem was with this splitter."
1,did not work,"I have a new laptop but it would not recognize this cable, it will not work at all and does not come with a driver."
2,Can't handle more than two keys at at time.,"While the product appears to work at a basic level, it cannot support more than two key presses at once. This makes it USELESS for many game and other specialized applications. I don't mind that the product has this limit, I mind that this limit was not clearly mentioned."
3,Doesn't work with IOGEAR KVM switch,"I bought this to work with the IOGEAR KVM switchIOGEAR GCS62 MiniView Micro KVM Switch. Basically, they are incompatible. The shift key quits sometimes and the delete key may delete 10-20 emails when I press it once! The Sabrent product does seem to work fine without the KVM switch. Buy an adapter from the KVM switch vendor if using a KVM."
1,did NOT work ... first time,"My laptop (Dell Latitude D500) recognized and installed this device but in 30 sec. the device stopped respond.The cable looks VERY cheap...........Next day before returning the item I decided to check it one more time ... and it worked!Checked the device with other machines - everything is fine. VERY, VERY strange..."
5,Has worked perfectly for us so far,"I know other people have had problems, but it has worked perfectly for us so far."
2,"Worked Well, Until it Died","This was very handy to use a wired ps/2 mouse and keyboard to the PS3, but after a few months of use, it doesn't seem to work: the keyboard no longer seems to be on, the lights won't go on with the caps/num lock/scroll lock, and not even the mouse does anything. Tried with various keyboards/mice but it's this product that no longer functions. Buy a USB keyboard instead."
5,"Works Great, even with my mac","This works as expected on my Windows XP Pro machine and also my mac (10.4/Tiger) (No drivers necessary; just plug it in). An added feature is that there is a little LED light that comes on when the USB end is connected to your computer.One thing to note: You must plug in the keyboard/mouse BEFORE you plug in the USB connector to your computer (at least, I had to do this)."
1,Doesn't Work Well,"This product should be better tested. It's keyboard connection is annoying slow (keystrokes are frequently misses, I have have to re-type the same key up to 4 times). I do not recommend it at all."
2,sort of works,"it works, but a few times a day i actually have to unplug it and plug it back in because one or more of the keys doesn't work- once i do the unplug/plug thing they keys will work again."
4,Works (for a while) and it's less expensive than a new keyboard,"I liked my old PS/2 keyboard, but it wouldn't connect to my desktop-replacement 17"" Dell laptop. So I turned to this adapter cable. I only needed one of the PS/2 connections. Good thing, because the other one is evidently not working properly. It works ok at first and then at least one key (not always the same one) will fail to work until the keyboard is disconnected then reconnected. Short story is that it got the job done less expensively than a new keyboard.Update: Late October, 2008 - My keyboard stopped working. I haven't done extensive testing, but my assumption is that this adapter has completely failed. I ended up getting a new native usb keyboard. If I had the opportunity to change my star rating it would be max of 2 stars."
4,Cheap and gets the job done,There aren't a lot of ps/2 splitters out there. This one will get the job done and it's hard to beat the price.My only complaint is that it looks a bit ugly.
1,Total Failure,"I bought six of these to connect USB only systems to my PS2 KVM but not a single one worked. One was DOA, two were physically broken (USB port pulled out of the device when removing its cap), and the other three made my cursor jump all of the screen and type random things when moving the mouse. Thought I'd give these a try because they are Amazon Prime but that didn't work out so well. I'll be sticking to Bytecc BT-2000 adaptors from now on. The Bytecc adaptors have worked 100% of the time even in the craziest situations."
2,Died quickly,"I bought this cable to use with my older KVM switch that only has PS/2 cables. It didn't work properly at first, I had to unplug it and plug it back in for the mouse/keyboard to be recognized after switching between computers. It stopped working completely after about a week of use."
4,It's a really good needle.,"Those who aren't into hi fi will probably balk at the price. Those who are will be surprised by what they get for the price -- this thing's a bargain! It's not going to make your table look amazing but it will make it sound amazing, and for tables with finicky compliance needs (like my PL-518) it's just a dream come true.I regularly pull dirty old records out of the $3 bin, clean them off, CAREFULLY clean the stylus -- and find that the signal is clear, warm, static free and highly enjoyable. It's been going strong for two years and when it finally breaks down, I'll be replacing with another AT440MLA.Honestly this thing has probably saved me a fortune, because it makes my table sound good enough to keep it off the upgrade list, and on a number of occasions it's saved me from having to seek out better quality vinyl."
5,"Unreal value, unreal sound","Like an earlier reviewer, I put this cartridge on a Rega P2. The improvement over the stock Bias 2 cartridge is unbelievable. It tracks so much better (especially on inner grooves and ""problem records"" such as Cemetery Gates by The Smiths) and brings out a brightness that I did not think my system was capable of delivering. I was set up to sell my Bias 2 to a friend, but after listening to my A/TAT440MLa he's buying one of his own-I can't fault him. It's a great cartridge. I've only had a couple cartridges before, and this is just the second one I've paired with my P2, but I can't imagine a better fit for the deck at this price. It's a total steal."
4,I love this cartridge after only a few minutes of play time,"Okay, so I just installed this cartridge on myDenon DP-300F Fully Automatic Analog Turntable. I had been using aShure M97xE High-Performance Magnetic Phono Cartridgewhich I was very happy with, but wanted to try something else, so I decided to give this cartridge a try. I'm using the stock head shell that came with theDenon DP-300F Fully Automatic Analog Turntable. Anyway after just a few minutes I could tell a difference with this cartridge. I like how it sounds better than theShure M97xE High-Performance Magnetic Phono Cartridgebut of course its almost twice the price, so in that regard it should be better. I'll soon be trying this cartridge and theShure M97xE High-Performance Magnetic Phono Cartridgeon anAudio Technica AT-LP240 Direct Drive USB Pro Turntablewhich I ordered but have yet to receive.I'm giving this 4 stars, if it had been cheaper it would have gotten 5 stars."
2,Bright treble,"Model AT 440ML. Bottom line up front: The upper mids and highs are harsh and excessive, it's missing punchy mids, the bass is light and firm but not muddy or boomy. The upside is that stereo channel separation is awesome. Unless you like excessive treble then don't waste your time on this one."
5,Remarkable Value,"The superlatives you may read in reference to this elsewhere are --true--.This is probably the least expensive upgrade in a signal chain that I could recommend for audiophiles on a budget. This ~$100 stylus makes anyturntable I have sound as good as an audiophile CD player I have,and often better, depending on the quality of the Lp involved.This stylus provides a bright, highly detailed sound.For example, a 1966 copy of (rock trio) Cream's ""Fresh Cream"" on vinyl played with the AT-440MLa is substantially brighter and muscially crisp sounding than the most recent CD mastering I have, and that is a fine CD.This isn't true of any stylus: it is true of this one."
4,Good book,Not as informative as I would have thought it would be for all the cars (66-74). I hoped for more on the 73 and 74's though. If you are looking for info on 68-72 it's ok. They are merely reprints of articles from various sources compiled into book form.
2,Hope the spelling is corrected!,"I haven't bought this item, but I hope that they correct their spelling before anyone does buy one! They have ""scared"" for the word ""sacred"" at least in this photo. Yikes! And people think that spelling doesn't matter."
1,scared,"When ""scared"" vows are said? Shouldn't it be ""sacred""? I just purchased this yesterday but wish I would've looked closer before I did. Guess I'll have to send it back."
1,Did not fit,I was unable to use this wok ring with my stove. The ring did not lift the wok higher than my gas burner.
1,shoddy workmanship,"The first ring I ordered had one badly welded post (at the top ring). I exchanged it (thanks Amazon) and the second one was even worse... three posts badly aligned, two of them not even welded. Even if the workmanship had been perfect, the bottom ring did not fit over the burner ring on my electric stove top, and I also noticed that the wok would not sit level due to the ring being too smooth. I gave up and ordered one of the others (cheaper, holes versus the open design)."
3,"Not bad, but not what I wanted","I'd been wanting one of these for ages, so was eager to try it out on the stove - but it was a disappointment in the end. It slides around a lot, so never feels particularly safe (although I guess to be fair this has as much to do with the stove as anything; others may have better luck with that aspect), and raises the wok too high above the flame for my purposes. I've found it's easier to balance the wok on the burner, and to use the wok ring as a stand on the table - for which purpose it works perfectly!"
3,Shifty Ring,"This wok ring will serve as a stop-gap until I change my cooktop for one with a built-in wok burner. It will not be discarded, as it is a practical & stylish wok support for the benchtop."
1,This Book Blew Chunks!,"Honestly, I've never read a book where the author contradicts himself so much. Supposedly we are reincarnated over and over, and there is one soulmate for you who is also reincarnated over and over. But wait, then it says there are many soulmates for each person. To find them, you must telepathically send them messages to come to you. It might take years, but someday a person will show up and you'll just know it's the one. When that first happened to the author (he found ""the one"") he spent a lot of time trying to convince her that they were soulmates. She finally believes him, but uh-oh, they have nothing in common at all! Oops, maybe they aren't soul mates. Well, she was, but there are others too. WHATEVER! This book goes on and on like this. It makes absolutely no sense. I would not recommend buying it."
1,Not realistic,"He had some good points, but I think for the most part- this book contradicts itself.I'm sorry, but this soulmate search plants a seed of expectations. Then having expectations cloud your vision and colors your perceptions. Then your missing what is actually in front of you, missing out on possibly something even better than what your searching for. Maybe you will find what you are looking for if you just open your eyes instead of having tunnel vision. These expectations can make a person blind from acknowledgeing and maybe even realizing that that person that your currently with is a match for you. The person in search becomes not satisified and on a search outside of themselves to find their ""soulmate"" come on now, how much control do you really have in life?"
1,I didn't care for this book....,"...it was way too esoteric and I felt that the author was way off in left field! He didn't give any concrete, practical advice on finding or recognizing your own soulmate - he just went on and on about his own so-called ""soulmate"" experiences. The meditation exercises he suggests to do towards the end of the book to attract your own soulmate into your life was pretty goofy, too. If you are looking for a book that will give more practical, real world advice on finding your true love, I would recommend ""Soulmates : Following Inner Guidance to the Relationship of Your Dreams"" by Carolyn Godschild Miller. Godschild Miller's book at least will give you a sense of hope and some ideas of improving your own interpersonal relationships. Don't waste your money on Michael's ""Soulmate"" book - it's not even worth the paper it was written on."
3,Not Happy,"I knew I was buying used when I bought this but when it said it was in good condition I really don't know what they where looking at. The DVD case was all smashed up, the DVD had a bunch of scratches on it, the first thing I did was load it into my computer so that I could watch without fear of the scratches messing it up."
4,Brave New Girl,Allright movie. I wouldn't watch this over and over. I only buy it because it was produced by Britney and her mom. The movie doesn't really reflect the book. A must have for any Britney fan.
4,Brave New Girl,Saw the beginning of this movie on TV and never saw it again to see the end. So bought the movie and enjoyed seeing the entire movie without breaks. Everything went well from initial order to watching the movie. Well worth the price.
2,Well gosh darn,"I am so tired of movies that make people from Texas sound and act like they are all illierate and only know how to sing ""Yeller Rose a Texas"". The story was good. I enjoyed the movie once I let myself get past the sterotyping. Please someone-somewhere a movie that doesn't make people from Texas all look like hicks."
1,"Watch Life Time, it sux too!","It is Britney related, and therefore garbage, I can't believe I sat through this, it was horrible, predictable, and came FAR from pulling me into the characters."
4,"Good part, bad Amazon.","Just received this today, and the first thing I notice is that Amazon's description clearly states that it comes with the roller fairlead, and the instructions that come with the mount clearly state that it does not. It's not a huge deal but 70 some dollars for a piece of steel and a few bolts is a bit pricey. Having a free fairlead in there made it seem less painless at the time it was ordered.As for the part, it is thick steel and I like that it is in two pieces. One to mount the winch on and one to mount the oil cooler. This will hopefully provide my oil cooler with a little needed protection. I never really liked the fact that it was right out in the front exposed to whatever it was I was running into, and mine has some bent fins because of the current location.Overall, I'd say it's a bit expensive but it does seem to be better quality than some of the other, less expensive, mounts I've found."
5,Superb pool fun,Awesome I love this thing. Even I feel like shaq with this thing LOL. I run circles around all those 7 year olds..LOL. Seriously though this is a great toy. Still having fun with it. it's durable. I suggest this to anyone looking to add a little fun to their summer.
3,Not too sturdy,"I'm not as enamored with this product as others. The ball was too large for the net and was always getting stuck. We were careful with it, but the toy didn't last the season. I LOVE Swimways floats and thought this would be of similar quality. In my mind it is not."
4,It always worked for me,"I like the simplicity of this card and the great sound it has. I have been told that it does not work in all computers and you would have to test it. In mine it did but in a friend's compaq laptop with very similar carachteristics as mine it did not work. So watch out and make sure you can return it. For the ones that work, you are in for a great experience with many different audio options."
2,"Great specs, sounds great but crashes computer when ...","Would give it a higher rating but crashes the Dell Latitude (Win XP) when you stop the device (as recommended) and remove the card! Bought it to use the laptop for Software Defined Radio, where the higher bandwidth would be very useful and a stereo sound in is required (most laptops have mono-in). If you don't try to stop or remove the card then everything works really well. Quite a bit of the software that comes with is pretty badly implemented - sucks up processor power. Hopefully the crash issue will be fixed."
4,Careful with your slot!,"This is a PCMCIA card. New laptops (e.g. Dell Inspiron E1705) have ExpressCard slots. This is a new standard but it is not compatible with PCMCIA slot. Before going for this card make sure you have a PCMCIA slot in your notebook, or else the card won't fit. There is no ExpressCard soundcard yet."
3,"Great for some things, only so-so for others","The analog output was always a little noisy when my laptop was charging.Creative also fixes their digital outputs so that they only output at one word length and sample rate, (in the case of this card 24-bit, 96 Khz) and I could never for the life of me get them to sync properly with other digital equipment."
1,Do not But this card for music production.,"Anyone who is a music producer or who wants to get into music production do NOT buy this card. It has, by far, the worst sound quality for music production as it crashs frequently and crackles and hisses very badly. Go instead with an echo or an m-audio."
1,BAD DATA,"The claimed production here is odd. On the one hand, ' 2 pints an hour' - is not that a quart? Then the claim, 1.2 gallons an hour! WTF? BIG diff. I've no idea what I'm likely to get. And this is a survival tool. Come on Amazon. Nonsense. Dangerous nonsense."
5,Great Introduction to the Seige,"This book is unlike Glantz's books on Kursk, Kharkov, or Mars in that it is a slim, larger-sized hardback with a lot of photos and color maps. He also doesn't go into a large amount of detail. This scope makes it a lot easier to understand - while I understood battles that Erickson (in ""The Road to Stalingrad"") describes but I was confused about. Also, it's a good primer before jumping into ""The 900 Days"" by Salisbury."
3,Dull,"I found the book to be overly dull. Too much description of what units were where and which would attack. Read Harrison Salisbury for a good book on the siege. This might have been a well intended military analysis but leaves the reader gasping at all the details of unit locations, commanders, etc."
1,Not Worth $.02,"In 1994 this book was used at George Mason Law School for all 1Ls. It was a work in progress by Steven Crofton. He became unable to complete the book so Margret Brinig got the job of finishing it. It would have been a massive undertaking for Brinig and the results are a book that is very poorly written and edited. There are places where the exact same pages appear several times separated by 50 or so pages. While there are quantitative methods that attorneys should know, this book doesn't explain or present them. It has a smattering of cases and a lot of words that provide little information. George Mason Law ultimately quit using the book as it was such a piece of junk. I had to suffer through the book. I had both a BS and MS in engineering and can clearly attest that the book is worthless except as a paperweight."
5,"High carbon steel, well made, flat bottom, this does it all","1. High carbon steel seasons well (a process by which you impregnate the steel with a layer of oil.) Follow the directions. 2. Never wash a wok with detergent or put it in the dishwasher. We scrub ours out with coarse salt and follow with hot water, a swipe of a paper towel and then a bit of cooking oil. 3. The flat bottom isn't traditional but if you have an electric stove, it's required (the wok ring and round bottom don't work as well on electric stoves. To cool the wok, remove from the electric element; for gas, just adjust the gas level.) 4. The handle is also not traditional but handy and well made.In short, you can't find a better wok. High carbon steel WON'T rust if you take care of it according to directions. And it cooks better than non-stick surfaces, which should not be heated as hot."
2,Not for serious Chinese cook!,"I bought this wok 6 months ago. I seasoned it very well and started to use it. But I noticed the seasoning was easily peeled off when I cooked the dish with a lot of sauce. It meant I couldn't use it for steaming. When I made a fried rice, I had a hard time to clean it and re-season it. Most Chinese use a wok to cook everything, so I expected I could do that, too. But I was wrong. This wok is only good when you make a vegitable stir fry. That's all."
1,wish I never saw it,"I tried using it three times, finally got 3 bucks in garage sale. Everything tasted metallic, it was rusty every time I looked at it. Normal teflon fry pan does the same job, without the metal taste."
2,"great to cook with, but a pain to clean","Until purchasing this wok, I had never owned or cooked with one. I followed the seasoning directions, but didn't realize or notice that the thing isn't dishwasher safe. I don't remember the directions saying that it wasn't. It was completely rusted after running it through the dishwasher. I managed to get the rust off with a brillo pad and was able cook with it a second time. This time I washed it by hand and I noticed that it began rusting again. I'm guessing that it is ruined for good. I'm dissapointed that the wok is such a pain to clean. Next time I'll be sure to get teflon."
1,"Rusty,totally stain-prone","It got rusty right after I used it once. The situation gets worse within the first two weeks, and I put it as a flower pot on my balcony now."
2,Not robust enough for my desert plants,"I live in Arizona. I tried using these on my landscape plants: rosemary, Chinese elm, some oleander, some random wildflower type things, and cape honeysuckle.The tools do not bite into the plants -- they just graze through the flimsiest stems, leaving many/most branches uncut.The best way to get the tool to cut branches is to HOLD the branch with your free hand, and s-l-o-w-l-y cut it with the tool. That's a waste of time.I have used these successfully to touch up the edge of my lawn when I don't want to get out the edger/linetrimmer -- they do work on bermuda grass.Save your money."
1,Black & Decker Shear/Shrubber,"I was disappointed with this purchase as the product would not work at all. While it was not sold as a new item, I expected it to work."
3,less power than expected,"I had borrowed a friend's 3.6 volt B&D clipper. It was underpowered and the safety switch was on the side, almost impossible to reach. This one solved the safety switch issue, right on top for easy reach with the thumb. It is still underpowered though. I searched for a 12 (or larger) volt clipper but did not find one. This one certainly beats doing the job by hand."
1,Junk,"I used to have a great pair of Black and Decker Clippers/Shears but over the years they disappeared. So I bought these and what a disappointment, they have gone completely dull in on months time. I have bought my last Black and Decker product. Very disappointed. And yes it was very light along the patio cutting.Just a warning..."
3,underpowered,It works good but takes much to long to recharge. It would be better if it had a spare battery.
1,Only Runs 10-12 minutes,"The shears cut nicely, but only runs 10-12 minutes on a full charge. Not the 30 minutes advertised.I charged it for one week before using and it the first time and it ran 10 minutes.Charged again for 36 hours, and just held it on and it ran 12 minutes. Charged it again for 2 days, and it ran 12 minutes.I am returning it because you cannot get any work done when you can only use it 10-12 minutes per day!!!Junk!!!"
1,First one i bought didn't even turn on....Hope the second one does,I bought this item for my mother and we couldn't even get it to turn on - NOTHING - we checked everything we could but still nothing - So i returned it and ordered another one - Hopefully that one will work....
2,"Short battery life, almost impossible to replace","Many reviews point out that a charge doesn't last very long, but that hasn't been my problem as much as the battery itself dying after the first year. It won't hold a charge at all and it's so far impossible to replace just the battery pack. Way too expensive an item to require total replacement so soon...."
1,Poor battery life...,If I could give this zero stars I would. The instructions say to charge for 16 hours before first use. I followed the instructions exactly and got about 10 minutes of use for 16 hours of charge. I was just trimming some light grass around my rose bushes. Nothing thick or unreasonable for something like this. I was cutting it will scissors before but thought this would be quicker. It actually took me longer because it doesn't cut well and I still had to go get the scissors!!
3,The Shears,"These shears hold the charge very well and work pretty good. What I don't like is the trigger on the extension is very hard to use because of the safety catch and the wheels on the extension keep coming off. If you don't need the extension it's alright, but I use it because of my wheelchair."
1,Poor battery choice by Black & Decker,"The battery life is poor in this unit. Black and Decker still uses the old battery technology of NI-CD (Nickel Cadmium). This bad for the environment since it is a toxic heavy metal and poor charge life characteristics[..]They should change to NI-MH or lithium technology.I would not consider this unit until they change the battery technology which they have on other selected products.Until then, you are buying a limited life product with extremely harmful side effects."
4,Worth the money.,"Like most anything else opinions vary. Let the tool do the work and it does fine, try to force it and it doesn't cut very well, otherwise it's quite handy to have on hand."
1,Doesn't work well,"I read a lot of reviews about smaller hedge trimmers and decided on this one because it seemed to have fewer negative reviews. Unfortunately I am not happy with it. It doesn't hold a charge for long (30-40 minutes in my case), doesn't cut well, and jams easily. It also feels cheap. I do not recommend it at all."
1,disappointment,"This is a terrible design. won't cut grass, awkward alignment..loud too. Threw it away so I Wouldn't have to deal with the frustration"
1,Poor Battery Pack,"If I could give this item zero stars I would. One star is generous. The tool's battery pack simply does not last, and the batteries are a non-standard variety. Finding a replacement pack is impossible. After a year, the tool becomes disposable."
2,"Dull Blade, Poor Battery Life","Blade doesn't cut grass well. Replacement blades are worse! Shortly after the warranty ran out the battery died, so I am going to scrap this piece of junk. Waste of time and money!"
2,B&D trimmer,"Smaller and lighter than some others but only has a run time of 10-12 minutes. Trimmer attachment works well around sprayheads, bushes, corners and edging. Shrub trimmer attachment is too short and doesn't really cut that well. Switching between heads is a real pain. Almost need a clamp to release the buttons and a large screwdriver to pry it off. Have to be careful with the edging piece, blades bend easy. Will get something else when this one dies, probably soon."
1,Poor Performance,"Tried to use the shears for about one year..Very disappointed. Battery short, very dull and is nearly useless. Have resorted to the old fashion hand shears. Buy another brand."
1,Not recommended,"Battery life is actually pretty decent and the tool has as much power as you'd expect from a small clipper. But the tool just does a really lousy job of cutting anything... Grass, bushes, weeds, anything. You have to go over the same spot over and over and over."
1,Grass shear,I have to be honest. I bought this because it was Black and Decker and I was very disappointed. I bought a cheaper brand and it outperforms the B and D by a long shot. I wasted my money on the Black and Decker.
1,Don't bother - poor battery life,"I'll be trying to return this product. After charging the batteries for about 3-4 days, I was able to get 10 minutes from the unit trimming the grass. What a waste."
1,It won't cut grass!!!!!!!!,"The blades on this unit are no good at all.I tried to cut grass, and 50% of the grass gets pushed sideways between the top and bottom blade. You just have to keep working on the same spot of grass to get it all cut. I tried the shrubber blade, and it also did the same thing.The blades also rusted overnight. Maybe stainless would be a better choice for the blades.I also had trouble with battery life. I charged for 2 days, and I got about 10 minutes out of it.I think Black&Decker; needs to go back to the drawing board on the basics for this tool. I do love their other 18V yard products, but this one has to be returned."
1,Avoid This,This is a certifiable piece of junk. It lacks sufficient power to cut anything. Worx has a similiar product with a decent battery. I replaced my B & D with the Worx and it does a better job.
1,Don't Bother,"I've had other B&D grass clippers which worked great, which is why I purchased this one. After about two minutes of use it was clear that the product simply doesn't cut, it shreds, and doesn't do a good job at that either. It's going back!"
4,Great for edging my lawn,"So far I've used this mainly for edging my lawn, cutting around sprinklers and drains. It works great for that. I replaced the manual roller edger and grass shears. My neighbor has had one for a while and he's still using it, mainly for trimming shrubs and even trimming trees by attaching it to a swimming pool handle."
3,Works OK. Long battery life.,"Like any other rechargeable product, you need to give it an initial charge of over 24 hours before the first use. I was not able to run down the battery during regular use. The grass cutter attachment is poor, but I use a weed wacker for grass anyway. It's well balanced and fairly light in weight. My wife uses it, and she likes it.This replaced a Sears/OSH product which cut grass better, but had shorter battery life and the batteries could not be replaced (I was willing to make a new battery pack, but they were 2/3 C size which were impossible to find). This unit also uses 2/3 C size NiCd. So it may also be a throw-away once the batteries die. I wish they made a unit that used the VersaPak batteries."
5,For Every Christian on the Planet,"In a nut shell, this book is the best Christian book ever written. It has love, betrayal and adventure. It's set during medieval times where the Shroud of Turin is taken to this castle where no one believes in Jesus. It's top rate. If you love Camolot tales, and love Jesus, this book you'll always remember. I strongly recommend it for any reader."
5,Great book on the first 100 years of Studebaker,I have a copy of this book which was sent to me when I was a youngster who corresponded with the editor of The Studebaker News (a publication for Studebaker Dealers). I still have the original box that it was mailed in. I consider it a collector's item.
4,Fun and Easy to read!,"This book was very interesting and very informational. I was actually able to sit down for hours and read. I am not a person that is able to stay focused on one thing for a long period of time, but with this story I was constantly interested."
4,"Authentic, character driven","I'm not an ex-Navy man, so the constant Navy jargon left me sometimes only vaguely understanding what was going on. Nevertheless, I had the sense that this was what I would really experience if I were hidden, watching action from the back of the bridge of a Navy destroyer, and I valued that authenticity. But the setting was only a pallate for what was the deeper part of the book: men striving with tremendous stress and moral dilemmas. How do they cope, what do they think and do? Mr. Poyer is a keen explicator of human nature. After reading this novel, you'll feel as you had been there and struggled as the characters struggled."
3,"On a career track to oblivion, or worse","Great sea tale. David Poyer (Captain, USNR ret.) knows the Navy inside out, so the settings, machinery, drama, and ship's company are all spot on. Dan Lenson isn't the easiest hero to like--too much the loner, too easily blind-sided by his own vanities and insecurities, always on a career track to oblivion, or worse. But Lenson sailors on and, while he never makes it look easy, he always makes it right at the end."
3,Stressful but realistic,"A good account of life on older DDs. I served on three of them similar to this one, RYAN. Poyer perhaps puts this young Ensign in predicaments not normal, however it COULD happen. The corrupt XO is the real bad actor and he sets the tone for the ship.Nice to hear of life as it is on a small combatant we are too full of how aviators won the war! The Navy is, or should be, about ships such as RYAN. In case you like the trend towards airplanes being the Navy, we now have on TV a series of ;how the JAG Corps runs the Navy.Good story on the real Navy, Mr. Poyer."
3,"First half great, second half drags",The first part of the book is men versus the relentless sea. An aging World War II era destroyer sails into the Arctic circle in the middle of winter. It is a savage story of men against the sea and men against each other. You can see the ice building up on the decks and feel the wind cutting through their foul weather gear.But the book turns on the accident that occurs later in the book and the subsequent court-martial. I thought the ending dragged a bit.
3,Lenson A Bleeding Heart???,"After furiously reading all Poyer's novels, I CIRCLED back to this one.What a writer. I buried myself in his work one-a-week, until I was done. This is my least favorite. Its still good, and must be read. I came away feeling that Dan Lenson was painted in a very weak light. He was trusting and naive. I found myself groaning after reading a passage and screaming, "" Dan wouldn't do that!!"" Its still a Poyer must.Keith in Mission Viejo, Ca"
4,It's a good book for forest studies,This is a good book for forest studies. They reviewed so many papers (more than 2000 papers) in forest dynamics. It's a good tool if you want to find out more references quickly and easily for your researches.
3,Good but not great.,"Bought this product to use on my bagels and toast in the morning. Overall it is a good product, but the taste of clove is too strong for my liking. If you do not love the taste of clove, you may not care to have too much of this in one sitting."
3,very disappointed,"i went to montana a few years back and had some of their huckleberry products.they were amazing and full of flavor.this syrup has hardly no taste to it at all,very disappointed."
4,so far so good,"My original battery lasted over 2 yrs, so I have high expectations for this one.So far so good.It shipped promptly but arrived with a small chip off of the corner.It charges relatively quickly (aprox 30 mins) and lasts a couple of days even with regular use."
3,Poor Battery Life,"After purchasing a used VX8600 I found that the battery life was draining rather quickly; by the end of the day life would be down to one bar. I figured the used battery had been overcharged/used by its previous owner (it was 2 years old after all), so I opted to purchase a new one. The new battery is actually worse than the original used battery, beeping and shutting off by the end of the day. Good to have a backup and the battery does work, i just wish it had a little more life to it."
2,Its ok for short term use,"I bought this product to replace my original battery for my LG VX8600. I would not recommend buying or using this replacement battery for longer than a 60 day period. Although this battery came newly wrapped, it quickly lost its ability to retain charge after 2 weeks of normal use. It barely holds out any better than my old battery (needs to be recharged roughly every 12 hours). I received an extra Verizon battery thru an exchange on Craigslist, and even though this battery is over 12 months old, it works much better like the original battery (I have used it for about 1 month now and I have had no problems). I would suggest getting this replacement battery only if you are looking for a temporary short term fix until you get a new or used Verizon battery."
1,Not compatible with the vx10000s,This battery is not compatible with the new Lg vx10000s so don't waist your moneyhttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000MX681U/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title
1,LG replacement battery,"This battery was a major disappointment. I was not expecting an OEM life but in less than 6 weeks the battery began to lose holding a charge. Remember, you get what you pay for...next time I need a battery, I'll pay the extra money and buy the OEM. P.S. Just another note, I wouldn't but anything from this company."
1,Worse than 30 month old OEM battery,"I bought this battery to replace the original battery in my VX8600 that is well over 2 years old. I use my phone very infrequently, so a full charge on the old OEM battery lasts me about 3 days (down from about 10 days when new). I spent a few weeks and a few charge cycles charging this replacement battery and using it, then switched back to my original battery to make sure I wasn't just imagining poor performance. Well, I wasn't imagining it, my old battery holds a charge longer than this one. The company's response - I already had it too long. Right. I think they give you 30 days from the second you click ""order."" You get what you pay for."
1,Don't buy it!,"Actually, it really gets 0 stars because it only held a charge for an hour or two without even talking on it. Seemed like a great deal but turned out to be a complete waste of money. Look elsewhere."
4,Good Battery at a Great Price,I have used this battery for about 1 month and it works fine. It certainly beat paying 3-5 times as much for other batteries.
4,works great,"the delivery took a little bit, but what I asked for was what I got...the battery works just fine, it beats spending 40 dollars at a store!"
1,Impossible to service.,"I LOVED my Kenwood mixer, a 600 watt chef model carrying the ""Rival"" label. But after 5 years of very light use it appeared to simply ""die"" in the middle of a batch of cookies. The reset button didn't restore anything. When I inquired with a local servicer, I was told that NO PARTS can be obtained in the states, and that this difficulty worsened after DeLonghi's purchase of the manufacturer. I had terrible difficulty myself trying to get through to DeLonghi for servicing information. Fortunately, wiggling a loose wire resurrected the machine and made my husband a hero... until the mixer truly dies. This is a WONDERFUL machine, but FAR, FAR too expensive to market without the prospect of feasible servicing or at least a much longer warranty period!"
1,another broken mixer,"I have now bought 2 kenwood classic mixers, the first gave out after 4 years spilling the gears into the bread dough, and the second is starting to sound like a cement mixer after 2 yrs. I have a bunch of the attachments, hence the purchace of a replacement model. I don't abuse it in anyway, it should kneed 6 cups of flour. Its a shame given what they cost."
2,Not happy,"I own a Kenwood Major 500. The finish on it is totally pitted and discolored. I used NOTHING but a wet cloth to clean it. I called DeLonghi (bought Kenwood) and they gave me the brush off. Their customer service is very poor, in my opinion. I would think twice about buying a Kenwood/DeLonghi mixer. They have the identical finish as the one I have and I would be afraid it would discolor. Don't look for help from DeLonghi."
1,Broke after a few day's use,"The motor died in the middle of kneading a 3 loaf batch of bread. Before it broke I liked it a lot better than my previous KitchenAid and KTech, but it only lasted a month, so obviously I don't like it any more! Maybe that one was a lemon, my friends certainly never had any problems with theirs."
3,Old VS New,"25 years ago I bought two 7 Qt Kenwood (Majors). One for my wife and one for my mother. My wife liked hers, but over the years we twisted off several of the shafts that fit into the drive mechanism. After about 20 years of use and replacements of about every part on the machine I decided that the drive mechanism really wasn't strong enough for the size of the machine. I bought my wife a kitchenaid, but miss the size of the bowlI think the machine is quite good, but not as heavy duty as it should be.No problem putting the bowl in the dishwasher, but why take up the room when you can wash it by hand about as fast a loading and unloading the dishwasher."
5,Top Shelf Jazz,"This is a worthy addition to anyones jazz collection. Ostensably it is covers of standards. Eric Alexander, however, improvises freely and introduces a lot of fire into the tracks. Secondarily, but not unimportant, is the excellent sound quality. This CD was recorded at Van Gelder studios.Current jazz doesn't get any better than this. Tune in, turn on, and bop out."
2,Not as good as the first installment,"Let me begin by saying that Mr. Nice is my favorite book of all time and I respect Mr. Marks as a person and author very much. That being said, I think that Senor Nice does not measure up to the standards that Mr. Marks has created with his first autobiography. It is still a colorful tale of world travels and full of great history, especially if your Welsh. However, it does seem to drag out and I did find myself skimming over more than a few pages in this book. Overall I would say it is a great book as long as you hadn't read Mr. Nice prior."
3,Just not as big as you would think..,"I recently bought a 6 quart mixing bowl from Amco, and I was expecting the same quality -and frankly- space as the bowl. I was wrong.. I can fit my colander inside of the mixing bowl, so I don't understand how it's possibly 6 quarts. Not worth the money to ship it back though."
5,much better and longer than the first,"The first Robot Chicken: Star Wars (about 23 minutes only) had a couple of chuckles, but this second one (60 minutes) was the one that really had tons of laughs."
4,Robot Chicken Star Wars - GREAT,"It has some old scenes, but it's still great. It makes a great addition to my collection. Seth Green...you make me laugh!"
5,It robot Chicken,"Its robot chicken, what else is there to say. Really though it well made and very funny, but caution don't eat or drink anything while watching this. Unless you want to clean your drink of every thing or choke on food."
3,Where are teh real reviews???????,"Of course I like Robot chicken and humorous looks at Star Wars. The 20 minute clip was good ...... HOWEVER, I paid $14 dollars for 20 minutes of animation!! I was told this has other features and deleted scenes!I aassumed the deleted scenes would be fun - in deleted scenes - we had the producers say there are no deleted scenes.DO NOT PAY OVER $5 FOR THIS DVD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,Star Wars Robot Chicken,"I am NOT familiar with Robot ChickenNever seen anything else other than the Star Wars episodesBeing a Star Wars fan & collector for nearly 30 years I did enjoy the DVD.Most of the bits are funny. Not knowing Robot Chicken, is this normal to have curse words cut out on DVD's?That I did NOT like. It's a DVD, SAY THE WORDS.OK, the other thing I did NOT like about this. Carrie Fisher (Princess Leia) & Bill Dee Williams (Lando) supplied their voices on the DVD. OK, where? In only 1 part where Princess Leia was used could you tell it was Carrie & for Lando it sounded like someone doing an imitation of him. IN ALL PARTS WHERE THE PRINCESS LEIA & LANDO CHARACTERS WERE USED WITH LINES, CARRIE & BILLY DEE SHOULD HAVE BEEN USED FOR THE CHARACTERS THEY CREATED.Some good extras on the DVD."
3,ONCE AGAIN ANOTHER DISAPPOINTMENT,once more another one that is not uncut but it is edited even though it makes up for it with extra scenes then the tv broadcast it would have been better uncut.
2,unedited... bull crap,"they say this DVD is unrated, but when i was watching it all the cuss words were bleeped out"
1,Went for the $'s instead of quality,"Loved the first Robot Chicken Star Wars spoof. This one... don't even bother to rent it! It is lame, slapped together, very few laughs and obviously just trying to make a quick buck because the first one did so well."
5,Marcus is a schmuck,"...Philosophical Moments is a great book!! I've read it at least three times, and I'm still laughing when I read it. In no way is Eric Collins a rip-off of George Carlin. If anything, he's gone further with his comedy than Carlin ever did. If you want a great book with wonderfully intelligent humor,... buy this book!! You'll be glad you did!!!"
1,rip off,"this author is a sorry, sad pathetic thief of George Carlin's work. an utterly disgusting and blatant thievery of Carlin's trademark material, attitude and tone. enough to make one vomit, oddly enough, his 2nd book's title. if you are looking for an uninspired, unoriginal lump of literary fecal matter to blow 12 bucks on, be my guest :)"
4,Learn Drop 2 from a Master teacher,"Charles Chapman of the Berklee Music School explains Drop 2 chords in a simple, understandable fashion.Drop 2 chords are 4-note chords on the highest 4 strings (D,G,B,E) and middle 4 strings (A,D,G,B) on the guitar.They are a must to know for chord melody and comping jazz.Very good book."
4,If you like Thiebaud's work this is a great book,"Ever since my painting teacher first showed me a book on Wayne Thiebaud I've kept my eyes open to find one for myself. Then I found it on Amazon at a discount, I just had to have it. Someone pointed out that the plates aren't quite as intense in color as the originals and maybe they are right but they are still beautiful. The cakes and pies are good enough to eat but the street scenes of San Francisco are breathtaking. I'm happy with my purchase."
5,Enlightening!,"I own lots of art books, but this is already one of my favorites. I stare and stare at these pictures and marvel at what he has done. The painting is so simple at first glance, and so much more complex and fascinating the longer I look. If you are a painter, there is very much to be learned from these paintings. The phrase ""paint lovingly applied"" in the editorial review is most apt--and as a result, one loves looking at it. This man is really a PAINTER, an artist who revives one's faith in painting here at the turn of a century that has seen more than its share of charlatans and feeble talents. Everything he paints looks profoundly delicious, and the landscapes and cityscapes from the 80's and 90's are like thrilling dreams. The book is a revelation!"
5,Never See SF the Same Again!,"This book has a wonderful collection of his work from the 60's to the present time. His style and view of everyday life is both inspiring and dramatic, sometimes his perspective is unnerving as well. It is a great book for those who love realism and nostalgia, with a twist."
3,Too much advertisement,"This book uses a lot of ""real companies' data"" (including the boycotted clothing retailer and recently bankrupt airline). The real companies' data come with a lot of advertisements, which is kind of disturbing."
2,"Decent textbook, but terrible end of chapter problems","For something as mechanical as accounting, this textbook does an ok job in teaching it, even though there are certain areas that it lack (good comprehensive examples, for one). However, the end of chapter problems are pretty bad. They'll ask you things that the book doesn't even mention until later on, and most the problems are extremely monotonous. (yes accounting is boring, but they can at least TRY make it a little more interesting). There are better intro to accounting text books out there"
2,Not exactly what I ordered. . .,"I was expecting a hardcover book and got a softcover instead. It is already torn up pretty badly, transporting it back and forth to class."
3,Great guide for 2003... but now outdated,This book must've been great back in 2003 but many of the restaurants they list have gone out of business or moved. There are also many amazing vegetarian restaurants that have opened since 2003 that are not listed like Kung Food in San Diego. This book is in serious need of an update.
4,Hard To Find Ribbon For My Printing Calc...,"I have a Canon MH series printing calculator and after I got to the end of the ribbon I just ignored the fact that I could barely read the print for about a year. Last summer I wanted to copy the print over to another document, and to do that it has to be fresh new black cartridge.I lost my opperating instructions for the calculator and to make a long story short called Canon. They did not have the part but sent me to Nukote, who specialize in all sorts of ribbons. I ordered one of the c wind BR80 spools to test if it was the correct thing. I really wish I could have gotten it through Amazon Prime, because the shipping is too much on one little spool. Thats where a lot of these 3rd party companies make a profit.It has been working well for about two weeks now. I will keep an eye on it to see how often it needs changing. We will all be broke just from ink cartridges and ribbons for all our calculators and printers."
2,Just too goofy,"Was it Wally West portrayed as a greater whiner than even in his most whiny days in the comics?Was it the awful characterizations of the other JLA members, speaking and acting not at all like their comic (or cartoon) counterparts?Was it the big deus ex machina at the end that helped defeat the villain, change DCU continuity, and resolve all of Wally's character woes?Was it other odd continuity gaffes, like suggesting that Iris Allen has never actually met Batman?Was it the Flash, in the very first sentence of the book, ""flying"" through the air at superspeed and duking it out with meteors?I have no idea. But this is probably the weakest of the DC JLA novels I've read to date. Mark Schultz has written some good stuff in the past, but this isn't representative of it."
4,Super Reader,"The first two pages were very bad, but it was all uphill from there. It got better and better as it went along, much like the Green Lantern part of this series, although the end of this was better than that. A faster than light universe wrecking serial killing super beast - how do you stop it, that is the problem. This novel cleverly involves his aunt Iris, the Justice League, and The Flash. It is really intriguing to see a writer delve at length into what he is thinking while superspeeding, which you can get in comics, but only in tiny, tiny parts.Oh, and a new term for the geeks - cryptospeedsters, that was great."
3,Average Book,"This book is actually pretty relatable for any elementary school girl that likes horses. Boys tend to pick on them becuase they happen to like a specific hobby. In this book the real problems arise when May punches Will, a boy who has been teasing Jasmine about her like of horses. Jasmine gets upset because she wanted to deal with the problem her own way: by ignoring the boy until he lost interest in harassing her.The story is a bit stilting, like the author was a little unsure of how to adjust her style to better suit a younger audience than the ""Saddle Club"" readers. Overall an OK book good for 3rd graders and up but I can definitely say that this series gets much better as the books go on so keep reading!"
3,Entertaining but biased,"Francis' book is an entertaining read with vivid accounts of how and why he was imprisoned. However, considering the circumstances of his time spent in detention, one wonders how he can remember such details about specific interrogation sessions. Some creative embellishment to spice up the narration was probably afoot. Where did fact end and literary fiction begin was a question I pondered constantly. His book is as biased as those favourable on the Singapore regime. Nevertheless, a must read for one interested in understanding Singapore's security apparatus and Lee Kuan Yew.Jeremy"
2,I can't believe I used to like these guys.,Ya know the line from Repo-man when the CJ's are playing acoustic. Well it fits. I used to love this album but Keith got so preachy and an esoteric sentimentalist that I can't even enjoy listening to this anymore.Then the big Sony punkumentary is enough to make any old timer puke.
3,ok set of songs,"The Circle Jerks were another legendary CA band.this song does not capture their live show, which was quite good."
2,Two songs save this album....,"This is when the Circle Jerks started going downhill. Coup d'etat is the best song on the record and it's a five star song. High price on our heads is a four star song. The rest are one and two. Like so many bands they seem to change their sound and instead of appealing more to the listener, they go off on their own and re-invent themselves. I love the Circle Jerks and I like this album, but if you own just one Jerks album it should be Group Sex. That's their best album ever...."
4,Old School,"This is the way it was, children. This is where all your grunge, neo-grunge, post-grunge Seattle scene garbage came from. This is silly, rough, and sounds like it was recorded in a garage. This is the source of everything you losers listen too. Well, actually that's Bob Mould, but the Circle Jerks are iconic for everyone else."
4,good punk release,"A good Jerk's release , not as good as Group Sex and Wild in the Streets , but alot better than Wonderful and VI . The songs are still loud and slamming , but you can feel the band's energy burning out somewhat , but producing some memorable moments "" Red Blanket Room"" , ""Junk Mail"" and the hillarious final track ""Jerks on 45"". I wouldnt' recommend this to be your first Circle Jerks album , get Group Sex and Wild in the Streets first , then get this one ."
4,I love this music!,"Crusell sounds so much like Beethoven (in a good way), and the clarinet playing is very, very good. I heard this in the radio and found out what it was & bought it. I play this in my car all the time while I'm driving around - it's really uplifting, helps me have a good outlook and attitude!"
4,Liked it then--Like it now,"I grew up with my old sisters playing and singing her songs all the time. ""Son Of A Preacher Man"", ""I Only Want To Be With You"", ""You Don't Have To Say You Love"", seemed to play on the radio non-stop back then. My sisters (like many) loved her songs and I liked them too, though Dusty's material has a soft edge. This recording is good listening from start to finish and a must for fans of 60's Pop music."
4,Dusty Springfield: Hits Collections,"This collection is distinctly Dusty. A few of her hits/covers are not included, but by far the best is, and that makes this collection quite good for Dusty fans."
5,A Fantastic Collection of Dusty's greatest hits!,"This compact disc is a great collection of her hit songs like Windmills of your Mind, How Can I be Sure, and You don't have to say you Love me plus so many others of her greatest hits. This compact disc collection is worth the price just to hear Dusty singing her greatest hits. I don't think we appreciated her until after she left us or at least we didn't tell her enough that we loved her. We love you Dusty."
1,Horrid Soundtrack,"I don't know why ""remastered music"" sounds so awful to me. I wish I hadn't purchased this . The DVD doesn't do Dusty Springfield justice."
1,horrible,"Do not order this bike from Amazon, I ordered it for my son's 8th birthday and when he opened it the front metal bars were bent. [...]. Anyways after 4 months of getting no help we just went and bought him a different bike at a store. Even the bike company was of no help they told me they would send me out a new part, but that was also 4 months ago."
3,Not quite a perfect read-aloud,"Keith Faulkner has written some excellent classroom pop-up read-alouds. (My favorite being The Wide-Mouth Frog.) His new book, Ten Little Monkeys, also has possibilities as a classroom read-aloud for Pre-K or Kindergarten. The book's concept and colorful artwork are very appealing . A large pop-up tree and 10 cardboard monkeys bring a fun interactive element. This pop-up ""falls flat"" in two ways. The book and ""tree"" cannot be viewed simultaneously. And, all of the text does not flow. Although not quite perfect, Monkeys is still one CUTE book."
3,Not as the aticle said.,"I bought this cd after reading an article about the band.The article said the group was a mix of funk,rap soul. When I listened to the cd it was accapella style,and nothing like the story said. Just trying to make a sale I guess.Better luck next time as articles in the paper dont even tell the truth. Really Let Down...."
3,good wok but handle fells off quickly,"the handle is mounted with only two rivets, started rocking soon after I got the wok and fells off later. Her daughter Helen Chen's wok with 4 rivets mounting the handle is much better approach."
2,Not a taste of home,"Growing up, I would go to my parents to Wyoming to visit grandparents. My grandmother would make chokecherry jelly, and we thought it was wonderful -- I've been looking for chokecherry jelly ever since.Unfortunately, this wasn't it. The consistency is almost to jelled to be able to spread, and the wonderful tartness of the berries is way overshadowed by the sugar.I guess I'll have to keep looking."
5,Don Williams Love Songs,My husband I love to listen to Don Williams. We are now buying his CDs. We have one CD in the van to listen to when we travel. I bought this CD to add to the collection.
3,"3 stars for music, acting, and scenery","Okay, I liked the music, the acting, and the scenery here--especially the scenes on St. Helena. But the film is a narrative mess, slowly paced and plodding at times, and I had to pause it a lot to get up and take a break. Never a good sign. It could have been much more cohesive and not nearly as long. Note re length: it's fine if the film is good; not so fine if the film is dull."
5,A real good book on the war in the Pacific,"The book is one of my favorite of the WW2, easy to read and clearly explain the gigantic struggle in 1942 of the US Marines fighting the Japanese sailors and solders."
4,Exelant,I bought this book thinking it was a personal account of Leckies exsperiance.It is not. It is however a very thorough account of the battle from both sides.I was not dissapointed though as it is a great read. Buy it!
5,best home mixer available,"I have used this mixer for two years and everything turns out ""bakery quality,"" even the chocolate chip cookies seem professional...frosting is better than anything I've ever made. And, this mixer has 300 wats MORE power than a Kitchen Aid. VERY worthwhile appliance."
1,"Impossible to service, especially under new owner DeLonghi.","I LOVED my Kenwood mixer, but after 5 years of very light use it appeared to simply ""die"" in the middle of a batch of cookies. The reset button didn't restore anything. When I inquired with a local servicer, I was told that NO PARTS can be obtained in the states, and that this difficulty worsened after DeLonghi's purchase of the manufacturer. I had terrible difficulty myself trying to get through to DeLonghi for servicing information. Fortunately, wiggling a loose wire resurrected the machine and made my husband a hero... until the mixer truly dies. This is a WONDERFUL machine, but FAR, FAR too expensive to market without the prospect of feasible servicing... or without a much longer warranty period! I will greatly hesitate to replace it with another."
5,Better than Kitchenaid!,"I love this mixer! It is SO much better than a Kitchenaid. The motor is much more powerful and more versatile because of its many speeds and pulse mechanism. It's a great choice! After many years, it still works like it was brand new and I have never had a problem with it once."
1,Sixty-Dollar Flop,"I bought the kindle edition of this book for an exciting new class I'm taking on public policy, thinking that I would try out the e-text thing that everybody seems to be doing. Sixty-something dollars later I found out the hard way that this text is not compatible with the e-ink Kindle, meaning that while it's still readable I'm anchored to my hulking powerhouse of a computer instead of being able to read anywhere I want. Worse, Amazon's debatably draconian DRM policies render me unable to reformat this text to something more suited to my reader. I come away from this whole experience with a bad taste in my mouth--unwilling to shell out another sixty bucks and give the company a free pass, so to speak, and in need of a text that I can actually read in places other than my computer room.Time to head to Barnes and Noble's website."
1,Unfortunately biased for an academic book,"Lester et al.'s work of describing the policy process aims to survey the making of public policies from a descriptive perspective. Unfortunately, the authors present a strong dualistic bias in their analysis, pitting good ""liberal"" policies against evil ""conservative"" policies. The result does not make for a balanced nor objective book, and as such mostly serves as rhetoric material for partisan purposes, not a genuine scientific analysis. As such I do not recommend the book unless one wishes to build an argumentation from a strictly partisan perspective, not a public policy perspective, at it lacks in intellectual rigour and objectivity, unfortunately."
4,Football: Winning Offense,"This book covers practically all aspects of football from an offensive viewpoint. From warm-ups to extra points, and everything in between, Coach Wilkinson tells everything you need to know about offense. This book will help any coach looking for a general offense book that covers formations, plays, techniques and many other facets of the game."
5,From Sheep to Sweater and back to Sheep,"This book is just wonderful. My 3 year-olds love it. It's silly and entertaining and also educational. If anyone in your family is a knitter, spinner or weaver buy it for them (no matter how old they are). It's a great book for grandparents who knit, etc. to share with little ones.In this time when we are more and more removed from the land this book does a great job of showing children how the sweater came to be on their back. You just can't go wrong with this one."
5,Love love love this book!,"I got this based on the fact that I love nearly all the books that Nadine Westcott has illustrated. I love the book even more than I expected.My 2 year old and I adore this book. The story is charming. I think it's great that the farmer is so concerned for his sheep when they get cold. We need picture books where men have feelings and act considerately, too!The rhymes and use of onomonopia are perfect. We just read this book again last night after putting it away for a few weeks, and my daughter said ""twist, hum, twist hum"" when we got to the spinning wheel page. To me, that says it all. She is interested enough to remember those words."
2,basic backstroke swimming technique,"I feeled being cheated when I bought this dvd and another dvd from thesame coache: basic freestyle swimming technique for these reasons:1. More than half of the 2 dvds are exactly the same things, just a duplicate scenes.2. No underwater camera, can not see the body movements clear.3. A lot of talks that are not useful for learning.4. The prices are too high compared with other sellers.5. More like this dvd aim at teenagers, not for adults."
1,The worst book ever!!!!!,"This is the worst book I have ever read about poker,and I have more than 20.This is not a book for serious poker player at all,it may teach some compulsive gamblers how to reduce their losses but nothing more.I paid $4 for it and I regret for buying it,don't waste your money.(I am not surprised that used copy of it goes for $1+shipping)"
4,Playing poker with a straight head,"Pretty solid book. Helps getting you in the right state of mind when playing poker. I believe this is crucial to your game and have enjoyed the book. Easy to read and a good flow to it. Definitely feel like its improved my game and would recommend it. Just to give you a comparison I have read the following and thought they were solid poker books as well: Super System, Harrington on Hold'em, Phil Gordon's little green book, Caro's Book of Tells, and In the Money Strategies for winning texas Hold'em cash games. I have read other poker books but don't think they are worth purchasing.....GOOD LUCK!"
4,One of the best book for the novice players.,"This is one of the few poker books that is easy to understand and follow. Unlike other basic poker books, this book puts emphasis towards the learning the darker side of poker. This book will give you the basics of intimidating your opponents, and bluffing. It wasn't until I found my game and look back to realize what a great introduction this book has been. If you understand Holdem, you would know that there aren't enough good hands to win the game and a player is usually forced to bluff or bully. While most beginner books tend to focus on the rules of the game and basic strategies, most fail miseriably when they attempt to teach the art of bluffing. Although this is not a perfect book, it should give you the basics you need inorder for you to figure out the rest. This is a must have for tight players who do not know how to play aggressive."
1,I am sure the author is not a winning poker player,"The book is full of ridiculous advice like raising five hands in a row regardless what you hold to intimidate others. Ladies and gentlemen, if you do that, by the end of the five hands, your $100 buy in (assume you play 3/6) would be gone. The rest of the table would really love you (intimidated?....yeah right).[...]"
2,Don't bother,"Killer Poker has very little practical information on the mechanics of playing poker. It doesn't advise you when to play, raise, fold, or bluff. Rather, the advise it offers can be boiled down to, play aggressive and always try to be aware of, and fix, your mistakes. If this book had given some method for identifying and correcting mistakes it would have been worthwhile. There are other, much better, books on poker out there."
3,Waltz time etc.,"This is quite a good music video if you like Strauss. Be warned the Running Timer is misleading,they state 70 mins and in fact comes out at 97 mins. Very similar tothe New Year Concerts."
1,Not 1J0823359C,"The part number used as this item's description and the picture both are what I need. Specifically, a hood strut for a VW Golf highline. The highline cars get a silver hood strut. The other cars get a black one. The black one's part number ends in D. The black one is what they sent...well, an aftermarket version of it anyway. By using a VW part number and showing a picture of the VW part that corresponds to it, I expected to get what I ordered. I did not."
4,Authentic and relatively easy to follow,"Having my Moroccan husband love everything I have made from this book, is worth its' weight in Gold! My husband doesn't need recipes to cook because he has done it for 30 years (but still doesn't have consistent results when he cooks) but being an American, I needed to measure and have directions to follow. The Harira in this book was according to three Moroccans - the best they ever tasted and the dish with beef stew meat, artichoke hearts and fava beans (I substituted Lima beans) was also a huge hit."
5,Love this Cookbook,"I'm not really an amazing cook, but the recipes in this book are easy and look really impressive. The truth is, I bought it for the photographs, but it has become my go-to cookbook for parties and special meals."
2,The most overrated industrial/ebm album of all time...,"In the many many years since I've been listening to industrial and ebm, spanning several hundred purchases, I have sold maybe three albums that I've bought. This was one of them. Every note on this album is a ripoff of either Covenent or Apoptygma Berzerk. I listened to it twice and could not tolerate another. I've read that some people call this ebm. A thumping 4/4 beat with equal emphasis on every beat is not ebm; it is reanimated Disco Frankenstein. The only reason I gave this album a 2 star rating instead of no stars is because there are many people who obviously enjoy discotized ""industrial"" dance, as evidenced by the large number of Covenent fans. If you are a Covenent fan, buy this album. If you are not, buy Empires. It is far superior to Praise the Fallen. Or better yet, blow your hard earned cash on Feindflug or Suicide Commando."
5,Indescribable.,"The CD is beyond words. I didn't want to leave the opening track, Chosen, after hearing it. The narration mixed with melodic undertones was excellent. Once I did move past it, the tracks kept me up. Funker Vogt-ish EBM in the next few. Pounding electronics. Then, as I moved to the 9th track, Solitary, I fell in love. The lead's voice is beautiful and still gives me chills every time I listen to it. I recommend it to anybody who likes EBM, Goth, Industrial, or even Synth Pop. I heard the artist/group's name from a friend and I owe him big."
4,Apocalyptic EBM,"This is really a great EBM record, but it does take some time before you can really appreciate it. In fact, I probably still haven't reached that point just yet. There's just something about it that makes it very compelling. Bleak is probably the best word to describe it. The songs tend to deal with wars, and the entire album has a kind of futuristic, apocalyptic feel to it (it's great to listen to while playing war games).My favorite track on the cd is definately Honour, but Solitary and Procession are both outstanding as well. The album closes with the very serene and peaceful PTF2012, which is followed by one minute of silence and a dreamy harpsichord-like track. This serves towrap up thhe intensity of the album nicely, and leave you feeling rested and at peace. Highly recommended to any fan or would-be-fan of EBM."
4,I love the atmospherics and sound textures!,"i give these guys a lot of praise for sound engineering, there are some of the most amazing sounds to come out of a synth i've ever heard! the beat is good, very hard and fast at times :) and the synth lines are crisp and beautiful. if you like Funker Vogt, or Apoptygma Bezerk, or even some of the old-school EBM music like Front 242 then this cd should place well in your collection. the only problem i have with this group is that their song writing could use a little work, not all of the lines match in rhythm all the time. still it is far better than its minor singing faults."
3,Visually appeasing but doable?,"A visually appeasing book and an easy peruse. If anything, I enjoyed peering into aesthetically designed rooms and homes, many of them seemingly--judging from the written content of the book--located in the United Kingdom. However, I found some of the concepts too complex for your run-of-the-mill Feng Shui newbie, like myself. And, I can't imagine how one could perform all this transformative feng shui-ing in one weekend, even if the reader forfeited Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights' sleep. For someone wanting to get a beginner's grasp on Feng Shui, there are better book choices."
2,Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart: Piano Concerto No.25 / Piano Sonatas,"Boring! I wanted music like the sounds of the Amadeus sound track of the movie which is more exciting. It's good background music, but not what I wanted."
1,This is fake,"This is not a Blu-ray disk, it is a recordable DVD burnt like a Blu-ray.The brand is ""RIDATA"".The cover was printed in a ""ink jet"" printer.What is going on??????????I'm so disappointed with Amazon!!!!!!"
1,deceptive,"I really want to write a good review, but I must warn people about this disk.IT IS NOT A BLURAY!As you read that you might think... "" So what's the big deal? "" Simple, Amazon markets it as a bluray. The case, and the insert inside markets it as bluray... but this is a DVD. Again you might say "" So, it's a DVD? Big deal "" Thing is, it's not even a professional press. The damn DVD is nothing more than disks you can buy at any retailer.Final note... Some guy used nero and made a bunch of copies with dvds he bought at fry's electronics for $25"
3,5.1 Remastered?,"I got this to test out my DTS HD 7.1 sound system and my new Panasonic DMP BD55 player (great -- from Amazon). The packing looks like something you would buy on the street in Shanghai. The paperwork liner is sketchy and cheap. What intrigues me is the phrase (which IS included in the Amazon ad info -- and I missed): ""PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS RECORD WAS ORIGINALLY PRODUCED FOR 5.1 AND PRESENTED FOR 7.1 SURROUND SOUND REPRODUCTION TO PROVIDE YOU WITH UNIQUE ACOUSTIC REALITY EXPERIENCE."" The music is fine and it drives all 7 speakers and subwoofer but I have feeling this is an ""upconverted/remastered"" recording. I also got the similarly packaged and documented Vivaldi ""DTS-HD Master Audio Disk"" recording for a total of $45. Is there any ""native mastered DTS-HD"" (my terminology) available? Three stars because I am suspicious."
1,This DVD did not play on my blu ray player!,"I have two Sony Blu-ray Players BDP-S470 and the old BDP-S300, both updated with the latest and current firmware versions. When I tried to play the DVD, both players displayed a message: ""Can not operate disc"". When I received the disc from Amazon.com, I noticed the DVD didn't have a security tape around it which made beleive that sone else returned it as non-playble. The Blu-ray disc is region 1 and should play in the United States. I returned it to amazon and requested a replacemnet but it's out of of stock right now. Did anyone have the same problem out there?Thank you."
4,Immediate Relief for the Humdrummery of Running,"Training for cross country or distance track events can often become tedious work. Anderson does a great job of providing simple, ready-to-use games and techniques that will help combat this problem. I found many of the ideas useful and easy to use right away. Other ideas were not so adaptable to my team, but I still used the nuggets he have in the book and manipulated them to meet my needs. My athletes responded with enthusiasm. While nothing can take the place of mileage, the mindset an athlete has during the mileage can set the tone for the whole training experience. Although this book may not meet the needs of the reader to a tee, it is broad enough to enable the reader to create his/her own variation on the theme. Solid book for coaches."
3,.The butterfly effect,"I started out watching Salman's newest films. I enjoyed this film made when he seemed to be ""becoming Salman Kahn"". You can almost see the change in him to come. I like this more loveable boy and the beautiful songs. The story was interesting. What's not to love, beautiful people, great music, and wonderful scenery!"
1,Tumko Na Bhool Paayenge,"The seller appeared to be a seasoned professional. Prior to shippment, he viewed the DVD and discovered that the recording was bad. He refunded my money. I will still like to own the DVD is I could lay may hands on a good one.The rating is for the defective product, not the Seller's customer service."
2,"Pretty Design, but...","These earrings have a pretty design, but the stones were reddish brown, not the deep red that I prefer. I returned them."
1,junky quality.,"Do not buy this garbage. It will last for a few days, it has very weak structure, which doesn't hold balls. Also it may leave scratches in the trunk.Throw away this garbage"
2,gamma ballhopette,"I didn't realize that the handles do not open up so you can use it as a stand. Its difficult to get the balls out when practicing serves and you literally have to bend down and pick up the balls. Its not durable, the metals are starting to bend."
5,Highly recommended!,"Richard Rohr's ""Everything Belongs"" is an amazing book that not only encompasses contemplative prayer but also speaks about the christian life in general. I just finished high school and I highly recommend it to other teens (and adults, too) who are tired of all the liberal/conservative christian rhetoric and who are searching for the ""Third Way,"" taking the best from the liberals and the conservatives and building a new outlook on life. I also recommend his ""Simplicity: the Art of Living,"" however I do think one unacquainted with Rohr should start with ""Everything Belongs."" I'm not joking when I say that Richard Rohr is my role model! Also, if anyone is interested in a more structured approach to learning about contemplative prayer, I highly recommend ""Arcmchair Mystic: Easing into Contemplative Prayer"" by Mark Thibodeaux, S.J. I can honestly thank Fr. Thibodeaux to introducing me to the wonderful journey of the contemplative lifestyle!"
5,Life Changing,"The most powerful book I have read on issues of spirituality, contemplative prayer, self acceptance. A must read, Catholic or not."
5,The mystery of contemplative prayer.,Rohr writes in heartfelt language what it means to search for and live in the presence of God. Great book!
5,This book captivated me,"This book caught me from page one and held my interest throughout the last page. Very well written and extremely thoughtful. Rohr knows of what he writes.I am a Presbyterian, and did not find this book to pertain to Catholics only. I will buy his other books, and will order additional copies of Everything Belongs for gifts."
4,Book review,I have not finished this book but what I've read so far is excellent. Very thought provoking and inspiring. Well written. Will finish this but am reading two other books for a book study I'm in in just now.
1,Very disappointing,"If you want to learn anything about contemplative prayer and inclusive spirituality, buy another book. This is barely readable, disorganized and, at times, ranting. I wondered if it was written at a time the author was under great stress or felt persecuted by his church. Every so often there was a glimpse of an interesting idea that got lost in the rambling stream of prose. The only reason I read to the end was because I was going to a discussion group on this book. This author has written other good books but this isn't one."
1,If you are new to eBay and common sense,This is a great book if you lack common sense or judgement deficiency. And this is the 2nd edition. Consider the book eBay the RIght Way instead.
4,A much different kind of p-funk,"I remember seeing this album at the record store and even though it warned that George Clinton did nothing on this album, I got it anyway!! I was blown away! This was not the Funkadelic I knew. I thought it sucked at first but when I heard ""The Witch"" & ""Who's A Funkadelic"", I got my funk fix without the ""P"". I sometimes wonder what would of happened if George had been a part of this?? A very good effort!!"
5,Excelente,What can you say about a calculator ribbon? It was warm and sexy and when the package arrived we had a torrid affair which included my calculator...wow!Package got here on time and we are using the tape!As usual great service from Amazon and its sellers!
2,too little for too much,"I've had my Dyson for two years and I just don't liek it. It is clumsy and difficult to haul around- the cord is WAY too short- you can't clean a regular sized room without changing plugs. The cord rewinder doesn't rewind, the cannister is difficult to clean...."
2,Very Disappointed :(,"I purchased a Dyson Stowaway Canister Vacuum. It's not really all that it is cracked up to be, and you are pretty much just paying for the name. The suction isn't the greatest. I find myself repeatedly going over areas several times to collect up all of the dirt. It works great on carpets, but on hardwood floor and ceramic tile, it's useless! Yes, it's pretty, and yes, the no-bag feature is a bonus, but overall performance, it wont be on my Christmas list any more! Even the hose doesn't stay in place when you coil it up for storage and it's very awkward and heavy to carry."
2,Dyson DC21 eats expensive rugs,"I have an old DC02 from England, loved it so much when I moved to the USA I bought a big stepup transformer so I had 240volts to run it here in New York.The hose on the DC02 broke and its not a US available part so I bought a DC21 as replacement.The DC21 has a single fatal flaw,the motorised head has bristles so hard they shred persian rugs. Yes it has an off button but guess what the brains trust set it up so everytime you turn it on the motorised head starts up again.We have little kids who delight in turning the machine off then on again as you vacuum. This sadly kills it for me.Of course if you have new rugs and want them to show the abrash that comes with age, the DC21 will help the rugs get there all the quicker."
1,Machine does NOT suck!,"And I do mean that in a negative way.This is the animal hair Dyson, and on bare floors, it won't even pick up dust, much less cat hair. I am very disappointed. I have ""troubleshot"" everything, and there is just no sucking power for this machine. I might as well get out my old corn broom and sweep.Most people gripe about the engineering and design of this model. Well, I would not care if it looked like it was designed by Rube Goldberg. I expect it to suck up a segment of a small dried leaf. Zippo. Nadda.Stay away from this machine. I have no more time to waste to figure out why it will not do what it says it is supposed to do."
3,Hose is too fragile,I have had this canister for a little over a year and the hose broke twice already. Dyson charges around $150 for the hose replacement.
3,This vacuum sucks !,"So far, overall, I like the vacuum but compared to my Sears Kenmore canister, it is cheaply made. For the price, it should have had a longer cord, better made hose and attachments. You cannot vacuum berber because it literally pulls the carpet fiber into the vacuum and ruins your carpet. DO NOT vacuum berber throw rugs with it !"
3,Powerful but somewhat awkward,I have owned product now for about two month. The pros are the suction is powerful and it picks up great on carpets. Also it is very easy to empty out garbage from cannister. The negatives are it is hard to maneuver around. You want to go in a certain direction and the cannister needs some adjustment on your part physically to make it go in the same direction you are pulling it to. Also the hose attachment is too thick to get in some hard to reach areas.
5,Dyson Canister Vacuum,"The Dyson canister is by far the best vacuum I have ever owned. I am able to clean areas I could never get at with my uright. It cleans right up to the wall edge and under the coffee table. It stores away in a very small space. Plenty of suction , nice long hose makes it easy to reach around furniture. Heppa filter never needs replacing and no bags to buy makes it a good value in the long run. All that and a 5 year warranty."
2,Wrong Wand,"We had high expectations for this vacuum, and it may be a great vacuum for carpeted areas, but since our home is all hardwood flooring, it doesn't satisfy our needs. We like the bagless canister and sturdy polycarbonate construction, but the expandible wand is over-engineered for hard flooring, too bulky and ineffective, with the hard floor attachment installed. Our (Fein) shop-vac consistently outperforms it in its ability to pick up all forms of debris. The wand is so bulky it's near impossible to raise it above eye level for cleaning various trim pieces and windowsills, et. al. I see that Dyson has introduced an ""All Floors"" bagless canister, but for $750!? There's really nothing wrong with this little machine, if we could get a different, less bulky wand that works on hard flooring..."
2,Great Suction VERY POOR design and engineering,"Dyson knows how to build a vacuum that can really pull the dirt out, but has failed on all other accounts. The cord is so short that you have to pplug it in 3-4 times on one level of the house and the cord retract is so bad you have to hand feed the cord back into the unit. The telescoping wand collapses at will and the hose kinks up constantly. The canister is very small and fills easily. The telescoping wand only has 2 positions; all the way out or all the way in. The unit draws so many amps that it blows a 15 amp breaker with nothing else on the circuit. The attachments fall off easily and are cheaply made. There is no on switch on the handle- very inconvenient. The handle will not lock in the vertical position so you either lay it down or or hold on to it. I returned mine after two weeks of use and went back to my 6 year old kenmore."
5,Terrific Vacuum. Money well spent,"I've been a Kenmore canister lover since the mid 1970's. My first one lasted 15 years which is why I kept buying them. Over the years, they seem to last less and less time. I just bought one last week and after 1 spin around the house, I decided to take it back. I wasn't planning on a Dyson, nor was I planning to spend $500 but after the demonstration and hearing the 5 year warranty, I took it home. WOW!!! I've NEVER had a vaccum that works this well. It's easy to manuever, fits under low clearance, quiet, and best of all, picked up my white cats fur in one swoop. OK, so $500 is a bit of cash for a vacuum, but I spent $350 on the Kenmore. For another $150.... I get to enjoy vacuuming.Well worth it folks. Go get one!"
5,Priceless,"The wisdom of Yogananda collected by Amrita foundation. This is not a light book but it is worth looking for a copy. This book seems to be original, without changings and/or additions. What is very interesting is that the size of the book is very small, whilst the new version is much bigger. The question arises spontaneously: Did SRF add material, hearsays, opinions and so on, or did Amrita omit much stuff? buy both versions and discover for yourself..."
3,Not as good as I had hoped for.,I guess I was looking for a miracle but this wasn't it. It did help but I've found that taking individual supplements has worked much better for me than anything else has. Some have complained about the size of the pills but I didn't find that a problem. I think my gullet is above average size though.
2,OK,These are some of the largest pills. they are hard to swallow due to size and texture. they get stick when wet so have a large glass of water when taking them. Do they work? Maybe - there has been not much noticable differance. Will I reorder? No
2,Not great,Haven't noticed that much difference between this and Urinozinc. Very hard to swallow as they are so large I have to crush them and dissolve in water.
5,it works,I bought this for my daddy. He said it works well for him and asked me to buy more for him. I am glad it works.
2,Tried but not effective,"I purchased the product with some of the symptoms the ""product claims"" stated they would alleviate. I know it wasn't a cure but was expecting much better results. The first problem is the pill is so large it's difficult to swallow. The thought of taking it 4x per day would want to make you endure the prostrate problem. I've followed the instructions for 4 weeks but without any positive results. I would not recommend. The value seems good for the cost which is why I rated 2 instead of 1 star and maybe ..... the results will improve over a longer period of testing."
3,Depends on your mood,"If the ""amateurish"" comment meant this was not solve-the-whodunit material, I agree -- it's good bedtime, or escapism, reading. I don't think it should be classified under either Mystery or Suspense.However -- the historical basis combined with modern elements made for an interesting plot. Some good characterization and steady unfolding of the storyline kept my attention until the end, and of course,""Life is too short to read a badly-written book."" ~ T.M."
3,Too boring to finish,"I got about halfway through this book, the third I have read in the series. And it just felt too silly to read the rest. The characters are so cardboard, and the heavy-handed business with the bear. I get tired of large corporations being the enemy, too. Isn't it someone else's turn to be the enemy other than the US government or a large corporation? Davis' dialogue frequently seems dumb. And why is Nick so totally limited? How many believable plots involving finding airplanes can there be?"
5,my first night with you,I just think that she is good looking and i like her voice. And if she can sign like that then i would like it if she can sign and send me her releases that she has had.
5,mya mya mya,I love her music I'm her #1fan she's the best I'd give anything to meet her when I grow I'm goingto be just like her because I sing and dance Mya Keep it real Love Shayna
5,Talented to no Bounds,"Mya is a beautiful girl with an amazing voice. Her debut album is one of my all-time favorites. Other than the fact that it features Sisqo and Silkk The shocker among many talented featured artists on the album, Mya has a grace tht is unmatched. Get this CD as well as her first album, and her new upcoming one."
2,To stretchy all over,"I'm a Wacoal girl, and I found this Lunaire bra just way too stretchy and big. Comfortable, but it looked sloppy on me because the straps couldn't be shortened enough (so I was droopy) and the sides had very little support, so I bulged out over the top of the sides. And the cups seemed to be quite far apart. I am a petite woman, a 34DD, and I think this would be a nice bra on a tall, slim woman. But not on someone like me who needs some shaping and support."
3,Too minimimizing for me,"This is one of the more flattening Lunaire styles I own. The fit is similar to a Lilyette minimizer. It runs a bit small in the cup compared to styles like Aruba or Whimsy. if you're a DDD, you'll likely find this fits more like a DD."
1,Useless,"Being a big fan of the Kenwood major machine, using it several times a week, I have been very disappointed by the Kenwood pasta maker.Why - heres the story :The pasta maker works by forcing pasta dough through a dish containing a number of holes, the shape of the holes determine which pasta you thought you were about to make.The holes are placed vertically as well as horizontically (rows and coloumns).When using the pastamaker, gravity pulls the fresh and slightly wet pasta dough towards earth.On the long and indeed dangerous journey towards earth the pasta emerging from a vertical set of holes collides with pasta emerging from the same vertical set of holes - producing the bubble of dough you put into the machine in the first place - instead of pasta..The pastamaker mey be good for something, but its not making pasta.I believe Kenwood should change the name of this appliance or take it of the market alltogether."
5,caligo has captured me,"Finally - a christian band that is unafraid to step outside of conventional music styles! Caligo is full of unique sounds, from psalms set to contemporary beats, to melodic folk-like ballads, to bouncy danceable tunes...all with a positive message and fresh concepts about spirituality and christianity. never mind the fact that several of the members are friends of mine...this cd is awesome!"
3,A Decent Looking Well Made Plastic PlanterA,This is not a bad planter urn for the money.It is plastic but not junky looking and has a pleasant gray patina. Of course you can always paint it if you like.It's a decent size and pretty nice looking.I have a few of these that I have used for years and they hold up well to the out side weather conditions here in New England.One of the nice features is that they are pretty light and are very easy to move.I have several authentic concrete versions of these and they kinda of blend in.I plan to buy a few more of them.This was shipped in a reasonable amount of time and was well packaged.Dean
5,Great Wheel Cleaner,Very good polish for aluminum wheels and other bare aluminum surfaces. Even works good to remove minor scratches from you car.
1,When The Mountains Tremble,I is very disappointing when you don't receive a product you ordered! I have yet to receive it! I will no longer use your site and will try others to purchase what i need!
1,What if it were true?,"Since this film was released, it has been shown that virtually nothing that Menchu has written about is true. When asked about why she misled so many, she blamed her editor. Fortunately her editor had the tapes of Rigoberta dictating her book. Silence followed.She ran for President of Guatemala last year. The country is more than 60 percent indigenous. She got less than 5 percent of the vote. Only the Noble Peace prize committee, Susan Sarandon and gullible gringos give her any credibility.The movie shows the beauty of the Guatemalan mountains and the people who live there but the movie fails to say why Rios Monte, the notorious killer of indigenous people in the movie, received more votes for President from the indigenous population than Rigoberta.It is a good myth but if you want to understand Guatemala you will have to do your homework. The complicated story of Guatemala and the war will never get the press that the myth has received. Check out the books by David Stoll."
2,"An interesting experiment, but boring story","Though I appreciated and respect that Van Sant tried to create something different here, that alone was not enough. The central problem with the book is that the story line is far too weak. Some of my favorite authors also use a style that jumps around a bit and slowly pieces together a story (e.g., Vonnegut, Dunn, Robbins), yet Pink fails where these authors succeed. Initially, I found the book fun to read because of the varying style, fonts, perspectives, etc., yet quickly became bored with it as I searched in vain for an interesting story line that could be construed as gripping. Nothing of the sort presented itself. If an experimental and loose writing style alone does it for you, than this is a good book to read. If you desire content that will captivate you and sustain your interest, look elsewhere."
2,Is it worth it?,"I initially purchased PINK after seeing on the jacket cover a quote comparing it to Robbins and Vonnegut. Unfortunatley all I found was the style of Robbins without the wit and the essence of Vonnegut but without the closure he provides. I had fun reading it, peeling through Van Sant's veiled references to contemporary pop culture icons Kurt/Courtney/River/Keanu,etc. But was ultimately dissapointed in the lack of ""story"" in this novel. Would I recommend it? Only to a masochist."
1,Race abandoned...,"You know how you check the sports pages in the summer for the Tour de France daily results, and all the riders are listed in order of their time in the previous day's stage? At the end of the list are names followed by the designation ""abandoned race."" That's how it was for me with this book, about 70 pages into it I abandoned it due to lack of entertainment or interest. I like Gus van Sant's movies, I like the book jacket a lot, and I like the little drawings in the book, but as for the actual words... No. The book is a convulated mess, sprinkled with characters loosely based on real people van Sant knew or knows (Kurt Cobain and River Phoenix among them), but none of whom are worth investing any time or energy in. It's really an experimental work at best, and even on that level fails to do anything new or interesting."
3,Less than meets the eyes,The jar I got was half full while the picture used led me to expect it to be filled to the neck of the jar.
1,seller unresponsive,"I have purchased ink roller replacements in the past for our Canon office calcultors, as the ink wears out over time. One of the ink rollers I ordered worked fine- the other had an issue with the red printing extremely light. I e-mailed the company regarding this defective item, but never received an answer. I usually order replacements through national office supply stores, and will in the future."
4,Nu-kote Model NR-42,Worked on my Canon P-26DH III. This is an older model printing adding machine/calculator. I'm glad to see the red ink again.
4,Glowstick Heaven,"This is one of the heavier Ministry of Sound (MOS) compilations I've heard, and that's good news for this serious clubber/raver/glowsticker. Many of the remixes on the first CD are geared towards heavy house and techno; there's almost no straight trance, dub, or chill. Sunlight and Voyager are particularly good for practicing your stick skills. The second CD tones down the mood a little bit, especially as it nears the end, but it's mostly solid house with a heavy dose of West Coast flavor. The flow from beginning to end is smooth, but I would have liked to hear some new mixes--a few singles are straight up. Overall, though, this is an excellent delivery from the MOS folks, and all avenues of clubfolk should enjoy."
3,Don't Bother,"I've been an A.N.I.M.A.L fan for years, though they have never been innovative and tend to sway with whichever style of metal seems to be in the vogue. One strength is their lyrical content which is a cut above some of the immature rantings of their English speaking North American counterparts. I was expecting them to return to their heavier more traditional metal roots but this album is purely new metal, and very poorly done new metal (think Korn in Spanish). I gave it 3 stars because some of the lyrics touched me but I think its time to put nu-metal to rest. Steer clear of this stinker."
1,I do not recommend this book,This is a dirty book. I only got to page 8 before it went bad. I would not give it any stars but 0 stars is not an option. The world is in bad enough shape morally the way it is with out this book. I am ashamed people would write stuff like this.
5,What a gem of a book,"I almost didn't read it because of the previous reviewers review. I'm glad I chose to read it. It was wonderful. It shows how difficult it could be to be married to a superstar baseball player or any superstar. How one can loose oneself. This is a love story nonetheless. How the best friend of the superstar can love the woman married to his best friend. They both loved the same woman. This story stays with you because it is so real, so moving and the characters so human in their flaws and frailties. I highly recommend it."
4,My Official NEW Bathroom Book,And that's a high honor. Picked it up the other day. Full of great Ideas. From places to travel to festivals to my favorite (and I am going to organize this) the Big Wheel Pub Crawl. Awesome stuff. Definitely gave me some things to try and accomplish... like 499 of them.
1,this book is a waste of paper,Unless you are an 18 yo male this is a big disappointmentCannot get rid of it soon enough...one needs a shower after the first chapter.
1,What the heck?,"Don't even waste your time reading this rubbish. Go home instead and watch ""Sex in the City"" reruns. Your time will be better spent..."
2,Eh it's ok stuff you would come up with yourself,"its cool I guess, but it's not all that. But still funny at the same time.I'm 23 and it's whatever for me."
3,Decent but not great,This had some good ideas of stuff to do but its not really an entertaining read.Unless your an alcoholic with an endless bank account your not gonna be able to do half the things in this book.It has some detailed information about vacation party spots around the world but I know for me at least they sound very unrealistic.I would have given a better rating if they said more things inside the country or even that you could do locally.
5,This IS Urban Blues!!!!,"In short, This is Black folks blues. This is where historic taste in Blues started to split culturally. I bought this album on a whim and loved it. I played ""After Hours"" for my 80 year old parents and for the first time I saw them get up and dance. They said this was the ""Negro National Anthem"" back in day. Another older gentleman begged me for a copy. Of course, that is illegal. ;C) Put it on for your Southern grandma or great grandma, step back and watch her work!"
1,never received order!!,I never received this product! When I ordered it said it was in stock to overnight. It took about more than a week before any correspondence saying the no longer had the product I ordered. Now I just keep getting emails wanting me to rate a product a never received. Go figure!!!
2,Worked great... until the 1 year warranty ran out!,"I must admit that when I picked this item up, it just felt like quality. I also admit I didn't look at how long the warranty was but it seemed as though the product already knew! Just 1 month after the warranty expired, the handle stopped engaging to force the rod and compress the tube of caulk. The price I paid for this, I thought I was not only getting comfort and ease of use but I thought I was getting quality. Units I paid $3-5 for 10 years ago from the local hardware store might not be as rugged looking or as comfortable to operate but at least they are still going. This unit was $40 when purchased and lasted 13 months with moderate to light duty use.I would have rated this 1 star but it did work great when it worked. Maybe I got a bad one but I'm rating on my individual experience."
3,Interesting book but writing lacks conviction...,"I enjoyed what this former LAPD officer had to say but found the writing a bit tedious and, well, lacking any real insight. I'm sure he meant well when writing these memoirs and with him personally I have no problem, I just don't think writing is his calling. He should stick to giving speeches, etc."
1,Where was the editor?,"This book is horrible. I don't know what everyone else was reading, but using his wife as his chief editor was the start of the decline of this book. I took this back to Barnes & Noble immediately after I read the first two chapters...the grammar is horrendous and his story is very disinteresting. It sounds like the same ol' BS cop war stories, nothing that people who don't watch a TV show like third watch or CSI couldn't learn. If you really want a good book about the LAPD, read Homicide Special; now that book is worth your while...wake up people!"
4,GREAT,I thought this product was very good. I was going to get this book at barnes and noble brand new for $17.00 then i decided to check on amazon. I payed $0.88 for it!!!!!!
4,Captivating,I found this book impossible to put down. I am currently going to school majoring in Law Enforcement. I truly enjoyed reading his take on being a Police Officer. It gives a first hand look into what they deal with each day they walk their beat. I have great respect and admiration for my local Officers here that I have done ride alongs with as well as Officers nationwide and worldwide. This book shows just how much they put their lives on the line each day. May you all stay safe out there and I can't wait to see you on the streets soon!
5,"it would be a privilege, and an honor, to meet him","tried not to read the other reviews- we all have strong feelings about law enforcement- but i can say for myself, I was so moved by this book that i not only could hardly put it down, i was choked up with emotion several times. Seargent Middleton brings a humanity and the realism of human frailty to the reality of the police force that I think few have ever been able to convey. I find people, in general, take the concept of that profession way too cavalierly, without ever really internalizing the huge and often daunting responsibilities that encompass and define the career of police officers. God bless him, and all others with his altruistic heart- if anyone has a website address for him, I would most appreciative if you would pass it along to me. He is my hero!!!!!!! (and someday, I would be so honored to be able to tell him that!!!)"
2,"Very basic,,,lacks a lot of important details","Middleton means well, of that I am sure. However, he violates the cardinal rule of non-fiction writers by changing many place names into unrecognizable titles. For example, he claims to have worked undercover at a Los Angeles high school in the late 1960's. Why the need to change the name of the school? He changes a lot of street names and other details that make a non-fiction book much more interesting. He also bends way too far over to apologize for all the awful things he did as a young rookie. A lot of true crime/non-fiction readers take great joy into researching sections of the stories they read--they can't do this if the author is vague about details. If you want to learn about L.A.P.D. in the 60's and 70's, this is not the book."
4,She looks so cute with it!,My wife loves this chain and the dragon fly really makes it for her! She looks sexy wearing it too. I love seeing it on her. Dragonflies are her favorite and i was so glad to find one on the belly chain. It's hot!
1,cute but cheap,"This belly chain is really cute, but it broke the first time I tried to put it on. Also, it was advertised as ""one size fits all"" but it was tiny. I'm a size 8 with a small waist and I still had to add about 10 inches of additional chain so that it would fit comfortably above my hips."
3,not what i expected,This is a cute belly chain but its the only one I could find that would really fit me. I don't really like the fact that the design part goes to the back it will take some getting use to.
3,Large print playing cards,"Cards are fine and reasonably priced, but the shipping and handling cost more than the product. So I paid over $11 for one deck of cards that aren't especially attractive."
5,Great,These cards are just a little bit of hope for our Mom who is loosing her vision and give her some enjoyment too. Never thought I would spend so much for a deck of cards but it is worth it.
1,Low Vision Cards,These cards were not helpful for my dad who struggles with low vision. The larger numbers are upside down when you place them in the card holders unless you keep them from overlapping - which is inconvenient for most games. Also the suits are even more difficult to see than a regular playing deck.
5,Fantastic,Bought the playing cards for my ageing parents whose eyesight has diminished over the years. The cards are great and are much easier for them to see. GREAT PRODUCT!
1,Charged too much!,This is a book my daughter required for her studies. The book is priced at $32.95. The price on the book is actually $12.95. Be aware of overpricing!
5,Perfect for Wolverine Fans,"When half time comes, instead of watching commercials, get out the toss game and score for your team."
4,"Not Round Bottom, But Good For A Flat Bottom Wok","Juat a ""heads-up"" for those of you looking for a nice Round Bottom Wok. This wok is listed as ""round bottom"", so I ordered one for use on my gas top stove. I specifically wanted a round bottom wok as I not only believe they cook more evenly, but I have a wok ring to use with it. Amazon suggested I buy a wok ring to go with this wok. When it came, it was FLAT BOTTOM! I was so disappointed, but ordered another (which shipped very quickly, thank you Amazon) and the second one was ALSO FLAT BOTTOM! I returned it, too. I am taking a break from the order-and-return cycle, but hope to shop again here with Amazon. I just won't order the Joyce Chen Round Bottom Wok...although the quality looks superb."
2,Labor intensive to maintain,"This wok cooks OK. The thin material doesn't hold heat like a heavy cast iron wok would, but it gets hot enough, and doesn't weigh a ton either. I found it somewhat difficult to keep it steady on the stove, I suppose it depends on what sort of grates you have. I bought the separate metal ring which improves stability, but it raises the wok a little higher reducing the heat a little. My main gripe is the amount of maintenance needed. I seasoned it according to the instructions, which took a while. After cleaning, I make sure it's completely dry (by reheating it), then let it cool, then coat it with a little mineral oil (vegetable oil can turn rancid). Despite all that, it still rusts. If I don't use it for a few weeks, it gets a light coat of rust which then has to be scrubbed off with a scouring pad, or you'll taste it in the food. Maybe if you use this thing 4 or 5 times a week for a few months it would get so well seasoned the rust problem disappears."
3,6 years tops,I have used this wok for 6 years and now need a new one. The surface deteriorates with constant use over time. We did season properly and followed direction. It does however provide excellent results and it is great for the occassional wok cook. We need something else that won't break down over time.
2,Item was not as advertised,"I ordered a ""new"" product but it did not arrive as advertised. The wok was poorly packaged and not sealed. Upon review there were many dings and scraped in the bowl of the work and the bottom looked as if it had been used previously. There is no way I would accept this as a new item and have since returned it. I am disappointed with the purchase and would not purchase from this seller again as the defects were obvious and there is no way the item could be passed off as ""new""."
3,"Large, but seasoning didn't work well","This is the first time that I had to season a wok appropriately, and I followed the directions exactly. However, either the factory coating didn't come off properly or I somehow didn't do it right, because the surface is rusting, and it makes the food inedible. I will try re-seasoning it, but I am not impressed.Also, the bottom of the wok is flatter than I have experienced, so that even though I have a gas stove and try to rotate it around in the Chinese style in which I love to cook, it still pretty much stays in the same position. I should have just bought a cheaper one at the Chinese store.On the pro side, it is very sturdy and the handles are nice, but it has been much more of a pain than it should have been."
2,Loose handle,Seems fine all around but came with a really loose handle. I haven't figured out a good way to tighten it up yet.
4,"Best classic Wok for the price, but..","Make sure you season it constantly. As another reveiew mentioned, works well with gas cooking like our previous Wok did."
2,Dissapointed and I cant return it,I have used a wok for many years it was perfectly seasoned and I'm familiar with cleaning it properly.However I gave my beloved wok to my mom. This wok came shiny and new I followed the directions to remove the protective finish.After seasoning and re-seasoning the wok it peels in the center.Very unappetizing to eat peeled char.Pass this one up!!
1,Junk,These are the most poorly made tongs I've ever seen. I should have known better because they were very inexpensive. The material is flimzy and they have NO spring in them at all. They are going straight into the thrift shop bag. I will replace with a usable quality that I will purchase at a retail store (so I can try them out). I can't believe that Amazon would make such a cheap product available.
2,loose fit,Simply too loose to work properly on the buckets I had bought. The original loo and seat I had bought were great... even the original lid worked great - unlike this replacement.
5,Zen at it's finest,"Cheri Huber resonates with many who are ready to explore something more than the ""I, me, mine"" and ""more, more, more"" culture in which we live. I have given this book as a gift to at least ten people. The book does not endorse a specific religious doctrine, but explores common sense ways to view the world, and ourselves, through compassionate eyes. Highly recommended."
5,Interesting combination of Buddhist and Psychotherapy ideas,"I found this book to be a good review of the principles of Buddhism and Cognitive Therapy. It is probably a little confusing and vague to someone who is new to either, but I wouldn't know because I have already read a lot about both. I don't know if the author was intentionally borrowing ideas form psychotherapy but it seems likely she was.So this book might be best for people with an intermediate level of experience with meditation, who will benefit from it's inspiring prose. It is written in a beutiful way similar to the works of Alan Watts. If you want to learn more about cognitive therapy, I have read ""Cognitive Therapy: 100 Key Points and Techniques"" and recommend it. It is a technical book, though. A popular book on cognitive therapy is ""Feeling Good"" by Burns, but I haven't read it."
5,Wonderful Help For Everyone,"Anyone who is looking for support, understanding, what life is, how to feel better, etc. will get help reading this or any of the wonderful books Cheri Huber has written!! This book is written in simple straight forward words and pictures that have helped me stop beating myself up and start loving myself. It is a life practice.our heart are one,kris"
5,Great to meditate on,This is a wonderfull little gem f a book filled with witty wisdom and thoughts to ponder for days. I love the font style chosen as it looks like handwriting and I love the authors insight even more. Buy this little book and open your mind to a realm of possibility.
4,Nice unit,"This unit seems a very good value for the price. My wife has been using it regularly to good effect. It appears well made, was not difficult to assemble, and has worked fine."
4,Power Vibe Review,I am very pleased with the Health Mark Power Vibe. It does exactly whatthe maker says it will. My only complaint is that the intensity of theexercise cannot be set before the machine comes on.
1,Not Good,"I ended up returning this machine after trying it out for one day - and returning it was very easy, and at no expense to me (Thank you, Amazon!). I found that the amplitude of the vibration on the Health Mark was very small - so that it felt like I was standing on a large electric razor. It seemed clear to me that this was not going to produce the results I wanted, might even be harmful over time, and I ended up buying the more expensive but far superior machine from aestheticmd - Sorry I can't be at all enthusiastic about the HealthMark."
2,Just don't see what the fuss is about,This machine only vibrates to my knees so I have no idea how it benefits my arms. It is also very loud. I can see using it if one were injured or recovering from some injury (or perhaps my 85 year old mother might find it beneficial.) But it is an expensive machine. There are so many other strengthening programs out there (and machines like reformers) that do a lot more for a lot less. I am just not impressed.
4,Love my Power Vibe,I ordered my own present this year and I could not be happier. Not only does it strengthen ... it relaxes too (on the low speed) Great after running or tennis. I haven't had it long enough to tell you everything but at this point it is doing what I wanted. Now my Mom wants one and it's not on sale!
2,Power Vibe Whole Body Vibration System,"Prior to purchase, I read all of the posted reviews. All but one were favorable. Unfortunately, the unfavorable one was correct. My daughter and I both tried the machine, and agree that it does not live up to the advertising claims."
2,This helped a little,"The book was not organized well at all. It was nice to include the study plans, but they need to match in terms of pages and titles throughout the book. In addition, the online exams were not as difficult as some of the other practice tests that I took. So the book gives a false sense of your score. It is not what I consider a good study book. It was a good thing that I took some other practice tests so that I could compare and contrast."
3,"Sadly, not what I would have hoped for.","I hesitate to comment. As an Orthodox faithful, I purchased this Audio CD set to listen to the scriptures on my daily commute. I did not want the New Testament set to music. Unfortunately, Roscoe Lee Browne reads the New Testament in the most dry, flat, monotone style possible, without an ounce of inflection, emphasis, or even a dramatic pause. Believe me, we Orthodox know something about monotone delivery, but this is VERY dry. Browne does not qualify remotely as ""one of the best actors alive."" Picture David Niven reading Ben Stein's part in ""Ferris Beuller's Day Off"": ""Beuller, Bueller, Bueller..."" You get the idea. The problem with Browne's robotic delivery, is that you have to listen with rapt attention to assemble context; not an easy job in morning traffic. To each his own, but I will recommend a different audio version if asked."
1,Not Impressed,I was disappointed that the ink cartridges were almost dry of ink and barely printed. I expected them to at least be readable on the tape.
4,Welcome to the world of Warhammer,"Warhammer is a universe that is constantly at war. Humans, chaos soldiers, dwarves, elves, ogres, dragons, tyranids, griffons, eldar, daemons, mages, and countless other beings make up this world. Into the Maelstrom is a gritty collection of twelve short stories that are all set in the fantastic universe of Warhammer. The good thing about short stories is that they are straight to the point. There are not any boring paragraphs because most of the stories are less than thirty pages. Each story(except one) kept me entertained and I can't wait to get my hands on another Warhammer novel."
2,Just OK,"Warhammer 40K stories have been more about the setting than the story. It's interesting to see some of the background, but for the money you're better off reading something else."
3,great album! some computer playback issues,Would be 4-stars except for some playback issues. This is more techno/dance oriented than Other Side: New York. I have had some problems playing back on some computers. I tried it on several Macs and Windows PCs. Some systems can play and rip this album fine. Some cannot even mount it. The record label is aware of the problem and has been very responsive to my feedback. Kudos to them for their help!
4,Sure beats a baggie,"Yes, I was using a baggie and a clip to hold incentives when training our pound puppy on his walks. This is a big improvement. My only gripe is that the lining is not attached to the outer shell, so it tends to bunch up. Scout says that's because I need to put in more treats for him. If you have really large hands, you might prefer a larger pouch. But overall I'm happy with this treat tote."
1,Disappointed,"I loved my treat bag first. Seemed good quality and material, it worked well and was convenient to carry treats and train dog. However, when I washed it the first time, the material around the seam came appart. When I washed it the second time, it totally fell appart at the seam and I can't use it anymore. Disappointed."
5,Perfect! But...,"I love this item and I've bought it about 10 times before. It's soft, so easy to wash.Only one thing that I don' like is that I can't choose colour!"
3,I'll keep it BUT..,"I'm not happy about it. I was so excited to get this and that excitement quickly faded as I go to close it with the drawstring and it doesn't close properly. The string inside of it is at the VERY BOTTOM, NOT at the top where it should be. There is no way for me to fix this, so I am not happy about it. I will keep it for training around the house, but it will not work for running- which was my primary reason for getting it. I don't want to deal with returning it and possibly getting another bad one, so I'll keep it."
3,Good size treat bag,This works well holding enough treats for both our dogs. The drawstring helps keep the food from spilling out when you bend over.
3,Cumbersome but ok,"This treat pouch is ok, but I wish it was less cumbersome to open/close. When training or walking a dog, you often only have one hand free. I wish this pouch was able to be opened with one hand. It's possible, but takes quite a while, which defeats the purpose. And if you leave the drawstring open, the treats fall out, so that's not an option."
3,Drawstring slips,"We like the idea of this little pouch, however the drawstring kept slipping down inside the bag causing the pouch pocket to be smaller. I ended up sewing on the pouch a bit to keep the draw string in place.... works great now."
4,webDogTrainer.com review,As a dog trainer I love using these treat bags. It is easy to use and you don't have to fumble to find your treats; this is helpful for proper timing.-Julie the online dog trainer from webDogTrainer.com
5,Great for training.,I use this for agility training and works very well. The clip is sufficient and holds onto my jean pocket well. I would recommend that you buy the large size instead of small because the large is just the right size.
2,Treat Tote,"Didn't work very well for me because the plastic clip isn't very strong, and would fall off. Would probably work better on one's jeans, but it gets cold here, and I had hooked it on my jacket pocket."
4,A true portrayal,"First Born was not what I expected, and did not have in it many things i was led to expect, and yet I sat and watched the entire film, riveted. It draws you in slowly because you really aren't sure what is happening, or why. By the time you realize what the movie is really about its too late to back away. The ending will shock you, and leave you wondering. I found it a true portrayal of an affliction many women suffer from."
4,PPD (Post-Partum Dementia)...,"FIRST BORN suffers from the same problem as William Friedkin's BUG w/ Ashley Judd. It is presented as a supernatural horror movie, when it is clearly not. FIRST BORN is about a new mum named Laura (Elisabeth Shue from Link and Hollow Man) who experiences post-partum psychosis (in Bug it was schizophrenia / paranoia) in a most horrifying, even fatal way. Laura begins her descent soon after her daughter's birth, slowly growing more paranoid / delusional as she becomes convinced of some occultic conspiracy aimed at destroying her family. The first two-thirds leave things a bit open, but the third act leaves no doubt that Laura's troubles should have been taken far more seriously! FIRST BORN is an excellent thriller w/ some horror elements. The finalé is a true grabber!..."
1,Um.... What?,"The first hour of this movie was great! All of the creepy moments, the weird things happening all around her and the clues to what is causing it all.Then it just got stupid. Really, really stupid. I won't spoil the ending, but it just made me mad! What did the diary mean? Who was the girl at the grocery store? What happened to the girl who lived in the house, was she the girl on the bus? What was that doll? What was the thing the nanny hid under the crib? All of the cryptic clues and scary moments equalled absolutly nothing when this movie was over. Not a single question answered.Why even put that stuff in there if you aren't going to use it later?What a waste of time. A psychological thriller this movie is NOT."
2,Could hardly hold my interest.,"Dancer gets pregnant, moves with hubby to isolated new home, has baby, experiences weird circumstances, and hires a strange old babysitter.The good news is that it is fairly well-acted and there is quality direction. Early on, there is at least some tension as we expect the storyline to be revealed, but we're led only to red herrings. The film is just a series of strange events (not scary or creepy) and it's hard to maintain any interest after the first 45 minutes or so. The story goes virtually nowhere, so it's like watching an extended version of a twilight zone episode, only without the satisying ending. Two hours is far too long to invest in this movie."
1,First Born,"Another title written over ""First Born' on cover in black felt tip. Didn't watch it. Gave it to Thrift Store. Waste of my money"
1,World's Worst Mothers Winner,"I suppose the acting was decent, but the movie drove me nuts. From the moment the dog dies to the end of the movie, I couldn't believe how insanely stupid the character of Laura was. Is it actually possible for a mother to be that horrible? I agree with the other reviews that the red herrings were annoying as hell, especially since they left more unanswered questions than anything. The ending was a twist, but a predictable one. Any mother that has ever done what happened at the end of this movie, or something similar, should be shot dead on the spot to save humanity and children around the world."
3,snoozer,"i went into this movie thinking it would be good , but had found myself trying not to stop my dvd player. it's not the acting it just the movie is basicly about nothing."
5,Wonderful book turned movie,"This is a wonderful book! I really loved the pace of the story and how endearing the characters were. This book was turned into a television movie called ""The Beniker Gang"" starring Andrew McCarthy. FANTASTIC film. It was very true to the book and wonderfully acted! I recommend both the book and the movie!!"
4,bitemebitemebitemebitemebitemebitemebitemebitemebitemebiteme,Never have I read such a fantastic book. The people in this book are so determined to be and stay a family. These people broke the law to become a family and to stay a family. It made me remember the love I have for my family.
1,Pathetic design,"I purchased these straps when I was in a lot of pain thinking that its design made sense. The minute I received it and saw it in real life, I knew I had been taken. I never returned it because i lost my receipts and just procrastinated. Its been years since I bought them but I finally took the time to write my review."
2,Much better products available,This item is very poor quality and is uncomfortable. You would do much better going down to your local drug store and purchasing something from the shelf.
2,Try something else instead.,"The idea sounds good; however, its practical application is a way far from perfect. A regular arch support insert that can be purchased nearly everywhere does much better job then this one, not to mention that inserts don't use straps, and therefore, don't hurt the top your feet."
2,Worthless,"I submitted one review to Amazon already, - apparently they must have deemed it too negative to publish?Now they send me an invitation to review, - like i might have changed my opinion, possibly?in short - this item is worthless, IMO...and may even be harmful, IMO.I'm not a doctor or a health professional BUT i am a PF sufferer, and i'm a good observer.....it doesn't work as described, and in my case at least altered my walking locomotion in such a way that added to pain in my ankles and stressed my knees. Not good, not good at all.Message Ends."
1,Don't bother with this!,The theory is great but the product doesn't deliver. I have had something else similar to this product and wore it out because it worked very well and decided to try these. So cheap! The velco straps that go over your foot are thin and very uncomfortable and cling to socks and sheets and come undone. The arch support itself is very unflexible and uncomfortable. Returned them as fast as I could! Don't waste your money!
4,Works well,"Works well to relief plantar fasciitis pain, but does not work with all types of shoes. I ordered this for my husband who has been suffering for the past year. He has an insert, and that has helped minimally. He wears this with his insert in his running shoes and work boots, and loves it."
2,FootSmart Arch Brace,"By itself the FootSmart Arch brace is virtually useless, as it has no real padding at all. I sometimes use it to hold the FootSmart Adjust-to-You arch support in place."
2,Disappointed,Didn't really give any support to my arch and wouldn't stay where it should. Ended up buying something different to use instead.
1,dont bother,this is uncomfortable. even after getting used to it. The straps hurt the instep. It slides. Doesnt stay in shoe or sandal. Its just not enough support. It was a waste of money. It just doesnt work. try the poly gel insert.
4,Big and Little,"We have had this book for quite awhile and it is getting worn from reading it over and over, lifting the doors to see what picture is underneath. Favorite pages for our 18 month old grandson are the ladder page and bug page."
1,Warning: FAKE,"Received Slifer and Ra today as gifts purchased from this seller by a friend; the cards are quite obviously fake, which is probably why they are so cheap. Both have various telltale signs of a fake card, including:-Glossy coating over the entire card.-Card is thinner than real cards, and indentation of the card's name can be seen on the back of the card.-Card text is in an entirely different font.-Card text has typing errors. In this case, Slifer's text is missing spaces after both commas.-The silver hologram in the bottom right corner, while present, is misaligned, indicating a fake.-The card images are slightly blurred and grainy.-The Level Stars are unlike those on a normal Yu-Gi-Oh card, though they are similar enough to appear the same from a distance.DO NOT BUY, you will be wasting your money on a fake card, worthless both in duels and for collections."
5,Excellent Must Have on Environmental Justice,"Dr. Anand's has written an excellent and easy to follow analysis of the complex North-South dimension. She successfully argues that environmental justice provides a good lens to international environmental agreements. She discusses such real problems as the ozone problem, climate change, dumping, etc. The book also provides an insight into who are responsible for the global environmental inequality, what are the power dynamics on the international political scene when it comes to the environment, and a glimpse of what environmental justice may look like. I really liked this book, since I found it extremely useful and the argumentation clear and concise. I would highly recommend this book not only for personal use, but a must have in any Environmental Politics class-room."
4,Killer - 'Immortal' (Mausoleum),"Originally released in 1984, as this was the Belgian metal band's third lp out of a total of four they put out. Tunes here that had me sit up and take notice were the straight-ahead rocker ""Frozen Fire - Burning Ice"" (great guitar riffs), ""Queen Of The Future"", ""Touch Of Evil"" and the awesome sounding ""Liquid Shadows"". I didn't even realize this band may still exist - look on You Tube. Apparently, within the last few years, they had reunited to play festivals in and around Europe. 'Immortal' is twelve hard-hitting tunes that supplies you with an hour's worth of quailty in-your-face heavy metal as so many of us old school fans have come to love. Recommended."
2,Not worth it.,"This travel kit takes too much space. If you would like to connect your Palm V or Vx to two computers, I suggest you either buy another cradle, or pack your cradle. A cradle takes up as much space as this travel kit, and it's better. Remember you can also hot sync through the infrared port if you have a computer with an infrared port, but this drains the batteries a lot."
4,For the traveller,"A necessity for the traveller, it is just a shame that they are not sold separately. Some have said they would just like the hotsync cradle to connect with their laptops. Personally I only need the recharger as I can Hotsync using the infrared capabilities of the Palm (available on the Palm OS 3.3 upgrade) and I plan to do away with the laptop almost completely when the keyboard and modem arrive. But if you are a frequent traveller who spends time away from the office this saves alot of valuable space and weight in your carry-on luggage. It's a must!"
5,Wonderful Space Saver,The travel kit is a great product. Both pieces fit perfectly in the flat pocket of my laptop bag (I leave the travel pouch at home). I leave the charger and the hot sync cable in my bag and I never have to worry about leaving it at home when I'm on the road.
3,Works Well...but at a price!,"I agree with others here. All the components of this kit work very well. I took my Palm Vx to Italy and had no trouble keeping it charged thanks to the adapters. I felt safe doing it with the converter too. I know people who have damaged computer equipment by trying to make do with cheap adapters.The sync cord is great. I use it at work instead of buying another cradle. It would be nice if they sold this separately.In the end, my only problem with this kit is the price. It's a bit much for what you get. I suppose if you travel overseas a lot it'll pay for itself eventually. Occaisional travellers will just have to swallow the cost.Do I hear any third party vendors out there???PS: This would get 4 stars if it were cheaper and 5 stars if you could use the adapter plugs with other things (they're made to be used only with this converter)."
4,"Good product, price so-so","C'mon $50! That annoys me, but a cradle also costs $50 so really i guess it's the same thing, plus you get all the adapters for different countries.I use the product even when i'm not traveling to other countries, but if i'm staying at a friends house or visiting the folks, i'll bring the charger. The sync attachement is good for using other peoples computers to do a quick program download.Since my palm is ESSENTIAL to my life, i find this a very useful product. I am annoyed however, that i can't just buy the american charger piece by itself for say, $15-$20.If you are traveling you will NEED this item."
3,How does the hotsync cable work??,"Being able to recharge the Palm is great, but my kit did not come with instructions. How do you start the hotsync process, since the hotsync cable (unlike the normal nontravel hotsync cradle) does not have a hotsync button??"
1,Additional Info that customers need.,"I am resident in India and own a Palm Vx. The original power supply operated at 110 volts and required a converter as the standard mains voltage in India is 220. The supply is defunct and I need a replacement. The cradle and the com port connectors are okay. I desire that the new power supply should operate at 220 volts. I hope this is what you mean when you say that it is compatible with UK, Eurpoe etc. However my original power supply had a five pin socket that fitted on the back of the serial port connector. The one shown in the picture has a differently shaped output. Will it fit into my existing cradle and serial port connector, or do have to replace those units too?I will be glad to place my order and write a review of the product after getting the desired clarifications."
1,a seemingly good buy..but..,the 1/4 jack plug is a bit narrow.I purchased two of these to connect my studio monitors to my mixer.. I have a large range of 1/4 cables and have never had a problem but the diameter of the 1/4 plug on these cables is simply to small.... they are not a tight fit into the socket and the sound can cut in/out.of course..i had already thrown away the packaging...........sigh
2,Be careful.. Know which one you need - Balanced vs Unbalanced,"I purchased these balanced cables to use with a few wireless mics to connect them to our 32 channel analog mixer. They did not function properly. So I plugged them into another device to see if it was the cable, it did not work correctly. I put them on a cable tester and it came back with intermittent faults. I think I may have recv a bad cable, becasue I also have unbalanced cables from this same Mfg and they are working great."
4,overall a pretty cool book,This book is a good book to read if you want to know more about disabilities. I liked the wide range of people it told about. They are put in order from the year of the persons birth. The downside is that the book can get boring at places telling about organizations for disabled people.
4,Practical approach to diet.,"It seems like a weird think to say, but I enjoyed this diet book. It's a practical, every day approach to dieting that anyone can do."
1,where is my order,I have sent 2 emails asking where my order is. Tomorrow will be one month and I still do not have it NOR have they replied to either of my emails. Very disappointed in the customer service I have gotten.
4,The real diet book,This book shows you how to live and diet with ordinary food. Common sense and smart shopping can really be fun and easy if you follow the guidelines in this book.
5,wonderful,"This is a wonderful tool for making your supermarket a positive place to shop, find healthy choices and to learn new ways to negotiate those tempting food areas. I love the helpful hints for incorporating more healthy choices into your day...adding more fiber, natural sugars in fruits, even some healthy makeovers for those old favorites like smoothies and burritos. My favorites! It's hard to give up some of the fattening foods when you start a new diet, but in this book you will find alternatives to giving up those comfort foods and you'll see some wonderful replacements with delicious flavors and textures you didn't dream of before.You should definately try it! She has found the secret to shopping for food and staying fit forever!"
5,Simply good music,"This album is a must-have for any serious aficionado of quality music. The group (though now disbanded, apparently) has a unique sound and is tremendously talented. The standout track for me is Dancing Under the Acacia Tree but there are no duds on this disc."
4,Smooth Listening with a Kick,"This album contains some of the finest blues hits on a single CD. A DJ was playing this album at one of my favorite clubs, and it truly set the mood for an enjoyable evening. If you love to hear guitars sing like I do, then this album is a must for your collection."
3,Only so-so.,"The mints are average. Really, the best thing was the case.I don't feel I wasted my money, but I wouldn't get them again."
2,unlucky,"if i remember right,""mint"" is written, but the condition of the product is not so good. i don't understand why a condition like that is ""mint""."
1,sadly... this is pretty bad.,"Let me start by saying I love the stuff I've read from John Vorhaus on-line (I think at UltimateBet)... very good, very informative. But this? There is almost nothing useful in this book. I am extremely disappointed and I should have paid more attention to the other reviews. There's some decent advice in there but not much. The last third of the book finally begins to discuss online play in a more meaningful way. Again, I really like what I've read from John online, but this was a waste of money. Just my humble opinion. Even so, based on what I have read from him online, I may even take a look at his other ""Killer Poker"" book. But I will take more stock in the the reviews. BTW - best holdem book PERIOD?.... ""Harrington on Holdem - Vol 1 - Strategic Play"" - Dan Harrington."
1,Could sum up the useful tidbits in less than 10 pages.,"This book was a complete let down for me, you might as well skip to page 187 and suffice it to say that pages 1-186 can be summed up in ""don't play internet poker."" There were a couple useful tidbits of information but I am sure they could all be gleaned from any book on internet poker or any poker book for that matter. Anyone giving this book a good review must be friends with the author is all I can imagine. -- Regards to all, one disappointed reader"
4,Take it for what it's worth,"This book is intended for the amateur poker player that is new to the online poker world. You should know the basics of poker, and have some experience playing for money first.If you are a decent table player and seem to be consistenly losing in the online game, this is what you need to read. He covers online pitfalls that the table player may be unaware of, covers great online tells, and how to exploit them. What to watch for when analyzing a new poker site, and so on.He does over analyze a few concepts, but I believe that is intended to burn it into your brain."
3,"Some good points, but don't expect much","This book is a good read in how it is written...witty and humorous in many occasions. However, if you are looking for a tome of knowledge for online poker play -- this isn't it. Don't get me wrong -- there are some useful nuggets of information here. Just don't expect a reference of material (like Super System, Theory of Poker, etc.) that you can go back to again and again in order to learn some new bit of the game or to gain additional insight or strategy. It is geared more toward getting the reader to become knowledgable of the differences between the online arena and the b&ms (brick & mortars) gamerooms. At $14 for the book, it won't be a waste of money...but be aware about what you are getting -- a witty read on poker in cyberspece, its up and downs, and some ideas and conjecture on what to expect online and how to approach it. (Killer) Tactics and (Crushing) strategy are NOT included."
2,Review Physicology,"I'm a fan of John Vorhaus, but this one isn't his best!I expected some more methodology specifically around technique such as early and late position approaches to areas like tournament play and that is not what the books about.Killer Poker Online is big on overall strategy with an emphasis on online sites ,security and 'tells' in general."
1,Disappointing,"The book is a sham, partly because the title is entirely misleading, partly because the ""advice"" is too general and time consuming to be of any value at all. There are few practical points made. The author takes the opportunity to tout his other book. He has exploited the buyer/reader, in my opinion."
4,A Good Read for Internet Beginners,"If you've never played poker online then I would strongly recommend picking this book up before you log on and start playing. It will help you avoid most pitfalls beginners experience such as loosing your bankroll too early and going on tilt. However, that's about as far as it's going to go in improving your game. If your not a experienced player this should not be the book you are reading, rather start reading books that will help your game such as Theory of Poker and Hold'em Poker, both excellent books for beginners."
4,Very good for beginners,"This book is excellent for beginners and losers on the online poker realm. This book trains, through excercises, a player to evaluate his poker style and make the necessary changes to become a more aggressive, thoughtfull, and dangerous player. It shows you the many pitfalls of online playing, and how to aviod them. I recommed it strongly and i guarentee this book will change your game if you are a beginner and a consistant loser."
2,"Two Good Ideas, But That's All","This book offers two ideas that are useful. One, learn how youropponents play and document it. Two, focus while playing poker onyour computer. These points are over-emphasized ad naseum.Essentially this is a collection of ideas that in theory could be usedwhile playing online. It is not a system of good practices based onthe author's actual experience. It cannot be, because too much isimpractical and contradictory.No advice about how to play a hand is given."
1,Crushing the Internet Game?,"What a disappointment. The title suggests that this book will give great insight into how to have much success playing poker online, then the author states within the first few pages that people can't make money playing online. So why insinuate that you can with the title of this book?In short, this book is a stinker. Anyone with common sense and a little poker knowledge already knows everything this book teaches."
1,Don't waste your time.,"In short, this book contains absolutely no useful information. John Vorhaus complains that there are a pile of online poker sites out there with a pile of players all eager to take your money. Well, it looks like John Vorhaus is eager for some of it too. All he's done is jump on the poker train and he's laughing all the way to the bank. Kudos to you John for bluffing me with your book title. You had me at Crushing . This book will not help you win or provide you with any information to better your playing style. My advice? Use your $20 to buy any other poker book on the market, or deposit it onto a real online poker site to get some real online experience.I have not read John's other Killer Poker books so I cannot comment on them. However, I did read this one and it sucked big time."
2,good for the complete idiot...,"Vorhaus states several times that this book is not for the beginner, yet the only good advice contained in these pages is beginner material. All of the mental preparation stuff is good, all of the advice on booking is good, some of the ideas about playing a tight game are good, but the solutions proposed by the author are things that even the most humble online regular knows.Aside from that, there are some really disturbing cop-outs. For example Vorhaus admits that there are online casinos which have simply robbed players of their money, but he won't tell us which ones they are because he wants us to ""do our homework"". What a joke. Let me get this straight, the book is all about how to make money by ""Crushing the Internet Game"" yet deliberately won't tell us which online sites are the con-artists? Give me a break.This book will be useful to some that struggle with the mental unpreparedness of online poker, but aside from that it's a real rag. Look elsewhere."
1,cheap piece of junk,"Do not order this based on the picture or description - the one I received is a cheap stretchy band, not adjustable like shown in the picture. Luckily since this is fufilled by Amazon, I can return for a refund and not have to pay for shipping since I did not get what I ordered.Edit: the picture has been corrected"
2,Embryonic Tower of Power-The garage band years,"As a drummer, the most interesting thing about this recording is how David Garibaldi's style evolved from the way he played on East Bay Grease to later recordings (In the Slot and Back to Oakland, for example). He progressed from a great drummer to a deity in a period of a couple years. The songs on East Bay Grease are, at times, barely up to the standards of your average garage band--though the playing is substantially better. If this was Tower of Power's legacy, they would have been forgotten 30 years ago."
2,Very Mediocre,"I bought this to hear the original version of ""Knock Yourself Out"". I was somewhat surprised by it. The great David Garibaldi (drums) does not sound like himself--the tempo change is obvious to even the non-drummer. ""Social Lubrication"" is just ridiculous. Disappointing, perhaps they should have kept this one locked up in the vaults."
1,won't transfer,"These receipts are a nice size and have a nice format, but the ink won't transfer at all onto the carbon. This flaw essentially renders them useless since the whole point is to provide a receipt to your customers."
5,adam f tries his hand at hip hop,ive been listening to adam f fer about 5 years now . fluently keepin up witht he drum n bass scene and i had noticed thati hadnt seen adam f the genious behind f jam recordings and the phenominal album colours hadnt been puttin anything out . I come to hear hes producin a hip hop album and went off my rockers . i got this album a few months ago and it still impresses me . Tracks like stand clear and smash sumthin set the tone fer a great album . the only thing i dint like was the song with lil mo . shes horrible and its a little bit too poppie for my tastes . All in all its a great album . Hold tight for the smashin remix of stand clear
5,Chaco Canyon,This is a great video that explores indepth this mystery. The music is exceptional in enhancing the mood.
1,horrible. i want my money back!!,"Cheapest quality junk I've ever seen. After I installed it properly. It leaks oil all over in my car. The face is broken loose and wiggles around, and it makes an annoying noise along with my rpms when oil psi builds. I want a refund i did not pay for garbage."
4,Nice heavy flatware,"I really like the quality of this flatware. It is beautiful, and just as pictured - except for one thing. You can't tell in the picture just how large these pieces are. The teaspoons hold two teaspoons, and the large spoons seem more serving spoon sized. Even so, I would purchase this nicely styled set again."
4,Great Looking and Practical for Everyday Use,"I purchased two flatware sets and one hostess set. I also recently received sets of spreaders, mini-spoons, and cocktail forks from my best friend for my birthday. I am totally pleased with quality and styling of these items. They are practical and sturdy and arrived in near-great condition. One item in both a flatware set and hostess set was loose within the general packaging when it arrived, causing slight scuffing and scratches. Otherwise, I found the sets pristine and very attractive."
4,Tableware,"This flatware is absolutely great...nice and heavy, sturdy and has its own distinct look which I love. I am unable to use it in the dishwasher even though it is listed as dishwasher safe. Little rust spots appear after being washed in the dishwasher so I do them by hand."
5,Very pleasantly surprised!,"After doing a lot of research on non-traditional styled flatware, we were drawn to this set. Totally happy with what we received - very substantial in size and weight. We ordered the mini-spoon set as well so our 4 year old daughter would have matching utensils as well. Look at Gourmet Setting's website and that will give you some good background on what they produce.Highly recommend this set!"
3,Did not meet expectation,I bought this set reading all the reviews. But the pieces are more decorative than functional. The pictures in the add look much better that the actual pieces. The package did arrive on time and there were no issues in delivery.
5,Pioneer HTP-3600 Home Theater System,"We are extremely satisfied with the product. The description of the 1000 home theater system seemed just what we wanted, and it has far exceeded our expectations. It was delivered in less time than we expected, and everything was perfect, right out of the box. Highly recommended!"
3,"A nice documentary, but choppy on the music and dance","I just saw them perform live last night and picked up this DVD to take home and share with my son. I was very disappointed there wasn't more uncut footage of them singing and dancing! The interviews were nice, but almost no song segments were longer than a couple of minutes...very frustrating!!!"
2,ladysmith black mombazo documentary,"Okay as far as documentaries go! IF YOU WANT TO KNOW THE BACKGROUND TO THE COMING OF AGE TO AFRICAN MUSIC AND ITS STRUGGLES UNDER THE OPPRESSIVE POLITICAL WORLD OF THE DARK CONTINENT BEFORE IT FINALLY GAINED A DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT, THEN THIS IS FOR YOU! Myself, I'd have liked more music, perhaps an option: music or narrative. Paul Simon opened the can that brought this beautiful music to the world's attention. Learn all about it."
4,"This is an surprising, yet alright album","First off, this album really surprised me because it is a pretty solid album. I think it is low for Tha Realest and Topp Dogg to sound EXACTLY like Tupac and Snoop, but their songs are pretty tight. I like ""Gotta Love Gangstas"" and that other song with Mac-Shawn and E-40. I think this is a better album than "" Too Gangsta For Radio"", because this dosen't waist too much time dissing other more successful rappers like Dre. But the best songs on this entire album are Tupac's hands down. ""Late Night"" just took over the whole album in terms of being a well produced track. ""Mr. Officer"" is cool also but I couldn't stand to hear Michel'le's annoying voice when she dosen't sing. If you are tired of cheaply produced No Limit-like songs then this solid album is for you, but if you don't want to hear the style- biting that this album has, then you might want to look elsewhere."
1,Garbage,"Somebody bought me this album by accident, when I asked for Chronic 2001. I shouldnt've of even taken it out of the shrink wrap. This is a pathetic attempt to make Death Row's prescence felt. It's obvious that by this point in Death Row's history, they are having a hard time getting another hit. There's some hardcore verses from Daz DIllinger, Kurupt, and Soopafly and a couple of Pac songs that are alright, but mediocre lyricists like ""Tha Reelest"" and ""Mac-Shawn"" make this album a bomb. I'm not feeling this record."
4,Santa's Favorite cookies book and plate boxed set,"I was very disappointed that I did not receive a plate with the cookie book. The was the wording of the item's description was very deceiving. I assumed when I ordered the item, I would also receive a plate. I e-mailed the vendor and received no answer."
1,stinky socks,I wore these once and got a huge hole in the toe. Should not happen at nearly $6 a pair and a logo of GOLD TOE!
5,best of series,Give it 5 Stars because it is the best of the trilogy series. The ending in Israel especially moves you!
5,Absolutely LOVED it,I chose this DVD because I had heard such great things about it from friends and I was not disappointed!! This is such an inspiring documentary to watch! My husband and I have watched it over and over and never grow tired of it. Very satisfied with this purchase!
5,Filming God,"Come out of your box, come out of your church, come out of your denomination and behold the wondrous works of God! This film is truly life-transforming as Darren Wilson and his team take you on a journey across the world to witness first-hand the goodness and love of God the Father, and how He radically touches His children. Life changing! If you can, get the Deluxe Edition (which I own) which is 4 discs, 3 of which contain over 8 hours of footage not seen in in the film. This film is so POWERFUL and you will not be the same after viewing it."
3,excellent...but......,"this (2) items came to me in ""perfect"" condition - however the delivery time was almost 21 days - a bit long for an ""in stock"" item.other than that - no problem..."
5,It IS the Very Best of Otis !!,"How do you like your soul? Haunting and mournful? Otis does that - in Pain in My Heart and I've Been Loving You Too Long. Do you like it raw and powerful? Otis does that in Respect and Satisfaction. Love songs? Try My Lover's Prayer. When I first looked at the CD - I wondered why Dock of the Bay was not the last song. It just seemed fitting that the CD would close with Otis' posthumous hit. But I've Got Dreams to Remember serves, in my opinion, as a more apt closing track. We've got Otis to remember - and this CD does a great job of helping people discover and/or rediscover a remarkable talent."
5,How much more do you need?,"Who could say ANYTHING bad about Otis Redding? He is fabulous! I love ""best of"" cds because you get all the good stuff on one cd. I LOVE listening to this cd at work, at home, anywhere! It seems to have this calming effect... LOVE IT! Buy it!"
1,"Very upset, and dissapointed","Unfortunate I orderd this cd, andreceived an empty case I would suggest that anyone making a purchase not. Because I wasripped off, now I ask for the cd I purchased thank u."
5,Good 'ole' Otis,"I have always loved Otis' music. I was thrilled to get this CD! It brings back many memories, and naturally it's a keeper!"
5,Otis at his best,"I have always liked Otis Redding. When I listened to the sample tracks on Amazon, I knew that I had to have this CD. It is timeless and I can listen to it and Al Green, over and over. Buy it."
4,Otis.. what to say.. what to say..,"Otis could sing like nobody's business. ""Sittin on the dock of the bay"" is my favorite song, the only song that can get my to cry. The emotion he puts into songs, and lyrics, gets to your soul like no1 else ever could. Genius."
5,"If you need a soul infusion, this the ultimate plasma","The first question has to be ""How have you gone so long without these tracks?"" There are so many great numbers here that you will never regret having this for the c.d. player or edited down on your ipod. I keep the hits for a good workout on the 'pod for the gym.One of my big regrets in life is not going to see Otis when he was passing through as the opening act for the Hollies a short while before he died. I was smart enough to pick up this cd, so I could have Otis to listen to when I needed him. Just go ahead and buy this. You get all the hits, plus a few extras to just make you realize what a musical treasure Otis Redding will always be."
5,Great output,"I bought this to be used in my epson 3880. With the right colour profile, The printed images makes customers come back again and again."
3,Its Just Okay,"I ordered this for my Vector Image making and printing class. I had no idea what the end result difference was between matte, luster, or glossy paper would be like so I went with matte assuming it would give me a sharper print out. Turns out its not as sharp of an image as I would like it to be, looks a little dull in colors if you ask me, should've figured since its the cheaper one. I would recommend using luster if you want that nice quality but not high on gloss as glossy paper might be."
3,"Great paper, but shipping problems","Good paper for creating posters that I sell. Excellent color and takes lamination well.My only problem is that Epson stopped using bubble wrap to ship their paper. Now they just place the paper boxes inside the shipping box with some poly bags on top. The boxes get bounced around and the corners get bent. Such a pain to try and flatten out these bends. If you do not, the bends hit the printer heads and smear the ink. Wish Epson would take more care in shipping their supplies."
2,Just okay,"I used this for a 19"" monitor, worked okay. Problem is there is no rotational adjustment, just the swivel. that means you have to be perfect when you mount it as far as vertical alignment. If you're off by a just a couple degrees, there's no way to adjust it. Sounds minor, but after a while that slight tilt will seriously annoy you.I used it for several months...monitor's back on the stand now."
2,Best value on the market for this product,I looked at many LCD TV mounts up to $200 and found that this model offered what I wanted at a substancialy less price. The mount was easy to install and the instructions were well written. The mount lined up to the mounting holes on my LCD TV and the unit does everthing the expesive models claimed.
5,Awesome,I loved that it had the Chrysanthemum video but also has other videos. It lets my classroom children see the book in a different format. It was awesome!!!
2,Bob's Review,"The Cox North American 41004 Chilton Mechanical Advantage Caulking Gun is just ok. The caulking tube is hard to remove when the tube is empty. I paid good money for this product , I did not get my money's worth."
1,Not worth it,These guns are not worth the money. They run all over the place when not in use.If you want a better gun for 1/2 the price go with a dripless.
4,"Superb collection of the roots of the neo ""swing"" movement","This excellentCD presents a superb 15-year cross-section of an underappreciated branch of the blues. ""Jump"" blues seems to answer the never-posed question, where does swing end and the blues begin? For that matter, add rockabilly and electric blues, go way back to the late forties, and you have performances infinitely more powerful than Bill Haley and Jerry Lee Lewis. These artists suddenly seem embarrassingly derivative--especially when you hear the original Big Mama Thornton version of Hound Dog. You'll wish you'd never heard of Elvis."
3,A good starting point.,The instructions are horrible. The product is okay. It feels nice but the ends are a bit harsh on the scalp. May not be used very long before uncomfortable enough to stop. Scalp stings for awhile after use.
2,Wizard? No way,"Didn't like it at all, the tongs are too thick and you have to bend each one to fit. Tongs were much to long for out heads. Not using it at all."
5,The book that helped me conquer depression,"This book caused me to think differently about depression, my experience of it, and what to do about it. Using the precepts, I was able to pass through chronic depression and move on to living fully again. Whenever I loan the book, it never returns. It's so good that you don't want to let go of it once you have it."
3,"connection too tight, pulled off housing","I have four of theHosa Cable STX100M 1/4 TRS to XLR Male Cable - 5 Footand two of theHosa Cable STX105F 1/4 TRS to XLR3 Female Cable - 5 Footand swap the cables out regularly to switch which sound card is connected to the monitors. The connection between M and F cables on one set is too tight, which indicates the relatively poor workmanship. As a result, the housing pulls of the F side and the guts of the F connector stay stuck to the M connector on that set of cables. They sound fine on my studio monitors though, and they are inexpensive so I am just ordering another set of two each in the hopes that the next ones will connect with no problems."
4,I now feel armed with information,"After a miscarriage during my first pregancy, I felt I needed answers. Even though there is rarely a known cause for a miscarriage, I feel better knowing there are steps I can take to make sure everything is being done for me that can possibly be done. I may never need to concern myself with another miscarriage again, but just having some knowledge is very powerful and has given me hope. It was very healing for me to know I now have ""knowledge power"" when everything else seems so out of my hands. I also plan to share this book with anyone brave enough to speak about their miscarriage. Unless you've gone through it, you don't know how it turns your life upside down. I'm glad there are good books out there on this often ""hush hush"" subject."
3,It's a start...,"The book is older (which is stated in the informational section), and it was a so-so read for me. I've recently gone through miscarriage, and the book did provide some valuable information on miscarriage in general and on the grieving process (but nothing that I haven't already seen online on websites about pregnancy loss and grieving)."
4,just what I am looking for; looks like a quality product,"Somehow my front seat and its pedastal have gone missing. I would hate to think that I didn't properyly store it in the boat before hitting the highway, but that is the most likely answer.I have a 95 Ranger Sport which seems to have more than its share of uniqueness from other Ranger boats.The hole in the deck in which the pedastal is inserted is a very tight 3/4"".I was able to find a 3/4"" adjustable pedastal, a plate to a attach pedastal to the seat and a very good quality seat on your website.I was very pleased to find the full set of items from one dealer; it will hopefully make my life easier if I accidently ordered a set of incompatable parts."
3,202 services you can sell,"The book was ok and I wouldnt give it 5 stars, maybe 3. It had the same old expected services. none that were really interesting or different. But if you have no idea were to start I guess it is a good beginning."
5,The best small business start-up ideas,"202 Services is the best book that I have read on starting small businesses. Not only does it provides profitable small business ideas,it details the resources on the industry. Moreover, it tells you exactly how much money you will need to get started, what equipment and supplies are needed and what to exact of the business. This book has value!"
1,Suspicious,"The two reviews of this book done by a person has done only one review on Amazon,ever, the review for this book. The reviews also have the same style of writing. Now the reviewer, possibly the writer, may enter more reviews, but, I bet, they will all come after the date of my review. I purchase books based on star rating, but beware when all the reviews from a book are from a vague person or persons who haven't reviewed any other books. I haven't read the book yet, so feel free to remove my review, but first check the identity of the other reviewers."
1,Lost Opportunity!,"The one book by this author was really good and i was looking forward to reading this one, however, the bookseller was quick to inform me that it was out of stock and gave a refund... i would definitely use them again!!"
3,Personal Massager does the trick,"It gets the trick done. Sometimes the vibration is too intense/uncomfortable. The plastic isn't flexible like the jelly toys, so don't expect it to move with you.The battery shaft gets too hot if used for too long. Also, the on/off knob shorts out; leaving you with intense vibration, or no vibration.All in all, not bad at all for the price."
2,Eh...,"It didn't do anything for my G-spot, but it works very well as a citoral vibrator. It gets two stars since I already have enough of those."
1,How misleading!,I bought this book for my 1999 Honda. What a waste of money. There isn't anything on my car. It claimed to have diagnostics. All there is is some trouble code listings. No diagnostics at all. NOTHING for my Honda except how much oil it takes. How can I get my money back?
1,I WAS SHOCKED!!!!,"Got my new "" SHOP EDITION"" Chilton book. What a joke. No Fuel Injection Diagnostics, No ABS Diagnostics, No Emission or Driveability Diagnostics, No Leveling Control Diagnostics, No Cruise Control Diagnostics, No Cooling Fan Diagnostics, No Traction Control Diagnostics, No Steering Column Exploded Views, No Dash Guage Diagnostics, No Diagnostic Flow Charts, No Ignition Troubleshooting Charts. I guess a ""Shop"" doesn't need this information, Unless of course this is really a book for backyard mechanics with a professional price."
1,Geared for the professional technician?,"It couldn't be further from the truth! There is no information in this book for a pro. No specific diagnostic information no ABS, Fuel Injection or anything a pro would want. The price is ridiculous for a 1400 page book. Didn't the last edition of this book have far more pages for about $19.95?"
2,Actron voltage tester,"I thought this item was the same product I had purchased at RadioShack a few years ago. I wanted employees that worked on trailers to have a tool like this to check voltage on trailer wire harnesses when lights failed to work without disassembling the wiring plug or lights. This tool is not as compact as the RadioShack model and although it lists continuity testing as a feature of the tool, it does not have it's own battery to power a continuity test, (again the RadioShack model does). The wire probe does not center itself on the wire as well either. The probe is too loose and can move off to one side of the wire or the other without piercing into the copper conductor. It's okay, just not as good as the tool I own and not as good as I had hoped for."
5,Works well,5 foot long TRS to XLR cable that works perfectly. I used it to connect a studio monitor to an audio interface.
5,Ace Blades Recommended,"Package of 5 Ace Portable Circular Saw Cutt Off Blades were shipped on a timely basis and were as advertised. The blades were used for cutting 4 1/2"" X 9"" X 3"" bricks in laying a brick patio. The blades cut cleanly using a Skill Saw."
5,Fantastic book for preschoolers!,"All 3 of my young children love this book! Its rhythmic story, great illustrations and even little songs make it a favorite for our whole family. Its one they love to have read to them time and time again. Wish I could find it at major bookstores so I could give it as a gift more often."
5,absolutly the best,"My 3 1/2 year old son, knows every word of this book and loves it, This is a great book."
4,Citadel Run book review,Very enjoyable book to read....author is reminiscent of Joseph Wambaugh's writing style...humor and pathos...kept my attention to the end...recommended reading for all who enjoy the police sense of humor....
1,Instrumental not Vocal,"This CD is really a disappointment. I'm a fan of Katie Melua and I have four of her CDs. When browsing Amazon and finding this Katie Melua ""tribute"" album I decided it was worth a try. The site did not list who were the ""Various Artists"" but I decided to buy it and see.Upon receiving the CD, it was only after opening the case (and thus not being able to return it) that I found it was a studio recording of instrumental versions of Katie's songs, not vocals. I would have returned the CD if I had not already opened it."
3,what to do,"Basically dried bread slices. I did try to make Bruschetta with these, but you have to eat them very quickly or they get soggy. They are olive flavored, but don't have much olives in them. I'm not sure what I'll do with these. It's a lot of dried bread. They would be good with cheese and crackers or soup."
4,Pure Melodic Pleasure,"First solo album by Eric after his break-up with the Raspberries. After practically inventing ""Power Pop"" with the Raspberries (Rock and Roll Hall of Fame?) Carmen proves that he can switch from guitar to piano and write some of the best love songs ever. In fact, the only good thing about experiencing breaking-ups in Jr. High was that I could put this album on and have my teen angst readily expressed in song. Instant classics like ""All By Myself"" and ""Never Gonna Fall in Love Again"" show Carmen is as influenced by Rachmaninoff as he was by McCartney in his days with the 'berries. You may remember one of the cuts ""That's Rock and Roll"" as a song that launched Shawn Cassidy's career. There are millions of Eric Carmen fans. If your not you will be after you here this. This is pure melodic pleasure and easily Eric Carmen's best solo album."
4,Longarm and The Redhead's Ransom,One of the better written episodes in the past year. Showed intriguing plot with excellent descriptions of countryside and characters. Looks like Evans had input into this episode.
1,Longarm and The Mustang Maiden,"Very poor quality of plot. Staff writer should have researched amnesia prior to having script approval. Out of 255 volumes this was the only one that no other character referred to title character as 'Longarm'. The fact that this episode began in Nevada, and had no scenes take place in Denver or the Office of Billy Vail shows how this particular staff writer was unfamiliar with supporting characters. There was a lack of detailed descriptions, and a lack of validity in some areas of the book. How can 2 men, one with a bullet in his shoulder possibly herd 600 head of cattle. Evans should school his staff writers better, making sure they are familiar with the characters. It was evident this book was put together without much imagination."
4,cool stuff,"Hello all, I have just learned of their stuff (via a link on another band site)and its frigin good. The changes, dinamics, and melodies are a cool change from what i hear now a days. keep up the good work and when are u comming to the bay area?"
5,Hot and Nasty,This was my first concert back in 1973. I got this for my husband for Christmas so he could remember that concert. Great music from the 70's.
3,Great only because they don't have BOA original,"Its way too bad they have so many of their albusm and don't have their best one. BOA which is where Lord have mercy came from...Only reason to get this CD is to have the cuts from that album (Uncle Lijah. Lord, Hot N nasty and When Electricity...). If you can move these cuts to private collection of good cuts, then get this CD. If you have to listen to whole thing, then it's a pass. Would be 1 star if I wasn't able to transplant these cuts."
1,"Cancel this order, Cancel this Order, CANCEL THIS ORDER","I ordered this CD through an Amazon seller, but somehow the order is being shipped by Amazon. I don't want to pay twice as much for it and the Website won't let me cancel the order even thought it is still being prepared to ship. Please cancel the order. Or else it will be returned unopened!"
4,Black Oak was neat,"The greatest musicians they were not, but just the same, you had to love these guys. I saw them live probably three times in Charleston, SC, and they were always up and ready to rock and roll. One night after one of their shows we saw their bus outside this diner in downtown Charleston and we went in and found them all eating chili. We told them we loved the show and they invited us to eat with them. So, one of my great memories of being a teenager is sitting in an old run down diner eating chili with Jim Dandy and the boys. What a hoot!"
2,should have stated that the pages were written on,wouldnt recommend a used book and they should have said it was a used library book.But the book is not available anywhere only on internet.
2,Not as advertised,"Book was listed like new however it was far from it. Many pages had tears, marks, and food on them. Pretty disappointed."
4,test kit,Power Probe is a simple circuit tester very good design and easy to use. My only wish is the tool be made more inntuitive
5,Excellent product,"This is one of the best product in the market for technicians. It save time and make more money in your bucket, it make you save time the troubleshooting electrical accesories in your cars."
4,Great Product..,"Great product, I seen it advertised on Spike during Power Block TV on the weekends. I said let me give it a try and it turns out to be really nice. I especially like the nice long cord especially when the battery is in the trunk and you need to run back up front to check something.."
5,Power Probe 3,"I have purchased all three generations of Power Probe. They just keep getting better. Thank you for a great tool, Danny"
3,incomplete,My package did not come with the cigarette lighter connector. The picture shows the connector but it didn't come whit it.
2,Overpriced,I purchased this power probe after seeing it advertised on Two Guys Garage. I would not order this if I had of known how simplistic and overpriced this was. It does work as described but is extremely overpriced for the technology.
5,You need this without a doubt.,"Great kit for one preson trouble shooting. Once you figure out the different ways to use it, you will wonder how you got along without it."
4,Power Probe III,The quality is very good and ease of use and understanding the instructions are very straight forward. Well worth it's value for troubleshooting electrical problems in cars or boats.
3,what's new?,"has little new for any reporter who has covered the United Nations...may be margianlly informative to those who know little about the world body.....Comments by Tom Brokaw way off base...fact is the last time Brokaw appeared at the UN George Washington was president....so his comments have little value.....it is a shame that a more extensive review of the UN and its history,mission and operations are not available"
2,huh?,who is this womam? never heard of her.....Tom Brokaw recommends it?has he even read it? anyone in TV knows Brokaw can't read....this book is boring....has no pictures.....at least it could have included vouchers for free tickets on the tour of UN headquarters.... I have one use for this book.....I will use the pages to line my parrot's cage
3,Informative but biased,"Fasulo's book is a great source of information for those who need an introduction to the United Nations' structure and main bodies. However, do not expect an unbiased account from the author, since it appears that the book was partially funded by the United Nations. Regardless, as a journalist who has been covering the UN for so long, Fasulo definitely has a clear agenda: to portray the UN as a valid and necessary institution. Any criticism is likely to be directed toward trivial aspects of the organization, such as the building it occupies or the miniscule offices reserved for journalists. Nothing that suggests a need for substantial structural reform within the UN. Fasulo goes out of her way to praise Kofi Annan and his Swedish wife. The author's devotion to the secretary general gets to be a little bit much and after a while one starts to wonder if it is a bigger office she is really after."
2,"Horribly biased towards the United States, but does, sometimes, offer some useful information.","Though initially overjoyed at finding a book which I thought would give me a balanced account of the UN with which to supplemant my knowledge, after reading the first thrity pages my joy changed to regret for buying this book. With chapter labels such as ""The American Ambassadors"" and with phrases such as ""The UN cannot succed if the US does not support it"",""A strong coherant US lead at the UN is nearly always followed by UN member states"",""Yet, can we ignore it?"" (""It"" being the UN, and ""we"" being Americans, with Mrs. Fasulo ungraciously asumming that the readers of her books with inevitably be Americans), and ""I'm struck by how relevant the work that i've had to do at the UN has ben to the US national security and foreing policy agenda""(quoting John Negroponte), this book generally ignores anything non-American. Try another book if you'd prefer a more international and balanced account of the UN."
5,Educational and Entertaining!,"I bought this for my twin 4 year olds and my 2 year old... they were captivated and so was I! Great for kids of all ages - funny, and fun, and yet gives a ton of Deep Sea info. I highly recommend it."
4,Great for beginning collectors,"Although you can get nicer penny collection books, this one is GREAT for getting organized and starting out.Especially if you are unsure about your new hobby and don't want to invest a lot of money in it yet, this is an easy way to start learning.My 6 yr old son collects coins and this has been a great resource for him to keep straight what he has so far. I highly reccommend this folder!"
4,"Lincoln Cents Folder #1, 1909-1940","It is a great place to store my pennies in Lincoln Cents Folder #1, 1909-1940. That all. what more do U want."
3,good,"I used this product to store the pennies I took effort to collect, and it was fun. Now I have given the product and enclosed pennies away and am satisfied with the project it involved. - Dave Chiddix"
1,not pleased,i got this and everthing looked good until i looked at it more it was pre damaged before it got to my pobox someone busted multiple coin hole out and it continues through the whole folder so i cant use a whole row of slots because of it not pleased. status:used very good
2,Dissapointing in an apartment.,"Purchased this item for apartment shower and even with the flow restrictor removed, only the rain shower function works acceptably. The other functions require much more water pressure than we have, and the ensuing water stream can best be described as ""flacid"". Don't have this problem with the water-pick shower heads! But I am not returning it as it is a great example of Theory vs. Reality and it is a conversation piece. In Brushed Stainless it was about $300 at a local plumbing fixture store, so I now have a very expensive, and very well-made shower head, that does not work very well! and I don't think its broken.

3,"If all you need is a camera case,...","then this might be for you. I received this as a freebee with my QTsi. You can store your camera in it, and that's about it. The mesh pockets are too small for anything other than a filterr two (in small protective cases), a roll of film and batteries. I upgraded immediately, but I also needed the space for accessories I needed. If you want to store a camera, this will do it. Don't count on much space left over, however."
1,1999 audi a6 avant wagon quattro,this item doesnt work for the 1999 audi a6 avant wagon. Waste of time and money. Please do not buy if you have this car because it will not work
3,Did not work for long,Not sure if it is too cold out there or the wind affected it but the heater could not keep up with out pond and the NE winters.
5,Pond Heater,The seller responded to my purchase by packaging the heater very well and shippinf quickly. Will buy again if I have need of item sold by them.
2,Not so great,"This heater only performed for about two weeks in the Cleveland, OH winter before becoming a pond brick encased in ice. Just leaving an aeration pump running works much better."
1,not good enough,"I've had 2 of these and neither lasted more than 2 seasons. Both leaked and tripped the GFCI. I would consider them again for about $8-$10 but not $28-$35. While they were working they kept a hole of about 8""-12"" open all winter. This was sufficient to keep the fish alive. I'll need to find something either cheaper with a decent warranty, or more expensive with a proven track record."
1,Do not buy,"I actually read previous reviews but, still went ahead and bought this. What a mistake that was.I live in eastern North Carolina so we do not get too many days/nights of freezing temperatures. However, we also have a fish pond with Koi in it. We were forecasted to have some freezing nights after Christmas so, my wife and I decided to buy this De Icer to keep any gasses from building in the pond if it did freeze over.It arrived as scheduled. We followed all instructions""to the letter"" and set it in our pond.It worked the first night and the second.The temperature then rose so, we switched it off.About 5 days later we were again forecasted for a freeze and we switched the de-icer back on. and absolutely nothing happened.The reviews I had read all said similar things and I assumed that those folks probably did not follow the instructions. Well, we absolutely followed them and it still only lasted for 2 nights (one freeze event).Never again...."
1,Don't buy this one,"I have bought 3 of these. Worked well the first year. Die the second year. Trip the GFI on a dedicated line. I followed all the instructions. Cleaned, cold tested, stored in a safe place, made a wind break, and still only good the first year. Bought a different brand this year, and will review the new one that was highly rated next year. Thank all of you who have taken the time to review! I am not alone."
1,"If it was sealed properly, it might be ok","We bought this unit in 2008 for our KOI pond. It worked for about a week, and then tripped the GFCI because water was getting inside the unit. The pond froze over completely, and when it tripped the GFCI it also cut power to the pump and the pipes from the pump to the filter froze.Over the Summer, I tried to seal the area around the power cord and the heating element, but that only lasted about a week this winter. The unit again tripped the GFCI, stopping the pump, freezing the pipes, etc.. This time we lost a bunch of KOI. Not very happy at all.Do not buy this unit."
3,Good for about one season,"Low quality item. Worked fine first season. Then quickly took on water second season sank to the bottom where it not only wouldn't de-ice surface, but risked disturbing fragile hibernating amphibians. Ergo, needs to be watched closely for this kind of failure.If you don't mind the prospect of yearly replacement, may be a viable option."
1,Floating pond heater,I was glad to find this because my local Wild Birds had quit carrying it. I had had two fail (GFI trip)previously. The newest one ordered through Amazon failed after a couple of months. I was using it to deice a small preformed outdoor fish pond. I do not recommend this based on three failure in the last several years. I now use an aquarium air pump which is in the garage. I run a 40 foot airline to the pond and let the bubbles keep a hole in the ice. We are in garden zone 6 so this may not work for you.
1,BEWARE of Amazon's third party sales,"I ordered this item because of its great reviews, but unfortunately never received it. This is not a review of the product, but of Amazon's poor customer support when it comes from purchases that they list as 'third party'.I have been ordering from Amazon for seven years and have always been impressed with their customer support. But after calling to find out why I had still not received my order, I was told by their new call center in the Philippines that I would have to contact the third party directly. They also said they have no control over any part of that transaction and need to contact the seller (which I thought I was doing when I called Amazon).I won't order from Amazon again until they bring back the customer support they were known for. In the mean time all I have to be concerned with is all my personal information being lost or stolen from some third party company located somewhere in the South Seas."
1,Not working,I love the product it just has not worked since I put it in my pond. We recently had a snow and normally it would have melt the snow around it but it didn't. I have purchased this before from this company so I know how they work. But if I return I only get partial refund and have to pay shipping. Will buy elsewhere if that's the case.
1,Dead within 6 weeks,"The one I bought stopped working within 6 weeks of putting it in the pond. I am not very impressed. I cannot imagine why it fails, since it is basically only a heating coil and a temperature sensor. You can see from many other reviews that this product just does not last. You would have thought that with the number of posts about the failure rate, that they would have redesigned it by now."
1,Absolute trash,"I have had to replace this piece of garbage each year.It does work, but only for 1 winter.I'll never buy another one of these deicers again"
1,Unreliable,"This product is a waste of money. It lasted only 2 weeks and quit working. I would not recommend anyone purchasing this product. The minute the temperature dropped to less than 20 degrees, it stopped working."
4,My usage and opinions for care.,"This is required for me to keep an opening in my pond, not for a livestock tank. It works exactly like it is suppose to, on a thermostat. My suggestion is to float 2 in the fall because if one fails you cannot take a chance on getting another and getting it in and thaw an opening in time to save the fish. This happened with my first one and I was lucky that it warmed up enough that I had time to replace it. You can't pound on the ice to create an opening in smaller ponds because of concussions going through the water. That's why I suggest 2. Ponds and fish aren't cheap to maintain and this is an absolute necessity to protect your investment unless you run your pump all winter. My opinions from 6 years of winters."
2,Sound Wasn't There For Me,"CD sounded old. I thought I would like it because of the original voices, but I didn't.Before you buy it, try to listen to all the tracks."
1,expiration date,"The container I received had one month to go before the expiration date. The problem lies with Amazon not Labrada. so before you order protein from Amazon think twice. The expiration date is usually 2 years from date of manufacture, so it had been sitting for a while. Before I ordered it I did ask if it were fresh product. They assured me it was."
3,A lighter Alan Moore story,"If you like Alan Moore's work because of its deep political and cultural themes, you might be surprised by 'the League.' It's a lot lighter than V, From Hell (what isn't), and even Watchmen. Unlike those books, this one is pretty much a straight adventure story, aided by some great art by Kevin O'Neill. In my opinion it may be a little overhyped but if you like a good story with good characters go ahead and pick it up. And don't worry about the Volume 1 tag, it's a complete story with an open ending leading into Volume 2."
4,Alan Moore goes Victorian,"The most lighthearted tale even written by acclaimed comicbook scribe, Alan Moore, is likely the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. Moore borrows characters from famous works in Victorian Literature, including Mina Murray, Captain Nemo, the Invisible Man, Alan Quartermain, Dr. Jeckell and Mr. Hyde, and places them in a Justice League-type team, gathered together to find a stolen device capable of unleashing the horrors of aerial warfare on London. Moore constructs a dead-on parody of these high-flying romantic heroes; their stuffy attitudes and language; their utter political incorrectness; their obvious sexual hang-ups. Fans of Moore's darker work, such as Watchmen and From Hell, may be disappointed, but those of us who have read the rousing tails of adventure it masterfully parodies will find the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen entertaining and hilarious."
4,Good story!,"League of Extraordinary Gentlemen Vol. 1 is an exciting, fast paced story running across the globe. The fictionalized-Victorian setting is really cool, and the author has created and keeps the story in a dry old humor thats as far politically-incorrect from today's standards as possible. I've enjoyed this novel, like I have with many other works by Alan Moore."
5,"Review of Moore League, Vol I","Here, again, Moore suceeds with excellent storytelling, gathering an all-star cast of mythical English characters and arranging them for the reader's utmost enjoyment. This work, much like From Hell, presents another great satirization of Victorian culture. There are also a bunch of goodies in the back of this volume, not to be missed."
3,"Solid Writing and Art, but Largely Forgetable","I read this after reading two other comics by Alan Moore, From Hell and Watchmen, and it does not stack up to either of those stories. High expectations were further raised by my particularly love with 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, where Capt. Nemo is from. It was great seeing him and the Nautilus in this tale, but when the volume finished, I was left unsatisfied. The villain was forgettable and character growth was minimal. It wasn't what I've come to expect from Moore."
1,Doesn't work for Kindle PC,"I don't know why Amazon hasn't gotten their act together with compatibility, it's disgraceful that I can view this on my phone and not on my 25"" monitor."
1,unimpressive; idiotic; racist,"Having enjoyed reading Alan Moore's ""Watchmen,"" I looked to League of Extraordinary Gentlement hoping to find more intelligent writing and deep plots. I found neither in this piece of [expletive deleted]. Filled with racist tones and needless violence, this [expletive deleted] book is complete and total [expletive deleted] compared to The Watchmen. What the [expletive deleted] wass Alan Moore thinking when he wrote this? It's as if he wiped his [expletive deleted] and handed the resulting [expletive deleted] to the publisher, thereby resulting in this book-bound [expletive deleted] being sold.Most likely this book will be enjoyed by teenage fanboys around the world who wouldn't know good writing from their left [expletive deleted]."
4,VERY VERY Cool Idea But....,"League is well illustrated, and the extra advertisements and the masthead with the old time style of writing definitely adds to the authentic feel it's trying to recreate. Narrative passages at the end of each issue (Watchmen style) help add another dimension to the story.The idea of making a superhero team with the heroes from Victorian literature is very fresh. The plot twists a bit, but in the end, it's just that: a superhero story. But this is what Alan Moore is doing. He deconstructed superheroes in his seminal magnum opus, ""Watchmen,"" and now he's recreating them again with the entire line of ""America's Best Comics."" On one hand, League is something truly unique and fresh, but on the other hand, it's still a comic that could have been published by Marvel."
4,Intelligent and enjoyable,"With many visual and textual references to other types of literature, including 19th Century American girls' lit (notably What Katy Did- one of the funniest jokes in there!), this is an immensely enjoyable adventure. Industrialised London is overbearingly Victorian and gothic, India is full of murdering heathens (very un-pc!), and men still feel the need to protect poor little women... It's a gem, but a gem that doesn't take itself too seriously. I'd recommend it to anybody, including those who read extensively in all genres, and those who don't. I read it twice in 24 hours after getting it, picking up on new things each time. When's the next volume out?"
3,Not what I was expecting,"I got this because the movie had such potential but was so bad. I hoped this would be a much better artistic expression of the story. While I did enjoy a good portion of the comic I am not a huge fan of the art style. The short stories at the end which begin each chapter with a ""recap"" (which felt redundant for such short intervals all compiled in one place) may have been the most interesting parts."
4,interesting,"I love Alan Moore. I think, with the exception of Frank Miller, he's the greatest comic book writer of all time (though Jeph Loeb is fast taking his place with those two). I love the Watchmen. I love his DC work. I love Top Ten. And V for Vendetta is very good. TLOEG is somewhat weaker. He took characters that could be real, I suppose. And put them in this situation. Definitely worth reading if you love comic books, Moore, or the movie."
1,Yawn...,"I only have one complaint of this book, but it's big enough to knock four stars off the rating. It's extremely, *yawn*, boring. There's not much else to say; like it seems most of the reviewers here have, I've read Alan Moore's other work. Watchmen and Promethea both changed the way I looked at things, Promethea especially (the artwork and layout are beyond beautiful). But this dull piece of garbage is only filled with grey, or light brown, panels and slow, *yawn*, rambling, dross dialogue that I can only imagine the dullest of people enjoying. But still, Promethea is out of this world, even if this comic is chained to this one."
2,Lacking,"After reading comics such as Girl Genius and Archie comics, I feel like buying this book was a waste of money. The plot was lacking as well as the artistry. I had high hopes for it because of the movie, but I was sorely disappointed."
3,Your enjoyment will greatly depend...,"on your knowledge of 19th century literature and history. The novel is infinitely superior to the trainwreck of a movie that was released, but be advised the story has a number of adult elements and historical stereotypes you will want to consider before exposing to younger readers."
4,Don't order this title for your kids,"I liked Watchmen, so I ordered TLoEG Vol 1 and 2 for my 10 year old son for Christmas. Thankfully, I started reading it before he did as it is very much an adult themed graphic novel, with a couple of rape scenes in the first half of Vol 1 alone. I haven't finished the book yet - just wanted to give a head's up to other parents out there before they made the same mistake I did. With Captain Nemo, et al. it never occurred to me that it would lean in this direction. Fine for me, just NOT AT ALL APPROPRIATE for preteens."
5,A Scorcher!,"In 1971, Arlene DeMarco, the youngest of the 1940's/1950's singing group, The DeMarco Sisters, published her first novel, Triangle. Although fiction, the novel is loosely based on her stormy marriage to actor Keefe Brasselle. DeMarco proves she can write, as well as sing, with her stinging portrayals of unflattering, unlikeable, but yet unforgettable characters.If you are fan of Jacqueline Susann and Jackie Collins, you'll love this scorcher!"
4,Plyometrics for Kids,I've started using this book and dvd for training my kids. They enjoy it and it does a great job explaining and demonstrating the exercises.
5,A Celebration!,"I bought this years ago and for me it's one of those ""desert island"" CDs, absolutely essential. I've listened to it hundreds of times. It is unlike anything else- spiritual (any denomination from Taoist to Christian to Pagan), with chanting in places, rhythmic, and mostly acapella. It celebrates being human and alive. The harmonies are gorgeous. I defy anyone to remain down or mired in problems after listening to this. It's celebratory, yet earthy and grounded (definitely human, not angelic or ethereal, there's nothing ""sweet"" about it). This is empowering music, ideal for feeling in touch with the universe and yourself while getting things done! I wish I could think of something to liken it to, but it's utterly unique. Definitely music you find yourself singing along with."
1,EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING,"If like me you have heard the other amazing Graphic Audio Dramatisations, you will be aware of the extrodinary production value of these classic stories. Unfortunatley it is wasted on this CD, the story is extremely poor for thos format. Not worth the effort for the cast or crew. But i will continue buying all new DC Graphic Audio Dramatisations."
4,WOOOOOOOOOO,Finally a justice league story that holds its own. Roger Stern and Alan Grant who wrote Batman:The Stone King are the only writers of the Justice League series whose stories I really enjoyed. Both have a lot action and a real plot. Superman: TheNever Ending Battle shows a side of Superman that I've known was always a part of him. Thank you for writing a real story about ahero who Christopher Reeve protrayed in the movies who will always be a part of my life and many life's to come.
3,"Worked decently, does leak onto the next paper","These receipts work just fine, but they do leak onto the next paper. You need to put a piece of cardboard or something between the page you're writing on and the next one."
5,"Perfect, and here's a tip...","To all the people complaining that you have to tear off the cover to use between sheets, you've forgotten that Amazon sent this to you in a nice cardboard box. Cut off one of the flaps and you have your ""between sheets"" cardboard!"
5,Stevie Wonder: Concepts,"I originally heard this cd several years ago. I loved the songs but never purchased the it. After watching one of my favorite movies which contained a Stevie Wonder song on its soundtrack, I logged on and looked for this cd and was pleased to find it!"
2,Not very good,"While I can appreciate interpretations of classics, the best songs on this album are the ones that sound virtually identical to the original, which you probably already own if you're thinking about buying this album. And that pretty much eliminates the need to buy this album at all."
4,Conception Indeed,I enjoyed the interpretations of the Stevie Wonder. I love all the artists on this CD.
3,I like it but...,"I was a little disappointed... I guess I did have high expectations because this was a Stevie Wonder Tribute right? One of my favourite Stevie Wonder songs is ""Overjoyed"" so regardless I did enjoy Mary J and probably the only other song I did like was India Arie singing Wonderful, would have really liked to see a Ruben take for example with a ""Ribbon in the Sky"" even this song I thought should have been on this album. The rest I didn't feel. Just my opinion and I don't mean to offend as I know they are good artists but Eric Clapton & John Mellencamp had me raising an eyebrow and I didn't enjoy them. Just felt that the album did not do Stevie Wonder justice, he has so many great songs and there's so many artists out there that possibly could have done more???"
3,Pretty Good but not Stevie worthy,"there are some tight Moments here but overall the problem is that there isn't the right Artist featured to truly do Stevie justice.Aretha Franklin,Luther Vandross,R.Kelly should be here on this set.Black Coffey&Brian Mcknight I like there Takes.but overall Something is missing besides Stevie it has to be a Certain feeling&vibe you get when you hear Stevie that is lacking overally here.but still Pretty Good Set."
3,The Music of My Life,Would like it better if they alternated the mono versions with the stereo selections. I remember oaying a dollar more to listen in stereo at home.
2,Not a great remaster,"I agree with a previous reviewer: the remastering job on this release is subpar. While I would give All Summer Long four stars based on the music, I would give it one star for the somewhat suppressed and muddy sound. I have listened to the other remastered albums and they all sound good to very good. Too bad, since this is one of my favorite BB albums."
4,A great 'Advanced Securty' book for AS/400 geeks,"This is an awesome book describing AS/400 Security Strengths and weaknesses - especially as they relate to networking. I'd place it in the 'Advanced' catagory. If you're looking for a 'How-to' book, you'll want to look elsewhere, but if you already know 'How to', this one can be a real eye opener."
4,Fast Paced and Entertaining,"I enjoyed this book, as ""typical"" as it maybe, I think it's well worth a read."
2,"Tough guy P.I. takes a beating, but keeps on trucking","This is a typical private detective book from the post-WWII era. In it, as usual, the hero (Lew Archer) is accidentally involved in a case, and then decides to pursue the case, even though DANGER is everywhere. There is the requisite amount of hero-being-beat-up stuff, combined with hero-beating-others-up. There are the ""bad"" girls, and the who-knows-what-they-are girls (or 'gals', perhaps). There are the seedy denizens of the seedy town doing seedy things. And those are just the cops! There is also the seedy motel owner and his dissatisfied wife. Also on hand is the young criminal (just graduated from the juvenile delinquent ranks) and the wise old man who has seen much heartache.I suspect this book was pretty hot when it came out, but it's almost a parody of the genre today, sad to say. I can stand about one Ross MacDonald a year, just to give me some perspective on this part of the mystery/suspense scene, and Find a Victim is it for this year."
1,Perfect for a Midget...,"very disappointing product for a multitude of reasons:- height of the product is stupid, just over knee-height, i.e. too tall to put on a table, way too low to have on the ground. Subsequently, the gas bottle does not fit below the burner and has to stand on the side. HELLO - does the guy who designs this thing actually tries the product? How much more expensive would it be to make it a bit taller?- assembly instructions are pathetically bad, makes every China-made product look excellent (the King Cooker claims to be US made): no step by step instructions, one single unconclusive picture- Product that shipped is different that product on the picture, wind-guard is about 3"" tall only. (This metal ring (it is not a windguard) clearly was not made for the product as hole for gas pipe does not fit for burner"
4,Nice Product,"Takes time to put stand together but the finished product looks good. Must work the Wok in which I did not know how to do.However, I'm sure after a few cook outs everything will be fine. The bottom line is that I found one and it is a heavy duty onethat looks and feels like it will last me for many years to come. It is big enough to cook for at least four or five people with noover spill. I like this product allot."
2,not so good,"worked ok for awhile, then gas flame much lower, not sure if problem w regulator or blocked hose. Then I got a real outdoor wok stove from wokshop in SF. Completely different experience--a real wok stove, only $89, works incredibly, self igniting, good burner control, excellent heat distribution (the king cooker seemed to only heat one circular area of the wok very high, the wokstove I found at the wokshop heats the whole wok evenly."
5,king kooker wok on youtube,"i put my review on youtube with mod. see mrtoupsclassroom on youtubei like it very much and have used it a lotcomtact me if you have questions i got it shipped to the door for 50 dollars with activation of amazon card and the other thing??? cancelled the other thing.................the shipping plus or something.........still have the card not sure how long i will use it or leave it activated................Good Luck, mr toupscheers,brain"
4,Manual misleading,"The unit operates well and makes excellent stir-fry. The ""manual"" however is confusing, and the illustrations don't match the parts sent. Had to call them to get accurate assembly instructions. Inconsiderate to customers, that."
2,King Kooker 24WC,"The unit i received not the same as the picture shown, the wind guard is haft the height of what show on the picture. Not easy put it together. i did some test cooking, the gas head is about 10 inches away from the bottom of the wok and low wind guard, it will not heat wok to high temperature, little breeze would stop cooking completely.Not for outdoor cooking. don't buy it."
2,Actual item shipped is different than the picture,"They shipped a different item than what is pictured. Instead I received the 18"" Bolt Together Portable Propane Outdoor Cooker (which they also sell alone)... and they threw in a wok and accessories. On top of that, there were just bolts, and no nuts that came with the cooker so I had to buy my own from the hardware store. So basically, i received the wrong item... and it was also missing pieces."
2,don't buy this,"this is not want i wanted, this is so light-duty, and the stand just has to be re-welded to stand-up, very cheap i don,t think i will even put a flower pot on it.Im really unhappy with this prouduct"
1,Old and Useless Book,"This book is basically useless. It really does not give you what you need to know in order to grade coins. The population counts are from 2004 and have dramatically changed since then.If you want to learn how to grade coins I suggest the following:Beginners:Photograde: Official Photographic Grading Guide for United States Coins, 19th EditionIntermediate:The Official American Numismatic Association Grading Standards of United States Coins (Official American Numismatic Association Grading Standards for United States Coins)Experts only(Mint State Grading):How to Grade U.S. Coins"
3,coil spring compressor,"It works but! Item tends to slip off under compression which could be hazardous. If I needed another one I would spend the money for a better quality one. If you purchase this one please be careful, Because when it came off on me there was no warning."
2,poor quality,This is not a well made tool. I bought it to put front coil springs in a 60's classic car that I am rebuilding the front end on. It did one spring well but the flange bent in the process and when I got to the second spring it released the spring under full tension and almost injured me badly.
5,Use Carefully and It Will Work Like a Charm,"Did not have any trouble removing my old coil springs. As suggested, I applied a liberal amount of grease to the threads first, and made sure to position the compressor carefully. Worked without a hitch. Make sure to wear a safety face shield as with all other automotive tools."
4,Works as advertised,"Works as advertised, follow the instructions and line it up as instructed and it compressed the spring correctly"
2,BU-120 Sounded Great when it was working!,I gave the Infinity BU-120 2 stars for the speaker... I have replaced the S53AMI twice in my BU-120 subwoofer... I will try to salvage the speaker... the amplifier is junk. I am going to invest in a good subwoofer after doing much research first!
2,Add me to the list........,"I have really enjoyed my subwoofer....when it is working! About a year after purchasing it, I had the same problem with the amplifier blowing and it was fixed under warranty. About a year ago the speaker sounded like it was blown and I discovered the plastic gasket or casing that holds the speaker in place broke and I will have to replace the woofer to the tune of 80.00 just to fix it. For now I have been keeping the volume down, but it only vibrates on really loud rumbles. Conveniently, there are no service centers in Northern California; I cringe at the thought of giving them 80 more dollars....grrr"
1,"Work for awhile, now it is dead","Worked for a few months, then started making a popping noise when not fed by the receiver, then it simply stopped working and only makes popping noise. Probably same problem others reported. $200 to waste since it can't be repaired and Infinity refuses to fix it. What a custimer focus they have. Never will buy from them again."
2,Check your BU-120 before you call the police.,"I was out of town when our sub started to make it's noise in the middle of the night. My wife thought someone was in the house so she called the police who showed up, heard the noise and drew their guns before entering the movie room. I would have only given a rating of one star however thinking back on how much excitement this piece of equipment added to our lives I gave it an extra star.This is the second time this thing has given up and I'm not going through the hassle or expense of fixing it again. The first time was covered by warrenty only after infinity made me the middle man arguing with their approved service center for 2 weeks. Ya gotta love these warranties.... Ya we'll fix it, but we aint gonna make it easy on ya."
1,Infinity BU120 review - replacement,"I, too, own an Infinity BU120 Subwoofer (since 1998) and have experienced two amplifier failures as described in the other reviews. The unit is currently making the machine gun popping sounds described by others. I contacted Infinity to buy a replacement amp and they are offering a new (not reconditioned) replacement unit - Model PS212BK Subwoofer (12"", 400 watt) - delivered to my home for $227. After pricing other replacement subwoofers, I took them up on their offer. The new unit retails on the Infinity website for ~$574. Hopefully I will have better luck with this new unit."
3,BU-120 Review,"I've had my Infinity BU-120 for over seven years. But around 1 year ago I began to experience the ""machine gun"" sound once the unit had been powered up for a long period of time. It's slowly getting worse and I'm sure it will become unusable in the near future unless I replace the capacitor. Low quality electrolytic capacitors are a common problem with electronic devices. These manufacturers need to spend more time in making sourcing decisions for critical components like these.Aside from this issue, the first six years of operation were absolutely trouble free. This sub will shake my entire house and knock picture frames off the wall if cranked up."
1,"NO, sorry, just no","And I write this as someone who owns Boulez's Mahler 6, 7 and 9, and like each of them a lot.But, he just doesn't get the Mahler 2 right. Tempo nuances, phrasing, volume, etc., just aren't there.Part of this, I believe is due to this being near the beginning of Boulez's effort to tackle Mahler. No matter.Gilbert Kaplan and others are definitely better among modern interpreters, and Klemperer has a great older recording on EMI."
3,It is exactly what it sounds like,"A starter deck and nothing more. I recieved this deck for my birthday and used it in my first readings. The artwork is simple (although badly drawn and misleading on a few cards), which really helps you focus on the true meaning of the scene depicted in the cards. The descriptions on the cards themselves are handy for the initial look, but when I review my results to really let them sink in I do refer to other sources for more/better descriptions.Overall, it's a good test to see if you want to continue to pursue tarot. I don't suggest spending your money on this if you can find a rider-waite deck. I bought the RW deck less than a week after recieving this one and I'm very happy."
4,The best set for beginners.,"I owned a couple of tarot sets before buying this one. If I had found these at first, they would be the only set I have. You can actually use these the first day you get them, as opposed to putting a couple weeks/months into card study before you can actually do a reading (without the book in hand).Some may consider having the meanings on the cards to be amaturish, but others can take comfort in the knowledge that the reading is reliable. The meanings are right there for the reader and querent.The illustrations are simple and have a positive vibe to them. This may be objectionable to those who like a moody and mysterious feel to a reading. I personally think they are ok."
1,An insult to the art and craft of Tarot,"As a Tarot reader and teacher for over 30 years I find this deck insulting to the art of Tarot and possibly harmful to the querent. It reduces a great divination system to the level of cootie catchers or the Magic 8 Ball. Sure, telephone psychics can use it when they know nothing about Tarot, but are they then calling themselves Tarot Readers simply because they can read the words off of a card? For this a client is spending $3.99/hour?! There are great books available on the Tarot. Please, take a decent class, sign up for TarotL at yahoogroups, or go to a Tarot Conference and learn what Tarot is really about."
2,"I'm a novice Tarot Reader but I know an inferior design,","I received this yesterday and plan to return it. My cat could have produced these drawings, how boring and uninspired. Since being disappointed, I've discovered how many Tarot designs exist (hundreds at least) and am so grateful for Amazon.com's liberal return policy. P.S. I love you, Amazon.com, but I don't love this item!"
4,Great For Phone Readers,"I think this is a great way for phone readers to be able to keep there mind on the reading and not wrapped up in the cards. It gives you a good starting point to learn what the cards mean to you. It is also nice for people who have read for a long time becuase everyone has moments of blankness. The pictures are simplistic which helps you keep on track and not distracted by the art work. So, far I have not found a better deck for reading on the phones."
3,I used these for work,"Decent for phone-a-psychics. Really bad art work. I could have drawn these, but if you're on the phone nobody else can see them. Descriptions are kind of repetitive. Similar descriptions for diffrent cards. I did like that it had the reverse meanings printed and it comes with a neat little phamplet about the history of tarot. Dont use these as a script, you still will have to make up a lot. I would have had less art work and more explinations."
4,A neat little set,"I mainly became interested in Tarot by researching practicing magic in order to make my fantasy writing more believable. I thought this set was really handy because the booklet includes basic instructions on laying out the cards and their relationship with one another, as well as providing an overview of the history of Tarot cards and the story of the cards themselves. The cards themselves include brief explanations of the meaning of each card in both the upright and reverse positions. Altogether, I found it easy to grasp. I was able to perform my first reading within a few minutes of finishing the instruction book."
2,Not as described,"There's something wonky with the product description. It's a single bone, not ""3 slices per bag."" And apparently there's no uniformity with this product. Another reviewer said their bone was small, 4 inches. The bone I got was HUGE, way too big for my dog. I gave it to my friend's mastiff who enjoyed it but that's how big this bone was. If you're a fan of roulette, proceed."
4,Dogs loves this bone!,"My Australian Shepherd and Border Collie love this bone. I just wish it lasted longer. The icky white bones lasted a little while, but this did not. It lasted a few hours, but that was fine because they would not let it out of their sight! A good distraction when you need one lol! They never stopped chewing this bone. Wait yes they did, they stopped when the other would attempt to get a taste! They had to defend there bone of course."
2,To Barking Small!!!,"Bubba loved the bone, but was a little dissapointed in the size of the bone. They must have killed some baby pigs to get femurs this small! Bone was about 4 inches long, and not very thick."
1,NEVER FEED THESE TO A DOG!!!,"I gave one of these to my dog and he is now undergoing major surgery to have many sharp fragments removed from his stomach and intestines, after which he could still die. There have been a number of severe illnesses and deaths from blockages and/or intestinal punctures with this type of cooked bone. Just go with Nylabone or Kong with peanut butter."
1,Made my dog SICK,"My boxer enjoyed the treat, though after eating it she drank a bowl full of water. Maybe it had a lot of sodium. The real surprise came the next day though when she suffered a loss of bowel control; she's never went #2 in the house since we got her over a year ago. Afterwards, we took her on a hike and she couldn't seem to stop ""going"", had 7 bowel movements on a 2 mile hike; and they were very watery. She's still not acting back to her normal self. I guess it makes sense; I wouldn't trust a butcher from a group of people whom I know to be cannibals, why should I trust dog treats made in countries that eat dogs?"
5,Really beautiful and different,This is a very pretty hand crafted vase. A circle within a circle with a glass tube in the center that holds the two pieces together. Took a while to get here - they are made and shipped directly from Thailand - but it was worth the wait.
4,fun stuff,"This book is for the serious Milton scholar. It makes for a dry read and serves better as a reference book. But man, if you're writing on classical mythology in Milton, this is your one must have source! It contains an alphabetical listing of all of the mythological references Milton makes in his poems with an explanation of their classical sources and a list of their locations in Milton's poetry. It made my life a whole life easier!"
1,Stick to other labels' soundtrack comps,"...It sounds like someone held a microphone next to a television set. The music selection is interestng and amusing, and the package is nice enough.The track details are sparse. Some tracks identify film titles; some do not, and there is no composer or musician or producer informationThere is a real need for a better version of an album like this...As for this, get it if you really don't care about audio quality. I usually DON'T, actually, but this album still bothers me. I'm sure it will bother a serious soundtrack album collector much more."
2,Novelty CD,Listening to Deep Note was interesting and entertaining the way that Weird Al is. After listening to it once not very interesting any more. Not very memorable.
1,stale,this item arrived stale. it was virtually uneatable. i believe it was in stock for several months before it was sent out. i would not recommend this item under any conditions.
4,Case Closed? - Maybe!,"This book is an exceptional, non-sensational read concerning the disappearance of Earhart and Noonan. The author seems accurate in his analysis of the facts presented. He painstakingly found employees of Lockheed who claimed they installed cameras in the lower fuselage in addition to cutting holes for these cameras. He locates two Saipanese/Gaumanians who had photos of Earhart and claimed to have seen her after her disappearance. His claims that she was probably executed as a spy prove hard to dispute. And the photo of the plane missing one wing is a ""wow"" factor. Definitely worth a read!"
2,Errors in Lost Star,"On page 108 the author cites two conflicting top airspeeds for Earhart's airplane - 240 and 220 mph. On page 174 the author say storage and mondifications of Earhart's airplane took place at Alameda Naval Air Station, but in 1937 Alameda Naval Air Station did not exist. It was opened in late 1940."
1,Awful,"I truly can't stand stupid heroines. This is one of the worst I've ever read. The author made her so ""innocent"" as to be unbelievable."
2,not so good,"I am not a writer, author, publisher or anyone wishing to promote the sale of books. This one isn't worth the time or money"
4,"Pricey, but worth it","If you have a Honeywell electronic air filter that uses these, it is worth replacing them once or twice a year. I vacuum them occasionally in between."
3,unadulterated vegetarian grindgore,"This is definitely extreme music. Of the 18 songs, only three are over 1 minute long, and two of those are exactly 1 minute long. I have classical and doom metal CDs with 1 song longer than this entire CD. The last song, of course, is only 1:05 long, with a long silent period followed by a weird telephone call to an Albertson's meat department for about 1.5 minutes. Silly, but whatever. Utterly extreme grindcore, with dual processed deep monster vocals and screeching banshee shrieks. Lyrics detail body functions, diseases, disgusting decrepitude and decomposition, all for the sake of the vegan/vegetarian agenda. 18 songs at 16:10 total play time. I suggest ""karma.bloody.karma"" for these guys as a more serious death-gore effort."
1,A Hellish Din,"Do people actually listen to this noise? The only merit I can see in groups like Cattle Decapitation is that their album artwork always pushes the definitions ""sick"" and ""grotesque"".A friend recently bought this on picture disc just for the artwork. I convinced him to play it to find out if the music was as repulsive as some of the song titles.What a hellish din! There are no 'songs' as most people understand a song to be, just a non-stop grinding assault on the senses. If this recording is popular anywhere, it must be in Hell's Top Ten.Of course, there are some people who pretend to like this sort of aural rubbish, but I can't imagine anyone serious about music finding any entertainment value in Human Jerky beyond the warped artwork that graces the packaging."
5,The origianal life saver,"To have a reproduction of an orignal text book that has in my opinion ""quietly changed the world, one seemingly hopeles person at a time"" at such a remarkably low price is phenominal knowing that when I did a search on the internet through several different auction it was rare to find an origianal first edition in good to excelent condition for under $1,000."
1,Beware of pretenders.....,"This book and publisher.....AA Services........is NOT the same as 'Alcoholics Anonymous'. Publisher is reprinting Alcoholics Anonymous's original literature, in order to make profit. They have gone so far as to utilize a similar book jacket that Alcoholics Anonymous used. I mistakenly bought this book, did not pay enough attention. Alcoholics Anonymous publishes under 'World Services'....not 'AA Services'.This chameleon book is a shame, especially since AA Services could add/contribute more to recovery scene if they wanted to. Instead the owners of this misleading AA Services company has used terms, literature, etc, to make money off of recovery literature that Alcoholics Anonymous worked hard and honestly to develop and make a change in peoples' lives. I will be careful from now on, what I buy at Amazon.com or other sites I felt duped...."
2,Disappointed.,"I was very disappointed. The reproduction should have been a larger book. When I called up they said they no longer make the larger book. I commented that it should no longer be listed as a ""Reproduction of the First printing of the First Edition""."
1,Firmware on this box is buggy,It would be nice if it did what it said on the tin but we found that this box couldn't stay up for more than a week before hanging and requiring a power cycle to get going again. 3Com gave us a patch to fix the bug which totally wrecked the thing and took out the onboard webserver required to manage it. We're replacing it with something else. Do not buy this product.
4,Bless This House is a Real Blessing,Bless this house is a lovely film to watch and can even make the most cold hearted person laugh.
5,EXCELLENT. CLASSIC BRITISH COMEDY.,"A TYPICAL 70'S ENGLISH COMEDY FILM, TAKEN FROM THE TV SERIES BLESS THIS HOUSE. THEY DON'T MAKE THEM LIKE THIS ANYMORE."
2,BLESS THIS HOUSE,"As with most spin off movies of British sitcoms, they seem nothing more than over long and extended sketches of a standard episode. By no means is this a bad film as it does hold some laughs and likeable performances from its impressive cast list such as Sid James, Terry Scott, June Whitfield and Patsy Rolands, but it has no real plot as such and the whole thing careers along with no real direction. At best the film can be described as adequate although die hard fans of the series will lap it up. The whole thing seems terribly dated now though!"
5,Big Balls Rock!,"I have given away my fender buoys since starting to use these... Fenders are useless at a dock with 6"" diameter steel poles standing proud of the dock because the fender always works off the pole and drops into the gap leaving the rub rail grinding up and down on the steel pole... The ball is hung in the gap and stands the rub rail clear of the poles as the boat rocks..."
5,Youth,"Otis Redding was the man to listen to in my youth. The memories off this ablum is unforgettable. there are no words to say about this album, but thanks for the memories."
3,For MS-1s,This book is adequate. I cannot give it a much more glowing review than that. I must agree with some of the other reviewers in that it lacks good figures. The text is ok. I would definitely discourage anyone from buying this as a reference text.I mainly bought the book because it has review questions at the end of each chapter that sometimes appear on our exams.For med students I would definitely stick with the BRS Micro/immuno and augment it's succinctness with handwritten notes.
2,Good but still needs some reviewing,"I used this book in my immunology class at the University of Puerto Rico-Rio Piedras campus and first the class was awful because of the professor that didn't know what she was teaching and because the book even though is good still needs some work to be done, its full with errors, for example when it is explaining the immunoassays it doen's say that there are two kinds of ELISA:Direct and Indirect, it also doesn't explain the concept of Titer so if you take this class and use this textbook as your primary reference book be prepared to read and memorize like crazy, Immunology is a subject that should be teach in a conscise manner and with an analytical perspective not with the ""empty-the-bottle"" approach."
5,Bargain Bundle,"At only $2,000 this bundle is an extraordinary bargain. When I saw the price I couldn't believe my eyes. I would have been more than happy to have paid four or five times what they're asking. Of course, I bought this product immediately, worried that the low price wouldn't last. I haven't actually read many of these since receiving them and two of the DVD-ROMs don't work properly, but just knowing I have them (right now they're resting comfortably under my bed) gives me a warm and fuzzy feeling."
2,Tons of weapons. Tons of inaccuracies.,"As usual, the staff at Palladium did little to no actual research regarding the weapons used in their games. All the damage stats are woefully underrated and the ranges are tragically overrated.However, there are a ton of different weapons and their descriptions contained in this book. There is also body armor and a few vehicles.Zeleznik's cover is pretty cool and the interior art is stark but accurate.I wouldn't pay more than around $8 for this book unless your just trying to complete a collection."
1,Not good at all.,"The description of the book was nearly perfect, This is not true. The spine of the book is broken in many places. I would not look in the book because I was afraid that the book might fall apart. I am returning the book."
5,Forget the comparisons - a fresh new voice,"THE opening five songs are just tremendous. Matthew Jay, a bright young thing from South Wales is quite an exceptional find. His clever material stands out immediately. Like his contemporaries Ben Christophers (only less glacial) and Elliott Smith (albeit simpler, more varied and tuneful), Jay is a thoroughly modern, traditional songwriter.Jay's clear, high voice (rather reminiscent to A-ha's Morten Harket) and appealing choruses serve notice of someone who could potentially make it big. Thanks in part to the excellent production, he strikes just the right balance between thoughtfulness and rowdiness to make Draw acceptable at any time of day. For example, You're Always Going Too Soon and Only Meant To Say are as good as anything you'll hear this year.Admittedly, he isn't doing anything startlingly new and the standard dips in the middle, but overall this is an upbeat, fully realised affair that will take some beating."
2,not anything too exciting,"This is not a bad album, however I just don't think it's that good either. Is it better than most mainstream pop you hear on the radio? Of course. Would I recommend it? Only if you listen to mainstream pop."
1,"WARNING, not for ""self-application""","The advertisement for this product states ""easy self-application"". This is blatently false, there are two metal locking buckles on the BACK. It even states in the packaging that 'trained technicians' should put it on for you (so as not to overstress the joints, cut off circulation). As I am home alone now with a broken collar bone, AND NO WORKING BRACE, I don't appreciate Amazon's false advertising. Hopefully they will at least reimburse shipping for their mistake?"
2,Too Big,"The small size was too way big for me. I'm pretty small though: 5'1"" and 110 lbs.Would not recommend for a smaller person."
3,not what I expected,"The first problem I had was that this product did not ship for over two weeks after ordering. I emailed the company after the first week asking if there was a problem and why the delay. I did not get an answer but the product shipped a few days later.Once I got the brace - something I would be putting on and taking off by my self - was not what I thought it was. I thought the straps were held my velcro - they are not, they hang down. Also, the metal teeth that hold the straps in place don't lock easily if at all. I would need help taking it off and putting it on.I will keep it - lengthen the straps and add velco."
1,not so great..,"I was expecting this product to be easy to use and helpful, but it was neither. I like how padded the straps are, but it doesn't quite sit right on my shoulders, and I couldn't EVER adjust it myself. I wanted to use it to correct my shoulder from falling forward when I sleep on my side, and all it did was cause my arms to go numb. My physical therapist suggested a shoulder brace, but she clearly didn't mean this one!!"
5,Great Product!!,This figure 8 was recommended by my chiropractor and physical therapist as well as my massage therapist. Works great to help train me to keep good posture.
2,There are better ways,"WAY too bulky. WAY too uncomfortable. Icouldn't even put my arms down to my sides--I looked like that little kid in ""A Christmas Story""--all dressed to venture into the snow in a big puffy snowsuit. I've tried a number of different products--none have met my specific needs. I think I'll resort to making my own.The vendor was good."
5,"Oh, it's a GRAY day!","This isn't an easy disc to get ahold of but, whatever it takes, it's worth it. Both singers are superb and the songs and orchestrations just pour over you. Dolores Gray's rich, supple, astounding voice -- imagine a cello, a snifter of warm brandy, hot honey -- is for the ages. She makes contemporary ""sexpots"" like Britney or J-Lo sound like nasal, narcissistic brats and leaves them in the dust. This is very good stuff. Enjoy!"
4,doublemint pleasure,"This is one of the few ways to own a CD of these two great vocalists, Sinatra calibre. The arrangements are lush and warm. The original recordings were in monaural and so the recordings can seem thin but the depth and vibrancy comes through anyway. These are like the original LPs - another edition available ofWarm Brandyincludes four additional singles Gray recorded for Capital, which aren't on this two-on-one. Each of these women were top singers in the US at the time they recorded and you can hear the play and invention in their songs."
3,Heavy on group theory and math,"This is a book about a very math heavy subject, but does try and put a more practical spin on it. If you have been away from math (Calculus and group theory) it MAY NOT be for you. If you pick up new things quickly, that is the intent."
5,Great Book!,This a a good begginers only guide covering many topics in the field of Witchcraft. Tells about famous wizards and secret societies and helps you on your way to mastery of the Art. A great glossary at the end is a big help. I recommend it.
5,...EXCELLENT,"I've never danced in my life, but I decided to learn tap dancing because I'm very much into drama and I plan to audition for the show ""A Chorus Line."" Earlier before buying any tapes, I thought I was a hopeless case and had no chance of getting in. However, I bought this tape and after going through it just a few times, I am a confident tapper! Bonnie Franklin is excellent, as she works at a good pace and knows which steps to repeat and which ones not to. The different angles that the camera zooms in on are great and very helpful.. I would recommend this tape to anyone and everyone-- its just great."
4,entertaining and encouraging,"Franklin is an enthusiastic, fun teacher, who paces her lessons well. You won't get bored, but she also doesn't go so fast that you are left behind. A variety of routines and steps to work through. A good value."
5,Bonnie Franklin Tap DVD,"This is an amazing DVD. It's like having your own Tap tutor, in your own home. Better yet, she teaches at exactly the right speed for you...even if you've never danced before. Fantastic for adult beginners. I can;t say enough."
5,I LOVE this tape!,"What a fast and easy way to be reintroduced to this FUN dance form again, after a 35 year lay-off. This is definitely a beginner's level tape, but Bonnie covers the basic steps very well. If a dancer truly wants to learn the steps correctly, and practices them daily, s/he can progress until after just a few days the sounds are crisp and the foot movements are automatic. A few minutes of daily work can increase speed until, LO!, a tap dancer is born!Bonnie then puts the basic steps into little routines to give students an actual dance to practice. This just increases interest. What a GREAT introductory tape! Sign me up for Bonnie's next instructional video!bacongirl"
5,I HATE TO EXERCISE I LOVE TO TAP,"I AM A 75 YR OLD TAKING TAP DANCING AT OUR RETIREMENT COMMUNITY CLUB HOUSE. THIS FILM HAS BEEN A TERRIFIC PRACTICE VIDEO TO USE IN BETWEEN CLASSES. LOVE IT. BONNIE FRANKLIN IS A FAVORITE OF MINE. ""YEARS"" AGO PEOPLE THOUGHT I RESEMBLED HER. I WAS A SINGLE MOM WITH 3 DAUGHTERS --- THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE RESEMBLANCE!!!!! VERY HAPPY WTH THIS PURCHASE!!!!!"
