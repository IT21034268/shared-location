4,Quality Control keeps it from 5 stars,"Just recently I took the plunge to ""let the dome show"", and in shopping for a razor that wouldn't do quite the damage as my normal razors. I found the HeadBlade at a local grocery, and brought it home. Unfortunately, the first one had a set of ""bent"" clips, so the razor wouldn't stay fastened. No problems, though; I took it back for an exchange, and the replacement worked very well! Nice smooth shave, no nicks (except for one mole I consistently scrape raw), and haven't had any problems cleaning it.Another reviewer suggested the HeadBlade shaving cream, but personally I've had great luck with conventional shaving gels.Great product!"
1,cuts more than hair,"I used this two times, now, and I threw it out after the last time. I cut myself shaving my head with this thing more times this last time than I ever want to experience.I think it has something to do with tthe push vs. pull. When you use this, you push the blade over your head as opposed to pulling the blade over your head.I'm gonna stick to my regular blade to shave my head."
2,a waste of money,"the HeadBlade head shaving razor doesn't shave any better or easier than any other razor that i've used and at age 71 i've used many different blades. it looks cute but is rather awkward to use. i'll pass on cute and use the $1.00 throw away that i've been using for the past 5 shaves until its too dull to shave with, then buy another one."
2,Takes Practice and Still Unforgiving,"Tried the Headblade a few times. It takes allot of getting used to and I never got good enough at using it to get a good shave. Be careful with this thing. It doesn't take much inattentive shaving to get nicked. This might be a good product if you practice allot with it, but after a really good nick, I went back to a regular razor."
5,HeadBlade Is The Best!,Does everything its supposed to do. Easiest way to shave your head without risking cuts. Co-Worker says he can use his to completely shave his head in about two minutes. Price here is cheaper than I paid on company's website.
2,Really not that impressed,"I bought the headblade and had high expectations for it, but it is not worth the cost. I like to have my head smooth after a shave, but the headblade did not remove any stubble. The design would work well with other blades like a Mach 3, but the blade it is supposed to be used with does nothing. I was very disappointed with the headblade and will go back to straight shaving with a Mach 3."
1,How do you get the hair out of the blade?,"I bought this at CVS about 5 years ago after seeing it featured on a TV show. Someone reminded me of it recently, so I decided to share my experience. I've been using a Mach 3 razor for many years to shave my head, and I think it works just fine. I tried this thing, and immediately noticed that there was no easy way to tap the hair out of it. It got clogged with hair and there was no leverage to tap the hair out like there was with a normal shaped razor like the Mach 3. It just got clogged up. I returned it to CVS. Useless compared to the Mach 3. End of story."
2,big fate nope,"I shave my head every three days using a Gillette razor. A friend recommended this and I thought it looked like a novelty. but it was cheap so I tried it out.NOPE.In no way is this better than an ordinary razor. First of all, you have to learn to shave with both hands because you can't reach everywhere with one hand like you can with a long handle razor. Secondly, this was the first time I have ever cut my head shaving.This thing is a joke. Don't waste your money."
1,Like being shaved by Wolverine then washed by Edward Scissorhands,"I spend a bit of money on razors so decided to give this a go. After all the websites seemed fairly positive. I lathered the head, put on the lotion then shaved in one direction, front to back. You may as well have shaved me with a cheese grater.I'm not new to shaving the head, have been doing it for years. Just thought this would have been better. Alas shaving with a two blade razor is like stepping back to the 1980's. Most razors have five blades, at the worst four.I would really not recommend this to anyone."
2,Headblade...ouch!,"I just threw out my Headblade. I used it for about 6 months. 95% of the time it worked great...it's the other 5% that was hard to take. If you have a perfectly round head, you should be okay. But, if you have any scars, mesquito bits, etc., lookout! ...because the headblade will remove them and it is quite messy and it hurts! What I have found works best is a Panasonic electric razor or if you want a really smooth shave, just use a Gillette Ultra...I have never been cut using either of these."
3,Beautiful Sub-Par Quality,"I have become a huge fan of WMF kitchen appliances and ordered this corer to add to my growing collection. The corer is a beautiful addition to my kitchen. The workmanship is wonderful and I do not at all regret the purchase considering the price was very reasonable. However, if you are looking for a functional corer, this one is lacking when it comes to hard apples. The cores get stuck inside and are incredibly difficult to get out. Also, if your hands are wet, as is usually the case when cooking, the grip on the corer becomes very slippery. In addition, the handle is too thin to be comfortable. For softer jobs, like pears, however, the corer was fine, though not great. I would think an OXO with their traditional rubber gripped handle corer would be more functional.I still believe that WMF makes the most beautiful utensils and for an appliance that doesn't get used too often in my kitchen, such as a corer, that's qualification enough for me!"
3,Cam Jansen book lover,This book was not the best Cam Jansen. It was a little boring. I love most of Cam Jansen's books. Cam Jansen and the mystery of the Carnival Prize is my favorite so far.
4,Cool :),This was goodI'm seven years old. I love the mysteries and figuring out what is happening. I hope there are many more books like this!
4,This Book is Real Help for Frustrated Parents,"We have applied Dr. Taylor's recommendations to our child. We did not discontinue the Ritalin. By applying Dr. Taylor's ideas on nutritional supplements, diet modification and sensible parenting together with the medication, our son improved his academic performance from straight ""D""s on his report card to all ""A""s, ""B""s and one ""C"" in the same academic year. Needless to say we are very proud of our son and very grateful to Dr. Taylor."
2,Not satisfied with purchase,"Earrings were a disappointment. They seem cheap considering the price and very small, not impressive at all."
4,Good but little information,"The audio cd was interesting but had many references to books and programs with only short explanations and insights on the topics. More information about Judith Orloff personally while interesting, left little time for the topic at depth. Good as an introduction but light."
4,Good intro to Deepak & Judith,This CD is a good intro to Deepak Chopra & Judith Orloff. If you have already read their books or listened to them then this is not very useful.
3,just ok,"Dr. Orloff seemed a bit giggly and it took a few times to relisten to it in order to get past that portion so that I could ""hear"" the message that they had to give."
2,Not what I expected,It was not easy to follow the discussion. Appeared to be recorded at a seminar with a lot of background noise. Not what I expected.
2,"OK, not worth the money.","It is an interesting cd, however, it only has about 2 hours of discussion. Not worth the money- you can get so much more out of a book."
3,Intuition...,"I was expecting something different for the money. It was all right, not really much information that was helpful. So overall, a disappointment to me. I expected more from Deepak Chopak and Judith Ordoff."
2,plasic resin chair for kids,"the kids like the chairs, but when they sit it them they tip over very frequently....I wish they would have been more sturdyand bottom heavy.....I had to place them against the wall, so when the kids sit in them they dont fall backwards.....THey need to make the chair more bottom heavy on the legs....disappointed"
4,"Finally, a book that reveals the PRS","I found Jan Marsh's book very interesting. She takes the time to try and give a ful account of the women attached to the Pre-Rapaelite Brotherhood. Her research seems thorough, but she also seems to fall into the trap of Victorian notions of the tragic woman. Some of the women did lead tragic lives, but I wish she had down-played this one dimensional aspect to the Pre-Raphaelite Sistrhood."
3,"Great theme, but badly written","A real great story, but badly written. Partly the author is to blame (too many questions remain), but also the editor who did overlook too many mistakes. Despite my criticism, I think the book is a must-read for those interested in the history of Hawaii and the short life of the princess Ka'iulani; the land and the princess lost their grace through North American imperialism. A sad story."
3,"Boney M is GREAT, but this is not the comp to buy.","This is a CD chocked full of the slower Boney M songs, starting down with an chopped-up way-too edited version of The Carnival Is Over, a song way too good to deny in its complete form. I highly recommend the 2 CD Greatest Hits import where you can enjoy the complete unabridged version of the abovementioned song. Although I enjoyed their rendition of ""Heart of Gold"" and the Christmas tunes, this collection is one of the weaker Boney M compilations. Boney M was such an awesome group, but they have so many other CDs that reign over this one!"
4,Nostalgia,"I loved them so much in 70-s and 80-s when I was a teenager. I have not listened to their music for a very long time since then. For some reasons they are not popular in the US as they were in Europe. Anyway, had a chance to listen for their music again and found it as fresh and optimistic as it was long time ago.On the other hand my teenager excitment is gone. By the way, melody in ""Carnival Is Over"" is very much close to the melody of the very popular 19-th century Russian song about ""Sten'ka Razin""..."
5,I love Reboot where can i buy more of these video`s,"My son and i love Reboot.We would like for it to come back on saturday mornings.But, since it hasn`t i would like to know where to buy these tapes.I think this is the best cartoon i have seen in a long time."
3,What GOES on there??,"i hardly believe for a second that the events in this book really happened, hahaha....a weird book (""I"" before ""E""? what up with that??), but it is a fun read. although i'm only giving it 3 stars because it could've been longer and, hrmm, some of the sex stuff made me sick =P""DOLPHIN MASTERS STRIKE AGAIN!"""
3,Wall-eyed,"So I got this toy as a welcome home present for someone. When I got it, I noticed its eyes were a little misaligned. It gives the cat a look of being either really paranoid or maybe just wall-eyed. Kinda decreases the cuteness level..."
5,"Soft, sweet, and adorable","I bought this toy to use as part of a Halloween ""cat burglar"" costume. It's super-soft and has a really sweet face -- I liked it so much, in fact, that while I donated the other stuffed animals I'd bought for the costume, I kept this little kitty for myself. :) A lovely buy!"
4,Lovely Calico Toy,"I was looking for a calico stuffed cat to match our kitty. This one is adorable and the coloration is just perfect. My little girl loves it and takes it everywhere. It has held up over time and many washings. **My only complaint is that it came with an itchy bow on it's neck. My daughter asked me to cut it off, which I did, but a few small clumps of hair came out. I can't fault the toy for the damage I caused, but I wish the bow hadn't been there to begin with."
2,Arrived dirty!,"This toy was one of the small Christmas gifts I planned to give my niece. However, it arrived dirty, as if it had fallen off the conveyor belt and no one paid attention; they simply shipped the dirty toy off to my household. I was very disappointed, but had no time to ship it back. Thus, I had to clean it myself with a Tide pen, and I was not able to completely clean it. So, bottom line: the toy is nice, but the shipping company sucks!"
3,A decent figure to add to your collection.,"Look familiar? Well it should, this Ki-Adi-Mundi figure is the same sculpt as the Episode 1 Ki-Adi-Mundi -except for his right arm. Generally, this figure looks better than the original: its paint ops are closer to the movie's (except for the beard), the new right arm allows for some posing, and he comes with a new lightsaber. However, he's far from perfect. Hasbro got cheap with this one by using an existing sculpt to begin with. The new arm is a welcome change, but the left one looks odd in contrast. Because of this, posing is very limited and Mundi cannot hold his saber with two hands. The lightsaber is also a problem. The blade on mine seems to be jammed in so tightly in the hilt, that it would break if I tried to remove it. Aparrently the peg on the blade is so fragile, it doesn't take much. I've seen several carded Ki-Adi-Mudi figures with sabers broke at the hilt. Despite these flaws, he still looks good posed along side the other Jedi."
1,Don't waist your time or money...trust me.,"This was a HUGE waist of money. Indeed these are old movies, but they do not show much and the climax scenes are non existant. This is little more than a collection of soft core movies. Not worth it at all and I will never by the 42nd Street Pete's brand again."
5,SAD AND POWERFUL,"Originally written in 1951 in Yiddish, this is an eyewitness account of how the Nazis and their local supportors killed the Jews, rabbi by rabbi, village by village."
2,meh Four Paws used to be higher quality,"I wanted to love this brush - I have an old Four Paws brush that ""somehow"" ended up with the handle chewed off. the old brush was my favorite for my tender skinned aussie - and I had it for about 8 years.this new brush is plastic handled instead of wood - which is evident from the picture.The big problem with the new style is the little black safety ends are breaking off the pins after about 2 days of use. this leaves little sharp pins - making my pups & me unhappy."
2,Save your money for iTunes seasons,"How can something called ""The Best DVD In The World"" NOT include the episode ""The Best VHS In The World""?I'll admit it - I'm happy to buy these mixed DVD sets if that helps Cartoon Network realize there IS a market for season sets of this show as well as Adventure Time, but these DVDs really aren't much to write home about. Even the extra features on this one aren't great - they are very similar to the content on cartoonnetwork.com. But honestly, I prefer to buy the season passes on iTunes. They are close in cost and you get the full season."
4,well,I'm glad to see another regular show dvd. And it's nice that there's more episodes this time. But what I would REALLY like to see is a season release!
1,Get with the program,"I love this show but I truly hate the way they are releasing this show in bits and pieces. This is a really funny everyone can enjoy, however you have to be able to find it first. Get with the program (Regular Show) bro."
1,"Jolly good show! This DVD? No dude, no.",Where are the full-season releases this masterpiece of a show deserves? That's the only way Cartoon Network will get my money.Know who ELSE isn't buying this DVD?...
2,"Incredible Show. DVD release, not so much","This release is titled, ""Best DVD in the world"", yet is lacking the episode ""Best VHS in the world""? Doesn't make a whole lot of sense. Not to mention that episode is one of the best. This show absolutely needs full season releases. Let people experience such great episodes as ""Grave Sights"" and The Halloween Special."
1,Love Love Love this show,I love this show it is hilarious but I am NOT going to waste money buying bits and pieces of seasons. I am going to continue to record episodes on my DVR until they release a full season DVD. I recommend we all boycott this crap because its just ridiculous. If we dont buy this trash they wont sell it like this. Wait for a full season DVD release.
4,Just Wait,"They appear to be set on following the same pattern that Adventure Time did for its' DVD releases. Two compilation DVDs, then a season set (hopefully a set that includes both seasons one and two (like Shout! Factory's first Angry Beavers set), as season one could fit on a single disc). I'm sure that soon after the release of this compilation we'll get some sort of announcement concerning a more complete release."
3,There is no book. Great as a refresher.,"I am writing this review as someone who could already get by in French and has been fluent in Italian for many years. As I listen to these 8 CD's, I am surprising myself at how much French I've picked up and retained through the years (like ""Le cheval est mort."") So it's a great refresher course.I'm not sure how much I would get out of these CD's if I didn't already have some knowledge of French. Notice that I didn't say ""book"", because... there is no book.With these CD's, you may become conversant, but you won't be able to read anything in French or be able to pronounce it. But if ALL you want to do is speak & understand when spoken to, not being weighed down by trying to spell things in your head may be a good thing."
5,this fills a gap,"I liked this package for what it is. Good practice in comprehension. The first CD really does a good job of teaching pronunciation. It goes through vowels, consonants, and combinations. Lots of examples are given. Then, the course goes through all basic vocabulary: numbers, days of the week, weather... You get to listen to conversations and then answer questions about what you understood. I think there is much gained when you are unable to cheat by reading a conversation on a page. This package works especially well for people already familiar with French and those who have a french text lacking an audio component."
4,Good supplement,"Most of the self teaching material out there is books.This one has no book, as said by another reviewer.This is a good way to supplement your beginning French reading material with something that has audio.As with learning any language or skill, there is no ""one product"" that does it all.If you need a beginner level audio program to go with your beginning French reading material, this is a good selection.An easy way to get your French off the ground.This is for beginners, it is not for those who already have a solid grasp on French."
3,"Ok, but not as good as others I've used","Bought this to brush up on my French, which I haven't used for 15 yrs before a trip this fall. Is very good on pronunciations, but can be confusing. Goes through the French saying before translating in English. It seems backwards to me, but otherwise is a good product."
1,really?,"This product arrived on time, but I was so disappointed to see that the color was not that of my ""Candy"" shade of Estee Lauder lipstick that I was replacing. Neither the color or the texture were the same. Also, a clumsy label had been typed and cut out and pasted to the base of the lipstick. Guess I learned my lesson - I'll have to get the product from the Real source in order to get the Real thing."
3,Fresh fig scent unpleasant,"I bought this because it was listed as having a minimal amount of lead in it, but I don't like its scent. No scent would have been best. The color is fine."
2,might work in California,"I kind of liked this book, but (having read it a while ago) I only recall 2 things of any substance from it.First, approach men and get them to ask you out. This is the technique section, and I don't think it's particular strategies can work in my small town. There are just enough cultural differences from here to there that... well, I just don't see people acting this way.Second, do affirmations. Maybe this works for some people. I tried, maybe not too consistently, or long enough or hard enough, but really I tried, and here I am, still single however many months later.It's a pretty amusing book otherwise, reasonably well written and kind of fun, but in terms of actually helping, I don't think it doed the job."
1,How to meet quality men... in the 7-11?,"This author obviously has some strange ideas about what makes a quality man. I wouldn't want to date any man that would even consider going out with someone that he met in 7-11, which is exactly what the author suggests. This is beyond mercenary. Her suggested tactics are truly in bad form, suited to only the trashiest elements of society."
1,bummer,This case is not worth the money. It keeps ejecting the phone out of the case- on the ground. This is the exact problem I was trying to avoid.
1,terrible,"The case looks good in the picture and is described as something durable and great, but it's the total opposite. The other reviews posted detailed the main issue being the case door is not secure! Therefore not securing your phone... Might even make it even more susceptible to damages! Hate this case, dont buy it unless you intend to let it sit on your desk and never move it. Only has looks going for it."
1,casca trench soldier,"I read the first book in this series and my curiosity was rewarded with an above-average read and unique story. I jumped ahead to #21 The Trench Soldier and found an author at the end of his creativity, but worse, the laziest interpretation of one of the most documented wars in history. A realistic portrayal of daily life in WW1 trenches would have been interesting to a history junkie, and might have redeemed the time spent reading it. Instead, the author inexplicably tossed off made-up ""facts""about weaponry, and even referred to defending the Maginot line (wrong war altogether).Perhaps other eras were worth the author's effort. The concept of the series, of a man doomed to live forever as a soldier, from Roman times on, was well imagined and the first installment is recommended. As to the intervening books, I guess your chance for a good read is 50/50."
3,Digs a Trench thru your heart...,"Barry Sadler wrote such awesome and wonderful pulp fiction stories in the Casca series. Unfortunately, this isn't one of them. Decent in terms of reading about living on the streets of early turn-of-the-century America, along with war in WWI.But if I was a betting man, I'd bet this wasn't written by Barry. Perhaps partly, but not fully. The rough remnants of the Casca feel is there, but not as fully as past ones."
2,"Hotel Bemelmans, published by Overlook Press is abridged","Potential purchasers of Bemelman's lovely ""Hotel Bemelmans"" should know that as far as I can tell all the Hotel Bemelmans books advertised on Amazon is a shortened edition of the original Hotel Bemelmans published in 1946 by Viking Press. The books advertised here were published in 2000 by Overlook Press and contain 24 stories. The Viking Press edition has 36 stories. I learned this the hard way having purchased 3 copies of the shortened Overlook Press book. Some wonderful stories have been left out. e.g. Art at the Splendide. I have the original and am looking to buy some more."
4,Great yarns from a bon vivant,"Ludwig Bemelmans lived an incredibly full life. Writer of children's books (the Madelaine series), author of novels, painter of murals, waiter, bon vivant,restaurant owner, screen writer, artist, traveller, and apparently a non-stop bringer of joy to all who knew him, he arrived as a teenager from Germany and went to work in what he called the Hotel Splendide in his book Hotel Bemelmans, the actual hotel being the Ritz Carlton in New York City. This book details his co-workers, the hotel's regular customers, and his life as a waiter and banquet manager. At one point, Bemelmans is living in the William Randolph Hearst suite atop the hotel, owns a Hispano-Suiza, has his own butler, and has a chauffeur who can't drive so Bemelmans allows the chauffeur to dress up in his driving uniform, and sit in the back of the car while Bemelmans drives the car. Bemelmans is the kind of person you wish you'd known."
2,No! Please protect us from the reading of Douglas Wilmer,"For this 1998 recording, the biography of the reader Douglas Wilmer openly states that his first performance as Sherlock Holmes was in 1964.So here, 34 years later, we have our man reprising the role, but through the narrative of Dr Watson, who here sounds rather more like Santa Claus. At times, Wilmer appears to be confused whether he is playing Holmes or Watson, and will change voice mid-sentence.Avoid the Douglas Wilmer recordings at all costs. They are intensely irritating, and ruin what are still half-decent stories."
1,Inconsistent,"This movie is listed among the selections from Suzanne Bier. It is not by her. However, she did make a well received movie by the same name (when translated) in 1999. Any ideas where to find it with English subtitles? Thanks"
3,DVD puchased,My wife wanted this movie and we found it. It was not cheap at $49 but she really wanted it. Here in California the DVD region is 1 not 2. So until we purchase a DVD player that will play all regions we watched the movie on the computer.I was not happy that a region 2 DVD arrived. The sender should have known better.
4,A VERY DECENT ALBUM:,"I bought this one for my wife, who really enjoys `Rush'. Geddy Lee's singing has usually put me off, a bit, although I have always considered `Rush' to be one of the more intelligent Rock bands going: the songs are well written and the musicianship is first-rate. I was pleasantly surprised by this one because, for whatever reason, Lee wasn't screeching and screaming as much so his vocals were a lot more palatable. As usual, the musicianship and songwriting were right ""up there"" and the title cut is one of my favorites on the album. Definitely worth a listen."
3,Filler-Filled,"Even though the album helped Rush get back to Guitar Rock, and regardless of the fact that there were much needed ""hits"" on this record, it still stands alongside RUSH and TEST FOR ECHO as the worst Rush records. The songs Dreamline and Bravado are amazing, not to mention perfect. Roll the Bones and Ghost of a Chance are ""OK"", but everything else is total filler. There are some brutally dated moments here, moments which are debatably worse than any of the skinny ties and pink loafers of the Power Windows period. I'm looking at you, White-Boy Rap.Look, Rush is one of the best bands of all time, and pretty much every album is fabulous, but this one is slightly less good than PRESTO (while keeping it's bad, thin production), and doesn't come close to the heights they would scale next with COUNTERPARTS, their best 90's effort.Get this album last, or almost last."
2,A 4 star average?,"That's hard to believe. I'm a big Rush fan, from the point of view of their entire catalog, but this is definitely one of the weak spots. I think ""Big Wheel"" and ""Ghost of a Chance"" are OK, ""Roll the Bones"" is a mediocre radio tune, and the rest is very forgettable IMO. Not sure what caused Rush's decline. They certainly had some good moments after Moving Pictures, but on the other hand they seem to have been in steady decline ever since. Nope, can't recommend this one."
2,Am I alone? This is Rush's worst.,"I must come from a different planet. I think Presto is fantastic and horribly underrated. Counterparts is a 50/50 album. Have the stuff is excellent, half is junk. Roll the Bones is just lame. With the exception of Ghost of a Chance, all of the songs seem uninspired, as if the band members were forced by their mothers to record this album when what they really wanted to do was go outside and play.Heresy is probably the worst song Neil ever penned.Fortunately, they have recovered."
2,Can't stand this Rush album! (2 stars for 2 good songs),"I love Rush, I really do, but even now, when I tried to give it a listen, it still sounds like the worst thing that Rush has done (beside Test for Echo) I am really surprised that Rush fans love this album. I just don't get any kinda of vibe from this album. Even though Dreamline and Ghost of a Chance are good songs, the rest seems like filler material. I give it two stars for those two good songs, but otherwise I really can't recommend this. If you want Rush from the 1990's, go with Counterparts. Its easily a 5 star effort and the best from that decade"
2,Rush falls off a cliff with this one,"Rush's worst album since Caress of Steel brought to an abrupt end a very strong run of releases that had begun with Hemispheres in 1978. Nevertheless, the album is not without its positives. Dreamline is one of the band's great songs, and there are other good ones, like Bravado, and You Bet Your Life. Face Up, The Big Wheel, and Where's My Thing make for passable filler. The rest, though, is unlistenable garbage, whether it's the strikingly awful rapping in the title track, or the dreadful run of songs ""Heresy/Ghost of a Chance/Neurotica"" that surely represent the three worst consecutive tracks -- ever -- on a Rush album. When an album has stuff on it that is so terrible that you'd be embarrassed to play the CD in front of other people, it's pretty bad. When it's a RUSH album that does this, its pretty depressing. Download Dreamline and skip this one."
1,Rush at their most uninspired.,"My this is a toothless old affair. Easily their worst album. The real Rush was over after "" Hold Your Fire"". If this was anyone's first experience with the band I don't see how they would find them interesting. By this time they had moved so far away from what put them on the map anyway. If a group debuted with a record like this I doubt any self respecting label would give them a shot to do it again. For fans of tired millionare rock only"
1,Boring and lacklustre,"Bad effort by RUSH. A IRon Maiden, Van Halen, Def Leppard, Ozzy and others artists, they just can't be so great anymore."
3,the return of Rush playing rock music,"Not the best of Rush's works but marked a return to form. After awful synth heavy 80's Rush was ready to rock and Roll the Bones shows this. The guitar is finally back to the front of the mix and the keys/synths are kept mostly as accents and background noise. The first three are great songs ""bravado"" being the best. The title is great except for an outdated yet fan favorite ""rap"" section. After ""Where's My Thing?"" the album just falls into mediocrity containing one of the worst songs in Rush's history with ""Heresy"". It is another outdated song about the fall of communism and looks at the perspective of ""now what?"" A cool idea for 1991 but 16 years later it is just well, lame. Plus the music to ""Heresy"" isn't all that great either. Standouts are ""Dreamline"" and ""Bravado"". Track to avoid: ""Heresy""."
4,Roll the Bones,"When cassettes were the ""in"" thing, I had this album. Then along came CD's and I bought it in CD. I think that should sum up what I think about this album. It's awesome."
2,"Except for three masterpieces, it all blends together","Funny how time puts everything in perspective...When Roll the Bones first came out I thought it was great--their best album since Signals. BUT, I've been listening to Rush's entire catalogue recently and this one really pales in comparison to most of the other albums. ""Dreamline,"" ""Bravado,"" and ""Ghost of a Chance"" are some of the best work they've ever done (especially lyrically), but the rest of the album sounds very commercial, trite, and bland. But of course, compared to most other bands,it's great...I just expect more out of Rush."
1,Stay away.,"I am a Rush fan and a completist, which is the only reason I bought this CD in the first place. I figured that since the remastering was done this year, the sound quality might be a slight improvement over the 1997 remaster. I compared the two versions side by side, and was surprised to hear immediately that the new version is vastly inferior. Furthermore, this version comes with no packaging or liner notes that the 1991 or 1997 versions don't already have. Summary: Absolute waste of money. Are you listening? Do not buy this product."
3,Rush raps,"Rush must have been influenced by the growing influence of rap on all aspects of our culture at the time. Otherwise how else can you explain that laughingstock title track ? Rush raps.I thought long and hard about how to judge this album and it boils down to this: you have to give the band props for trying some new things here, even if the results are awkward and lamentable. 'Dreamline' IS easily one of the best Rush songs since Red Barchetta, so 1 star for that song by itself. Another star for 'Ghost of A Chance', though much more a personal favorite than artistic leap forward. I bestow a third star as there are moments on this album where it feels as if Rush is going to recapture some of their past glory, and for the first 5 to 6 minutes, they succeed."
4,Rush goes pop!,"'Bones' continues from where 'Presto' left off, and is a slight improvement on its predecessor. This is probably Rush's most commercial release ever, even more so than 'Permanent Waves' 11 years previously. Tracks like 'Face Up' and 'Dreamline' are as radio-friendly as any music could possibly be, but they still have that unique Rush stamp on them. 'Ghost of a Chance' is the most 'indulgent' track, combining two songs into one and has some wonderful solo work from Alex. Neil and Geddy are once again at their brilliant best, and I rate this as one of Rush's best five albums."
3,A change every album,"Roll the Bones is more of a return to the way Rush used to be. The keyboards were toned down quite a bit on Presto, but on here even more. The album's not bad, but not very interesting. ""Ghost of a Chance"" is good though. Geddy Lee's vocals are more relaxed and mellow. They change every album."
3,This album is weak...,It is probably their old age....but i think Roll the Bones is one of Rush's weakest works...gone were the days of Power Windows and Hold Your Fire. Lets hope their succeeding works redeem them.
5,One of the Greatest Rush albums,"This was the first Rush album I bought and was certainly not the last. When I first heard this album I was blown away by the song structures somehow simple yet complex. Every song on this album is awesome (unlike most of counterparts) and I'm glad this is the first Rush album I heard. ""Dreamline"", ""bravado"", ""roll the bones"" and ""ghost of a chance"" are easily Rush classics but the other songs which some have reffered to as ""fillers"" are just as good especially ""bet your life"" and ""the big wheel"". This album seems to be part ""hold your fire"" and part ""counterparts"". I think ""Roll the bones"" is the last great rock n roll album and certainly one of Rushs' very finest.5 outta 5!!!!"
3,Good,"Rush thankfully ditches keyboards and synthesizers in this album to return to a more rock style. The lyrics are also very good espicially in ""roll the bones"" which seems to show a almost opposite view of their earlier song ""free will."" The song is partly ruined however by the attempts of ""rap"" in it, that is not how to do a good rock song. Bravado is another good instrumental, the album is a little disaprorinate with songs that are not as good such as ""the big wheel"""
4,Well...Good.,"Features one of the better SONGS by Rush, but this is not their loudest album at all (or even to the date of it's release). Of course, I think ""Ghost of a Chance"" is right up there with ""Free Will"" and ""Far Cry"" for best Rush take ever. I also love the longer ""2112"" as well, but in a much different way. Either way, this album explores some things I could say are almost necessary to one's collection."
4,A nice gift for someone who has lost a loved one,"This book is a very nice gift for someone who has lost a loved one. Particularly, if the person that has passed is young. This book was given to me when I lost a very good friend in high school, and now, years later, in the unfortunate instance when someone I know and love loses someone else, I always give this book as a gift, in hopes it can provide comfort to someone else."
4,Sexy Rednecks Get Killed by College Bimbos,"Two really hot rednecks are unfortunately killed by two ex college roomies who apparantly have nothing better to do then get together once a year to remember (choke) their college days.They start out as a trio and thankfully one of them is done away with early on. The other two kill the sexy rednecks and then their retarded mother. I mean really...the only interesting people in this film are the redneck boys and then those college morons killed them. Thankfully at the end, the maniacal QUEENIE jumps out and gives those girls WHAT FOR for murdering her hot nephews.I was rooting for the rednecks all the way. If I had met them I would have asked them for a date. Why are women always turning down advances by such hot guys. What is a dude to do when women are always killing the hottest trade?"
2,"If you like trash, you will LOVE this","Okay, so it's not ALL bad. It has its moments of gore, but it was not NEARLY as gory as i expected it to be. The story goes like this: Three annoying women, who have been friends forever go on a trip to the woods. They are captured by an old lady and her two stupid redneck sons. One of the girls is beaten and raped, the others escape and want revenge. The ending wil make you think ""what the...."" and then you will laugh. Buy it if you love trash, otherwise don't!"
5,One of the best...,"This is a very demented, twisted, horror film. Would be VERY contraversial if it was released in this day and age. If you like horror and haven't seen this, I would suggest doing so and will bet you'll love it. It's over-the-top and actually quite suspenseful. For a dollar more, certainly get the blu if you have the means to watch it in that format. A vastly under rated 80's classic gets another chance come June. JUST BUY IT!!!"
5,Hard to rate,"I did include a star rating, but it's difficult for me, especially when other's are relying an my opinion. So all I can tell you is that I like the movie a lot, because: 1. it's a classic, 2. it's well acted and well made, 3. the female characters played great and their friendship really comes to life in the film, 4. it stands shoulder to shoulder with Day of the Woman (aka I spit on your grave).That's in short why I gave the movie a five star rating, but beware if you are sensitive to and dislike misogynistic content, then you should avoid this movie at all costs."
4,CLASSIC 80's HORROR to the BONE!!!!!!,the dvd comes out looking & sounding great! it comes with a few extras & then your buried in troma extras up to your eye balls(what else is new!???)anyway I LOVE THIS FLICK!!!its spoooky & goooooooooofy as hell & it brings me right back to when i was 7-8-9-10 years old & renting any horror flick that had a cool/scary cover & cool/scary pictures on the back from my local mamas & papas video store. i can't believe that i found this on dvd & i thank TROMA for putting it out on dvd BIG TIME!!!!!so hurry up & get this great cheeeeeezzze fest of an 80's flick & E!N!J!O!Y!
5,Mother's Day All Time Favorite Horror!,I First Saw this Movie When I Was About 9 Or 10 Years Old Back In 1984 Or 1985 At My Mom And Dad's Friends House I Still Remember Watching It When I Was A Kid It Scared Me To Death I Found The Mother In That Movie To Be Very Creepy The Scenes That Bring Back Memories Are Queenie At The End Of The Movie The Sleeping Bag Seen The 2 Hippies In The Car With Mother I Am A Huge 70's & 80's And Semi 90's Horror Buff But This Movie Here Is My All Time Favorite Horror I Lent This Movie To 5 Or 6 Of My Friends And They Are Horror Buffs They Have Never Heard Of This Movie Before And They Watched It And They Loved It I Have To Give Hats Off To Charles Kaufman For Making The Best Horror Movie Of All Time!
1,Sick vision of a womanhater's fantasies!!!,"This movie rates as the worst piece of trash ever released! Two hillbilly sicko's and their equally deranged mother, kidnap three colledge girls and proceed to rape and torture them. When two escape, they plan their revenge, which results in the death of the mother and her two sons. This film is far from enertainment and should never have been released. A disgrace to the horror genre!"
1,this film's an old bag..just like mother,"This was one of the worst horror movies I have ever seen.It's about a twisted family of 2 psychos and their deranged mother..thats it!,,there is 3 girls who are captured by the.Well lets call them the TWISTO BROS. They torture rape and kill while mommy watches. One good scene in the movie when this hippieschmuk gets his head lopped off in the car.Otherwise it's an unimaginative movie, special effects [stink],if you want there's a stupid scene where the girls get revengewhen TWISTO BRO #1 gets some Drano and a TV jammed on his head..sheesh what schlok! forget this clunker"
1,A really bad black comedy,"Mother's Day is a stupid movie with two nasty rednecks named Ike and Addly that kidnap three girls and bring them back to their trashy house were their equally nasty mother teaches them to kill them. The movie is disgusting and really poorly made with unlikable charcters,bad acting,and a plot that is really badly written. The only funny parts is when Ike eats his breakfast from a swill bucket and when the girls are returning back to the house and go in side and stand beside the table and a second later Ike jumps out of nowhere."
1,Who's Kidding Who,"I saw this move when it came out. It is one of the worst I have ever seen. One review said that the special effects were pretty good. The one that stands out is one of the brothers spewing alka-seltzer foam after getting a television smashed over his head. This is a 5 star movie? I don't think so, unless ""THE BIG BUS"" is an Oscar contender."
4,"B-Grade, Demented See It!!","Ike and Addley are two comically moronic brothers (who by their looks may have had different papas) living in the woods of New Jersey with their sweet smiling but twisted mama. When a trio of women reuniting from college for a camp out, meet this freak family, suspense, bloodshed and yes, even comedy ensue.Fans of B-Videos, Troma and ""women in peril"" all have something to love here."
5,good old horror movie,Movie is good but.it was better when I was a kid now I see how.simple and funny.it.is.and.it's supposed to be horror lol getting.old.sucks .
4,ye gods! a 13-year-old reading political books!,"This book was...interesting. I would have liked some proof of some of the information, while on subjects like food and the environment, for all our sakes I can only hope he was exaggerating.The best things in this book are the tongue-in-cheek intros, outlandish though they are.Overall, this book was pretty good. Not the best read if you're a Republican seeing if you should swing your vote, but it's good for Democrats to get a laugh."
4,"Any criticism of current office-holders is ""hate""?","There are no perfect sides to take in politics. We can only fulfill our obligation to this country and our fellow countrymen by being inquisitive, willing to listen, and being able to make up our own minds without the need to lambaste others who do not share our 'family values' or belief in the current 'plutocracy'.Before we get our panties in a twist over a dissenting voice perhaps we should do some research on the author, his experience, his justifications, and make an intelligent, correctly spelled retort, or commendation. Jeez, as far as I know, it's still a free country, unless the 'hatred' perceived by the rabid right shuts down dissent altogether."
1,What happened?,"I had researched information relating to the Merkaba meditation and was hoping that this video (Holistic Highway to Wisdom) would provide me with a step by step instructional, only to find that this man (David Hulse D.D.) was pitching tuning forks and other merchandise along with workshop formats. At the end there is a short meditation but certainly not something that a beginner would be able to use, nor the information necessary to follow up etc. I suppose I thought that this CD would instruct me on the Merkaba, its meditations, and uses; I was very wrong!"
1,Worst Book Ever,This book could have been written in Arabic for all I know. Could understand one idea.
4,Great book; needs lodging update,"We used this book to plan a great spring 2000 dog vacation. The hiking rating system is excellent, as are her other suggestions on what to do. Many of the lodgings, however, had changed hands or policies. Still, we were able to find great places to stay with our dog."
5,Was written with a sense of humor,Sense of humor comes through and it is informative. Details of trails are mentioned in here that may not be mentioned anywhere else and are good to know so you are not surprised my them once you are out on the trail. I have not been able to hike any of the trails in the book yet but have a good idea where I am gonna start after reading.
3,So-so brush,"While the handle is certainly up to WMF quality standards, the bristles stain and fall out fairly easily. I can imagine that the brush will wear out too soon to justify the price of the stainless handle. Eh, but it looks nice with the rest of the collection."
4,"A little expensive for 25 minutes, but worth the money.","I've seen lots of footage reguarding the events of Sept. 11, 2001. This video simply documents what happened on that day without the melodramatic attachments of personal stories designed to tug on your heart-strings. If you want a documentary of what happened, this is it."
4,La historia continúa,El libro es básicamente el mismo estilo de sus predecesores de la serie Dejados Atrás. La trama sigue interesante a lo largo de este libro. Estoy ansioso por terminarlo para comenzar con el próximo.
3,Don't really need this,"i bought this mag with my first spring loaded airsoft gun (m16) b/c i thought that i would be needing to fill up often. Turns out, the mag that comes with the gun was all i needed. as for performance, this mag performed well but the plastic feel and the shaking motion needed to fill up the mag detract from it's overall rating."
1,Ok time to stop the series!,"I own 1-14 of the series and this is by far the worst to date, they have really stopped trying! All tracks were very similar, bland mix of easy listening and was cheesy in places, Don't Bother!"
1,Rubbish,"I've got *every* one of the albums, along with several of the Dreams. I have noticed degradation of the quality of the last few compilations, but this one is WAY off the mark. The absolute worst. Insulting to their loyal following. Somebody's gotta put a stop to this! Except for the first track, the album is uninspiring, uninteresting, soul-less muzak. I'm done with subsidizing Cafe del Mar -- this was my last purchase."
2,less than average,"this is not a good prep book, one may wish to buy this book only for its tests, it has 4 tests that are close to the real but the price is too much for just 4 tests"
1,"too easy, inaccurate, incomplete",I bought this book with great expectations and I ended up with complete frustration just on the day when I saw the real test! This book is just not the right choice. It makes you feel good because you are able to move fast through the chapters but you end up doing very few examples most of which are a lot more easier than the reality. There are so many details I have not ever seen in Kaplan's book. Moreover tests are old fashioned and completely inaccurate. I am currently working with Barron's review books and Meylani's tests and I recommend you to do the same.
5,This is one baby album you'll love to use. It's beautiful!,"This album has beautiful illustrations throughout, with appropriate quotes and verses that are both amusing and profound. The pop-up features make it all the more fun to write in the mini and major milestones in your baby's life. I wish I had one when my kids were babies!"
5,Some people's lives - Bette Midler,"A very good, but not commonly known album of Bette Midler. Certainly comparable in quality with The Rose."
5,Bette Midler,"I am known for long reviews so I will try to make this short. This is her best album. She sings everything. Big Band (""Miss Otis....), Pop (""One More Round""), Ballads (""The Girl Is On To You"" and Dance (""Moonlight Dancing""). And once again, she succeeds in all arenas. But IMHO, this album is worth it just for one song. ""He was Too Good To Me/ Since You Stayed Here"". Now, these are two completely different tunes. The first being a Laura Nyro covered tune and the other coming from I don't know where. She combines both soooo beautifully though. The piano complements her voice soooo beautifully and ""Since You Stayed Here"" leaves you melancholy and yearning. I love many vocalists but this one right here is the only one that can actually have me feel something with just one word or lyric. HIGHLY recommended!"
5,One of Bette's Best,"This was one of the first Bette Midler albums I ever bought (I have since gotten all of her earlier work) as I loved the song ""Night and Day."" I was so impressed with the remainder of the album that it remains one of my all-time favorites. The best in my opinion are, ""He Was Too Good to Me/Since You Stayed Here,"" ""The Girl Is On to You,"" and the title track. Excellent album!"
3,CLASSIC BETTE,"Bette really does know what her fans like. This album has it all camp (""One More Round"" ""Miss Otis Regrets""), dance pop (""Moonlight Dancing'), and over the top ballads (""From A Distance""). But there is something about this album that just leaves me cold. ""He Was Too Good To Me"" is sort of bland for my tastes, and ""The Gift of Love"" while it is a catchy piece of pop fluff, sounds too much like ""The Eternal Flame"" by the Bangles. Most likely because it was written in part by Susannah Hoffs. Probably an outake from her solo album that was released around the same time as Bette's. I know Bette's fans love this record but if your checking her out for the first time, try ""Songs for the New Depression"", or ""No Frills"", or ""Bette"" before this one."
5,Extra-special CD,"I owned the tape for years and now I have the CD! This is Bette at her best! From the emotional piece ""Day and Night"" to the popular ""From A Distance"" it's a must own!"
5,The Danielle Steel Value Collection,Danielle STeel is a wonderful author and Her marvolous talent is shown in the three book value pack
4,Bands this consistent usually don't live long,"It's sometimes hard to think there are really anymore pleasing melodies out there, but thank Halstead & co. for proving me wrong. I am happily pleased with their latest, and very eagerly awaited, effort. Instead of the depths of melancholia and loveliness on, say, OUT OF TUNE, they give us 41+ minutes of what seems like basically ""it's good, everything's going just way OK..."" It's happy. Maybe I'll hear a lyric later that says something else, but for those for whom music is the priority, you can't go wrong with this considered and experienced and artful pop. Four and a half stars."
5,Made a great Christmas gift,This book made a great Christmas gift for my 9 year old grandson who loves to read about American History
5,PETER LORRE,"This is such a classic movie. Parts of it was banned due to the content, but I am pleased that it came out in a set. Black & whites are filled with mood lighting,"
3,The eyes of a reenactor,"When you watch this dvd....you can see it is made for a town hero, and not just to make a film of the Civil War. Now with that sayed, the dvd is nice in the way it was done. But since I am a Civil War Reenactor, and do the things seen in this dvd almost every weekend, I can see alot of little things that drive me nuts. Like there is a part where a A soldier puts on his bayonet and does not lock it, and pretends to use it, and the whole time I am waiting for it to fall off. I know that sounds petty, but when you do it and see it done wrong and can drive you nuts. Besides that, the acting is bad, and sound almost as bad, but beside that, the way it is done is fresh and if you can get away from the things that get to me, and you enjoy knowing new storys from the eyes of someone who was there, and have a love of the Civil War, then this dvd is for you."
5,Excellent...,"I have several pieces of Emile Henry and love them all. This in particular is very useful for serving four or two with left-overs. In addition to Au Gratin potatoes, good for roasting root veggies, or anything really. Cleans up nice, but flat top handles prone to some staining... not sure how that happened, all other pieces I have don't have that issue, but this is my favorite nonetheless."
3,Size Matters,"The product description said this dish has a two quart capacity. In reality, it has a six cup or one and a half quart capacity. I bought it for a specific recipe and I'll make it work...cause it's so stinkin' cute...but I was not happy with the size discrepancy."
3,Psycho Thriller,A shrink tries to help a young man threatening to commit suicide on his 21st birthday but it turns out that the doctor might be crazier than the patient he is trying to help when everyone he claims to talk to starts being identified as dead for years. Not bad...bit confusing at times.
1,unfortunate,"This movie was touted as a ""dramatic thriller"", and turned out to be anything but. As supernatural as War and Peace (and twice as hard to follow), Stay is more of an indy-artsy-sad movie than true thrill ride. With plenty of dizzying camera shots and a non-sensical ending to boot, the movie leaves the viewer feeling rather disheartened and wishing they'd stayed long enough at Blockbuster to pick another movie."
2,Dont Stay !,"Boring, Boring, Boringi don't know if its just me or the movie is really boring , so go ahead and rent it instead of buying it ,im a big fan of Ewen but this is one of his worst performing ?"
1,So Bad!,This movie made no sense and was really stupid. It's about nothing. The cast is full of great actors giving very poor performances. Naomi Watts is a soap opera actress who has had too much botox. This movie has about as much imagination as a Michael Jackson video.
2,Just not Satisfied with knowing nothing.....(1.5 Stars),"I know that some people may see this low review and instantly dismiss it, but I beg those few to hear me out. I wanted to love this movie, I like all kinds of films and the movie's premise and dark style drew me in and led me to buy it. Let me start and say Ryan Gosling is one of my favorite young actors, Bob Hoskins I've loved since ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"", and director Marc Forster is a good one. That being said the film doesn't ultimately make any sense, atleast in my mind. If that doesn't bother you, then that is fine. The acting is good, there are some intense scenes, some people may be dead, or in a dreamlike state but I couldn't honestly tell you to save my life. What I do know is that I truly love movies..and I have never left a movie feeling so ultimately unsatisfied as I did after ""Stay""."
3,Vascilates between intriguing and dull.,"There is too much going on in this movie to be relaxing or completely enjoyable. The plot was so muddled that, despite wanting to give-up after 40 minutes of viewing, I continued to watch because I couldn't fathom what the movie was about. At the end of the movie, it becomes clear that a dying man runs through events in a confusing way.Contemplating the meaning of the movie was fun. Photography was very artsy and well-done. Overall it was worth watching."
4,"Awesome, mind-bending flick",Outstanding flick that is extremely unique. Very cerebral. Highly recommended for anybody who likes those types of movies. All-in-all....great movie!
2,"I liked it much better when it was called ""Jacob's Ladder""","Obviously, this film is designed to provoke post-film conversation with its ""twist"" of an ending. The movie is well-shot, but compelling imagery does not make a great feature film. For those who are interested, the plot was lifted directly from the much creepier, much less artier, and much more emotionally compelling, and much more realized 'Jacob's Ladder'."
2,Strange Little Movie!,"Didn't enjoy this movie and wouldn't recommend it at all! Too confusing and difficult to untangle the plot lines and figure out which scenario was real and which one was not, except for maybe the beginning and ending. Felt the screenplay tried to be too artsy and during the bulk of the movie to keep the audience guessing as to what was really going on. Ripoff!!"
2,Great cast but what a mess!,"Who put this mess together? Some of the best actors in the business, but even if one watched it slightly stoned (and I didn't!), this movie would be a confusing mess. Sorry, guys. Better luck next time!"
4,Some very good acting here,Where memory and reality mix in the mind of a psychiatristand his patient... we get a ghost effect.Some people want to save what is already gone.In places this is like replaying the movie in a tape player.At times it jumps ahead; the effect is one of telling the storyof a lonely young artist.The abstract art of a movie and the lives of the people involved.It is an art movie....
5,what is real?,"Stay is an excellet movie. as other reviews say, do not mistake this movie for a horror film. It is a movie that is a complete ""mind freak"" and will have you questioning what is real and what is not. Although the beginning may seem a little slow, it is defenatley worthwhile. By the time the movie is over you will be quentioning what has happened. all though this moive may not be appleaing to some people, it is still a great movie raising questions beyond its ending. I fully reccomend this moive to anyone."
4,Fascinating film,"A gorgeously-shot, intricately assembled puzzle. Marc Forster's film before his delightfully original ""Stranger Than Fiction,"" ""Stay"" is full of subtle eye candy tricks that hint all along where it's going, and establishes Forster as a director with strong, visual/cinematic ideas.I picked up the DVD based on the cast and the cost (it was, sadly, steeply discounted), and didn't realize it was Forster's work. I'd read no reviews, had no awareness of the film from its theatrical release, and watched it ""cold."" I'm so glad I did.I look forward to turning my movie-loving friends onto this gem -- it really is a treat for those who love a good puzzle, who like to watch good actors having fun with layered characters, and for anyone who thinks there aren't enough directors with a painter's imagination -- who treat film as a canvas and approach stories with an insightful, visual flair."
5,Head Trauma...,"STAY is one of those odd little movies that seem to make no sense until the very end. Like CARNIVAL OF SOULS, JACOB'S LADDER, DARK CORNERS, MULLHOLLAND DRIVE, INLAND EMPIRE, etc., STAY creates a mysterious, alternate universe where dream and reality intersect. Psychiatrist, Dr. Sam Foster (Ewan McGregor), his girlfriend, Lila Culpepper (Naomi Watts), and his new patient Henry Letham (Ryan Gosling) are caught up in a shifting nightmare-scape of unraveling sanity. Sam is especially intrigued by Henry's story and his seemingly psychic, almost supernatural abilities. Sam is drawn into Henry's world, which eventually bleeds through and overtakes his own. There are many ""WTF?"" moments! We are left to be just as confused and confounded as Sam. However, if we can hold on until the final act, we will be rewarded w/ an inovative conclusion. I was impressed..."
5,Most underrated film of the year,"I have never seen a film that got me involved on such a deep level of creativity. Every single scene change was deeply thought out. Every line, action, outfit, setting, and even extras were deeply thought out. This is the most impressive directing and writing I can remember seeing. See this movie. Listen to Marc Forster's Podcast on Itunes and do your research to get more enjoyment out of every little fact about the film."
2,Less than impressed,"Movie arrived and I was less than impressed from the get go. It was rated as ""in good condition"" when I purchased it, but when I pulled it out of the shipping envelope, the case looked really old and damaged. The cardboard movie cover looked like it had water damage and was stuck to the plastic case. I had to spend 5 minutes getting it off, tearing it in the process, before I could even open the movie case. The disc was floating around inside when I finally got it open."
1,Purchased this on the basis of other reviews,"Let me tell you, I will be in the minority on this film. First of all,it's a mess. You assemble fine actors and a reasonable story. Then constrain them with horrible lines and bad writing.All of the charactors have had some distrubing incident. (like that will make them more interesting)I guess it was to give them a common thread.I watched hoping this film would get better,but by the mid-way point I didn't care.The ending if you call it that, was the most disappointing.If I was suppose to be entertained I wasn't. Don't waste your money renting this grooner!"
1,stay away,"I totally agree with Steve Mcintosh's review. Couldn't have said it better. A movie should not be rated as a great movie simply because of its visuals but rather it should be rated highly based on its synopsis and plot. One other thing - for all of you reviewers out there who write stay is a good movie and who recommend seeing it a second time you couldn't be more wrong. I would only watch a movie a second time if I really enjoyed watching it for the first time. Seeing a movie a second time to understand it better/more completly really suggests that the movie was a horrible piece of work whose audience cannot even follow in one round. This movie however, is not totally and utterly horrible - it is possible to sit through it (unlike other movies I've seen, namely, in the bedroom, closer and match point) if you really have the time and are curious."
4,Watch it 3 times,"This happens to be one of my favorite films. Every time you watch it, you catch a detail that you missed before. I think once you understand the concept that the film isn't confusing at all---in fact it is rather beautiful in a very bittersweet way."
4,A Fascinating Mind Trip,"I had to watch this movie twice before I actually understood everything that was going on. Not long into my first viewing, I began to realize the surreality of it and began to think that it was a dream, I thought at first, was in Sam Foster's mind. The ending was a complete surprise and I decided I had to have a second look to pick out all the clues that led to it. The performances were all stellar, although I must admit I am a huge Ewan McGregor fan, which was the main reason I saw this film to begin with. Although it's a little confusing the first time around, and it's important not to miss anything, it's worth the time to sit down and watch it...watch twice and you just might get even more out of it."
3,Silly,I don't know what the heck this movie is about. It plays with bending time and reality. It's kinetic...too much so. It comes across as chaotic rather than thought provoking. It's set in NY but to me it seemed like Dickens' London which was disorienting. Death seems to be the subject and the cause of death is suicide. Very grim. Needlessly grim in my opinion and what was the obsession with McGregor wearing white socks with his pants short enough to see them? Were they trying to say he was attempting to out run death?
3,Watch It More Than Once!,"A bit srange and confusing, but worth a second view. Not really a ""thriller"" or ""Horror"" movie as you may assume from the DVD case notes and description. this is one of those films that when it's finished you will sit around and discuss what the director was trying to say or you might just go ""Huh?"""
4,It'll hit you with something different.,"This movie was very well done in the aspect of bringing suspense and confusion to this complex genre. This movie has a great degree of acting and mood, all the scenes are not seperated with simple cuts but are blended together . . . and you'll find out why. It has a knack for taking what you think is going to happen and totally flipping it upside down. Bob hoskins also did a breakthrough performance with Ryan Gosling( Guy from The Notebook).But, you may have to watch this movie a second time in order to be blown away and connect all the missing pieces."
5,Great cheap enclosure for mounting drives!,"We use this at work (deskside) for mounting users' hard drives all the time. You can just take it apart and use the end to quickly and temporarily mount drives onto other computers. This can work with both 3.5"" and 2.5"" drives but if it's the 3.5"" you need to plug in both USB ports, if it's just the 2.5"" drive just plug the main cable in.I am sure it's good for its intentional use as well. But if you don't want to pay the $20+ for a drive caddy, this works just as well!"
1,Do not waste your money,I purchased this HDD enclosure about 3 days ago. My USB connection keeps dropping out preventing backups and moving of large files. Do not buy this product.
5,"Excellent, but better packaging could be utilized","Grear product but packaging could have been better, almost lost screws due to the Baggie they were in slipped out unnoticed when I took the case out of the box,"
5,An excellent option to reuse my old sata drive,"I am really happy of having decided to buy this enclosure together with my new sata hard file, for a few money I am still using my old drive and it was also a great help to move all my data from the old one into the new one.It came with everything, including a little screw driver that was very usefull considering the size of the screws."
4,Good for price but not the best,"I bought this enclosure so I could clone my hard drive on my laptop to the 250gb WD 2.5 inch sata hard drive I bought. This enclosure is good for such things and now it holds my old hard drive which I use as a backup. Sometimes the enclosure wont work, I would have to unplug it and plug it in back onto my laptop until the hard drive was picked up. other than that its an ok product, transfer speeds aren't that bad and this is a good item so it can store your hard drive as a back-up and I wouldn't recommend traveling around with it since it doesn't look very road durable."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!!,"I CANNOT GET IT TO WORK, VERY CHEAP MATERIAL!!! DO NOT BUY THIS....THE HARD DRIVE GETS DISCONNECTED EVERYTIME I SECURE IT WITH THE SCREWS, IT ONLY WORKS FROM TIME TO TIME WHEN I ONLY SET UP THE SATA CONNECTORS AND HOLD THE HARD DRIVE WITH MY BOTH HANDS, SO WHATS THE POINT OF HAVING THIS ENCLOSURE???"
1,SATA enclosure,"The enclosure looks nice and cable is OK too. No problems to assembly the components nor to find screws... however, the driver doesn't work. I tried to install it in 2 different computers but still not working... don't know what to do. Perhaps the company should provide a CD with the driver? or a more specific url for the driver? whatever solution they find will be better than to have the enclosure at home... but not working!"
2,Works but pieces don't fit together,I bought two of these enclosures. Both work as advertised for my Macbook drives. BUT the main body is supposed to attach to the black end cap with two small screws. For both of my enclosures the screws didn't fit no matter how hard I tried. Poor quality construction.There are other enclosures that are cheaper and better. I'm buying two of those to replace these. Hope you don't make the same mistake...
2,did I order the wrong size?,"Technically this should be the right size, but it doesn't quite fit my hard drive from my macbook (which got fried from a water spill on the keyboard). Also it says it has two screws on the side, but I couldn't find them. I gave it two because it still works. I just have to be careful with it..."
2,Lasted a few months,It was ok for the price at first. the two tiny little screws are a pain. i use it a lot to transfer from my computer to my PS3. the usb port on it kept getting looser until it snapped off in the inside. its pretty cheap. i take care my things and i was surprised to see this happen. i'd recommend an IMicro 2.5 SATA and IDE combo enclosure. cheap and durable. bought one in a computer store for $23.
1,Broken after 3 times of plug/unplug,"Have two drives both from Western Digital. Swith them in and out of this, StarTech SAT2510U2 InfoSafe 2.5-Inch USB/SATA Hard Drive Enclosure, only 3 times then no longer works!Not a reliable product. Anyone knows other reliable enclosure to recommend?"
1,"UPDATED REVIEW, Find something else!","When I first got this thing, I was happy with it, it did its job easily and well. I only had to use it a few times to get some data off an old laptop drive, so I used it maybe 5-6 times.I can no longer recommend this product because the USB plug has broken off the internal circuit board rendering the unit unusable. And that is only after maybe half a dozen times plugging and unplugging the USB cable.I suppose if you plug it in once, and then never unplug it, you might be happy, but don't expect any kind of durability out of this thing.OLD REVIEW BELOW___________________________________Not a lot to say, except this thing works. The drive fits in easily and without having to shoe horn it in. I did a lot of research and this one seemed like the best compromise between price and quality. I am happy with the item and recommend it to anyone needing a 2.5 inch drive enclosure."
2,"Garbage,don't buy","This product is cheap metal not worthy, however I have to say it works, but it is not well made."
3,Works but needs more power than a laptop provides for some things,"It works great when you're just doing everyday file transferring and moving back and forth; but as soon as you try and format the thing, partition or repair it (if you do these sort of things), you won't be doing this on a Macbook (Aluminum 2008 Unibody). It took me a few hours to realize that the dang thing needed more power than the macbook would output.I had to connect it to my iMac, format and partition it the way I wanted, but after doing so, the hard drives work fine for day to day purposes (backup/transfer)."
4,Enclosure,"Used it to replace my 60gb HD on my PS3 with a 320gb WD HD. The only problem I encountered was when I connected it to my iMac keyboard using the USB cord. For whatever reason it would not recognize the 320gb drive. However, when I connected it directly to the back of my iMac it recognized it immediately. I formatted the 320GB HD and installed in my PS3. I'm now using the enclosure with the 60gb HD which have been working flawlessly."
1,Does NOT Support Drives Over 160 GB,"Easy to assemble, but does not support drives over 160 GB. So beware the recommendation from Amazon that others buy this device with WD 320 GB drives."
3,"works, but not great.","after my Laptop physically broke in half I decided to switch to a desktop for price and power reasons, the only way to retrieve data was to use an adapter because my laptop was completely broken. after about 5 minutes of fiddling I decided that the hard drive would never fit inside the case and so I am forced to use it just as a plug on the end of the hard drive, this might help with cooling issues but is definitely more susceptible to damage. if only the case was slightly wider or had square sides instead of round it would have been perfect."
2,Not that solid,"The item worked well, but from the picture it looks more robust than it actually is. The feel is to be very cheap, not great value for money."
4,HD Enclosure,"I needed this HD enclosure to upgrade the HDD in my MacBook. The enclosure is inexpensive, but does the job it is supposed to, without any problems."
3,Good but not as good as you expect,"If this hard drive works for a long time, it will become very hot. My computer is Lenovo Thinkpad. It's very quiet and cool before, I bought this hard drive to replace the original hard drive. When I changed, something are different. first, the reading and writing speed become faster. That's the good thing. On the other hand, my notebook become hotter and begins to generate more noise than before. So what you choose: speed or cooling down?"
4,Hard Drive Enclosure,Product came just as described. Fits well around my 2.5in formerly internal now external hard drive. Easy to use & included cords work great.
4,Great,"So far, this case seems to be working great. Shipped fast and was advertised correctly with all of it's hardware.."
2,There are better options,"Used it for 6+ months... It broke, the USB port on the circuit board.If you plan to plug/unplug the USB cable as with any other USB device you use... this can't handle that type of usage, it should be better welded, more solid. Same with the plastic... if you need to replace the enclosed drive a few times, it won't handle it that good."
1,Not Suited for 12mm Height Hard Drives,"I bought this for my Toshiba 12mm 500GB Hard Drive, but after getting the product realized that it only fits 9.7mm drives. Anyway i am using the adapter though without the casing, only after failing to jam my had drive into the aluminum casing (STUPIDITY)."
2,Doesn't like my Macbook Pro's USB ports,"After using it for a few hours, the drive icon disappeared from my desktop. After some testing, I found that my left-side USB port was not working for the drive or any other device. I moved the drive to my right-side USB port, and the same pattern occurred - the USB port ceased working. Reboot did not solve the issue. Running Apple Hardware Test showed no problems, but after running it, the ports began working again. I am now afraid to plug this directly into my computer again, and it needs more power than my USB hub can deliver - it's essentially of no use to me at this time."
1,Poor consruction-Does not fit some drives,"This enclosure does not fit some of the thicker 2.5 drives. You would have to force my WD 250gb drive into it. I was not willing to do that, so I cannot tell you wheter it would have worked or not."
1,"Flimsy quality, dead on arrival","I've had plenty of external USB hard drive enclosures and needed to cheaply pick up one more for a spare drive, so I figured this one would do the job as well as any. Not quite. I was a bit turned off by the loose feeling connection between the enclosure and my hard drive as well as the fact that the plastic was flaking off literally as I was putting it all together, but I wasn't expecting a top quality product for $17. I *was*, however, expecting it to at least work. I've tried this enclosure with both Windows XP and Linux, with one or both of the USB plugs on the Y-cable connected, every USB port on my computer, praying ... Besides the little green light on the enclosure lighting up, nothing else happens and the computer just doesn't see the new hardware at all. So right back to Amazon this enclosure goes."
2,little unfortunate,you cant just plug it in. the hard drive has to be formatted first (at least all the ones i tried) which means losing all the data on them. i found this very annoying which is why i dont really like this enclosure.
1,Did not work with PC or PS3,"I inserted a 2.5"" HDD into this enclosure, but it was not recognized at all by either my Dell PC or my PlayStation 3 after connecting the it with the USB cable. I then bought an enclosure made by a different company, inserted the same 2.5"" HDD, and it was promptly recognized by both the computer and the PS3. Clearly, the HDD was fine; the StarTech enclosure was the problem. This StarTech product was 100% useless and I threw it in the trash."
1,Did not work for my 7200 rpm drive,"Installation was easy, but tried twice to copy 8GB of files to the drive and it stopped both times after less than 1/3 of the data."
2,BEWARE OF THIS REMOTE!,"THIS REMOTE HAS POSSIBILITES, BUT IT IS FAR FROM USEFUL. THE COMPANY WHO MAKES IT SAYS THEY PROVIDE SUPPORT, BUT THEY DO NOT. I REPEAT THEY DO NOT. THE LAST TIME THEIR WEBSITE WAS UPDATED WAS EARLY LAST YEAR. THEIR WEBSITE AND ITS GUIDE CRASH FREQUENTLY. THEY DO NOT RESPOND TO EMAILS. WE BOUGHT OURS NEW AND IT HAS SOFTWARE PROBLEMS THAT THEY WILL NOT CORRECT. ALSO, THERE ARE NO BUTTONS FOR VCR AND DVD FUNCTIONS. YOU HAVE TO WADE VERY DEEP INTO MULTIPLE MENUS AND USE THE ON SCREEN DISPLAY TO PRESS PLAY AND FAST FWD ETC. ON YOUR DEVICES. ITS VERY DIFFICULT TO USE IN THAT MANNER. ALSO THE WAY TO UPDATE THE REMOTE IS WITH A SERIAL CABLE, SERIAL CABLES NEED SERIALS PORTS. SERIAL PORTS ARE SO OLD THAT A LOT OF PC'S DONT EVEN HAVE THEM ANYMORE. THIS COMPANY IS STILL SELLING REMOTES BUT NOT PROVIDING ANY UPDATES OR SUPPORT, BUYER BEWARE."
2,Because of Johnny,"Glad to finally get to watch this early film of Depps. He is excellent and even without the looks, his voice is one of a kind.It was escapism because the real world never really showed itself,like our own dreams.I won't buy this one or watch it again but watched it as part of Johnny's body of work."
5,its not on dvd in america,so buy it on vhs right now one of johnny depps best movies he has ever made.
2,Didn't get it,"I am not a movie lover but sometimes I enjoy watching something that is pure escapism. From the reviews I read, I was under the impression that this movie would provide such an experience. I was very disappointed. I don't understand psychological, philosophical, literary references. I am just to dumb. And, I am much to dumb to understand this movie. If you like a good story, its not for you. If you like movie's where things happen, its not for you. I was confused from the beginning to the end. There was not a single moment of coherency in the entire effort. But then again, I'm sure its because I'm just too dumb."
2,Great shipper / blah book,I am getting more and more skeptical about buying books online that I can't quickly thumb through before. This books title does not tell it all.
5,The Telsales Bible For Phone Reps,"WOW! Straight forward on what it takes to be a pro. After reading this, you'll wonder if you're in the right profession. No punches pulled here. He tells you things straight out such as you better have an educated sounding voice. People with heavy accents and don't have good diction will get killed. If you've never recorded your voice, you're losing money daily. He covers every single thing you'll ever encounter as a phone rep. He gives you exact phrases what to say, or you can tweak them to fit your particular situation. He shreds middle management in this, and tells you how to deal with these people once and for all. You're looking for a buyer today, not 6 months from now.A wicked little book, but very frank and honest. He also states that 80% of people selling by phone in America today, are not qualified to do the job. He gives you some good guidelines to follow when hiring people. Other then that, buy the book. You won't be disappointed."
5,A must buy for any Sales Team!,"""My sales team has found Joe Catal's information as an invaluable resource. The material is used as a reference for everything from objections to building urgency. Along with Art Sobczak's weekly 'TelE-Sales Hot Tips of the Week' newsletter, Joe's 'Telesales Tips from the Trenches' has been suggested to all of the Managers and Sales Representatives in ourorganization."""
2,A little rough -- for the boiler room sales person only,"Although SaleMan covers many of the basics, most of this is just script after script - many of which don't do it for me.This is for the turn and burn dial from the phone book tele-sales person rather than for the person that is trying to close active leads over the phone.This book really lost me when it stated that you should leave an ""incentive"" on the voice mail you leave including a product discount in order to get them to call you back. From my personal experience, ""discounts"" to generate interest almost never work -- discounts to close is more effective."
5,How To Make Serious Money,"This book isn't for people working out of a call center getting paid by the hour and following some script. This book's for the comissioned phone rep who wants to make serious money. These are high level selling techniques for people who are alerady pros, or wanting to obtain that level of expertise. You won't find any sugar coated sissy nonsense in this book. If you want to take your career to the next level, this book will help you get there. If you're just starting out in phone sales. When you're finished reading this book, you'll either become a pro, or decide to choose another field."
5,The book is a must have for telesales...,Pick up the book flip to any part and you will find something that you can use right away.
2,item is ok,"i bought this not to long ago, and now it seems to be turing off on its own, first time i bought a ""nitro"" not sure if ill get one in the future"
2,Mariah Is a Sweetheart But This Song Is Not,"I know Mariah aka ""MC"" and Jermaine Dupri aka ""JD"" are good friends, but they have NO CHEMISTRY! They just seem like what they really are: good friends with no attraction to each other whatsoever. Anyway, this song lacks everything a good song should have: good lyrics (OMG, the lyrics seem like they were written in 5 minutes), a catchy beat (the beat is annoying), and good vocals (Mariah seems hopelessly distracted while singing this). I'm disappointed."
5,SHE CAN'T STOP........ SHE'S AMERICA'S SWEETHEART!!!!!!!,"This song is so awesome, but J.D. takes away some of the song's glamor. Still, this disc is phat. Mariah's better by herself and you hafta pick up #1's if you like Sweetheart or her Fanstasy single. She's 'da bomb and this is a brand new Mariah from Vision of Love but I like it."
4,dis a tight @$$ song....the remix is even tighter....,"i luv mariah so much, and dis song is hella tight, i used to bump dis in my moms car, but the remix is even tighter, they play it on soul train, but i like the beat and the lyrics and its its a good R&B song......ya go gurllll....."
4,Great for everything from basketball to workouts.,"I have worn these shorts for years without issue or incident. I work out most days of the week, meaning running, weight lifting, and other sports. These keep me cool and dry, look pretty good and keep their shape, size and color after multiple washings. I'm about to order another pair!"
4,Champion Shorts,"I use these LaCrosse shorts as gym shorts. They are soft, comfortable, and good quality. My only complaint is that there is a sewn-in tag in the back that is rather annoying and scratchy, and it is impossible to remove without destroying them."
2,Quick Lookup Training Checklists,"None of the ideas in this book of checklists are bad, and some are quite good . . . but the volume as a whole lacks a key theme or common idea. I also prefer a more expository writing style; the endless checklist format gets tiresome after awhile - for me, anyway. I would look elsewhere for an introductory training book."
4,Badass,"This is a very good album. If you like hard, aggressive, and abrasive music you will like SJR. If not, I would reccommend you save your money. Superjoint is not for everyone (and that's cool) but if you dig Soilent Green and music like that you will like SJR."
5,If you don't own this...,"...buy it. This is, in my opinion, the best heavy metal record to come out in the last 5 years, maybe longer. It is THAT good. 'nuff said."
3,The demo is better than the actual album!,"Quick comments here: The SJR demo CD found its way into rotation in my stereo this week. I bought the ""real"" album a while ago, and it just appears to me that the demo actually sounds MUCH better. Its hard to believe that the guitar tone is better, the songs are better structured, and the vocals are more violent on the demo. Sure, the production is non-existant and the songs sound muddy, but underneath it all... They're all great songs (some I hadn't heard before), but one listen to the demo version of ""The Introvert"" will convert you. Do yourself a favor and find those, you'll see what SJR is really about."
1,Don't waste your time,"Superjoint Ritual to put it plainly is just not a good band. Every song on here is annoying except for one; The opening track in which Phil doesn't even sing on. Phils crappy vocals aren't even the main reason why this disc sucks either, some of the stupidest guitar riffs i've ever had the displeasure of hearing are on here. I never tried to compare this band to Phil's former groups, I took it for what it is. For those of you who are Pantera/Phil fans, give the group Down a listen, it is 1000 times better then this heap of trash."
2,good is small doses,"A friend gave me this CD...I listened to it a couple times, man this band sucks..No solos, not much thought, simplistic riffs, and nonstop screaming...Phil broke up Pantera over this garbage? F uck you Phil."
5,trasheverything,"This album has an awesome display of fast action drumming and thrash metal guitarz...phil anselmo's vocal rock, as in Pantera and Down.If you love thrash metal this album is must have."
5,"2 words ""STONER MUSIC""",Pantera's coolness + Down's lyrics + Eyehategod's music skills = SUPERJOINT RITUAL: use once and destroy. Enough said?
3,not very good,this cd is better than the second but it's still garbage. There are a few songs that are halfway decent that's why it got a three.
4,pull out your own tooth the morning after the mosh pit,"VERY agressive..brutal..do not insert earphones blasting at SjR into ear canal...will cause just as much damage as any DM or BM....but this cd really isn't DM or BM...it's PM for Phil Anselmo Metal, a unique metal genre to say the least. Buy this album if you're really into Pantera, Down, Slayer, or DM..stay away if you're new to the scene..."
2,This Joint Ritual is not very Super...,"First off, this album isn't the worst thing I've ever heard, but it's not all that good, either. Pretty much every song sounds the same - a bit like ""Animosity""-era C.O.C., but sans the musical talent of Mike Dean, Woody Weatherman & Reed Mullin.Case in point: Phil Anselmo. He should stick to vocals and leave the guitar to somebody else. Actually, the whole album kinda' sounds like it was written by a bunch of high school guys who really don't know how to play their instruments or write good songs yet. It just sounds really unoriginal and kind of... stupid.So, if you're a die-hard fan of Phil Anselmo's side-projects (regardless of quality), then go ahead and pick this one up. Otherwise, skip SJR and get both DOWN albums."
2,Should have expected this,"When you take Pantera's lead singer and put him into a another band what do you get? Another freakin Pantera. They sound just about the same, maybe a little simpler. They sound like that late eighties, early nineties metal. Band sounds decent, but the vocals just [stink]. His screams is just downright annoying. He never wants to change his tone. Always that high pitch screech, and then a death metal growl. I'm pretty disappointed in this album. I'm not a Pantera fan, but I guess I was just hoping for something that I knew in the back of my head wasn't there. Oh well, live and learn."
3,Gets old real quick,"Read the title of the review.Use once and destory is just heavy for the sake of being heavy. Most of the songs start with the drummer hitting the top hat a couple times, then bam! The sonic assault that is SJR begins. There are a couple of good songs (4 songs and a couple other i cant think of cause the cd isnt in front of me). But Not all of them are good.Think of it this way Its like a stripped down,faster and heavier version of pantera(comparision easily made because of phil's presence in both bands). No Solos(of any kind), just straight ahead extreme metal."
3,"Classic Gallagher, but not his best stuff","Gallagher is a funny guy, but his best stuff was not in this volume, and some of the material is now really dated. There are jokes that aren't funny any longer, because of legal or technological changes. This is not his best work. I have not seen Vol 2 yet, but hopefully there will be some sledge-o-matic in that one."
4,Here is Whats on This Disk.,Best of Gallagher: Volume 1 contains the classic cable specials Mad As Hell and Two Real.
4,Refreshing insight & real advice for a change,"This book has value because it's written by someone who has paid their dues in both the Vajrayana Buddhist practicioner world and the psychotherapist realm. The author gets real with the psychological pitfalls for Dharma students, as well as the inevitable problems with gurus/student relationships. He doesn't suffer the intellectually dry shortcomings of so many other western, Buddhist writers. You can tell that he has suffered, loved, been a serious renunciate, and father with kids, and had to work in the world; yet still maintains integrity and a strong impulse to liberation. I bought the book expecting little, but was delightfully suprised by his offering. I would strongly recommend that all sincere spiritual aspirants read this book, because some of the author's insights, warnings, and reflections are unique.....he says some things that are long overdue to be stated openly....an encouraging expression of the maturing psyche of western Buddhism."
2,Writing Style not Engaging,"To qualify my review, I must say that I put this book back on my bookshelf, having read only the first few pages. I found the author's writing style dry and academic. It seemed as though he was writing not with the reader in mind, but as though he had been assigned a topic on which to write...But it might appeal to you."
5,Tales from Africa,"Here are several dozen folktales from Africa. What's so nice about this book, is that it explores fairytales unknown to most Westerners. However, they are just as complex and as wonderous as those European fairytales we are familiar with. Paul Radin is an esteemed anthropologist, and he brings a scholar's touch to his collection. Highly recommended for anyone interested in folklore -- adults and kids alike."
3,"works, but very heavy","It does its job as it claims, but the two metal holders are so heavy. Despite it is a German brand, the sticker says made in China.I keep it because it is not worthy to send it back. In general, it works."
3,Works well but nothing special,"The product works well (i.e. it opens cans), but for the price I expected more effortless opening. Product appears to be well constructed."
1,Chinese Can Opener,Title says it all.....not a german or well made can opener....same chinese crap. Plastic handle...loose hinge....steel handle flexes... alright at half price (~$12) if you can get it. If you want to buy the last can opener you will have ever need....keep looking.
1,Two defective openers in a row?,"I first bought the OXO steel and later, the WMF openers on Amazon, before keeping two ""Smart Living"" openers from Giant Food Store. More expensive does not equate to a better product.I was surprised when both openers did not live up to the hype and had to be returned. The OXO opener did a very poor job opening a can and left jagged edges.The WMF had a very sharp burr on the bottom of one handle which had the potential to leave a nasty cut on the hand, had it not been seen before use. It also did not do a great job opening cans.The Smart Living openers have a nicely rounded rubber grip as well as a very nice ergonomic rubber twist grip to open the cans and feel great in the hand. The cut is sharp and precise. Costing just under $10, the Smart Living openers were a bargain."
5,The best!,"I love this can opener - it's so effortless, it's hard to believe. I was so used to lousy can openers that kept slipping off the can or getting stuck after opening it part way, then having to refasten and try to open the rest of the can - always a hassle. This one is an absolute gem."
5,Very good product!,"The best can opener I have used so far. It's larger than I thought but very easy to operate. I was hesitating before I purchased it because of its price. But after using it for a couple of time, I am so glad that I made the right decision. I think I won't need another one for years."
4,Not all Stainless,"Got this can opener about a month ago. So far very pleased with the ease it opens cans,much easier to turn than any opener that I ever had. Just for the fun of it I put a magnet to the cutter and gears and it stuck. which means the cutter blade and 2 gears are not stainless steel. Mine has not rusted yet but I'll now be watching very closely."
4,nothing like a quality utensil!,"I works as advertised! opens many different style of cans with ease, what more can one ask. sturdily constructed, it seems it will last a very, very long time. nice to look at. what's not to like? perhaps the stell finish tends to look spotty if you do not carefully wipe it down after cleaning but..overall highly, recommended."
3,"German steel held up well - plastic part, not so much","Purchased this in Nov 2009 after churning through countless barely-steel Chinese made can openers. This one is made from 18/10 German steel, although manufactured in China. The steel gearing did not slip at all, and the cutting mechanism never lost its edge, the two main problems we'd encountered with every chinese can opener to date. Unfortunately, the plastic spacer and crank mechanism just fell apart this week. It's never gone through the dishwasher, never been beat up, etc. The plastic portion just broke to pieces and then came off all together. So, back to the search for a can opener that can stand up to the ""mom's can opener that we had for 20 years"" we're all still looking for."
5,I thought I couldn't learn to dance...,"Our daughter was getting married and I was worried about the father-daughter dance. (I always thought that having two left feet would be an improvement for me.) Anyway, my wife suggested trying this video, and it actually worked! I learned how to do a foxtrot and not feel like a complete fool.I strongly recommend this tape for anyone who thinks they can't learn how to dance. The instructors have an encouraging, relaxed style, and the tape allows you to learn at your own pace."
4,nice and useful,This is a very useful text and reference book for electrical engineers and others who are interested. Its definitely meant for the graduate students and trained engineers and not for the beginners. I used this book as a graduate text and am immensely benefitted as I often require to revise many issues regarding my research. Provides many useful comparisons and references.
3,"Good book, but many errors","Agrawal is very well regarded in the field and in general the book is solid. I am using this book for a graduate level Optical Networks class. The major issue is that there are a lot of errors in the book, especially in the problems."
3,Fiber-optic communication sytems book's opinion,"This book is quite good book for professional and graduate students. However, might not be suitable for undergraduate students, as it is written in an encyclopedic manner."
1,Rape is not romantic!,"This Harlequin, by Yvonne Whittal, has to be one of the worst Harlequin romances I have ever come across. It isn't even worth discussing the plot, poorly contrived that it is, because twice in the book the so-called hero ""takes the heroine by force""(he even uses those words. They have kind of a marriage of convenience for the sake of her orphaned niece, but on the wedding night, Anton forces himself upon Laura. No reason, apparently other than it was ""his right"" or something. Later on, in jealousy, he does it again. Both times it is described in terms that sound like rape. There isn't anything romantic about sex that isn't consensual, it is rape and that's all it is. I'm glad this book is out of print. It should stay that way. The copy I got is going right into the trash where it belongs. I believe that I have read some Yvonne Whittal Harlequins in the past, that weren't like this one but I wouldn't buy any more of her books after reading this one."
3,Disibility means reliance on others,"Ten years ago since the American Disabilities Act went into effect, the disabled still feel that they are isolated from the real world. Former professor of anthropology at Columbia University Robert F. Murphy examines from his personal perspective the life of a disabled person in a world where he was independent and zealous of life. The reader will discover what it is like for a disabled person to battle besides the inability to carry out everyday function we take for granted. The Body Silent is unlike other books written by the disable. The Body Silent is an excellent book full of prose and not journal entries of how fortunate the non-disabled really are. This book (recommended to me by anthropologist Dr. James Trostle) will change your perspective and outlook on how it is like to grow up again and learning how to walk, one step at a time."
1,Paranoid claptrap,"Bent Corydon is just another in a line of people who can write a sentence and think that it makes them an authority. Dissing Hubbard and his many followers is a profitable enterprise, not unlike the news rags at the supermarket checkout stand which jump out with assertions of 2 headed coyotes and celebrity madness. I have been a Scientolofor several years, and the training and therapy that I have received from Mr. Hubbard has helped me triple my income. Not by ripping off unsuspecting seekers who are dragged into a Scientology church or mission, as Corydon might have you believe, but by making me more productive and efficient at my job (plumbing) and life. Don't listen to naysayers. Find out for yourself. Avail yourself of the free services offered by Scientology and Scientologists (we were quite present at the WTC aftermath, providing help and counsel to emergency workers and victims alike) and make the choice for yourself."
1,Oh Yeah?,"God gave us the 10 Commandments. Do you think we should consider them evil because of the Inquisition?God, Jesus, Mohammed, Buddha, Confucious, Aristotle and L.Ron Hubbard all have either given humanity damn interesting information or discovered aspects of the mechanics of improving spirituality.Should you throw away these things because the authors also had bad breath, farted or cussed once in a while?Do you believe in another individual saving your [self] or do you figure this [stuff]out with the info available and save your own [self]? Do not focus on the individual. Focus on his discoveries. What can you use of his work to improve your situation. You do have a situation don't you?"
1,"Ugh, what slander!","Having read this book when it first came out I was amazed at how shrill the author was, I kept an open mind but felt the ""feeling"" of the book was mean and not presented in a unbiased way. Some of the things in this book are just plain stupid, like the supposed fact that Hubbard smoked 5 packs of cigarettes a day. I don't think anyone on the planet can smoke 5 packs a day, much less burn them like incense all day and get anything done. Later I had the experience of being shown around a Scientology Mission and (keeping an open mind) found the people very friendly and the course I took to be extremely helpful in the recovery of a close friend of mine. Don't buy this book is my suggestion, it misses the mark."
5,Excellent! Fleeces your Scamgrams away pronto!,"Bent Corydon does an excellent job of revealing the utterly corrupt rottenness at the core and foundation of $cientology. Not that all members of this ""church"" are evil... Just their leaders! Followers are often guilty of no offense worse than gullibility- but the leaders of this ""church"", now they are something else! Read all about their roots in Satanism, documented here by Bent Corydon more shockingly than anywhere else. An excellent book! And oh by the way, for those of you who might wish to read a humorous spoof about the ""Church of Omnology"" which solves all your problems by ""fleecing your scamgrams away"", I might recommend ""Jurassic Horde Whisperer of Madness County"", for sale by Amazon.com... Beware of $$$$Scams!!!!!"
3,Mediocre but informative,"The writing style is amateurish. The narrative is difficult to follow. The storyline isn't very coherent. It's too bad, because there's a lot of good info about Scientology in it. I bought this book after working at a company run by (and with) Scientology. I was looking for some background on this looney cult. I think there are much better books on the subject."
1,Not serious,Author plays with fear and paranoia. Not serious. Fills the book with false evidences or partial facts. All tricks to sell more. What would you think of a book oriented in this way?
1,Read the book if you really want to get lost,"Scientology saved my life more than once and I have a healthybank account. How can it be? I use Scientology management andethics tools too... I plan my life. I don't buy a $5,000 package if I don't have the money.97% of the people are gaining from Scientology and it works for them. 3% don't. This book is about those 3%.So, in fact, this book tells the stories of loosers.It doesn't tell the stories of people who gained an enormousgain from it. Right?How many stories can you compile against Doctors, Psychologists,Teachers, Judges, Senators, Presidents that will make you tremble?"
1,Uhhh ......,"Pathetic.This book is a biased, almost 'unfair' portrayal of a certified religion. I would advise reading 'What is Scientology' or one of Hubbard's basic Scientology books before or after reading this one to truly understand Scientology. When you look at it fairly, Scientology actually isn't as bad as this book makes it out to be.What are the author's motives? The large majority of educated people who have viewed Scientology from an unbiased view point have found nothing wrong with it. I read this book, then questioning the author's obviously unscrupulous intentions researched Scientology for myself. The book is written like a madman's rant and appeals only to individuals who are either 1) gullible or 2)religious bigots."
1,Invalid Information,This book is completely biased. I have read many of Mr Hubbards works and found them of great value and help to my and my families lives. This book is a poorly written attack on a steller human being.
3,A step in the right direction,"While it is a critical and truthful book, a ""structure"" is missing, i.e. he just collected critical info and squeezed it into a book - I could get the same from the newsgroup alt.religion.scientology. I'd rather recommend to buy ""A piece of Blue Sky"" by Jon Atack, available here, which is much better researched, and has an index."
4,A True Expose of L. Ron Hubbard's Meglomania,"Not as good as Jon Atack's very fine work ""A Piece of Blue Sky"", but still filled with many first hand accounts of the man who created a world-wide cult of personality - Scientology. L. Ron Hubbard a science-fiction writer of the 30's and 40's turned cult hero and is still worshipped as a God in the Scientology cult he founded in the 50's. To understand why and the personality of the man who did this you need the kind of first hand accounts you will find here. Exposing the dark true nature of the man including incidents of drug and alcohol abuse, extreme paranoia, attempted manipulations of foreign governments, as well as abuse of children and adults alike, you won't find anything like it about a man who is as well known as Hubbard."
3,Find the 1996 edition,"I agree with many of the other reviewers here regarding the disorganized nature of this book. I just read a 1996 edition (hardcover) from the library - it has an added index and substantially revised sections (although it could still be severely edited). It also includes some info on Corydon's and other critics' recent legal struggles with the cult. Entertaining, but often confusing, and not well documented. The extended quotes from Ron Hubbard Jr. are particularly interesting."
5,Excellent Source of Information on L. Ron Hubbard,"Contains many stories from people who knew L. Ron Hubbard personally. Exposes the dark side of the man convicted of fraud in France in 1976 who was the head of the Scientology cult. Documents Hubbard's history of child abuse, drug abuse, psychiatric instability, meglomania, pathological lying, bigamy, fraud, and practice of ""Sex Magik"" as an admirer of Satanist Aleister Crowley. A MUST READ for anyone wanting to know the truth about L. Ron Hubbard and the true basis of his ""Church of Scientology"" which believes ones body is covered with the spirits of other beings."
4,"good, not very good","There are two problems with this book, even if you accept *all* of it to be true (and certainly most of it is). First, nothing cited within the book is annotated, so almost every claim made is unreliable. Second, there is no index, which is admittedly only an annoyance. Combine that with an unpolished style and haphazard organization and this book doesn't seem very formidable. Still, it has a few things you won't find elsewhere, and the author relates some of his own experiences as a Mission holder in $cientology, so is worth reading for those passages."
4,cool pack,I got this today along with a lot of others from toysrus. I like it a lot espically tarira this is very cool.
1,Whoo,Company is out of business and left previous owners hanging. Bias uses challenge and responce authorization and when they close down the web site you are SOOL.
3,Pretty Good,"This is a pretty decent soundtrack, worth checking out. Does anyone though know of any artist/composers that compare more to the slurry/dreamy single stringed tracks like Track 1. I'm looking for a CD that has mostly that style of song."
5,Amazing,"I cant really begin to describe how amazing this soundtrack is, and how well it fits with the movie."
4,Evocative music,"This soundtrack will appeal to people who love the movie Hero, or who is interested in traditional chinese music mixed with classical western sounds. One or two themes are picked up and reworked for other songs, so what you get from listening is a layering effect of repetition and reinterpretation. If you want a CD that has many different songs, then maybe this isn't for you. Personally, I think the soundtrack is gorgeous. Hearing a song like ""Hero Overture"" brings me back instantly to the world of the movie.Tan Dun also wrote the score to *Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon*, so it's interesting to compare the two soundtracks. Personally, I think the main tune in the Hero OST is more beautiful, but the variations upon themes in *Crouching Tiger*, more interesting."
2,Disappointing,"This book was a great disappointment. This book claims that it gives a sort of anthology of Lewis's works, with selections slightly longer than those from other anthologies (such as A Mind Awake or Words to Live By). Unfortunately, this book seems to be littered with excerpts that, to be fair, are indeed longer than most excerpts from other anthologies, but the selections lack the context necessary in order for the selection to be understood. This often leads the reader wondering what is meant by what he just read, hardly something desirable, especially given Lewis's extraordinary clarity on most occasions. This book represents Lewis in a bad light. A useful anthology is A Mind Awake. More useful, but also more expensive, is Words to Live By (both by Lewis). Save your money and put it to use on something you can enjoy and understand. Learn from my mistake.Daniel"
3,another entry,"See my review of this 1988 recording under the disc's other entry, where at the time of writing it is also cheaper:Piano Music by Del Tredici, Perle and Thorne"
3,Good for the money,"I bought this cause I have kept saying ""that would be a good t-shirt"" (inappropriate and vulgar phrases), and wanted to start creating my own. The program is really easy to use but the graphics that come with it are something that you would expect to see in a child's coloring book. You can post your own pics or drawings on the shirts which is a plus. Also I have noticed that black inked words tend to show up gray once you've ironed them on to the shirt with the provided paper. I will try a different brand and see if that paper works beter. All in all it was worth what I paid for. The Hane's website also has some professional heat presses that you can purchase if you get tierd of ironing stuff on by hand."
3,depends on expectation,"It is smaller than it looks....plates are too small to really have a big dinner, but if you are camping why the hell are you having a big dinner anyway????It isn't real strudy and if you use the fry pan, have plenty of oil or butter and a good scrubbie pad......Bottom line, you get what you pay for....take care of it, and you might even get a bit more than that....esp when the nice ones are like $50.00 more!!!!!"
2,Cute but flawed,"I give this a rating of 2 stars.It's pretty, it's not too flashy. BUT.. after cleaning it with hot water twice, the wire frame around the reservoir fell apart.All the positives don't mater if it falls apart and becomes unusable on the second cleaning!Okay: positives: the birds loved it, it was apparently easy to feed from. They managed to drain it within about 4 days, but as I say - I cleaned it well twice and it fell apart."
2,Dissapointing product,"At first glance, this item looked much nicer than most hummingbird feeders that we looked at. But, after receiving it and under closer inspection it is poorly constructed, it is crooked and it LEAKS! It was fairly expensive, and not a good deal."
3,no perch,"there is a place for perches, even the screw hole for them to be attached.My hummingbirds use the perch on the similar feeder I have, but won't come to this one. Pretty as it is, we will make our own perches."
1,Leaks all the sticky Hummingbird liquid out in half a day.,I got this for the good looks and now my porch floor is sticky. It's a bad design with a screw made out of plastic that easily breaks by the weight of the sauce you fill the feeder with. I got it because it looks great and different then all those plastic junkers hummingbird feedings. But...in the end it leaks and took a few months to start leaking so I can not return it. It took my hummingbirds a bit of time to realize the metal flowers were food holes but they did...and then it started leaking and drains out in an hour or so. so...to the plastic junkers...that will work and not leak! I got some birds to feed!!!
2,"General, Organic, and Biochemistry Student's Solutions Manual",This solution manual is basically identical to the information in the back of the main text. It offers very little additonal information. If this manual also offered even numbered solutions then it would have been a nice addition but that is not the case.
5,"A fabulous translation, fabulous poetry","I came to this book by way of reading Le Ton Beau de Marot by Douglass Hofstadter, and therefore I was expecting a sparkling and smooth translation of Pushkin. I was not disappointed in the least. The rhymes are wonderful and the syllable counts and meter are almost always perfect. I fully understand what Hofstadter meant when he said that after reading Falen's translation one gets the true sense of having read the original (this despite my not reading Russian). I recommend this heartily for anyone wanting to read this classic of Russian literature."
2,Eugene Onegin,Book arrived with crumpled front cover. It was not possible to tell if it was shipped this way or damaged in transit.
2,"Wrong qty, wrong size","Belt came in no package, and a quantity of only one. Installed REALLY tight. Look elsewhere for the correct product and quantity."
5,Perfect!,Nice item! Well constructed Case is a good fit for my Nikon Coolpix camera. Highly recommend. And Amazon is the place to purchase!
3,Inconsistent Sizing,"I purchased two pairs of these pants in small and the sizing is completely different. One pair fits well, the other swims on me. I really like the first pair, but I'm hesitant to buy more because I don't want the hassle of returning them if they don't fit."
2,Fabric Content,"Ordered these yoga pants because they were supposed to be over 95 percent cotton. Unfortunately they feel as if they are more than 5 percent synthetic stretch fabric. I can wear them for a short time, but I'm allergic to these pants and I couldn't find a label anywhere that SHOWED me the actual fabric content. I considered sending them back, but they're a perfect fit, look great and I can wear them for a short period of time. Since they weren't too expensive, I decided to keep them. I wouldn't buy them again."
4,Combine comfort and style,"These are not only extremely comfortable for fitness but quite stylish as well. They snug around my curves perfectly, it is just long enough to cover my feet and not touch the floor! I got a S (i'm 5'5, 120lb) The thin material is very light and allow maximum range of motion. I would probably stay away from light color tho since it may be slightly transparent. The only draw back is that they take a while to ship the item, but its definitely worth it."
2,Well they were okay,I got these in May and now it's January I think I started wearing them in October and they already have holes in the legs. I got an XL but I definitely could have gotten a smaller size. These things always fall down. I don't suggest buying them. They are comfortable just cheaply made.
2,Waist stretched out quickly,"These worked well the first couple of times I wore them, but unfortunately the waist stretched out. Now I am constantly pulling them up. I will be looking for a replacement."
1,shrunk on first wash,"I washed them on cold, and did not dry them. The pants are now a whole two sizes too small."
5,Love It,"I read all of these reviews prior to purchasing. There all all correct in their own way. Although the one customer was complaining about the pants being long - that was true for the pair I had recieved. That was great though! I am that 6 ft tall female. Okay, maybe only 5'8"" but I'm still all legs. And the sizes do run very small. I usually wear large yoga pants but the XL fits awesome. So be sure to order a size larger that usual and expect to have long pants."
2,Was my pair a freak pair or what?!,"I like the pants though as others have said they run a tad small. However, the sizing chart and description say they will have a 32-34 inch inseam, the pair I received has a 38"" inseam!! If I were a fashion model who was 6 feet tall I'd be thrilled! Well, I'm neither one. Sorry Christian, I'll have to return these!"
5,"Fast shipping, good product","First off, I was absolutely AMAZED at how fast these pants came! I received them in my mail box exactly 3 days after I ordered. I could not have asked for faster shipping!As for the pants, I would DEFINITELY recommend purchasing these in one size bigger then your normal size. I am a size M and ordered a size L and they fit perfectly around the hips/butt. They are a tad bit too long but it makes them look a tad bit more chic. The only downside is that they are extremely plain--all black and the band doesn't add much difference in appearance.Overall, these pants are comfy and perfect for lounging/working out! Would recommend them to anyone."
5,Love these pants!,"I just got these in the mail today, put them on, and wow! Love at first butt-hug. I have been looking for some spandex/yoga pants to wear with dresses, or whatever, and these are just perfect. Not too thin, very soft, and the fit is great. Also the top/waist area is very comfy, not restricting at all, and helps flatten your tummy area. I am a size 6 pants, and the Medium of these fits perfectly. They are kind of long, but I am only 5'4"", so that's probably why. I just bunch them up at the knee area a little bit to make them shorter, which is cute AND functional. Yay.If you're considering these pants, I would definitely recommend."
2,Not for people with long legs!,"I am thin and although I am not super tall, I have long legs and so I have a very hard time finding pants that are long enough for me, especially these type of pants that generally do not come in ""tall"" sizes. After reading other reviews where several people said these were too long for them, I decided to try them. They were about as long as capri pants!!! A good 6"" shorter than I needed. Other than that they fit well, and I'm sure for people who are regular sized they are great, but not for me. Beware if you need longer lengths!"
2,Thin material,"The fabric is quite lightweight, so be aware of that. The fit is perfect for a person with long slim legs. If you have more typical proportions you'll need to hem them and might find the fit through the thighs too snug."
2,"Super short inseam, defective pair?","I'm usually a XS in american apparel, so I was surprised--when I removed them from the packaging, I could instantly tell they were going to be short. I'm 5'6 and the inseam on these must have been around 28in. I tried to not roll the waistband, but then it just looked silly wearing it lower like that, it didn't fit. Will have to return, super disappointed. $20 wouldve been a steal for these."
4,These pants run very small!,"I ordered these in a Large and they look and feel like a Medium or even a Small. The material, cut, design and generous tummy coverage are all fantastic though! If I get another pair, I will order one size larger than usual.UPDATE: I had to return them."
4,Great Yoga Pants!,"I got a the black ones in Small. I am just under 5'7"" and 120 pounds and they fit well. Not too thin, not too thick and the color is a genuine deep black. I actually bought two more pairs after that - they are very comfortable and flattering. I just wish they were maybe an inch or two longer. They don't look like ""highwaters"" on me but they hit around my ankle. Not enough of a gripe to keep me from adoring these though...but if you are taller than 5'7"" or so you make wish to look elsewhere. Other than that I love these! Hold up well in the wash and look great on."
4,Not as long as I expected.,"I bought this pants hoping that there are really long and would fit good on me. I am 5'11"" & 140lbs. I am slim but my not model skinny. My legs have meat on them and they are not super long. I ordered size L following the advice in the other reviews, normally I wear M, sometimes S. This pants are not as long as I expected, they just long enough to cover my ankles like any average pants,so they are not super long. Sizewise they were fitting good in the very begging but after I wore them for a couple of days they really stretched and feels like real size L. Don't know what happens after washing them I hope they shrink but don't get shorter. The quality of this pants are really good though, they feel nice and soft."
5,Loved these.,"I absolutely loved these yoga pants. The fit was awesome. I wear a large (normal size) in these and they fit perfect. They lasted about a year, then they started to tear by the thighs, but that's continuous use (used for work after a few months) they seemed to be a boot cut fit also. Perfect for my uggs, sneakers, or flip flops. They aren't thin and exposing. GREAT BUY."
5,Perfect for Tall girls!,"I just ordered 2 pair in Black & Navy, and I am extremely happy with my purchase. I am 5'10 and have a hard time finding pants, coats, etc. to fit me the way I like but these yoga pants are great! Needless to say I wear them regularly and not just for yoga :-)Thanks Andrew Christian, you rock!"
2,see-through white pants are unwearable out of the house,"these pants looked cute in the photo, but when they arrived and I tried them on, I realized they were made of such thin material that they were see-through. if you buy them, DO buy a size up from your normal size and DON'T buy white."
3,Not worth returning but not my favorite yoga pants,I'm 5'5' and 126lbs and the mediums fit but I like the way other yoga pants fit better. I got better pants from Target a few years ago. The kind that make you look wow but the waistband on these is too big and they cling on your thighs too tightly. It's hard to explain but these just aren't that great in terms of fit.
4,adjust screw and paddle will not crack,The plastic attatchments will break if they hit/rub the bottom of the bowl. When you tilt the mixer back (referring to the K45) there is an adjustment screw. Loosen the screw about a half turn and your attatchments will not rub the bottom of the bowl and crack. The stuff was made to last and it will as long as you take care of it properly! I have a 40+ year old kitchenaid K45 that works just as well as it did 2 generations ago.
2,Disappointed too,"I must also add that I love my Kitchenaid, but my paddle attachment began to crack and peel also...not long after I received it. I was and am very disappointed, because I am afraid to use it, and that is really the best attachment for most of the things I make using my Mixer. I would like to get one of the all metal paddles, but cannot seem to find one for my mixer."
4,Fire circle chants,"Through a series of dazzling prose poems, Wittig tells the tale of a tribe of women warriors overthrowing patriarchy, and she challenges gender constructs through her language. It's a powerful and inspirational book about sex warfare, rather like ""The Handmaid's Tale"" or some songs by Tori Amos. A definite radical feminist classic worth reading and re-reading."
3,Groove Thang,"This album is likely to irritate the purists, so be forewarned (see below for some examples), but IMHO it's a pretty groovin' CD. Not all the tracks are keepers, thus three stars, but ""That Lady"" and ""Between the Sheets"" in particular are good updates to the classic Isley Bros. sound. Don't replace your copies of 3+3 with this, but this disc offers some good funky soul for your next groove thing."
1,Pretty Poor,"Now and days, since hardly any musicans have talent are remixes of greats being made. This cd was pretty poor. I am a huge fan of the (real pre R. Smelly) Isely Brothers. This cd left a very sour taste. I guess I was expecting something like Madlib or DJ Spinna & Bobbito on how they did there take on Stevie's old joints. This Cd is far from it. I only liked one song off of the whole cd, it was that Footsteps in the Darkness and I believe the only reason that I liked that song is because it was sort of similar to the original. If you are a fan of the Isley Brothers than I think that you should stay very far away from this cd. But if you are a fake hipster and this your first Isley Brother cd, than enjoy.P.S. Mos..... what the F*@k are you doing!?!? Stop messing around and put out another cd.One Love"
4,good book,Excellent ENT review for residents. Concise and easy to carry therefore easy to study any time you have a spare moment.
5,ENT Resident,"I found this book to be extremely helpful. It provides a well organized, readable format (unlike another popular review text). It is perfect for studying for inservice exams or boards. I recommend this book to every ENT resident or medical student interested in ENT."
3,"Concise, quick review","I use this book just prior to conference or the OR as a quick refresher for cases when I was a junior resident and also as a companion when studying for the yearly inservice. It is generally quick/concise text.I gave it 3 stars because the index is poorly organized. Unless you know the chapter where the information is located, you can be assured that you will not be able to find in a timely manner."
2,Go for the Chemerinsky Treatise instead,"Another reader suggests the Chemerinsky treatise rather than this book. I couldn't agree more. It's true, Con law doesn't lend itself to the E&E; format. You are much better off writing a kick-ass outline based on the Chemerinsky book. Be careful though, Erwin Chemerinsky has at least two Con Law books published by Aspen- one is a casebook called ""Constitutional Law"" (in red cloth binding) and the other is the hornbook called ""Constitutional Law: Principles and Policies"" in a black paperback. That's the one you want.Aside from this one bump, the E&E; series is excellent, and extremely useful for Civ Pro, Contracts, Torts, Property and Crim Pro. The older editions of Torts are missing product liability and even the new Civ Pro ones are missing class actions, so be aware of that."
2,Waste of Time and Especially Money,"This E & E is almost useless. It is useful only for a broad (read: extremely general) overview of the material in Con Law I. The examples are ok, but the answers are generally the author's opinions (as are many answers to questions in Con Law I). The book simply does not get to the heart of the topics covered (with the exception of the Dormant CC). You are much better off with Emmanual's--considered the best of the Con Law Commercial Outlines."
2,Buy something else,"I've been doing the E&E books in preparation for law school, and they've all been accessible and comprehensible. This one, however, is the exception. Maybe it's the ethereal nature of the subject, but this book is killing me. I feel like I am wasting my time reading it, since I can't seem to make out the forest, nor the trees, through the fog. If you're just starting out, I can't recommend this book for preparation. Maybe in the future it will make more sense, but for this beginner, it's very confusing."
4,A Ghostly Comeback,"Do you like scary stories? Then I would recommend Moonlight Man for you. Jenny Joslin, her dad, and her sister Ally have moved into a new house. Her neighbors are the Danners, the Burtons, and the crabby Carpeks. However, Jenny has been noticing weird things. She soon learns that the ghost of a man named David Tate is in the neighborhood. He wants revenge on the Carpeks, for what they did to him 50 years ago. Do you want to find out what happened? Then buy the book.By John"
1,The Moonlight Man,"I rate Moonlight Man a one because I don't think there was enough action in it.Also,I didn't like the setting.""I mean a house?Whats up with that""?The characters were ok. I didn't like April. She was very bossy. The rest of the characters were ok. This is why I rated the book 1 star.BY:AJC"
2,The Shadow,"This book is ok, but if you dont like ghosts like me you will defitenly not like this book!In this story Jenny(the main charecter) and allie (her little sister)are not happy because they keep moveing!Their dad acts like there is some thing bad about every single house they move in!Plus their mother died, and to make it worse all of their friends they ever had are back at their last apartment.and the worst thing is they are moveing into a huanted house with people next door who are crankey and old!"
3,Moonlight Man,The Scene Of The CresentI really liked this book. It did have some lame parts but the rest was great. I would highly recommend this book to kids who like ghost stories or want to be spooked. When Jenny and Allie Josiln move into the cresent (Cresent Lane)they see shadows of moving people.Just shadows. Doesn't that sound spooky? Want to find out more? Just get the book.By: Keely
3,The MoonLight Man,"Jenny Joslin a 15 year old girl,and her 7 year old sister Allie move into a new house with there dad,but they dont expect to live there long.They had moved 7 time since there mom passed away and now they finally found this little cabin in the woods that felt like home.Jenny and Allie soon find out that there house is somekind of haunted and so is her neighbors house,April.They try to figure out why there houses are haunted and why.Together they investigate stuff about the house and people who used to live there and all that good stuff.I think that this book is good for ages 7-13. Kids under 7 might not understand it and kids over 13 might think it was a little boring becuase it might not be scary at all.I liked this book becuase it had a little mystery in it and it was a little scary."
3,A Pleasant Read,"Fifteen year old Jenny Joslin and her six year old sister, Allie, have been on the move quite a bit: seven times in five and a half years. But no place has been quite as charming and yet as curious as their new house on the end of Crescent Lane. After all, in what other neighborhood, would a young man and his dog mysteriously appear and disappear. And in what other neighborhood would you discover that odd things are happening not only at your house but your neighbors' houses as well. Finding clues to these disturbances leads Jenny not only to the discovery of a fifty year old secret, but also what it means to be truly part of a neighborhood. The Moonlight Man is a nice read that might give a goosebump or two...Crazy James"
4,The Bookwatch,"To Know God by Michael Gemignani (rector of St. Paul's Episcopal Church, Freeport, Texas) offers twelve flexible, insightful group sessions to help individuals understand and embrace spiritual direction in their lives. Sessions explore such topics as the nature of sin, opening one's mind to God through meditation, the true meaning of the crucifixtion, and much more. To Know God is very highly recommended not just for spiritual discussion groups, but also for anyone ready to do some deep thinking to better understand their relationship with God.-reviewed by The BookWatch, March 2002"
3,Blaze of Glory,"From day one I have been blown away by the Nanosat Mirage system. I am running a 7.1 system with this 8"" sub. I was shocked by how clean and pure this sub drives. I didn't expect much from only 8"", but somehow the Mirage delivered better-than-theater quality sound with hard-hitting bass and an obvious rush of air from the sub. I was the envy of all my friends! You'll notice I said ""delivered."" That past-tense was intentional because after just over a year of wonderful service, my sub blew, now putting out only barely audible sound. The 7.0 system is nowhere near as enjoyable as the 7.1 was! Unfortunately, the warranty expired at a year, so I am out a sub or a few hunderd dollars to buy another. I am reluctant to spend that much money on a sub that only lasts a year. However, it was a great year with a wonderful system!"
3,Not as good as it should be,"It's not really bad, but it's nowhere near as good as one would hope or even expect with that price tag. This book is more for novices, whom I can't imagine would shell out fifty bucks for it. Those already familar with Italian horror will learn nothing new here. To make matters worst, the book is full of errors, some that even the most casual reader are likely to know to be wrong. Two examples being misidentifing one of the characters that Anna Falchi plays in Dellamorte, Dellamore (Cemetary Man)and the idenity of Asai Argento's mother. All this plus unwaranted critisim of the films themselves. At twenty bucks, it would be worth adding to any serious collection of books relating to horror films or films in general, at fifty bucks, If I could do it over again, I'd pass"
3,An okay zester,"This is awkward to use as it is sooo small. Also it produces strips instead of zest. Great if you want decorative strips of lemon in your recipes.If you want regular zest in your recipes, I suggest getting a microplane zester."
4,works well,I used this when making lemon icing for cupcakes. You gotta use short strokes if you want tiny pieces (or just chop them quickly after). But I used it to make long stripes to garnish the top of the cupcakes and it looked really cute. Easy to clean which is a plus.
1,Cheaply made and does not work at all.,The blade is so dull I practically bruised an orange trying to zest it. The neck of the blade bends at the handle when you apply pressure to the blade. I was able to (sort of) zest 4 lemons and then the blade started bending like a rubber band. Made a mess of my hands and my counter. I would rather zest with a cheese grater.
2,Not a Tour Guide,"If you want a brief but good description of these old boom towns and ghost towns, this book does an okay job. If you are looking for a tour guide look somewhere else. The writer should provide better information about what you will find at these sites if you can even find them. We recently took a trip to some of the places found in the book and found the whole trip frustrating. The town of ""Old Molson"" looked more like a reconstructed museum site instead of the original site. Interesting buildings though. Many of these places are either on private property or off limits land if you are thinking of metal detecting or relic hunting. Some were just little towns that have an interesting past and a few little sites and tourist traps. Many places were also just too difficult to locate."
3,Has good information,"This slender book has a good deal of information. However, it is somewhat helpful in locating ghost towns."
2,Not worth it,"This product was accidently sent to my parents home, so I told them to watch it before they forwarded it on to me. They never did, and boy am I glad they didn't. This video has a five minute cheesy preview for another movie, and in their preview lots of nudity is shown. My parents would NOT have been amused. It was so bad I thought that I might have gotten a mis-labeled DVD. But not, the John Cleese part eventually showed up.John Cleese's standard humor you have known from his movies is lacking, the party at his house looks totally scripted, the interviews are stiff and do not flow, etc. Anyone want to buy my copy...?"
2,John Cleese - Wine for the Confused,I ordered this because I'm a huge John Cleese fan (Fawlty Towers is the best sit-com ever!) and I'm a wine fan as well. It was just toooo basic for me or anyone who knows anything about wine - and who else would buy it???
4,Nice To Be Reminded of the Basics,"I watched this short film with my wife and we are definitely not wine-confused. It is our drink of choice, and we try to learn as much as we can about it, and we try to visit wineries in all our travels. Having said that, this little film was great.We enjoyed John Cleese's dry humor and fun-way of explaining the basics. He does pick three red and three white varieties to discuss in detail. These varieties are geared towards the American market, as this is clearly the target audience.We also enjoyed the little blind test experiments.Overall, very entertaining whether you are confused or not. Grab a glass and enjoy!"
5,This DVD is a hoot!,"I bought 4 of these for friends and the local library. It is the best down to earth wine information ever recorded. Trust me, I drink a lot of wine."
3,Still a bit confused,If your experience with wine is such that you can tell the difference between a red and a white wine then this DVD will be quite useful. If you are beyond that level then it may still provide some useful insights but you may not feel that it was worth the expense.
3,"I like Wine, and I like Cleese, but...","I like Wine, and I like Cleese, but I did not like this DVD. In fact, I would say it was boring. There was really very little content and I was hoping Cleese to be a bit more amusing.It would not be suggested to buy this DVD is (1) you want to learn about wine, or (2) you want to be entertained.""Wine & Cleese"" sounds a lot like ""Wine and Cheese"" -- never put that together before!"
2,Disappointing,"The John Cleese name made me think this would be witty and informative. It was neither. He does make one good point - that people often are intimidated into feeling they ""should"" like something expensive, which needn't be the case. If you need convincing on that point then buy & watch, otherwise save your money."
5,one to get,Well when i got the book i was amazed on the amount of diffrent Roof Framing situations that are in it . Stuff in this book not to many people know how to do. Even if i just use the book once to refer to the 20 i spent on it was worth it ... If you are Into cutting rafters and find the Common Gables and Hips fun to do then you would love this ....
1,not worth spending the money,"I bought this and it worked for about a week, now it does not charge at all. Don't buy this"
1,Rubbish,"These will cease to hold their charge after a while, rendering them into an oversized poor-substitute nightlight and nothing else. As an emergency flashlight they are worthless."
1,Non-functional junk,"I bought this light a few months ago and was immediately annoyed by the design which blocks the other outlet and prevents you from plugging in anything else in a normal receptacle. When the power went out for the first time recently, the battery was dead and the light did not work."
1,Sylvania 72032 battery failure,"Purchased six of these for one of my homes in the forest. I was just relaxing in a hot tub reading when I heard a audible popping sound, quite loud, I was very surprised. Whatever storage device they use for the battery had over charged and had popped. This concerns me, if I am not here what could happen to my home due to the faulty device. I jumped up to see what the sound came from and could hear the chemical reaction to the overcharging, it was a sizzling/crackling noise coming straight from the nightlight. They are about six months old and will be returned asap."
2,Emphasis on Failure,"Bought this little light at our local home improvement store a year or so ago and it wasn't cheap. Bought just one at the time to try it out with the idea of going back for more depending on how well it worked. It lasted about a year before the manual flashlight portion failed. It only works as a nightlight now which is not what we needed it for. It uses LED's so I don't imagine they went dead. I am guessing it is the internal battery that you can not get to or replace. An improvement I would make, load it with common NiMH AA's so they can be replaced as needed. This little light will probably end up in the trash soon."
1,no longer holds charge - don't waste your $,"These worked wonders when new, but after a few months, they go from going dim to no longer holding any charge at all.I've emailed Sylvania, awaiting a response - otherwise, waste of money and I have to buy replacements from a competitor."
1,Goes dead very soon,"I bight four of these from amazon. Three worked for two months, plugged in; one of them worked only only for three days."
2,Temperamental; not much life to 'em...,"We bought four. After a year one still works, one had to be returned, because it did not work at all, one did not work in our last power outtage, and the other just works as a night light now -- that's it in a nutshell."
1,Does not last,I bought three of these on April 25 2010. Only one of them still works when the power fails. I would not recommend these. The amount of light they put off is good. My complaint not even one year later two of them only work while plugged in.
1,Too bright,"Sylvania 3 in 1 LED Light, Nightlight, Rechargeable Flashlight, Power Failure Back-up LightImpractical because the ""nightlight"" is much too bright, lighting up a whole room, and if you put it out of sight not enough light reaches the sensor to ever shut if off. The only way I could use it was to tape over most of the ""nightlight"" section and tuck it away so that it had to be manually switch on and off every night and morning. Stopped bothering."
3,Rechargeable Light,"The product is cute but the power input is 140volts in my country it's generally 240v, so one needs to purchase a step down."
1,Piece of S***,One of the worst if not THE worst products I have ever purchased. Bought about 8 of these about 5 years ago. Always plugged in and during Hurricane Sandy was first big test. More than half did not function as Emergency Lighting (dead batteries). HUGE disappointment! Stay FAR FAR away & do not even consider purchase!!!
1,Piece of junk,I have two of these - they worked until an extended power outage of 9 days. Afterward they will not recharge and are useless for the purpose needed -> emergency lighting when the power fails. It could have been a great product if the battery was replaceable or the company invested a few more pennies to put a better battery in them. You are buying a $10 nightlight that will eventually only work if there is power. Spend your money elsewhere.
1,Not a good choice,"We were given several of these Sylvania emergency lights and like many of the other comments here, the battery fails and the unit does not come on when the electricity goes out. For some reason, our electricity goes out often, even in the middle of a nice sunny day, so we were happy to get these units so we could see to walk through the house when power goes out at night.There are several other brands that make this type unit and we are going to read reviews and try a different brand."
2,Eh.,"I've got several of these, and I'm unimpressed overall. It throws off very little light as a nightlight, and doesn't do much better as a flashlight.If your eyes are already dark-adapted, it might be barely adequate, but it has the advantage of being inexpensive.An emergency flashlight (Energizer Item model number: 30039800023460-P) saved our lives when our house burned down at 1:30 in the morning in the middle of Hurricane Ike. I now have about a dozen of various types of emergency flashlights/nightlights scattered around the house.I recommend getting something bright and highly rated, at least for hallways and stairs.Once burned, twice shy."
3,Flashlight lasts about 3 hrs versus advertised 7 hrs ...,"These are good as nightlights, but as for the flashlight which is supposed to last for 7 hrs per box label, nope.My kid charged the unit about 24 hrs then unplugged it and used it as a nightlight (on top of the TV) so we can test how long the charge really lasts. It was bright at the start, but after 3hrs, the light was really dim already.BTW, this was purchased at Sam's Club for around $17 including tax."
4,"Works well, could be improved","This light works well but I would like it better if it didn't block both outlets. The automatic night light and power outage features work well. The flashlight is bright but is really more of a flood light, the beam doesn't go very far."
1,"A 2-in-1, not a 3-in-1","I purchased two of these. Both worked fine as an emergency power failure light and night light. After a few weeks the flashlight function on both failed to work. So, it's a two-in-one, not a three-in-one, as it's advertised. I would probably not have purchased it without the flashlight function, so I am disappointed with the quality and cannot recommend this."
3,"Pretty good, for as long as they actually worked (revised)","I bought three of these last year, because we have frequent power failures in this area. These were very handy for first couple of five minute power failures. After that, the batteries in all three units died, and the flashlights no longer work.They still function as nightlights, of course, but I've got my old nightlights that don't cover two outlets (and that didn't cost anywhere near what these cost.) Save your money--don't buy these. Shame on you, Sylvania.Update: I got angry enough to track down Sylvania's website and then their phone number, and I called to complain. They're replacing all three lights, under warranty. I did notice that the website describes these as ""1st generation power failure lights,"" and there is a second generation, an entirely different model.Revised to three stars because Sylvania does support their products. I'll update this review after I've had the new lights for a few months."
1,don't waste your money,"Bought a 3 pack of these... what a waste of money! They make a nice nightlight, and the FIRST time the power goes out they do a good jobs as emergency lights. BUT It is one time thing for the emergency light and flash light because either the unit does not recharge the battery or the batteries are bad and will not recharge. Same problem with all three! So save your money and buy some cheap night-lights and a good flashlight."
1,DREADFUL. Sent them both back.,"These are dreadful. Read and heed the many negative reviews. They cover both outlets (duh)!I ordered two and have returned them both. One didn't work as a standby light at all.They both had rotary switches that were so tight a pair of pliers was required to move them.Amazon should really stop selling these.And if there is anyone still alive at Sylvania that remembers what quality products were once sold under that brand name, they would be ashamed of this one."
2,2 for 1 price and one failed in only 3 months,"I got these from local supermarket at buy 1 get 1 free deal, after only 3 months, when the power failed in our community, I found out one of them already failed. It still work as a night light when plug in wall outlet but the battery do not store charge at all. I pull it out from the wall socket and the light will not even last 2 seconds. If you buy multiple of these like me, hopefully you still have at least one working unit when power fail. But if you only have one unit, good luck with that."
1,CAVEAT EMPTOR!,"This product is great in idea, but Sylvania created a piece of junk, here. I purchased three of these lights. Within 45-60 days, they would not function as a flashlight, as they should, when detached from the electrical outlet. Furthermore, in case of power failure, they also do not come on, utilizing their built-in, rechargeable batteries, as they should. Now, these are nothing more than expensive night-lights; each of the three I purchased broke. I will not be purchasing much else from Sylvania, if this is the type of quality they let escape their manufacturing plants."
1,Quits working after about 3 months,"At first these lights worked great. It was very handy as a quick flashlight where I didn't have to worry about the batteries being dead as with standard flashlights. The one time we lost power it was great to see these all lit up around the house. But now we've had 3 out of 5 units quit working - they no longer hold a charge. They'll function as a nightlight, but if the power goes out or they're unplugged from the wall, they don't function. They end up being expensive nightlights. I cannot recommend them - spend your money on another brand."
2,Does Not Last,Don't waste your money. These lights are alright (not great) when new and gradually loose their ability to hold a charge in about a year. Unless you test them frequently you will find out during a power outage that they are dead. Even when they were new the light was not all that bright and the battery did not last very long before needing a recharge.
3,I prefer another product,"You really should by a power failure light - but I prefer Eco-i-lite. I have this Sylvania, and it is OK, but I find I prefer Eco-i-lite. Reason: (1) ecoilite is easy to use as a hand held flashlight because it's inductively chrged (2) its battery is Lithium, so it should last longer. Also I found this Sylvania is not sensitive enough - when I turn on the hall light, it still stays on. Other night-lights shut off. Eco-i-lite does."
1,2 out of 3 ain't bad - or is it?,"I bought these units as a 3 pack and I find that 2 of the 3 units still function after less than a year. It would seem to me a unit designed to be a failsafe power failure device should be capable of being plugged in, left alone, and available when needed, which should be infrequently.The unit probably suffers from inferior quality cells and should probably be cycled on and off on a regular basis. They last just long enough to satisfy the warranty period.I noticed other people mentioned when this unit is plugged in to a normal duplex outlet, the other plug becomes unusable which is absolutely true."
1,DO NOT BUY. SAFTEY HAZARD,After buying these in a three pack from BJs a few months ago two do not work. They did not just stop working. The battery blew up inside. A few weeks ago a family member was upstairs and heard a loud bang. After a lot of searching of what could have made the noise we figured it was this light. It did not work anymore and when it was shook you could hear something moving inside. A few weeks later I was sitting at my computer and heard a loud bang from the direction of another one near me. I unplugged the light and could hear a fizzing sound. I unplugged the third one and put them both in the outside trash. Do not buy these for your own safety. I don't think the explosion of the battery inside could cause a fire. But don't risk it. If you reading this you can already see that too many people have issues with them. I will be writing to Sylvania. They should stop selling these.
2,not worth the money,I purchased 3 of these to use in case of a power failure. I plugged them in per instructions. Had a power failure and none of them worked. Have gone back to having flashlights placed around the house so I can grab one in case the lights go out again. This product is not worth the time or money.
1,I got a lemon!,"I don't know why we didn't return this, because after it's been plugged in overnight it only was good for a night light. The flashlight has never worked. So after reading the other reviews I feel I have a lemon."
3,Works but blocks both outlets,"While it works as claimed, though I've not tested how long it will stay on during a power outage yet, it covers both outlets. The plug should be at the bottom, not the middle."
4,Bright nightlight,The nightlight is very bright and the time it comes on is good with the sensitivity to light. The flashlight is very bright too. The only bad feature is it blocks both plugs.
4,Good back-up light,"I have four of these and I use them on my house. The flashlight is of a useful brightness and the emergency light aspect is excellent on a region where power sometimes goes out at night.The plug is not polarized, so you can point the night light portion up or down, and I do both. The plug position is such that the light covers both power outlets if you have an inline 2 power outlets faceplate, thus rendering the other power outlet useless. This is the only reason I did not give a 5-star review."
1,Absolute Junk!,"Five months ago, I purchased ten of these to make traveling through the house safer during a power outage. After a few months, three stopped working. I returned them and received three more. As of this date, out of the ten, only one continues to work, and it is ready to go at any time. I have found, over the last several years, that Sylvania products have become extremely inferior to other products, most especially their light bulbs.Previously, while out of the room, one of Sylvania's regular 60-watt light bulbs, which was in a fixture above my dining room table, burst. This caused one piece of the element to fall into a solid oak dining chair. It burned a 1/2 inch long by 1/16 inch deep hole in the chair. I shudder to think what could have happened if the piece had fallen on a place mat or if there had been cushions in the chair.I will most definitely never purchase or recommend any Sylvania product!"
1,Do Not waste your money!,"I purchased two of these night lights to keep in the entry way of my home...Yes, they still work if they are plugged into the electrical socket and it gets dark and there ispower.But, the emergency flashlight feature lasted so few months it is hardly worth mentioning the feature.I would not purchase again."
1,Don't buy!,"The idea is great but this is worthless, the ""battery"" (I took it apart and it's a sort of capacitor not a battery you can replace) stopped charging after three months making this thing worthless."
1,DEFECTIVE DESIGN - DO NOT BUY !!!,"We have four of these lights, and after 6 months ALL of them lost their battery-backup capabilities as others have posted. I contacted Sylvania and they wont return calls -- thjis is clearly a defective design as the batteries loose their ability to charge after only a few months!"
2,This is not the light you want,"We bought several for regular power failures. The night light/emergency light combo used to be hard to find. Found out the hard way these lights are way too sensitive to lightning strikes. We have one left that we use in hotels just in case. And why put out a light that covers up both outlets?Here's a better answer- GREENLITE.It's a night light, flashlight, power failure light and it laughs at lightning strikes. Tough as nails and it leaves the second outlet open."
1,Not as advertised,I received my light right before a storm where we lost power. Whole apartment was pitch dark and this light didn't light up even though it had been charged for two days. What a waste of money.
2,Wouldn't recommend it,"It's better than nothing, but there are other items on the market that, in my opinion, are better designed. The Greenlight LED 3 in 1 offers 8 hours of post-power illumination to this one's 3, doesn't monopolize the outlet, and is 5 bucks cheaper."
1,No quality,"We ordered a total of 16 units and within six months eight of them had ceased to function at all, three would only work when plugged in (the rechargeable batteries ceased to hold charge) and the others were returned new. A 50% + failure rate is a real quality issue. DO NOT purchase, as they will certainly become non operational before a year is up!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Cannot replace the Battery ( Do Not Buy This),I purchased several of Sylvania's night lights and thought they were great until the batteries became weak and died. I found it almost impossible to disasemble the light but I finnally broke it to see where the batteries were. The one battery is soldered in place but it is not made to replace the battery. It is nice but it will not last long if you can't change the rechargable battery. This is wrong.
3,Some possible quality control issues,"I purchased 3 of these and 1 has failed as a night light but the flashlight still works. The 3 LED flashlight is quite bright and useful so I'm keeping the failed unit for the flashlight. The light blocks the other plug which is a minor annoyance and the LED night light is overly bright for my taste when it works. A worthy concept however at a reasonable price. I might try the Sentina Emergency Smart Light available at Amazon since the flashlight claims to work longer, 8 hours versus 3 for this one."
3,"Great nightlight, terrible flashlight!","Bought a 6-pack of these from Sam's to try them out. Hogging the plug is a problem, but one I can live with. The think that irks me about these, is that of the 6, only one still works as a flashlight. They all work as nightlights, but as soon as they're pulled from the wall, two die completely, three have severely reduced light, only one still works as advertised. All units have less then 30 hours use as flashlights. Units are kept in the socket (per instructions) and have never been allowed to completely discharge."
2,Power failure mode failed after 6 months,"We bought one of these 6 months ago and have had it plugged into an outlet in a hallway, where it's a great little nightlight. However, the power failure mode on it no longer works- when it's unplugged, the flashlight part will not turn on. There's no problem with the light itself, as you can plug it into the wall, turn the switch to ""on"" and have the flashlight part come right on. I suppose it's just a really bad battery or something that died after a few months.We are still using it for a hallway light, since in light sensing mode it works very well. However, we'll be looking for a new kind of power failure flashlight."
1,Totally useless,"Within two weeks the batteries in this ""new"" light were DEAD. The nite-lite came on when plugged into AC, but as soon as the power went off or you unplugged it - NO light!"
2,Deceptive packaging,"I bought one of these from a big box store where it was nicely packaged so that I could not examine it. Pictures on the package showed it in various uses including being plugged into a wall receptacle where it illustrated that, when in the upper socket, it cleared the bottom socket by a wide margin. Well, you can guess what reality was. No way could the bottom electrical socket be used without unplugging the light. As for performance, I can only tell you that the upper part of the light, used as a nitelite, was very bright, but my experience with LED nitelites is that they dim severely over a period of 12 months."
1,Battery has very short life,"I bought two of these about a year ago. They work well as a nightlight, but a recent powerfailure showed that the battery is poor. They no longer held a charge and failed as a power-failure emergency flashlight. What's worse, is that unless you test them regularly, you would not know how short the battery life is. I have a older product which is years old, and still performs it's function when the power goes out..."
4,"Not one of Mo's best, but still a must-have","Mo Willems is very popular in our home. Our six year old adores the pigeon books. We have read them all, and own most of them. ""Don't let the Pigoen Stay Up Late"" is the weakest book in the series, but is still adorable and we had to buy it. ""The Pigeon Finds a Hot Dog"" is still the favorite in our household, however. The pigeon books are excellent to read to toddlers and excellent for early readers to read out loud for themselves."
4,We love the pigeon!,"This is the third pigeon book by Mo Willems we've purchased, and we were not disappointed. My daughter who just turned six can really identify with the cunning pigeon's excuses for staying up late. And now, thanks to the pigeon, she has a new one: ""It's the middle of the day in China."" She also giggles everytime at the simple but hilarious and extremely expressive illustrations."
3,Cute idea but kids aren't interested.,I think the humor is above the level that the book targets. It ready funny for an adult but my daughters don't like it much.
4,Is the Pigeon my two year old son?,Mo Willems has a keen sense of the antics of children as they try desperately to hang on to every second of the day before they go to sleep. Poor pigeon tries every trick in the book to stay up for just another few minutes before falling helplessly into dreamland. A funny insightful book. Love it.
5,We could count the stars!,My 2 year old absolutely loves this book. She can read about 6 pages in it. She laughs so much throughout the book. This book is perfect for little ones as it teaches them that everyone...even a pigeon must sleep.
4,no never sounded so sweet,my toddler loves this book. makes him feel like he can read just like his big sister. a great way to release energy before going to bed. i recommend this entire series.
5,Best book ever...,This book is terrific. So funny and so engaging. I love it as an adult and as a mom and my son is totally in love with it. Mo Willems - we adore you!
5,Another great book by Mo Willems,What's not to love about our friend the Pigeon? This cute tale about wanting to stay up late resonated with my kids (7 and 5 yrs) immediately. What child doesn't beg for a few more minutes of stay-up late time?
3,great series need more literature,This series is great and entertaining would have giving 5 stars if not for the lack of literature. Stories should have a strong beginning and end.
3,Mo Ideas needed,"Now, don't get me wrong Mo's a cool hip happenin' cartoonist, but this Pigeon idea has run its course.The first Book was funny, the second was cute, but this one was more of the same.It was graphically more sophisticated, and written well. But it's the third in a series which needs a rest.I cacked out LOUD with the first book due to its spontaneity, but in these sequels you expect it.All I want now from this saga is a t-shirt and I'll be happy.Only buy it to complete your collection."
1,It seems I disagree with nearly everyone else,"I bought this book for my son who is 4.5, based on the overwhelmingly positive reviews, but unfortuneately it is just not for us. My son is now enjoying books with a ""proper"" story that we can talk about, and this book doesn't provide either. He just look bemused whilst I was reading it and at the end said he didn't like it. If you are looking for some great books for 4 / 5 year olds try: Six Dinner Sid, Dogger, Dinosaur Dig."
1,don't let the author...,"Don't let the author write another pigeon book. no MO please!My son told me, ""Daddy, pigeons don't have long necks."" he's right."
5,This guy knows toddlers,The words in this book could have come out of the mouths of anyone's toddler. The illustration is simple yet supports the text perfectly. Enjoyable for kids and parents. A real gem.
5,Dont let the pigeon stay up,Dont let the Pigeon stay up Late is by Mo Willems it is a funny book about a pigeon that wants to stay up past its bed time. The setting is at the pigeons house my faviort part of the story is when the pigeon gets on his knes and begs to stay up he says pleasssssssssssssssss just five more minets pleas but the owner says no.This book is a great book because it will make you laugh.by Mia in mr. Ewing's class
5,All the excuses kids can think of...,"Mo Williems catches all the excuses kids can think of to avoid sleep. My 3 year old daughters typical excuses are 'I need a glass of water', 'I'm not sleepy at ALL' rubbing her eyes, even 'I have to clean the house'(taking a hint from my wife who has a habit of cleaning while I put the kids to bed.)This book is hilarious because you can totally relate. I love how with each turning of the page, the background gets darker and darker. I love his Pigeon series but I have to say that this is my favorite."
5,A Perfect Treat for Grandchildren,The Pigeon series is a great treat and joy for young children. My Granddaughters act out the part of the the little pigeon and have great fun being this chacter.
5,Use this book to deal with bedtime struggles,"Children recognize themselves when they read about the pidgeon who uses many delay tactics at bedtime. Children think it is funny, and adults will appreciate the help in getting their children off to bed."
4,Young child book,These books are great for reading along with young children. Big pictures and great simple story lines make it easy for the little kids to fallow and enjoy.
5,Such a great book!,"We adore the pigeon books!!! If you're looking for a book to help encourage the love of reading, this is definitely a good series! Pigeon is sooo funny! We started with the pigeon board books, and there has yet to be a pigeon book we haven't liked! This one is hilarious as well!"
4,good bet,"This book presents 15 stories of gay intrigue. Throughout, the author kept me interested in the characters and working hard to gather clues to solve each mystery. I especially enjoyed the variety of story types and the diverse mix of characters. I also liked the breezy and engaging style of writing. At 15 stories, the book is a little short, though. I wish he had included a few more. I read the reviews just before I entered this one and I was surprised by one reviewer's comments about tons of typos. I didn't find that at all. There were a few, which is what I often find in books, but nothing major. I don't know what that reviewer's agenda was. Anyway, the writing in the book is solid and the mysteries are definitely a challenge. If you like to solve gay mysteries, this is a good bet."
1,HE REALLY ANNOYS ME.,Fat joe is a talentless loser who needs to lose some serious weight.This album is stupid and boring.All the beats sound the same and his rap style is crap.You will find many copies of this cd in the used section of any record store.DO NOT SUPPORT THIS CRAP!!!
4,"If you can appreciate real hip-hop, buy this...","Alright, listen folks. If you don't have this CD, go out and buy it! It is a classic old-school CD. If you like Big L, KRS-One, and early Nas, then you'll like this. Fat Joe puts together a flawless list of head-bobbing tracks, featuring an all-star cast (at the time, of course) of well-known artists like Kool Keith, Diamond D, and Kool G Rap. get it"
4,THROWBACK ALBUM,"this is the type of album that you put on if you wanna throw it back a tad. personally, i feel that this is still the best one he did. maybe it is because i come from a different genration of HIP HOP. however, the beats are my type of beats, raw and hardcore!!!! it is not a classic, but for a boring day or for just throwing it back, this album is essential."
5,Simple To Understand Biblical book about end times,I would recommend this book to anyone looking to get a better understanding of what will happen in the last days before christ returns. This helped me to better understand how events will happen and also had a wealth of other relevant information. This is more or less a Dummies Guide without the Dummies label. If you enjoy reading any Idiots guides or Dummies guides and want to brush up on your end times biblical prophecies then buy this.
4,Done well in a for dummies format,If you know nothing about bible prophesy or just want to review the facts its for you
2,Of Rule and Review,"""As specialization and division of labor increase, there is greater demand on the state to provide collective goods where once there were solely private goods or no goods at all.""From the second sentence of this book, it charts its course in oblivious contradiction of reality. In reality, of course, economic activity individuates and privatizes as society develops. The few exceptions, e.g., the Soviet Union, are typically short-lived and embarrassing to their promoters.Ms. Levi is obviously a clever person, but sadly, as with many clever people in academia, her intelligence in this book is deployed mainly to play games of self-referential abstraction.This book's obscurity and practical uselessness mean that it is unlikely to be of any consequence. There probably is a good book to be written on a general theory of comparative taxation, but this ain't it."
5,Beautiful Little Pendant by Peora,This is a lovely pendant. The stone is excellent and the silver setting is excellent. The silver is not icy white as it appears in photo. It looks more like white gold. Even the chain is great quality. It does not twine like some silver chains will do. The photo doesn't do it justice. It is a feminine piece. The way the silver setting frames the the solitare is unique and beautiful. The price is really a give a way. The chain alone is worth more than the asking price. The seller is Peora. Their delivery was super speedy-two days from placing my order and the delivery was free! This is my second purchase from Peora. I am really liking this company.
3,Well researched but seriously flawed,"Dr. Blight offers the following thesis: the South and the North combined to create a reconciled reconstruction after the war which abandoned the emancipationist promises given the African American freedmen. This is , in many ways, no different than the long standing thesis of C. Vann Woodward in his classic work Origins of the South. The flaw in Dr. Blight's work is that there was no such promise of equality to the freedmen that was anything but implied by anyone other than the Radical Republicans and Abraham Lincoln . Those promises existed only so long as the Radical Republicans were able to exert their influence. The true fact is indeed a sad one: the majority of the populations of both the North and the South did not choose to have African Americans on an equal social footing; thus, once the South and North were free from Radical Reconstruction, the true prevailing feeling toward blacks in society was revealed once again."
3,Social history only,"This book was well-written, and clearly well-researched by the author. But to my mind, it did not tell the entire story about successes and failures in reconciliation after the Civil War. It is written very much from the standpoint of social history, so if you are hoping to read about leadership and policy decisions on reconciliation after the Civil War, you will not find much of that here. The author presents very well the readings and writings about the war in the 50 years that followed it, and about the underlying social factors and desires that made reconciliation along with true racial equality either impossible or simply unattained. But without telling about the political decisions that helped or hindered, I felt that part of the story was missing. That said, this book ought to be required reading for Confederate nostalgists."
3,Mixed Bag,"Just look at the price - this is a cheap coffee maker. Keep this in mind when considering this purchase. I'm a student that relies on coffee for my studies/time-wasting sessions. This maker has aided me in that task - I had no idea how to work my old Braun maker. So it fulfills its most basic function - to make coffee in a simple, fuss-free manner. Despite this, I have some small quibbles. First, the filter holder is of an odd shape and does not fit standard filter papers. It sort of defeats the purpose of buying a cheap maker if one most purchase special filters. Secondly, one must manipulate the caraffe just-so in order to insure a drip-free delivery of coffee. It seems inexcusable that a pot designed to pour coffee (not a difficult task!) should occasionally fail. Yes, it is a cheap model, but these very basic design flaws demand at least a 2 star penalty."
5,"simple, basic and cheap","i dont know what people expect for 20 bucks. this coffee maker works very well at what it supposed to do, make coffee. it's also very cheap and very easy to use. in terms of durability, every one of these cheap black and decker coffee makers (that i've ever owned) work well for a few years and then one day suddenly don't work at all. it's then time to buy a new coffee maker. in short, this is a very good, simple, basic, cheap coffee maker. it will probably last at least a couple of years. it's well worth 20 bucks."
2,"7 months old, sprung a leak!!!","We bought this in February. We used it about 5 times a week to brew 4 cups of coffee. Yesterday (9/17) we set it up to brew coffee.....came back into the kitchen 5 minutes later to find that all the water was now over our counter, and in the drawers underneath the counter. Was it our human error? So we checked it over the sink. We poured some water in where the water is supposed to go.....water quickly began dripping out from underneath the water housing unit. Not from the coffee pot mind you. :-( We still haven't got hold of Black and Decker to see if they will replace it or somethingALSO, we only use filtered water in it so no, it was not hard water messing it up somehow....."
1,Won't Hold Up,This coffee maker only lasted 6 1/2 weeks. It was used to make one (1) pot of coffee a day. First sign of trouble was warm coffee now it won't even try to make. B&D use to put out great products but have cut too many corners now.
1,Very disappointed!,"I received this coffee maker from my daughter for Christmas. I started using it on Jan. 4, 2011. I used it everyday and on Jan. 20, 2011 it stopped working. I did not have this even three weeks before it stopped working. I would not recommend this. I think Black & Decker should stick to yard equipment."
1,"Cheap, heat-vulnerable components","Although it still makes decent coffee, after only one month's use its drip-stop thing falls off EVERY TIME, and its plastic snap-on lid no longer fits well - the plastic used in these two areas seems vulnerable to the heat generated. Not good news for a coffee maker.If I had looked back to one lady's review from 2005 (!) I would have seen the same complaint, so B&D; has not addressed this issue in the intervening 5 YEARS!Next stop - some other maker.POSTSCRIPT. After one year's use the maker began leaking, the finish was peeling off the heater plate.The cheap price was not worth the hassle of owning this piece of crap.I downgraded my review from two stars to one star, f.y.i."
1,Possible Fire Hazard,"So.. my mom somehow killed our last Mr. Coffee after 10 years of use.. We wanted to get a simple coffee maker. Black & Decker should be a good brand. From the beginning I noticed a little puddle of water on the counter coming from underneath the maker.. Ok.. No big deal, nothing a towel with the morning brew won't fix. Except if you want 10 cups you will only get 8.. it leaked that much. Then a few months later the on and off button stopped working. So we unplugged it. Then after a brew we would hear a sizzle sizzle sound like the maker shorting out. Instead taking any chances, like a fire, we just had to throw it out! I guess you get what you pay for."
1,awful coffeemaker,This coffee maker makes great coffe but the carafe leaks from 2 spots at the bottom which means the coffee you made will be split between your mug and your counter.definitely get another maker if possible!
2,doesn't last a year,"We bought this coffee pot because we used it at a resort and it made a terrific cup of coffee. We make two or three pots of coffee a day. Our first one broke in less than a year. The internal tubing that carries the water sprung a leak. We thought we got a lemon and ordered another. This time in less than a year the heating element went. My third one broke today also after less than a year. Once again the heating element went bad and the water won't heat or pump. While on the surface a great coffee pot for the price, it gets pricey when you need to replace it this often. I think it's time for me to find another brand of coffee maker."
4,coffee machine,I have only had my coffee maker for about 24 hours but so far it is my favorite ever. The profile is smaller than the last 4 machines I have had which I appreciate since counter space is very spare. The shape of the carafe is friendly - meaning I was able to pour without a drip anywhere which for me is pretty much a miracle. Yeah Black and Decker 12-cup SmartBrew...
2,Good cup of coffee.....short life span.,"Consumers Reports recommended this coffee maker...a ""Best Buy"", so I bought it. It was a good, basic coffee maker. It also took less ground coffee than other makers, to make a decent cup of coffee. The coffee was hot and stayed hot in the carafe, which I liked. I didn't have many of the other problems that people had. Mine just quit one day. It was working perfectly the day prior. I would expect a ""Best Buy"" to last longer than 15 months. I notice it's still on the market....and also $5 higher. I can't recommend this product."
4,Does the Job,"No bells and whistles, just a great cup of coffee. We are on our third one. While that may not sound like a great endorsement, you can't expect a cheap coffee maker to last forever. Expect at least 2 years out of this model. Our first one went because it our water was too hard. Lasted about 3 years though. The switch broke on our last one after 2 years. A better switch would make this a better buy. You get a consistent brew each and every time. What more do you want in a coffee maker."
5,Kalei,This is the first coffee maker that has a larger spout that does not spill when you pour your coffee
5,"Good, no frills coffeemaker","I got mine for $20. (Actually it's my second one.) I wanted an on/off switch and that's it. Coffee is made at the perfect temperature. Sure, it's all plastic. If what you want is easy to make, good coffee on the cheap, then this is the coffeemaker for you."
4,Good coffee each morning,"This is a good coffee maker. It's simple, attractive, and reliable. I enjoy a great cup(or two) of coffee every morning. The item arrived in a timely fashion, was packed very well, and works like a charm."
1,This machine sucks!,"This coffee maker has me so aggrivated, that this is the first review I have ever written. Bought it on 8/12/10. Within a month it was leaking clean water out the back. So much for Amazon's guarentee, 2 days late! Wrote the vendor and have been trading emails for another month.For as cheap as this pot was, just send a new one for good customer service. Today was the last straw. I knew it was taking to long so I went to look at it. Got there just as the top of the filter opened and ALL THE GRINDS and water spilled all over the counter and floor.DO NOT BUY! A real piece of junk. And I also thought B&D; made good products.Tony DiVito"
2,"I like my coffee quiet and hot, thank you!","We purchased this coffee maker in a rush when our 5 year-old Cuininart Coffeemaker we loved died. Big mistake. It does make coffee, however... it's slow, very noisy, and when the pot is done brewing, the coffee is lukewarm! Skip this one!"
3,Black & Decker Coffeemaker,"Coffeemaker rated average, but a good buy at less than $25.Easy using Amazon for order."
2,Coffee maker,Didn't take long for the lid to break off the top of the pot. But still brews good coffee for the price.
4,Pretty good,"This is the simple utilitarian tool without I could not survive morning. One at work, one at home. The first one I bought for work had the timer, but it quit working. This is better because the coffee in it grows more effective as the day goes on."
1,DIED in ONE MONTH !,I am simply astonished that in spite of looking attractive and brewing good coffee this P*O*S* utterly died in only one month of normal use!!! I am furious when you consider what one months worth of coffee has now ended up costing me per cup and I must now purchase yet another machine.You can bet your life it WILL NOT be a Black & Decker!!!
1,Can make excellent beans taste horrible,"I bought this to replace a Gevalia coffee maker that i broke the carafe on. No matter how i ground/measured the coffee in this maker, I could not get the coffee to come out tasting right. The beans and filters i use are top notch and I have had no complaints using them in other people's coffee makers. My one thought is that the water heater they use may not get the water hot enough to extract the flavor from the coffee. Unless you don't mind good beans that end up tasting like Folgers, i'd go ahead and pick up something else."
2,DAMAGED GOODS,ALTHOUGH I LIKE THE BRAND OF THE COFFE MAKER I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED THAT THE MACHINE WAS DEFECTIVE WHEN I RECIVED IT . THE TOP LID WAS BROKEN AT THE SEEMS. VERY DISAPPOINTING .HOWEVER I STILL CAN USE IT BUT NOT SATISFIED WITH THE APPLIANCE CONDITION.
3,Hunt for a New Reader,"Stout's ""The Father Hunt"" is a very entertaining book with some of Stout's best characterizations. Not the best of the Wolfe books, but certainly an enjoyable reading experience. I can't say the same for the audiobook version. The reader (His name I have forgotten.) sounds as if he has never read a Wolfe novel. He misses Archie Goodwin's narrative character completely, reading the book like a Shakespearian actor would read rap lyrics. The reader's only redeeming quality is in his reading of Wolfe's lines, which is tolerable. Book - four stars, reading - 2."
2,not my cup of tea!,I enjoy English mysteries. Unfortunately this wasn't interesting enough to capture my attention. Won't go this route again.
2,"Not the music, but the aura of the man","With Ornstein it is not so much the music but an unrealized aura: the hysteria that surrounded his perfomances, his walking away from fame to devote himself to composing, his stable and long lived family life. Granting dissonance is not for everyone, there are brief airs of musical interest, but they are lost in what can be described best as organized noises. After listening to this, one will be left with two impressions: a piano lesson with Ornstein must have been unrivaled, and it is better to have borrowed this CD then to have bought."
3,how much of the novel is here?,"Charles Williams knew how to write. It is a pity that the publisher of this ""reprint"" did not reasonably proofread prior to going to print. Two pages are entirely blank. Several paragraphs from one page are repeated many pages later. I cannot be certain that I read the entire story as Williams wrote it. I ran in to a similar problem from this publisher in ""Devil Thumbs a Ride"", but it was not nearly as severe. Typos and mispellings abound. As for the novel itself, it is about mid-range Williams, which makes it superior to most in this genre."
1,?? quality,"I have had this item replaced several times, because it has not worked or had something on it broken. I sent Four Seasons photos of the one that I recieved that was broken and they said ""Yes, it should be replaced"" I don't think I would buy this product again."
2,Couldn't finish it,"Got to page 150 and did not think it would ever pick up the pace. Sad when the side stories are more interesting than the main! We get page upon page of descriptions of ice flows and ice bergs. The author does a great job of showing how dull the environment is, but in turn makes a dull story. Like listening to someone go on and on about how dull their trip turned out.The characters are pretty flat and somewhat generic, with Aziz, the three handed man thrown in as a heavy handed (no pun intended) metaphor of madness (we get many of these!).Would like to know more about Kane, the protagonist.The whole story is pretty unbelievable. A group of misfits (some criminal) brought along on a scientific discovery tour?However, I think this book might make a good movie with the potential to develop the characters and the storm sequences (dogs washing around on board is a powerful visual)."
5,Great educational music,"I was so impressed with this CD, with the wide range of audience it entertains. When my 2 year old asks to listen to this cd, I am excited because its definitely something my husband and I find ourselves singing along with too. Music is such a big part of our children's lives and this CD teaches so many things that are important like days of the week, dollar value and counting. I would suggest this cd to all families."
5,A Delicious Resource,"Chefitz' book is a delicious collection of sweet, subtly moving stories inside an overly pretentious wrapper. As a Jewish inspirational storyteller, I have found his tales to be powerful without being heavy-handed; two of them are now part of my core repertoire.You don't need to be Jewish to appreciate these kabalistic stories, however. Read them out loud, savor their sweetness, and be prepared to be touched gently and deeply."
2,Not worth your time or money,"I purchased this book, The Curse of Blessings, based on the reviews here. I have to say that I am very disappointed with this book. I struggled through it and found little to recommend it. For me, it didn't live up to the high ratings given here. The stories are often convoluted, flat, and without inspiration. I feel duped for having purchased a real clunker. Instead, I would recommend Irwin Kula's book, Yearnings, which I have found to be exceptional in its ability to inspire and provide insights into life's challenges."
2,overly simplistic,The stories were overly simplistic and certainly not up to the level of Chefitz' other books
1,not professional at all,"For those people who think it doesn't install on Win XP, IT DOES!!! so why don't you all just get some microsoft updates and SP2 and try again. ON THE OTHER HAND, this product is horrible from a ""serious student"" and ""professional"" perspective. It does not go into very fine detals of all the organs. For example it only names the major bones, muscles, etc. but if you'd like to know where the muscle attachments are, where the groves, necks, trochanters, and fossi are, then just save up this money and get a much better, hard-cover beautifl anatomy atlas. Human 3d is better, but again, not as detailed as grey's anatomy for example which you can buy for 11.95."
1,Not a good investment of your money,I bought explore Human anatomy professional edition the 12 CD collection but I am very disappointed because only 6 of the 12 CDs are installing on xp. Even after they and sent me a third CD to try it didn't work. I got the message it is not compatible with windows xp. I thought it was compatible with xp because it says so on the package. It seems I was fooled buy the makers of professional edition of explore Human anatomy. Please buy something else if you have windows xp if not you will regret it.
2,Not what I expected,This is a fine program for children to learn. I was hoping to get anatomical pictures that I could use for lectures. Some of the picture are of poor quality. There appear to be sections missing and it is not indepth. It is markteted for professionals as well as home use. It is definately is not for professional use.
2,Anatomy,"This software was really easy to install but I was not impressed at all with the quality and quantity of information. It is NOT in depth and 3-D models are very limited. The figures aren't even in anatomical position. This software may be a good resource for gradeschool students but I do not think that ""professional edition"" suits the product AT ALL. All of the things that are included in this software could be found in any highschool anatomy book. Although I expected it, the software was really outdated and simple. I plan on sending the software back for a refund. Overall, it is not worth what I paid and I do not recommend it to college level students and persons in the medical field."
1,Low Quality,"Terrible product. I wanted to used this to help me study for my anatomy class, but the software sucks. If I could, I would return it. Unfortunately after restocking fees it was more convenient to just leave it sittings on the shelf.Save your money and buy something else."
5,DANCO # A0089270 KITCHEN SPRAY HEAD,EXACT REPLACEMENT SPRAY HEAD & THE ONLY PLACE I WAS ABLE TO FIND ONE. Excellent Price too.
4,good for the price,"I need to print mailers, brochures, etc that are in 30+ quantity runs. I needed a cutter to produce quick, accurate and repeatable sizes. It does not have the 1/32 to 1/64 accuracy without several test cuts, each new size setting. I would say that at about half the cost of pro level cutters, this thing ain't bad. To get accurate 4 1/2 inch (half a sheet lengthwise) I had to file the ends of the blue reference bar down a hair. Still, I am pleased and it puts a good, clean cut on heavy stock, multiple sheets at a time."
3,Unsound Engineering,"I am mostly happy with this recording, but anyone considering buying it should know that while the performances are excellent and the lyrics and liner notes fascinating, the vocalist was not well miked. You can hear the instrumentalists just fine, but it sounds as if the vocalist was standing at the back of the room when the recordings were made. The less-than-stellar engineering mars what would otherwise be an outstanding bit of Americana. In spite of that, I'd still recommend it for any true basball fanatic."
2,Like all of Lawler's books: incomplete and biased.,"[...] A martial arts novice could get better information by spending an hour or two on the internet.Lawler is obviously very knowledgable about Tae Kwon Do, but like all her other books, her bias towards it is obvious and the misinformation hits you in the head like a round kick.For the $ you spend on the book, you'd be better off picking up a bunch martial arts magazines at the grocery store or book store."
3,She'd stuck it out for five years,"From back cover - She'd worked hard and long for her boss, Dominic Reynolds. Their relationship was in many ways closer than most marriages. The real man below the dynamic, supercool exterior, however, still eluded Cathy however much she tried to reach him. ""You don't give a damn for anyone's feelings but your own"" she told him. So perhaps it was time to accept that he just wasn't interested in her as a woman and to make a clean break from him. But Dominic's reaction to the news of her leaving was a complete surprise...."
1,"Looks nice, but not at all functional.","We registered for a set of 10 WMF utensils for our wedding. They look great hanging in our kitchen and most all of the utensils are very functional. However, we are now on our second scooper and it has broken now for the second time. Its just not sturdy enough for its intended use...ice cream."
2,Jeopardy 2003 A Rip-Off,"Jeopardy 2003 is a huge WASTE OF MONEY! First of all, the program is flawed because it periodically shuts down. And it will do so in the middle of a game, so be forewarned. Second, all of the questions are exactly the same as the Jeopardy 1st edition game! I thought I was buying a whole new, fun Jeopardy game (because after much play on the 1st edition, my family and I had memorized most of the answers). Instead, I got essentially the same thing as I already owned, only the computerized Alex doesn't have a mustache this time. Furthermore, the ""Tournament of Champions""...totally bogus. It is mostly questions from the regular Jeopardy rounds mixed up to make you think they are the more difficult T.O.C. questions. Overall, this game gets a big fat ZERO with me. The price I paid was NOT well worth it for what I received. Alex and Merv should have thought twice before putting their names on this game..."
1,disappointed- frustrating,"I purchased Jeopardy recently - started playing it - also played with friends - we are disappointed - it is not the quality of fun that playing along with the TV - Having adjusted the controls on answering found Jeopardy pays no attention, on several occasions correct answer and correct spelling having been given - we were told we were wrong and then told the correct answer - which turned out to be EXACTLY what had indeed been answered - this is frustrating and takes all of the joy out of the game - and it does not recognize the players ringing in when it wants to include annonymous - just ignores fact that one of our players has rung in first. Sorry I purchaed it - will not consider purchase of updates as offered.P. Sandler - Florida"
5,this is so much fun!,"We play this game as couples against our friends. Makes for a lot of fun competition. Occasionally a question will be repeated, but seeing as we are all over 40 we can't remember the answers anyway!"
2,Jeopardy 2003 a disappointment,"After being addicted to the second edition of Jeopady I was very excited to play the new Jeopardy 2003. Unfortunately, I found out quickly that not much has changed with this newest edition. I was so disappointed when I found even some of the questions were the same! If you want to see Alex's new look and want to play the higher stakes dollar amounts, then run right out and buy the new Jeopardy 2003. If you're looking for a game that challenges you more than the previous one did, this is not the one to buy."
2,Big disappointment,"In this day and age I assumed all vidio games, exspecially a game like jeopardy or wheel of fortune would have online multiplayer capabilities so you could play with friends online. I was wrong.. that would have made this game a 5 star to me. ..."
5,Read the directions,"Mr. ""Gamer"" from Forest Hills should read the comments from""Theodore John Illenberg (see more about me)"" to see whyhe (gamer) couldn't get answers because he was ""playing withhimself"" while traveling; NOT a good idea (like cell-phones andbooze and driving) ;>)"
2,Solo mode is practice?,"The ""explanation"" for why one doesn't get the correct answers in a solo game--that ""solo mode is practice""--is simply unacceptable. One of the benefits of most computer games is that one can play a full-fledged game against a virtual opponent. It is unlikely, having learned this, that I will purchase this software.However, I don't understand what Douglas Gardner's problem is with the Forest Hills commentator's playing while traveling--playing a game with the audio low or with headphones is not the same thing as yelling into a cellphone--so long as s/he's on public transit and not driving a car!"
4,Tears are a plenty in this moving tale,"Very few books have the rare quality of moving you to tears. The Last Song of Dusk, a sad saga of a couple in the early 1900s in Bombay succeeds in melancholy time and again.It has been beautifully written in a unique style that seems effortless. The characters, the period in time and the emotions have been brought to life and never fail to move you. My heart goes out to Anuradha, Vardhaman, Nandini and Shloka. There lives intertwine painfully and as a reader you are driven to imagine ways of alleviating the pain and making their lives happier.I definitely recommend this book to one and all."
1,Unrealistic!,"Reading this book was a sheer waste of my precious time. It is highly unrealistic and lacks substance in ways more than one. I read this book after I read ""The lost Flamingoes of Bombay"" which I thoroughly enjoyed... and must admit I was disappointed with this book.Sanghvi has borrowed Arundhati Roys style of writing but has fallen flat on his face! Most of the characters were unrealistic apart from Anuradha and Vardhaman and of course the wicked mother in law Divi Bai..."
3,"Promising, Yet Ultimately Falls Short","I have mixed feelings about this book. It kind of reminds me of those kids in school who you knew were absolutely brilliant and capable of straight A's, yet managed only a B average. Shanghvi's prose is lush, his analogies satisfying, yet he almost drowns himself in his own script as the book moves on. The characters are certainly interesting, yet lose their momentum towards the end of the novel. The plot loses it's zest, becoming bogged down in his own philosophical reveries that can exhaust the reader with it's ambiguity (which you could argue, is the point, however, there is only so much ambiguity a reader can take). I look forward to what this writer will produce in the future, and, considering this was his first novel, I'd say he did a good job overall."
2,Beautiful language but the rest not so much,"From the moment I started reading this novel I was captivated by the beauty of Shanghvi's words. But as the story moved on it got more and more unrealistic. The characters and what they stood for was all far too ambitious and I lost interest, I just stuck through it to find out what happened. It is beautifully written but thats about it. Shanghvi tried to take the story into a million different directions but it did not work out. I wish it were a lot more simpler and honest"
3,I't ok,I didn't finish it. A friend recommended the author but I couldn't get into the book. Some may like it better than I.
3,Excellent detailed description biblical doctrines.,"Pearlman gives an easy to follow, detailed -- yet brief -- description of virtually all the basic biblical doctrines (e.g., salvation, sin, etc...). I found the book easy to read and quite informative. I am a little hesitant to recommend it because of Pearlman's theological background, but it is a good book (I am going to read it again, but I didn't find anything really off the wall the first time through)."
1,Garbage,"Useless blathering. I read the first half closely, expecting something useful, skimmed the rest of the book, and then literally dropped it in the waste basket - something I cannot recall ever doing with a book I have purchased. Don't waste your money or, more importantly, your time on this book."
5,Dance to the beat of Electrotheque,This is one of the best cover songs that I have ever heard with it's funky beats and awesome effects. It'll guarantee to keep anyone dancing for a long time.
2,NOT brown but good olive drab shorts,"Despite the title of the advertisement and the seller's adamant description these are indeed olive drab and NOT brown. My department specifies we use brown slacks/bdus/shorts and I thought I had finally found some brown shorts that looked decent (the shorts themselves are worth more than the price just realize, they ain't brown, no not at all and do NOT look like the item advertised herein) but alas they are Olive Drab and looks like I have to use Amazon's A-Z return as no response back from seller :("
4,Good Introductory Textbook,"The book is a mixure of textbook and cases book so it should be a good introductory textbook. Probably practitioners may find it convenient. However, it will be better if the authors would consider to give further academic and practical discussion about the difficult areas such as Internet jurisdiction. The only disappointment is the authors did not give sufficient dicussion about the Choice of Law on Internet, especially after the influential argument put forward by Johnson and Post relating to the nature of Internet as a borderless environment. Good coverage anyway."
2,not a good stuff,"although the purpose of the book is a good and extensive one, review the literature about supervenience in a cross field way (mind-body, ethics) and the different perspectives about the realism-anti-realism, most of the time what is achieved is a kind of impressionist and empty view of the debate where the main players are mentioned but not rightly debated. The chapter about ethics is especially weak and the model presented in the end of the first chapter seems more like a dream of what supervenience should be than what was proved to be."
2,Not so Good,"Although this toy does come with some nice stencils and activity pack, it does not have any place to store them and there is no way to attach them to the table so it is hard for my daughter to hold the paper steady. If I had it to do over I would not buy this."
2,Well Wrought but not Fun to Read,"John Ciardi's footnotes were excellent. I would not recommend the Paradiso or Purgatorio to anyone, though all should read the Inferno.A.D. 1300 Heaven is an interactive laser light show set to vocal music--or, more accurately, that is how it is presented to the poet so he can grasp it."
2,I stopped reading a third of the way through,"I thought this was going to be a great book. I heard good things about it and it started out great. But, then I was just completely bored and not into it. I kept waiting for something to happen and maybe it did; I just wasn't patient enough to stick with it."
2,If you like Lifetime movies...,"If you like Lifetime movies, then you may like this novel. It is about the repercussions arising from a doctor giving away his Down's syndrome daughter (Phoebe) at birth and keeping the secret from his family, including his wife. This coincidence-filled premise is particularly hard to believe.The gradual estrangement that occurs between the doctor and his long-suffering wife over the years was effectively presented, but other relationships and characters are not: after 30 years of timidity and safety, the nurse Caroline takes Phoebe and flees to raise her; Paul, the son of the doctor, hates his father despite a presentation of kindness of care; the doctor suddenly takes in a pregnant runaway to look after; a Fabio-like character (Frederick) swoops in to sweep the doctor's wife of her feet.This book appeals more to the emotions than the intellect, but is not effective in doing so. I can not recommend it."
2,Too melodramatic for me,"The beginning of the book seemed like it should have said 1864 instead of 1964 because in the 60's people were not this ignorant. Maybe it's because I am a nurse and the character of the nurse was absolutely cliche, as was the doctor.Somehow, I put that aside and started reading because it was an interesting plot. Another reviewer said that you never got the perspective from the daughter, and I agree, the book suffered from that. Also, WAY too much detail and sideplots.Not my cup of tea."
3,Good but not great,"I think this book started out pretty good. The premise is unusual, the characters are interesting, but after the nurse takes Phoebe away and moves with her to another state is when the story started to get dull. There wasn't much interaction between the nurse and the father who gave his child away, although there are a few scenes. I would have liked to have read more drama between the two separate character story lines."
2,"Maddening, Dysfunctional Characters","I yelled, ""No!"" at this book as I read it. There's not one decent character in it. David never overcomes his deception that sets the whole thing going. At any point he could confess with some honesty. Instead he feels overly guilty and responsible for things he is not responsible for. Norah has affairs and extreme escapist behavior. Paul steals. None of the relationships are healthy. They all become cold, distant and anger filled and have unhealthy hidden feelings. These things creep into Caroline and Al and others, too. All the characters and their love relationships blur into one another. All the characters are escapist in one way or another. The problems in one appear in others for no good reason. Even strange little quirks like concern with smelling the scent of the person a character is kissing jumps from character to character to character for no reason.In short, this book frustrated and irritated me. Somehow I finished it."
2,Not good enough!,"In the beginning of this book it seemed like an interesting story was going to develop, but unfortunately it became dull and basically the same theme was repeated throughout making it a tiresome read. Towards the last half, I just wanted the story to end. It went on too long. Don't waste your valuable reading time on this one!"
4,Fascinating story,"This story pulled me right in and kept me interested until the very end. I stayed up way too late 2 nights in a row because I couldn't stop reading. I liked the contrast between the two families; the downs syndrome child brought so much joy to Caroline, while the big mistake/secret damaged the Henry family so deeply. Like Paul, I am unsettled by the thought of what it would have been like if life had taken a different path. I would have liked to see a bit more character development. Caroline, Norah, and Paul didn't always seem like real people that I'd like to know. There was a certain distance to the storytelling. Overall, well worth the time, a great read."
3,"For such a controversial subject, it was pretty blah","Unlike everyone else, I have to say I didn't like the writing. The story was intriguing and I had a hard time putting it down because I wanted to know what would happen next, but I thought the writing was very boring. The most exciting events in the novel had the same monotonous, descriptive tone as the most mundane events in the characters lives, and found myself wishing I had skipped entire paragraphs because they contained nothing but blah blah blah. As for the ending? That was the most boring part of the whole book -- it was wayyyyy too predictable. Here's my other beef with the story: I thought there were too many characters that were supposed to be important but ultimately weren't. These characters just took up space in the novel that could have been used to contribute to the plot. I enjoyed reading this novel but it could use a lot of improvement."
2,Not what I expected . .,"I was really hoping this would be one of those books I would be glad I read. However, I was ultimately disappointed. I never really connected with any of the characters and the ending seemed quite dull. I'm not sure what I was expecting. I suppose I was expecting something a bit more dramatic or exciting. Personally, I thought the book was kind of dull."
2,What was wrong with these people?,I don't know why I didn't stop reading half way through the book. By the time I finished I wanted to slap the author and all the characters. I realize it was the 60's but PLEASE. Although it spanned a 20 year time period it seemed like everyone was stuck in a time warp. I thought The Memory Keeper's Daughter would have focused ON THE DAUGHTER but she seemed to be an insignificant part of the story. The author dronned on and on with flowery discriptions that really didn't help the story line.I was very disappointed with the book.
1,"EXTREMLY depressing, dreary and i wanted to slap the characters","It had no high points or good points...I hated the characters, and like another reader said...i got half way through and had to shut the book. Luckily, I had a friend who read it and told me what happened and i was so glad that i didn't waste my time on something so wrong and so depressing. I was like another reader ...i wanted to slap the author too. ugh!!!"
1,Not my cup of tea,"I found the history extremely compelling at the beginning. But eventually the whole story was a drag.The author seemed to have in mind a Lifetime movie for her book and spent all the time with peripheral descriptions that were insulse and annoying.The characters were superfically developed and I spent the whole time trying to feel the drama, but it was not possible.The positive part of the book is that is very easy to read and has a simple history line."
1,Couldn't even finish it!,"I was really intrigued by the premise of this story. The beginning hooked me and I was unable to put the book down. What happened? It seemed like time stopped and I could barely force myself to keep reading. In fact, I lost the battle. I gave up shortly after Paul's recital. I would rather live without knowing how this family turned out than have to read one more sentence. (That is a huge concession for me because I hate leaving things unfinished.) It was death by slow, tortuous boredom. The author had this incredible idea for a story that started out so fascinating, yet quickly fizzled. It's like she ran out of steam and forced herself to finish the book just because. It was a huge shame."
2,Looking for an ending...,"Edwards does a fantastic job of hooking the reader into this book, but the ending is sheer disappointment. It also has a tendancy to skip through time in a way that leaves things feeling fragmented. The beginning though was terrific and I think that is why the rest of the book felt that it was lacking. Overall, I was really surprised that this book has been this popular."
2,Disappointing....,"This book was recommended to me, and I was excited to read it, because I thought the premise was fascinating. However, the book quickly became disappointing. The characters were not well-developed, and by the end they felt like one-dimensional clichés. I did not understand why Norah and Paul were so unhappy throughout the entire book. They never knew David's secrete until after he passed away. The character voices did not ring true to me."
1,"Nice writing based on a flimsly premise,","I have a hard time understanding why anyone enjoyed this book. The entire novel is based on a weak premise that just doesn't fly. The author's style is nice, but every character is one dimensional and lacking depth. Do yourself a favor, skip this one. I won't even donate my copy to the library. It was that lame."
2,Could Have Been So Much Better,"The premise of this story was great, however the author just couldn't pull it off. It was like sliding into a whining depression with no hope for escape. The characters were very two dimensional, and just like they weren't there for each other; they were not there for the reader either. I found myself skimming the book just so I could see what would happen. Could have been so much better."
3,Good book but not great,I was drawn to this book by the beautiful cover. It was very compelling at first but lost momentum as I went on. The characters became too dramatic and not real. As I approached the mid point I felt I was reading a book by a very young author who was trying to invent unreal reactions by her characters. It is still an intersting book to read but lacked that special something.
2,"Creative Writing 101: Show, Don't Tell","I picked up this book fascinated by the story line on the back cover, but as I began to read, I found myself scratching my head in wonder. I felt as though the author had a severe case of ADD, and I had just spent 14.00 to be jarred around in this mysterious world of aimless thought. It was very disappointing. Honestly, I felt the author was trying to see how lyrical she could be with the English language rather than truly telling a story with depth.It's not good to assume your reader has no imagination, and frankly, defeats the purpose of writing to begin with (entertainment via fantasy). It's rather insulting to the reader, not to mention boring and monotonous, and ultimately makes for bad storytelling, in my opinion.In short, I found the author's writing style tedious and extreme which ultimately dampened the story and the characters."
1,"Had high hopes, but couldn't finish it.","Like many other people, I truly was excited about picking up this book. The premise touched my heart and I couldn't wait to get it. Unfortunately, once I dug in the book became tedious and I couldn't relate to the characters. Once I realized that I didn't care what happened to them, I had to stop reading. I'm a very soft hearted person (which means I cry at movies often) so if this book didn't touch me, it may not touch you either."
2,r-e-a-d-i-n-g,"This book was like a marathon, it got off to a good start, but felt so slow and forced toward the end, almost bordering on corny. The type of book where you skim through pages just to get to the next big thing, which never actually happens. A so-so read"
5,HEARTWARMING BOOK,"THIS BOOK WAS GIVEN TO ME BY A FRIEND WHO THOUGHT I WOULD REALLY LOVE IT. HE WASN'T WRONG. I ENJOYED THIS BOOK SO MUCH I ORDERED MANY MORE FOR FRIENDS AND FAMILY. THIS BOOK WILL KEEP YOU READING DAY AND NIGHT. IT IS HEARTWARMING, LOVELY, KIND, SAD, AND VERY INTENSE AT TIMES. IT IS A MUST READ FOR EVERYONE (ADULT). AMAZON HAS THE MOST AMAZING PRICES, HOW CAN YOU RESIST NOT BUYING IT TO SEE WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. ENJOY!"
2,Trite,"Gave up on page 7, after a ridiculous boy-meets-girl scene that is both hackneyed and implausible."
2,Separated twins and damaged lives,"I thought the concept of this book was interesting: twins who were separated at birth by their father, a doctor, because one child has Down's syndrome. The wife thinks the child was born dead. The nurse, the only other person present at the birth, chooses to raise the baby instead of taking her to an orphanage. The book follows the parallel lives of the two children, although it focuses on the father, David and the consequences that his actions and the secret have on his life and his family, particularly his wife. I found this book difficult to get into, and was never really drawn to most of the characters. This is not a light story, although there are some pleasant moments. On the whole, it is rather dark in tone. The writing was well done, but the story did not hold my interest and the ending was not my favorite."
1,Not worth committing to memory...,"Although I really wanted to like this book, it just didn't work out. It started out pretty strong and then ended so weakly that I couldn't believe I had wasted so much time on it. It took me nearly a year to get through, just because I would pick it up, read a chapter, then ignore it for month. It did nothing to keep me interested and wanting more. I like a book that grabs me, pulls me in and leaves me craving the next page when it's time to put it down, but this novel was just way too easy to put away and forget.I grew up with a sibling with disabilities, which might make me a bit more sensitive to some of the topics of this story. I didn't appreciate the unnecessary use of the ""r"" word, either. I realize that the book was written to take place during a period in time before the more politically correct terminology of today, but still...there's no need to abuse it so heavily.If I could un-read this book and have that time back, I'd be thrilled."
3,"good, but not a favorite","Great premise. I was intrigued for awhile. Then it seemed to drag. I found it pretty depressing actually. If I love a book I read it every free second I have. I did get through this fairly fast, but not with an overwhelming need to finish."
1,Too Long,"This book was boring, repetitive and melodramtic.How many times does the author have to write about the loss and effect on lives?Poor Paul. A father that didn't pay enough attention to him so he is angry. Get over it. How many kids grew up in the 50s and 60s who did not receive time or attention from their fathers? This was a lifestyle for many. I like the changes of today but I and my siblings certainly didn't hate my father because he was never there. Nor did others I know. How many parents want their son to be a guitar player? an artist? Such resentment for asking the child to consider alternatives seems over emotional.David was too unreal and finding and taking in Rosemary was over the top and went nowhere. It just didn't sit well for a plot or coincidence. Although I liked Carolyn the story always seemed to drag. Surely the author could have told the story in far fewer words and descriptions.I felt I was reading the same theme over and over in slow motion."
2,I am shocked at the hype this puerile novel has received,"Its not a bad story--the idea of twins seperated at birth is archetypal, and the controling distant husband accidentally sending his wife into a spiral of depression is appealing. Unfortunately, the appeal wears off in the first few chapters and the rest of the book goes down a long spiral of melodrama. This novel becomes ridiculously emotional, does way too much telling and forgets to show, is rife with cliches and does a terrible job of attempting to portray the trials and tribulations of parenting a disabled child.I was incredibly disappointed."
3,"Another ""Eh"" for Effort","I agree with the aforementioned reviews. This book was an okay read, but not great. The writing was just ok, and the plot and characters were not always very believable. It had the potential to be a great book, but it fell a bit short. Especially in the area of character development... the only character who was really developed well was Phoebe. Plus, this is just a thing I have, but it really bugged me that the author wrote Down's Syndrome throughout the book... every healthcare professional I've talked to has told me it's Down Syndrome, not Down's Syndrome. Anyway, I passed the book on to my elderly mother-in-law after I'd finished reading it, and she just loved it and has been passing it on to all of her friends. So if you like a light read, go for it."
3,"Decent Read, but not a page turner","I think this book has a great premise: What is going to happen to the family and the baby girl David sent away? In reality, it really does not go anywhere. About halfway through the book, I was pretty bored and just wanted to finish it for the sake of finishing it. You don't grow to love any of the characters since there is not much character development and it is a pretty dry read overall."
1,Drags on,"I thought this would be a good book based upon the description and reviews. It caught my attention in the beginning, but it quickly dragged on. I was bored and actually switched to another book with 50 pages left - BORING and not believable. Don't waste your money.Too much drama over the death (or not) of a newborn."
3,Memory Keeper's Daughter,"Interesting book about how one of life's ""mistakes"" can affect a person for the rest of their life and those around them."
5,The Memory Keepers Daughter,"This was a very compelling book about what happens when you lie about something terribly important. The lie changes the lives of all involved; some for the good and some for the worst. I really enjoyed the way this was written, the premise and the results of what one person can do which changes not only his own life but his whole family as well."
2,Michelle,The book was a quick read but pretty depressing and boring at times. I would not recommend it.
3,"A good, but not great, read","I was drawn in by the reviews on the back cover of this book - the novel was praised by several writers who I admire a great deal: Sue Monk Kid, Ursula Hegi, and Sena Jeter Naslund. I thought that the plot sounded intriguing, and as I read the first 20 pages in the bookstore, the lovely quality of Edwards' writing led me to make an impulse purchase! I continued to be hooked through the next one hundred pages of the book, which only covered the first year of the twins' and their parents' lives. I felt that I was really getting to know the characters. However, when the time period then jumped very quickly from age 6, to age 13, and then to age 18 , my interest wavered. I didn't feel that I knew them at all anymore, so I was no longer as invested in knowing the final outcome . What was initially a very promising novel, turned out (for me) to be just average."
2,Plodding and redundant,"The overuse of imagery & descriptive prose bogged this novel down with too little dialogue and story that moved too slowly. It transpired through decades yet each character seemed painfully stuck in time and never grew from their experiences. Her overuse of flowers as descriptions and repetitive use of photography descriptions distracted from the story. It was such a boring, plodding, redundant book. I'm sorry I wasted the time on it. Better luck next time."
3,Good book with the potential to be much better,"This book had so much more potential. It was off to a great start then I just got bored. The book starts strong with a very intense story line and plot but falls flat in the middle through to the very end. I gave the book three stars because it did get me to keep reading in order to learn more about the characters. Also, the author had a nice descriptive writing style. I just wish she would have gotten more into Phoebe and less on the unneeded details that made the book just drag on and on. Unlike others that posted stating they did not feel for any of the characters I did feel for Phoebe and I wanted her to marry Robert!...LOL. I did though, and I know she knew what true love meant. It is a shame that I just wanted to get many of the chapters over with to get back to what really mattered in the story. Over all not terrible but could have been much better."
2,Reads like a bad romance novel,"This author seems preoccupied with thin women, their flat stomachs, their hair swept up into chignons, and how they tuck their legs up under themselves. The prose is too precious. The book takes its time early on, then lurches forward abruptly. Every major character seems to have stepped right out of a soap opera: the mother is wildly successful, the father is a successful doctor AND photographer, the son is a successful musician, the nurse is a fierce political advocate--not an average person among them. And for all its empathy toward people with Down syndrome, none of the book is told from the daughter's perspective. This book isn't about the daughter, it's about everyone in the family except the daughter. It's about the effects her existence and her disability had on the family. She is little more than a plot device, which is disappointing."
1,Slow and repetitive.,"I'm sorry, but I really do not understand the high reviews here. I lost interest in the book about a chapter in. It's slow and repetitive. let me sum it up for you (w/o spoiling the ending):Couple is in love, they have two children. Man lies to wife and says the girl died at birth because he remembers how hard it was for him to have a sister with health problems. Nurse takes girl and raises her on her own.Wife is depressed about ""loss"" of daughter. Paranoid that son will die as well.Son's baby hands look like starfish.Husband remembers his dead sister and the jam his mother made, which looked like jeweled cans.Son becomes older. His hands still look like starfish. Father remembers the jars of jam again, like jewels.Children grow older....Starfish, jewels. Starfish, jewels. Starfish, jewels.In case you haven't gotten it yet, children's hands look like starfish, and jars of jam look like jewels. Got it?The end."
2,Plot suffers from Author's style,"The plot of this book could have been interesting, but the author keeps telling us the same things over and over such as Norah's eyes are green. One of the characters, Caroline reminded me of a chacter that Shirley Jackson might have thought of. If Shirley Jackson were alive and had written this book, it would have been a third as long and much more interesting. I had to struggle to read this."
3,Fizzles,"I read many glowing reviews of this book before I bought it, so perhaps my expectations were too high. I wanted to like it, and I found that it starts out well - the opening and pivotal drama pulled me in right away. But the author wasn't able to sustain that drama. There's this initial traumatic event, and then the two families' lives unfold, and various episodes of ""acting out"" are all tied back to that initial trauma, over and over again, till it becomes wearisome. (Warning: spoilers ahead.) Mom has an impulsive, rather icky affair because she thinks her daughter died at birth. Huh? Son steals car and runs away because he thinks his sister died at birth. Huh? I'm sure that family traumas have lasting and recurring effects, but these weren't convincing or even particularly compelling. After awhile, I was exhausted and annoyed by the Heavy, Heavy Significance of it All."
4,Moving but sad,"Very well written, a glimpse into how the past shapes your future. A split decision and so many lives were changed forever!"
3,Had some good points but very repetitive.,"I liked the idea behind the book and I did somewhat enjoyed the read, but I found it repetative to the point I skimmed many passages. How many times does the giving away of Phobe have to be mentioned and the impact on their lives? The book was very familiar and I wonder if there was a telly movie made of it...or was it that predicatable?I also did not find some of the characters believable, Nora particularly.Its an okay read and I only read it because it was a bookclub book, I would not have chosen to read it otherwise and I think my initial reaction was correct.It was a shame with such a good story line to work with it fell flat, predictable and repetitive, better editing would have done wonders."
3,Good book,Listened to this as an audiobook. I liked the story and felt connected to the characters. Not the best book I've read in my life but worth it nonetheless.
3,"Well written, but depressing.","I couldn't put this book down, but in the end, I felt incredibly down on life. The books is dark, dark, dark. There are many passages about each character's past--as if they're trapped in their memories, which conveys this sense of helplessness about life."
4,Great book - couldn't put it down!,"I really enjoyed this book, and found that I couldn't put it down. Edwards allows you to get really involved with the characters, and sympathise with all viewpoints. I would have one caveat: the subject matter was quite sad and depressing, and so I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who wants a happy and jolly read!"
3,Good book.,"I've read this book on my trip to Chicago. I was stuck in several airports because of bad weather, so I actually finish it before I got to my destination. It is a good book, although some of the characters could have been developed a little more."
3,Great premise - execution disappointing!,"I was totally drawn to the promise of this book. The plot was totally intriguing...yet the more I read the less interested I became. When I read a book I want to know the characters, know what they do and why. I felt that at times author threw 'stuff' in and never went anywhere with it...Norah's drinking, Paul's car episode, Phoebe and Robert, Al and Caroline, Rosemary. I totally lost it the chapter after Paul fixed the sink....what the heck!I hate to say it but I think that the rave reviews about this book have more to do with the reader's emotional state and/or life experience. If I had lost a child at birth, or had a child with Down syndrome I think my connection with the book would have been stronger but that has nothing to do with the merit of this book as literature.I was really disappointed, bored (and I don't get bored often) and exasperated by the time I finished the book."
1,A very good example of very bad writing.,"This book was one of the worst I have read in years. It is so poorly written that I was cursing aloud at it, and with its weak character development, and such a thin, though sad but hardly believable story line, I find it very hard to believe it made it to any best-seller list. Though I don't like to abandon books once I've started reading them, this is surely one that I should have put down long the end. There are far too many really good, well-written books out there to waste your time on this one."
2,Did not like,"I found this story very simplistic, repetative and not well written at all. I thought the book began well, but the same themes and ideas kept being repeated: David's sadness over his sister's death and therefore his overprotetivness, David's guilt over giving away his daughter,Phobe's sadness over the loss of her daughter...I found it tedious and not engaging."
1,Poorly written,"Picked this one up at a bus station for a long ride because the storyline seemed interesting. Unfortunately, the plot goes nowhere; the characters are shallow, uninteresting, and poorly (if at all) developed; and the writing is painfully slow and amateurishly overly-detailed. I stuck it out to the end just for the sake of finishing it, but it was a waste of time."
1,Instantly forgettable.,"As others have said the premise of this story is promising, but sadly the writing style is pedestrian and mundane."
1,Disappointing.,"This book has all of the elements to be a fantastic story and novel. Sadly, I found it lacked depth and was a little melodramatic. There were a lot of characters and their individual stories seemed to remain on the surface. Any emotions remained in their head and they interacted with each other very little. I'm sure this emotional isolation had a point but it was more frustrating to read than sympathize with."
2,"Ordinary, mundane","I read this for a book club and have had much better reads. I felt the characters were not that sympathetic and did not draw me in. Norah seemed all too cliche. It was ok, but for someone who has little time outside of working and motherhood, I wished we would not have picked this for book club."
3,Starts to move around the year '1977',"Bittersweet tale about a man who gives away his daughter at birth because she has Down's Syndrome.At first I felt I had to wade through some of Kim Edward's florid prose, but by the section of the book called ""1977"" the story seemed to take off and move along at a smoother pace. As with all over-hyped books there were high expectations that I knew couldn't be met, so I read without trying to set myself up for disappointment. I got more interested in the story as it progressed and was surprised how much I enjoyed it overall. Being from Kentucky, it was a treat reading about settings of which I was familiar. I do recommend it with the caveat that story doesn't seem to take off until the middle."
4,The impact of a life changing decision,Great book that chronicles the impact of a life altering decision over a life time. Great character development and storyline. A touching book.
3,Not as schmaltzy as I thought it would be,"I was dreading reading this book that one of my bookclub members chose--it didn't seem like it would be well written and I didn't want to read about a million terrible things happening to children. However, the story was engaging enough and a quick enough read that it kept my attention. Also, it wasn't the giant sob story I expected it to be, so I would say this book is passable. I thought this would be like a Wally Lamb book, where everything miserable keeps happening and it is inescapable, but the book was more life-like: the story had more realistic ups and downs."
2,300 pages too long,"The plotline for this book had such great potential but it was lost in plodding, boring details rather than character development. I was disappointed at the way it dragged on and I found myself skipping over big chunks of the story because they were completely unnecessary. The endless comparisons between photography and life had me saying out loud, ""All right, already!! I get it!!"" Too bad it took too long to get to a rather unsatisfying conclusion."
4,Memory Keepers Daughter review,The author went to a lot of trouble to present a story of how communication is a problem for some people and especially within a marriage. I liked her solutions and she offers touches of grace to her characters as they follow their hearts and do only what they can do. Her point is well taken that we humans can do not much else. We think we could have taken this or that path but in actuality we don't unless we read and talk with others with hearts open to our wounds.
5,bravo!,"Excellent! The complex story was well developed-I was enticed from beginning to end. The author describes the thought processes of each character and how they evolved so well that the reader can easily understand the emotions and actions of choice. I felt I would do and feel the same things. The characters chose paths in their lives to compensate for emptiness, yearning, loneliness, guilt, acceptance (Al) and patience (to disability), yet all are at equilibrium with the beauty and innocence of Phoebe, the hidden, disabled daughter."
2,Not a keeper,"This book had a intriguing plot and I expected it to be a page turner, but by page 137 I gave up (an uncommon response for me) because the characters and their lives as developed weren't very interesting to me."
1,zzzzzzzzzzz,"What a pitiful attempt at what could have been a very interesting story. Every time I go into Barnes and Noble I am astonished that this book is a bestseller. I just wanted to cry with frustration. Whenever it seemed that it would pick up and get going, the book would simply just stall again. The author does a poor job of characterizing men and their feelings. They come across as far too feminine. Wayyyy to much description for descriptions' sake, and no informational value. You feel no connection to the characters at all, and really do not care about them, their mundane lives, goals, etc....This is the second book that I couldn't finish this summer, and since I have a reading challenge bet going with a friend I really hated to do it. But trying to forge through was simply torturous. Walk away, far away from this book next time you pass it at your bookstore."
3,"Great premise, doesn't deliver","This book started with a thought-provoking premise. I wondered how the author would justify the actions at the center of the novel. Unfortunately, I became more and more disappointed with each chapter. It's sad that the author spoiled the idea behind this book with so many unlikeable characters and poor writing. She gets too caught up in description and doesn't deliver the plot to move you through the book."
1,boring and repetitive,"I agree w/ Auliya's review of Sept 1st - It was sooo boring and repetitive that midway through I just started ""scan reading"" to see if anything new or interesting happened.I was very disappointed, especially since it was so highly recommended. The quality of writing was just so annoying, and I'm sure this will be turned into one of those made for TV movies.Ugh."
2,Lightweight fare,"Despite a promising opening, there is too much soap opera in this novel for serious lovers of literature."
2,Just not good,"I didn't care about a single one of these characters. Many times an author will develop one character and neglect the others, but Edwards manages to turn everyone into a one dimensional cutout, which is really sad considering the story had so much potential."
2,Heck Naw,"Most of the other reviewers have already said what I think about this long, drawn-out, never-ending story that will put you to sleep after the first couple of chapters. Seriously, it's not even that much of a story since the book is about a fourth narrative and three fourths bizarre descriptions of completely unimportant things (""...she was looking at expensive stockings as dark as pig's blood..""). But I don't want to get too into what I think about her writing style because everyone else, especially that review called ""Life Is Too Short to Read Books Like This"", totally nailed my thoughts. So the only reason I wrote this is to say that I kind of think that Kim Edwards wrote the ""Read This, read this, read this!"" review. Actually, I'm almost totally sure."
2,Too much angst,"The premise for this book was interesting, but it was somewhat tedious to live through each character's angst. The only happy character has Down's Syndrome. Everyone else has ""issues."" Ranging from depression to cancer--an entire Merck Manual or DSM V of diagnoses. An okay read--but what a downer."
2,"Important character dies, insipid one lives","This story offered a wonderful premise, but fell flat for me when the Doctor, the interesting, complex character suddenly dies, and the insipid, travel agent wife lives on to finally feel good about herself. I felt the Doctor/husband had a more compelling story and therefore, as a reader I had much more invested in him. Why would the author spend that time on him and not redeem him in a more satisfying way? That was a nagging question after I read the last page.That aside, the author did have a compelling story line, and a plot that moved well part of the time."
3,Too many unbelievable parts,"Overall I thought the book was okay, but a few things bothered me. One, the character of the young pregnant girl that pops up for no good reason (and disappears a few chapters later.) That whole storyline was just an annoying distraction from the true plot. Two, the author glides over major events (David's death) with one sentence. The whole book revolves around his relationship with Paul, yet he doesn't even attend the funeral? And his mother's excuse was she didn't know how to get in touch with him? Ridiculously unbelievable. The last frustrating thing is that Norah supposedly pined for her daughter all her life, then when she finally finds her, she leaves the country? There's no way any mother would do that.The best thing about the book for me was watching Phoebe grow up. Having a special needs child of my own, this part really touched me."
4,Enjoyable read!,"I had heard how emotion-filled this book was and opened the pages with apprehension. What I found, however, was an enjoyable page turner, and an easy read for a long trip in the car. Yes, there are deep emotions that run through this story, but that is what gave the characters depth. I feel like I know them all personally and I am sure this novel will stay with me longer than most."
2,It kept going and going and going....,This book started out interesting but I just wanted it to end! The story was believable for it's time but I think the author filled it with about 5 chapters too many. I ended up reading the last chapter to end the agony and then started reading again from where I left off.I found every character (with the exception of Al) cold and distant and I never did get the part about David Henry and the issue around his name and medical school. What was that all about?
3,Phony characterization and a push to span the years,"This book has few good qualities: at times, emotions are raw and believable. Edwards also has good use of imagery. That said, the majority of the book is unbelievable and rings hollow.We are supposed to believe that a man gives up his daughter because of how his ailing sister affected his and his mother's life. We are also supposed to believe that a profoundly troubled marriage would last decades.Edwards also pushes the story along through the decades so the reader can see how relationships resolve themselves and whether or not the secret is ever revealed. But these skips forward seem forced, merely there to carry the story forward."
4,Couldn't put it down...,I really enjoyed this book. I took it with me on our trip overseas and couldn't put it down. I am a third grade teacher and never get a chance to read 'adult' books so this was a great choice! It is a story we could relate to...you never know where your life can lead.
4,This one was good,"While not the type of book I prefer to read, it was a well written story. I didn't enjoy the content overall, but it was very descriptive."
3,a bit disappointed,"when i first read the description on the back of this book i was excited by the concept and bought it right away to take on vacation with me. but after the first few chapters, i became disappointed by the predictability of the story's progression and the sort of romance-novel language. i'll finish it just to see how it all turns out, but i abandoned it while on vacation and took up ""fall on your knees"" by ann-marie macdonald, for the third time, which is simply brilliant. if you want buried family secrets and tragic plotlines, that's the book to read."
1,I found this book offensive,"As a mom of a little girl with Down syndrome I found this book extremely offensive. The author repeatedly used the phrase 'retarded' and portrayed Phoebe as a very outdated steroetype - chubby & short with a pudding bowl haircut, slow thick hard to understand speech etc. Times have changed, children with developmental delays are now having intensive early intervention therapy, attending mainstream schools etc. I hated this book, I really felt insulted on my daughters behalf."
2,not so good,"It was an interesting story line but I didn't feel like the plot got much thicker...just more depressing. I ended up skipping through the last 5 chapters or so becasue I couldn't stand reading about the depressing lives of the characters. I guess I thought it was going to be more about the daughter with down syndrome rather than the effects of the lies. Anyway, if you like depressing books that dont get too interesting this book is for you. However, on a good note...the author is a fantastic writer just needs a better story to write."
3,The Memory Keeper's Daughter,"This book is very well written; however, I found it very sad although probably more on the truthful side if it had been true."
2,Tread carefully into this dark realm,This book is an emotional minefield. It was 1 of our 1st bookclub books and evoked so much emotion the roon spun. We all could appreciate the writing quality but for me it was a case of I have started so I will finish. (A bit like mastermind if you are over 30 and from the UK). There was not a single charcter I aspired to or liked deep down and I found it to be quite depressing. Overated is my main issue with this book.
2,WASTE OF TIME,"FIRST FEW CHAPTERS ARE PAGE TURNERS, THEN IT'S AS THOUGH THE AUTHOR GREW FATIGUED OR COULDN'T FIGURE OUT HOW TO TIE IT ALL TOGETHER SO SHE JUST GAVE UP. THE STORY IDEA HAD POTENTIAL, THE CHARACTERS WERE WELL DRAWN, THEN THE AUTHOR SAID ""AH, FORGET IT""."
1,So dissapointed,I kept waiting for something to happen and it never did! So dissapointing... Save your money.Maybe someone should write the sequel and include everything that was missing in this book.
2,Keeps you waiting...,"I chose this book because of the connection of having had a severely mentally retarded brother in essentially the same time period who was not hidden away. It was a fascinating glimpse at the tendencies of the time, which also led me to be a special educator for the past 30+ years. However, my fascination ended at that societal level. I tried to find a character that I liked or could relate to in the book, but all of them seemed flat and uninteresting. I kept waiting for something to happen, but the story just droned on. This book took me two months to read as it kept putting me to sleep."
1,It just went on and on and on....,"It just went on and on and on like a bad movie. I couldn't wait for this book to end. Endless details about unimportant matters, and barely a sentence about things that were extremely important.It reminded me of a very poorly written VC Andrews book."
1,Boring!,"I agree with most of the negative comments. This was hard to get through and I kept asking myself what in the world did other people see in this book?At least with my other negative reviews, I can see why some people were drawn to it. With this book, I can't imagine why anyone would."
2,Could've used a little editing,"The Memory Keeper's Daughter is based on a reasonable premise: the loss of a child and a husband's lie result in lifelong anger and damage to the marriage. This story could have been a good one if it had been tightened up. A Lot. About two thirds of the way through the book, David takes off to his abandoned childhood home, befriends and supports a pregnant teenager, and gives up his life's passion (photography). This is where the story falls apart and the characters become flat. They start to say inane things in order to move the plot along so the book can come to an end. It seems as if Edwards' editor must have gone on vacation and left the author to throw in every humdrum event she could think of."
3,"Interesting story, but not a quick read","Although the storyline was engaging, I found this book difficult to read at times. The Memory Keeper's Daughter was not a page-turner for me, yet I did enjoy reading it, and felt it worthwhile. The overall topic of how a single act can greatly impact the future was compelling; however, the writing was, at times, tedious to read."
1,Ditto GSK review,"Too much purple prose. Made it to page 100. Good premise, but too overwrought and depressing."
4,True to the time,"I found this book to be true to the times, where there were so many prejudice for people, especially children with disabilities in America. I appreciate how they didn't over play this or under play the issues and difficulties. This was a great read. Warning, once you hit the middle, you wouldn't put the book down."
5,Interesting and Thought Provoking,This book takes one through the far-reaching consequences of a single significant choice. It's worth reading.
2,Promising premise but........,"The summary on the back is very catchy - and I as very excited about reading this book. Unfortunately, the story misses the gripping element. I had such high expectations - and maybe that's why it felt like such a flop."
4,A Tragic Situation,"A father makes a decision that changes the courses of many lives in this novel. It starts in the 1960s, when things were vastly different from today in regards to child birth and children with special needs. David and Norah have twins, but David sacrifices one of them because she has Down syndrome. David & Norah's life is never the same, and the lives of their children are affected by his one decision. A moving book."
1,unrealistic even for a screenplay,I kept waiting for this to culminate. It had a great plot. The characters are ridiculous in many ways. They are undeserving superlatives. I had hoped for more. There are so many great writers that I have to forgive myself for reading as much as I did.
3,So-So,"This was an okay book. I read the whole thing, but it was pretty slow in some parts and that made it hard to get through. The beginning was really interestng then kind of pooped out."
2,not for me...,"My friend read this one and could not put it down. We usually have the same taste-not this time! I had to make myself finish it and kept waiting to be interested. I have heard may people saying how wonderful it was, but not for me!"
3,A Novel About Loss,"Kim Edwards creates a family that just doesn't connect, primarily because David holds a dark secret that creates a divide between his wife and himself, and his son and himself. At birth, he gives away his daughter, who has Down Syndrome, it is a moment that he can never retrieve, nor forget.He is not a monster, however, and we are made to see that the woman who raises his daughter probably is better equipped to love and truly care for her. Sometimes family fails us, and depending on the kindness of strangers works out for the best.Besides being a good novel, with many twists and turns of plot, this book also gives us a good perspective on how Down Syndrome was regarded and treated in the 1960's, and how far we have come since then."
2,Just okay,"When I read the back of the book, I thought that I was in for a good read. However, once I started to read it, it became boring, due to the fact the author spent a lot of time detailing things that didn't need to be. Overall it was pretty good, but I would be skeptical to buy another book written by this author."
1,Search for a Timeline,"A timeline of the book's (few) events would be far more interesting than reading the book itself - so long as it wasn't written in the same writing style that Edwards uses! The premise of the book is wonderfully intriguing and fairly unique, but to me the way that it was written sucked the book dry. My advice: read the first 10 pages before you buy the book and if you're annoyed by the writing style, don't buy it. Trust me. It won't get any better, so there's no need to put yourself through the same torture the rest of us did. Look for a synopsis instead!"
4,Treat People with Disabilities Like...People,"Kim Edwards did a wonderful job of showing us how many people's lives are affected by one impulsive, destructive decision. As a mother I cannot fathom how a parent can give a child away, for any reason. As a counselor who works with people with disabilities I still observe the discrimination that people with disabilities suffer; I'm sure in 1964 it was even worse. Ms. Edwards did leave me wanting to know more about Phoebe and Paul and their futures."
3,A complex and uplifting story,"I loved the book and I am so delighted it was made into a movie. The premise of a father spiriting away a newborn unbeknowst to his wife, is powerful. The reverberations of his actions throughout their lives was extremely well-handled. But the thing that stood out in this book more than anything for me was the treatment of the question - Is Down Syndrome something to be unhappy about? Without giving anything away, I want to say that I loved the answer to this question. The author is extremely gifted and I applaud her handling of an extremely complex and uplifting story.Wendy Dolber, author, The Guru Next Door, a Teacher's Legacy.The Guru Next Door"
2,booooring,"The book was extremly boring and a sample how a good plot can be wasted in overwordy meaningless details. Some characters introduced with no clue for what purpose (for instance Al). It was tough for me to finish, and I love to read!"
4,"Beautiful, Sometimes Heartbreaking, Longer Than Necessary","I loved Edwards's prose, the way she described details as though we were looking through the camera from which this story gets its name. It's a wonderful study about the decisions that we make, and make for others, and how they alter life's course. My only complaint, the reason it gets four not five stars, is that the story could have ended much sooner. The ending wasn't really satisfying because it took so long to get there and the real story was tied up long before. But that's a minor point. I loved Edwards's writing voice and if you love stories that delve deep into the characters' lives, you'll love this.Cindy ThomsonAuthor of Brigid of IrelandBrigid of Ireland: A Historical Novel"
4,Enjoyed it,"I'm confused by the multiple reviews that describe this book as being soap-opera-esque. Maybe I missed something, but if anything the plot tended toward the slow, philosophical side. Aside from the initial giving away of baby Phoebe (which, given the time, wouldn't have been so far-fetched), there were no real 'dramatic twists'. The story is just a look at the ordinary lives of the six people involved. A bit slow, but overall I recommend it."
2,Very disappointed,"After reading the plot, this book seemed to be a prefect fit for me, however as previous reviews it really goes way of track. The book really has nothing to do with the first two chapters. The character's do nmot have depth, or strength. The author's descriptive writing is unable to hold my attention. It was truly a strugle to finish this book."
2,"Depressing, Long","I held out to the end and kept reading this agonizing, depressing story thinking the last pages might give me some final gratification...but to no avail. It was a lot of tedious detail and character description - not a whole lot of plot.I did not identify with the characters and thought they were miserable. I was hoping to find out more about Phoebe's life as a child and adult with Down's and try to feel life in her shoes, but there wasn't much written about her.I mainly stuck with it for the book club I'm in - the book left me with nothing - I felt no emotion for the characters either - it was a waste of my time - 3-4 hours I'll never get back!"
2,Not all its cracked up to be,I read this for a book club. We had all heard over and over again that it was a great book.. until we read it. Everyone came to the same conclusion. It was slow going at some points and some major parts of the plot seemed to be just skipped over.
3,A frustrating page-turner,"I liked this book, but there always seemed to be something missing. The lead character's life was miserable because he lied to his wife about the birth/death of their mentally challenged child - and his and his family's lives never grew because of it. I found it a frustrating story of unrealized and unspoken love; of opportunities lost and leaps of faith not taken. I kept reading, thinking I knew for sure what would happen in the end, but was disappointed."
3,Great Writing but ...,"The writing is beautiful and I love how she weaves in the art of photography into the plot. I started reading with much anticipation and couldn't out the book down in the beginning. But somewhere down the line I began to lose interest and found myself skipping paragraphs only to find that i didn't really miss much. I didn't find myself liking any of the characters, especially Nora. The author started out characters like Bree and Al as if they would have a greater role, but in the end, the story would have been the same even if they weren't there. Seems like the author couldn't figure out how to end the novel. But negative comments aside, the writing is really lush and flows like music. Maybe that's where the hype is from - the writing!"
2,Ridiculous,"First off, I absolutely hate this book. The first chapter was what got me to buy it initially, and I have to say that it was very well-written. The subsequent chapters, however, were horrid. Even though I had no wish to continue reading it halfway through, I pressed on, thinking that the story would pick up. It didn't. I can't even understand how this book could have ended up on The New York Times' bestseller list. It is beyond me even till now."
2,very disappointed with the ending,"I really enjoyed the beginning of this book. It reminded me of the John Updike ""Rabbit"" books which transported me back to several different time periods when people truly acted differently due entirely to the culture of the time. However Norah and Paul came across as very shallow at the end of the book with their simplistic embracing of Phoebee at the wedding after the first short awkward meeting. It felt too much like a fairy tale ending where everything is going to be wonderful now that the truth is out. I wonder how Norah would have actually handled raising a child with Down Syndrome as opposed to being handed a well adjusted adult to visit with. Same goes for Paul. I like Dr. David Henry the best. Like Harry, he had real human qualities which he struggled with."
1,A Waste...,"This novel was predictable, I had zero interest in the characters, and the writing was juvenile; I struggled to finish it. I would definitely not recommend this novel - what a waste of 400 pages."
1,Disappointing,"I picked this up after reading Michael Ondaatdje's Divisadero. What a shocking contrast of writing styles; one elegant and spare and this, prolix and unfocused.The plot concept has good potential but the characters and the development of the story needs a lot more work and editing. Others have gone over the weaknesses. I cannot recommend this.(Editors, where are you these days??)"
3,The Memory Keeper's Daughter,I can't believe that the author did thorough research on this topic without discovering that Phoebe was born with Down Syndrome not Down's Syndrome! I was corrected on the name first thing when my granddaughter was born.
3,Aggravating,"I just found this entire novel rather irritating. I liked it at first, but I just found Norah's unending grief aggravating and unbelievable. Yes, having a stillborn child is horrifying and scarring and no one would ever fully recover from it, but I didn't find the way it ate at the entire rest of her existence and basically ruined her life at all believable. I mean, she had a live child, too, at the same time. Possibly it was her husband's constant cover-up of the whole issue that was the real perpetuation of her grief, but I still didn't find it believable. Just aggravating."
2,Overwrought,"Between the some of the worst passages I've ever read (incredible to me, as the author is a college writing professor and should know not to bog down her writing with ""gee look how creative I can get with this metaphor"" passages), the poor grammar (""Norah speeded up"") and the continuous misuse of a term (It's Down Syndrome, not ""Down's"" Syndrome), this book was a struggle to read. The author crammed in passages about ""shafts of light"", ""quicksilver"", ""starfish hands,"" and ""cascades of (insert random something here)"" at every opportunity, and yet none of these things advanced the plot. I didn't connect with the characters either. One star for content, another for the basic idea used in the plot."
1,Beyond Disappointing,"Thank you, Amazon, for providing this forum for readers to express themselves and share their opinions. I reluctantly give this book a one-star rating only because the premise is intriguing and could have been developed into a good story. However, after having struggled through most of the book (50 agonizing pages remain to plow through), I kept thinking, ""Am I nuts? This is really terrible writing and yet it rec'd such good professional reviews."" Well, after reading the other negative reviews on Amazon, my faith in my reading taste has been reaffirmed. It is just plain awful, really. Just prior to reading this thing I had the pleasure of reading a Michael Cunningham novel---now there's an author with major talent. Perhaps the contrast made this an especially difficult book to stomach. So, thank you one-star-giving Amazon readers. I don't feel so alone. Now I'll force myself to complete those 50 pages. Maybe a glass (or three) of wine will help, really!"
3,"Good story, poor writing","The Memory Keeper's Daughter is a beautiful story, but what's often lacking is the writing. On many occasions I found myself rolling my eyes at the improbable and often forced dialog; many responses seemed non sequitur and only there for the purpose of redirecting the scene.Some of the scenes just seem to lack descriptive text, which makes some aspects of the conversation seem entirely out of the blue -- such as when Norah asks Henry, ""What's happening to us?"" during what would likely seem to many people as an ordinary marital argument without the context that it's out of the ordinary for this couple. Other passages seem saturated down with unnecessary scene-setting, which may seem more appropriate with a different approach.Also, a lot of the symbolism seems obvious, such as the constant recurrence of daffodils to illustrate the invisible bonds among the characters.The book is an interesting read, but Kim Edwards' writing has some growing up to do -- and I'm sure it will."
3,Memory Keeper's Daughter,"The book was in great condition. The item was not sent right away. I did notify seller when it did not arrive in its estimated arrival timeframe. Seller did ship it after recieving the e-mail, therefore it did arrive late."
3,Heartbreaking,"This story will tear your heart out to the very depth of your soul. The doctor delivered his own twins and sent one away because of a serious birth defect. Then he lied to his wife, telling her the baby died. The unthinkable decision he made in haste destroyed a beautiful marriage. The moral of the story; No good comes from lies and deceit, even when you think they are protecting your loved ones from trials and tribulation.Marty WurtzAuthor of Deceptions and Betrayals"
1,I did not like this book,The book was about 300 pages too long. We picked it for our book club and we all agree that this was our least favorite book.
1,Very disappointing,"Reading the back of this book, I thought it would be interesting and thought provoking. Instead, I found it to be very boring and wordy. Getting through this book was a chore. I kept thinking it would get better, but instead it just got worse."
3,Wordy,"A trusted reading friend of mine liked this book so I tried - I really tried - to like it, but could not and will not recommend it.I agree with all of the other 3-star reviews. I never could warm up to David. Actually, I didn't like him at all. The plot began to plod soon after the opening scenario of twins (how they were unknown to Norah in the early 60's is also questionable) being delivered in a snowstorm by doctor/daddy to his wife! Too many hokey aspects of the story that were burdensome and unnecessary, among which were David's secret real last name. Huh?"
4,Very well- written novel,"This is a very well- written novel. There is a clarity to the prose and a real suspense and drama in the story. There are situations and characters that are moving also. One technical point bothered me. The novel proceeds by telling in parallel the story of the two families, the one of David Henry, his wife and their son- the second of the nurse, Caroline, who is raising the Mongoloid twin daughter David Henry did not want to keep. At a certain point I simply found the story of Caroline far more interesting. The whole situation created by the 'lie and deception' of David Henry the uneasy relation with his wife perhaps is given in too much detail.On the whole though this is a highly readable and extremely well- written work."
2,Highly implausible,"While the premise of the story seems fascinating, the content is just too shallow for me. This novel would be better as a pulp paperback, and is far from ""literature"". The characters are interesting, and most of us can relate to many of them. But the choices they make, and the dialog connecting them, felt contrived and cliche'. I really wanted to like this book. I didn't."
3,Ending doesn't measure up to the beginning...,"The concept of this book fascinated me, so during a long layover at Chicago's Midway airport I picked up a copy and started reading. The beginning sucked me in and kept my interest the whole way home. Kim Edward's depiction of the towns involved were so vivid, and so close to my heart (I've lived in both Kentucky and Pittsburgh, PA). The opening is so emotionally charged, that the reader really feels everything happening the charachters. Then, a little more than halfway through, the charachters lose their depth and become the ""cardboard cutouts"" that another reviewer described. After the climax of the novel, I was really left shaking my head. How is it that these characters that were so full of color and detail have lost it all by the time the great revelation is made?Still a good read, but the end just seems a little rushed."
2,Loses steam quickly,"This was a book club book for me. One of our members has a son with Down Syndrome and thought it would be an insightful read. It wasn't. The book started out compelling enough, but quickly became redundant, trite and cliche. I agree with previous reviews that character development was poor. There was also a point in the book, around page 300 where the author used the word 'thin' to describe her sister about ten times in the space of a few pages. I think Edwards got tired of her book as well."
3,Disappointed,"I was hopong this would be another book like ""I Know This Much Is True"" by Wally Lamb. I did not want that book to be over. This one I could not wait for it to be over.It is not as if this writer has no talent. She certainly does, albeit she is a professor. It appeared to me as if she were writing several short stories and tying them together instead of having one grand story that flowed on and on. Each section of the book took too much space describing landscaping, houses, clothing,etc. It was as if the story itself was not enough. In fact, the story took second place to the surroundngs. The story of the characterts' lives and their emotions should have filled a long novel. Unfortunately, we really didn't know that much about the characters, or at least it seemed so to me. But who I am to criticize? I took engineering in college and never wrote anything longer than a technical report."
1,Trite and long-winded!,"If you like stories where One Big Secret implausibly permeates all activities, and the prose rates about a B-minus in a creative writing workshop, buy this book."
1,Condition of Book,"I haven't read it yet but that isn't the issue here. I purchased this book for my daughter-in-law for a stocking stuffer and I was really quite disappointed in the condition. It is yellowed, sticky stuff on top of the front cover, tear in the spine, and small tears on top of front cover. This book hardly look new. The reason I purchased from this seller is because it was honored by Amazon."
2,"LONG- - -SO VERY, VERY LONG!!!","After about 1/4 of the book I could not believe the slowness.I had stopped the last 2 or 3 books I started, , ,so, , ,I made myselfpush on. UUUGGGHHH!!! It was a struggle to finish. S-L-O-W!!!I had about 50 pages left, , , ,I had to stop twice. No barn-burner here."
2,booooring,this book took me so long to get through because nothing exciting ever happened.. i don't understand what all the hype is about! spare yourself and read something by jodi picoult instead!
3,fair,"i have a few hang ups THESE MAY BE CONSIDERED SPOILER ALERTS:1. Norah becoming an alcoholic and permiscuous was a complete cop-out2. allowing the doc to die let him completely off the hookIt appears everyone was falling apart in the book over this fateful decision that doc made except for the daughter herself...the story seem to allude to the fact that when her birth mother and brother came onto the scene, it didn't really affect her life much, she was the only happy functional character, go figure."
2,Put it down 2/3 of the way through,"... and I have yet to pick it back up. The beginning of the book is compelling and a fast read. But as the characters began to age, the story lost my interest. The level of emotion dropped, and it became about the common, day-to-day business of living. ""And then she did this.. and then she did that... And then he did this. And she felt bad about that."""
3,Not a huge fan of this book,"While the plot was interesting, it was preposterous at times. I was compelled to keep reading but skipped paragraph upon paragraph of descriptive writing. I guess I prefer a more concise writing style. Another reviewer said ""blah, blah, blah"" and that's what I felt too -- get on with it."
3,Needed Better Editing,"The word ""soft"" or some variant of it is used at least once a page. The author bangs us over the head with comments like ""this being 1964..."" ""this being 1970..."" And what about Bree ""collecting faxes"" in 1982? The book could have been half as long, had more character development--expecially Phoebe--and been infinitely better. I slogged through it, but it was an ordeal!"
1,Memory Keeper Needs some editing,"I thought the book could have been written in half as many pages. There was a complete section that the editor overlooked, somewhere 1/3 into the book. If I read the metaphor about hands looking like starfish one more time I thought I'd choke. It's okay once but it was overused. Too many tangents that slowed the book down. I kept skimming to get to the storyline instead of all the inconsequential drifts in thought. Sure it's an interesting idea for a story but not enough to make into a book. I'm surprised it's a bestseller."
2,Very frustrating...made me angry!,"The premise of this book was fascinating but I was terribly disappointed by the story. Dr David Henry is faced with a terrible decision in the 1960's and made a choice based on the best information available to him at the time. At the time of the birth of the twins, his wife was needy and dependent. Nothing about her inspired confidence in her ability to handle a tough situation. He was in love with his wife and was faithful to her, loved and cherished his son and worked his tail off to support them and provide them with a plush lifestyle. Yet, he was made to be the villain of the book. His wife cheated on him. His son never appreciated the sacrifices his father made for him. I wanted to shake both of them....they were unbearably selfish! This was a total waste of a great idea....it doesn't deliver...don't waste your time! And just in case you think this review was written by a bitter husband and father....I'm a happily married wife and mother!"
1,Boring,"Big disappointment....I wanted to kick these character into some action. I never really got any ""feel"" for them, and basically found the book dreadfully boring."
2,Disappointing,"From reading the story synopsis on the back, I thought this book had a lot of promise. The story idea/plot was a great idea but felt the story didn't develop well. Pretty boring to be quite honest. I also was surprised to see the author use the same similies over and over again to convey images, such as the baby's hand like a starfish.....3 times....come on already."
2,Don't Bother,Okay- I read this book because it kept popping up everywhere under bestsellers and all of the recommended lists BUT it was so hard to finish and the only reason that I did was because my Book Club chose it. You keep thinking that something big is going to happen but it really never does and the whole book is just pretty painful to read- I suggest you move on and read something else.
3,Stop reading reviews and read the book!,"I recommend reading this book before you read all of the reviews and comments from other readers. Unfortunately, someone revealed the entire plot line to me before I started reading, and I think I enjoyed the book less because of it.This book is NOT in the same vein as Jodi Picoult and other writers who create suspense and powerful twists at the end, so skip it if you are looking for that. At times, The Memory Keeper's Daughter is slow moving and predictable, but still the message is powerful and effective. The story examines how one single, spur-of-the-moment decision affects the lives of so many people. Everything that happens in the book happens because of the decision one man makes on one snowy evening.What made an impact on me, though, was not just how their lives changed, but also how the decision changed who they were. Edwards captures the emotional states of the characters very well. If you enjoy depth of character, this novel is for you."
2,STARTED OUT GOOD.. BORING..,The first few pages are good and i thought to myself i will enjoy this book however it keeps going on and on and on and on.. and we get it.. the father screwed up he has guilt.. blah blah blah. Then within one chapter it ends. Boring....
5,The most beaurtiful book I've read.,"I saw this book out of the corner of my eye, and I really am into mystery, murder who done it kinds of books. My book has now gone through 3 other people, and they have all be blown away by the story. Set in the 60's, it's so amazing how times have changed. I loved this book, and would recommend anyone who has a child, as well as a child with any disability to get this book. I can't express how lovely and beaurifully written this was. I became captivated with thst story, and couldn't put this book down. If you get it, you won't be disappointed! I promise!Kari"
3,Interesting story; laborious to read,It was a task for me to read this book. The only thing that kept me going was that the story was interesting. I felt that it was a labor to read this story. The writer bogged the story down with uninteresting details and her attempts to develop stories within a story were complete failures.
4,Great Book!,"This story line sounded realy intriguing. I'm glad that I read it, because I really enjoyed the book. The writing was great and the story was believable, especially since it initially started in the early 60s. I didn't like David, but I pitied him, which helped me stay engaged. Try the book, I think you'll like it!"
4,It Will Break Your Heart,"Kim Edwards' novel is thought-provoking and very sad. True, she gets a little bogged down by unnecessary datails, but the characters are well-developed and the story is strong. I had strong feelings for each character - anguish for Phoebe, given away by her own father, unwanted, ignored, looked over, sadness for David, who justified his action by rationalizing that it would protect the rest of his family and hurt for Paul, who suffered.The ending did not hold as much resolve for me as I had hoped. Rather, it left many characters in an ambiguous state, focusing entirely on the budding relationship between Paul and Phoebe. I am still wondering what happens to Norah - will she ever have a relationship with her own daughter? What about Caroline? Does she ever comletely allow Phoebe to break away and have her own life?This is an interesting story. It truly makes you think about life - its worth, and who deserves it."
4,Expect the Unexpected,"The Memory Keepers Daughter was a good read...my first of this author, and would be interested in reading her in the future.This storyline, the idea of this happening, a child being given away by one parent unbeknowst to the other....and how the author dealt with it, reconciled it, was interesting. To see how they each lived their lives afterwards, how they were affected, how others were affected. It wasn't exactly what you might expect in some ways, but also had the readers interests in mind and what kind of conclusion we might be looking for and delivered some of that as well.Over-all I enjoyed this eerie book. It was a good read and definitely kept me up at night wondering what would happen next!"
4,A Great Story,"This is an amazingly complex story of three people's lives who are linked together by a life altering event. The characters are rich, deep and profound and their stories are heartbreaking, yet understandable. You will enjoy this story and yet be sorry for the characters. Well written."
4,"A Promising Premise, Poorly Executed","This book started out with a promising concept--a doctor who delivers his own children--twins--on a stormy night and pretends one has died because she has Down Syndrome and he does not want to bring her home to his wife. He is afraid she will really die and he is haunted by memories of his own little sister's death and the impact on him when he was growing up. Instead, he instructs his nurse to take the baby to a children's home; but the nurse adopts the baby herself.However, the plot goes downhill from there. The book moves slowly and, in my opinion, is tedious. I won't give away the plot but I will say it was very disappointing and mediocre. The writing wasn't especially gripping, although it got the job done. The book was fair but not what I had expected."
4,Medical Thoughts on Memory Keeper...,"The medical admonition ""above all do no harm"" was at the heart of the tragic elements of this book. David had violated a prime part of his professional honor. The act of giving away his disordered infant destroyed his marriage and injured most of his otherrelationships.Despite his efforts to redeem himself he never was able to face up and tell the truth.There are lots real life stories like this, some equally sad, and it is hard to make them end happily. Kim Edwards did a pretty good job. pmc"
2,Long... and Tedious,"Overall, I really did not enjoy this book. It was so beautifully written in it's use of language to paint the stage of the book. But the story itself, was was too long and tedious for the it to be enjoyable. Every character in the book annoyed me and made me want to scream at them that they were so stupid. One may argue that the characters did what could only have been done, but no. I don't believe that. There is not time but the present for forgiveness."
3,Disappointing,This story is full of disappointment and disdain for the father. Not very realistic and I found my self instantly disliking most of the characters which made it difficult to get through the remaining of the book. I just found myself not really caring what the outcome was.
2,"Dull, depressing, drawn out book!","So, this book started out quite interesting and for about the first 60 pages or so I could not put it down. After that.... dull, depressing, and dragged on and on. The characters mainly just went on and on about their difficult lives and difficult decisions for 340 pages. I kept waiting for this book to get good, and then I kept just waiting for it to finish. I spoke to 2 people who also read this book and they also told me that they did not like it, but I was determined to enjoy it since the beginning was so captivating. All in all, it was an interesting concept for the novel, but proved to be nothing more than ""ugh, it is finished yet?""."
2,Contrived and Depressing,"I really wanted to like this book. Waited several weeks for it on the library wait list. The characters are too one dimensional, the storyline contrived and the pace agonizingly slow. Good title, though."
3,"Okay, but could have been better","This book felt like one long run-on sentence. I enjoyed the characters, and also the world that Edwards creates in this novel. She uses devices that entice us to think with each of our senses, meticulously describing the sights, sounds, smells, textures, etc. Perhaps I wouldn't have skimmed though as much of the book as I did has Edwards NOT been so overly descriptive of every speck of dust. By the climax, I was tired and worn out from the long, drawn-out (often repiticious) paragraphs. The idea of this novel is beautiful, but there's something pompous and ultimately boring in being overly eloquent about the way the leaves blow in the wind and how that reminds a character of loss and blah blah blah blah. Perhaps this book is just too melodramatic for my tastes."
5,Mesmerizing,"What a well written, tension-filled book! The characters are believable and human. The plot turns on one horrific decision made by a young doctor/husband. The force of this decision affects many thruout their lives.The narrative is flowing and the dialogue well done. I recommend this book to thoughtful readers."
2,"Okay, I'm almost 1/2 way thru this book and realized ...","it ain't gonna get better.WHEN does Norah find out what David did?Geesh!I just can't spend anymore time on all the frivolous jabbering between the beginning of the story and the END. Nothing is happening. Okay, okay, I understand David had a sister who died young, and he wants to spare Norah that pain, .. but WHEN DOES THE SHTF in this book?The kids are already SIX YEARS OLD, and David & Norah are not getting along (altho' the reasons are subtle, I UNDERSTAND why), but, besides baby Phoebe, nothing else earth-shattering has happened. There's not enuf character development for my liking, especially of the heroic Caroline.And I keep falling asleep.I'm done!I'll give the author two stars for the effort.The premise of the books is compelling, but not the way it is written."
4,Almost perfect story,"This book was almost perfect. I waited a long time to read this book because I thought it would be a downer. Rather, this book is most uplifting and educational. I do not know any Downs syndrome children. I learned a great deal in this charming novel. The plot development was exceptional and the character development was first rate. I did not want this book to end. You really are introduced to some imperfect, but genuine people."
3,"Not a bad read, not a great read either.","This book is one of those that I read, wanted to read to the end, but wasn't over impressed one way or the other. I couldn't really decide how I felt about the characters, if I liked them or not. I felt wishy-washy right to the end about everyone. The only point that I thought was fascinating is how this doctor went to so much trouble to avoid pain and heartache and he walked right into more than he could have imagined. Such a horrible lesson to learn in such a horrible way. I guess that lesson redeemed the book in my eyes a bit, but the fact that the author didn't seem to get me to like or dislike anyone really brings me back to my three star rating. It's OK. That's all I can say."
3,"Good, but not great","Being in a field that treats children with developmental disabilities, I was interested in this book. So, I began asking around about it. Nothing but rave reviews...so I asked for it for Christmas. Loved the beginning and couldn't put it down. Then the middle came and I kept wondering how she was going to end it. It dragged a bit and I wasn't that fond of the end of the story (which I won't share....). The greatest characters for me were Caroline and David Henry for carrying the secret they had for so long. Caroline was a hero who made the right choice in a rushed choice by Dr. Henry. I would suggest this as a good read, but not a great read as people are claiming."
3,"Good Read, Not Great","My bookclub just picked this book. A few of them thought it was a wonderful read. I can't really put my finger on it, but it left me feeling like something was missing. It seemed like the author was going somewhere with the main character and then forgot her point. That said, I did appreciate the way the author described Caroline's struggles and joys in raising a child with a developmental disability. To think that just 25 - 30 years ago our education system was closed to such children makes me thankful for how it is now. I have a 10yr old who is DD and the thought of someone telling me that he isn't teachable enough to go to school just brings tears to my eyes. So for that reminder, I am thankful for having read this book."
2,"A good story, told all wrong.","Kim Edwards had a good story to tell, but knowing the ""secret"" after the first few chapters made the rest of the book seem like a long, dull slog. The only suspense was having other characters find out what the reader already knows. Not good enough. There was some good character development, but ""Nora"" was hard to sympathize with even though she had suffered a great loss. Kim Edwards somehow expects the reader to understand how losing a child at birth is a good excuse for peeling off your clothes the first time a man other than your devoted husband makes eye contact. Apparently, it's then okay to turn into a self-absorbed, money chasing, serial adulteress. But we're supposed to hate the husband because he made a terrible decision under pressure that he regretted and tried almost immediately to correct? Please."
2,Disappointingly Dull,"It was with great anticipation that I began reading this story. Afterall, Sue Monk Kidd (one of my favorite authors) had quite a complimentary quote on the book's cover. Mama always said, ""Don't judge a book by its cover"" and she was right!There were several characters in this story, yet there was no one to identify with, to feel empathy for, or to even care about! Poor Phoebe was so one-dimensional, she elicited no emotion from this reader at all. She was described as having a ""bowl cut"" to illustrate that yes, she has Down's Syndrome and no, these individuals are not entitled to have flowing hair...Trite and boring, I would have rather been doing laundry than reading this book. However, I kept turning the pages and hoping for something (ANYTHING) to happen. Nothing ever did."
1,Hard to believe it is a bestseller.,"Horrible. Sophmoric. Could not force myself to read any more than a few chapters. The writing is pathetic, characterization is nonexistent. A good idea gone bad. If I could give zero stars, I would."
2,great concept...fails to a troubling finish,"Ms. Edwards has created characters that are not very realistic. I found it difficult to relate to the motives of any of these characters. David was certainly not anyone I've ever run across.His character was totally unbeleivable. Ms. Edwards needs to talk to more men. The passages relating to his photography were boring. Who cares???? I didn't egt the connection she was trying so desperately to make between David's passion for photography and his ""losses"".I had a hard time believing that Norah was suffering so VERY much yet since the death of her daughetr at birth, that when she finally meets her...she takes off to France w/ her new husband. Oh well..guess it's too late to have a relationship with my daughter whom I thought dead..which led to the destruction of every other relationship in my life. Ya, sure........ Not very beleivable."
1,Forced reading !! Move along ..........,"We read this for a book club selection. Well, it was all I could do to finish it because I like to be in on the discussion , but it seems everyone in the book club felt the same. When I read fiction I like to connect with at least one character in the book, but found no connection with any. Flat, uninteresting......... blah !!!"
2,Wish I had borrowed it from the library...,"I'm still puzzled about the hype this book has gotten. The story is contrived and offers no surprises. The author tends to write down to her reader, and repeats details overtly, rather than showing the story in prose."
3,Disappointed,"I was disappointed by this book. You know the premise by now. The entire point of the novel is to explore how this one decision, made quickly while exhausted and under great emotional strain, reverberates throughout the lives of the various characters affected by it. The author repeatedly tells us that the decision changed everything and came between dad and son, and between husband and wife. However, she never explains exactly how, and worse, never shows us how. It's the classic novice-writer blunder: telling us rather than showing us."
2,Starts off good,"Like others, I found the first 150 pages enjoyable. The next 250 pages are tedious, as the story is predictable and longwinded. Kim Edwards does a good job of introducing characters into the novel...there is no need to spend 200 pages explicitely detailing their motives when it was understood in the first 1/2 of the book."
2,"A Long, Depressing Journey","When our book club selected this novel, I was enthusiastic ~ the premise appeared to leave so much room for the development of great characters and a great story. However, after the first chapter or so, I kept waiting for the big ""wow"" factor...and it never came. I found most of the characters unsympathetic and not very well-developed. Like other readers, I finished it out of obligation, but never gleaned any enjoyment from reading it."
2,"Not a ""keeper"" for me","Well written book about the secret birth of a Down Syndrome child, but a ""downer"" for me. Even though it is now on the best seller list, I can't imagine how this book reached such popularity.I thought many of the scenarios were not only improbable, they were downright ""corny"". I wondered if this story would ever end, and was relieved when it finally did."
2,Keep your memories to yourself,"The book takes place in a world where small problems become big problems, and big problems become insurmountable. It was very annoying for me to watch all the characters dig themselves deeper when it didn't take a brain surgeon (even though one of the characters was a Doctor) to figure out how they can pull themselves out of the mess and move on with their lives."
1,Boring,I don't think this book lives up to the hype. I thought the first half was interesting but fizzled out somewhere in the middle. My gut reaction was to stop reading half way through but I thought it might get better. It never did. None of the characters are ever happy. Never. After about 75% it was just plain depressing. I would suggest picking up something else...
1,bemoan the world of dreary.....,"Absolutely the worst book that came into my hands in years. Dreary tale full of holes, the author used little common sense in her writing. The only intriguing part of the book is its title, everything else falls into the abyss of poor language skills. We'd all be unhappy to wake up and find these characters living next door, no redeeming qualities."
2,"Okay, not great","I was like many others on here- I thought it would be a great read when I bought it. I could not wait! However, I did not read the reviews on here before buying. I liked the book in some ways because of the timeline and how the families changed, but they did sort of seem to stay the same too. The only significant changes were the children growing up. In real life, all of the characters would have changed significantly. I really thought this book would focus on the daughter, hence the name of the book and the story behind it. However, I do not feel she really was a significant character in this book at all. She was just sort of in the background of it all in a way. I am a rehabilitation counselor, so I really was looking forward to this story. I was a bit disappointed because the daughter was not really a key player in this novel. I would not recommend this as a must read, but okay to pass the time if you just want to read something."
1,Like a bad dream,"The first chapter was good and it was all downhill from there. Parts of the book were like a bad dream where nothing makes sense, nothing fits and you wake up trying to figure out what the heck you ate the night before."
2,One dimensional treatment,"Well the book is uneven and the characters unappealing (save one), but that's not my complaint.I was annoyed by the one-dimensional treatment of the daughter character who has Down Syndrome. It only reinforces stereotype, showing people with this syndrome as being a collection of characteristics (smiley, sweet, childlike) but otherwise lacking individuality or personality. For contrast, read The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time by Mark Haddon. You will understand and appreciate the inner life of the character with autism and feel you know him as a person, not a type."
2,Good but dragged a bit,"I enjoyed this book for the most part, but also felt that it dragged on a good bit. The woman in the book experiences the same emotion all throughout, and it could be that I've never lost a child as it was born, but this story let it pretty much ruin her life. And that got old after a while. Also, the author gives the reader too many feelings and not enough facts. It was just a bit drawn out. Could have been a MUCH better story. It has that potential."
3,Mesmerizing Start; Slow Finish,"This book grabbed my attention from the first page. Couldn't wait to pick it up and read more about how Dr. Henry's agonizing decision went on to affect so many lives in such different ways. However, the last quarter of the book hits a bump in the road and almost seems to belong to another story. Dr. Henry's encounter with Rosemary, and the subsequent behaviors that follow, just didn't seem to ring true to the character's development. It bogs the book down after that point. Other than that portion of the book, it's a great read with a satisfying ending."
3,Too predictable,I can see why this was made into a movie on the Lifetime Network. Very chick flicky and very predictable.
3,A book written by a woman to women (and maybe guys too),"It was based on a similar concept of ""Namesake"", another contemporary book written by a woman, ie, that men has something terrible to hide from their spouses. :-) For guys it may be hard to relate to the characters, but even so I recommend it. Mainly because the book is fairly well written. I almost never read romantesque novels, so at least it was stimulating for me on this level. The characters are after all vivid and I could fell their pain (even if I did not buy into the premise). It is an okay book. I thought it would deserve more than a Lifetime movie, but it is all it got..."
3,Tedious Disappointing Read,"Many reviews here mimic my own feelings for this book. I thought the summary of the book was very appealing, but the actual story was a disappointment. It started of well enough and drew me in, but after the first 20 pages or so the details became overwhelming and unnecessary. The novel dragged on like an exhausting soap opera where the characters get ever so close to resolving their problems, but never actually do. At the other extreme, the end felt rushed and imposed."
1,DON'T DO IT!!!!,"This was one of THE DUMBEST, MOST BORING books I have ever read. Like a butthead, I looked at the cover and thought 'what a great looking book'. There is WAY too much info, it ended really stupid....not at all like I'd hope it would go....I loved the beginning....it could have gone into sinister ways, anything would have been better than the RIDICULOUS way the author chose to end it."
2,"by turns - implausible, silly & overwrought","multifaceted implausible setup, predictable playout. even has the dark & stormy night. like watching a movie where someone walks into a basement, but doesn't turn the light on. oh, & the someone is someone you are never given any reason to care about."
3,Memorable,"Great for people who enjoy books with a John Irving-esque style to them. Enjoyable read...not really the type of book I would normally be drawn to, but fascinating none the less."
2,little more than a potboiler,"I'll be quite frank, since my thoughts on thsi book did not linger much. With a terrific and poignant beginning, the author manages to point out how a secret can subconsciously dissolve the lives of the people involved - and nothing more.She manages to insert some nice peices of family melodrama, but other than that, she depends too much on a singular point, and the great begining is followed by the usual pages and pages of wondering thoughts and ramblings. It eventually comes to a nice, bland conclusion, leaving the reader still stuck in the indecisive muck and wondering if the author should have had another climax besides the one in the first couple chapters."
1,Memory Keepers Daughter------argh!,"This is the worst book I've EVER read. A New York Times best seller? Oh please!I thought it might have some redeeming qualities and was hopeful especially after reading that the ""Memory Keeper"" had left his past behind, including changing his name. My father did the same and we didn't meet his family until he was 89!But NOOOO.....it was bad from beginning to end. Incredible waste of time!"
2,Highly overrated novel !,"While the book had some vivid imagery and occasional memorable descriptions, it was in desperate need of a good editor. There was way too much repetition, to the point of insulting the reader, as if we had to be reminded again and again of a particular event or character. If the book had been half as long, it might have been a much better novel. Don't waste your valuable time on this book; read something honest that respects you as a reader and will stay with you for many months (such as The Kite Runner) instead."
2,sorry I didn't like it,"I wanted to like this book, especially as I have a brother who is mentally handicapped, and I'm really interested in books that deal with that topic. However, I found the characters to be self-indulgent, whiny, weak and unappealing. The two exceptions are the truck driver - a lovely fellow - and the girl with Down's syndrome, who was depicted sympathetically and well.Perhaps part of the problem was that I read it after I read The Girls - a novel about conjoined twins who are anything but self-pitying. After their brave embrace of life, I had no tolerance for the Doctor with everything, who couldn't get past his childhood, and who was so incredibly emotionally crippled."
2,Hopeful in the beginning; disappointed in the end,"This sounded like a wonderfully intriguing book. While it was well written, it was poorly edited. There was much that could and should have been left out. The storyline with the Rosemary character served little purpose and the sudden death of one of the major characters was baffling. There were strong female characters and weaker male characters throughout the story...and this was so blatant that it took away from the story's believability. I enjoyed the first 100 pages or so and finished it because my book club was reading the book. Interestingly, the other members had the almost identical conclusion."
1,Life at Anne Geddes' House,"Each day I forced myself to pick it up and read another chapter, praying that my trust would be rewarded. Each day I was wrong. Ordinary life isn't ordinary. The conflicts we face are real and terrifying and joyous, and the author had so many things to choose from (too many to write well about, in fact) ; autism, twins, infidelity, the list goes on. The end result is what sounds like the ethereal rambling of a frustrated housewife with an empty nest. Save your money, read the synopsis."
1,I want a refund!,"It's a good thing I got this book as a gift, because it would have truly been a waste of money. Not only was it boring, but the characters were so bland and one dimensional that I imagined little cutout paper people walking around having this drivel dialogue. There was no mystery, no suspense, nothing...just an aimless wander through some really self-absorbed character's lives. I really tried to plow through it but completely lost my ability to care. My cat likes to lay on the book, he obviously gets more enjoyment out if it than I do!"
3,What a dreadful decision!,"Well written, a deep study in loss and what silences and lies can do to a couple. I didn't much care for the character of the wife/mother (Norah) who goes from helpless hare, through selfish , overworked , pleasure seeking ""bitch"" to saintly mother and ex wife.... very unlikely! To copy a very famous book it could be entitled ""David's choice"""
4,"Dramatic, highly readable","The concept of this book is pretty simple, but its the complexities of the lies that result from a solitary act that make it so engaging. I personally hated the father by the end of the book, and loathed most of the main characters, except the daughter herself. Our book club was divided on this one -- some people loved it, some people didn't care for it -- but everyone agreed the writing was excellent and that the author did a good job of weaving together a narrative driven by the suspense of human nature alone. I found it frustrating, and when one of the characters dies near the end, that felt too abrupt. But I thought about it long after I read it, which is something given that I read about six books a month and sometimes can't keep them straight!"
4,Good Book,"I enjoyed the story told in this book. There are parts taht are quite predictable, but the overall story telling is great."
2,what's all the hype about?,"As soon as I read this book, I knew it would be a best-seller.The controversial subject matter, and the quote from Sue MonkKidd(Secret Life of Bees), is just what sells these days. Tobe fair, the writing is pretty good, but the plot line is verycontrived and corny, to say the least. Without giving anythingaway, happy endings are not always the best choice."
1,Confused,I received three out of five books I ordered. I have no idea what happened to the Memory Keepers Daughter. I am trying to track this particular order to see if it was ever delivered.
2,What was the point,"Between the store hype and my friend's hype, I bought this book. I couldn't stand the main characters. The story was contrived. It did a very good job of presenting a person with Down's Syndrome and how to treat her. Other than that it was a wasted read."
5,Another Kite Runner,I could not put this book down and have not stopped thinking about it or telling people to read it since I finished reading it. I don't feel this way about many books since mostly I read for my book clubs. This would be a great book club book and hope when I suggest it they listen to me for a change.
1,Started off interesting but fell very flat.,"This novel started off with an interesting premise. After the first couple of chapters though it flatlined and it was a struggle to finish the book. The only reason was to find out the ramifications of that fateful decision. Well, it was very anti-climactic. The author took the easy way out and cheated the readers. And was it necessary to repeat over and over and over that the Dr. gave away his daughter? We got that from the beginning. It's beating a dead horse."
1,Screwed by Kindle,"I bought the paperback version but followed the link ""to start reading the book immediately on my Kindle"" and Amazon charged me again for the book even though the Kindle book is only readable on the Kindle and so can't be shared with a circle of friends. So be forewarned, if you want to read the book on Kindle, and keep it too, you will be buying the same book twice."
4,Good Intentions Gone Astray,"The story of a fraternal twin born mentally retarded and her father's decision to protect his wife from this knowledge forges an intricate tale of lies, deceit, heartbreak and triumph. He is forever controlled by guilt, his wife by sorrow and his son by loss. The nurse who makes her fateful decision to raise this girl as her own struggles with her own emotions and inner conflict, but finds joy and satisfaction in mothering this needy child. Some aspects of the story are a little far fectched, however, can be overlooked due to the well developed characters and plot. A good read overall."
3,"Really catches your attn, but I wasn't crazy about the ending","This book was a pretty good read, but not sure I would recommend it. I just really didn't care for the end. Since I used to work with mentally retarded - developmentally delayed people who were taken out of a group home, and into apartments to live on their own(with staff) I could relate to the girl in this book and the challenges that she faced. I have never read anything else by this author,but am willing to give it a try."
3,"Decent effort, could have been much, much better","Note: I'd really give this 2 and half stars, but that isn't an option.All in all, not horrible but not earth-shaking either. The premise of this story is the most interesting thing about it. Throughout the book, the author threw in a lot of ideas that she promptly dropped (the anti-war movement, the stirrings of feminism, etc.). Also, she uses the same phrases over and over again. I got tired of reading that a character felt like he/she had vertigo or that Norah felt David was so, so far away. The other annoyance is that the author tells us how horrible and desperate the characters feel, but I never fully buy it. She should have shown us more, rather than just repeat the same phrases hoping we'll get it.There were passages that moved me and plot threads that were compelling, but those just pointed to the unevenness of the work overall."
3,"Liked it, didn't Love it.","The story is unique but the characters were forgetable. Like a previous reviewer, I didn't see sufficient evidence to result in Paul's ultimate dislike of his father. For some reason, this really bothered me about the book.This is a good read but not a ""MUST"" read. For a point of reference, here are some of the books I consider ""MUST"" read: Time Traveler's Wife, The Girls, Snowflower and the Secret Fan."
2,""" WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY ""","NOW THIS STARTED OFF KEEPING MY INTEREST THEN, IT WAS LIKE READING SOME OTHER BOOK . THE AUTHOR DIDN'T SEEM TO KNOW WHAT THE HECK TO DO WITH THE CHARACTERS . SO WE haVE THE MOTHER GOING AROUND FOR YEARS WITH SOME SORT OF UNDEVELOPED "" SIXTH SENSE "" THAT SOMETHINGS NOT RIGHT ( DUH ) BUT, SHE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT IT IS ...SO WHAT DOES SHE DO ?

I must be losing my grip ."
2,Waste of time,"Characters were unsympathetic, writing was herky-jerky, and boring. I found myself skipping past the chapters regarding the Henry family, and reading only the chapters about Caroline, et al."
2,Disappointed,"This book was beautifully written but I didn't like the characters. Although I grew up in the 60's and 70's, I could not connect to the them and therefore found the book difficult to finish."
2,Slow read,"The author is a very good writer, however not my style at all. She is very poetic in her descriptions and overly too descriptive for my liking. If felt the story moved very slowly because of this. I felt annoyed by this which made reading this unenjoyable."
3,It dragged on and on and on,"The book immediately grabbed my attention in the opening chapter. I must admit that the first half of the book was gripping and I didn't want to put it down. The last half contained way too much rambling and anti-climatic scenes. I felt the subject matter had so much meat but the author kind of let it fall away. I kept wanting something more, some more drama and excitement. On the contrary, key scenes would come up out of nowhere and I'd wonder, ""what?"". I had to actually force myself to finish skipping over so much unneeded text and then it was hardly worth the effort. Sorry, I was hoping for so much more when I began the book but it sadly disappointed me."
2,"A ""precise"" disappointment","I was very excited to read this book and was very disappointed. The story had potential but there was too much detail and not enough dialogue. Her descriptions were dramatic and unrealistic. She used the words ""delicate and precise"" to describe everything, those words were used over and over to the point I wanted to scream....Toward the end of the book I skipped paragraphs, sometimes pages, of useless repetitive soap opera descriptions to try to get to the meat of the story. Bottom line, it was a waste of good reading time. You should read ""The Glass Castle"" now that is a GOOD book."
2,This book drove me crazy...,"First of all this book drove me crazy because the author consistently said Phoebe had Down's Syndrome instead of Down Syndrome. I have a son with Down Syndrome and in the past twelve years of living with this diagnosis, reading books, hearing professionals speak on the subject, and talking to other parents, it is always referred to as Down Syndrome not Down's Syndrome. But since I live in this world of Trisomy 21 I figured I would give the book a chance. I tried and kept at it for weeks. Reading it felt more like work than pleasure. The characters were shallow and I never felt connected to them. Although I disliked David in the beginning he became more likable as the story progressed. Probably because he had a little more to him than the others. The premise was great but the character development and story just fizzled and died. I was left feeling I didn't know who these people were even after I read 400 pages of them."
2,"overhype,as usual","Ron Charles review was better than the book! I could not relate or warm to any of these characters. I found the book boring ,frankly,through many passages. There was inconsistency(one place where the mom was referred to as ""old fashioned"",yet it was already brought out she'd had affairs,and drank..);but,bigger problem,just unlikable people,or worse I felt indifferent towards them-they were sterile. All those years,condensed,of course,for novel-size reading,but left me feeling let-down. there have been made-for-t.v. movies,etc..about Down's syndrome people marrying and all the parental concerns/conflicts..just another book about a bad marriage,'cause of a ""bad""white male,and doctor,to boot. but i didn't find the story stirring,tho' first pages were promising."
1,Not Memorable Not a Keeper,"This book has a great concept for a storyline, a good idea for a plot. Unfortunately, I found the writing so poor, I had to force my way through a lot of it. More like a romance novel than a literary one, it was sometimes hard to follow the flashbacks that jump around and are inserted in a clumsy way to provide background information. Dialogue was often unrealistic. The wife's anger at her husband and her degeneration into drunkenness was not portrayed realistically to me; I kept wondering ""Why?"" She didn't know what he had done, after all. There were a number of sophomoric stylistics, repetitions, and inconsistencies (it needed an editor!.) It would have been interesting to see this same story in the hands of a really good writer."
1,Had to force myself to finish it.....,"This book was a book club choice, so unfortunately all 700 times I wanted to put it down and never pick it up again I really couldn't. The characters were so boring and the descriptions went on and on. I actually believe there were about three pages devoted to a vaccume burning up. The story was a great idea, but the telling of it fell more than flat. I am not sure how it became a best seller...perhaps the pretty cover? I am an avid reader, and was extremely dissapointed with The Memory Keeper's Daughter."
2,Summer Drivel,"Yes, it began interestingly enough but was indeed too long with a sappy ending. And why was David the only parent Paul had difficulty with? How about finding his mom's clothes on the beach or knowing about her many other affairs? That might cause a child to wonder. It seemed like David and Rosemary were the most believeable characters in the book. Many holes in the story. Summer drivel, I guess, but it's hard to see how this is a bestseller."
2,A memory I'd like to forget,"My experience has been with the audio book. At about disc three (listening on a road trip) I couldn't decide whether counting the number of red cars that passed me would be more interesting than continuing to listen to the story. I give it two stars because the premise of the book is interesting. Beyond that, it's a disaster. I have never read a story where I could care less about the characters. They are flat, undeveloped, and unlikeable. I don't feel a shred of compassion for any of them. There is an excessive use of bad metaphors and excrutiating detail that oftentimes is irrelevant to creating a visual experience for the reader. It feels like the author tries too hard. I could say so much more, but I'm sure other reviewers have said enough!"
3,It was just all right for me (say it like Randy Jackson),"This was a book recommended by someone in our book club. It wasn't a bad book, really; but it lacked je-ne-sais-quoi. The recurring motifs (such hands like starfish and shoulders like wings) seemed pointless. There were several moral questions raised but unanswered."
3,I should have read the reviews,"Airport quickpick. The opening was a clincher, and I jumped into the story with both feet. However, the lengthy middle of the book dragged. The plot dripped slowly through two-score years of bad marriage/divorce/disfunctional families. The ending was satisfying, but I really wish I had read the reviews on this one and avoided it. I could have done better with my time."
2,Depressing,"I listened to the audio version of this book. I found certain issues to be annoyingly repetative throughout the book. Also, the fact that the main characters were so stuck and couldn't break out of it... more than once I wanted to scream, ""Get family couseling!""This book left me in the pits!"
4,Book was perfect for book clubs,"This book was chosen for my book club. I wasn't completely enthralled with it, but it did generate a lot of discussion. It seemed a little slow and I wanted to slap the woman many times and tell her to move on. I understood how and why the man acted the way he did. I also enjoyed the story of the nurse and her life, but the mother's character I never could relate to. She had a baby die. I can't imagine that kind of loss, but I felt like it was over done. Her affairs and her drama made her an unlikeable person. I like books that I can identify with the characters, and even though I didn't with the woman, I did enjoy the book and the reactions of my book club."
2,A disappointment,"The first half of this book was fairly engaging, but it went downhill quickly after that. I felt like the writer was conveying what she's learned in school about marital dysfunction and deterioration, rather than something she'd learned through experience. The writing was over-wrought. In fact, the last 20% of the book, the writer seemed to lose interest in the story and instead focused on trying to word impressions and scenes in a pretty and striking way. This was very irritating and I really struggled to finish the book."
2,More Prose Than Plot,"I love the creative use of words and poetic phrases in a novel when used to to propel the story. This author seemed to love her own creative wording for their own sake, more than for moving the story along. Shortly into this book I actually tired of the use of all the lovely phrases that just dragged the story to a slower and slower pace as each page when by. I kept with if for about 1/4 the way into the book, giving it that long to develop a plot line that would hook me in, but it just didn't come about yet, and I put it down. I have not been compelled to pick it up again."
3,Merely OK,"I thought that this book looked and sounded like one that I wouldn't be able to put down. For the first few chapters, I was very interested in it. After that, it became difficult for me to read. Not because I couldn't understand it or because it was poorly written, but because it was boring and a little predictable. It wasn't the worst book that I've read in recent months, but it was far from being the best. I'm not likely to purchase another of Kim Edwards' books in the future."
2,Painfully Slow,"This book had so much promise, but it seems the author got lost in the same blizzard the night that David Henry delievered his twins. Lack of character development, too many descriptions (every. single. detail. must. be. included.) and a disappointing ending contributed to a boring, misguided novel. One star for the cover and one star for the ability to fool so many people into buying this book."
2,Definitely Disappointing,"The first half of the book was interesting enough. The story was page turning, leaving the reader wondering how this was going to turn out and appreciating the writing style of the author. About 2/3 of the way in, I realized that I didn't care for any of the characters and thus didn't mind if someone was hurt. That is what made this a disapointment."
2,Characters diminished by bad structure,"The author obviously paid very high regard to the characters in her book. Her treatment of them all as sensitive souls shows her gentle approach to all of the book's mechanics and story development. This is what made this book so caring, yet so bland.I'll say harshly; Ms. Edwards should now return to academics of story structure basics and research skills, with a bit of grammar rules thrown in. I felt as if I was reading a draft, not a published piece.In addition to unnoticed skips during the edit process, there are many factual errors, as cited by other reviewers. One that surprised me was about the brochure and the art museum. The other is about bluebirds; Norah expresses concern about the future owners feeding them. Bluebirds don't take to feeders; they are insectivorous."
1,Not What I Expected,"I thought this book would be great. The back sounded very interesting to me. A lie so deep. But as I started reading the book up to page 100 I found it very dull and I thought it was a waste of my time. It was a real disappointment to me.I was even planning to do a book report on it for school, I thought it would be that good!"
2,So-So Read,"I was so frustrated reading this book. I am not sure I believed the main character, a doctor who gives away his daughter to a nurse & tells his wife that the daughter is dead. The deception causes the family to fall apart and then later on in the book he rescues a pregnant teenager and helps her raise the child. A little unbelievable despite the fact it is fiction."
2,DON'T WASTE YOUR PRECIOUS TIME!,"I bought this book with such great hope and enthusiasm. The premise of the story was so interesting, complex and thought provoking, how could it possibly fail? But fail it certainly did. I lost interesting after less than 100 pages. The author meanders to random incidents that don't matter, strange tangents, and you find yourself shouting, ""Big deal! Who cares!"" I thought I was alone in these thoughts but quickly found out that all my friends agreed. The book is more hype than substance. I imagined it in the league of The Lovely Bones or The Kite Runner. BOY! was I wrong!"
5,Stayed up all night to finish this amazing book,I bought this book on a whim and got home and started reading it and could not put it down. This book is amazing I know some of the other reviews by people on here say that the characters did things they would never do in real life but thats why its fiction! Thats what makes this book so amazing the characthers lives are turned up side down by this horrible lie and it's just a great novel and well worth the read just don't let yourself think so much about what you would do just let yourself go and enjoy this marvelous story about how one decision can change your life and everyones around you forever. I will always love this book. I felt their pain as I read the pages.
2,"Empty characters, too long. and unbelievable plot","I think the story could have worked, but things just went on and on, and the characters were all so stuck in their own little slots. They weren't ""real."" I kept seeing this book and had read the back several times and wanted to read it, and then a friend recommended it, so I bought a copy. Mistake. I didn't ever like the characters (and I mean any of them!). The plot was plodding, and the ending was kind of predictable and silly. I just felt like I wasted good reading time on this book when I was done. I will often be willing to try an author again, but this one put me off to the point where I wouldn't even check one of hers out of the library."
2,Wonderful premise. Tedious telling.,"I was really hooked from that first scene and the description of the main character's meeting his wife & their love for each other. If it hadn't been for that first scene hooking me so hard I don't think I would've made it through the book. Sadly, the relationships felt so void of attachment. The characters were so self-absorbed -- not just the main character. After a while I just found the story depressing - not sad. I always finish a book once I start it, but this one tested me."
2,Hardly Memorable,"While the cover and premise drew me to this book, I have to say that both my mother and I were bored with the story. I found myself skipping whole paragraphs in an effort to finally get to the ""good parts."" I felt like a grey haze permeated the book and left the reader feeling relieved after reading. It was something to ""get through"" rather than relish. The story itself is interesting, but I think the writing drained the book of all its ""umph."" The characters seemed flat and too tormented. If I had to plot this book on a graph, with time on the x-axis and plot/interest level on the y-axis, there would be a straight line across the page. Needless to say, I had high expectations and felt disappointed."
3,MEMORY KEEPERS DAUGHTER,"The book held my interest, but at times I was frustrated that they kept dwelling on the loss of the twin daughter. Maybe I am a realist, but going on about something that is in the past isn't healthy and just isn't me."
1,tearjerker,"This novel begins with a great premise, but the repetitive imagery in the writing is a drag, and ultimately the book comes off as melodramatic and maudlin as a soap opera. Similar but better book club picks focusing on the consequences of keeping secrets: THE MADONNAS OF LENINGRAD, THOSE WHO SAVE US, or MARCH."
3,reads like a screenplay,"This was a selection for a book club. I would not have chosen it on my own, but found it a nice read. To me, it was like a script. I could cast all the main characters from my pocketful of stage & screen actors. Some of the others in the group were young moms & found it difficult to get through. Just saying."
2,Big Disappointment,"This book was highly recommended; however, I found it very shallow and boring. It did have potential, but it dragged in so many places, was redundant in almost every chapter. I think that some of the items described did not even exist in the mid-60', for example David ""adjusted the car seat"" for the newborn. If I remember correctly, we used ""car beds,"" for our little ones then, and the baby was usually carried home in Mom's arms. There were a couple of other things that I cannot remember, but it seems that this type of error should be caught by editors. I am a person who loves to read a good and well-written novel. This is not one!"
1,Painful Fluff,Very unlikable characters. Caroline was the only character to sympathize with. Didn't think there was a solid resolution. Would have been literature if even one chapter had been written in Phoebe's perspective.Waste of time.
1,WHAT? WHO? WHY????,"I like to read good fiction that is well written, but this book was a drag from start to finish. The author seems to concentrate far more on her flowery descriptions of the most mundane acts and scenes, but never develops her characters OR the potentially great plot that falls flat on it's face with a sloppy plop at the end of the book. We really never even get to know our characters at all, or even what they really look like. Some just disappear (Michelle, Rosemary, Howard. Where did they go???)It never did take off, and in fact was the most boring read I have had in years. Vague characters who, you find, you don't really CARE what happens to them. And ultimately, nothing really does. Most disappointing was the rave reviews it got from authors that I have respected in the past. Are they just trying to save face? A real disappointment. I will not read anything by this author again."
2,too sad and too slow,"I thought the poetic wording in this novel was beautiful, but tedius. I never stop reading a book in the middle so I skipped about twenty pages midway through just so I could get things moving along. Another problem was how sad this book is. Everyone is so depressed and miserable. And Norah seemed very selfish and unlikable. I actually liked David Henry the most out of all the characters. Whatever he might have done wrong, at least his motives were pure. Everyone else just seemed so self possessed."
2,"Well written, terribly boring.","This book is beautifully written, but goodness is it boring. The plot moves at a glacial pace in a seemingly endless cycle of sadness, guilt, dishonesty, repeat, with no resolution. I had to put the book down without finishing it as it was simply not my cup of tea. My girlfriend at the time gave it a better go than I did, but even she quit on it before finishing despite the fact that she had an outside interest in the subject matter. It really is a shame as the author is very talented in her ability to put words on the page."
3,"""Good"" but too long and drawn out","This book was just ""OK"" to me. When I first began to read this book I couldn't put it down for the first 1/2 of the book. About middle ways through it I began to get bored reading about how their son, Paul was smoking weed and stealing cars and about how Norah, the wife, was out having many affairs. During that part of the book I found myself stopping and taking more ""breaks"" and forcing myself to pick it up again to learn the final outcome of the story. I was a little disappointed in the ending too."
2,No Memories for Me,"I found THE MEMORY KEEPER'S DAUGHTER to be disappointing for me. I chose it for the story which sounded wonderful, but I found the writing tedious. The story didn't move for me. It seemed to be in a midst of a fog with far too many details about things that didn't matter and not enough about things that did interest me. After awhile, I didn't care if I finished it or not and started other books, which I completed, before returning to this one. I wished I'd checked it out at the library rather than spent money on it, quite honestly."
3,Hmmm......,"Couldn't enjoy this one...I felt the author did a good job of writing; however, the end seemed rushed. I turned the page and then one of the main characters dies? The part that should be climatic, was over in two pages....truly? And then all is accepted and well and they supposedly lived happily ever after. Hmmmmmmm.......not one of my favorite reads."
3,review,"the book had a good story, but the details were too much. The book could have been 50 pages shorter if some of the neverending details were left out. the theme and story was good. i only got half way throw it."
3,The Memory Keepers Daughter,The book was pleasent reading. What I don't like is these requests for review.
3,Decisions made in a moment can haunt us forever,"I really liked the premise of this book. I think the happy ending seemed contrived. Having worked with Down Syndrome children and their parents I did not find it far-fetched because the syndrome affects people in many different ways. Phoebe was definitely high functioning. Phoebe's mother, Caroline, drove me crazy. I hated the way she hid for so many years. The tragedy was the way the secret tore apart the relationship of Norah and David; but it was a doomed relationship from the birth on because no relationship could survive that level of deception. I had such a hard time liking and forgiving David for this incredible deception. If I had been Norah I would have been relentless in my insistance to see my daughter; I never would have given up as she did."
2,All build up and no pay off.,"This is my first review for Amazon and I will get straight to the point.The first 75% of this book I was entranced. I kept wondering what the outcome would be. What would happen? Well, the remaining 25% of the book was much less than I thought it should have been. It was very lackluster. It was predictable and did not provide any payoff. The story just sort of spiraled and ended. I would have recommended this book had the last few chapters actually been any good. I am dissapointed."
2,The Memory Keeper's Daughter,"This book is not what the latest press leads you to believe. It is way too long, boring, and the ending is predictable. Beyond the opening chapters this book falls apart.Don't bother."
1,What a yawn!,"Hugely diappointing! I read the media reviews and kept scratching my head wondering, ""Did we read the same book?"" I have read and loved everything from Shakespeare to Dickens, to Austin, to Dostoevsky, and I found this book sham literature. Granted the premise is profound, and the questions raised by the novel's ideas, stimulating. But it had so many incongruities, shallow characters, implausible motivations, it became impossible to believe a word of it. And the descriptive passages bordered on the absurd! It began to feel like Forest Gump meets Peyton Place. A waste of time at any price."
5,Weel-researched and very believable!,"I kept looking for the place in the book where the real characters were referenced. When I got to the end and realized this was true fiction I was in awe! The research that Kim Edwards did was so 'right-on' for the time period, and the story compelling and I couldn't put it down, I had to find out what happened next!while I have a child with Down syndrome, I have since given the book to a friend who does not have a child with Down syndrome and she was as taken by the book as I was.I highly recommend the Memory Keeper's Daughter to anybody who likes to read stories of family, family secrets, and people who will take risks, as well as people who let thier fears direct them! There is every personality in this book!"
1,Don't waste your time,I was very disappointed in this book. Read it to the end and was left with a feeling that I wasted my time.
2,"Contrived, Unbelievable, and Disappointing","I hated myself for reading this, and can't believe I made it all the way through. The story suffers, because in order for it to be believable, the characters have to be so neurotic and tortured that you can't really find them likeable. It's as though they wanted to be miserable and then expected them to feel compassion for their self-inflicted pain. I did not find the actions, motivations, or reactions of the characters to be at all credible. The Bestseller status of this novel explains why Dr. Phil is such a success. For those who roll their eyes at self pity and navelgazing, you'll likely react similarly to this novel.Given it's substantive weakness, it would have to be extremely well written or constructed to work. Unfortunately, the writing is somwhat amateurish and predictable. I've seen worse, but the best way I could describe it is to say it's a mediocre writer who worked really, really hard and came up with a passably readable book."
3,a slow read,I found it difficult to make it through this book though I did finally finish it in the end. The good side is that it made my vacation seem that much longer!
2,Great idea - awful follow through,"This book was so disappointing. I was excited to read it because I had fallen into the trap of believing it was a good piece of literature from critic's reviews. The story line was also intriguing and I looked forward to reading the tale. Although I did not enjoy it after the first few pages, I continued to read it in anticipation of redeeming qualities that would explain all the hype. Sadly, there were none. The characters were poorly developed and the story focused solely on details while skipping over essential parts of the plot. I do not recommend this book."
2,disappointing read,"I was hooked by the story line and it seemed to have such possibilities, however, the book turned out to be a total disappointment. The characters were not interesting at all. The story line moved way too slow."
4,Book Club Picks,"Everybody in my book club loved this book but me. I liked it, but I didn't love it. I loved it only so far. The ending was a disappointment to me. I feel too much blame is put on the husband and not enough on the wife, but I was a minority in this way of thinking among my book club friends.Despite my disappointment with the ending, I would still recommend this book for a tragic look at how Down Syndrome babies were once viewed and how one secret can tear an otherwise loving relationship apart."
2,Chick Lit that didn't deliver on my expectations,"Not to disparage chick lit...Afterall, I'm a chick.And I like lit.I *did* finish the book (which I wouldn't have, if it were ""horrible""...)I just sincerely wished it would pack more of an emotional punch... I honestly expected to ""connect"" emotionally more with the material, and it just didn't happen."
3,A decent read,"I read this book for my book club. It is a decent read. The plot is unusual and the story moves at a quick enough pace. Others have described the storyline, etc. so I won't. I found the characters likeable but flawed -- so they are realistic/believable. There are some quirks with the writing. For example, the author will go into lengthy descriptions of scenes which are quite nice in the beginning. However, by the end of the book, the author develops an infatuation with dusk (everything happens at dusk) and the descriptions seemed . . . canned . . . . if that's the right word."
2,Not a Memory Keeper,"I was recommended this book by a friend. It was a leisurely read...all summer into fall. I seldom read fiction and it was a chore to finish this novel by Kim Edwards. Although the basic plot was interesting, the characters were shallow and too much description of nothing in particular dragged down the momentum of this novel. And there was something missing in the dialogue of the characters....they were flat instead of round, and this was a disappointment for me. I did begin to wonder how this book made it to the top. Sometimes the top is a flop I guess."
2,Where was the editor?,"Considering that I have a dear brother who was born with Down Syndrome (not Down's) in 1964, I had such high hopes for this book. The author's insights into people with Down Syndome, and those who love and care for them are beautiful. However, the author's description of places and events in 1964 do not capture the times at all. For example, no one except scientists used the term Down Syndrome. Mongoloid, however awful it sounds today, was perfectly acceptable in 1964. Other examples are less central to the story, but destracting non the less. For example, 13 year old boys did not go for daily, morning runs in 1977. Few people did. I don't think the interstate system had exit ramps at that time. Nylon stockings didn't come in a wide variety of jewel toned colors....etc, etc. I am trying to get past my frustrations with these incorrect details in order to finish the story. But, I'm struggling."
5,The Weight of Secrets,"On a snowy night in 1964, Dr. David Henry realizes, with horror, that his wife has given birth to a healthy boy and a girl with Down syndrome. While his wife is unconscious, he makes a terrible decision that will affect many lives for decades. He tells the nurse to take his daughter to an institution and, when his wife wakes up, he tells her their baby girl was stillborn. Caroline is shocked to see the conditions at the institution and decides to flee, take the baby with her, and raise her as her own.These two decisions will eventually wreck David and Norah's marriage, put Caroline in an unexpectedly difficult but fulfilling life, and leave David's son feeling a void throughout most of his life.This is an exquisite book, powerful, and gorgeously written."
3,Started great...ended 'not so great',I found myself thoroughly enjoying the storyline until 3/4th of the way through. The 'Rosemary' line and the ending seemed forced and contrived. Borrow this from your local library instead of purchasing this book.
2,What was all the hype about?,"This book began with a strong storyline. Then halfway through it became a drawn out read. I enjoyed chapters that were about Caroline and Phoebe, but those chapters were few and far between. The chapters about Norah and her family were terrible. They were unlikable characters and the book took on such a whiney tone. I could not believe all the people that said this was an interesting read. It was drawn out and generally dull. I would not recommend it."
3,A Sad Memory,"The Memory Keeper's daughter is a tale about a doctor keeping his healthy son and giving away his daughter with Downs Syndrome and then telling his wife that the daughter died in childbirth. It then follows the lives of these characters, showing the family unravel as they are unable to cope with their misery. The story is well written and interesting, but also incredibly depressing. You feel sorry for the doctor, who seems like a classic tortured soul character. The whole book is a little like watching an accident happen in slow motion."
3,Thought provoking,"This book had a slow start and a bland ending. However, the story in between was very interesting, kept me engaged and believable. I felt compassion for the characters and emotional for their lives. I would recommend the story."
3,A fine story trapped within ..,"This is a book about the flaws of humanity: physical flaws, errors in judgement and the consequences of living with those flaws. It is also a book about some of the triumphs of humanity despite those flaws.The novel contains some wonderful prose and describes some difficult choices but never really gives me one character whose role is sufficient to carry me through the challenges, triumphs and events. Perhaps there are too many secrets, too much drama and not enough trust? I'm not sure.I am intrigued enough to want to read more by this author. Clearly, this novel has appealed to many.Jennifer Cameron-Smith"
2,i'm glad i wasn't the only one...,"I'm so glad that I'm not the only one who ended up being extremely bored by this book. It started off being an amazing book--I couldn't stop thinking about it or wanting to read it. But then, like many others have said, by about page 150, I was just so tired of it. It's like the story line kept hinting that certain events would take place, but they never did. It ended up being much more abstract and far-fetched than it began, and that's what made me dislike it.I almost stopped reading it with about 100 pages left to go, but then I thought about how so many people were raving about it and how it was a #1 Bestseller for so long, and I figured that maybe, just maybe, there would be some redeeming factor at the conclusion. There wasn't. It was a waste of time, money, and effort. I tell everyone who's interested that it was incredibly depressing and not worth it."
1,Cries out for an editor,"Starts off great - full of potential. Then declines into a real whine. Over & over again the ""memory"" keeps them separate & never resolves itself. Over & over we hear about how every slight ties back to that one event. I get it, I get it! Then, just when you think the book might wrap itself up in a pretty bow, you get to page 400 - yes, all the way there - and the editor falls asleep! The ""memory keeper"" lives his entire life with no one knowing his full name. One other (contrived) character knows this secret but no one tells the other main characters his full name. Yet, there is shows up on his head stone. Bah, humbug! Waste of money if they can't even get the editor to pay attention."
4,a good read,"i enjoyed this book, even tho i don't believe it lives up to the hype... however, it was an interesting concept (giving away a twin at birth and following the two lives), and I liked how the author juxtaposed the two ""families""...that of david henry and his family vs. caroline gill...i didn't exactly want the book to end the way that it did, but i think it was more realistic than wrapping things up neatly. i thought some of the characters were a little contrived, and that the caroline gill/phoebe storyline was a little too pat; yet, the true measure of a book, for me, is how readable it is...does it keep drawing me me in, do i think about it when i'm not reading, is it hard to put down...this book was all of those things..."
3,The Memory Keeper's Daughter,"I think the book ""THE MEMORY KEEPER'S DAUGHTER"" was somewhat disappointing for me. I chose it for the story which sounded really interesting, but as i read on it seemed like it just dragged on. It was very detailed, however some of the details were about things that werent relevant and just made the book boring in a sense. The generl plot was good and the overall story was interesting but it could have held my attention more."
5,Great book,This book was great. It's one of those books that you just can't put down once you get into it. It also was a tear jerker I loved it.
3,A little too contrived,"On the plus side, the plot is interesting and kept me reading to find out if Norah ever did see or find out about her daughter. However, the author's style lacks grace. Also, some of the events described were very contrived--Dr. Henry getting tied up lieterally; Paul stealing a car for no real reason; etc. Overall, the book is about a B-."
3,Interesting Read,"I thought it was a pretty good read. It kept my attention the whole way and I felt attached to the characters. Interesting story line, not super original but pretty good."
3,Interesting and thought provoking read,"This books seems to polarise those who read it - you either like it or you don't. I fall into the former category. The story of a fathers decision to give away his child with Downs and the effect it has on everyone from that day forward, I found to be interesting and well written, and worthy of the attention that this book has generated.It is not a book for everyone - it suited my tastes because I like very strong character driven books that cover a period of years and the changes that those years bring. Down side is that it is a quite slow moving book, which will definitely deter some readers from continuing to read this book to its conclusion."
3,The Memory Keeper's Daughter,"I recently finished reading this book. Normally, I will read a novel within a few days. This one took me a few weeks, solely because at times it moved slowly, and failed to keep my attention. I compelled myself to pick it back up, and overall enjoyed it. I just wish the pace would have been better-kept so as to maintain my interest."
3,Too much hype,"I was ready for a wonderful, absorbing summer read. This wasn't it. ALthough the topic is interesting, and based on actual events, the story was too contrived, too forced. THe events did not match the responses and the author tried to put it together in a cause/effect puzzle. It didn't work. At the end, characters didn't relate to each other, but instead of depth, we got superficial explanations not worthy of a sophisticated author. It was disappointed and not memorable."
3,Great concept gone bad....,"It's not surprising to learn that Edwards' novel of abandonment and lies spent time on this year's best seller lists. The concept of a doctor delivering his own wife of twins, and then giving one away because of Down syndrome, while keeping the secret -- well, it was a masterful plot. Edwards, however, could not continue the pace and clarify the way in which this life-long lie overshadowed all that was good in his life. Her writing is rich in style and word, but her dialogue was unrealistic and the conflict not really resolved.I finished the book wishing somehow that she could have given the idea, the concept, to a writer who could have brought the situation to fruition and finished the novel in a less clumsy way.3 stars."
2,What a painful disappointment,"Like others here, I bought this book at the bookstore because it was on the bestseller table and the cover was cute and it had an interesting synopsis. NEVER judge a book by its cover! The writing was tedious, the characters uninteresting. I thought the wife was petty and unforgiving, the son an ungrateful brat, and the nurse too insecure that you don't bother cheering for her. The father seemed a decent man whose normal faults the author made monumental. Give me a break, Lady. I'm feeling generous in giving it two stars instead of one. Maybe because I'm a twin myself, so I liked the idea of a book about twins. The only reason I skimmed the book to completion is that I was stuck in a hotel in Alaska."
5,"Great book, unique story",I highly recommend this book. I thought the story was so unique. I could barely put the book down!
2,"not recommended. good writing, good sub-plot, very sub-par novel.","I'll keep this short. The writing is beautiful, and the idea is interesting. However, this is not an enjoyable book to read. The sub-plot was far more interesting, romantic, and generally compelling than the main plot, which for me was the main flaw. I found myself wanting to skip large sections of the book to get to the better parts. I honestly did not want to read on, but I happened to be on a plane and very bored with nothing else to do. I give this book one star for writing quality, and one star for the sub-plot. Nothing more. I do not recommend this book. If you are looking for a book in this genre of contemp. American fiction, I'd recommend the Time Travelers Wife."
2,Interesting premise but ultimately disappointing,"The premise is fascinating - a daughter given away because of Down's syndrome and the nurse who raises her instead of taking her to an institution. And for the first few chapters, I was really hooked by the characters, their different ways of dealing with the situation.Unfortunately I found it very melodramatic after that, the way it always focused on how sad everything was for the family. People didn't really seem to change in the family's story, although there was more change in the nurse's side. I found it a bit unrealistic, every moment seemed so charged and emotional, at some point I think the characters would've become a bit more normal through sheer weariness.An interesting book that could've been a lot better if the characters were more explored and given depth."
4,It's fiction attempting to depict real life - - could you do better?,"Only in fiction can a great storyteller convey how one seemingly simple choice can revolve into complex consequences that affect entire generations. Step into the shoes of selfishly arrogant (read: normal) people and try to imagine how you might behave differently under the same circumstances. Long story short, a worthwhile and not-terribly-long read :)"
5,Great Read and Excellent Book,I really really enjoyed this book. I like to read so I picked it up at the store because the name sounded familiar so I thought I would give it a shot. From the first chapter I knew I was going to like it. There is something about the book that just drew me in. There are so many deep emotional battles that all of the characters face throughout the book because on one decision made when twins are separated at birth. Each character differentiates so much from one another yet they are all connected by a little girl. Highly recommend!
5,Wonderfully unexpected!,"This novel was very fufilling. It was depressing but at the same time heart felt. I enjoyed this novel very much and would rate it more than five stars, but only for the unexpected turns in it and for the wonderful way it is written. Great read!"
1,good writing; improbable scenarios,"our book club read this book. we enjoyed this author's writing, unfortunately her characters were forced into contrived and improbable schenarios. although none of us are writers ourselves, we would have appreciated a more organic character development and less forced plot twist (a la judy picault). promising start, alas, a disappointing ending."
4,I loved it!,I have shared it with many of my high school students and the girls fight over who gets it next!
3,Could have been shorter,"There's a great story here, one that also is an impressive psychological study, but it could have been shortened considerably without losing much of its impact. The author goes into too much repetitive detail that adds little to the plot -- for example, why do I as a reader care what someone smelled like? I did find it interesting, though, how the author was able to span the decades and show the effects that one decision could have on so many people. There are some good life lessons to be found here if you can get past the unnecessary verbiage."
3,depressing,"The real world is tough enough. This novel is very, very well written. However, my wife and I both ended up disliking the wife and the son and feeling sorry for the husband (father). If you prefer happy themes, don't read this."
3,Just OK,"I gave this book 3 stars because of the promising premise. I actually did not like it and would not recommend it. The story and characters fail to engage and in the end, it's entirely predictable."
3,"Good story, but some of the characters become tiresome","What would the marriage of David and Norah have been like if he had not made his foolish decision? Pretty much the same as it was, it seems to me. Norah, as well as their son Paul, appear to be selfish and shallow, and don't miss an opportunity to blame their woes and problems on David. He is a remote husband and father, but is better developed, and more self-aware than they are, and so more interesting. Their whining and complaints became tiresome. If the other characters had been as well developed as he was, it would have been a better book, though the story was still well-told and intriguing, with a good sense of place."
4,"Good Plot, Wishy-Washy Characters","The plot of the story is an interesting one, but the characters and their actions are just too sentimentally mundane to be realistic. The book reads far too much like a melodramatic soap opera with little substance. Dr. David Henry comes across as a man with no spine and no ethics, particularly for a doctor. Norah, his wife, appears as if she is a creature in la-la-land going through the emotions, clinging desperately onto her husband's every word as if he is a Greek Adonis. As for Caroline, the nurse who absconds with the baby girl, she is the only interesting and realistic character in the book, but the events in the book all fall in place far too easily to the point where the entire scenario becomes unbelievable and loses credibility. Let's just say, the book left much to be desired."
3,badly written but very discussable,"This book starts out with a strong first chapter and goes down hill from there. Repetitous, with side stories of breast cancer, Kent State and who knows what else thrown in, the storyline slogs to a cop out ending. Basically this is story of a doctor who gives away a less than perfect twin rather than subject his young wife to the inevitable sadness such a child will bring to their lives. Ironically, this secret does exactly what he hoped to avoid, destroying him and his relationships with both his wife and their remaning child.Despite the novel's many flaws, our bookgroup agreed that they enjoyed reading the book, and the book launched a very lively discussion."
4,A Modern Day Fable,"Kim Edward's THE MEMORY KEEPER'S DAUGHTER reads with the elegance and poignancy of a modern day fable. This is the story of a secret wedge that grows and separates us from the ones we love. This is any family and every family, about what we withhold, what we tell ourselves is best, and the hard lessons we all must learn. It's fiction--and truth--at its finest. While the book meanders a bit in the middle, the prose is always pristine. The opening scene packs such a wallop that it would be near impossible to not take a breath afterward. It is well worth the read."
4,"sad, but soul satisfying","Much more up-beat than I was led to believe. Very real to life characters. I really liked how the author made the reader feel for not just one but all of the characters, regardless of their choices made in the book. Redemptive story, could have been morbid and sad, but surprisingly not. Give this book a try!"
4,Emotionally Charged,"This book was great. The story line is good, but I could see how it may alienate potential readers in the very beginning. Though it does not end the way I think it should have, it is a touching story about love and how far we will go emotionally for those we care about."
5,FANTASTIC READ,BOOK WAS IN GREAT SHAPE ... LIKE NEW. BOOK WAS A GREAT READ. ENJOYED IT VERY MUCH. PASSED IT ON TO MY DAUGHTER.
5,Memory Review,I was very please with the fast delivery of my product that I ordered. I would certainly order from this person again
3,Not Great But A Good Read,The title says it all. The premise of a set of twins being separated at birth due to one being Down's is good but the author did not develop the story line to this reader's satisfaction.
2,Not great at all,This was ok nothing more I bought with a new book by Conrad Jones called Soft Target which I read twice it was so good unlike this I am afraid.
4,A Page Turner,I know it's a good book when I have to fight the urge to skip to the end and see what happens. I've been reading too much non-fiction lately and wanted to relax and be absorbed in other people's lives. The Memory Keeper's Daughter was perfect. Vivid characters and writing that is descriptive but never tedious. This is a wonderful novel.
2,A read disappointment,"We all know the premise of this novel, and there is no need to repeat it here. But since I don't want to be a spoiler for anyone who has not read the book, I will summarize by opinion of this novel by simply saying that there are too many factual flaws - child is suppose to have died but there is no death certificate, no undertaker, not body???? Woman takes child and raises it and has no birth certificate????Characters always manage to have something fortuitous happens - perfect man comes into a character's life, perfect opportunity, perfect job, etc.A character obviously has a serious drinking problem but apparently it goes away and she lives happily every after. In many situations I kept waiting for something bad to happen, but good fortune comes along and saves the character.For those who liked the novel, dream on. But in my opinion it bordered on being a fairy tale.The author also could have cut at least 50 pages and there would have been nothing lost."
2,OVERRATED.,"Although this book is well written, I found it incredibly difficult to get into, which was my initial instinct after reading the inside flap. After several people recommended it, I gave it another try, but found myself skipping paragraphs because they were so dull."
3,Just Okay,"I liked the story, but I found it ironic that the author takes the time to thank her editor at the beginning of the book, yet there were multiple spelling and grammatical errors throughout."
2,Full of Ridiculous Drama!!!!!,"This book sounded interesting enough and it was...at the beginning. We read it for our book club so was eager to jump on in. It wasn't one of my least favorites but you keep waiting and waiting for something to happen. Nothing does. Hence the title, you would think the majority of the book would be about Phoebe but it isn't. I got a little sick of Norah's self loathing to be quite honest."
1,Annoying Lifetime TV plodder,"I read this book for my book club, and I'm now debating whether to tell everyone how bad this book is before people waste money & time on it. In reality, only the portion focused on Caroline were mildly interesting; I skipped Norah's story entirely after the baby was taken.The book is overwrought and too full of itself. Boring, annoying, preposterous. I did not care for the author's writing either.Skip it."
2,Long and boring,"It didn't live up to the hype. I struggled to keep reading it day after day, week after week."
3,"Verbose, Incomplete yet Somehow Touching","I didn't think this book was awful, but it was overwrought. I did cry once, and there were a few passages/interior monologues that were deeply insightful. But the book was just too long, and the symbolism too obvious. I felt like the characters were fleshed out in a writer's workshop, and the plot meticulously planned. Overall, this was a good beach read, a solid entry in the Quinlen/Picoult etc. chick lit genre. The author mentioned that she read Crime and Punishment and tried to channel the sense of remorse that Raskolnikov felt. Um...Dostoevsky got it right. Still, an impressive debut novel and I would read/buy an Edwards book again."
1,Pathetic attempt,"I don't know why this woman is on the best sellers list, or has any popularity at all. She wrote that mermaid chair book, which was terrible, and now I went to read this book, becaue it was a interesting story line, and I have to say that it did have good reviews, so I gave it the benefit of the doubt. I shouldn't have. It sucked.First of all, the book had all the all the makings to be fabulous. But it just fell sooo very short. I swear, I never want to see the word deft again. I don't know how many times I read it, but she needs some new adjectives. It was so flowery and over described. She tried to capture these moments in time, and she just didn't get there. The characters never really connects to the readers, and when the book ends, your more happy that you don't have to read her writing any more, then the characters become content. It was an over done, over written, bad book, that pissed me off, because the idea had the potential to be great."
4,the memory keeper's daugther,"This book was unique i couldn't decide if i loved it or hated it, thought provoking, brillantly written. I kept thinking of a better ending, but there was none- it left me unsettled. I loved the characters they were so real, people i know"
2,Disappointing,"I was looking forward to reading this book and it kept my interest, (sort of, it got a little slow towards the end,) but the main characters were not very well developed. I found it difficult to feel much of anything for them (or even like them,) and kept thinking that I would have, given the subject matter, if they had been better written. I also found it very hard to: (1) believe that any real people would act and react in the ways of the characters in this book, and (2) appreciate how the marriage between Norah and Henry ""deteriorated"" (or at least I think so, since it's not entirely clear whether it was partly because they just did not know each other well when they got married,) since there was not much of how it was between them before the birth in the story. Overall a decent read, but not deserving of the praise it has received."
4,Thought Provoking,Once you get into this book you can't put it down...I enjoyed the fact that it went back and forth from the Dr. to Caroline. Loved the story line of both their lives. I have picked this book for my April Book Club. Hope the ladies enjoy it as much as I have.I'm glad it had a happy ending
2,Doesn't live up to the hype,"I had heard from a few people that this book was GREAT and that it touched them emotionally; so I was anxious to read it with my fellow bookclub members. Unfortunately, I thought the book was just so-so. I didn't like any of the characters and had a hard time empathizing with them. The author used a lot of imagery in her writing, but it got old fast and the book seemed to drag. The entire story line made the book basically a real down-er. Plus the ending was somewhat abrupt, and not real believable. I was not alone in my opinion of the book; my bookclub friends didn't care for it much either."
4,Enjoyable,I really enjoyed this book. I found it to be a little sad throughout. There were some loose strings at the end of the novel that I wish had been resolved. Definitely pick it up if you are looking for an enjoyable read that may cause some tearing.
2,A quick jump off a diving board into an empty pool,"This book was more than just a little disappointing. The first few chapters had me hooked, but I quickly discovered that the plot wasn't really going anywhere - a great idea that took off and then flopped miserably."
3,"Good read, but disappointing",I guess it was the fact that David Henry never gave his wife the opportunity to make the choice and judge for herself whether or not she wanted the baby with Down's Syndrome. I must be a woman of the new millenium because we have choices these days.
1,Very very bad!,I never got the book. The person told me they shiped it and i never recieved it. I have ordered things off of amazon befor so i know my address is correct. It was for a school project and now have to go buy it and read it in very little time I would not buy for this person!!!
4,Tragic and sensitive,"This book was a good read. It did a good job of showing how one person's choice can ripple out and affect so many other people. I thought it could have had a better ending, though I'm not sure what I really wanted it to be.All in all, it was very good. I'm glad I read it, and would recommend it."
1,BOR=ING...waaaaay to long,This book started AWESOME...but it was soooo long and boring. Way too many unnecessary words - I skimmed most of the book so i could just get to the actual story. I did not like this at all. Huge disappointment.
3,forgettable...,"I've become a somewhat avid reader of fiction in the past year or two. I always seem to stumble onto books that capture my attention. I was sure I had found such a book in The Memory Keeper's Daughter. It had the look, the feel, the ""smell"" of a good read.As I read the book, I kept waiting for it to pick up...for something to happen that really grabbed my attention. I am a huge fan of Jodi Picoult, so I guess she's spoiled me in that regard.I kept telling myself it was a ""slow burn"" kind of book and would catch fire in ""the next chapter"". Unfortunately, it was a slow burn that just fizzled to nothing...In the end, I found The Memory Keeper's Daughter to be - in Simon Cowell's words - ""forgettable""."
2,Not a likeable character in the bunch...,"I'm sorry, but I hated this book. I'm apologizing because I really seem to be in the minority there. I heard so many great things, but how can you like a book if you don't like ANY of the characters. I thought they were all pretty dispicable. I don't really care if it was 1964 or not. The only redeeming quality is that it would make great fodder for a book club discussion if that's what you were looking for."
2,"so much potential, unrealized...","this story started out with so much ambition, so much potential and hope...it starts out strong and it made me think it was going to be one of those truly ""good"" books (e.g., the lovely bones, three junes, the corrections) but instead it meanders and it falters and it never quite lives up to expectations. after all the great things i'd heard about this novel, i was more than a little bit disappointed when i FINALLY reached the end."
2,drags on with unnecessary descriptions,"The premise of this book is great... and if perhaps every other paragraph was removed, this could be a great story. unfortunately, edwards jam packs the book with boring descriptions of sand and clothes and streets, the way wine is being poured, windows, voices, you get the point. everything imaginable is given ten times more page time than it deserves, making for a very distancing experience. it makes the tone melancholy and bland, nothing pops with excitement or draws you in.it's a pretty awful book, and i'm not sure why i'm making myself continue reading it."
2,Where was the editor?,"The fascinating premise was wasted on a poorly written piece of fiction. It seems that a good editor could have helped the author to clean up problems with historical accuracy, with the flow of the story, and with consistent characterization.If you try to spend your precious reading time on good fiction, this book is not a worthy selection."
2,Yawning in frustration,"Unbalanced. Repetitive. I was frustrated with the length, and found myself rolling my eyes thinking, ""you said that FIVE TIMES!"" The climax was disappointing (hehe) and unsatisfying (hee hee). The concept was strong, but the writing was not. It should've been at least 100 pages shorter. The narrative was bumpy, in fits and starts. Don't buy this unless you are prepared to be bored. The content doesn't make up for the lack of writing."
2,Boring!,"I know this puts me in the minority,but I couldn't stand this book. It's full of long-suffering people in a long-suffering environment, and it requires a long-suffering time to get to the end of their plight."
2,was expecting a lot more..,"I really thought I would like this book, and I really wanted to! When I was reading the first few chapters I was pleased! The plot seemed fantastic already, there was drama, interesting characters and an awesome story line. Things about half way through just kind of fell short. Like a previous reviewer said, there was points in the book where you thought oooh this is gonna be great! And then nothing. So overall I would say this book wasn't horrible, I still managed to finish it and didn't feel like I completely wasted my time, but I don't think I would recommend it. I was just expecting a lot more."
1,meh...,"I think that this book has a great theme, from what I read, but it moved incredibly slow. I could not really connect to any of the characters, no matter what angle I was looking at! I thoroughly enjoy reading books of all kinds and one of my biggest regrets is not finishing one, but I definitely do not have any guilt putting this one down."
5,That's Entertainment!,"Paul's books never disappoint! The inside information, entertaining anecdotes and insights which his books provide make them a must read for every tennis fan and player. His books make a great gift for every tennis lover."
5,A Great Read full of smart and fun quotes,"- Ever wondered what many of Tennis Great Players actually talk like? Well, after reading this book, you'll know it all.It's the type of book that at first you may underestimate. However, after the quick flicking through pages turns into real reading and the ndoubtably memorizing of quotes, you understand that you are having fun while gaining insight as to the minds of Tennis Champions from the present and the past.Enjoy! But be prepared: You will be spending more time reading and re-reading this book than you ever expected."
4,Founding of Virginia,"This book is written in the style of an ""historical account of happenings."" I thoroughly enjoyed the first half of the book which told of John Smith's early adventures and his coming to America then setting up the first English colony. The second half of the book however, did not include John Smith himself, just his policies and ideals. The latter part of the book told of many subsequent men who headed Virginia and how their successes were based on John Smith's early ideals and requests (usually not met by England or the colonists of his era). It is a good book for study with the first half being the better read.PS. Students can get all the information they need on the founding of Virginia by reading only half of the book's 190 pages."
5,American Genesis: Captain John Smith and the Founding of Virginia,Graet addition to any library on American history. A book one can always go back to for insights.
5,Love on Branch Line,One of the gentle but great British comedies. Great casting of theater trained actors who make this a really enjoyable & hilarious romp. Extremely watchable time & time again.
3,Okay,"This is supposed to be a hilarious comedy. Where are the laughs, let alone smiles? Sure, there are many eccentrics bounding about the countryside. But none of them is being funny. I'm a great fan of British comedies, but I can only recommended this to insomniacs."
2,Cheap,"They are cheap handcuffs that don't even lock with some pink fluffy fabric wrapped around the wrist... seriously just go buy some nice fabric, roll it into a tube and place it around some real handcuffs it will work a lot better then these. The fabric they use on these are so thin that it doesn't even help if you actually do anything rough with them."
1,Pure fantasy,There is no language in the world that you can learn in one month... that I knew.. but you would need more than three months just to learn the first chapter! The didactic of the book is obviously not of the XXI century... and again... the first chapter requires three months with full dedication...Look for something more practical.
2,Passable,"I'm currently living in India and was dismayed when I saw the price on the back of the book, which was a little over $1. That's what it sells for here in India. It's a struggle to find decent texts on local languages here, but if you can, keep searching. The book is not very user friendly, and the print is faded, smudged, and difficult to read. Obvious that it was printed in India as well. The book is helpful if you have someone nearby to practice with, but otherwise it'll be a long haul learning solely from this resource."
4,A skynard winner!,"Enjoy, once a skynard fan always a skynard fan.It rocks, It's southern, and sends us to that whitebird."
4,Really good music,"I think this cd proves Johnny is the only singer that could replace his brother Ronnie. This cd was made before he became LS singer, this is a good example of what was to come. Good voice, good songs, good musicians.Keep on rockin Van Zants."
5,The Best,"This CD is a MUST HAVE for all ya'll SKYNYRD fans out there (YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE)! Gimme'a Hell Yeah! Brickyard Road is the greatest. Long live ""Ronnie""!~"
2,It's okey but not great,"""Brickyard road"" is a blend of southern rock and pop-metal. Johnny Van Zant is the brother of the late Ronnie Van Zant (Lynyrd Skynyrd's original singer) as well as Donnie Van Zant (38 Special) - could their dad's name be Sonny and their mother's Bonnie?. Anyway, most of the songs on this album is rather average or mediocre but that doesn't mean they're worthless - they're just not outstanding. But the song ""Brickyard road"" (about the feelings for Ronnie) is really great, and clearly show that Johnny Van Zant can do much better than primary shown on this album."
4,excellent,"Norman Haines was in a band called Locomotive who released an album calledWe Are Everything You Seearound 1970.Both that album and Den Of Inequity are organ based, slightly psychedelic rock, common in the early 1970s. Picture, at least in parts of this, a heavier Procal Harum.The singer has a high voice that is not that strong, but this actually works well against the big backdrop of the music, which has a very open recording style.Den Of Inequity is not the most original album, but for dynamic art-psych you can't go wrong here, either."
5,teachergrade1,Great product! I liked the size of the workbook....even though I was expecting it to be bigger or of at least normal page size. No biggy....you just zoom in when your copying! Speedy delivery. Excellent condition! Have used it a lot.
4,Great for signal splitting,I would have rated it 5 stars if I did not already own the Radial Switchbone. Great way to use two amps either separately or as a pair.
3,"Decent Price, OK sound/feel","When I opened the box and found it was already strung I weasn't too happy, but I tuned it up and played for a bit. Not a bad feel to it and a decent sound. For the price it's not a bad option, and it does have a good look. It should be a good first guitar for my son, but I felt the neck is rather thick for it's size. Hopefully it won't be an issue. Didn't have any problems tuning other than what can be expected with new strings."
3,Not bad!,"It's very cute, a nice size and sounds great for the money. On the other hand the bridge pins are really fragile, and the holes in the bridge are too small for any of the pins I've tried to replace them with (even the Hot Rods pins, which everyone says are tiny). I think this guitar is worth it for anyone wanting to learn to play, but are on a tight budget."
1,Won't hold a tune. Don't buy it.,"Bought this for my 8 year old daughter to take lessons with. My father plays alot and tuned the guitar. Within 5 minutes it was out of tune. Tried several times assuming the neck would settle in. So far no luck. Continuous tuning is needed. Even the teacher tried and could not make it stay in tune. Bummer, otherwise looks nicely made. We haven't returned it because the box was destroyed in transit."
5,Born to Sing and Licensed to Kill,"The Supremes set the standard. TLC broke new grounds. Destiny's Child keeps up the tradition. The Spice Girls threw a wrech in the clock. However, only one woman singing group's music stops me in my tracks no matter what I'm doing.""Born to Sing"" introduced the world to the quartet known as En Vogue. If you're soul isn't lifted after hearing ""Hold On"" or ""Don't Go"", you're either souless or just plain dead. If you like things that are sexy, sweet, sassy, seductive and smooth, you'll want this album. I recommend all of En Vogue's records, especaily this one."
5,This album represents the EnVogue we all know and love --,"This album represents the EnVogue we all came to know and love -- when there were four members of the group and they were striving to make it in the music industry. ""Hold On"" is a song that can be heard 20 years from now and one will still bounce their head to. Also gems on this album are ""You Don't Have To Worry,"" ""Lies"" and ""Waiting on You."" I recommend this album to anyone who likes to hear good singing."
2,Average,much was the case with much of their Albums the Material didn't always highlight the strong Vocals they have.Hold On was a tight jam.if given the right Material they could have been the next Emotions.now they were the Best Female Group of the 90's but it could have been more than that.McElroy&Foster are Talented Brothers but they were Hit&miss with En Vogue.
3,SONGTRESS OF SOUL!,"One thing could be said about En Vogue: they truly could hit a note. Although voice is not everything, their debut album had some fine moments, but truly missed to be an exceptional album, that would be gratified later in their sophomore ""Funky Divas""(a masterpiece). The highlight of their debut was without a doubt ""Hold On"" a perfect show up to the world, this hit single made them a name. The rest of the album sound like clones of the first and got lost in between each other thanks to their similarity, but, in all that mist you can find some worth listening joints like ""Lies"", ""Hip Hop Bugle Boy"". After all, debut albums of Girl Groups has always been a preshow of the cream of cop to come later, just rememeber names like The Supremes, Destiny's Child & TLC, their debut where not exactly masterpieces of art."
1,DISAPPOINTING,"i found this album to be disappointing the only good song was ""hold on"" nevertheless i think they're very talented and should use their voices in a different way and dont scream as much."
4,"Born To Sing, and they will Sing!","The music is pretty different from the rest of the other cds I have heard from R/B when they were making their mark in the 90s and I guess this music kind of stood out with their female vocals which includes all four of them Cindy, Maxine, Dawn and Terry... I thought that they were just an average R/B group that was going to come and go like the most of them. However their music stayed and they have generated from this album into a big success for sure. With their video clips and their image no wonder they took the world by storm and left a very big mark on their fans for sure. It was the begnning and I guess this was where they started off. The music is okay but gets better with the other two albums. Time to put you groove on for sure and dance to music so this music for me rocks my world."
1,Charles And Me,"The book is boring, boring, boring! Pat Shannon is a TERRIBLE writer. It seems as if she has a thesaurus right next to her as she writes - - trying to insert the most obscure, complicated word possible. I purchased the book seeking information about CHARLES, and since his name was first in the title, I figured this was what I wanted. It wasn't. She made it as complicated (mainly about herself) as possible. This was the only book I could find on his secret love with Pat. I just had hoped for more. Probably a third person should have written the book, but obviously there wasn't one. I would never recommend this book to anyone, even if you are a Charles Kuralt fan."
2,Listmaking and decorating,"I bought this book to see how a world-famous TV personality could lead a parallel romantic life for many years in Montana unknown to his wife and children in New York. The writer does not broach the question with any depth at all. Essentially she writes of travel, menues, decorating, designing cabins and yards, itemizations of wildlife seen, and on through out the book. There aren't any insights on conflicting relationships that I could identify. I wouldn't buy it a second time."
4,pretty good shower rod,We have an old claw-foot tub in a small bathroom and wanted wanted an inexpensive solution that would allow us to create a shower. One of the challenges was the slanted ceiling that the vertical piece needed to attach to. This rod was was the cheapest option we saw and it worked out just fine. We overcame the ceiling challenge with a wedge-shaped piece of wood where the vertical piece meets the ceiling. We're pleased with the outcome.
4,It serves the purpose well,I have been overall very satisfied with my hoop shower rod. It was fairly easy to install and serves the purpose. It is also fairly attractive.
4,"Functional, easy to install, good price","It's certainly not the prettiest product out there, but the price is right and it fit our needs perfectly. Installation is fairly easy, although 1) you do have to be careful you don't mistakenly interchange parts (there are some similar parts which only slightly vary in size) and 2) it is helpful to have someone help you (in hindsight - I worked alone) when actually connecting to the wall/ceiling.Overall, it does what it's supposed to and feels sturdy enough."
4,Practical but a little flimsy,I am satisfied with this product. The instructions on putting together and mounting were not clear but it was not difficult to figure out. It works exactly as described but it does not seem sturdy. I would not use if I had small children because it seems they would be able to easily rip it down. Great for an adult or older children.
3,Wobbly,I would have liked to have seen a better way to connect the pieces together and the bar going to the ceiling only has a set screw in it to hold the two pieces at the proper height. It concerns me that it may come apart if we are not careful when pulling the curtain back to get in or out.
3,zenith shower curtain rod,due to the small selection of this type of rod it was a good buy.better mounting points would be better and a heavier gage would be better.But for the price I think its a good buy. We'll have to see how it holds up.Two of the mounting points arn't very staple allowing the rod to float.
3,Shower cutin,This worked for what I needed but it is to narrow. I plan to use it as Is then make somthing wider out of copper. Overall this worked and has kept the floor dry
2,Really difficult assembly,"All of the pieces to create the oval circle of the shower rod should snap together easily - but they don't. The hardware and the instructions to assemble this product are ridiculously complicated. It sat here in pieces on the floor for weeks, because I can't figure out how to assemble the many many loose pieces, screws, bolts, etc., plus you have to have someone stand on a ladder and hold the product in place while it's being installed. Now that it's in, it's serviceable, but certainly not worth the trouble."
1,not worth it,The book contains 50 personal statements and not much else. The personal statements were not relevant to me or my friends. I did buy this book and others. I think the best ones were Insider's guide to med school admissions by Toyos and Princeton Review. Read this one in a bookstore and you will see it is not worth it.
2,Pretty good book for personal statements BUT,"This is a pretty good book as it has 50 personal statements. But, this is most of the book's content and it is also dated. The admissions process is so complicated that you need a more comprehensive work. I have looked at all of the books on getting into medical school and the best one without any question is the Definitive Guide to Medical School Admission by the Goldsteins."
5,Enchanting voice of Fairuz,"The enchanting voice of Fairuz, accompanied by a unique mix of Arabic and Western classical musical instruments and melodies, make this a sublime introduction to Arabic language music.Fairuz's voice is incredibly, powerful and expressive, so even if, like myself, you don't understand Arabic, her voice will encourage you to feel what she saying."
1,"Oshun: Santeria and the Orisha of Love, Rivers and Sensuality","Frankly, I've not read this book, nor do I intend to. I was searching for information on the AFRICAN religious traditions. Oshun is an AFRICAN Orisha, so how the heck does she turn out to be a white woman on the cover of a book about Oshun??? I will reserve my time and money for the books that truly depict the ethnicity of the traditions and people they evolved from, not some white washed reinterpretation of an ancient AFRICAN gift to the world. As the saying goes, ""a picture is worth a thousand words"". The so called author of Oshun: Santeria and the Orisha of Love, Rivers and Sensuality should be ashamed of what appears to be yet another attempt to erase the cultural influences of African peoples and credit them to Europeans instead."
1,more LIES,crap. There are more authentic books about Oshun elsewhere. It's crap like this that give the Yoruba religion a bad name.
4,Stainless Steel Vegetable peeler,"I have been looking for a stainless steel vegi peeler since I lost my original one. This peeler does not fit the bill.Feels like I am peeling backwards as I have to peel toward myself and the peelers width it small. I am still looking for an easy to use stainless steel peeler like the one I obtained when I purchased some stainless steel knives long ago!I bought one like it at a Flea Market in Ft Myers,Florida but have lost it![...]"
1,"Flimsy, lightweight","Impossible to use, dull blade wobbles, not a sturdy or weighty product. Cheap and tinny. Not comfortable in the hand, more liable to cut your knuckles when the thing you're trying to peel slips out of your hand because the blade just won't cut through the skin of an apple, carrot, potato. Horrid utensil."
1,Plastic,I was trying to find a decent quality rocker panel but this isn't it. These are cheap plastic pieces. Save you money for better item.
5,Just like advertised,"Great Price, delivered right to my driveway. everything was there. Takes a few days to put up and a second hand is a must. I had it for 2 years and it still looks new. I live in the northeast so I purchased the extra roof supports as well. The one we had prior to this one caved in after 10 years of snow. I expect this one to last 15 or more."
3,okay..,"well I don't like bizzy's new style I prefer the old bizzy but other people obviously do as you cansee the 5's and good comments about the cd, I heardi t and I don't like it that much so yeah, I dunno.."
2,I had enough,"Don't get me wrong Bizzy Bone is a very creative rapper, somewhat unusual thou'. I've been following Bone Thugs career for the past 12 years. I've watch their style change, and may I add change isn't always good. This album I really counld't feel it. I think he might one day become a preacher, a thug preacher at that. I think Bone Thugs should of stayed with Ruthless, I know that sounds crazy, but I think they would never let them get this bad. This album is ok, just because he's bizzy. He needs to stop talking about jesus, god, revelation, anything related to holy spirits. If you really listen to all his music, you'll discover that this doesn't make any sense. Ruthless, get your act together and sign these guys back. Help them before they jeopardize what little fame and fortune they got. If you disagree with anything I said. Holla at me. outtava2003@yahoo.com"
2,THE FALL OF BIZZY BONE,"THIS ALBUM IS HELLA WACK STR8 UP, AND DOWN! AND BONE THUGS IS ONE OF MY FAVORITES, BUT I CANT TAKE NO MORE SOLO BIZZY ALBUMS. HIS BEATS SUCKS, AND HIS MUSIC SUCKS. DONT BUY THIS ALBUM."
5,Bizzy does it yet again!,"Bizzy Bone is top notch, with Bone or without no doubt to this. Just about every song on this joint is ""top charts status."" Excellent with no flaws. Keep doing what you do Baby Gambino"
4,Unique,"Pro: ""When I See"" is a near masterpiece. Its good to hear a rapping about something more spiritual instead of ho's bitches and money. In ""Play It Again"" and ""Maybe You Can Hold Me"" bizzy is singing directly about Jesus, and guess what? It sounds pretty good. Takes a real artist to get outside the box and produce music like this. Looking forward to more relases from Bizzy.Con: 10 actual tracks 7 which are of quality. If you want to purchase individual tracks i recommend in this order ""When I See"", All day all night, play it again, one time, its only me, they don't know, maybe you can hold me"
1,You'll scream with frustration!,"Where to start.You only get to play certain transformers on certain levels, you hardly get to play Optimus prime at all.You're cannons are pointless as must enemies just shield themselves and most characters need to be hit with something, like a tree or a brickbefore they stop being invincible.Some levels are so frustrating you'll scream, e.g.- Theres a level here where Megatron can be kicked around by ""invincible"" Autobot characters, which is just weird.- When you're Blackout fighting Ironhide he's hard to control, easy to kill and trips over everything.- Many levels are 20 minutes long and if you die you start again.No replay value, barely any play value.Stay miles away unless you're a hardcore Transformers fan why isn't bothered by anything."
4,Hard but fun. May be too intense for older gear.,"We have been playing this game for a day now and it looks good but some levels are really hard. For instance, we are stuck, as the other reviewer wrote, as Skorpinock. It does get a bit unclear where things are when you are surrounded buy junk like trees...and targeting can be tricky because there are so many control options. We have a Pentium D 3.0 GHz, 512 MB Radeon 1950, 3 GB RAM. The best part so far has been mass destruction for no reason after leveling."
1,Watch the Movie the 100th time will still have more fun than playing this game the first time.,"Buggy stages design.They made the driving part of the game difficult by simply making the handling of the car modes of the robot extremely twitchy and hard to control instead of the stages itself being difficult.Lame enemy attacking and counter-attacking mechanism. Beating the bigger enemies only involve throwing vehicles or objects towards them at specific time. There is no other way to beat them, it's the same from Barricade to Megatron. It gets boring after a couple times.Save your money for other Transformers Toys or for the Transformers 2 movie tickets, just don't spend it on this game."
4,Tough Times in Her Majesty's Military,"We all know the tales of colonialism and the difficulties of the post-colonial period. But what about the emigres to the island of the mighty, the head nation of the commonwealth? Well, Kwamdela describes the plight (and eventual flight) of the Black British Soldier, whose parents left Lagos in the late 1960s. The prodigal son, who tries to be the best Britisher possible (sound familiar?), winds up trapped between two world. He is cursed at, spat upon, and otherise belittled by his dear mates (sound familiar?) and even endures--until one day, all hell breaks loose. The conclusion is full of dramatic overtones. A terrific book!"
3,"Mars Volta - 'L' Via L' Viaquez, Part 2' (Universal)","Another high-priced CD single to promote the band's 2nd disc 'Francis The Mute'. ""Bible And The Breathalyzer"" (5:15) is so-so, most certainly nothing to get excited about. But I liked the well played ""L' Via L' Viaquez"" (12:21) plus the edited down version of the video (5:15). Didn't realize that Mars Volta had so many CD singles out."
2,HHHmmmm,"L'via is awesome, Mars Volta is awesome, Bible and the Breathalyzer is garbage, waste of recording time and cd space, talking over generic background noise...."
3,worthwhile,"Not as impressive as some of his other work, Dream Quest is still one of the best in the genre. If you like Lovecrafts other works, you should read this for comparison sake at least. It tends to be needlessly wordy and rambles without any driving energy to push the plot foward. All that having been said, I liked the book. If you can get it cheap, do so."
5,Lovecraft's most Dunsanian tale,"Strange realms operating under Randall Carter's dream logic.The sound of yak bells across the distance of the coldwaste, beyond which lies Kadath, lingers with me still.Nyarlathotep warned of the dangers of the gods, whoseconcerns are not the same as ours, and who lust after thecity of light out of Carter's youth. But Carter's journeys,his encounter with Night Gaunts (of whom it is best not tothink too much), and his amazing rescue by the cats ofUlthar make this my favorite by Lovecraft. Be warned,however, that this is fantasy and not horror."
1,lying about liberals at any cost,"I hate to tell you, my misguided Republican friends, but it was George W. Bush, not Al Gore, who stole the elcection. This book is a well crafted web of right-wing lies, carefully suited to meet the agenda of Conservatives. It points out minor clerical errors and irrelevant facts while not even mentioning huge portions of the controversy. what about Katherine Harris telling 55,000 black Democrats that they could not vote, because they were accused of felonies in 2007? Of those voters, only 12 were actually guilty. The really reason the Supreme Court handed Bush the presidency? Because, during the first Bush Administration's waning days, then Defense Secretary Dick Cheney secretly offered all nine justices a big, fat retirement package, in exchange for a few small favors during the next Republican administration. But, hey, it's a guy from the Washington Times. Lying is what they do best."
1,Canoeing down a New Hampshire river,"What does the infamous (and spun) canoeing trip down a New Hampshire river have to do with the Florida election issue? Maybe one of the four star reviewers can clear this up for me.I've read a few of the many books out about the Florida election and when I got to this one .... well, it's just amazing how the same event can be characterized so differently.If stealing was going on, it wasn't coming from the democrats. If anything, he actually wasn't aggressive enough (and even in the face of many telling him should have been).I suppose people will believe what they want to believe. The fact that one of the candidates brothers is the governor of the contested state, it's secretary of state was the republican campaign manaager in Florida (she's the one who validates the election results), and republican operatives were advising her what her stance should be doesn't appear at all to be a conflict interest is quite curious."
5,To all of you Libs who gave it ONE STAR,"I wish I could give it SIX STARS. I am so glad that Bill was able to uncover tidbits that I did not hear on FOX NEWS during the 30 some days of Algore allowing the country to fight amongst ourselves. This is the definitive book of that ordeal. I almost want to extend my hand in friendship, realizing that you now must realize the truth ... that Algore (like the Clinton's) doesn't care about you or me or the Country ... only himself. As a Compassionate Conservative and proud member in good standing of the Vast Right Wing Conspiracy; part of the 23.5% of Americans who lives in a 'normal' relationship (husband, wife, children); Life Member of the NRA; Church Elder ..... I extend my hand in non-partisan friendship."
4,"Excellent Book, that is, if you are open-minded","There is so much ""spin"" out there, and the real news never seems to make it to press. This is a great book that brings the facts to the table, facts that the press just sort of let die as news since they didn't feed the mob mentality that necessarily sells papers."
1,"oh, please","Well, this just goes to show how inept Al Gore truly was. Thank goodness for Mom and apple pie that GWB actually DID steal the election ( or did Scalia have something else in mind when he declared that any redress for Gore would cause ""irreparable harm"" to Bush, as if we were still in the age of the Divine Right of Kings?). As if Hannity, O'Reilly, Noonan, Will, Novak, et al. would not be shouting about ""the Panhandle"" if there was validity here. Oh, and were those Democratic staffers banging on the voting office doors, to shut down a legal process? Excuse me, but unless this book is satire, there are some huge leaps of, shall we say, faith."
1,Not credible,"This book was garbage. You can expect some sort of bias from most writers, however Bill Sammon takes it to the extreme with this nonsense.Do not buy this book."
1,Ballot stuffing Republicans!!,"I find it hilarious that some jerk would support a book about Gore ""stealing"" the election while ""voting"" multiple times under different aliases. The reviews below by ""John Wain,"" ""Anna Mae,"" ""Vince Elliot,"" ""Ray Delaney,"" ""Sam T'Angelo,"" ""John Costa,"" and ""Kerry Jackson"" are all by the same person. Do you think he has enough brain cells to understand the concept of irony? Will these conservative a--holes stop at nothing to advance their agenda, including going through the trouble of registering multiple Amazon identities and writing multiple reviews of the same book? All of his ""reviews"" were written just prior to the 2004 election. Was this Republican trying to sway the election by writing multiple supportive reviews for a book about a Democrat (supposedly) trying to sway an election? Unbelievable! What a bunch of yahoos! I patiently await the day that this country returns to sanity when dittohead idiots like this crawl back under the rock they came out from under."
1,Axe to Grind?,"Bill Sammon must be angry about something. He has totally disregared the facts. He has some how convinced a publisher to help him with his anger management. I wonder how much money the publisher will lose on this book. This is not a good work of the facts pro and con. Every American familiar with the Florida debacle knows the key players were Jeb Bush and Katherine Harris and the U.S. Supreme Court. History will not be kind to these individuals but for some reason Sammon is. If you are into hate, blind loyalty, big Bush family fan, and mean spiritedattacks, then this is your book. If you are for unbias reporting and opinions and you purchased this book, then you wasted your hard earned money unless you want a laugh or a conversation piece. Luckily for me a friend gave me the book because he got it from someone else. I will give it to someone later but I am having to much fun marking pages and showing others how bias a writer can be."
1,How can anyone take this book seriously?,"Sammon pretends that this is an investigative report of the ""facts"" of the 2000 election. But look at the other book he's written -- it's all about his years with Reagan. Someone who is so egregiously biased does not make a good reporter -- reporters are supposed to be objective. He's so obviously left out certain facts (like the purging of ""felons"" from the voter rolls who weren't felons at all - this is well documented by Greg Palast in the U.K. He is the only reporter willing to tell the truth, since the mainstream media is in the Republicans' pockets.) If you want the facts about the 2000 election, don't go here. This guy is just another shill for the Bush camp (as are many of the plants who wrote positive reviews of this book. Funny how you can always tell an author plant - they have names like ""a reader from New York"" and no e-mail address to contact them.)"
2,Predictably Slanted,"We live in an era when almost every author has an axe to grind, and Bill Sammon is no exception. The substance of his book was predictable, for how could he say anything good about Gore and the Democrats when he works for a man who claims to be the new messiah, and is the sugar-daddy of the political and religious right."
1,Partisanship at its worst,"If anyone has ever read The Washington Times, you already know which political party they embrace. So it comes as no surprise that Bill Sammon puts all the blame on the Democrats for the Florida recount mess. Showing no signs of objectivity, I am disappointed that this was the only book to make the Time's bestsellers list. I also must agree with the previous reviewer about how angry everyone else was when reviewing this book. And what about the Supreme Court case that followed Mr. Sammon?..."
5,Gore is a selfish thief!,"This was an excellent review of the Florida recounts. I especially liked the explanation of the four 'rings' that described Gore's priorities, in which he was the most important and our country rated fourth."
5,Excellent coverage and very well written,"Great book, very well done and very complete. Facts back up everything Bill covers.In typical democratic fashion, Gore sought to smear and cover up. Anyone who disagreed with Gore and his Goons were either illiterate, deceptive or worse.The dems need to find a way to disagree that involves refuting the evidence instead of just calling the other guy bad names. Look at the other reviews of this book for a little example of this in action. Example: weasly, sycophantic coward from, little critical faculties. I also noticed that these people chose not to remain anonymous."
5,Includes startling stats on election night media bias!,"...This book has become a reference manual for me -- I plan to use its contents to shut Liberals up when they start sobbing and crying about how ""Bush stole the election"". The fact is that this book is a thorough account of the post-election mess complete with behind the scenes interviews and even stats on media bias on election night! Though I watched the media's coverage like everybody else, I was shocked when I read the stats in this book!...Highly recommended! Thank you Bill Sammon for writing this book! You're a great American!"
5,"Great Book...At last, the Truth!","Finally we hear the truth about the Florida Supremes, Al Gore's obsession, the true scam of the century! We need books about election-2000 voter fraud in Detroit, St. Louis, Wisconsin, Philidelphia, Oregon, New Mexico and Chicago as companion pieces to this eye-opener and well-reseached book! Now we know for sure who really has the centuries-old skills at election stealing, the Democrats! But this time it just didn't work!"
5,The Truth Will Out,"This book tells us what happened behind the scenes, while the presidency balanced on a knife's edge. It shows how the network's early, inaccurate call of a Gore victory in Florida robbed thousands of voters in the Florida panhandle (Central time zone) of their vote and their voice, and cost Bush the clean and unquestionable victory he otherwise would have had. Sammon's interviews with the network news presidents shows the blinkered arrogance of the media. This is a must-read for every open-minded Gore supporter."
2,Limits its audience...,"Had this book made even a pretense at being objective, I'd be giving it four stars. The first couple chapters about the media misteps are very interesting and show a side of the election many have not seen. However, the rest of the book degrades into pure fantasy, portraying Gore et. al. as evil whilst putting the Bush camp on a moral pedestal.If you want to convince liberals of the error of their ways, this certainly isn't the way of doing it. Sammon has limited his audience to the hardcore reactionary audience and has thus lost his chance to convince any undecided people. By preaching to the choir, Sammon essentially defeats himself."
1,This is a great book if you like fables,"This book simply blurs the facts and at some points is false. If you are looking to reinforce a skewed view of the 2000 election and facts aren't something you believe are important, then this is a great book."
1,Are you people nuts???,"I'd actually give it ZERO stars. How can there be the reliable information available that JEB BUSH and CATHERINE HARRIS purged 90,000 eligible voters from being able to cast a vote...Over 90%were democrats...How the hell did GORE try to steal the election when JEB BUSH and CATHERINE HARRIS stole over 90,000 democratic votes and G.W. won by a plurality of 537 votes??? To me it is clear as day that BUSH actually STOLE the election through help fom his brother JEB and the republican Sec of State Harris. Those facts not only make this book laughable, but grossly inaccurate and totally unfounded...Check the facts out!!!"
1,The Gospel According to Rev. Moon and His Cronies,"This book is pure propaganda, and the numerous ""fly on the wall"" descriptions of Gore strategy meetings read like bad TV drama. Rev. ""I Am the True Messiah"" Moon and his cronies are pushing this book ""big time"" as de facto President Cheney would say. Not surpring, since Sammon gets his paycheck from Moon's Washington Times. If you want to read a decent book about Florida, check out Jake Tapper's Down & Dirty."
1,no news here,"I had high hopes for this book but if you read it you will find nothing that hasn't already been reported elsewhere. Jake Tapper's Down and Dirty had everything this book does, and more. Take this book's big revelation that a Gore advisor started the rumor that Jeb and Katherine Harris were having an affair. Tapper's book already reported that. That Gore was craftily micromanaging the recount effort with an eye toward just recounting counties that were pro-Democrat--Tapper already got all that. And on and on. Sammon makes a big deal about the fact that Gore staffers were happy when they got 1,000 overseas ballots tossed out. But is it news--or surprising--that they were happy? I'm sure Jim Baker and his guys were happy when the US Supreme Court voted the way it did, but I don't need a reporter to tell me that fact as if it were a big, important, revealing secret.If you want the full story, this is not the book. What a disappointment."
1,A Sick Joke?,"Apparently, Mr. Sammon forgets that Al Gore won the popular vote by a not-insignificant margin. So it is not unreasonable for many people to believe, as I do, that if any theft was done, it was not by Mr. Gore. Apparently, however, it is not sufficient for Mr. Sammon to see that we now have the first 'selected' president in over a century: he wishes to rub salt into the nation's wounds and make a profit while doing so. Shame on him and shame on those who swallow his pap."
1,"For the TRUTH, check out Michael Moore's Stupid White men","You've got to be kidding. Why would Bill Sammon admit to being a reporter for the Washington Times if he wants to be taken seriously? Did he get permission from the ""True Parents"" to write this hokum?Michael Moore's book Stupid White Men tells the truth about the entire election debacle in Chapter 1: A Very American Coup. Even if you disagree with Moore (and I vehemently disagree with his criticism of President Clinton), you owe it to yourself to read both sides of the story."
1,Attention Lemmings!!,"The fur flew on the path to the cliff -- who would get there first? Mr. Glass?The ocean roared below, faster-faster, the little pitter-patter feet scratched and clawed, till the drop-off. The front furries furiously attempted to stop, but the back furries pushed onward -- remember honor and integrity!And the jumping began, and did not stop."
2,New from the cradle of democracy,"How can you people get so anti-Gore when the results from one state didn't matter? Gore got more votes than Bush across the whole country -- irrespective of the number of state representatives voting, Gore got the mandate from the American people. Okay - I have to say I haven't read this book, I'm only commenting on other comments. But the fuss about pregnant chads pales when compared with roadblocks stopping people getting to polling stations and whole boxes of voting forms going missing. Don't mock Gore for little things when Bush was just as bad (and more dim along with it). Also, who decided that a mechanical stamping machine was more efficient than paper and pencil? Here in the UK, we have a form with boxes and you tick a box - simple. Until the votes are stored and counted electronically, there is nothing to be gained by automation."
1,Disappointed,"A freind that is an avid member of ... insisted that I read this book to find out ""the truth about the election."" I saw nothing new here and in fact it made me wonder why the publishing company took on the project so soon after the election with such sketchy info. The ""data"" was a lot of build up and no pay off in my opinion. This is a fluff piece for hard right conservatives. I will be anxious to read a more moderate view of the election even though I normally consider myself a Republican this book raised more questions in my mind about the potential corruption by Jeb Bush and cohorts than it did about Al Gore which was supposedly the point of the book??? Sensationalistic IMO a person has to wonder what the motivation was behind this?"
1,Majority rules!,"I think what 95% of Americans understand as they were taught is just that,""Majority Rules""!"
5,Intriqueing - Fantastic behind the scenes information,"Yeah, I know this book has been around for awhile, but everytime I see Al Bore on tv, act like a spoiled child throwing tantrum, I feel that I need to reread it and I did just that this past week.You willl find behind the scenes information on what really happened in this book. This is the stuff the democrats are trying to deny happened and the media failed to report. It will make your blood boil!"
5,Gore acted like an idiot,"After election 200, I may never again vote for a democrat. Al Gore's actions, obviously sanctioned by the democrats were disgusting.And in looking at how the democrats are action now in preparation for election 2004, obviously the only thing that has changed is that Al isn't running this time, but the democrats that are, are no better.Ralph Nader is looking good though. Beats voting for a democrat."
5,What the Democrats claimed never happened!,"Although I followed election 2000, I still found information here that was covered up my the media and the Democrats in particular Mr. Gore who said; ""Every vote must count"" but cheered as mlitary votes were thrown out.As a foreign born but proud American, I find these tactics in poor taste. Win at any cost is not a good strategy and I believe that Mr. Gore and his party are paying dearly for that right now.Al Gore is a disgrace to his state, his political party and his country. It's no wonder that election 2000 made America the laughing stock of the world."
1,Pointless drivel.,"Extreme boredom compelled me to start reading this book - profound boredom compelled me stop. Bill Sammon blabs on endlessly at a grade-school level about nothing in particular, occasionally detouring to drop a fishy-sounding factoid on the reader before rambling on again. Though I could not bring myself finish this book, I can't imagine there being a point to all this - especially since history has revealed Gore actually should have won the election, having gotten more VOTES. I'm surprised this is still in print."
1,Whaaaa!,"More gross fiction about the 2000 election and some lemmings are still buying this stuff? Few facts, a pile of inuendo and outright fabrications are the ingredients of fiction. Proof positive that even when the paranoid right steals and election, they feel compelled to continue the distortions and shift the blame. ..."
5,It Is A Must Read!,"This is a well-written and well-documented book. Even though we have just gone through this election, and much of it has already been reported, this book puts all the key events in a logical and interesting fashion. It is even fun (although quite disgusting) to read."
5,You'll never hear about this on CNN,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. My only complaint was that I wish some areas had been explored in more detail. It does, however, give a general insight into the character of Al Gore, an amoral (i.e., typical) Southern Democrat, who would (and did) do anything to further his own personal ambition.The book also contains interesting portraits of the minor players in the drama of the 2000 elections. It brought back some personal recollections, as I, like many others, was transfixed to my television.This is no political science treatise, however. It is simply an entertaining yarn, full of insights you didn't hear about on the news. In the interest of full disclosure, I cast a rather lukewarm ballot for Bush, not really concerned who won. I did, however, develop a distaste for Gore during his post-election conduct. I didn't know the half of it."
5,"""At any cost"", political junkies should read this book!","I lived the presidential primaries, the campaign, and the election, on the edge of my seat. Glued to the tube, and online constantly, reading everything I could find, from all sides. A big time political junkie, I thought I knew it all, and understood every nuance of what was being reported. But reading this book is a fabulous, behind the scenes eye opener, and great fun to read.Al Gore should be advised to stay outta sight till Mr. Sammon's book is off the bestseller lists."
1,"Sorry, ""George Bush"" is not spelled ""A-l-G-o-r-e"".","What next, a book about how Al Gore lied about ""weapons of mass destruction"" in Iraq in order to justify an illegal ""pre-emptive"" invasion? A book about how Al Gore threw away the surplus? A book about how Al Gore plunged the nation into huge deficits? A book about how Al Gore cost the nation millions of jobs in a mere two years? A book about how Al Gore systematically reversed or undermined nearly every environmental safeguard as a favor to his corporate polluter contributers? A book about how black is white, up is down, and two plus two equals seven hundred and nineteen?"
1,Almost Unreadable,"I piked up this book in hopes of finding some insight by a journalist that one has a right to expect would tell a story with some professional integrity. Unfortunately, I was sorely disappointed. It is so clear that the author has an ax to grind, that you cannot know whether or not what he claims happened is even true. The editing is also sloppy, and the publisher clearly does not have very high standards. What a disappointment."
2,Waste of Money,Nothing new or interesting here. How can I best put it-a waste of time. Wish I would have spent my money on a Janet Evanovich novel.
5,"Shocked, SHOCKED at lack of Democrat integrity","Having been born a democrat and raised during the JFK Administration, I am SHOCKED at the total lack of integrity demonstrated by the democrats during election 2000.What is even more shocking is how they are trying to cover their tracks and even have mindless people defending their position.What ever happened to the Democrat integrity of the Kennedy tradition. JFK was indeed the last great Democrat leader.What a shame that this once great Democrat party has deteriated to this level.The good news is that I don't think that Al Bore could get elected for dog catcher right now. The bad news is that a once great political party desperately needs an overhaul. Current democrat leaders, sorry to say don't look much better than Al Bore.Shocked, totally SHOCKED at Democrat misbehavior."
1,Where's the Beef,"As a dyed in the wool conservative who savored W's victory in the Florida recount, I was looking forward to reading At Any Cost. I was extremely disappointed at this rehash of newspaper clippings. Where was the behind the scenes insights into what the power players were thinking when the cameras were not around? I could have written this book without any interviews. What a disappointment to those who were looking for more insight."
5,Some people just can't take the truth!!,"Call me naive, but I would like to think that politicians should conduct themselves in an honest manner. This book gives a good insight into the behind the scenes shenanigans of the Florida debacle and proves that my hope is far from reality.In this book the truth of to what extent the Gore campaign went to swing the election in his favor if exposed. It is interesting, but nonetheless expected that liberal reviewers bash this book, but notice one thing: there is not one bit of factual information to rebut what is described in this book. To borrow a line from Jack Nicholson ""You can't handle the truth!"""
1,Moonie Propaganda,"Another disreputable hit-piece from the Moonie-owned hard right propganda organ, The Washington Times. I have to make a confession - I was unable to finish this book. The usual stale right-wing stew of distortion, obfuscation, ommission, half-fact and outright lie perfected, and subsequently exposed, by David Brock (see Blinded by the Right), made my gorge rise too much to read on.If you are a fan of a certain well-known porcine pundit, famed for his fact-impaired rants against liberals, ""feminazis"" and anyone to the left of Attila the Hun, I'm sure you'll love this rancid polemic - otherwise, stay well clear...."
2,Not as soft as Charmin,"Well, I would have rated it higher, but frankly, the Sears catalogue is better bumwipe than this piece of EIB institute training material was....""Liberal"" media indeed!"
1,Author needs to reexamine his premise,"One of this author's primary contentions is the media prematurely called the election for Gore in the contested states of the Northeast and Midwest like Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. Recent data from those states however affirm that turnout rose significantly from the 1996 election and, as every Republican partisan like this author is probably aware, depressing turnout was one of the preeminent strategies of the Bush campaign to carry those states in the 2000 election. Thus, effective mobilization of Democratic voters in those contested states was what really determined Gore's victories there and not any premature calls from a putatively partisan media."
1,Bottom of the barrel,"My review of this supremely foolish book is confined to an objective report from the AP in the wake of the media recount of the Florida vote (the caps are mine): ""The new data, compiled by The Associated Press and seven other news organizations, also suggested that GORE FOLLOWED A LEGAL STRATEGY after Election Day that would have led to defeat even if it had not been rejected by the U.S. Supreme Court. Gore sought a recount of a relatively small portion of the state's disputed ballots while the review indicates his only chance lay in a course he advocated publicly but did not pursue in court -- a full statewide recount of all Florida's untallied votes."" If you want the truth, don't look for it w/ Sammon. Enough said."
2,Only after you've read everything else,"This is a hard core conservative's dream book of truth. Hard core liberals will read it to make them feel superior. Unfortunately it's just a bad book that seems to have been, literally, thrown together. Repitition and bad editing are evident throughout.The first 2 chapters about early calls and the probable effect on voting nationwide are pretty interesting. Not only is the case laid out pretty well but the topic has never been widely covered. No doubt because the people who caused the problem are the one's who would have to do the covering.After these chapters, it's pretty much the same formula over and over. Gore, and almost everybody who worked for his campaign, are vile swill. Bush, and the Bushies, are honest, fearless, etc. While undoubtedly true, it gets boring and really not worth reading."
1,How ironic! A Republican complaining about voter fraud!,"This book is just another one of the many books writen by the right wingers with zero evidence, and total misleading of the readers.If you want to know what really happened during the election, go read up about the Felons list that disqualified people who weren't even felons, another list was given to Florida before the Election by Texas... go figure. And the vast majority of these people who were wrongfully disqualified vote Democratic.How about the Supreme Court ruling for the Republicans? 2 Justices wanted to retire during a Republican term, not a Democratic. They voted party lines, not as judges.There are countless other examples of how Republicans stole, and won, the election. I hope that in the future, there are board reviews that can go over books to make sure they are telling the truth. ...Hypocrisy is horrible."
2,No ground-breaking going on here,Bill Sammon's style is usually more compelling and I found myself struggling to get through this piece but it did have some amusing parts some political junkies might get a laugh out of.All in all though most of the ground has been covered repeatedly. Some of Bill's anecdotes have been recycled in the mainstream media so many times I found myself almost able to predict what Bill was going to write from one page to the next.
4,"Liberal or Conservative, Author of $oft Money recommends...","Despite your political affiliation, this is a must read. Bill Sammon has done a fantastic job bringing the behind the scenes actions of the last election to the attention of the general public. I love a good conspiracy and I write and read in the fiction genre, but on occasion I read works in the non fiction arena.This book was both compelling and disturbing. It is fact that reads more like it should be fiction. Whether you agree with the outcome of the election or not, this exposes the possibilities of problems in future elections and brings to the surface the real actions of the men who seek power in our government."
2,Huh?,"If this is supposed to show that the election wasn't that close, how is it that Gore actually received over 300,000 more votes that Bush? The only reason Bush one is that the electoral system favors the small states and discounts the votes in the more populace states. A weird system that tends to benefit conservatives."
3,Eh,"Sammon gets the facts right (including setting straight a lot of the leftist distortions and out-and-out lies repeated in Tapper's book -- ironic, given that Tapper is the first person he quotes in this book). However, this book is more of a narrative from several points of view than a well-researched and well-documented attempt at journalism. Much of what he provides is anecdotal and not documented.For those of us looking for a more scholarly appraoch, we have to keep waiting."
1,Worthless and dangerous,"One of the most moronic pieces of ""analysis"" to hit the bookstands. This book should appeal to those who have no tolerance for detailed, legal analysis, but who have a decidedly conservative bent that needs constant stroking. Buttresses the worst sort of legal prejudices without addressing the inherent contradictions, and the outright hypocrisy of the Supreme Court's decision. Ultimately, will be regarded as another lame attempt at right-wing spin control, which is ironic given that ""they won."" What this really best illustrates is the degree to which Bush's reelection is jeopardized by the circumstances of his appointment by the Supremes. It is so uncertain, they're still spinning the coup wildly into something it is not. Worth buying on the used-book rack as a bit of insight into the right-wing lunatic fringe, then using as kindling"
2,At Any Cost - A Bipartisan Review,"As an avowed Conservative that followed the November election as if it was the Superbowl, I eagerly looked forward to this book. I went into this book knowing that the author writes for the more politically conservative, Washington Times. However, for all the hype this book simply did not deliver. I felt I was reading recycled and warmed over news leftovers. I did not learn anything new. I do, however, recommend this book for those people who are not ""political junkies"", and have finally decided to read about the November election. As I read this book, I couldn't help but remember that old Wendy's commercial, ""Where's the Beef?""."
2,Rebuttal to Scot Davis' review,"Mr. Davis's first three sentences are lies, so it makes me hard to believe anything else he says. The recount showed Bush would have won. I would also challenge Mr. Davis to name ONE SINGLE PERSON who was not allowed to vote in the election in Florida, let alone 8,000; Jesse Jackson couldn't.The book is actually kind of boring because it rehashes things we already knew if we kept up with the story as it unfolded,but it does seem to be factual."
4,"Excellent analysis, short on inside information","This book was an excellent chronicle of the events in Florida following the 2000 Presidential Election. I was, however, a bit dissappointed that the author failed to get in depth inside information from all sides vis-a-vis Peter Baker's book ""The Breach: Inside The Impeachment and Trial of William Jefferson Clinton"".Unfortunately, what in depth information did exist in this book seemed to come from only one side causing the book to lose its non-partisan appearance.One of the most insightful and telling accounts in the book coming from the ""other side"" (Team Gore) was the account of Al Gore's four concentric rings.I, however, would reccomend this book for no other reason then the book does give an accurate picture of a lot of the events in Florida as well as some revealing inside information. The book should stand as the first and (as far as I can tell) only book on the historical election for President of the United States in the year 2000."
3,"Good, but mostly rehashed news","Sammon takes a journey through the surreal world of post-election 2000 while it was still fresh in most's minds. I intensely followed all of the developments while they were occuring, so unfortunately for me there was less insight provided. The majority of the book is simply a chronology of the incidents that occured in Nov/Dec 2000. There were several interesting pieces of information, such as the detailed information of VNS and a complete description of how each network bungled the Election Night events.I enjoyed reading it, but if you followed the events of Bush/Gore 2000 closely, you may want to spend time reading something else as not much new is included in this one."
4,Thoughtful and engrossing,"It's sort of a no brainer that those who supported President Bush would find this book interesting and those that supported Mr. Gore would find it ""lacking"" or just plain wright it off as right wing spin.Somewhere in the middle what you have is a book that you just can't put down. I found the disection of how the media reported results fascinating. State by state, Sammon highlighted how long it took the networks to call a state for Mr. Gore and how long for President Bush. If you ever doubted that there was a liberal bias in the media, this section of the book, alone, could convince you otherwise.Don't let the bashers fool you, this book isn't going to win a pulitzer for investigative journalism, but it's well written and VERY informative!"
1,Overpriced At Any Cost,"What this volume adds to the great debate of our time are a few dry ounces of pulp. In all other respects, I found it to be fair, balanced and unafraid."
1,"Republican lies, anyone suprised?","The greatest lie ever propagated by the right wing is that the media is liberal. Why didn't Sammon question the fact that Bush's own brother was in control of, and therefore responsible for, and election so sketchy even the Cubans mocked us?Being from the Florida Panhandle, I actually know most folks to be liberal in Tallahassee, for the simple reason that they are educated. Leon County was also the only precinct that did *not* report a change in numbers after investigation, and Gore held the 60% margin."
1,Awful Toaster,"We received this toaster as a gift this Christmas and it might be one of the worst toasters ever. None of the slots toast evenly and even though the slots are plenty wide, they aren't very deep so some bigger bagels and slices of bread go untoasted at the top. The controls are limited and any setting higher then halfway is pretty much just a different degree of burn. As it claims, it's good for doing different items at one time and the extra wide slots are good but that's about it."
3,very informative,Thank you for your valid information. We are looking for information for 'bale insulated' wallls.Very enlightening.
4,the eco book,"book shows an idea how to build a eco friendy box like shed witch shows you how to build the footers ,floors,walls etc but doesn`t show u alot of other homes being built like if you were thinking larger scale and what i mean is like if i wanted to built a 2 story cob/adobe etc home. great starter book ,nice colored pics,alot of pages ,i would recomend it to anyone wanting to know about cob/adobe, straw, ecofriendly, living roofs, etc. buy the book its def worth it"
4,Practical and insightful,"If you are a builder or ""newbee"" to building and considering a book that shares good to great ""how-to"" perspectives on green technology, this is for you. One structure, from foundation to finished form, is discusses with a minimal over-view of the history and / or examples of other structures related to this small home.I have been reading, studying and participating in green building technology for about 7 years. I have an ever-growing library related to natural processes and green technology. This is one book I'd recommend to anyone interested in hands-on learning that's well presented. You'll want to keep this one."
4,Great book,"This is a great Koestler book, gets you a very good understanding of the nature of his later work, his philosophical way of thinking and why he got to be such a great supporter of the abolition of death penalty."
4,fine book,"A correction to one of the previous comments. There is now an 'errata' on Springer's website. A 2nd edition of the book should be coming sometime, so you might want to check on that before buying."
1,absolutely useless,"It starts out okay, good overview of measurable sets and the like. However, it does not even have the essential core theorem to the discipline stating when it is possible to integrate a function! one of the great thing about Lebesgue integration is that a function is integrebale in this sense IF AND ONLY IF the function is measurable. thats the whole point of having measurable functions. there is no if and only if theorem for RS integration. Plus other things, like it talks vaguely about 'randomly choosing a point' but with no precise definition. Things like that.You are better off buying a classic by Halsey Royden or Walter Rudin, or something like that. This book is useless."
2,An incredible story that will put you to sleep.,"I know a little about Hugh Glass. He was an American mountain man of they early 1800s with an incredible life story that took him from pirating in New Orleans to battling grizzly bears in the wild west and everything in between. So why did this short little 230 page book take me 2 months to read? The way it is written, of course. It is an extremely tedious read. The author can turn a clever phrase but he overdoes it so much that you end up having to decipher every sentence to get through it. Reading this book is like watching the remake of True Grit. Yeah it's English but you have to pay attention to every word to understand what the heck they are saying. It's not the light quick read I expected. A great story but this is not the best place to hear it."
1,Not a novel,"When I bought this book, for some reason I thought it was a novel about Hugh Glass. Instead it is a history book. Dull and boring as far as I was concerned. I did not finish reading it. Gave it away.To me it was a waste of money."
4,Entertaining,"This is an enjoyable read of an early day fur trapper and his adventures (misadventures) in the uncharted wilderness. I must agree with some reviewers that the author can be quite quirky in his writing style with offbeat, way-out puns and phraseology, but nevertheless a good read. Myers justifies the many hardships of Hugh Glass through several second hand sources for those unbelievers of this somewhat, but not, fictional character. Glass was captured by pirates, escaped, then was captured by the Pawnees and later lived with them for some years. He then left the Pawnees and joined Ashley's fur expeditions to the Rockies. Many a narrow escape with Indians, but probably the most celebrated adventure of his life was the mauling by a grizzly and the ensuing tales thereof. One reviewer mentioned how they should make a movie out of this book. Well, they did, many years ago. ""Man in the Wilderness"" starring Richard Harris is based on Hugh Glass and his heroic adventure with the grizzly."
4,"Not easy reading, but worth the effort.","John Myers Myers is a wordy, self-indulgent writer, with a tendency to editorialize excessively and to include far too many side-trips for the purpose of turning a clever phrase.That said, when he has a good story, and really turns loose, you are in for a ride!The first part of this book is more about research than anything else. Myers tells us about the different tellings of the Hugh Glass tale, and how his true story can be discerned from the rural legends that surround him.The second part of the book is Glass' tale, and it's a wild one. He starts off as a sailor, is captured by pirates, becomes a pirate, escapes, is caught by the Pawnee tribe, escapes the tribe, becomes a hunter, is (almost) mortally wounded by a bear and abandoned by his party, and then somehow survives it all. Somebody needs to make a movie of this story.If you are up for a good, somewhat professorial read, then this book will satisfy."
1,Dry Reading At Best!,"Some books grab you on the first page and just won't let go. Others take time to warm up, but then really go for broke.This book does neither.Although the author did his research, and can back up every fact presented in the book, it is written in a style that makes for ponderously dry reading - at best!If you are doing research, then buy this book.If you are looking for a thrilling story full of old-west charm and wilderness adventure, the look elsewhere - this ain't it!"
2,Lots of Information,"I am reading a book about Hugh Glass, that is not actually about Hugh Glass. The author goes into extreme detail about everything and is rather boring."
5,Happy Aunt!,"I bought this case as a surprize for my aunt who received an Ipad for Christmas. She loves it! The red color is gorgeous, and the handles are perfect to hang from her walker. She couldn't be happier!"
1,Version 3 is Crap,"Simply a waste of money. It uses Codec iv50 video driver which is not installed in MS XP after Service pack 2, vista or W7. You can get it to run with a lot of messing around but you will still be disappointed. The computer players can Trade and Build houses out of turn which is just irritating and makes to play slow. Poor graphics, it is hard to tell where your token is on the board. It has some animation and voices assigned to the tokens; I played it on mute because it was so annoying. While Version2 has the same codec issue, it plays much better."
1,Cheating Ruins the Game,"All in all, there is actually very little to praise in Monopoly 3. The music is dull and after a few minutes begins to grate. The voices are annoying from the very start. The game, as noted in other reviews, cheats incessantly; making it a game not worth having.The only reason to actually own this game is to play online with others. If you won't be doing that, and will only be playing against the computer, don't bother. The game cheats to the point of absolute frustration."
1,you get what you pay for,"The 3-D effects and music quickly become annoying. The overall layout doesn't work very well either. With the older version from Westwood, all the players and their property titles are easy to see and assess, and any trades allow you plenty of time to decide on whether you want to approve it or counter offer. When a trade is proposed by a computer player, there's barely enough time to gauge what's going on before the program moves on.If you enjoy Monopoly for the strategic aspects and don't need all the special effects, get one of the older versions. Even the AI players aren't much different in the way they play, and if you're not going online to play, you need AI players that are less predictable and more creative."
3,Flynn Shears Thru Again!,"This is just an average western, where Errol Flynn appears tired. The script is ok and the acting is fair. It's not up to San Antonio by any means. Wish it was in widescreen. BTW, the sheep were great."
3,several sections of silence in the black and white movies,"The title feature is packaged with three black and white westernswhich came up as silent movies in my cutting.The Errol Flynn feature ""Montana' in is colorand is about one of the historical range warsbetween cattle herders and sheep herders in Montana.Some people blame at least part of the desertificationof the middle east on sheep and goat herds,so there is some weight on the side of the cattlemenin country that is dry/ semiarid where grass doesn't grow backwith every rain storm. In Southern California goat herds are used to control brushon public lands. The western is unremarkable except that Flynnplays an Australian because of his accent.I kind of liked the movie but as I said the quality of mydvd which came from the public library was bad."
1,DONT BUY THE VOLUMES WHERE THEY DUEL!,"This is a ripoff, you should buy Shonen Jump! Read Yu-Gi-Oh! Millenium World instead its alot better."
5,Attractive and Sturdy,"This little grater is worth every penny it cost. Not only does it do an excellent job of grating, but it's built to last and easy to clean. I grate fresh ginger and hard cheeses with it almost every day with excellent results."
1,The cover says it all.,"For one thing the book makes women or young women out to benothing more than something which is looked at.What about young men facing a sense of vunerability?Nope,not here.As I said the cover says it all.I have read the whole seriesof books and find the same message 'women are objects' men areobjectifiers'so how can it help teens with real life issues?I think not."
5,"one of the best, for dogs lover","My child (2y.o.) who loves dogs and cats, loves to watch this VTR tape. Even she only understands Japanese. We watches this over 40 times now, she tries sings the songs with VTR."
4,Childhood Win,"I am a long time animal lover, and my avid fascination with large cats and dog probably started right here. I grew up loving National Geographic and I totally loved this particular segment of this show. Anyone with half a brain should know that National Geographic is not a funny kids show, it is meant to be informative for young minds and semi-realistic about natures wild creatures-something I think that this segment stays true to. It is geared towards kids, not toddlers. It taught me the link between predators and domesticated pets, and entertained me.This is a great segment, and I wish I still had the copy I has when I was a kid so when I have children of my own I too can share my love of animals with them.Also, this VHS is a pain in the butt to order if you're not a US citizen (hint:Canadian up in here)"
1,wrong items sent,"I purchased National Geographic's Really Wild Animals: Hot Dogs and Cool Cats [VHS] for my daughter who adores this series of videos narrated by Dudley Moore. When she opened it, it was NOT the correct video, instead it is a video narrated by Jack Hanna on Zoo Life. VERY UPSET! Wish to obtain full refund and correct video, but since it is an amazon seller instead of amazon, apparently there is no way for this to happen. Do not buy from this seller!!!!!"
2,"Lady, Lady",Lacked plot and excess bad language. Book had so much swear words and and street slang I lost interest and struggled to finish
2,"Lady, Lady, I Did It!",I've tried to read several books in this 87th Precinct Series. THEY'RE AWFUL!! Very OUTDATED and amertuerish. Like reading a first novel by a grade school student written in the 1950's. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS AUTHOR!
3,quilting made easyService from,service from amazon always excellent. I was not impressed with the book. Out dated. Would not recomend this book to quilterd.
2,Overpriced - does not feel like WMF standard,"I own many WMF products for the unsurpassed quality. This ladle does not live to the expectation, I have, when I am buying a WMF item. It is very light and doesn't make the impression of quality that typically characterizes WMF products and secures good appearance for a long time of use. So, if you are not totally addicted to WMF, buy a good quality ladle from other manufacturer and save a few bucks."
2,Alexis,"I loved the toy but It just didn't come with enough film. When my mother and I say it on sale 1/2 off we should've figured something out then. If if would've come with more film my friends and I would have had more fun with it. I was only able to take 5 pictures, all of me. I wish I could find more film"
2,Can't find anymore film This is a disposable toy,"I bought this for my daughter for her birthday. We used the film that came with it that had only 6 pictures. I went to the store to buy more film and bought the 12 izone picture packet. However, this does not fit in the Photo Booth. The top does not close to use the film. So not only did I pay for the Item I paid for film that I had to through in the garbage. The Photo Booth has been sitting on my daughters dresser since November and we have to yet use it again."
5,UNSATISFIED DUE TO IMPOSSIBLE PURCHASE OF FILM,"GREAT!! the toy was loved by my daughter but....after using 3 out of the 6 pictures available it was IMPOSSIBLE to find film. it is 2006, if by now you have recieved tons of emails from unsatisfied customers WHY IS THIS PRODUCT STILL FOR SALE??? can someone email all previous customers back letting us know WHERE we can purchase the film??? its the least you can do, after all this product was not cheap...and not returnable so what was the point of purchasing it for a 'one-time' use??? not to mention seeing how disappointed my daughter got when she realized we couldn't find film anywhere...? totally upset and unsatisfied customer....please advise with any info on the purchase of film VERY MUCH NEEDED.....MOM, FROM BRONX, NEW YORK!! FOR OTHER CUSTOMERS THAT WOULD LIKE TO OFFER FEEDBACK FEEL FREE TO CALL 917 918-4243. HAVE A GREAT YEAR - 2006!"
4,Where to find the i-zone film for my photo booth,"I made the same mistake i'm sure most people have made when purchasing My Photo Booth,buying the wrong size film since the product isn't very specific on what film to buy for the camera. So i did some research on the product and found that you may purchase the correct size i-zone film at Ritzcamera.com. And something else that is a big help to when looking for the film is not to purchase the polaroid i-zone film with a size like 200 or 500 on the box,you have to purchase the film without a size on it to get the correct one. But overall when you get more film for the camera it is a wonderful toy. My children love it."
4,Where's the film????,"This is a great toy and had fun using the 6 pictures that came with it, but bought the izone 200 film that Amazon.com had on the website and it doesn't fit the camera! I'm having a hard time finding the film. I spent $17.95 to buy the izone200 film and it doesn't fit. Once we stock up on film, I'm sure we'll have fun using it again."
1,REMOVE THIS TOY FROM AVAILABILITY,"THERE SHOULD BE A CHOICE OF NO STARS...ONE STAR IS ONE STAR TOO MANY FOR THIS TOY!!! You can imagine my disappointment and anger when I received this toy on 12/20 in the late afternoon (it was ordered 12/13 with rush shipment) as a Christmas present for my niece! The thing comes with 1 roll of film with only 6 pictures. Polaroid.com doesn't even sell the film, it is not available anywhere!!!!!! So, with only 3 or 4 days to go, I'm out shopping for a Xmas gift! AMAZON.COM AND TOYS R US, YOU SUCK, TAKE THIS TOY OUT OF YOUR STORES AND OUT OF YOUR WEBSITE. IT SHOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE TO ANYONE UNLESS YOU POST IT AS A DISPOSABLE CAMERA!!!!"
1,not worth the money,I wasted alot of money for a toy that could only be used 1 hour. My 8 year old niece kept asking for the toy so I bought it for her for christmas. It is now the middle of May and we still can not buy film. I also wasted money on film that did not fit but could not be returned because we opened it. This is sad!
2,Disappointing,"The idea of a personal photo booth is a good one, but this toy is disappointing. Following are our concerns with the toy.1. Not enough film comes with the camera (only 6 photos). Because of initial set-up problems, we only were able to get 5 to develop.2. The film is small, expensive, and difficult to find. The developed photos measure just less than 1 inch high by 1 inches wide. If more than one person is in the photo, you need a magnifying glass to appreciate the images.3. The images are very poor. Most images are streaked and unnaturally colored with an orange tint.4. The image that develops on the film does not match what is seen in the mirror.In summary, I believe this toy is a waste of money both when purchased and throughout its life due to the high cost of the film."
3,where do you purchase the film for this camera????,"I purchased this camera for my daughter last christmas, I used the one film which came with the camera and have not be able to use it since. Daughter loved it if I could find film. Checked Target, Toys R Us, Wal-Mart and the internet - izone 200 does not work with this photo booth."
3,"Great, but can't find more film.","I too bought this for my nieces. The first 6 phots were fun. They both loved it. But then I bought the izone 200 film and it didn't fit. The cartridge was larger than the little pack that came with the product. So, where do you get izone film that fits it??? Anyone have a clue? I wasted $45 buying izone 200 sticky film. The package instructions says you can use ANY izone film but that definately isn't the case. So, now my little nieces are very diappointed."
3,Film,"I have never seen this product in person, but I do want to check it out. This is to address film:I have an I-zone camera and have seen film at most drug stores (usually with a photocenter) or target. I'm sure you'd find it at a place like walmart as well."
4,great idea falls short with specail size I-Zone required,"My 8 year old daughter and her friends would love to play more with this toy but I, like other reviewer, have not been able to find the SPECIAL-SIZED I-Zone film that it requires. Leave it to Polaroid to confuse the market with more than one size of its already hard-to-find film! Signed, a frustrated but so far willing to wait purchaser."
1,awful,I got this for my then 8 year old daughter for x-mas last year and it was a huge waste of money!! The pics came out lousy and we could not get the replacement film in correctly and it ended up 'reaking!! Dont waste your time or money--purchase a cheap digital for them to use...thats what we did and now she can take it on field trips and to parties!
5,Girls,"I got this toy for Christmas it was fun until I ran out of film that it gave me in the box. Then I found out that they don't make that film anymore for some type of reason,so now it is just taking up space in the back of my closet. But it was fun it was fun while it lasted."
2,DO NOT BUY THIS TOY! FRUSTRATED MINNESOTAN,"What a super fun idea this photo booth is! My 8 year old had a great time with the first 6 pictures that it came with. Easy to load and operate. However, just like all of the previous reviewers, I too read the instructions which stated that it will take ""any i-zone film"" and ended up purchasing the i-zone200 film(because that is the only film available in my area)- which obviously does not fit this unit. Upon calling Radica's customer service, and airing my concerns, they have taken the position that their instructions are clear and that it was my fault I purchased the wrong film. I am very frustrated as it seems that the standard i-zone film is being discontinued from all the retailers in my area. My suggestion to everyone is not buy this product, as it was stated once before ""what good is this toy if you cannot buy the film for it."""
3,"Great toy, but can't get the film","My child loves this item, but it seems impossible to obtain the film. Also, the film is expensive--$20 for 36 ""sticker""-sized pictures."
2,Could not make it work,"Maybe it is human error but we love tapioca pudding but we, after two attempts, had to give up this product. Too soupy or tapioca balls were to hard. Again, this could be our error but we followed the directions and did not get the pudding consistency that we would like."
1,One long article that should have been in Jane magazine,Aren't we cute? Aren't we clever? Perhaps you could have hired someone who really knows somehing about cinema to help you out. Skip this one.
5,Show on Romance Classics Channel,"There is a movie-tv show on this network, it is based from the book, they show a movie to suit a woman's every mood. ""Cinematherapy"" is practically on whenever you want it. Anytime."
4,"Cute, funny reviews",This book was pretty spot on with recommending movies for certain times in your life. It also gave me a long list of movies that I need to watch. The reviews are humorous and insightful. Great selection across a wide time span.
3,"Good idea, poorly executed!","When I first saw this book on Amazon.com, I thought ""Wow, this will be a great gift"" So, I bought it and read through it before giving it to a good friend. I was somewhat disappointed in the fact that many of these movies were older, more obscure movies. Maybe that is the authors' point, nevertheless, I think it could use some more current entries."
3,Not too bad...,"This book was cute and had its good points, such as rating the movies with the best clothes and apartments and the cute little quotes, but it also had its drawbacks. First of all these girls are just a little too fond of the metaphor-they use it in almost every review and it gets annoying after awhile. Also they review entirely too many ""chick flicks."" I like them as much as the next person, but sometimes you just need a good action flick. Also they review a lot of old movies that are really hard to find. I'd have liked to see some newer ones. And finally, they criticize a lot of the movies based on whether they portray their female characters as strong or not. All in all, it was just ok, and I believe you'll have to try it to decide for yourself, but I do recommend their other book, ""Bibliotherapy."""
2,Too much basic,"This book is too much basic and elementary. The language is poor and little pleasant to read. The scanner mods are very explicit, but you can find similar on the net, with same results. The graphics are very poor, with bad resolution (sounds like a dratf). The topic about antennas is a little more interesting, but it provides little help with decimal system, because all formulas use inches and no convesion tips are provided. It's really a VEEEERY introdutory scanner book. You can find better information on the Internet. I didn't like it."
5,Axler writes a nail biter,I don't know what kind of spores the other reviewers have been breathing but I had a lot of fun with this one. I loved the the traveling road show idea and I loved the mountian lion. I would like to see more of him. The magus was way cool. If I had a bitch it would be that it was too short. This was another good one in a great series.I like the way that Axler builds up to confrontations. It seems to take a long time and every page is a nail biter. The more wacked out the Deathlands get the better the read.
1,It's OK to skip this one....,"This book can be documented as a lazy effort. True Deathlands content, connective flow was replaced by the use (or mention) of past characters. Trader? Come on. WHen /if he is brought back, do it in style, the real JA style. The Carny theme was OK but end it there. Why start a completely whole new and possibly exciting encounter like the fungus, just to have one member of the team turn a valve and save everyone. Had I not finished the book it would have been better. Time is limited at my household so I try to choose wisely what I read. This time I choose poorly. Will I read the next one? Of course, doubt it can get any worse.But this one deserves a 1.0. JA, hope your're reading this..."
2,Not what I expected or wanted,"It's a small almost pocket size book, the pictures are not of actual people but an illustration, the text has nothing to do with the art of foreplay and it did not spark much intrest in both myself and my partner."
5,I Loved reading this book!!!!!!!,"This book is great. It provides good information that can definately add pleasure, romance, excitement and intimacy to any relationship. It shows you and your loved one how to fully explore each other. My favorite part of the book was where it discusses erotic dancing and foods to use, like strawberries and whipcream(YUM!). It has many colorful illustrations. My boyfriend is so pleased he just ran out and bought me several more sexual books. This book is well written and easy to follow. I'm very glad I read it..."
1,What a joke!,"This so-called writer butchered a once-in-a-lifetime case. Instead of building suspense, delving into the characters' psyches and telling this riveting story, he merely wrote a few set-up chapters and then gave a blow-by-blow account of Capano's 13-week trial. Pathetic. Seemed like he took the newspaper accounts of the case and rewrote them, albeit poorly. If you want to read a compelling accont of this sick tragedy, try either Fatal Embrace or Summer Wind."
4,Very good true crime read,"I had the pleasure of working with Brian on the trial and was anticipating the many books on Capano. ""Above The Law"" is a quick read and Brian captures the bizarre testimony from the trial very well. I knew the entire case very well and still his book made me want to read more to see what happens, despite the fact that I knew already. I recommend this book for anyone interested in true crime and strange courtroom drama"
2,uneven and choppy,"As a fan of true crime books, I was very disappointed in this one. It bounced from one time period to another, rarely providing indepth coverage of any event or person. There were several typos, and the whole thing felt as if it were thrown together quickly. Save your money and buy the more popular books by Ann Rule and G. Anastasia."
1,"Jumbled, badly written. How can it be so highly rated?","All I can figure is that the readers who've praised this book did not read the other two available accounts, by Ann Rule and George Anastasia.""Above the Law"" is poorly organized. The writing is mediocre at best and atrocious in parts. Karem badly needs an editor!If you'll read only one book about this sensational case, by all means choose either Rule's or Anastasia's book. They're well worth the higher price."
1,"Let's get organized, Brian!","I made the gross error of reading an Anne Rule book just prior to this one. I only served to point out what a disorganized writer Brian Karem is. He could also use some pointers in grammar, as well. The book jumps all around in time, rather than focusing on a ""start to finish"" approach in recounting the crime. It was the most irritating read I've had in quite some time. You want great true crime? Anne Rules!!!"
2,No Insight,"Although ""Above The Law"" is a cut above the average rushed to press account of a notorious murder and trial, it really wasn't much more than an organized summary of press accounts. Now these do have their place, but for background, insight, depth of character, and a wider perspective, I look forward to the other books coming out on this subject, especially Ann Rule's. I hope I'm not disappointed."
2,"""Above the Law"" Below Par","While Brian J. Karem's account of the Anne Marie Fahey disappearance serves as a good introduction to the case that shook tiny Delaware, his writing lacks flair and imagination.For instance, the reader will have to wade through such unoriginal passages as, ""After Annie disappeared, Kevin Freel, brother to Ed and Bud, held a vigil at his pub. He had signs made up and posted them on the fence outside his pub. They said 'Friends of Anne Marie.' They hang outside his pub to this day.""Also, in referring to a detective's work, Karem writes, ""He said it didn't take him long to figure out that when Annie showed up missing, Tom Capano had something to do with it.""Either Karem was in a hurry to get this book out or his editor needs a refresher course.Although Karem is the first of four authors to get to print with a Fahey/Capano book, and he does score a few points by way of interviews with Capano's ex-wife and daughters, don't let his account spoil your interest in the others."
5,Fascinating,"In the same vein as ""Helter Skelter"" -- a good thorough look at the Capano Trial. I read other reviews that looked forward to Ann Rule's book. I do not. I read in the Wilmington paper where she only spent a limited amount of time at the trial. This book was at least written by someone who was there for the ENTIRE trial.""Above the Law"" has a reporters insight, and the knowledge of someone who was there. The chapter on Nick Perillo and Deborah MacIntyre --both loathsome individuals who had a part to play in this terrifying crime -- are worth the price of admission."
2,Waste of time,"I agree with the reader from New Jersey ""No Insight."" I also can't wait for Ann Rule's book on the subject."
1,give me my pillow,this book is a sleeper! i pushed myself to read til the 12th chapter and then i pulled my bookmark out-i couldn't even finish iti'll look for ann rules!
5,Fantastic book! Sad Case.,"I don't understand the criticism of the review who said the book was jumbled. This book follows a fairly straight course from the discovery of the cooler through the end of the case.It's like an arrow shot through the heart of the case and it pierces best and deepest when it brings the reader the insight of the workings of the trial and the strange characters who all had their parts to play in this macabre, bizarre tale.I was most impressed with the closing lines of this book; ""Robert Fahey said he and his brothers and sisters viewed the trial as Annie's last fight. It's nice to know Annie won it.""I've read the other books on this trial, and particularly found Ann Rule's quite distasteful. But ""Above the Law"" is better than all of them. It's like a locomotive gathering speed through each chapter and once you're on the ride you can't get off and don't want to.It's Great True Crime!"
5,GLAD I BOUGHT THIS BOOK,"This book gives a very good insight into Detroit's gangs back in the day. Although many books/videos are out there about gangs in general, I doubt that there exists any other such book giving details about 1970s and 1980s *DETROIT* gangs and even interviewing their members. Very unique.Gives a good background into understanding today's Detroit gang activities."
3,2 Hard To Get Albums Makes For Pleasure From The Buddah Group,"When you mix Moroccan rhythms and 70's rock you get this 1970's FM staple.Remastering left noise between cuts which makes me believe it was taken from a safety copy.Still good to have.Notice none of these songs made it to ""The Buddah Box"".Not for the faint of heart."
2,Gets kinda old.,"The problem with Rod Laver is that they get really old really fast. I think the main problem is that the singer TRIES to be a rapper, and it seems as if he is competing against the hardcore music that is playing.Instead of trying to sing hip-hop along with the hard core. Another low point is that there are like 6 songs on here that are just pure rap....and those are horrible. The only reason why I gave it 2 stars is because there are some songs that are pretty hard core. However as I said....the singer kinda messes it up. If you want AWESOME rap-hardcore get Seventh Vision or P.O.D."
1,Remastering errors,"Does anyone have the final word on the degree to which Astralwerks (sic) have screwed up these Eno 'remasters'?'Another Green World' has the first bars of 'Everything merges with the night' missing, 'Climate Study' is missing from 'More Music For Films, and someone below states that the intro to'Quartz' on this album is also truncated. Are Astralwerks just a bunch of amateurs or something? Eno must be well pleased with this mess.."
2,Another Mastering Screw-up,"The music here rates 5 stars, but be warned: the opening sustained note at the beginning of track 10 (Quartz) starts late, cutting off about half of the note. If that's not important to you, order away."
4,18 Technicolor Worlds,"'Music For Films' was my first Brian Eno purchase. It was a good choice, because it prompted me to check out many of his other works as well.The best description of the album I could give is that Brian presents 18 portholes into 18 different worlds that range from ethereal to downright eerie. It's perfect for late light listening in the dark with headphones.Recommended for any Brian Eno fan, or anyone who enjoyed the instrumental tracks on David Bowie's 'Low' and 'Heroes.'"
2,Lesser Eno,"I love Eno but this album is not his best. It sounds like any of the thousands of cheap new age recordings out there: lots of synthesizers that slide in and out but never really go anywhere. Anyone with a slide dial and a cheap casio can pull this one off. There doesn't seem to have been a lot of thought put into this one. Buy ""Music for airports"" ""Thursday Afternoon"" or ""The Pearl"" instead."
2,Edgy,"I have heard of Brian Eno for years, but never bought any of his music. And I think I'm glad I never have. His music sounds contrived and strained. It didn't sound relaxing. There are other artists whose ambient music is superior."
2,"Difficult, undeveloped ideas.","A collection of 18 pieces, some intended for specific films, some evidentally not, Eno's ""Music For Films"" is one of his most difficult ambient records. The music contained within this disc is moody and cinematic, but its also fractured. With most the tracks less than two minutes long, ideas often do not get the chance to develop to their fullness (""Aragon"", ""Alternative 3"").Having stated that, there is some fanastic material on here (""From the Same Hill"" with some great guitar/synth interplay, the Frippertronics piece ""Slow Water"", edgy and bizarre ""Quartz"") that makes it worth seeking out for fans of Eno. For the more curious, try ""Discreet Music"", ""Music for Airports"", or ""No Pussyfooting"" (Fripp & Eno) for a better introduction."
5,Unbelievable!!!!!!,"This book should be in every RV on the planet. If you are a novice or a veteran RVer this is the ultimate source of RV knowledge. Told with humour and experience, this book is a winner. The only thing I can say is buy it!"
5,Want to learn or extend your knowledge of RVing? Read this.,"The subtitle of ""Spirit of the Open Road is ""the essential reference guide for Canadian RVers"". Peggy has taken her love and knowledge of Rving and put it into an informative easy to read guide. If you don't even have an RV yet but are still in the ""I think this looks like fun"" mode you should read this book. Been around for a while and think you know all the tricks of the trade. I would be willing to bet that Peggy could show a you a few new ideas. There is a nice balance between ""I knew that"" and ""wow what a great idea"". My advice is to buy two copies. Keep one neat and tidy and loan it to your friends. The other copy will probably become frazzled and dog-eared from the countless number of times you use it as a quick reference guide. Whatever your level or frequency of Rving you will enjoy ""Spirit of the Open Road""."
4,This masher means business!,"Thanksgiving went off wonderfully this year, except for the lack of a serious, industrial-strength masher utensil.So, afterward I got on Amazon.com and vowed to find the heaviest, duty-est, unbendable, stainless masher I could find. It arrived today, and it definitely meets the spec. This thing is a potato's worst nightmare and is built to last 20 years. If I had an intruder in the house it would be a toss up whether to grab the cleaver or this thing (ok, maybe that's exaggerating a little). But I got what I wanted, a well-designed, high-quality, manly masher of vegetable destruction, and I am all ready for Christmas dinner now!Did I mention I just bought a second one for my mother?"
4,"Mash it, mash it good","I actually bought this potato masher to crush strawberries for canning, not to mash potatoes. For potato mashing, Cooks Illustrated actually prefers another style of masher produced by the same company; that masher is a handle attached to a metal plate with holes in it, rather than a handle attached to a wire squiggle. I didn't think that the plate with holes would work so well for crushing whole strawberries, so I bought this one instead.The masher made pretty quick work of about 8 cups of strawberries, so I'm pretty pleased with it. My only complaint is that the handle was a little uncomfortable to grip, but I think it wouldn't bother me as much if I were mashing something softer like potatoes. I usually make mashed potatoes with a potato ricer, but this would definitely be a good substitute in a pinch. The masher feels solid in your hand and I think it'll last a good long time."
5,Always been happy with WMF,Happy with this potato masher. I have other WMF tools and find them to begreat and last.Would recommend to a friend.
2,"Cute smiley faces, not my taste","The gumballs with the smiley faces look very cute in our new gumball machine, but unfortunately neither my husband and I nor my children like the gums... The taste is too artificial for us."
4,You don't need to be Christian to like this band.,"Ballydowse might be a Christian band, but you wouldn't even know it unless you read the other reviews. The lyrics aren't preachy, and they seem to be more of a liberal type of Christians than belligerent right wingers. At any rate they play a good blend of celtic folk (and even klezmer and aborignial on some songs) and punk style rock. In addition to the rock instruments they play fiddle, mandolin & bagpipes. If you like Flogging Molly, Pogues, Dropkick Murphy's you will like this band, Christian or not."
3,Many different sounds on one album,"When I first heard the single ""Aren't I lucky"" I absolutely loved it. It has a great hard rock sound to it that isn't too common of Christian female singers. Because of this one song I was interested in buying this album. Now that I own it I realize that Charity is experimenting with several different sounds. My favorite songs in order are Aren't I lucky, Drown, Bend, and Silent Boy's Dream. These songs all fit the funky rock style I was looking for. The other songs are pretty mellow but their growing on me. If you're sitting on the fence wondering whether or not to buy this album I'd recommend going ahead and getting it. It's cheaper than most CDs and the good songs are worth owning."
4,Christian Morisette (?),"Actually, I got this album accidentally. I was looking for another album that was coincidentally released on the very same day as this one... That being said, she has a good voice and the album has a diverse array of music styles on it. Sometimes she sort of reminds me of Alannis Morisette, but then again she can sound very ""sweet"". My favorite track on this one is: ""Aren't I Lucky""."
1,"What ""Powerful Evidence""?","They claim this movie provides ""powerful evidence"" that only God could have created these animals. Where is that evidence? Did the Big Guy sign their behinds? My point is that he tries to prove it was God becuase it was not evolution. He seems to assume those are the only possibilities; if it wasn't evolution, it must have been God. He doesn't actually provide evidence that God did it, he just tries to show that some animals could not have evolved. He doesn't actually do a good job of shooting down evolution, but the premise that ""God did it"" is not supported at all. BTW, this guy is a DENTIST, not a reputable scientist. This movie is a pseudo-intellectual security blanket for people who need an invisible sky-Daddy to tuck them in at night. Pure Christian propaganda."
3,A Strange Book,"...This story is about a kid (Marcus) and his mom. His mom rented the apartment on top of the garage out to a guy named Nick. Marcus's dad died awhile back, so it was just him and his mom. Nick and Marcus's mom were getting close, and Marcus didn't want another dad. Marcus found out that Nick had a son (Blake), but Nick hadn't seen Blake for years. Nick's x-wife got custody and disappeared with him. It is a surprising end and I didn't think that the book would end the way it did.The language in this story was pretty descriptive (Robbie plunked back down). The story is not very efficient and it drags on and on, it keeps talking about one matter and keeps going on about it.I would recommend this book to kid's that like short fast stories, but if you like long and very involved books don't pick this one."
3,Is anybody there,"I think this book was good. but it was bad too. it had good details, but the it dragged on about the same old thing over and over and over again."
4,Gripping suspense for elementary school students.,"Ever felt like someone was watching you or came home to find things rearranged? That's the creepy feeling that Marcus gets in ""Is Anybody There?"" The reader wonders along with Marcus who takes his key and eats his food. The suspense holds to the end and the surprising conclusion."
1,Too weird for me.,"What a weird book - when you start to read a romance novel, you don't generally expect reincarnation and time travel to be part of the mix. And when it is part of the mix, you'd expect it to be combined more artfully than this story was. A sad jumble of very sappy and wooden characters. Not very good at all."
5,Fun!,"I have the whole Turbo Jam series and this workout is by far my favorite. It is so much fun, the music is great and it really is a good calorie blast. I just wish it was longer."
4,Very fun exercise routine!,I really enjoy this exercise routine. It's fast-paced and fun which means I am done with the workout before I know!
2,German Warning: not playable on PCs or Macs!,"There's no mention of this in the description or by amazon (or its sellers), so I was really peeved when I couldn't play (or rip) the CD on my PC. That said, it's just a so-so collection, since BR were/are on Epitaph before and after these out-of-sequence Epic tracks; many of their best singles are absent (Recipe for Hate, Process of Belief, The Empire Strikes First, & New Maps of Hell), and even great songs from ""The Epic Years"" like Parallel were omitted. The live tracks' quality is predictably poor, though the 'session' ones are passable. At least I know which MP3s I need to buy, cuz this is useless as anything but a stereo-limited, incomplete greatest hits attempt."
4,Beautiful pictures of gardens - no garden info,"A beautiful book with wonderful pictures and many great ideas. I would have liked more written descriptions about the type of plants used. After all, the title says ""Garden"" I purchased two books and gave one as a gift to a friend building a ranch house in Mexico. She loved it."
5,Mexican Garden,"I chose this book to help give me some ideas as to how to "" Mexicanise "" my garden.So what with the yuccas, agaves & cacti i'm well on the way, just need to add more colour & fragrance to it.I also bought Mexicasa and Mexicolor."
5,Vangelis,I had heard a couple of the songs Vangelis had written for movies on the radio over the years and just loved them. I decided to order the CD for myself. I will sometimes play the CD during dinner for the soothing effect it has for the meal or while I am working on the comuter. One surprise was the last two selections on the CD. They are vocals! It was very unexpected but delightful at the same time. This is fast becoming one of my favorite CD..
4,"High quality sound, but the bonus below par","The sound quality is clearly better than of the earlier records, e.g. Themes, but it matters only, if you can hear and appreciate it. The bonus tracks No 17 and 18 sound like from another planet. It is easy to make you own compilation from tracks from various CDs using almost any copying software. E.g., a new compilation may include the tracks from Odyssey and Theme (in brackets [*]) No 1, 2, 3, [13], 4, 5, 6, [5], 7, 8, 10, [10], 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16."
2,"My wife would give it three stars, perhaps...","she said she liked this OK for driving to work music, and I used it for driving around town in the course of my job, but was not so impressed. I really have seldom liked electronic music, but this fella's theme for ""Chariots of Fire"" did hook me, and I bought the subsequent LP or cassette. Never paid attention to him since. I saw the movie ""Blade Runner"" and hated almost everything about it, including the music Vangelis created. Aside from the ""Chariots"" theme, ""Celtic Dawn"" and ""L'Enfant"" are pretty good on here, and are the only tracks I would want to hear twice. A friend gave this to me after it failed to impress him, and although he and I often disagree about music, books and films, and always disagree on politics and even religion, I am with him on this particular CD. Very repetitious and sporadically jarring is what I concluded, so I don't expect to be adding any more by him to my shelves."
2,Disappointing,"I like the music, but the sound quality is terrible. I bought this CD because it was released in 2003, but there is ZERO improvement in sound quality from previous older tracks."
2,Hip-O Records trying to make money from us,Hos this company dares to call this compilation definitive collection??? Bring something new and then I'll consider your work. Shame of you!!!
1,Oh What a Waste of production!,"Who ever allowed or approved the plan for Vangelis himself to Re-Master the music in this CD should be fired from his or her job on the spot. The group of songs in this CD is what made Vangelis world famous and lured me to love his library of music. But the sound quality? the dismal low volume recording on this CD? Please Mr. Papathanashu, stick with plans to write great tunes like you once did and put someone else in charge of engineering who knows what the hell they're doing. Skip it."
3,Lack of key themes,"This cannot be considered a deffinitive collection, because it doesn't have any songs or themes from ""Heaven and Hell"" and ""Spiral"". I don't believe ""Spiral"" or ""Cosmos"" haven't been included in this compilation and even after seeing ""Pulstar"" and ""Alpha"" from ""Albedo 0.39"" are included, so it was not a matter of author rights. Vangelis has been to many discographic labels and it could be a problem but it is not so because of the diversity of the material.So you should better fulfill this lack of songs by purchasing ""Themes"" or ""Greatest Hits"" (RCA), and there you can find, apart from these many other necessary themes to make an approach to Vangelis. If not, I would recommend buying directly ""Spiral""."
5,The best comprehesive book on the field,"Has a good style: * Gives clear decription of physics * Gives a good introduction to basic numerics * Clearly explains various techniques developed over the last few decades, and the incentive behind their development * Up to date, with many modern schemes"
5,Very Fun for Harry Potter Fans!!!,"This toy is great! Harry is durable, but the slime isn't. To make the slime last for awhile you need to put it in the refrigerator when you're finished playing with it. The cob-webs on the robe give Harry a new look! HAVE FUN!!!"
5,The Invisible Dimension of Human Attraction.,"Just because you can't see or consciously sense that something is there doesn't mean it isn't. This book is an eye-opening presentation on how pheromones can influence our moods, emotions, and desires. Although we normally associate pheromones with animals and insects, it is also simply a part of being human. Scientific experiments recounted within validate the effectiveness of the power of pheromones, and even the existence of a mysterious human organ -- the vomeronasal organ (VNO) -- which senses the pheromones that influence our behaviour. The other thing I like about Michelle Kodis' book is it shows a rich historical connection illustrating that humankind has always suspected that there was another sense beyond our well accepted five senses that influence human attraction. There is definitely something to this concept of 'chemical communication.'"
4,"readable popular science about romance, etc.","Kodis and her collaborators have hit upon an excellent, easily accessible blend of science and popular information - enough academic hard science to support the surprising discoveries reported, enough surprises and sexuality to keep most anyone more than interested"
5,Well Written,"This book explains it all, and is easy to follow. The book explains the core nature, and the cause and effect of the human pheromones without all the science bla bla's. All you need to know, is right here in this book. From animals to man kind, and how this animalistic scent effects our daily lives without evening knowing it is going on.Although as a spiritual seeker and non-new age psychic, I do not agree with some things in this book, do to the fact there is more than one thing involved with in comes to the sensory. But pheromones are at the core, since it is also part of the human energy field. What new age call aura. But there is also the energy field it self that can also give off such positive and negative information and emotional feel of those we can sense. Other then that, this book hits it."
