2,Big Disappointment,Every actor has a film that is a stinker but it is a shame that this is the last movie that Brittany Murphy did. I think she was a very good actress and I don't want to remember her in this film. It just was not her best work - not even close. I was very disappointed to say the least.
3,Crazy husband alert,"The movie itself was ok. What was disturbing was how awful she looked. She was playing a bank professional, so the look did not fit the role at all. It was distracting to see such a beautiful actress look so bad. I was thinking maybe it was drugs? Nope, Simon Monjack did her hair and make up for the movie. The failed writer/director/thief Simon Monjack was listed in the credits as hair and make up. Normally, I don't even watch that far into the credits but I had to see what fool had her looking like that. Unless he went to beauty school under one of the fake names he used to score pills, wtf? I have heard of a lot of husbands interfering with their wives careers but that takes the cake. I saw Tribute that she filmed right before and she was stunning. How sad her final role makes her look like a crack ho, very sad. I hope he rots in hell."
3,Good twists and turns!,"This is a Twilight Zone-like story of a young woman whose boyfriend goes in for surgery, but a few hours later, there is no record of him ever being in the hospital. We come to find out that she is not crazy, though, and there is much more going on than we, or she, had ever realized. Some great suspenseful scenes."
3,Farewell dear Brittany,"I was originally interested in watching this movie because it was Brittany Murphy's last. I feel bad that this movie that was dedicated to her showed that she was obviously ""not well"" when she filmed it. It didn't even look like her. Pretty Brittany looked sick, exhausted, like death warmed over and seemed like it was an effort to even get her lines out. I don't want to remember her that way. Rest in Peace Brittany, I will remember you for all your wonderful movies when you were a healthy beautiful girl."
3,Movie was GREAT!!,This movie was pretty good. It had a nice spin to it. I'm glad that I bought it at a cheap price because I wouldn't pay $20 + for it...I'm a bargin shopper anyways though.
3,OK,A reasonably ok thriller. At one point I wondered if the female lead character had lost it or not but at another it became a little obvious. Sad to say Brittany did look a little unwell although that may have been make up for the part I am not sure. For her it was a case of....gone too soon.
4,IS SHE A PYSCHO?,"Brittany checks her boyfriend into the hospital for routine out patient surgery. After a while he disappears without a trace. He is not in the hospital records. Brittany has a history of psychological disorders and appears to be unsure herself. Little by little Brittnay finds clues to convince herself she is not crazy and her boyfriend is real. She runs around the hospital in a frantic search as the staff try to catch her. Brittnay Murphy's doll face is in nearly every scene. The acting was good, the plot was so-so as the ""is it real?"" didn't carry through until the very end as the movie shifts from a suspense-thriller to an action-drama. If you enjoyed Shutter Island, you might want to check out this movie or vice-versa."
2,Very disappointing,"I was looking forward to seeing this film because I usually enjoy Brittany Murphys movies, but this was awful. I couldn't get past her appearance she looked dirty and worn out. She had on way too much makeup and blush she looked awful her hair looked dirty and tangled, you can see her black roots, the camera did a close up of her face and you could actually see the lip liner around her lips it looked so sloppy it was ridiculous. The actors were terrible in this film there were so many holes and unanswered questions I just couldn't bare to finish it. I gave it two stars because I like Brittany Murphy but who ever directed and produced this should be ashamed of themselves for allowing Brittany to look like this on film and in her last apperance none the less."
4,Gone To Soon............,"This is a remake but good anyhow. Brittany has made a few movies and no telling where she would have taken her career, to what level. Definitely, a work in progress. Make sure somebody stays with you at all times, while a stay in the hospital. Ha! A must to see and own."
2,B movie,"It is a shame that Britneys last movie was a ""B"" rated flick. I really liked her acting in ""UP TOWN GIRLS"" she did a good job. She was better than the script."
5,BEST FITNESS INFORMATION AVAILABLE,"The doctor/author is clearly knowledgeable and brilliant with regard to fitness and health. I read his book before it became so incredibly popular and have been more than pleased with the results I have obtained by following his simple yet well-reasoned principles. I feel younger and more fit and have gained insight into preventative care of myself and my loved ones. I highly recommend this wonderful book. And thank you, Dr. Katz."
5,All You'll Ever Need!!,"This is the perfectly logical, no nonsense book that I've been searching for for the past twenty years! Based upon the evolutionary principles that make us who/what we are, TBK fitness cuts directly to the point and illustrates what we need to do, in simple terms, to follow a sensible diet and bodyweight fitness program that will get the average person, (and beyond!) up to optimal fitness. Folks, your search is over. This is the one!!"
1,Read Eat to Live By Dr. Joel Furhman,"I was excited when I recieved this book, but that turned to disapointmen. The man may be a doctor but he knows little about nutrition. I have been eating the paleo diet for years without trying and have gained 100 pounds. He spewes a lot of good information. But what trips him up is the statement about vegetarian diets being ineffective is totally untrue.Get the book ""Read Eat to Live"" By Dr. Joel Furhman instead of this one. As a matter of fact you could say he wrote the book almost in response of this one. I believe he wrote the book including high amounts of meat woudl attract the type of idiotsthat believe in the protien myth!"
2,Very Weak,"Carlyle's last few novels have been rather disappointing in comparison to her first works. This last one is a perfect example. Very little character interaction, no suspense and, honestly, no story.When one reads her novels concerning Cole and Jonet, Elliot and Evangeline or Helene and Treyherne, their complex relationships that build and the danger/mystery in which they are involved, well, Giles and Aubrey's relationship is both unbelievable and boring. There is no suspense in any part of story, whether it be the relationship, who Aubrey is or the ""mysterious"" death. It's all obvious.The only interesting characters and aspects of the novel involve the uncle, the Delacourts, Kem and Max, and they appear too briefly. My advice is not to purchase this one new."
4,Very good story!,This is the third Liz Caryle book I have read and I am liking her writing more and more. A Deal With the Devil is a very good story with strong character development and interesting story line.
4,Nice Look At W2K3 Security Issues,"This is a nice book for looking at Windows 2003 security issues, from setup to configuration to a whole plethora of different topics that are associated with IT management of W2K3.Special examination is focussed on IIS, VPN, Active Directory, network resources, and security as a whole.Nice book for all IT people who want to improve their Windows 2003 skillset.**** RECOMMENDED"
4,Great for beginners or those just curious about bonsai,"Contains clear, easy to follow guidelines. Great pictures of trees, styles, tools, etc. Recommend for beginners or anyone wanting to know if they want to do bonsai."
4,Good basic coverage of the bonasi art,"This is a great book that covers the basics of the bonsai art. It's not the most thorough book, but it's enough to get you started and/or satisfy your curiosity."
3,Good Picture Reference,Very nice photographs. Good intro to the craft...but lacking a bit. (There is no mention on `stump chopping' at all.) Has a good tree reference/care at the end. It was my first bonsai book...It's a keeper.
2,OUTDATED CSI FORMAT-EVERYTHING BEFORE 2004 IS OBSOLETE,"THIS BOOK IS GREAT EVEN FANTASTIC IT VERY THOUROGH AND A MUST- EXCEPT THEY CHANGED THE CSI MASTER FORMAT CODE IN 2004 SO ONE OF THE BIGGEST REASONS I GOT THIS BOOK IS OUTDATED AND NO GOOD, I HAVE TO USE THIS BOOK IN TANDEM WITH THE 2004 MASTERFORMAT TO AVOID ERRORS. AND THE TRUTH IS I CANT FIND ANYBOOKS LIKE THIS THAT USE THE 2004 CODES- SO OVERALL ITS A GOOD BOOK"
4,Cultural Education,"Cultural genocide has surfaced it's ugly head many times in different places. However, Education for Extinction shows just how devastating this incident can be. It gives an entire new outlook to the ""help"" provided to native peoples during the conquest of this nation. Long have we been taught of Thanksgiving and the good that has come to native peoples, but this book tells the true tale, for what it's worth."
4,Education for Extenction,"Education for Extinction is a book about the Boarding School Experience of American Indians. The book is one that will bring you to tears, but it also shows the incredible resiliency of the children who endured the Boarding School Experience. This book is a true portrayal of the Boarding School experience; the good, the bad, and the ugly. This book gives you a harsh look at why Indian Boarding Schools were created in the first place and the connection between American Exceptionalism and colonization. I recommend this book if you are willing to take a harsh look at the oppression of American Indians."
4,A Glimpse at True American History,"I found Education for Extinction to be a well written, informative, yet fairly easy read. Adams' use of language created clear illustrations of the boarding school administration, the staff and the students. He was also able to capture the heartbreak and despair felt by Native American students and parents as their lives were forever changed upon entrance to boarding schools.Adams did appear to minimize the atrocities of events that happened within the boarding school system. Although he touched on some of the abuses that occurred, it appeared as though they were minimized, which I hope was for the benefit of the reader and not based on the subjectivity of the author.Education for Extinction provides a clearly written account of the near genocide of Indigenous People in America through indoctrination of boarding schools. A highly recommended read for anyone interested in learning true American history."
3,Pretty good book,This was a pretty good book about American Indians and the whole boarding school experience. David Adams really brought the experience to life. The only downside to this book is that I think he tried to cover too much. He covered a great span of time and the book was pretty long and got a little slow at times.
1,Uninspired genius?,"This is what the genius behind the music of Pink Floyd sounds like on his own...and it isn't pretty.His other solo albums are better than this one, but not by much. After all these years, I still haven't been able to figure out how the same man who wrote _The Wall_ was willing to make this uninspired, derivative (and now very dated) piece of work public. Perhaps credit for _The Wall_ doesn't belong to him alone as he would have everyone believe."
1,"Please Roger, no more solo albums like this, PLEASE...","I can't figure out what Roger was thinking when he put this mess together. I thought David Gilmour had an ok recording with 'About Face', nothing great just ok. Roger on the other hand records this mess and I'm sorry to say that I can't even say it is ok, it's just bad. Listen to me when I say that Roger and Dave do their best work when they are together in the studio fighting and screaming at each other over what works and what doesn't and in the end it is always perfect, some of the best music ever recorded.I don't think there is anyone telling these guys or challenging them when they are in the studio, someone should speak up and say, hey this is no good how about doing it this way. Imagine saying that to Roger Waters whose ego is bigger then than the earth itself. I know they will never get together again in the studio but hey it's nice to dream."
1,Not Recommended,"The video only runs about 20 minutes. It includes videos for only 4 songs. It's just not worth the $16 it takes to have it delivered to your home. Buy ""The Wall - Live from Berlin"" and at least get your money's worth."
2,Oops he did it again,"Well, I really want to love this cd, but it just doesn't work. the songs don't flow, and roger seems to be forcing it. I am not sure what he was trying to do with this record... and by his own admission I read that he said 'It was a failed concept, but I didn't realize it until it was too late.' I agree. HOME is the best song on the recording. but no worries, his classic Amused To Death more than pardoned this weak effort."
4,"Like all Waters/P.F., excellent music, mediocre lyrics.","""KAOS"" was the usual Waters treat for me; from him I expect excellent music, and can put up with the [mostly]absurd lyrics. As a result of the previous reviews on your website, I went to see ""In the Flesh"" at Darien Lakes, NY, last Saturday and enjoyed the evening tremendously. Clearly, the crowd liked all the old Pink Floyd stuff best. Clearly, Roger Waters liked his new stuff best, and I enjoyed everything. To me, ""Home"" is without peer among anything else he has written recently. Too bad he didn't perform it Saturday."
4,who needs information...,"This is my favorie Roger album. Sure it sounds a little outdated, but it flat out rocks more than his other material. Lyrically, it's second to none. Play it loud with sub-woofer!"
3,"Great concept, great words, but music has something lacking","Radio K.A.O.S is admitetely a great concept album, from Roger Waters who is not new to these kind of things. But one can instantly tell that there is something lacking, something which was present is his past band, Pink Floyd. The music is not extravagantly wonderful anymore. It seems a bit out-dated, which is a pity considering that e.g. Dark side of the moon (15 years earlier) is less out-dated at all, if not pretty timeless.So considering the efforts of Roger Waters without the music of Pink Floyd, we have a great concept in the old 'The Wall' style, but with some great music to complement the lyrics lacking."
3,"Alright, but could use a remaster","This album, though a bit dated in its sound, is good. However, like most 80s albums, it suffers from thin production. There is little bass, and everything else is just flat. If this album were remastered, or perhaps even remixed, it could reveal itself to be great. It would also be nice to have the tracks that were deleted from the album for reasons of time (LP limitations - which was really stupid in 1987, but that's the record industry for you) restored. These include Molly's Song, Going to Live in L.A., and Get Back to Radio (all of which were released as b-sides).So how about it, Powers That Be? Bring on a remaster!"
1,KEEP FAR AWAY FROM THIS,"I gave this one star, because I had to give it something to get to the body of the review. This is so bad, please stay way away from this. The premise is silly, the music is terrible. Roger Waters is a bass player. Where is he on this disc. The songs have no substance, no point, nothing musically. The social commentary is just self-indulgence. It is painful. I'm trying to stress this. There is nothing good on this. No reason to have anything to do with it. I love Pink Floyd. I do not understand this. I just know that I bought it used and 5 minutes into it, I ran out of the house screaming. Aside from the no music that is on this disc, the sound is dated also. So it is 1987 again. This ages badly. I begged the guy who I bought it from to let me exchange it. He did. Thank you, Joe, from Music Connection, Elmwood Park, N.J."
2,Silly concept album,"With Radio KAOS, Roger Waters hit rock bottom. (He rebounded nicely with Amused to Death).This is a silly concept album about a boy communicating telepathically with a radio station. Between every song is annoying talk between a typical top 40 DJ and the electronic voice of the boy. This interrupts any possible flow the ablum might have had. Some of the songs lack any melody and don't have strong musical arrangements to back them up.Even at his worst, Roger Waters is still a gifted song writer. There are two very good songs here and none of them are horrendous. I gave this ablum 2 stars because the talking between songs just makes listening to the whole thing generally unpleasant."
1,What the $#@!&% is this #$%@!?????,A completely horrendous failure in Roger's exploration of his pathetic egomania.
2,"Oh By The Way, Which One's Pink?","Back in 1987 Roger Waters and Pink Floyd had competing albums and tours. The winner was Floyd by a long shot. Sure, the Pink Floyd name carries more weight than Waters. However, Floyd did have a much better release. To be positive, Radio K.A.O.S. does have three good tunes which are ""Home"", ""Four Minutes"", and ""The Tide Is Turning"". But the concept here just sucks. Billy, a kid in a wheelchair, is able to pick up radio waves and launches a simulated nuclear war ala War Games. This is the type of CD you listen to once or twice, than you put it in your CD collection never to be touched again."
3,Live is better,"It's true that this album has problems (though about 30 seconds of the last track are among the greatest stuff Waters every did). I have some live bootlegs and I have to say that sadly the live versions of these songs are infinitly better then the album tracks. I think Waters would do good to release a Radio KAOS tour live CD, it could safely replace this one."
5,THIS ALBUM IS AWSOME!!!,"LET ME START BY SAYING THAT I AM A HUGE PINK FLOYD/ROGER WATERS FAN.EVER SINCE I HEARD THE WALL,I HAVE COLLECTED ALL OF THE PINK FLOYD GREATS.THAT WHICH INCLUDES THE WALL,DARK SIDE,ANIMALS,AND WISH YOU WERE HERE.WHEN I FIRST HEARD THIS ALBUM,I BOUGHT IT AN CASSETTE,BEFORE CD'S EVEN EXISTED.THEN I FOUND IT ON CD RIGHT HERE ON AMAZON.IF YOU LIKE PINK FLOYD,YOU WILL LOVE THIS ALBUM.IT TAKES A LITTLE GETTING USED TO AT FIRST,BUT YOU WILL DEFINETLY THANK YOURSELF LATER."
2,don't buy this one first,"If you are planning on buying a Roger Waters album, get Amused To Death and The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking first (unless you enjoy eighties music). They are beautiful, and this one is rather annoying eighties music."
5,"Great, a detachment from Floyd",tracks 1 and 4 are probabaly the most exiting to me...all the tracks meld together which gives it a unique quality. it is quite different from pink floyd so if u are expecting The Wall this ain't it but any floyd fan would and should listen to this album because it is a great album from a great writer
3,Far too 80s for me...,"Now I must say that Amused to Death is one of my favourite albums. So when I bought this I was expecting something similar. But it's not, it sounds a bit like Duran Duran or INXS. And I'm sorry but Roger just doesn't have the vocal skills to support that sort of music. Too many computers."
4,Very underrated,"Okay, so it sounds very dated. I happen to like the whole ""80s Pop Tune"" scene. Sure, Roger's voice does NOT belong in an 80s Pop Tune, but we can forgive him. We can't really forgive him for the presence of Paul Carrack, but his appearance is in a good song, so we can overlook it.The story is ridiculous. I guess this is as close to being silly Roger will get these days. But it leads to good lyrics and decent tunes. There are only a couple bad songs. The DJ and fake radio broadcast schtick is a bit annoying, but doesn't detract from the album too much.""The Tide is Turning,"" which is great enough to be singled out, is Roger's finest solo song. It even beats a good many of his songs with Pink Floyd. If they'd given the guitar a bigger part in the song, it'd be perhaps the finest song he'd ever done. If only Dave have made an appearance.Buy this; ignore the bad reviews. It's very good. Better than A MOMENTARY LAPSE OF REASON, at least."
1,The only KAOS is in Roger's songwriting,"This album is not quite as appalling as its predeccessor, the virtually unlistenable ""Pros and Cons of Hitchiking."" Nevertheless, it is still a trying experience. Strip away the fine instrumentation of Pink Floyd (Waters's former mates) and all that remains are leftist political ratings from a guy who must have ENJOYED reading Karl Marx's ""Das Kapital."" Not to mention the fact that the album's topical concerns (anti-Reagan, anti-Thatcher) are relics from the bygone Cold War era. We could hope that someday Watters will come to his senses and rejoin Pink Floyd. Alas, that hope is probably in vain."
1,"R. I. P., the glory of 'Pink Floyd'...","I HAD to write this review. I simply HAD to do it so the average rating of this album would be lower because there might be people out there who want to get some good music and they might end up having something like this... *shudders*It is very interesting to see that people have rated this album as either excellent or awful. It is interesting that there are people who rate this as 'excellent', that is... because I can't believe any Floyd fan could possibly even TOLERATE this album.It's 80's at their best.I sat there, listening to song after song, unable to believe Waters (the very same Waters who wrote 'The Wall' and 'Wish You Were Here'!!!!!) could ever have written something THIS bad. It IS bad, let me assure you once again.Don't say I didn't warn you if you decide to buy this..."
2,it's alright.,"the effects on the songs are dated,but even the songs themselves(lyrics,structure,background vocalists)just don't meld together well for me.I was expecting more I guess."
4,Waters's best solo work....,"I like Roger Waters's solo work a lot, even though his solo work wasn't as good as his Floyd recordings. This is my favorite of his solo albums, a tight, surprisingly uplifting concept album. The production is a little cheesy (it was made in 1987, and there are many annoying synthesizer lines), but overall it's very well written and made. I especially like Radio Waves, Who Needs Information (the most powerful song on the album), and the haunting closer, The Tide is Turning (after Live Aid). This album was released the same year as Pink Floyd's A Momentary Lapse of Reason, and this is the better one. KAOS didn't sell as well as Momentary, not even close, but I would still listen to this one over Momentary anyday. This is Waters's best solo album, and one that probably would have been a great Floyd album."
3,Waters' least powerful solo outing.,"...but it still deserves at least 3-1/2 stars! Recorded during Waters' nuclear-obsessive period of the 80's, Radio KAOS tells the story of Billy--a fellow who triggers a fake nuclear war in order to get mankind to wake up and smell the roses.The concept is dark, and the story is told through a series of conversations between Billy and a DJ on KAOS, a radio station in Los Angeles. The DJ is played by Jim Ladd, a real DJ from the (late) great KMET radio station in LA. While the story line is typical Roger Waters, it doesn't seem to succeed as well as other greater works--notably, Amused To Death, Animals, The Wall, or Pros & Cons of Hitchiking.The most glaring fault of this CD is the noticably dated recording...it sounds very 80's-ish.As I see it: This is 3 stars because it is not as good as Pros & Cons (4 stars), or the masterpiece Amused To Death (5 stars) recordings."
3,not his best,"Pros and cons is OK, with some great guitar work by a certain mr Clapton. Amused to death is even better, with the aid of a certain mr Beck. This one, however, uses no 'name' guitar player that makes us forget mr Gilmour. The compositions aren't very great, the synthesizer sounds are a silly attempt to modernize and the 'story' (such as it is) is a bit overblown, even by Waters' standards.What stands out for me are the great female backing vocals over all, used to best effect since Great gig in the sky on DSotM, The tide is turning (beautifully recorded and a great epic song) and Who needs information, which to me is the only song (apart from The tide is turning)where the synthesizers work.I own it and I would not want to miss it as I tend to be a silly completist, but in truth one does not need this album."
3,Some good songs on this radio,"The second of Roger Waters' post Pink Floyd albums is a mixed bag. On the plus side, there are four or five good songs on the album, some good lyrics, and some neat effects. The negatives are that the concept seems not fully developed, the sound has mid-80's drum machine qualities, and there are some tedious tracks like Four Minutes. I'd buy it again if I lost my copy, but it's not a masterpiece."
3,Just can't match the others,"Ill keep this short and sweet. The songs on here are pretty good and all Roger Waters fan should listen to this, but all new fans to his solo work should start with ""Amused To Death"" which will blow you away when you hear it, then the pros and cons, then this."
1,He's got radio waves coming out of his bum!,"Based on the theme of a boy from Wales going to LA, Radio KAOS is a real disappointment from the former bassist and sometime lead-singer of Pink Floyd. Who is that DJ? Shadoe Stevens???It just goes to show you that Roger was vastly incorrect in his statement that Floyd would not succeed with out him. Is this the best that he could do without them???Perhaps that janotorial position at KAOS is available for both Billy and Roger."
2,Hasn't this album been done?,"I don't want to accuse old Rog of Plagarism, but wasn't this album better when The Who did it and called it ""Tommy""?Seriously, Radio KAOS is about a DISABLED boy, Billy, who COMMUNICATES through an RADIO....hmmmm.....sound familiar?"
2,Hmmmmm,"I couldnt realy get into this album.I Tried and i tried but it just didnt happen.Thats the problem with Roger Waters music,you have to get used to it and perhaps i just didnt get it.I actually only bought the CD for ""The Tide Is Turning"".Man that is a good song,and thats how i gave it 2 stars.But honestly i didnt have the patience to give it a dozen or 2 spins.Maybe i needed to eject some funny stuff into my veins first."
2,i blame paul carrack,"i cant image roger waters truely enjoying this album. while the closing songs, home, 4 minutes, and the tide is turning are decent, they do nothing to make you forget the abysmal opener (radio waves), and the follwing succession of bad songs that just scream ""80s!"" and where in God's name was paul carrack picked up from? his singing on ""powers that be"" turns an already irritating song into an absolute disgrace. (And i dont even want to mention what he did to floyd songs on the tour that followed this album) another strike against kaos is the down right silly plot. as other reviewers have detailed, it involves a whelsh boy in a wheel chair who hears (what else?) radio waves! somewhere along the line, the kid (billy) leanrs to speak, and gets a hold of jim ladd, a radio dj. from there, billy goes on to stage a fake nuclear war with his semi-telepathic abilities. honestly, what was roger (whos other solo albums i enjoy immensly) thinking here? ...i'll just blame paul carrack"
2,Sex (a little) but no car chases..,"Book loaned by a friend who noted that I was a John Mortimer/Rumpole fan and who thought I might enjoy Inspector Morse. I am sure there is some grist there and other reviews are probably more valid than mine owing to my decidedly pedestrian tastes.The book started out with an interesting premise (but don't all mysteries?) but quickly wound its way onto a labyrinth of side plots, sub-narratives, and entanglements with, frankly no redeeming steamy sex (except when Morse and Lewis visit the strip tease show) or car chases to revive my interest.Our poor old C.I. Morse even makes several self-admitted blunders as he stumbles into the mystery's resolution.Mr. Dexter is a very good writer; I am just a very poor reader....short attention span and all that."
2,A confusing mess,"This book seemed promising at first, but got worse as the chapters went by. A poorly constructed plot with bland characters made it hard to stay interested. The seperate parts were not well connected, and it was hard to lose interest. Even the mystery was not intriguing, and hardly made me want to find out what happened. There was no action, and it mostly consisted of interveiws and dialogue with no real point. However, there were some clever lines that showed Colin Dexter has some talent. This was my first book by this author, and it will probably be my last."
2,"A disappointment, even if enjoyable at times","Of course I know the Morse television series, but this is my first Morse novel. I will have to try another one. This book is disappointing for the reasons stated by other reviewers, especially a plot that is excessively labyrinthine and, to be honest, not terribly gripping. The ending is also unsatisfactory. Dexter is not a great writer, but I'm sure he's done better work than this one. So I'm not giving up. But if the next one isn't good, then I will probably go back to N. Marsh and M. Allingham."
5,A little known treasure,"Years ago I ran across a copy of ""who Fears The Devil"" in a used bookstore. It contained 11 short stories and 10 one pagers. The stories, written from 1951 thru 1962, are about the travels of a man named John. The hero wanders the mountains and hills of the Carolinas with a silver stringed guitar.The stories rang from lost loves to feuds to evil people to monsters. The one pagers are great and could have easily been expanded into short stories. A kind of ""Twilight Zone"", ""Tales from the Darkside"" mix with a hint of H.P. Lovecraft. Even if John is there sometimes evil doer's have to pay for their sins. A book well worth adding to your collection and if you enjoy it be sure to look up the other John novels."
4,"Yes, but...","Wonderful stories by a wonderful writer. But take note of the intro -""The original stories were somewhat revised (Manley grumbled that this was done to give the collection some semblance of a novel)"". Which means some of the best lines from the opener, ""O Ugly Bird"", are gone. Still a good tale, but not the one that burned a hole in my brain when I was a kid. Overall, though, a great collection."
4,Very Funny and Thought Provoking,"I had the pleasure of performing one of the plays in this collection, and it was a wonderful read and a wonderful experience getting to portray some of the colorful, and in some cases, purposely colorless characters that are in this collection. This collection of plays gives a very timeless look into some of the many social problems of this country. If you are a theater director who is looking for something different, but very entertaining, I would highly recommend America Hurrah."
4,"Very useful little device, some flaws though","I bought this to use with a LP jam block on a metal snare drum. For just a small amount of money, this piece of equipment is very handy. It saves a ton of space by eliminating the need for an extra stand. It also helps keep the equipment close the drum head, making the range of motion needed to play smaller. It has a wingnut on it for tightening the rod, which works effectively.My one criticism - since it attaches to one of the lugs, it cannot be tightened enough for my taste. It still wobbles back and forth a little. If you tighten the lug nut more to eliminate the wobble, it tightens the head too much, knocking the drum out of tune. This might not be an issue on higher tensioned heads like marching snares, but for my concert snare drum, it is."
5,Encyclopedia of Bible Games for Children's Ministry,A great book with a wide variety of games. Different energy levels and age groups listed.
5,Encyclopedia of Bible Games for Children's Ministry,"Great book. Each game is named realtive to the Bible passage shown with the excellent instructions, so it makes teaching a passage and keeping the idea in the children's mind while having fun. It annotates the energy level with each game as well as providing a listing of items needed. Even has post-game discussion questions. Such a wonderful help to me!"
5,"Fun, simple games that all teachers can do","This book is a great resource for our children's ministry. It lays everything out very clearly and even offers discussion questions linking the game to the story. The only negative thing I have to say is that sometimes the game and the lesson objectives are a bit of a stretch. Other than that, it's great! There are a variety of games like high energy, low energy, silent games, and ice breaker games."
4,CUTE,"FROM THE BACK COVER:Bachelor of the Month--Tanner BlackburnThis irresistible rascal has earned a reputation for kissing women right out of their clothes. But he's never been accused of kissing them out of their fortunes, too...Would-be bounty hunter Maddie Griffin is desperate to prove to her father that she belongs in the family bail-enforcement business. So when she spies the notorious ""Kissing Bandit"" in Texas Men magazine, she decides to bring the charming fugitive to justice. Only, she has no idea how dangerously persuasive her captive's kisses can be...I read the book in one day, I really enjoyed it."
1,Don't waste your money,I've owned 2 of these. Both broke. The little doors on the side fall off. The whole cover falls off. This is only good for very light use.
1,Don't buy it,"What a dissappointing, unclear and abstract textbook! The chapters ill-prepare and ill-equip the student to solve any of the exercises. In addition, the book provides no key figures or key points for which a student can guide himself. It seems that the motive is to deliberately confuse the student and obfiscate the topics. In using this textbook, you are guaranteed to need supplemental textbooks, workbooks and study guides in order to get an adequate understanding (and how nice... they offer these items for purchase!). I really question the authors' intent and purpose given their unnecessary obscure approach to the topic. Stay away from this book."
1,WARNING -- This is not the full text!,"This is volume two of what I guess is a two-volume version of K/W's full book. If you are looking for the real thing, pick the OTHER K/W ""Intermediate Accounting."" The whole thing is a great accounting reference, but you need the whole thing, not just the second half."
2,Trying to teach yourself? This is NOT the book for you.,"Although the text is written at a relatively easy reading level, I do not feel that the content covers all of the details necessary to equip you to complete the exercises. If you have a professor explaining things to you, though, I'm sure it'll do. This is the new text chosen by my correspondence college. For Intermediate I they had the text Intermediate Accounting by Dykman, Dukes, and Davis. I am glad I still have Dykman's text so I can learn the material! If you are trying to learn Intermediate Accounting on your own, I recommend Dykman's text!"
2,Wordy and Vague,"As an accounting student, I was very disappointed with this text. It contained very little explaination of the problems given, and it was very wordy. I think it would have helped to have a workbook with worksheets for the very lengthy assignments, because I wasted three sheets of paper for one problem!! I found myself referring back to my old accounting principles book to figure how how to do the majority of the problems. Plenty of my classmates despised the text. If you are an instructor of an accounting department, do your students a favor, and find another text."
3,Looking at both sides of good and bad,"I think that this book is a good study guide. Only if you use an instructor led class. It is difficult but it is suppose to make you think. Right? Also, with the comment about the examples going the long way around the answer. To be a master at our profession, aren't we suppose to know every way? (Including difficult) I am only 21 and an undergraduate, and I liked the book (with an instructor led class to assist if I have problems.) It is not a good book to obtain if you are learning on your own. Not any answers in the back."
2,Keep you money and save a tree (or two),"As a student majoring in accounting, I have to say it's one of the worse texts along with many other terrible accounting textbooks in the market. The book is tedious, unnecessarily long, indirect, and badly organized. I still remember I had to bring this rock in my back everytime I went to class. The authors expect you the student would have all the time in the world to read all the unnecessary detailed remarks in the book and the main points can only be found after extensive diggings. If you're required to buy and read the book, serve your time. If not, save a hundred bucks."
1,Without a good professor don't buy this book,I had to use this book for both parts of Intermediate accounting. This is the worst accounting books ever put on the shelve. What made it really bad was that the professor couldn't work out the solutions either! This book doesn't even have a glossary. If you don't have a GOOD PROFESSOR who is willing to help you understand this book then my advice to anyone out there is don't buy it.
3,Challenging,"This book is definitely a tough one to read and interpret at times. The problems at the end of the chapters in this book were extremely difficult and at times I felt some subjects could have been explained in a less complicated manner to aid in better understanding. I have much more confidence after completing this book, that I am prepared for the real world of accounting. Please note that this book also has a web site where you can get additional problems and check figures for the problems at the end of each chapter. I would also recommend the study guide, there is a summary of all the chapters which is written for much easier reading. The problems in the study guide are a lot easier to work, and aid in working the problems at the end of the chapters in the text book. I will definitely keep this book for a reference after I graduate."
2,Unnecessarily Difficult to Understand,"As a university-level accounting teacher, I initially was stuck with Keyso & Weygandt because it was the book that many teachers use. My students had an enormous amount of difficulty understanding it, due in large part to gaps in the authors' logic. As a result, I initiated a search for a better Intermediate II text and eventually settled on that by Dyckman, Dukes and Davis. It's not perfect, but it is substantially better, and my students' complaints immediately ceased."
1,This book illustrates why so many students drop/fail acct.,"This text is tedious, disorganized, and not to mention, very expensive. Unless its required for your coursework, stay away - very far away from this textbook. There are thousands of other books available that cover the same topics included in this text, but in a much clearer and easier to understand fashion."
2,If you don't need it don't buy it!,"Having just finished the 1 year course as an undergraduate, one thing has become abundantly clear-this book sucks! The organization, writing and weight of the book could all be improved. There must be somewhere out there a better intermediate accounting book. I found that more often than not my instructors were telling me to ignore the methodology of the text. The text makes the material much more complex than need be."
1,$100 down the drain,I am taking this course independent study to help prepare for the CPA exam. The examples of problems within the chapter are too basic for the exercises at the end of the chapter. If someone is getting this book as a supplemental book for the CPA exam don't bother because it is a waste of money.
5,Best shoiw ever,"Never has their been a show like this and never will it be again. Scott Bakula and Dean Stockwell are perfectly teamed,the writing of Debra Pratt,Chris Ruppenthal and Paul Brown is legendary. I wish so much that the other episodes will be out on Prime and most of all, if Universal ever releases these on DVD in HD that they restore the music, the heart beat of this show."
4,BETTER THAN EVER,"SINCE I PERSONALLY FIND SO MUCH OF CURRENT PROGRAMING UNACCEPTABLE, WE ARE ENJOYING THIS SERIES VERY MUCH. THEY ARE JUST AS GOOD NOW AS WHEN THEY FIRST CAME OUT. THEY RECYCLE SO MANY THINGS, HOW ABOUT THIS?"
1,thrilled and disappointed,"Thrilled to see another of my all-time favourite series make it to dvd!Disappointed (more like horrified and disgusted) that they didn't bother to keep the original material - the music was an integral part of the series. My favourite scene was Al dancing with his wife to ""Georgia on my Mind"". If that's been edited, there's no point in buying it.Disappointed that this is what the studio chose to release - all 3 seasons of Due South I've purchased came with the original tracks (I also own the music cd's - that has to have been expensive for a small Canadian series to track down, but they did it). The price was higher, but I'll pay full price for the real thing.Unfortunately, I won't be buying this one - I'll be looking for someone to record it for me instead.(To the marketing wiz who decided this: lots of people may watch the show, but only FANS will BUY a series on dvd - fans expect to get the real goods!)"
2,Could have been great.,"I read about the music changes, and figured I would give it a shot and buy it anyway. Unfortunately, since I had seen most of these episodes 15+ times apiece the changed music is so distracting as to completely ruin the enjoyment. They should have just removed the background music when they could have instead.I can only imagine why they removed so much music. But I bet it all comes down to the greed of the RIAA. Greed to the point where, IMO, it just about completely raped the entire season of QL episodes.I really hope that, if this debacle doesn't kill sales to the point where they don't even consider releasing season 3, they don't mangle the music again.I would have paid an extra $25 for the season if they would have at least not screwed up the M.I.A episode. I am crushed."
3,Quantum Leap fans screwed yet again,"First network execs tried their hardest to get the show canned when it was on the air. Now we have to put up with crap from Universal editing out music? Even if you put that glaringly stupid move aside--they promised bonus materials in print on the jacket when there are no bonus materials. It's one thing not to put such features on there, but to lie about it on top of that?! Outrageous and completely inexcusable! What will they ruin next if fans don't speak out very soon and very loudly!"
1,Unacceptable!,"I'm sorry, but if Universal is going to willfully release a sub-standard product, then the least they could do is warn me before I drop $45 on it. I am so upset I can't even say. I feel absolutely cheated by this DVD set. What does Universal have to say for itself? I mean - it's not like they didn't make the movie ""Ray"" - so don't tell me they couldn't afford the licensing for the original music for MIA. They're just being cheap and downright sleazy in my opinion. And what's with promising bonus material on the box and then not delivering it? Isn't that false advertising? And isn't that illegal? I want my money back."
3,WHAT THE ??????,"quantum leap has been one of my all time favorites, but to release these shows with generic music tracks has been a great injustice to both the fans and to the show itself .in the original airings the music played a very important part. it set the time ,place ,and era of where sam was that week. generic 6o's b-movie tracks just don't cut it.(unless your of course in a 60's b-movie) i hope the studios fix this in season three and maybe later redu season two the way it was supposed to be"
1,This is NOT the original TV show,"I buy ""complete"" TV series because I want the COMPLETE TV series! This is NOT complete - this is the video part of the TV series with different audio. If I had know in advance that the original music had been deleted, I never would have bought this. Talk about feeling ripped off! I won't make that mistake again with Season 3. Thank goodness I still have my copies on VHS I taped off of TV."
1,Missing disk,"I purchased Season Two from Amazon for my son for Christmas. It has TWO copies of disk 3, no copy of disk 1. And I agree with the others who said the music was not original."
4,You can get the music from Real Rhapsody,"I would give the show 5 stars, but the DVD set only deserves 4 because of the lack of original music. I bought season 2 despite the lack of original music and special features because this is still one of my favorite TV shows, and if I didn't buy it now, I might miss the chance forever. That being said, if you have a subscription to Real Rhapsody, you can get most of the music they cut out of the episodes, including ""Georgia on my mind"". It took a little time, but I plan to have them playing over the DVD when I watch it. Thank you very much to the reviewer who posted the list of songs!"
3,"Love the series, HATE TE BOXED SET","Well im a DVD Series collector, i got all friends seasons dvd's and love them, cuz i got me a sony 5 disc player so i put them all at a time and watch the whole season, but this !@#%!#$@#$ it comes in double sided DVDs WTF, my 5 disc player its useless cuz i have to watch 1 disc take out turn it and go again, this is what i hate of this boxed set, and this repeats on 3rd and 4th seasons, and i bet will be the same thing on 5th one.As for the music, well i dont have a comparison point cuz i watched the series over tv and thats the only thing i got, one run thats all, as long as the havent cut video im good to go whit this version.Regards"
4,QUANTUM LEAP SEASON 2,THIS SEASON IS EVEN BETTER THAN THE FIRST.... MORE ACTION AND DEALS WITH MORE ISSUES etc.
4,Oh Boy,"You would probably have to be a fan of the original show to be ordering these. After watching them again, I realized how corny some of it was, but it is still a great show. The DVD's leave a little to be desired as the audio isn't always well matched up with the video, which was quite disappointing.But, again, if you are a fan of the show, you'll appreciate the DVD's."
3,Bonus features??! I see no bonus features!!!,"I am a huge QL fan and although I don't like the fact that they did a Lucas on S2 and edited the soundtrack somewhat, I am MORE upset at the fact that the box clearly states there are bonus features on the B side of the last disc... But there aren't any!!I also don't like the fact that they used the cheesy double-sided discs. These types of DVDs usually don't keep integrity of the things on them as well as the single-sided ones. I sure hope they do a better job on S3 as I really enjoyed S1.Another note about the music... The only episode that really ticked me off was MIA as the music set the mood of the scene between Beth and Al."
3,"Quantum Leap, a Great show but an average DVD","I just picked this DVD up yesterday and was excited by what I hoped it had to offer. Although it is loaded with all the second season episodes, but as other critics have mentioned there are no extras. I am so happy to be watching my old favorite show again but I wanted to have commentary and extra features.Universal, I hope you get your act together for further discs. I will also echo a concern about the empty pocket that seems like there should be a booklet in there. I was really looking forward to a great booklet about the show but instead get the lonely looking pocket. Was the DVD box maker asleep on the job? This is a bit of a scaled down rip off but at least there is the great episodes of Quantum Leap to enjoy.Shawn"
1,DO NOT PURCHASE,"Quantum Leap is probably the best show ever. HOWEVER, the DVDs are no good. DO NOT PURCHASE. It's not even worth it. The music is all wrong and the leaps at the end of every episode are all out of order. WAIT until Universal coughs up the bucks to do the set RIGHT!Universal TV Distribution100 Universal City, Plaza #3030Universal City, CA 91608(818) 777-1000(972) 293-5903"
5,Top 5 TV Shows Ever,"I loved Quantum Leap Season 2. It's a great example of wonderful Television. It wasn't affaid to tackle issues such as sexual harrassment and many others. The show has two very talented cast members Scott Bakula and Dean Stockwell. The reason I say this is because the both of them can act very well. My favorite episode of season 2 is Good Morning, Peoria. I can't say any thing bad about the show except when they looped the song Georgia On My Mind Played by Ray Charles in the episode M.I.A. Otherwise another wonderful season of Quantum Leap."
1,Sub par double sided DVD,"My favorite series of all times. I'm disappointed with season two for all the above reasons, and POOR QUALITY DVD PRODUCTION. The double sided DVD plays poorly on both my DVD players. I've had to return four copies because it freezes partway through and then hardly runs at all.How about pulling all the poorly produced DVDs and reissue it on single sided DVDs."
4,For want of a Ray Charles song...,"I would just like to say ditto on everything that has been said about this DVD. Indignant outrage after having reached the end of my Quantum Leap Season 2 journey and NOT finding any bonus material has led me to the computer at 2:30 in the morning EST to write the first review I have ever written on Amazon.com. But despite my rather violent views on the subject at this time, I have to look on the bright side and say that, despite there being no bonus material, despite the music being changed, and despite Universal royally screwing up what could have been a simply glorious DVD experience, at the end of the day, I still get to see Scott Bakula in tights.And if all else fails, I can play ""Georgia On My Mind"" in the background on my stereo.But seriously, Universal should be ashamed of themselves."
5,Word for Today,I bought my daughter this Bible a couple years ago and really liked the commentary by Pastor Chuck Smith so I decided to get myself a copy too!
2,Normal,For some thing that cost that much. I expected it to be awesome.It had a few side notes. No diagrams.Get the ESV study bible.
5,What a blessing!,"A joy to read! Chuck's comments on practically every chapter have given me a better understanding of God's ways and His deep love for mankind, and me personally. I also have experienced a better understanding of myself and what God requires of me as a Christian. Chuck has a wonderful way of making The Word come alive, real, and applicable to my life today. It challenges me to want to be all that God wants me to be."
4,Very Solid Product,"There were cheaper chairs located, but this one looked to be the cheapest of the ""next tier"" of chairs. I was very pleased with what I got. Looks sharp, feels solid, and was easy to assemble.Thus far, very pleased. Only gave 4 stars because I'll have to use it a while before determining whether it earns that 5th star."
3,Thin considering the length,"I was hoping for a thicker gauged cable but it does the job. Considering the length of 15 feet, it should be thicker."
5,Wow! I was blown away by this book,"After reading ""The Soul Tracker"" I could hardly wait to start this one. I really wish I had the talent to put into words how this book stirred me. Everything in this book I have been taught Biblically. As I read it, it was like all the things I ""knew"" were happening before my eyes as I visualized what was happening. The symbolism was just fantastic. Myers portrayed our doubts, our fears and gave them texture. But he also gave our hopes, our trust and total dependence on God a life all their own. As the different colors & lights & darknesses were moving like turbulent clouds and sunlight, you could see how all our own day by day struggles are the same. This book was just fantastic and I know I will go back & read it again and again."
5,Explorers Revealed,"Teachers and intermediate aged students will find this book full of interesting information about many well known explorers. What they won't find are exaggerated claims, found in some social studies text books, of the bravery and importance of well known explorers. Written in interesting prose, each chapter of this book reveals the foibles, faults and mission of an explorer. A valuable resource for teachers, this book will help balance dry, older or current textbook writing that rarely hints at the darker side of history. Students will be surprised by the human qualities, both light and dark, of these historical figures. This book provides information but allows them to make up their own mind about the importance of these explorers' role in history."
4,8-10 page bios on the explorers,"This book contains short biographies of 8 important explorers who ""discovered"" the Americas. These are ideal for the teacher who wants to know more than the textbook. This is also an excellent resource to use in class for students to learn more about the explorers. Students could use this resource in order to create ""baseball"" cards about the explorers. Or simply to use for students who want to know more about the explorers they learn about in class. The map inside the front cover is one that every student should have in his or her Social Studies notebook."
1,False sale price!!!!,The original price is listed as $109.79 and the sale price is listed as .75 cents. The savings is listed as 99% off. Therefore I assumed I would be getting the 200 pack. I received one Incect Repellent Towelette. Who in their right mind would pay $109.79 for one Insect Repellent Towelette? I'm upset that I paid .75 cents plus $2.75 shipping for one Insect Repellent Towlette. This is false advertisement.
1,Lid doesn't stay on,If the lid would stay on it would be a nice mug. Issue I have is the lid fall off easily.
4,Terrific Metal/Ska/Soul record,"This is a really diverse record, but all the songs are solid and some are briliant. Personally I prefer the ska of ""ma and pa"" to the more metal-oriented songs. It's a transition of style from ""Fishbone"" and ""In your face"", which were more uptempo ska/punk. ""slow bus movin'"" is a witty political song that really cooks. Kind of like the stuff they'll do later on ""Reality of my surroundings"". You should buy their eponymous debut first, then move on to ""Truth and Soul""."
5,If I could....,"I would give this cd 10 stars. Fishbone, from go, have been that intense band that EVERYBODY needs to experience. With all of that energy on stage and can still hold the beat! This is the ORIGINAL line-up for the 'Boners. I TRULY miss everyone else (with the exception of Angelo, who continues to hold Fishbone). Even Dirty Walt is gone. I thought he would never leave!. Fish (drummer) is now in Wicked Wisdom with Jada. Kendall's group, Seedy Arkestra, has a cd called Puzzle. Reggae-ish. Nice and mello. Walt has a cd called Dirty Walt and the Sanitation. Funky and dirty. That's all I will say. Rest of the fellers, yo no se? Favorite songs: Slow Movin' Bus (Howard Beach Party), Change, Freddie's Dead, Bonin' in the Boneyard,-Damn, might as well just say the WHOLE cd!"
4,Good album,"I think this is a pretty good album. I like 'unique' sounding bands, and these guys are that. They also can pull of a variety of styles of music, which is cool."
4,"Okay, not Fishbone's best","It is definately not my favorite fishbone cd. It reflects on its time of the 80's which is fine, but some songs has a 'cheesy' feel to them...hence the 80's. The self titled album, and in your face is much better than this. But it still is fishbone...AND fishbone has always been ""red hot""!!!!!!"
2,Couldn't even finish it.,"I managed to plow through 2/3rds of the book and finally dropped it off as a donation to the local library. Tales of Clark Gable were interesting, but way too much about way too little of too many of the people he was chatting about."
1,bring on the empty horses,this book arrived in terrible condition...it was actually torn in half ...all the binding was cracked/broken and pages were falling out....i threw it away
5,Find this book and you'll read it more than once!,"This book and the one preceding it(""The Moon's a Balloon"") just might be my two favorite books, EVER. I practically insist every friend I make read them. Niven had a very unique life, and had a rare gift for story-telling that makes these books real treasures. They are laugh-out-loud, effortlessly funny stories that tell us of his entry into Hollywood (an unusual career path, it involved prohibition, fish and polo) as well as his checkered career in the military in England. I guarantee you'll read these two books over and over again. I just wish he'd written more of them!"
4,Great shovel,"This is just what I was needing a push shovel. It does the job when I need to move a lot of snow, also works great with the light stuff."
3,Wrong part # here // this is 3/8 fuel line clamp not 5/8 heater hose,Amazon has this listed wrong. Spectre 2268 is a 3/8 fuel line fitting(set of two) not for 5/8 heater hose. Didn't get a chance to try theproduct so giving three stars to stay middle of the road.
3,Great patience needed,A decent product.It took nearly 3 weeks to arrive though.This should be made clear from the very beginning of the ordering processes.
2,Philips S-video?,"I bought this from ClearAV but it clearly is not the cable shown in the picture and it is not Philips. It is however, a S-video cable, black in color. Bait and switch - perhaps. I will avoid buying from this vender (ClearAV) in the future.When I order an item that says it is Philips, I expect it to be Philips. I also expect it to look like the item pictured."
3,A Disappointment,The product itself came in good condition but this turned out to be a compilation of six episodes from the series... 3 from each season. I thought I was getting a movie or a set of different episodes.
2,Book condition when I received it,When I received the book the binding was falling off and the book was coming apart. Not what I expected- but I need the book so I will use it regardless. I do understand the book was used but I have bought numerous used books and none of them were received in the manner that this was received. Very disappointed.
5,Found Memories,This book is a great resource for projects in art for children. You could say that I was the test subject for a lot of what's in this book. Willard was my grandfather. This book is a treasure that every elementary school teacher should have. My grandfather would take me to the university to work on projects and then put them in the book. What fun that was. Share this book with your children as my grandfather enjoyed it with his son and grandson.
3,For My Art Class,"I'm using this as a textbook for one of my undergraduate art classes. The book seems well put together. I like the layout and its easy to read and follow the instruction for the various activities. Overall, I like it."
3,Interesting view but not very convincing,"I hoped this book will give me more solid response to questions I had about the soul, mind etc but I think it is more like anthromorphism. There are assumptions that seem to be taken as definite such as closed end cosmolgy, separation of body and soul or mind which is controversial. The idea of soul is mainly built upon collapse of wave function or rather conciousness. I was intrigued that when a robot tests something it could be registering of both results ie, the wave function does not collapse if it is a robot doing the measurement. there is proof of uniqness of the soul in the creation, that is difficult to comprehend i read it many times but the result is interesting, there goes judea-Christian belief and comes Buddha. It is a book that you should read back and forth many times and contemplate, it is worthed and also read Descrates Error."
3,A lot of old and inaccurate info,"This book is not worth the money. You're better off getting a list of all the schools in your vicinity online and then going to each one's website, or better yet, go to mommypoppins.com. I wish I had done that. In just my section of Manhattan alone, two schools have changed locations and one closed since the last printing of this book which was in 2007. Had I known that I wouldn't have wasted $19 dollars.I'm going to refer to mommypoppins.com after all."
2,Mostly just a survey,"This book is comprehensive but really isn't much more than all info pulled out of the schools' catalogs. It proposed to be an insider's view, but there's nothing here you couldn't read in one of the school's own promotional materials. fyi."
5,An Excellent Resource for Parents!,"Victoria Goldman's Directory of Nursery Schools is essential reading for any New York City parent who is about to embark on the nursery school admissions process. An earlier reviewer criticized it for not critiquing the schools, but I think that is it's strength. It's a guidebook. It provides a description of each school and will help you narrow the choices of nursery schools to which you might want to apply your child. Read the book, then go visit the schools yourself and come to your own conclusions. You will find it extremely helpful, not only to help you get a feel for each different program, but it provides contact information, ages when children can apply, how many kids are accepted each year, and more (all in one place!). I've found this book to be more thorough than the materials provided by many of the nursery schools themselves. I highly recommend Victoria's guide. Karen Quinn, author of The Ivy Chronicles"
1,A joke,"I have to admit, parents who buy books like this are the ones I love to make fun of the most! This book is ridiculous, people, send your kid to preschool or don't, but don't pay $20,000-$50,000 a year. They do NOT feed into any better elementary school and your kid probably isn't smart enough to go to an ivy league school anyway. Love your kid, don't railroad them into your fantasies."
3,Great for the price,"Got this set at a grocery store for 5 bucks, and you can't beat that deal. Unfortunately what you get on this set are some of the worst Hellraiser films ever made. 3 and 4 are ok. 7 and 8 are terrible. Six has it's moments (mostly seeing Ashley Laurence on screen with Pinhead again), but 5 is the real gem in this collection. Scott (Emily Rose) Derrickson manages to bring new life to the Hellraiser series with Inferno, which is the third best entry behind 1 and 2. Image quality is pretty good on the discs, my only complaints are the fact that Hellraiser 3 is neither the uncut version of the film nor widescreen, and Hellraiser 4 has some audio issues (a weird echo on all of the soundFX and music tracks, that becomes really annoying). I noticed the same sound issues on the Halloween triple feature dvd release by Echo Bridge. But like I said, for the price it's a must have for any Hellraiser completest."
3,Quantity over quality in this case,"As a previous reviewer mentioned, the first three movies of this collection (Hell On Earth, Bloodline and Inferno) look great even with Hellraiser III being full screen. The picture quality on the other movies in the set isn't too great, looking sometimes grainy and stretched. This was truly saddening in the case of Hellseeker. The audio seemed fine on all of the films.This may just be a hang up for me, but I was bothered by the lack of subtitles for any of the films."
4,Well written but boring,"I'm a fan of old movies, and like most old movie fans, Eve Arden is a favorite character actress -- the perpetual best friend. Her TV series, Our Miss Brooks was also a winner, although the thrust of the show was to catch a man and get him to marry her, not very PC today.Although Ms. Arden's career was very important to her, it was her relationship with her husband and family that made her write the story of her life. Her two daughters were adopted, but other than that interesting tidbit, her family life was pretty ordinary. She glossed over her husband's alcoholism, and it didn't seem to affect either her or her children.Ms. Arden seemed to enjoy the family and the travels abroad as the best parts of her life. Those things were certainly written about with the most feeling."
1,A LOT OF HEADACHE - DO NOT BUY,"I purchased this set a few months ago. When I received it, EVERY ONE of the forks were messed up. I think they were having trouble with their cutting machine that day. The tips were uneven and SHARP. Well, I called Oneida and they DID replace the forks. When I got the replacements, one of the NEW ones was like that. I would assume this is a common problem. For almost a hundred dollars, I would expect this to be in good shape. Also, the utensils are just TOO BIG and THICK, not easy to use at all. I am very disappointed with this purchase."
1,Oneida still not making the FORK correctly!,An earlier review mentioned the forks not cut right at the tips.In my case they are not sharp but cut flat and even (no sharp tips). What's most embarrasing is I also bought a set for a family member for Christmas... You can't eat with the forksas they don't stab the food!! ZERO stars!! Get the cheap set back out...
4,Wonderful read,"I thought this novel found a way to wrap everything up nicely from the preceedeing novels, yet still leave the readers wanting more. Mrs. Kurtz delved into her characters lives masterfully again, and it payed off completely. I loved the way everything came together, and the heroes were able to overcome. I also liked the way she accurately showed the ""villains"" points of view, so they seemed less ""evil"", then just simply prejudiced and wrong."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"The Church vs State fuelled war that began in the previous Deryni novel continues here, with the king out at the head of an army, trying to put down an anti-Deryni uprising.While he does that, his advisors are looking to come to some sort of compromise with the church, diplomatically and religiously so that they can concentrate on stopping the violence."
3,Just OK,"I received my Oneida Satin Sand Dune stainless today. Fortunately, my service for 8 and service for 4 do match. It looks nice enough however is not very heavy. I found myself trying to bend it but it was strong enough to withstand the pressure I applied. If I had to make the decision today I would definitely buy the set at Costco, there is no comparison in the quality."
2,Not what I expected,"After all of the rave reviews I was expecting a higher quality. The design is very pretty, but I had expected it to be heavier weight. Not bad quality for the $49.99, but I was expecting $160.00 quality. The good news is returns are a breeze."
5,Sand Dune Flatware,"I found the value exceptional compared to dept. store prices, I highly recommend this flatware."
2,Not quite what I had expected,"It is extremely difficult ordering online when you have not already seen the product in person. We had hoped this Oneida product would be better than the last product we bought because we were paying more. However, the actual product did not look or feel as good as the online picture led us to believe. Suffice it to say that silverware is one of those things we will not order online again."
3,Not worth $160!,"To tell you the truth, I was planning to give this set as a wedding present--a set worth $160.00 as a gift--not bad, right?The set is definitely not $160.00 quality--it looks like something I could buy on sale for $20. I think Amazon misprices some of their merchandise--for example, on Amazon, I saw a Mikasa dish as being quoted as being worth $130.00 but being sold for $10--when I actually went to a Mikasa store, the WHOLE dish set was being sold for $130, not that one dish! Very misleading! Therefore, be careful when trying to bargain shop on Amazon--don't be mislead by the original price tag they give you."
2,Now Doctor Who Free!,"I've made the complaint before that many of the Virgin Who novels are lacking in the Doctor. ""Birthright"" most hold the record for the least amount of Doctor Who involvement; he doesn't show up until the very end! Okay, I know you have to read the novel ""Iceberg"" to find out why he's missing in this book, but that sounds like a cheat to me.There's also the mystery of who the old man at the end of time is. I sure don't know, and it really bugs me! Ace is grumpy, Benny is groggy, and the whole thing is solved in a very off-hand manner."
3,"bad read, good illustrations","Purchased this paperback in Italy for its illustrations: good color quality, included close-ups. It was also light and easy to carry as we searched on foot for Caravaggios. Ended up being a very disappointing and even frustrating read both stylistically and in terms of content. We'll be purchasing Catherine Puglisi's Caravaggio now that we're back home. I most definitely wouldn't have purchased this after coming home but it served its purpose over in Italy."
4,Not really what i wanted,"It works great so far..i bought it to play NWN2 but its still not good enough...oh well, thats the last time i trust the forums..always stick with the sys requirements on the game box. Yea..seems like common sense doesnt it lol.Plays all my other games great."
1,Fast Delivery for a PaperWeight,"Received the card just days after I delivered it - very quick delivery. I should have been weary when it came in a static bag, inside a USPS Flat Rate Box (Not the Mfg Box as displayed here). Installed it into a PC and installed the drivers. Immediately received a code43. tested it on two other PC's - same thing.Code 43 is a windows code for hardware failure.Basically, this card is just a nice looking paperweight.Not happy, and for the price -it's just not worth the hastle of paying shipping to return it.Lesson Learned - always buy new - otherwise you never know what piece of junk you will get.First and Last from THIS buyer."
1,No indication how much you are buying,"I am ordering black channa dal, but I see no indication on this product description of how much I would get for the price - no ounces, no indication how big the package is."
4,Lovely,These were a Valentine's gift for my daughter who thought they were lovely. They are delicate and seem well made
5,Master the Basics of English Grammar,"I found this book to be the perfect reference guide for basic English grammar, style, and writing skills. Its concise presentation and well organized approach to the rules of English grammar make this book a pleasure to use. The numerous written examples used in the book to illustrate the various grammatical and stylistic rules were very straightforward and clear, allowing readers to immediately incorporate these rules into their own writing. I recommend this handbook to anyone seeking to learn the important fundamentals or refresh their knowledge of English grammar and writing style."
5,English Grammar,"I liked the book, all of the lessons were easy and acceptable including exams - I'm very happy to have found this book - thank you for the refresher course!"
4,long time back,It was a while back when I got this book still trying to master it. Great book a lot of information. All I have to do is pack it away in the old brain.
5,Incredible low tones for downtuning that cuts through perfectly,"I'm a pro player in a melodic metal band using a pick. I tune down to G#,C#,G#,C#,F# and these strings work better than anything else I've tried including Elixir, DR, Dean Markley, or Fender. The strings are wound tight so when I downtune everything a half step they don't feel like it in my fingers so the strings don't get caught up when I pick fast. The sound is comparable to DR Silver Stars and the price is about half as much. I use an Ibanez neck-thru with active EMG's. With these strings it's a match made in heaven."
1,This never worked!,"This product did not work with any of the ipods I own. I bought it to use in the car to play my ipods, but it did not work. I did not return it because it was priced low enough that it would not be worth the hassle. I do not even know where the item is now."
2,Eh...,"It gets the job done, but the sound is not even close to the quality of the actual iTrips. I bought this cheaper transmitter after dropping my iTrip, and it's definitely worth the price. There's also a faint high pitched sound for most of the play, when it's set to any station. It works, but not as well as other similar products."
1,Could not use it,"Unfortuneately, this FM transmitter was not compatiable with my iPod Video and I returned it"
1,Discontinued for good reason,"Completely useless. Only shows a digital display when Ipod is ""fully charged"" -- how long does YOUR Ipod stay fully charged? Even when showing digital display doesn't actually broadcast. Maxell replaced it with the p-4A for a reason. Amazon shouldn't even be selling this, it makes me distrust Amazon. I got it as a Christmas present but it was bought in October so they won't even take it back.Follow up: After I emailed Amazon, they issued a complete refund, which they refused to do over the phone. Now they just need to pull the product, since they (probably wisely) aren't carrying the P-4A and therefore can't recommend it as an option."
5,Great DVD,"This video is great! I love the fact that it comes with an accompanying cd when I'm not in the move to keep my eyes open. Either way, they work. Granted, there is some effort required, such as having to pay attention to the beautiful scenes and soothing music...but that isn't very difficult considering the high quality of the images and sound. The music is somewhat repetive, but I guess that's the point, isn't it? I think it's great that there's actually a variety of options in terms playing the music and nature sounds. Also, the choice of playing it once, repeating it once or continously is a great feature. I really have nothing negative to say about it. I highly recommend it."
3,Night scene images and sounds would have been better,"This is a really good DVD, but considering that it's meant to help people sleep, maybe the video should have had images of nature scenes at dusk or evening time instead of all of them in day time. It would have been really awesome to see some starry sky scenes or a campfire outside and even hear the fire crackling, a few owls, and the crickets chirping too. :)For what it is though, the nature scenes are really nice and I like the options of being able to play just the music or nature sounds alone versus together, and I also like the continual play options as well. It runs through different chapters though and it would have been nice to continual play maybe one chapter that is a favorite, like maybe just the oceans, versus continually running through all the chapters."
2,call of the wild,My dogs went nuts when the coyotes (or wolves?) started to howl. Needless to say no sleep for me!
4,A Nice Little Excursion As Well,"Inspector Montalbano is back with a new murder to solve and like the previous Camilleri novels in the series there's always more than just the crime to get wrapped up in and around. The Vigata police are an interesting bunch and as Montalbano and his crew go about solving the big and little crimes that land on their doorstep they do so with typical Camilleri flair and style. The plots of these books are never all that simple to figure out but Camilleri brings us along as he gives us yet another slice of Italian/Sicilian life for us to chew on. This book is an excursion with the witty, clever and insightful author acting as our tour guide.Hop aboard. It's worth the ride!"
1,Not a pleasant 'excursion',There were some interesting facts in the book---- mostly about Italian cuisine and a bit about Italy. The rest of the book was a cross between a simple mystery and slapstick humor of the vaudeville variety. And the book never figured out which it wanted to be. I finished the book simply to find out whodunit and even that seemed to be added on at the last minute with no build-up. Mish-mash is the best description.
4,Another good mystery,"We've read several books in this series, which is translated from the original Italian. This is similar to the previous ones; good plot development. Montalbano is an interesting character, as are the detectives. Enjoy the references to Sicilian food - all from the sea. I just wish the language wasn't so ""salty."""
2,A Disapointment,Maybe the translation took something away from this book. It seemed disjointed and hard to follow. There was very little character development and sometimes there were people introduced who seemed to come out of nowhere. The ending sounded like it was made up at the last minute.
5,Good wire,"Wire was the style that I wanted, which is different than what I could get locally. It has a flat profile instead of round."
1,Andersen's Worst Book,"The hero of this book is so incredibly judgemental, antagonistic, overbearing and such an all-around unpleasant person I couldn't finish reading it. Any woman who would involve herself with this jerk is either a glutton for punishment or has lost her marbles. I have read every book Andersen has written, and take my word for it: give this one a pass and look for SHADOW DANCE instead."
4,Entertaining!,"I enjoyed this novel. The interaction between the characters was believeable and humorous. The murder sub-plot was interesting, too. I had no idea who killed Crystal until the end. I look forward to reading more Susan Andersen books."
4,The Texan and the Lady,I enjoyed this book even though it drags in some chapters Enjoyed the fact there were three story lines contained in this novel
3,Doesn't Smell Right,"I originally purchased this perfume at macy's a couple years ago. It had a very strong smell to it which I liked.Which is why when my bottle ran out - I purchased this bottle.I recieved it promptly which was shocking because usually Amazon finds the longest agonizing shipping method available to them and sends it out which means you will get it in a month... I got this in 8 days.So I got this bottle and I've worn it twice. I noticed that the smell is the same when I smell it in the bottle- but not as strong and it doesn't last a long time when I put it on - versus my previous bottle which I could smell on me all day.There are several sellers on here who sell this and I am not sure which one it came from - but i have the feeling this is not a legitimate bottle of Gucci, or Gucci is really watering down their perfume. Keep in mind the packaging what the brown cardboard and shrinkwraped - but who knows..."
5,"Hard to find, still as awesome as before!",I was so sad when Gucci discontinued this scent and I couldn't find it anymore. When I found it here I just had to have it. Not disappointed!!
2,Disappointed,Very disappointed. Each time you turn on the recorder the volume drops to mid range and if you wish to record a message you must hold very close to your mouth and then you can only hear it if you hold it against your ear. If you turn the volume up and try to record then it picks up all the noise around you and you can not understand replay. I am very unhappy with my purchase. It did not live up to its description.
4,Filter Cartridge,I am always happy with my Amazon purchases and this one was no different. However one has to make sure that the right cartridge size is selected as the Whisper Bio-Bags have changed their sizes. The regular is now Large and the Junior is now the Medium. Double check your whisper size requirement as I now have 12 cartridges to find good use for...no biggie I'll always have use for Whisper cartridges at this price...oh by the way EXCELLENT PRICE!
4,genius,"This product is exactly the same thing as the one that comes pre-filled, except you have to cut open a plastic bag and dump in the carbon yourself. It is stupid proof and way cheaper! I don't know how this type of filter cartridge compares to other types tho. But it seems to work fine."
1,misleading,"The picture of the box has a different size than the actual product so you may think you're ordering a large size but it is really a junior. When you say that the wrong product was sent, you are told that you were sent what you ordered... The picture is misleading."
1,misleading produce description charts from Whisper,"I bought them for my Whisper EX-20 Filter. They don't fit them. I had to purchase the next size up. Those don't fit also! The problem is the bottom of these are flat, while the bottom of the EX filters are curved.In order to use the Large refills, I ended up buying the Classic Whisper 30 Filter."
5,Worth the money,I always get these I have 2 turtles and lik 9 fishes of all kind yes the turtle ate some fishes but this cleaned it up
5,Perfect,"I have been buying this product for the past few years. The economy pack is cheap and lasts me almost a year, very easy to put together. Couldn't ask for better :)"
5,Great,These work awesome in my Tetra Reptile Filter for my turtles! They last longer and a cheaper!! Great buy for anyone who uses this type of filter.
5,So much better priced!,"This is a God send! For those of us who have aquatic turtles or ponds know its so hard to keep them clean! I did some research on different filter additions and this one seemed to be the one that stuck out of the crowd. I bought it hoping it would save me some money on filters, as well as the activated carbon ( I like to add extra ) and this has saved my sanity! Normally buying them individually is a pain and so expensive. But know that you get ONE filter set up and some of the bigger tank filters take two. So you have to buy at least one extra filter to make enough to fit the filters!"
4,not if you have too small a tank for cheapie goldfish,"It seems pointless to pay more to buy these preassembled, since it doesn't take any effort to change the filter pocket and pour in the charcoal. But if you have goldfish, they clog up quickly. Rinsing them every week or more is pretty gross. Of course, I probably have too small a tank and it wouldn't be as big a problem if I doubled my tank and filter size. Goldfish create a lot of waste product for their size.Re: the person who wonders about mold or other yuckies that could grow on the frame - the tank isn't sterile, it develops (hopefully) a balance of organisms, so you don't need/want to clean things out completely most of the time."
3,"Page Turner Plots, Good Characters, Poor Science, Terrible Editing","No doubt that the three books of this series kept yo on the edge of the seat. Time just flew by Forests of the Night and Emperors of Twilight. Nohar the protagonist of the Forests of the Night was someone you can feel for. Unfortunately the editing was really bad (I am talking about misspelling of words that altered the meaning of the sentence at key points). the editing was awful for all three stories.Other things that could have been better:1- The real movers and shakers behind all of the troubles on earth and all of the horrible wars, could have been very different. I felt it was an easy way out. There is plenty of fodder for other types of evil doers that can be legitimately ripped from today's headlines.2- The author bothered to create a detailed time line that was way too ambitious which created credibility gaps. He should have moved the timeline out a few hundred yearsnonetheless the read was engaging"
4,"Great camera, excellent photos","Though limited in storage capacity, this camera takes excellent pictures. I took a picture while on bus through the front window at the lowest resolution (VGA for emails) and the photo was clear in detail and looked very good. The best image quality(4 MP) allows a maximum of 8 photos for internal memory. A memory card gives greater capacity."
1,terrible,"This product is a connector for 2 regular ethernet cables, not crossover like it is suppossed to be."
4,"Good product, should have gotten sooner.","This is a great mobile, has lots of settings and the baby can turn it on and off. I waited till my son was 8 months old and I think that was too late. He likes it ok, but it doesn't help him sleep or be happy sitting in his crib alone."
4,The baby loves it.,"I like this product, other than the fact that the remote is kinda useless. I wish that you would be able to use the remote to turn on the mobile anytime you want, but it only stays active for like 10 minutes tops and then you have to hit one of the buttons on the actual mobile for it to be able to be shut off or on with the remote. But, the baby really likes it and she usually falls alseep within the playing time of the song and it's not much needed. I haven't used the remote at all."
4,"Great mobile, doesn't fit on crib","I really like this mobile. There are 4 music choices - all of which sound nice. And, the mobile has lots of bright colors, which attract the baby's attention. There are also options for increasing the volume, turning off the motion, and turning off the light. My only complaint is that it doesn't fit on my son's crib (Babyletto Modo Crib), so I had to attach it to a short chair instead. My son can look at it when he's in his bouncy seat. I've heard that mobiles can hinder sleep when they are attached to the crib, so I'm not too worried about having the mobile as entertainment for my son in his chair instead of on his crib."
3,peek a boo rainforest mobile,"I was so excited to get this for my 2 month old! I got it and put it all together and got it running and then noticed that one of the leaves kept getting stuck! so i tried adjusting it a little bit, thinking I did something wrong. Well I have had for over a month now and it still sticks and wont go up down like the other ones do unless u push it down then it will work for a brief second then quit! VERY irritating especially when u pay over $50 bucks!!!!! My baby doesnt know that all the leaves are suppose to drop and raise at the same time, all he knows is tht he likes it. It is nice because u dont have to wind it up every couple of minutes! All in all it is nice and my most important my son likes it! I should of sent it back but I guess i didnt want to take the time"
5,dundeemarie,My little grandson just loves this mobile. The leaves going up and down and the bright colors are a winner. My daughter got this for him where they live in Massachusetts and when they came to Florida for a visit I got one too!
5,My son loves this mobile!,"This mobile sends him off to sleep every time. I love that the music lasts so long--with the wind up ones, he would just start to settle down when it would shut off. There are two volume levels; usually the quieter one is enough for bedtime. My only (minor) complaint is that the remote control for it makes a loud clicking sound when you press it (enough to make him stir, but not wake up)."
2,Junk,This mobile is absolute junk! From day one the thing would stop spinning at times unless you tapped it to start again. Now after two weeks the only thing it's good for is playing the music. It doesn't spin at all now. Very frustrating when your 3 month old is captured by it as she falls asleep and then it quits working. So disappointed!
3,horrible noise,"I love the concept of this mobile. However, from day two mine has made a horrible noise when the gears are opening and closing the leaves. I seem to be getting bad luck with Fisher-Price lately because I also ordered a play gym around the same time that ligths up and plays music by Fisher-Price that only worked for about a month.I'd probably give 5 stars if I didn't get a lemon."
4,Adriana is happy with her Musical Mobile!!!,"This Musical Mobile has been an excellent choice for my baby. She really enjoys it: sounds, lights and movement!!! Music selection is wonderful, however, volume should be a improved to a little more higher than the one it is sold nowadays"
4,mobile,"We really like this mobile. So does my 6 month old. There is a lot to look at and we like the choices of music/sound. One thing we wish the mobile had is a small light in the center so our son could see some of the animals a little better. But all in all, it is great!"
4,Love Love Love IT!,"Got this as a Gift for my 1st baby, and now my 2nd baby having it @ his crib (we have this almost 2 years and still in good condition). Good quality from Fisher-Price, beautiful melodies that enchants my LO to sleep. Remote isn't working well sometimes, but no big deal about it. Definitely a GREAT GIFT for any Newborns!"
1,Motor stopped working after 3 months,"We read the reviews for this product and noticed that some people had listed mechanical problems as one of the primary risks for this product. We ordered it anyway thinking that many of the reviews did not encounter the problem and that we may therefore be okay. I can assure you that this problem occurred rather quickly with casual use on our part. We play it for our 4mo old son before he goes to bed on most nights, but certainly not all.This problem having shown up so quickly with casual use on our part make me suspect that the quality is inferior for the drive mechanism. The music and speaker portion still work.Overall, the quality of this product is obviously lacking and you should be aware that you are taking a reasonable sized risk when purchasing this product that the drive mechanism will stop working. You have been warned."
5,Wonderful product,My son is 2 years old and he still use this to sleep every night. I would buy this again and again and this is perfect for a rain forest nursery
2,good while it lasted,"this mobile mesmerized my son..until the motor broke and it stopped working after a month...I'd pick a more expensive model if you want one that works well, i would however recommend the rainforest soother!"
2,my baby was frightened of the animals!,"My daughter was 4 months and she found the bug eyed creatures frightening so I put it away hoping she'd grow into it but again at 7 months, she still gets worked up over it. Why cant they make the animals smile vs. have bugged out eyes!"
3,Decent product but not worth the high ratings so far,"This crib mobile definitely attracts our baby's attention and helps him relax and sleep often.Pros:- Decent value for the money.- colorful and attractive- Easy assembly and installationCons:- Not loud enough in the rainforest mode- All tunes are dull and sleep inducing. At least one of them could have been a bit peppy- Requires 3 D Type batteries. That's way too much. (At least it hasn't required replacement so far)- The lights are not visible unless the room is completely dark- It will play for 18 minutes and then stop. It's neither continuous nor customizable- Our baby stopped watching it after 2 months. May not be useful after 4 monthsGiven a choice, I'd give 3.5 stars. Sells at a premium because of the brand and new parents' anxiety.Planning to sell it on amazon marketplace or ebay, since it was used only for 2 months"
3,"It s OK, could be LOUDER!","I just got this ""musical"" mobile for my son, it was a gift...(cant complain about that)because it complemented my rainforest theme....but its pretty low on volume, it s not the batteries cause they re brand new..i guess the volume only goes that high..the room has to be completely quiet to barely be able to hear the tunes....i thought it would do more like blink a light but no, all it does is flap the leaves really slow as it sloooooooooowly circles around the little critters...even the ""light"" is barely visible..anyway..i think it could have been better. Overall i give it a 3 star cause its ok, not worth the 35 dollars, 15-20 dollars might have been more appropiate."
4,Great Mobile for Twins,"Bought 2 sets of these mobiles for our twins. Works great, keeps them in awe of the rotating animals and the leaves that wave up and down. Good selection of sounds from Mozart, Bach, Bethoveen and Jungle; wish there were more."
1,does not fit,cute looking but doesnt fit on our crib. nowhere did i see on website that it may not be compatible with all cribs. our crib is also brand new. the top bar of the crib where the mobile should be mounted is either to thick (the lengthwise bars) or graded (the widthwise bar). the box did say it may not fit all cribs but how was i to know until i tried to install it.
4,Baby Stuff,My daughter loves this mobile. The characters are so cute and the motion of the leaves keeps her interested in it.
5,Excellent Mobile,This mobile works great. Both the music and the bright colorful animals get and hold our son's attention and he still enjoys it after 9 months. We used any combination of the three songs whenever he would go down for a nap during the day and the 'Rainforest' sounds whenever we put him to bed for the night. Just one more thing we did to help him differentiate night time from nap time.We ended up barely ever using the remote as most of the time our son would fall asleep before the time limit on the music would end but it was nice to have at the beginning when he would occasionally take longer to get to sleep.Even though he stands up in his crib now and pushes the button on/off this is still securely fastened enough that we don't worry about him getting it off his crib.
2,Child loves mobile but two were defective,"Our daughter loves the mobile, she laughs every time the peek-a-boo leaves open to reveal the animals. Unfortunately both mobiles that we have bought have failed, none of the music buttons will work except the forest sounds. The sound is also very soft."
4,Does what it's suppose too!,The mobile moves perfectly. The leaves open and close and the animals move around in a circle. It is very heavy and must be attach to a crib with slates. I'm just concern about the batteries. It seems to drain them quickly.
1,Fisher Price Rainforest Peek A Boo Leaves Musical Mobile,I ordered one mobile and it had a defective motor. I then returned it and ordered a second one of the same thing and the second one was worse than the firstI always like Fisher Price. I understand this one has been replaced by something similar so they must have had a lot of the same problems.
4,a very beautiful toy,"I like this mobile, the leaves moving up and down, the animals slowly moving around. this is lovely, with soft music for baby, and even a little night light. This is a gorgeous exotic looking mobile. It is pleasant to look at and always catches my sons eye.This does run on big batteries, not included. It requires some assembly. I was able to put it together :) must have a philps screwdriver.The music is ok, but none of the music is listed under the correct composer, that isn't a serious problem at all, but something worth noting. Mozart plays bach, Bach plays Beethoven, Beethoven plays Mozart. This is a good quality product, just what I wanted, and I think i love it more than my son does."
1,Doesn't fit,"I was very disappointed when I went to attach this mobile to my crib and it doesn't fit! The attachment is meant for small railings, so if your crib has a lot of wood trim, do not buy this! I'm sad because it's really cute otherwise."
3,Not Loud Enough,"This is very cute, and matches our son's room. I was excited to see the new Rainforest Line. However, this mobile is not very loud at all. The music is ok, but the rainforest sounds are very quiet. I'm sure that the baby can still hear it, but it seems so quiet. I am returning this and getting the Nature Sensations Mobile instead. I had high hopes for this and was disappointed.EDIT: It is lound enough in a quiet room - the speaker points down to the baby so that he can hear it fine. Also, some other reviews says it turns on randomly in the middle of the night. Well, we figured out it was the baby hitting a button on the light portion and turning it on that way. When our baby did that, it was a good thing because he was squirming anyway - but if your baby did it in his sleep and it woke him up, that would be bad. I would change my rating to a 4 now after we've used this a while."
2,wish I would have paid attention to the reviews,"Like many other reviewers, our mobile had issues with spinning after a few weeks. The music played and the light worked, but when the parrot got to a certain point in the rotation it slowed down to a snail's pace for about a third of the rotation. I called Fisher Price and they were willing to replace the defective part. However, they wanted me to ship it to them before they would send out a new part, which they said would take 5-7 weeks (which was way too long to go without one for our then 3 month old). So I had to pay for a new mobile and wait to get a credit for the defective one. Almost immediately the new one also had issues and one of the leaves stopped flapping. This was a fairly minor issue but still frustrating."
3,Beautiful but has a major design flaw,"Received this as a baby shower gift to match the jumper and floor gym we registered for in the Rainforst theme. My husband and I were very excited and went to attach it to the crib railing only to find out that it does not fit properly. We thought that if we just tilted it a bit that we could secure it safely to the crib. Which we were ultimately able to do. However, it did not seem very secure since the mobile was leaning and was not sitting flush on the railing; we ultimately removed the mobile due to safety concers and to our deep disappointment it left two deep scratches on the crib. You would think with the popularity of convertible cribs that Fisher Price would of considered that when they manufactured this item. As a reference for anyone considering this item the clearance between the screw bolt and the lip of this mobile is approximately 4 inches. Regrettably, I will have to replace this item with another mobile that will fit our crib"
5,love the nature sounds,I chose this mobile to go with frog themed nursery. I love the sounds that it has with it. The nature sound is my sons favorite sound to sleep to. It is on the quite side and you cannot hear the motors at all.I've had it running for a week and love it. The remote works great also so you don't have to walk beside the crib and risk waking the baby.You might need some help putting it together it's not hard to assemble but it's easier to have help.
1,I am only giving 1 star because it doesnt work,We ordered this one because our son loves the swing. We just put it together and the sound and light do not work
2,Disappointed for lack of info,"Kinda disappointed and thought this can be used for my daughters Graco Crib. Turns out that this device can be used for a wooden crib. So, beware."
2,"If my baby didn't automatically love it, I would return it","I received this product today. It was a bit tedious to assemble (took me about 20 minutes) and is too heavy for the location I had originally hoped to put it in. I was unable to attach it to the back rail on my crib and had to instead put it on a lower side rail, which is fine until my infant gets to be a little more mobile, and then I will either have to lower the mattress to keep it out of his reach or remove it.I would have packed it up and returned it all together, but when I put the baby in the crib to ""show it to him"", he cooed, watched the animals, and fell right asleep. Since it was such a pain to put together I will probably keep it and just sell it when he gets too big for it to work."
4,Not what I expected,"It works well but not really what I expected. When I saw Peek-a-boo I really taught that the animals were hidden an showed back. It is just the leaves opening and closing. But it has great color and my son like it so...I like it, after all, it is for him."
2,Disappointed,"We purchased this mobile after seeing all the rave reviews on Amazon. Unfortunately, I guess we're in the minority. When the mobile arrived the music worked but the motor did not. We had to take it apart and fix it before we could get it to turn. Then, one of the leaves wouldn't work correctly (it stayed stuck in the up position unless you manually tapped on it). I also agree with other reviews about the music being a little too quiet. It's too bad because our daughter did seem to enjoy watching it turn. Anyway, this was a return item for us."
2,Doesn't fit crib,"This mobile is adorable, colorful and engaging. Unfortunately, it did not fit our ""Emily"" crib so had to return. Major bummer, it's the only mobile we really liked."
5,Goes for almost 20 minutes!,"At 10 months old, we still use this toy (sans mobile, now that he can stand). It's been a lifesaver. I'm keeping it for our next baby. The songs are great and they go for a long time. The night light is just enough to be soothing and for mommy to see a bit in the dark, without distracting or waking up the baby if he's falling asleep. I never used the remote, but could see how that could be a plus, too! He turns on his songs now all by himself. It's so cute!"
3,Leaves and Animals Don't Move,"After putting fresh batteries in this mobile the leaves and animals don't spin and move as described. We may have a bad unit as we can ""help"" it along with a tap of our finger but that is weak. Even though it doesn't move it has enough wow or busy-ness for our 4 month old to enjoy looking at it."
4,My son loves it.,"While this fails to put my son to sleep, that doesn't mean he doesn't freaking love it. He likes to watch it move and ""talk"" to it. It's not overly stimulating though. He is very relaxed he just doesn't sleep. He loves for us to change his diaper in the crib so he can watch it go.The mobile came with a slight defect on the ""arm"". This in no way hindered the functionality of the mobile. It appears as though there was a rough part on the metal and the paint didn't go on smoothly because of it. Posted a picture.[...]"
1,Broken after a day of use,"Day 1: Assembled it. Had it up and running, playing music, spinning. The baby just loved it.Day 2: Turned it on and it would not spin. It just made some clicking sounds and played music. Filled out an Amazon request to return due to defect.Day 3: UPS picked it up for return to Amazon.Based on the number of negative reviews if you buy this product your just gambling if you need to return it or not. I would recommend keeping the box for a few days that way if you run into the same problem the return process isn't that difficult. If it breaks outside the return window you are out of luck however so you may want to consider that when making your purchase."
1,DO NOT PURCHASE!!!,"We are sooo disappointed and upset. As a child, I grew up with Fisher Price. In fact, as an artist, I have even incorporated the classical toys in my Motel Series paintings; however, their quality has gone to the toilet. :(We purchased this mobil for our baby as she has had sever acid reflux and we were hoping it would help soothe her. It DID! She LOVED to watch the animals go round and round in the little increments of time that allowed her to be at her 30 degree recline... This all lasted less than a MONTH! :( :(Not only are we angry about the consumer ""rip off"" we are also VERY angry about the WASTE that will go to the landfills. SHAME ON FISHER PRICE for making such a crappy, throw away product."
5,Excellent toy for babies,"I had this mobile on our crib from the day my son was born. He has loved it since then. the colorful animals moving back and forth thru the leaves, the music, the light that comes on, absolutely favorite. I've since given it to my sister-in-law who just had a baby, so that she and her son can enjoy it as well."
1,don't waste your time,"This product was a dissapointment. The motor worked for about 15 minutes, then died. The sounds worked fine, but FisherPrice really dropped the ball and used the cheapest, weakest motor they possibly could. This was a big waste of time and money on all sides of the Amazon equation. I will hesitate before ever buying a FisherPrice item again."
4,Good Product - wish it had higher volume,"Nice product - very cute. However it has only 2 volume sets. The low one is very low (can barely hear) and the high volume set is what I would consider ""Low"" to ""Medium""... other mobiles & soothers I've got have higher volume. My baby just pays attention to it when he's quiet. When he's crying no-one can hear the ""High"" volume set from this mobile, unfortunately."
2,Makes squeaking noises as it rotates,"My 6 week old likes this mobile. I like the rain forest sounds and adjustable volume (although it only has 2 levels), the remote is convenient, the animals are cute (parrot, tree frog, monkey, and dragonfly). It was relatively easy to install (you will need a small screwdriver to open the battery compartments on the mobile and the remote). It does NOT come with batteries (needs 3 D batteries for the mobile and 2 AA for the remote). Unfortunately, it makes squeaking noises as it rotates and sometimes when I switch it on it will not start rotating, I have to push/pull on the leaves to make it start. If it weren't for these faults I would love this product."
3,Nice as a decorative mobile for less price,I purchased recently for our son. The top part of the mobile is great with the moving leaves and hanging animals. The only thing that dissapointed me was the light up area with the music. It really does not light up very bright. Overall if you are looking to not spend a fortune this is a good mobile.
5,Wonderful!,My 2 month old LOVES watching this mobile! She smiles and coos at it whenever it is on. The music choices are great as well. Very happy I purchased it.
1,Motor broke within weeks,"I tend to think negative reviewers come from negative people, but this product really is shoddy. It looks great and operated beautifully for 3 weeks before the motor stopped working (i.e. the leaves stopped rotating and opening/closing; the music and light still work though). I threw out two sets of batteries assuming that was the problem.Choose a different mobile because chances are you won't have time to deal with the warranty or get a replacement mobile once your baby arrives... I wish I had heeded that advice from other reviewers."
2,Motor failed after a while,"My baby enjoyed this mobile. There was a period (when he was 2-3 months old) when he would stop crying and kick excitedly whenever we placed him in his crib and turned the mobile on. But after about 3 months of not-too-heavy use, the motor started making a whirring noise, and would struggle to turn. We replaced the batteries several times (which did not fix the problem), and decided to put up with the whirring noise and the slowness. It finally stopped turning at all after 6 months. I disassembled it, and found that it was cheap plastic construction, which relies on a thin rubber band to rotate the whole assembly. I cleaned the plasticky gunk from the belt-wheel (another plastic piece), but shortly after being reassembled, the mobile slowed down again. It's going in the trash."
5,Wonderful,My 3 month old loves it! He will even talk to it when it is not spinning around. I only wish there were more than one way to attach it as it fits his crib but only fits the side rail and not the back. The push button remote is nice too.
3,great idea. poorly made.,"I was so excited to get this mobile because it had lots of movement and colors for my little one to look at! HOWEVER... after only a few uses (less than a week) the mobile stopped turning. My little one loves this mobile (when it works) so I'm determined to make it work, but I feel that the company should have spent the time to make it work properly."
3,One leaf clunks/sticks loudly,"I think this mobile is very neat looking, and sturdy. It is heavy but secured easily to our crib. Our daughter seems to like it, she is 7 months but can't crawl yet. The volume is just fine even on the lower setting for us. Our daughter isn't around a lot of loud tv or anything anyway. The rain forest sounds are a little quiet but that's okay because they are mostly crickets anyway. I love the music, it is so clear, it sounds great, all of the settings are soothing, not too fast.I have not seen any other reviewers say this, so I am hoping we got a defective one but our mobile has one big leaf that sticks and delays coming down, and when it does it makes a fairly loud clunking noise which sometimes startles our baby. I don't think we could possibly use this mobile to help her sleep... or a future younger baby sleep. We plan on exchanging it and if our new one clunks I am not sure what we will get."
1,Listen to the reviews!,"I read the reviews about this product having defects and not working appropriately after a short time. I thought maybe it was only a select few and would give it a try. When we received it and set it up on the first day I was so impressed. It is gorgeous, soothing, and visually stimulating. My 3 month old son LOVED it! Everything about this mobile was awesome. Music, sounds, movement, etc. And then....it stopped working the next day. We tried new batteries(again) but that wasn't the problem. The lights continue to play and the sound works fine, but the mobile will not spin unless you manually stimulate the leaves. Even then it will make only 1 rotation and stop. Then you have to stimulate it again. It broke my heart to have to send it back, but if I pay for a product I expect it to work properly and I don't have the time or patience to be the mobile's human motor :-("
3,Nice mobile but way too quiet,"Our twins have two different mobiles to keep things interesting. While they enjoy watching this one move, they soon lose interest. I think it's because you can barely hear the music. Another problem is that the remote clicking is so loud that it defeats the purpose. What I do like are the cute and colorful animals and the nice movements. It's pretty good product, but I wouldn't buy it again unless they turn up the volume quite a bit. Overall - attractive, but disappointing."
3,Won't fit a convertible crib,"Seems like a great product, but I was quite upset that it wouldn't attach to our convertible crib. The top ""ledge"" of the crib is too wide."
5,IF YOUR BABY LIKES A FAN...,"My baby loves looking at a fan so I wanted a mobile that would be similar to that--not so much noise--just a little sound but mostly the idea of something moving continuously like a fan would. This is fantastic. Now, it does have sound but it goes low enough for baby to drift off--not like the wind-ups (sooo loud and then you have to crank them) It is very pretty to look at as well. I'm so impressed by it. Great investment. Oh and the remote is priceless. I onlyyyyy wish it would spin for a hint longer--however, it runs on batteries, so I guess the idea is it should go off at some point not to drain them and if you need it on longer you restart it."
5,Babies love it!,"I bought this for our infant twin great-grandsons, and it's a winner with both the babies and the parents. The parents appreciate the music choices, and the babies are entranced with the figures and the movement of the mobile. I'm going to buy this for another newborn in the family. From my own experience with our babies and our grandchildren, I knew that Fisher Price would make a quality item and that this particular mobile would keep the babies' attention."
3,Bulky,"I found it hard to get this mobile on the crib. I am worried it will fall on the baby! It's a heavy base. I actually used floss to help secure it. I like the mobile, though. It's intricate so I'm not sure how durable it is. My 2 month-old likes it."
3,Nice but stopped working properly,"Overall, this is a very nice mobile; however, it stopped working properly after just a couple months. Because of that fact, I would not recommend it.Pluses- My son quite likes it -- not as much as the Haba Flutterbys mobile, but well enough. He was about two months when we got it and is five months now.- The animals are bright and engaging.- The rainforest sound is very pleasant.Minuses- Stopped working properly after maybe two months. It gets stuck and makes a grinding sound until I give it a push (defeating the purpose of having the mobile - to entertain my son for a few minutes so I can do something else). It is not the batteries.- The classical music setting are pretty tinny - but my son still seems to like them OK."
5,Adorable,"I like the product, it arrived on time as in the condition described. Very pleased with the service.Thank you."
3,Cute Mobile-remote is pretty useless-needs a better light show,"Our 5 month old baby loves the bright colors and soft music of this mobile. It is engaging and fun but the lights are pretty dim and it doesn't have a light show like some others. Also, we have not been able to get our remote for the mobile to work unless we stand a foot away and point it directly at the mobile. Remote needs to be more sensitive. We do wish we had purchased a mobile sooner as it buys us 10-15 minutes to take a shower while she plays in her crib!"
4,Excellent Mobile,"We purchased this mobile to match other Fisher Price Rainforest line items. Great mobile - adorable, good selection of music. We appreciate the handheld remote to turn it off / on. Easy to attach to crib side."
1,Didn't work,"I was very excited to get this mobile and we were so disappointed when it didn't turn. The music played as advertised but I think the leaves were too heavy for the little battery powered motor. It rotated only until the part where the leaves were supposed to lift up and then it stopped. I would give this 5 stars for color and cuteness, but only 2 for music quality and 0 for the fact that it doesn't work at all.Too bad."
1,Disappointed !!!!,"Mobile stopped turning after 10 minutes! The music stilled played but the mechanism that turns the mobile would not turn. Not sure who was more disappointed baby or parents! Had to run out and purchase another mobile. Now trying to figure out how to returnPs. This product was discontinued by Fisher-Price, I guess I know why!"
5,Love our rainforest friends,We spent an hour comparing different mobiles before we settled on this one. We were not disappointed. It is one of our most used baby items. At 2 weeks our daughter loved watching the motions. At five months she still loves watching her rainforest friends. I don't know how many times I have hit the rainforest sounds button in the middle of the night and she will happily watch until she falls asleep. It is worth every penny. I was initially excited about the 4 different classical but I really prefer the rainforest sounds. On really hard to fall asleep evenings we also turn on her Sleep Sheep to make a little extra white noise. I've only had to change the batteries twice - so not too bad.
4,a wise purchase,My baby definitely likes it! He would watch it and laugh by himself for 20 minutes or even one hour.While he pays no attention to other music box
4,My son loves it but its soo quiet,"The mobile holds my 2 month old son's attention. The basic colors make it easy for him to see, as he prefers to look the lights for the contrast. The mobile has 2 volumes, both of which fairly quiet (especially the rainforest sounds). The length of time it plays is sufficient, not too long or too short. I would recommend this mobile for young babies, since it seems to have helped develop my son's focus and eye contact."
3,Cake topper,"I'm very pleased with this purchase, which was used as a cake topper for a theme birthday party"
5,Excellent,"This took me three days to read and I had a heck of a time putting it down. At times it was steamy. It was full of suspense. And the unfolding of events was perfect. I found only one typo, but it did not detract from the story. It was that good"
5,Neo Pagan Horror,"I now have all of Dion Fortune's fiction. When I read The Sea Priestess last year I really liked it a lot, rating it my second favorite novel I've ever read behind Crowley's Moon Child. That is because it made such an impact on me that whatever makes you happy the endorphins go off, and it satisfied my fantasies of Atlantis, the occult and as an alternative to Harry Potter or Stephen King. This is the most neo pagan out of all of Fortune's fiction, with the title The Goat Foot God it is a referance to Pan, an old god of centuries past."
1,Dry as cardboard,"The dragons won't eat this product but on a very rare occation. The product advertises that it is ""moist""... WRONG, and not true. I will not be buying this product again."
1,This guy learned NOTHING,"This was a terrible book. The author learned nothing from his divorce. He never accepts personal responsiblity for his actions that led to the divorce. I bought this book because I am curious about other people's stories since my divorce. I can tell you that this book was not helpful, not insightful and was poorly edited with many typos to boot."
4,Fantastic Fournier,"On this 4CD EMI Import, the great cellist Pierre Fournier performs a variety of orchestral and chamber recordings, recorded primarily in mono from the 1940s and early 50s. There are three orchestral works -- Haydn's 2nd Concerto (Kubelik/Philharmonia, 1951), Schumann's Concerto (Sargent/Philharmonia, 1956 in stereo), and Tchaikovsky's Rococo Variations (Bigot/Lamoureux, 1941). Disc two, and half of disc three, contain Beethoven Cello Sonatas with the great Artur Schnabel, while the fourth disc features a variety of pieces, from Bach and Boccherini to Debussy and Ravel, with pianist Gerald Moore. I'm withholding a fifth star because the collection contains mostly historical recordings, though it certainly captures one of history's greatest cellists in his prime. With that being said, ""Les Introuvables de Pierre Fournier"" is a must buy for cello entusiasts."
4,Good.,"Subtitles different on ""Jenin Jenin"" in first sector of this double feature DvD than in the original 'Jenin Jenin' release. Also ""Since You Left"" is good follow up about the director of 'Jenin Jenin' and all the turmoil about the movie's release in Israel- Although I would much rather have seen footage of the Jenin Camp & how everybody was doing from 3 years after in this double feature 'Since You Left'. That's the downside- there is no footage of Jenin Camp in 'Since You Left' nor any interviews with previous people from 'Jenin Jenin'."
1,Polarwrap crap!,"Don't buy this product or you'll be sorry.If you don't have a nose, and you don't breath, then this product is perfect for you. Great for cyborgs, robots, terminators, etc.See my review of the Talus ColdAvenger Mask. It's great!"
3,Okay...Not Great,"I bought this book based on the glowing reviews I read here at Amazon. I'm afraid I have to disagree with the 4 and 5 star reviews.""Shadows at Sunset"" is the first Anne Stuart book I've read. While this book was entertaining, had some interesting characters, and a bit of suspense - it was a little too ""light"" to be considered a 5 star read.The whole story takes place over the matter of a week and I'm supposed to believe that Jilly and Coltrane fell in love? Aside from a night of great sex, they barely knew each other! I also found the ""ghost"" angle to be pretty cheesy.This book could have been better had the author taken more time (and pages) to developing her characters and the story more thoroughly. There's the basis for a really good book here, but the light, ""speed through the writing"" approach doesn't work for me."
4,Could not put it down!,"Ever since this book came out I've been dancing back and forth. I would put it on my list to buy and then when I would read the back cover I would take it off the list. I would read the reviews from Amazon and put it on the list and then take it off again. Finally, I just bought it and found I could not put it down once I started reading. It was very good - compelling. I kept reading just to find out more about Coltrane and what he was up to and how he was going to achieve his end. This was the first Anne Stuart book I have read and as soon as I get done writing this, I am going to work at finding her other books. I would highly recommend this book. If you are put off by the mention of ghosts, don't be. They really didn't play that important of a part - they were far in the background of the story. If you are looking for a book with a sexy/dangerious hero and a story to completely absorb you don't miss Shadows at Sunset."
5,Shadows at Sunset,"This is the first book I have read by Anne Stuart and was pleasantly surprised. Several of my favorite authors, I have already gone through all their books. Now, I have the rest of Anne Stuart's to enjoy. Great read, great author."
5,Suspenseful and romantic,"Contains usual Stuart elements: wacko family, tough heroine with strong protective streak, gorgeous but conniving hero and it all comes together in a different and gripping read that is fast paced and totally satisfying."
5,Revenge is not always sweet,"His name is Coltrane and he is a man filled with hate and contempt for the man who killed his mother. He plots and plans to destroy the man through his children. Nothing is too vile for him to do; even seducing the man's daughters, Jilly and Rachel-Ann. It would be so easy for him except that Jilly is more than he bargained for. As this story of lies and mystery unravel in an old Hollywood mansion, who will survive when the truth comes out and who will be destroyed. A book you can't put down until the very last page."
4,Latest From Stuart,"Pretty good effort from Stuart. I was most captivated by the secondary characters Rachel-Ann and Rico and wish the book had been about them. They were a lot more interesting and compelling to me than the main couple, Jilly and Coltrane. I especially wanted to know more about how Rico came to be in the situation he was in and what his life to that point had been like.The ghosts were okay, but nothing to write home about. Overall the book had more of a category feel to--it just seemed to lack depth. As a reader I felt like I was in and out of the book so fast that I was never immersed in the story, as I was in her previous release, Shadow Lover."
5,A big Fan,"I really enjoyed this book from the begining all the way to the end. The characters were real, the writing was griping and I can hardly wait for the next book in this series."
3,"Hollowed out handles - lightweight, inexpensive feel","From the pictures you would assume this flatware has thick, heavy, solid stainless steel handles. In fact, only the knife does; on the rest of the pieces the handles are very flat, thin & hollowed out, giving them a lightweight and unbalanced feel in the hand. Still an attractive pattern & good deal with the bonus offer, I just would have preferred to see a side view of the pieces before buying & being disappointed. I gave this set away & went back to using my old flatware simply because it has a more substantial feel - ""American Harmony"" left me totally unimpressed."
1,Waste of money,I have tried two of these items. The first refused to retract and Amazon quickly replaced it as defective. The second one fell apart in my hands as I very cautiously tried to retract the cord. This item is an absolute piece of junk! I will not even return it again as I want nothing more to do with it...I will eat the $7 and chalk it up to educational costs.RETRAK / EMERGE ETMOUSER Retractable Optical Mini Travel Mouse
4,Refreshing and challenging,"I read this for an MA course. Since Handy lives in Great Britain, he has a wonderfully refreshing view of leadership and political life (and how they work together). I'm so glad I read this book. It's conclusions are challenging but make sense."
3,"Slightly interesting, but boring over all.","This books starts off with a very confusing cast of characters. Each character is not described in depth enough, so it makes you alittle confused about who he is, or what he is. Each chapter is filled with about 7 to 8 story lines which once again confuses you. Then the setting is not decribed to detail so you have to let your imagination do the work of the author. The book does a poor job of involving the reader and makes you slightly bored in between chapters. The ending of the book makes you feel that you have just read 301 pages for no reason. I total suggest you read this if you have a lack of imagination, because maybe it will help you bostt is alittle."
3,It was okay.,"For this type of dvd (translation as opposed to immersion), I think they did a good job. It was nice to hear native Spanish speakers which I think is very important for children to be exposed to when learning a new language.I liked the Rapid Review option at the end. It's a good way to go over the vocabulary without going through the entire dvd. Also, the grammar explanations will be quite helpful to monolingual parents who want to introduce Spanish to their children. That was impressive to me.On the other hand, I still think there was too much English in my opinion. Also, I think it would've have been nice if Paco the rooster had been more lively. He talked in a monotone voice.My 5 year old son said he enjoyed it, but hasn't asked to see it again. My eight year old was less than enthusiastic about it."
2,"No data, all anecdotes","I am having trouble getting through this book because it is fairly boring. It goes on and on about tedious subjects, for instance there as an entire chapter on the ""back office"" culture of wall st. firms in the 60's. I didn't buy this book to read about the lifestyles of accountants and typists. A lot of the info is simply stories and anecdotes and it is very light on data, but I guess that is what you get when you buy a book from a journalist from the New Yorker instead of an academic who has deep data and knowledge. This book is really more about the culture of wall st. in the 60's, and less about the actual statistics, data, and history, and the analysis is quite superficial."
1,Not as good as hoped for,Written poorly and takes a potentially interesting topic and turns it into banalities. Skip it
3,Average release from an above-average performer,"As much as I admire and love Teena Marie, I can't give this one any more than three stars. While there are some good tracks (""Crocodile Tears"", ""Call Me"", and the hit ""Ooo La La La""), the majority of the songs just don't ""Work It"".Mediocrity doesn't become Teena."
5,Real Stories from Real People,"This is the third ""Minnesota Memories"" from Joan Graham. I've read them all! This one is as delightful as its predecessors.Graham suggests that you get together with friends and read the stories aloud--they are sure to trigger associations and soon people will be telling their own stories. Joan Graham believes that everyone has stories just waiting to be told or written. This book attests to her belief--it is a wonderful collection of real stories from real people."
5,Mandatory Reading for All Who Love Minnesotans,"I married a St. Olaf graduate who still carries her Minnesota accent after 40 years. Until I read this volume and the other two books in the series, I never really understood those North Star inhabitants who are afraid to say anything for fear of ""making waves,"" who adore Eddie Cochran's hit ""Sittin' in the Balcony,"" who worship Owatonna's Sullivan designed bank as a shrine, and who worry about everything from weather to the success of this year's corn crop. These books should be required reading for those who know and love Minnesotans or just want to understand the people who make the state so special. The final entry, Governor Pawlenty's Inaugural Address, made me especially appreciate Minnesotans' contributions to our daily lives."
5,Worked great!,"Cable was everything that was promised, and at a price that could not be beat. Now if we could just figure out a way to get the price of shipping down, heh?"
3,Book Better than the Guide,I ordered this to use in our small group but ended up writing my own discussion question and using one or two of the guide questions from each lesson. I found that more specific questions led to better discussion and more participation.
5,Great Book,This book was reccomended to me as a pre-marital counseling tool and it was great. I have since reccomended it to a few other people. This is a great book if you really want to understand the man in your life.
1,"Arrived broken, too fragile for shipping","This you broke in two places before it was outOf the package,. We were very disappointed in the quality and forand durability for the price. We may be sending itback."
2,Did not like assumption abby fruit cake,It didn't arrive on time. Unremarkable taste texture and was sorta dry. certainly did not live up to all the hype. I paid for 1 day shipping and it arrived AFTER our christmas party. I will definately not order this particular fruit cake again.
2,very flat in favor,"it was very bland, would not buy again. was not worth the price.What else is there to say ?"
5,Love Assumption Abbey Fruitcake,"This is the best fruitcake I have ever had and on the top of my family's list of best desserts. It is dark, rich, all natural, and wonderfully balanced. Most bad fruitcakes use too many artificial ingredients to keep costs down, but makes the fruitcake taste awful. I wish more people would try this fruitcake, it would change a lot of negative opinions about fruitcake."
5,Just like what you find in England!,"We got this for my husband, who is English, as Fruitcake is traditional during Christmas in the UK. We did our research before ordering as we wanted to make sure we got the best one out there, especially since he is used to his mom's homemade fruitcake. We were not disappointed! My husband said it tasted ""authentic"" and that it was just like the ones back home. It was moist, dense and flavorful. Highly recommend!"
2,Assumption Abbey Fruit Cake,The fruit cake was just OK; mostly dry cake and very little fruit. May I ask what year the cake was baked?Assumption Abbey Fruit Cake
4,Fruitcake lovers take note,"I purchased this fruitcake for my husband, who loves fruitcake. He said it was delicious! However, he did take note that it was not as good as my mother's. I tried it and he was right. I think because she wrapped it in rum or whiskey soaked cloths for 6 months before she served it made the difference. He did rate it as better than the $10.00 grocery store fruitcakes. If my mother's recipe didn't make about 20 pounds of fruitcake and take two people to mix, I would make it again. Meantime, because of the economy, we'll stick to the grocery store."
3,tasty cake,"This fruitcake was very rich and tasty. The rating is only 3 stars, however, because of 2 negatives. The first was that the tin it comes in had a too large lid so that the fruitcake was not sealed once it was opened and the tin was pretty much useless therefore to store anything in once the cake was consumed. While I liked the taste, I was also disappointed that the ingredient list included many additives that were not listed when I ordered it. In fact I chose this one over another because I was trying to buy one with less artificial ingredients."
5,Amazing flatware!,"I grew up with Oneida Colonial Boston, and when it came time to select a flatware pattern, I heartily endorsed registering for a set of this. The weight is perfect and the look is clean and timeless. The design has slightly changed since my childhood, but it is no less sturdy or well-made than it was 25-30 years ago, and I in fact think that the materials are better. The metal is shinier than I remember, and it feels a little less bulky. I highly recommend!"
5,Just Right,"A simple, elegant design, heavy well balanced pieces, excellent finish - these all add up to a product that is just what we were looking for."
5,Great everyday flatware,"Not too heavy but substantial enough, the soup spoons are not too big, little children cope with them, simple and durable. Just great. I keep the Christofle in the cupboard and even use them when I have guests."
5,Spiritually Uplifting!,"I really enjoyed this Novel. It is so spiritually uplifting, that you can feel the Holy Spirit all around you. It makes you want to read on and on and on. I would recomend this novel to anyone who loves the Lord, or who is searching for the truth about the Bible, and God"
5,Fast and in good condition!,"Arrived fast and in great shape. I'd read the book before, so i'm enjoying reading it again. Thanks, ~MJ!"
2,This is a toy.,"I bought this guitar to have something small to noodle around with on the couch, or to take on camping trips and play around the campfire.I know it is only $90, but I was expecting a little more than this. It has a plastic fretboard, with tiny frets. The action is very high even on it's lowest setting. I am currently in the process of adjusting the truss rod. If that doesn't work I am going to try a few other things to lower the action.They claim this is a ""student"" guitar, but I would not buy it for someone just learning to play. The high action would make it very frustrating for a beginner. Ditch the strings it comes with immediately.I gave it two stars because it is cheap."
2,Should have went with a better guitar,"I am a beginner when it comes to playing the guitar. Right when I got it, my brother helped me tune it. It took a while, but sounded pretty good once it was tuned. After about a week or less, I had to tune it again. It is the type of cheap guitar that I have to keep tuning just about every other day. But that is what I get when I pay less than $100.00 for a guitar."
2,You get what you pay for,"The main reason I wanted to get this tea set was for the box and not necessarily for the tea. I have been looking for a nice tea box for my wife to match our cherry cabinets. Surprisingly, it is a lot harder finding a nice quality box with a window.Again to reiterate, I have not tried the tea so I will not comment on that. The box however is very poorly built. The picture is a lot nicer than what we received. There is no way I could give this to my wife as a gift. The inside compartments were bent and it looks like someone from elementary school pasted the inside lining because the felt was crooked and did not even cover the entire inside of the box. The stain outside was uneven, especially at the lip where you are suppose to open the box.I had originally bought this because I saw a 5 star rating for this product. Even though ratings are subjective, this product is far from a 5 star rating."
1,Didn't work well,It might just be the type of cat litter we use but these didn't work well for us. I gave the second package away for them to try with their hard clumping clay litter. It's just easier to use the scoop because I won't change back to clay litter; it's too dusty.
3,Pretty Funny,"Toshiaki Toyoda creates a decent socially awkward movie with one of the coolest stab scense I've ever seen. Some of the dialogue is lame and the pace can be slow. This movie feels like Taxi Driver's mute little brother and has a pretty funky ending. Overall, it had cheesy goodness like Toyoda's other films and I don't regret buying it."
5,Yummy and fast shipping,I bought this for a bridal shower and it came in two days! The jelly beans are just like what you would get in a store and there are about 400 of them. Definitely buy if you want cream soda jelly beans.
2,Overpriced,"$7.99 for a sticker plus $5.99 for shipping in a simple envelope!!! Way, way overpriced.!!! If it was not for my daughter, I would have sent it back and asked for double the price in return. Do not waste your money on this cheap junk!!!"
3,Oregon Scientific MP120/BL256C 256 MB Waterproof MP3 Player with FM Tuner Black,The earbuds do not work very well...that is if they work at all.
5,Get your Freak on!,"Seeing a well written, fresh, updated spin on the Mythos is extremely cool! What is even better is the undeniable similarities to Brian Lumley's Necroscope books. In fact, Spike Team Texas, Storch and Stella's abilities to morph and desire to eat people sound more like Lumley's Wamphyri than they do shaggoth to me. Not to mention that antagonist, Keogh, is bound to be a nod to Harry Keogh (much like Storch - Harry also fought the urge to eat flesh) from the Necroscope books. Anyway, those and other similarities are a good thing to me because Lumley hasn't been writing much lately (Wamphyri or Lovecraft stuff). It is clear that Goodfellow is able to bring together many of the works that I have grown to love over the years. I also have his short fiction, Silent Weapons for Quiet Wars, and look forward to reading that next!"
4,Interpreting the Cultural Relic of Spaceflight,"The author ruminates on the scarred spaceflight culture that Apollo created and the later space program destroyed. She visits Roswell, New Mexico, with its alien kitsch, and the Kennedy Space Center and Cocoa Beach, Florida, with its gigantic rocket assembly buildings and launch complexes and reminders of the heyday of Apollo, when humans went to the Moon. Now, more than half of the world's population has been born since the last Apollo mission to the Moon in December 1972, and those exciting events seem much less real than previously. She also explores the frontiers of cyperspace, suggesting that this may become the final frontier instead of the Moon and Mars and other places in the universe."
2,Oregon Scientific BWR102 Bath Scale w/ Wireless Display,"The scale works ok for me but I bought it for my mom who has a history of congestive heart failure and we like to keep an eye on her weight to make sure she isn't getting fluid overloaded. She has also had a stroke, she uses a cane or walker and steps carefully when she walks.When I step on the scale it gives me a reading, but when my mom steps on it it gives an error message (because she can't step on it quickly enough it seems).There is a lag time from when you step on the scale and your weight appears on the scale to the time it appears on the wireless display. This isn't a big deal just a note."
4,Great Read!,"Great read, recommend it to all my friends. Can never have enough good books. Worthwhile buy and you will enjoy it."
5,Listen for your own whispers. . .,"A Whisper in Winter helped me to realize that God speaks to us in all circumstances, we just have to stop and listen. Shannon's book is truly an inspiration. I laughed at Zac's antics, cried at the babies that were lost and smiled when this truly Christian woman learned a new lesson. This is a must have book that should be kept on your bedside table where you can pick it up at anytime and be remined that God is speaking to you every day."
2,"looks good, feels cheap","This flatware set looks nice- true to pictues online, but the pieces are too lightweight and too small. The dessert spoon is especially small and the knife is disproportionately heavy. Just not worth about [price]/ set!"
5,Doesn't get crud stuck in them or fall through rack in dishwasher,"I searched and searched for a simple, sleek place setting because so many readily available in stores have tacky ornate designs that allow food crud to get stuck in their crevices. And many other setting types are two fused pieces where gunk can collect or form a weak point where they can/do break. Most importantly, I can put them in the dishwasher rack right side up or down without their falling through. They go with any dish design, too. Easy for kids to use. Very sturdy, but stylish in an oh so modern way."
5,Everyday flatware since 2000,"I bought the full set for 8 with the serving utensils April 8, 2000 from Hecht's. In the years since, my dinnerforks have ""gotten away"". I love this flatware set. I loved this pattern out of all patterns. I am looking forreplacements dinner forks. I had no idea this is still on the market. It is still my favorite flatware and hope toreplace the missing forks. The pieces aren't too heavy, and the pattern is simple & elegant. I love it!"
1,20 lb single Cylander Tank Cover,"Tank covers looks nice, but did not fit the Cylinder. I ordered two and they are to small to fit over my 20 LB tanks. Velcro would not streach to fit tanks and the hole on top is way to small. Company took them back, but it cost close to $15.00 to ship them back and total cost of the product was just over $22.00. I would not order from here again just because of the high return shipping.I only got $7.00 of my $22.00 back after shipping items back. I was not happy with this purchase. It cost me $15.00 to find out the product was useless to me."
5,"Great absorption, expensive shipping","I have tried this and the ""Just the Crystals"" litter. This one (Pestell) seems to have a higher absorption, however with the shipping it ends up being more expensive. Just another note: Pestell's crystals are too big for the Forever Litter Tray."
3,Crystals are great but please DO NOT FLUSH,"There is only one ""name brand"" crystal product currently available and it is in almost every way inferior to the several brands sold here, doesn't really absorb well, and it is just as expensive, including the shipping, even when bought at Malwart. There is somewhat of a problem with the size of some crystals being too big for the scoopers.I prefer brands that don't come in these ridiculous industrial-weight plastic tubs. You can get Fresh Magic at Amazon in a cardboard box with just a heavy plastic bag holding the crystals.PLEASE DO NOT FLUSH this stuff (or any other cat litter, for that matter). It cause all kinds of problems with municipal waste water systems - if it gets that far and doesn't mess up your own drains."
3,Works well for odor and tracking issues but quite dusty,"The cat took no time to get used to this. She's generally notpicky though. I also have no issues with this product with respect to how it works to control odor and tracking, but the fine cloud of dust that drifts up makes me think it can't be good for my cat. I am wary of her inhaling this as she's scratching around in there. The dust definitely lingers; I think it clings to my clothes because I can smell it on me after. I think I'm going to switch back to the litter I was using before after this batch is done."
4,Loose Litter,"The product works great. I did not get the ammonia smell that I have received with some of the cheaper crystal litters. Unfortunately, we ordered two pails and both had opened up in the shipping box. So we did loose some of the litter. I hope next time they tape down the lids!"
4,A beautiful adaptation of the theme of Fate,"Ana is a fated woman- plagued by visions and dreams damning her and deriding her. And, as her story progresses, we see that her life must follow the path of despair in order to reach redemption. The story draws on elements of the Holy Bible (the stations of the cross), Hardy's Tess of the D'Urbervilles, and Oedipus Rex to play out a story of modern hardships, ancient beliefs, and destabilization of the status quo. This is a beautifully told story that undulates between first and third person, giving the reader the advantage of the first-person narrative and the objective third."
4,Good,Book came in the condition advertised. I had read this book a long time ago and wished to reread it. The story itself is pretty thought provoking.
4,Disappointing price for a good product,Home Depot and Lowes sells this for $8/pair. I went onto Amazon to buy bulk...they sell this 6 for $52. You would expect them to be below $8x6=$48 and beat them. Big disappointment with Amazon!!
1,Cheaper to buy Two,Why is it cheaper to buy a 2-pack ($8.15 each) than buying 6 2-packs ($8.48 each) ?
3,does not seem cheaper to me either?,"I just bought the same ones at Home Depot here in NY for $8.25 for the 2 pack. So at the price on here, I am better off at the Depot. Thanks."
4,Shepp's still aflame!,"This 1994 Geneva performance is a must have. Shepp still has his chops here and that energy is still fierce. Very well filmed and interesting to watch him continue to work with polyphonic approaches to the horn. Assisted by Horace parlan, Wayne Dockery, and Steve McCraven the performance is tight. Most of which Shepp and his friends play are blues. Seems he's returning to his roots here. Call it a reclaimation if you will, but you won't find the avant-garde pulse he was working with in the 60's. That's all right as he continues to play here with both deep heart and passion."
2,greasy,This product is very inexpensive and should work but it is similar to vaseline and smells worse. Okay to apply at night if you sleep alone.
3,Icebound,"I thought the book was really interesting about people risking their lives doing dangerous job. These characters in Icbound were very educated people, they all had special talent and they love their jobs even though it was dangerous."
3,Icebound,"I thought it was very suspenseful but far fetched. It didnt sound believable in any way to me. But, I thought it was good reading for a rainy day."
4,another koontz classic,"i inhale this guy's books, and this one is no different. he does such an amazing job of setting the arctic scene that i was cold just reading it. my own complaint was that a good whodunit should give you clues as to who the villain is, whereas this time, there was only one. otherwise, i'd recommend it!"
2,Not very good for a Koontz,"I was dissapointed in Icebound. This may have been a fair book for many writers, but I expect more from Dean Koontz. This was a mild and boring attempt. Not what readers have come to expect from Dean Koontz."
3,"An entertaining read, but nothing to write home about","First let me say that this is my first experience with the work of Dean Koontz, and the only other one I've read since was ""Intensity"" (which was far better, in my opinion). I listened to this audiobook during a solo car trip from Washington D.C. to Virginia Beach about four years ago. The plot was certainly interesting, and the suspense was real, but I couldn't help feeling that the characters were to cliched and one-dimensional, and Koontz' use of metaphors was overbearing. Oh, and FYI, Dean Koontz: the last time I heard a black person say ""honky"" was George Jefferson, circa 1979. Anyway...it was an entertaining story, bogged down by some slightly frustrating flaws. Read ""Intensity"" instead. Lives up to the title."
2,It was a tragedy that kept getting worse and worse.,I didn't like Icebound because it was a tragedy that was so exagerated it seemed that every thing that could go wrong did. The story just got worse and worse for the characters and the natural disasters that made the plot would be almost imposible in real life.
3,Arctic thriller,"This is the first by Koontz I've read, and I do agree that he has a great style, especially with pacing and suspence. This story of Arctic researchers stranded on an iceberg with a timebomb, as well as a psychotic killer, is quite fun, but I felt it was almost stereotypical. I didn't figure out who the killer was, but I fairly knew it would all end well. Granted, this book was originally published in 1976 (under the title ""Prison of Ice""), so it's a bit dated, but still. It's an exciting read, and for mind-candy it's quite great. Even though I was unimpressed by this book, I will definitely read others by Koontz because his style is quite compelling, and that was what I was captivated by while reading."
4,Okay . . . but not great,"First of all I'd like to quote from a previous reviewer:""(1 star) = Unbelievable!, April 7, 2000Reviewer: A readerIn reading the reviews of this so-called, awful novel, I don't see where these people get off stating that it was a good book. I could'nt even get past the 2nd chapter, cause I did not understand the message Koontz was getting at. Very, very confusing""There is absolutly nothing confusing about this book, that review must have been 9 years old. And reviewing it after not getting to the 2nd chapter is pathetic.Now, my side of the story. This book is very well written, however . . . the plot is rather predictiable, zero horror, and at times you will want to stop at every perspective change, tiime change, and/or chapter. I really don't suggest reading this apposed to other Koontz books, but for any hardcore Koontz fan this is a must read (if not just for the cover alone :)"
1,Ice-cap thriller,"The book seems to be written according to the mystery/thriller recipe. I knew in advance what would happen next, precisely because, having read a few thrillers, I happen to know the recipe according to which this book was written. Snip: (...)"
2,not one of my favorites,"I Have had a copy of Icebound since '95 and I just can not get into it no matter how many times I have picked it up. While waiting for new releases, I go to my book shelf and read again the novels that I have. I would not recommend that this be the first Koontz book you read. I suggest The Bad Place. That was the first one I read and was instantly hooked. I am in the process of reading False Memory now and that is great too. I can't wait untill From the Corner of His Eye comes out on paperback. Anyway, I don't think this novel stands out as one of his best. OH and THe Face of Fear was really good as well. Same with Strangers."
3,Not One of His Best,"The book is about a team of scientists trapped on a floating Iceberg and their attempt to get off before it explodes. I found the book for the most part to be boring, with most of the action surrounding the rescue attempts. For the most parts the final rescue attempt is kind of elaborate. There were times in the book where I thought why don't they just do this, instead of that to get off the iceberg. But anyway since this is a reissue of one of his earlier books, I won't be as critical. Thank goodness his later books are much better."
2,Boring,I am a huge fan of Dean Koontz and have loved every book I've read by him (about 15) EXCEPT Icebound. The story is boring and the characters are bland. I found myself never really caring if they ever got off the stupid iceberg and even hoping it would blow them all up. The action doesn't start for about 3/4 of the way into the book. My advice is pass this one up for a more exciting book.
3,Disappointed,"This book, written in the style of Alister MacLean, is unlike anything else Dean Koontz has published. While it is well written, I find myself missing what I read Dean Koontz books for - suspense, deep characterizations, and the compelling need to keep turning the pages all night long. Wish I'd paid more attention to the descriptions before I bought this one."
4,"A Pretty Good ""Chiller""","Though not as frightening as other stories by Mr. Koontz, Icebound is suspenseful. It's a good listen especially if you need to while away several hours on a trip."
1,Awful,"Icebound is a re-write from an earlier published 'Koontz-pseudonym' novel published in the 70's. This premise is farfetched, the re-write is extremely poor and it seems to me that this book is just a re-released money making opportunity. Come on Dean, you can do better than that!"
1,Not at all what I expected,No supernatural or unusual events. It was just a retelling of Ice Station Zebra by Alistair MacLean. Boring really. I kept waiting for something interesting to happen.
5,I am always amazed by Dean Koontz,"Icebound was definitly a walk off the beaten path for Dean Koontz but he carried it off in style. I loved the charactors and the tension. I got the book Christmas eve and finished it Christmas night. A definite ""have to"" for Koontz fans everywhere."
2,Not worth the retail price,"Dean Koontz does a wonderful job with the physical aspects in this book.However this is the only thing 'wonderful'about this novel.Koontz is too occupied with politics,and one wonders if communist and politicians have had some past distasteful history with him. All but two of his characters are well developed .There is too little history about Roger, and thus Koontz gives no enlightenment of his psychotic motive/s.The other dissapointing character was Pete,one would expect that after Harry disclosed the true nature of Brian's accident to him(together with Koontz's physical description of him),that he would play some major role in the climax"
2,Only for the most loyal of Koontz fans,"Wow! I read Watchers, Strangers, Dark Rivers, and fell in love with Koontz' supernatural thrillers. Then Icebound: just an ordinary adventure, with a very ordinary bad guy lurking around... no supernatural stuff; no mind control, no boogeyman, no poltergeist, etc. By Koontz' own admission, he wanted to try writing a story like Tom Clancy or Clive Cussler... he did an OK job. That's the problem: I don't like spending precious time and dollars on an ordinary adventure. I will be very careful which of his I buy next"
4,Enjoyable Audiobook,"I'm surprised it took me so long to get around to trying Koontz. I've been a Stephen King fan for years but I was never really tempted to try Koontz. I'm so happy that I finally got around to picking up a few of his books because I can't get enough of him now.I've really been enjoying listening to his books on CD and MP3. I use them as my ""bedtime stories"". It's a great way to squeeze in extra books and they're great entertainment.I'm picking up every single one that I can find so I'm getting my Koontz education fairly quickly. Icebound was really well done with good narration. I never thought I'd enjoy listening to books on tape as much as I do. If you haven't tried them, I'd encourage you to pick up a few. A good narrator makes all the difference!"
3,not the best but allright,"ok ive read about 7 of koontz's books and this one was my least favorite. it never really grabbed my attention like his others. this book is just all about describeing how cold it is and this guys wife not likeing cold weather. but anyways i guess this book wasent bad and if you like koontz books you should go and read this one anyway. but if you really want a good koontz book go read something like intensity, tick tock, dragon tears, or watchers. now those are good books"
5,A blessing for those facing death.,"I found this book very convincing in a way no other book has been for me. It comforted all the members of my family immensely after the death of my 11 year old grandson, Jonnie, of leukemia. We also used it before Jonnie died to prepare him for his own possible death. Jonnie was not afraid to die and this book is part of the reason. I am grateful to Dr. Morse for giving us this wonderful tool.Jonnie is still our hero. He started two charities to benefit kids with cancer, the first at age 8, the second at age 10. He won the Kids With Courage Award 2002 and the 2002 Local Hero Award. http://www.jonniescharity.com"
5,"Fascinating, Comforting, Believable","I read this book right after my father died, and found it immensely comforting. The Near Death Experience (or NDE) has been recorded in many peoples, cultures and times, and is a human phenomenon that cannot be denied. It exists. But what does it mean?Dr. Morse's research of the NDE in children was especially interesting, as children are guileless and have no axes to grind. Indeed, many of the children experienced places and beings in their NDE that did not coincide with the religious beliefs they had been taught.Unfortunately, the subject makes some in the scientific community uncomfortable, and so we may not see additional or followup studies anytime soon.This book was fascinating in a scientific way, and I couldn't help but feel that I was getting a bonafide peek at the world that follows this one. I highly recommend it, especially to anyone who has experienced a recent bereavement."
1,5 Stars for Child Torture,"[...]Oh yeah, sounds like a real trustworthy individual. Is anyone really surprised, that another religious twit has done something absolutely horrendous? Whether the religion eroded away his normal human feelings, or just helped fester an already rotting brain, we will never know.This book is a piece of trash written by a crazy sick demented religious nut-bag child abusing monster.The book's only worth is that of a case study in psychopathy."
1,When you research by repeatedly waterboarding your 11 year old daughter...,"Yeah, this is just sick. A monster like this should not be able to profit from torture, especially the torture of a CHILD, just so they can sell a crappy book."
3,interesting stories but illogical conclusion,"This was an interesting book, but I do not agree with the author's conclusions. He says that scientists have found the place in the brain where near death experiences originate (he was instrumental in discovering it) yet he still says that near death experiences are legitimate proof of the afterlife. How can that be if they can be reproduced in a lab, as he says? He has the facts but came to an illogical conclusion. I am an atheist, but I read this book because I consider it important to have an open mind, and it did not change my beliefs"
4,Very interesting book.,"This book was very interesting and I would highly recommend it. I think I read it in two sittings. I mostly liked the specific discussion of the actual case studies, but was less impressed with the author's interpretations. That is the problem in this area of so-called ""near death experiences"" is that there isn't always a clear line of demarcation between description of experience and interpretation of experience. Anyway, a very worthy read."
2,A meandering and dilute little book,"Oddly enough, I bought this book to learn the specifics of NDE reported to the author in his study of children. What I got was a book that was mostly the author's opinions and experiences working within the medical field. Not that the author doesn't have some good ideas---he does---but that's not why I, and I suspect many others, bought the book. We bought it to hear the specific details of the ""hundreds"" of children he interviewed for his study. And that we did not get. If you are interested in a decent man's thoughtful opinions on how the medical field should deal with death, then by all means buy this book. If you want to hear NDE experiences be prepared to wade through a book mostly not about this subject."
2,Not What I Expected,"If you are expecting several accounts from children about what they saw while having a near death experience, this book is not for you. While it does offer a few accounts (very few), most of them are very brief and scattered among pages and pages of how the studies came to be, supposition of what does or does not cause NDEs, and theories about them. How it became a best seller, I can't figure out, unless it was the topic and the same hope that it would be filled with children's detailed NDEs."
1,Thanks to the reviewers,"I read about the author's arrest a little later than some of the other's. When I searched his book on Amazon, I was amazed at the reviewers touching care to let other's know about the horrendous crime of this sick author. Thank you Amazon reviewers for caring so much about others and informing all of us about the books that should or shouldn't be read. Please keep it up. The information you provide make it a lot easier. My decision to buy any book is influenced by what people have to say. Thanks so much of thinking of this amazing Amazon family. I say just like all the others, DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!!!!"
1,This Author has been arrested,"I haven't read his books on near-death experiences of children. But it's worth noting that Dr. Morse has been arrested (as of Aug 9, 2012) for ""waterboarding"" his daughter repeatedly over two years, as a method of punishment. He has a prior history of arrests involving child maltreatment, according to Delaware's local newspaper."
1,Author Arrested for Waterboarding his 11 yr old daughter,"Melvin Morris, MD was ARRESTED for Child Abuse of his 11 year old daughter in August of 2012. Apparently, Dr. Morris, in his writings, extolls the virtues of the near death experience and believe that experience changes people's lives for the better. One might logically wonder if he has been using his daughter as a test subject, under the guise of discipline.Some of his statements in this book take on new meaning, in light of these Child Abuse charges."
4,Great Book,"This book was a quick read for me. It was interesting, enlightening and even heartwarming! The children tell of seeing the Light- an all-knowing, all-loving being that made them never want to return to their earthly bodies!!"
5,EXCEPTIONAL!,This book is incredibly unique-- I LOVED hearing parenting advice from a child's perspective. This truly puts a new spin on how to raise a happy and well-adjusted child. This book was so easy to read...the chapters are short and to-the-point...giving just enough information in each to help a parent handle each of the frustrations and confusing aspects of parenting. This is a GREAT book and should be a mandatory present for every new parent..their children will thank them!
5,Great parenting tool!,"""Just Me"" was recommended to me as a tool for effective, compassionate parenting that grows smart, loving and respectful kids. Wow. Easy to read and written from a unique perspective, this book should find it's way home to every new parent. I've already bought several for my other new mommy friends. Enjoy!"
5,From a theological perspective. . .,"An outstanding book that clearly outlines the philosophical foundations of the atheist movement. This book will definitely shake the foundation of the unlearned theologian. However, it does present several fatal flaws, such as not separating knowledge and comprehension, assigning all theological thought to a biased definition of agnosticism, and never truly refuting St. Thomas Aquinas and the Summa Theologica. This is a must read for atheist and theist alike!"
5,Excellent non-technical refutation of Christian claims,"The author of this book makes the case that atheism doesn't need to be proven; only that theism, and in particular, belief in the Christian God, simply cannot be deemed acceptable by any reasonable person. The books layout and flow are excellent, with plenty of chapters leading into other larger realms of philosophical inquiry and debate. Certainly an excellent book to give any ""believing"" relatives or friends for Christmas."
1,Materialism.,"As ever the issue boils down to belief, no more no less. If someone chooses to believe that love and the existence of God is no deeper than the chemicals and nerve fibres of the brain, then one could take heed of Smith's arguments.If one is to believe there is a depth to life and to existence, then Smith's arguments will prove to be weak.We are not talking about Santa Claus here. We are talking about the Universal Source of our existence, and the sustaining reality of `being'.Personally, I believe there is a depth to life, and after reading many books on contemporary cosmology, a spiritual dimension in the Universe makes more than good sense. There are things that go way deeper than the nerve fibres and chemicals of the brain, I cannot doubt that. In this sense I feel obliged to search deeper, and I would conclude that Smith's arguments ring ""shallow""."
1,atheism is just plain wrong,"if the author is saying that Christ who is God is not a real person ,then he is wrong. the problem with atheists is that they think highly of themselves as being Jesus Christ. Christ is a very special being, a God, who created every one and this planet-earth along with the other planets. it does not matter whether this author or any other author wrote this book not, atheists tend in general want more and more people to believe in their beliefs-in a God Christ who rules this planet and who cares about everyone of us. a world with atheists, even though, happy atheists, are just people, who at the mention of Christ just get angered. atheist people regardless of their image, social or economic status want to be considered a Christ God, but do fall short alot. author is just plain stupid. people need to believe in Christ"
5,It is the best book on Atheism that I have read!,"He uses great examples to justify his point of view, and he brings up great observations about the gospels. There are the occasional jumps that he doesn't completely justify, but they are very little of them. If you want to learn about Atheism, this is the book for you."
2,boring,"books like this are too shallow. They hold as much weight against Gods existence as a religious fundamentalist holds for Gods existence. Smith succeeds only on a superficial level. His case against God is really a straw man. A religious person, like humility, has nothing to prove."
1,Are You Insane?,"How to Prove God Exists?How come the natural systems make the color yellow, yellow.How come dark is dark. How come we call absence of light dark? How come said absence of dark exists?What created the materials for the big bang?Want to challenge me?E-Mail me at yellowjacket832@yahoo.com"
1,Junk,"As intellectually self-indulgent as atheism itself. Athiests contempt for Christ is unbelievable...well not really. They worship the one who is against Christ and don't even know it. Satan's first lie to us was that we could be like God (decide good/right from evil/wrong). In all our science and ""logic"" patterns, we do not have the capacity to understand what is beyond our natural world. Life is is a miracle. It is infinitly complex and it's design is far beyond our comprehension. Speaking in terms of probability, the odds of the components of a single cell forming by chance is impossible. God is real and He cannot be minimilized away by some guy with a Darwin-Fish on the back of his Volvo."
4,Good Book to grasp the atheist perspective,"I read this during my transition phase. It really makes you think and clearly demonstrates why there are doubts for the existence of the (Christian) God. It gives solid rebuttals to several supposed arguments for God. This book by itself probably won't persuade you one way or the other, but it will challenge your beliefs and adds to the ""debate"" in a civil way."
3,The book is not objective.,The author uses the sale person methodology:he underlines everything which is negative in the product he criticizes (theism) and defends everything which is positive in his product (atheism).This approach makes the author to avoid a lot of complicated issues.
4,Atheism: The Case Against God,"In ""Atheism: The Case Against God"", Smith makes a very good case against God and for atheism. He also shows that many of those who call themselves agnostics really are atheists.He points out many inconsistencies in the Christian god and shows that it can not possibly exist, and also gives many good arguments against gods in general. He makes a good case against faith as an alternative method to reason of acquiring knowledge.The book almost deserves five stars, but it tends to get a bit repetitive at times and some parts are a bit heavy handed. Anyway, this is definately a book that everyone interested in religion or atheism should read."
5,"George is Thoroughly Good, also read SB 1 or God","What I like about the book is that the language flows so well in definition of its premise. This premise has always been very difficult to convey convincingly. George demonstrates the natural process of advancing life which seems to come from a God in the eyes of most humans. Many arguments yes I agree, but this book is one of the best out right now which stresses its point very intelligently. I suggest a very good book which has a surprising premise on this same subject, SB: 1 or God by Karl Mark Maddox."
4,"Regarding the review entitled, ""atheism is just plain wrong""","In your review, you state that Jesus Christ is God. I must ask...when was the last time you read a bible? The version I grew up studying begins with God creating the earth. Jesus, his only son, was born later of the virgin Mary. I would recommend that you attend a remedial bible study course and get your facts straight before you continue your crusade against atheism.As for the Bible, it is nothing but a collection of stories written by people whose aim was to bring order to society by scaring them into thinking that their actions would have consequences from God."
3,A valiant attempt to disprove the existence of God.,"But an ""attempt"" is all it is. The author makes the fatal flaw of trying to prove that God does not exist because no religion can define specifically what ""God"" is. But the author doesn't have a definition either, so it's a double-edged sword. How do you prove something DOESN'T exist if you can't explain what ""it"" is?Author Smith never ventures away from the traditional, limited views of organized religions to question what immense intelligence created the universe. From a flower, to the human brain, to the most distant galaxy...can all of this have come from NOTHING? Now THAT'S something I'd like to read a dispute on."
3,CASE AGAINST GOD?! I THINK NOT!,"I wasn't sure what Atheism meant when I ordered this book. I was drunk at 2am and thought I was ordering a book about the ""A-Team"" 80's TV show. Low and behold there was nothing in this book about about Mr. T or Hannibal. Anyways, this guy doesn't believe that God exist. And he makes a good point that nobody has ever seen God! You would think at least one person would be able to give a sketch composite. We had a pretty accurate drawing of the Una-Bomber and that guy was pretty much MIA. I personally believe in God, and it's not just because I have a tattoo that reads G-O-D on my forehead. Yaay Jesus!"
2,"How do you define ""atheist""?","This book confirms my own experience that most of the people who declare themselves ""atheists"" are in fact ""anti-religionists"" which I think is a much more accurate term. Anyone can focus on the hypocrisy of churchgoers and the unbelievability of miracles which require suspending the laws of thermodynamics--but let's remember that religions are man made. To believe that there is not a creative intelligence in the universe is to believe that an explosion in a print shop can produce Webster's unabridged dictionary. Or, if you are an ""evolutionary"" atheist, that a billion explosions over a million years will in fact produce an unabridged dictionary. Thus argument is more ludicrous than many of the miracles which many religions proclaim."
5,extremely thorough,"This book is one of the most thorough, and logical cases against God that I have read. But be warned, it is a little dry. Even so, I still gave it five stars because it is so well thought out. I challenge any theist, especially Christian theist, to refute the logic in this book."
5,Thanks George Smith for a great book,"I read this book, for the most part, where I work. This morning I got permission to put an ""Atheist"" book at a the headquarters fire station since those of religion have their bibles there already. I would like to do more to promote Atheism in the way that Christians force their religion on US (and other countries) citizens. I don't suppose Christians would allow that though. I am off to buy a copy for the fire station......."
4,Apparently complete source of arguments for non-theism,"Well done for what it is. It is a shame that other proponents of atheism do not read this book and avoid many obvious errors in their denouncement of their detractors (""nature our only example of reality"" being narrow in its positivism and unnecessarily ignorant of metaphysics and ontology). Primary use as a reference book is valuable."
4,Good Job But To Limited Audience,"The author has presented the case of Atheism quite well. The main gist of his work is to establish where the burden of proof lies and I think he has done it perfectly.Apart from that, I don't think that the author has spent much time on the theist assertions. The articles on first cause and design arguments are not very elaborative and lack in their depth.Another thing, which I would like to mention, is that the audience of this book is quite limited. It mainly addresses Christians. Since I belong to another religion, most of the stuff in it was irrelevant to me.I do not agree with the author on many issues but that does not mean that I should diminish the value of the work he has done in this book. It's a well-done book and a good challenge to any theist."
3,Pop Philosophy is O.K.,"This is not a careful work. In the end, it will only convince those already well on the way to atheism. It ignores most of the major work in philosophy of religion going on in the world today. . . seems ignorant of it really. . . but after all it is a pop exploration of a tough topic. As such I sympathize with the limitations. . . if you are adverse to tough books in the field, this is a good place to start."
2,Horrible Book with nothing new to offer,"I was hoping this book would provide me with new insight into atheism, but found myself very disappointed. However the author is knowledgable about the subject and demonstrates his position well.His examination of bible passages was out of sorts with common Christian theology which he must regard to prove his point. The author falled to understand that faith and reason are not divorced from each other. He implies that Christians operate on faith alone which is simply not true. Faith has two sides;one, is that a believer put trust into the object of his/her belief and second, faith is a supernatural event given by god.His first attempt to dispute god by defining the word ""god"" away is simply silly nonsense. The point is that the word ""god"" has meaning and content. The point is that believers know it and use it and understand it. The author should spend less time devoted to redefining words and more time in critical thought."
2,"Good read, riddled with antinomies","A critique of atheistic philosophies cannot substitute for the task of providing a satisfactory theistic philosophy, but it may clear the way for it in the minds of those who are persuaded by one atheistic philosophy or another. A fatally flawed philosophy, however, cannot ground a critique of theism or of any other philosophy. The former's champion may hit upon a fruitful line of criticism, but cannot develop it. Smith's compendium of anti-Christian argumentation, while clearly and even engagingly written, is fatally flawed. Its metaphysics of ""natural necessity,"" epistemology of ""reason,"" and ethics of ""life"" (or ""happiness"") together constitute the philosophy that he adduces in support of his ""critical atheism."" Its internal incoherence, however, disqualifies it as a reasonable basis for affirming or denying anything. For a retailing of Smith's predicament, visit my eponymous site."
4,Still an excellent choice for any CISO and security practitioner,This book has withstood the test of time with respect to the way security affects service level agreements and why security needs to be incorporated into service level management plans and service support for all Fortune 1000 companies.ITIL security guidance should be an adjunct component used with an overall security program and information security framework such as ISO 27001 and 27002 or COBIT.
4,Great for travelling,"We travel a lot and we found the GoGo Kidz Travelmate a great accesory to have while travelling. It's light, easy to use and perfect for gate check in. The only thing, it takes some practice to master it."
4,Great solution,This travelmate made our traveling so much easier!!! I love the fact that I can attach my bulky toddler seat and just run around the airport.
1,not what they say it is,"I was so mad when I got the package. The name for it is ""travelmate cas seat"", well...there was NO CAR SEAT !!!!!!!!!!! It is not worth $78, if it does not include a car seat!!! I was BS!!!"
5,Great item for traveling parents,"I used the GoGo Kidz Travelmate on my sons Britax Roundabout car seat on a recent trip to CA. The GGK Travelmate worked better than expected. We attached this right on the plane and after carrying the carseat off, wheeled my son right to the next flight. It was awesome when we had to run to catch a flight in Houston. Extremely stable and smooth through everything we went through. The GGK Travelmate easily fit in the overhead compartment or under the seat on the planes we were on. My son enjoyed the ride in his own car seat through and around the airport and it was nice not to have to mess around with a stroller. For parents taking their child's carseat along with them, get this item! It will make your airport experience so much easier."
5,Dr Moscowitz continues to amaze.,"Sure, if you want a manufactured, canned review of film and movie creation, then turn away and buy an Ebert book. But if you want an independent review of film by a PhD, then this is your book. Dr. Moscowitz's introduction to film in this book is wonderful. This book covers all facets of film from the review to the documented research paper. An excellent addition to any film class or general reader's library."
2,Useful product but zero support,"I used this product with no problems for a couple oil changesand it was convenient and clean. But then the flexible tubegot a little worn and the flexible plastic sheathing thatcovers the spring steel tube developed several cracks.With the cracks the tube cannot hold a vacuum renderingthe product totally worthless. None of the resellers havea clue about replacement tubes, and Pela themselves aretotally unreachable. Three times in the last year I've gottenzero response to email inquiries and the last email simply bounced.I'd like to recommend this product but can't.If you're going to buy a Pela extractor then get the one withthe hard plastic tubing rather than the more flexible plasticcovered spring steel tubing. The latter will eventually crackand then it's done."
4,A handy oil changer that's well made,"I use this on a VW Jetta and it works well. The dipstick tube is like the flexible sheathing that covers bike brake cables, so it's flexible, but stays on the bottom of the oil pan. You just pump it up and about ten minutes later the oil is drained. Plus, on VWs diesel you can use it to suck out the oil filter casing. I wish it was easier to get all the oil out of the tube, or reservoir after use. Drips can cause stains."
3,"Takes some getting used to, but it does work.","I have a BMW 325ci convertible. First off, the canister holds less oil than my engine does, so it takes two cycles of pulling oil out and emptying the canister, but really, I don't mind that so much. The real trick to this thing is to remove the oil when the oil is at the perfect temperature, not too hot, and not too cold. Too hot and the pickup tube collapses, too cold and the oil is too viscous to pass through the tube vertically. When the oil temp is right it flows quickly, if not, you had better set aside several hours of multitasking elsewhere while changing oil. I had that happen the first time and managed to use the time to do other chores. Also, the hand pump is a little hard to get the hang of, but when you do things will go okay. I would still rather change oil with this pump than to deal with the conventional method. ""Topsiding"" is far more convenient."
1,Junk product. Save your money,"Don't buy it !!! Works OK for the 1st few times, then the seals stop working. save your money."
2,good but needs longer hose,"works well, but for my Chevy Express van in would not reach to the oil, also had some trouble with Honda van, and a mini cooper I had to put it on top of the engine."
2,just okay...,"Maybe it's just me, but this is the second pump I've bought and neither worked well. First I tried a hand pump and no matter how hard I pumped I was only able to remove about 2 quarts. Using this device I got about 3 quarts out but finally had to just give up. Each time I warmed the oil running the engine but the pumps just aren't strong enough to keep a continuous draw going. Unfortunately I don't have the means to get the container lower than the engine. I'd opt for a larger vaccumm vessel next time."
3,Gets the job done... kinda.,"I got this to remove oil from my 2006 VW Jetta TDI. It removes it, but not as I thought it would. It takes about 20 minutes to remove 4.5 liters of hot/warm oil. I need to begin suction 2-3 times to empty the oil from the car. Bottom line, it gets the job done."
5,Pella Oil Extractor,"Excellent product. I use it to change oil in both my cars and my lawn tractor.Oil draining with the extractor is slower than just pulling a drain plug, but is a lot easier and cleaner. Avoiding the crawling under the car to open the crankcase drain plug is worth the price of this extractor."
3,Book review,This item should have been listed as fair. It seems to be quite used but readable. It did come in a timely manner.
2,Not so great,"I wanted to love this book! A huge fan of romantic mysteries, I saw the teaser about this series and couldn't wait to dig in. In the end, I was disappointed. It's far too close to Stephanie Plum without Stephanie's realness or Evonovich's voice."
4,I like this series,"This is the second book of the Pauline Sokol series and I think it is better than the first. Pauline is a tired, burnt out nurse ( I can relate!), who has a job as an insurance fraud investigator thanks to her roommates greesy uncle...which she kind of sucks at. Many funny situations arise from Paulines investigative techniques and we get to learn a little bit more about the mysterious Jaggar that Pauline is secretly, or not so secretly, obsessed with. She gets herself into many funny situations with him, one involving Viagra, which are sure to leave you laughing outloud.This book could easily read as a stand alone, but if you like this one, you are mostly likely going to enjoy the first.Happy Reading!"
4,Good lamp for the price.,"I purchased 3 of these for my home. For the price, they are as good as it gets, or at least that is what I found after looking around. While I recognize tastes vary, my wife and I were looking for ""classic english style furniture"" and this lamp has the nicest design we found out there, for that kind of money. The whole stand is not one part, but actually more than one screwed over each other, but the lamp is sturdy enough and craftmanship is more than reasonable for the price. The packaging we received it in was great: a lot of effort put into preventing any kind of damage to the lamps during shipping. All in all, I would purchase again."
2,Don't Bother,"Unless you don't have Bad Day somewhere else, don't bother with this one. The B-sides are pretty lame. The first is a pure throw-away and the second in a static, boring instrumental."
2,"Sorry guys, but this doesn't make it","I'm A Streisand fan for thirty years, and like all of us, go with the ups and downs of her career. Album wise, she has done different things, not always good, but they always kept coming and caught our interest. This album in the late eighties is... just forgettable, sorry to say. Besides the Legrand song which is a well written melody, none of the songs are good. The arrangements have no distinction whatsoever and Barbra tries her best, but cannot elevate this material. Much of the lyrics are just embarrasing and very few are the moments that give a thrill (the choir in ""Places"" for instance, why not a whole album with Quincy? You would also think Bachrach could write better songs for her!). Barbra can sing these songs thru her sleep, but no reason why such a chaliber like Streisand really has to settle for this material."
3,TILY is not a great album,"I like Barbra Streisand. She is probably the best pop vocalist of the century and I have a lot of her albums but...... this album is so boring.....well, is not bad..., but is not very good...all the songs sounds the same, is an easy album....her singing is very good (as always) but the songs aren't .....I can't understand why after her masterpieces she mades this kind of boring pop easy listening ballad albums (after guilty, emotion and after the broadway album, till i loved you). This album is for you if you love Streisand and want all her work...if you want a great album by this great singer buy : guilty, a star is born, higuer ground, the broadway album, the concert, one voice, yentl, funny girl, people, the barbra streisand album.....In conclusion, the world can live with or without this album (i's not essential).(Why a duet with Don Johnson, Barbra? )"
3,No where near her best,"This album is for people who like Kenny G, Andrea Bocelli, Yanni and other fluffy pop-like music. Barbra being the marketing genius she is no doubt thought she could cash in on the trend to muzak that was(and unfortunately still is) sweeping the nation when this album was made. On those merits she does quite well. But no where does one feel the tingly thrill one can feel on earlier streisand albums. The songs are all bland and similar. The duet with Don Johnson is interesting only because it shows that even a smart women like Barbra can make bad decisions when they're in love."
3,Till I Loved you,Found this older Streisand music on a cassette and wanted to have access to it for a longer period of time knowing the tape will fall apart very soon. Good music but nothing as good as I know she is capable of.
2,Great Concept. Poor Construction,"In the picture, it looks great. The wire top with access is great to soothe a possibly stressed out animal. When I got it in the mail, I could have sworn i was missing a piece of plastic along the edge. The top and bottom didn't seem to close right. And the slide knobs used to open and close the kennel did not glide smoothly across. I had to force. In concept, this would have been a perfect carrier for my rabbit. But i found it to be cheaply made with thin plastic and plastic knobs that don't even slide smoothly because the mold of the kennel is so poorly made."
5,Hold up well. Takes abuse,We use these to take care of orphaned and injured wildlife. We keep the baby animals in these and use them to transport to the vet. They get a lot of use from us and they hold up very well. We have found that these kennels are the best product for what we do.
5,Great for a parrot. You can put a sall perch inside!!!,"Bought for a parrot to travel in. It comes in two styles. This one has the top with wire grating, the other is just more plastic. This was super because the bird and I could have eye contact easily to reassure him and make sure everything looked safe inside, plus he gets a lot of light, unless I cover it with a small towel."
1,not used,this item was way to small for my cat who weighs 8 lbs. her tail didnot fit in and she couldnot stand up
5,Better than My Mom's,I was pleasantly surprised by how good this instant oatmeal tasted. I was not expecting such great flavor and texture. There seemed to be apple bits that plumped up nicely and give this instant oatmeal a feel of something more.I have tried many different instant oatmeals and this one of the best I have ever eaten.
1,Cheesy zen garden,"The garden is beyond miniature. It is minute, and the rake is very cheap looking. Sorry, I wasted my money.It is more of a toy."
1,its half the size of a dollar bill!!!!,i wish i would have read the reviews before buying this. i was looking for a couple mini gardens to mix together as a gift. the first i got was about the size of an average textbook and this one is half the size of a dollar bill!!!THE RAKE IS SMALLER THAN MY PINKIEthere is really no way to fully enjoy the art of zen gardening with this kit. nice idea but no...
4,Excellent Little Guide that Fits in Your Bag,"This is a very good little guide that highlights some hotspots of berlin including their U-Bahn or S-Bahn stop to help you easily get there. Berlin is one of those cities that it is impossible to see everything so it was nice to have a synopsis of some of the biggies. I also used the guide to find specific shops to find a few specialty things like marzipan and some natural face products. I did not, however, use it for eating. I did not find that part particularly helpful. Mainly I liked the compact size that fit into my bag without weighing me down."
1,Wasted Money,This product is drastically overpriced for what it delivers. It is shallow and simplistic and will do little or nothing to enhance your Berlin visit. I put it in the trash after only a day!
5,Perfect for shorter people!,I am only 5' tall and reaching over the counters to the garbage disposal switch was always a challenge!So I had my husband install this air switch at the front of cabinet right under the sink...PERFECT!Now I just reach down to quickly turn on or off the garbage disposal!So easy to install - works with existing plug under sink!LOVE IT! Great product!
3,Read the directions carefully,"I would give this product 5 stars, except for one thing: the size of the hole that it uses. For some reason, the two that I bought through Amazon required a slightly smaller hole for the button than the ones one might purchase at HD or elsewhere. So when my contractor drilled holes in the granite countertop ""using the same drill bit I always use"", the buttons literally fell through the holes! We tried jerry-rigging them, but eventually went to HD and bought new buttons that used normal sized holes."
2,Pay attention!,Don't buy this package if you need a brushed nickel button because it is not in it!The package that costs a little more has the 3 colors for the button.
4,"Works perfectly, minor quality issue","It does it's job perfectly and looks great. I had to drill a hole through my stainless steel sink. Preprepared for this to be very difficult. Get a high quality bi-metal blade and use cutting oil. Take it slow, and give your drill opportunity to cool down every so often.The only other problem I had was the silver disk around the button. It came off the plastic piece that is threaded around the center button. Whatever adhesive they used didn't hold. Super glue solved that problem."
1,Buyer Beware,"While this InSinkErator STS-00 SinkTop Switch kit looks like the one in the box stores, it did not have the nickel-finished collar in the package like the ones in the box stores."
3,Product Description is WRONG! Do not order if you want satin nickel finish!,"The description under the product features states that it ""Includes chrome, satin nickel and white buttons and rings"" but it ONLY comes with the Chrome and White buttons as displayed in the picture.If you want the Satin Nickel finish you need to order the following:InSinkErator STS-SO Single Outlet Sink Top Switch with Chrome, Satin Nickel and White Buttons"
3,Check the picture rather than description,"This package arrived quickly; I soon noticed that it included two buttons only - white and chrome. The product description says (unless they have updated it since then) there are three buttons included - white, chrome and satin nickel. For our new kitchen I needed satin nickel to better match the faucet and stainless steel sink. Amazon was fine about me returning the item. Since then I have found a single outlet air switch http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001DELK2Y/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00 that hopefully (description and photo) DOES include a satin nickel button!"
2,package description is wrong,"This was described as coming with a satin nickel ring; it does not. Now I have to deal with that.Product FeaturesFor use with all disposersFor use when a wall switch is not availableIncludes chrome, satin nickel and white buttons and rings18-inch power cord and 24-inch air lines includedMust have AC power below sink"
3,Wish the bronze would have come as part of the deal,Love the approach and have been using it for 9 months with out any issues. This model has two outlets that you can plug into. The system toggles which outlet is on when you actuate the pnematic switch.Dinged it 1 for the cost. Dinged it a second one because I had to order the bronze face plate separately. For the price it should have come with it.This is a far safer approach then having to bend down and flip a switch under the island sink. I would recommend it to others.
1,do not buy,"Save your money and buy something else. The sound seems to come through a couple of straws: thin, no bass, no ""presence."" Worst of all, I can't return them. The Koss earbuds with the foam are the best I've come across for the price, even though they can be fussy."
1,DO NOT BUY,Do not be fooled by the 'iPod' compatible written on the front.This is the worst headsets I ever bought. Make drums sound like somebody is taping on an empty saucepan!
1,Worst headphones ever,"Got these in Walgreens, took them back within 5 minutes! I am dead serious, i have bought the 97 cent ear buds from walmart and the sound was better! no bass whatsoever came through these, and although they are very comfortable, i'd say 90% of what i want an earphone for is sound quality. I was very surprised by these, and this is the only reason i am writing a review, i ussually don't."
1,Abysmal Sound,"It's hard to believe Maxell thought these were acceptable to market. They have abysmal, muted sound with no brightness or dynamics whatsoever. It's like listening to music through a mattress. They're far inferior to their own EB225 ear buds, which sell for half the price.I can think of only two positive points. The first is that the soft rubber earcaps fit comfortably and snugly in the ear. The other, oddly enough, is that I'm hearing A LOT LESS noise and static through them that is apparently caused by the fluorescent light transformers overhead in the ceiling at my gym. (Go figure.) So, for the single reason that I can get better reception while I'm working out, I didn't return them."
3,depends on what you use them for,"The best thing about these earphones are the adjustable volume (sometimes you just don't want to pull out the device you're using and adjust the, sometimes inconvenient, system volume). OK, like everybody's said, you might not use this for jamming Daft Punk at the loud gym. Also the the wiring inside the earbud won't last too long. Yet, I bought a replacement set (in an emergency) at the drug-store for $25 (what a rip-off); and, I'm getting 2 backups here, right now.Well, I was going to but found a similar product I would not have to pay extra shipping for. I like a slider volume control better than a wheel (which can get adjusted, blasting your ears out, on you while you move around)."
3,Worth the money,"I paid about $10 for these earbuds to use with my mp3 player when I am walking/jogging. Mostly, I listen to podcasts of radio programs. They are comfortable, and I find the inline volume control very useful as I don't have to fiddle with the mp3 player to adjust the volume. I sometimes listen to music when walking/jogging, and they are fine for that task also. If you expect extraordinary sound for $10, you will be disappointed. However, I have been using these earbuds 4-7 times a week for over a year for walking/jogging and am quite pleased with them."
5,a wonderful book,This wonderful new book fills a gap. It enables readers to put themselves into the many different worlds Jewish women occupied over time and compare our lives today to those lived in times past. I highly recommend it as a good read and a fabulous reference book.
3,good cover but not waterproof,"Covers a double 20# propane tank setup. Is not waterproof, inside of cover and top board do get and retain water. Does dress up the tanks appearence."
4,Good Protection For Your Tanks,This cover is a great way to keep your tanks out of the sun and away from junk floating in the air. It hold on pretty well while the trailer is being towed also. the only negative thing i can say is that it tends to pick up little stains pretty fast from just sitting there. Just gotta clean it often I guess...
5,perfect fit,"Purchased these for our 1 year old RV propane tanks, since the tanks are looking a little scratchy. The fit is perfect, the material is smooth and glossy and won't hold mildew or pollen discoloration. I like the board that fits into the lid of the cover to keep it level."
4,ok quality,cheap price...ok quality. whiter and softer vinyl than most. Sorta looks like a diaper. Fine because these covers never last to justify an expensive price.
5,DAVID PRODUCTS ARE THE BEST,"David Seeds Pumpkin Seeds, 5-Ounce Bags (Pack of 12)THESE ARE MY GIRLFRIENDS DIET REGIMENT. SHE LOST 20 LBS EATING THESE WHILE WORKING AS A HR BENEFITS SPECIALIST."
3,pumpkin seed review,this item came up on amazon at the right time i was getting tired od s seeds and was craving pumpkin seeds
2,"Too Salty, not shucked",I've discovered that these have too much salt on the shells and not enough inside. I personally would prefer shelled pumpkin seeds (so that the salt is on the kernel). It would also be less work. =)My wife liked them at first but the 12 pack ended up being too much for her since I wasn't eating them too.
2,Not Labelled As Containing the Shells,"Obviously you can't tell from a picture whether pumpkin seeds have the shell on or not, so we assumed since they were salted that they were probably without the shell. Well, if you buy these, I hope you are the type that likes eating pumpkin seeds shells (we aren't). The seeds themselves were not very large and the shells were not easy to open. I was very disappointed. These, in my opinion, are only useful if you like eating the shell and all."
3,Way too salty,"I give these three stars because the quality is good and, apart from the salt, they taste great. But they are way too salty. Is there a low salt version out there?"
5,Yummy for the tummy!!!,"OMG, I am so glad to finally be able to get these delights in bulk! They stay fresh almost forever and are super delicious!!"
5,Great snack!,Pumpkin seeds are my favorite snack and buying by subscription ensures I always have a supply. The David Pumpkin Seeds are great!
3,Informative history,Good history of Blair County. But very long winded and difficult to find information sometimes. Prefer other history novels about PA.
4,The Sacremento Bomb sack,"With songs like Had 2 gat ya,lose a hoe gain a hoe,and the tightest Walkin 2 my funeral this is Sacremento at its best.One of the few N.Cali Classics."
5,first album is the best,"ok here it goes, ive been into brotha lynch fo a while and this is by far his best cd, along with season of da sickness becuz that takes it to a whole new level. 24 deep was made in 1993, no rapper in 1993 could even touch this ... even now. wit songs like lose a hoe gain a hoe, they are bomb songs. lynch has the best beats around, along wit mr. doc and x-raided, and all his west coast homies, these instant classics, cant wait for another lynch CD so it can be off the hook"
5,1972-1993,"Brotha Lnych`s first Album was crazy. He even dedicated it in memory of himself(see booklet to know what i`m Talking about). The album contains about 9 tracks,2 are Interludes and 1 is an Introduction so their are about 6 actual songs.My Favorites are:Had 2 Gat Ya,Walkin 2 My Funeral,24 Deep and Back Fade"
1,Terrible,The wire is a very stiff piece of metal sort of serrated part that can I would be polite in saying in absolute emergencies can be used to cut pieces of wood. Although your hand and arm might as well fall off while in the process of cutting because of fatigue. I would say a waste of money.
1,Recall this item!,"What a piece of garbage.Coleman should recall this saw or change the label to christmas ornament.The reason people buy these is for emergency/survival situations.Thank god i test everything first.I started to cut a 1 inch branch,about a quarter of the way through it began to smoke.I stopped to see what was going on and the saw was so hot it burned my hand.I waited for it to cool down then tried again.Not even half way through the saw became so hot it broke in half.Unless you plan on hanging this from your christmas tree do not buy it."
3,Product?? Service was great,The product is less than hoped for but the vendor was terrific. . . . . . . . .
1,Garbage,Took a flyer on this before heading to REI for a real saw. It's a piece of junk. It kinks up and is unable to cut through even a one inch diameter branch. If I could give it 0 stars (or even negative stars) I would.
1,"DO NOT, Repeat DO NOT BUY THIS!","I bought this saw and I'm so glad I tried it out before I put it in my back pack. I tried to saw through a 1"" (if that) stick and just seconds into the cut this JUNK broke in half. One half curled up and slapped me on the wrist and I now have a scar from it. Returned it that day. The days of Coleman being a good brand are long long gone. Move on to something else and don't waste your money. I would give this a negative star if I could."
5,Have a busy life?,"If you have a busy life, like myself, or even if you are just a little lazy, these liners are for you! I never tried anything like this until I bought these a few months ago. They definitely make changing the cat litter a lot quicker. LOVE these!!"
5,Great Idea,"Fantasy Pet Products Sift Clean Disposable Litter Sifting Liners (28 sifting liners)This is a wonderful idea... no more ""scooping"" cat poop. Wish it was around a long time ago."
3,SIFTING LITTER LINERS,Fantasy Pet Products Sift Clean Disposable Litter Sifting Liners (28 sifting liners)PRODUCT ARRIVED ON TIME LINERS ARE A LITTLE THIN & SOMETIMES TEAR BUT THERE ARE SO MANY IT DOESN'T MATTER YOU JUST USE THE NEXT ONE. MAKES LITTER BOX CLEANING EASIER & MORE ECONOMICAL AS LIITER LASTS LONGER. THEY HAVE ANOTHER PRODUCT WITH LESS IN THE PKGE THAT MAY BE STRONGER I WILL TRY THAT NEXT TIME. I HIGHLY RECCOMMEND THIS PRODUCT
1,Did not work for me at all,No matter how much litter was put on top of these liners our cat ripped them up every time. Not worth the trouble.
4,"Excellent historical perspective, both sacred and secular","Kimbrough provides an excellent glimpse into 19th century Indiana and the early history of the Tarkington family. In addition, he offers detailed insight into the chronology of the evolution of Methodism. If you're looking for a strict biography of Joseph Tarkington only, this is not the read for you, but if you're looking for a good understanding of the Methodist religion, you'll find it here."
5,Doesn't clog poors,"I have been using this product for a few months and find that it makes my skin feel healthy and look healthy. It doesn't do anything for fine lines or wrinkles you may have, but I think it probably does help in the prevention category. I have an icky oily complexion and the wrong products make me break out. That is not a factor with this product. Recommended for maintaining healthy glow. If you want to get rid of fine lines, use a product with Retinol A."
1,paraben free derma q gel coq10 anti wrinkle skn energizing formula,I want my money back. The cream is extremely irritating. I couldn't even place the cream near my eyes. I tried to use the cream under my my eyes they turned blood shot. to try and use this all over the face is impossible.
4,Excellent value,"Wow, $28 plus shipping shared with other parts.Previously paid $145 for one back in 1998 and $99 for one in 2004.Retail they now go for $50 to $80.Fit like the original and bearing was on par with what arrived in my clutch kit.Rated 4 out of 5 stars as I did have trouble getting the hydraulic line to hook up. There was a bent finger in the coupling spring lock. (Have no idea if it arrived that way or if I caused it during assembly)Ended up having to use the coupling spring lock from the old unit.Bled system once and has worked perfectly from the first road test on."
4,Fun adventures & clever activities,"My 5-yr. old daughter loves this game! She particularly likes the shipwreck activity with Grover, where you have to help Grover and his helper, a cute little clam, get from room to room via various silly mechanical devices (this one's a logic & prediction type activity). And she always giggles at Elmo and Miss Octopus's garden, in a pattern-matching game that she mastered and gets a lot of satisfaction from.The backstory also helps keep her interested; she loves collecting the deep-sea junk for Oscar and seeing what his junk machine turns it into.Great game by the folks at Sesame. Always fresh. (Works best under Win98 and WinME; had varied success under XP and doesn't run under 2000 at all.)"
1,Lame!,"First off, I love Star Wars....but...This DVD is so awful!The animation is terrible and the storylines are so completely boring and pathetic. Don't buy this DVD unless you enjoy ANYTHING Star Wars and have a very, very, very low IQ. I'm sure maybe then you wont mind it in that case. The Clone Wars Vol. 1 series is the only animated Star Wars DVD I've seen that respects the material and the characters in.My personal version of hell would be getting tied to a chair and being forced to watch this DVD on repeat!"
5,Makes Me Feel Like An Expert,"Before we catch fish we must find them. Mr. Rosenbauer tell us how in great depth. He describes every kind of water found in rivers, and where we are most likely to find trout. This book has great illustrations, so throughout the fishing season it's easy to quickly review the essentials of reading the water of streams and rivers.I don't see how anyone could write a better book on this subject. This is one of my favorite technical fly fishing books."
3,Heaven Sent Gladys Knight & the Pips,"If a one of Gladys Knight & the Pips should be on the greatest hits cd, you need to have ""Heaven Sent"". I remember my mom had this on cassette and I wore it out. Gladys tore this song up!!! It was on the same album with ""Save the Overtime for Me"". I am still looking for this on cd or just buy the original cd. If you just listen to the verse, you would be in tears."
4,Taste of Gladys Love,"This is a good compilation, but it only gives the listener a taste of what is on the great albums from which these songs originate. If you want just a sample of Gladys Knight and the Pips at their best, this CD will do. If you want to be really entertained by these fantastic artists, go get the entire library of these albums. Especially ""About Love"" and ""Visions""."
1,Never got it!,"Unfortunately we never received this item. So much for international relations. Patience is a virtue and a necessity with international trade. We know this because we have a website selling vinyl recordings, and most of our buyers are from Europe and Asia. Because of the lack of performance, we cannot recommend doing business with this vendor."
1,Don't waste your money,"I love the TrekStor Vibez...the sound quality is outstanding. However, the FM Tuner Expansion Card is as bad as the MP3 player is good. I don't think it could pick up a radio signal if you were standing right next to the station's transmitter. I was very disappointed and ultimately sent it back to Amazon to get my money back. Amazon handled the return very well, promptly crediting my credit card."
1,Not worth it,"So far, I haven't been able to receive any kind of radio signal with the vibez. I know there are some decently powerful stations that I can pick up with an old tape player/radio, but the vibez just can't seem to cut it. I can sweep through the entire spectrum and not pick up a single station. The tuner card inserts fairly easily and snaps in reassuringly, but you're unlikely to actually pick up any stations. The signal bars are there and one or two may be filled, but its apparently never enough for the thing to actually put the sound through."
4,Good Basic FM radio,"I, for one, like modularized features such as this FM radio for the Trekstor Vibez. It was easy to install and performs pretty well. That said, the radio is not nearly as sensitive as, let's say, the radio already built into Creative Zen Vision. I get about half the stations with this as compared to the Zen. Of course, the radio in the Zen is far better than average. How can you complain though? If you want an FM radio and own the Vibez, this one's for you."
1,a shirt only for one ride ..,"what a waste of money ..I just had this shirt for only one ride and guess what, the wind torn the sleeve off and the fabric of the shirt goes off layer by layer that once I reached home the torn reached to my backtoo much for 40$ .."
4,Dragonfly Biker Shirts,"Love the Shirt, I've scored 5 of them so far. Delivery within 2-3 days after placing my order. My only problem with these shirts is that they have No Pockets which is a problem for me being a smoker- I need a place to keep my cigarettes which is why I only gave this product a 4 star rating."
5,Value and Power for under $400,"A few weeks ago I was shopping around for a a new camcorder to replace my sony video recorder from 1985. Since it had been so long since I had done any shopping I carefully weighed my options. Hi8 creates an almost 40% clearer and sharper image than regular 8mm. I don't have the equipment to connect my pc to a dv camcorder.After careful consideration and a few visits to my closest electronics shop I realized that this product was the easiest, most affordable Hi8 and I love using it. I would recommend this to anyone on a budget that has a desire to create quality video with ease and precision."
2,Pretty Bad,I received this camera last night and am returning it this morning. Very disappointing. The picture on my 5 year old VHS-C camera is a lot better. In low light it is grainy and colors are washed out. The speaker on the camera is barely audible. Could be just a defective unit but it is going back. Expected much more from Sharp.
2,Typical 70's Blackexplotation film,Not a bad film. Not great either. William Smith is killed. Now you know all you need to know.
3,Wrong product,When I tried to order filters GE informed me that they had been replaced by these FXUSC filters. Absolutely wrong! These filters are too tall and are not string. They will never work in my water softener. That is nothing wrong on the side of Amazon but rather on the side of GE who obviously don't know their own products!
5,things i forgot,this book was so good because we did not go into depth in my history class so we did not learn of much of the pacific theatre of operations.we only learnt about island hopping and the atomic bomb.i really enjoyed the side pannels that explained stuff about certain people. this book was awesome
3,Put the events in order !,"If you are new to WWII, read this book. It provides a great overview.It would be a five star book if it was put in chronological order. My only complaint is that it keeps jumping around, back & forth from 1941 to '44 back to '40 etc. For a good chronological overview of WW2 go to wikopedia & search 'WW2 Timeline""."
5,Great Book,This was a really good read. I'll have to pick up Pure Chance - The book where sam is introduced.
3,Enjoyable,"This is a small book with the artists experience and some instructional content on her water color journaling. It is enjoyable and inspiring, and I liked it but in my opinion about twice the price it should be for what you get ."
5,Really Like 'A Petoskey Watercolor Journal'!,"I have had Catherine Carey's lovely book, 'A Petoskey Watercolor Journal', for a while and continue to pull it down off the bookshelf to read and reference frequently. Her depictions of Petoskey are so charming that I am seriously considering visiting and, hopefully, take a class with Catherine. This book has been so helpful to me in creating a watercolor journal. Enjoy!"
5,EXCELLENT! The best children's book ever!,Grrreat book! We thoroughly enjoyed it. Richard Scarry books are childhood companions that will undoubtedly remain favorites for many generations.It's great how Lowly learns where he truly belongs.
5,Good Buy,"I'm a fabricator/welder,and have used this die grinder for a little while at work primarily for smoothing welds prior to paint and cleaning rough edges on free hand holes.It's a nice little grinder for clean up work.It's comfortable to use and is nice to have a rubberized sleeve.Would not recommend this for heavy shop applications as it is a smaller unit and not built for it.Would buy again."
4,Cute interactive book,"My friends little one enjoyed this, as a beginning reader, he was happy to do a little reading and some looking at pictures. He was more interested in reading because this was an interactive puzzle just right for his age (5)!"
2,Improvement needed,"I was disappointed in two areas. The first time I tried to order the book I didn't realize it was a paperback. When I did realize it - the same day I placed the order - it was too late to cancel it. When I finally found the hard cover book, I received it and found out it was a very small book. I do think something should have been mentioned that the book size was small. I already conveyed this message to the seller. J. Goulette"
4,Good - but hard to 'read'!,"Excellent collection of logos organized by subject, ie: buildings, letterforms, text, etcHowever, it lacks any real information on the actual companies these logos were made for. Names are rarely descriptive enough.I guess this book is more about cramming logos in than describing the process - so I forgave this one.What I won't forgive is the incredibly confusing 'design' of the information grid at the bottom of each page telling you which logo belongs to who.It is incredibly confusing.It's badly designed.It's a shame to see bad design in a DESIGN book.simple numbers would have done instead of the Row A, column 3 grid system they used. It's needlessly complex.Regardless, it's quantity and quality over that nitpick.A lot of good logos. Very little filler.Surprising, given the hit and miss of a lot of similar books."
3,What's up with the numbering system???,Very good book. Gives me lots of inspiration for logos. But it sure doesn't look like they had anyone proof their logo numbering system. Please fix it in the 2000 More Logos book!
5,Logos and more Logos!,If your looking for ideas on logos or a reference book on logos then this is the best book I have found so far on the subject. It also has quite a few examples that show how certain design firms came up with logo ideas for their clients. This book is not for someone who is more interested in letterhead or business card design.
1,Ironic...,"It's ironic that a book about design can be so painfully and poorly designed. It is so difficult figure out which logo goes with which client. I got fed up with trying to read the miniscule type at the bottom of the page and sick of trying to figure out if i was looking at logo 1c or 1d. There is such a wealth of information and great design in this book, but they have made it incredibly difficult to access. So frustrating!!!"
3,Great little book,This is a great little book - but it is definitely pocket sized - I find the bigger versions are better value - get more designs per page :). Considering the price you get what you pay for. Good quality and always great content!
2,wrong shipment?,"hello I received the LogoLounge 2, but the mini-variant, not the big book. I also ordered logolounche 3, which went good, I mean I really received the big-one."
2,Get their first record,"After We're Not Laughing With You, I was stoked for this to come out and bought it without listening to it. That was a mistake.Gone are the melodic hardcore hooks from the first album, and in place is just fast, generic music, without a soul.I think punk rock is the most dynamic musical genre but all the songs on this album sound the same.Heckle displayed so much talent with their first record but had nothing left for round two, and appropriately called it quits after this album."
5,the editroralist below me is on CREAK COCAIN,"this cd is great. and has a very distinct sound to it. the first cd is may be better however, out of ten this probably is a 9.5 the other HECKLE(were not laughing at you) would be a ten. melodic hardcore with a distinct sound. you may enjoyOTHER HECKLE HAS BACK UP VOCALS FROM DAVE OF A.F.I."
3,In contrast to that other review...,"This is by no means original hardcore, in thought or in musical prowess. It does have good breakdowns and some keen sing-a-long choruses, but many of the songs run together, which is good if you like the record but a serious fault if you dont."
4,Acid Free Product,Clear binding edge - loads easily - acid free Works for my filing system. I like that it's clear and not opaque.
2,These are NOT what I think of as heavyweight,"Not heavyweight compared to the heavyweight I buy at Staples, by a long shot. I'd hate to see their 'lightweight'.In fairness, maybe this is what heavyweight IS these days."
4,Good quality,"I use these to protect important documents, some of which are very old, for my family research. The opening to put papers into it is at the top and large enough to easily slide in 8.5 X 11 pages, but not too large to be awkward."
2,My god is this boring,This book is more like a history book then a story. It fills your head with facts that you will forget the next page and doesnt do anything to keep your attention. every chapter is divided by the story of a different person or event. And since their is five chapters it makes you have to start reading at what feels like the beginning of a book every chapter. Really hard to keep on track with all the facts and storys being thrown at you.
3,Funny,"What I do not like about the book is that it focusses a little too much on the political history of the town rather than on the people who made up the population. A little time was spent on the initial Chinese American population, but more time could have been spent on those and other immigrant cultures that have historically made up the city.Even so, it's still worth the effort. It is a fun read, and, though dated, it still kept me laughing unexpectedly over and over again."
5,Never Ever without it!,"This product is a MUST HAVE at our house. I have all white sheets and towels, and they must be white! This is the ONLY product I have EVER found that accomplishes this. FOLLOW the directions, and DO NOT use in same load with bleach or oxyclean-- this is CLEARLY written on the label. It is NOT a general purpose stain remover, use pretreat for that. But it DOES get your dingy whites WHITE, exactly like the product name says!"
5,Great!!,One of the best girl adventure books I have ever read and I hope there are more books to follow it! I would recommend this book to anyone thaat likes adventure and mystery stories!
4,You're only young once...,"I picked up this book because it looked like something light I could read on the plane. Wow, this was not a light book! The book is about Lana Spiggs, a 15 year london girl who just wants to be treated like an adult. She dreams of a perfect husband, and four kids, all in a perfect house with a play hut out the front. She thinks that being a famous actress would be ok, too. But after a fight with her mother on her 15th birthday, she meets Les, a pretty ok looking guy twenty year old guy with a job. She tells him she's 18 and they get together. Soon, they're jumping into bed. And after that Lana realises: she's pregnant. She keeps the baby, (which she calls Shinola, a brand of shoe polish) but Les never seems to be around and Lana finds out that adulthood might not be so great after all. This book really sticks with you and is good for 13-16 year olds."
1,good price if you are mechanically inclined,"after only 50 hours of operation, we have had six failures that each took the genny off line until repair1) bad / undersized battery2) stuck open AC breaker3) stuck closed fuel solenoid4) leaking fuel filter / shutoff & poor quality unsafe fuel lines5) failed AVR - voltage regulator6) blown silencer & leaking muffler..oddly the silencer packing caught fireadd to that a 20 hour break-in initial run period, mandatory valve adjustments, and extremely poor fitting air filter housing.Make sure you run it far from your house as ours caught fire. Only good things are price & efficient running at about 1/2 gallon per hour"
4,Best in years,"Remakes but better than the originals. The music enhances her voice and makes it more distinctive. The songs stay with you. ""Down To My Last Broken Heart"" is a classic. Getting lots of play on XM and you will see why."
2,lasts about 2yrs,"bought 3 years ago. battery always sucked but entire thing died today (despite trying all the ""trouble-shooting"" tips Apple offers on website). very disappointing considering i paid $300 bucks for 3 years ago. AVOID simply for the miserably short battery life alone. almost missing my old walkman."
3,"Great sound, but terrible battery life, among others things","I bought this ipod a few months ago... It's design is really nifty, and cool, and the sound quality is almost flawless... But after a while I started to notice it barely lasted a day of use (about 4-5 hours) WHAT BS!!! I also have run out of room... I had thought that 4gigs was enough, but I was wrong... I am greatly considering selling mine, and getting the new ipod colour 20gig (the battery life is supposedly better)... If you're not going to use your ipod all that much, and are sure you are gonna put less than 4gigs of music on, get it, but otherwise go for the 20gig."
4,I finally caved & bought one.,"I love my iPod - it gives me something to do while walking from my apartment to school everyday. I like to pretend it's the soundtrack to my life. :) My only complaint is that the ear pieces don't fit very well in my ears (maybe I have small ears, I don't know). Sometimes they fall out, unless I really wedge them in there."
2,HeadPhones Sucks,"Hello, i'm writting form Venezuela. I had bought a MiniIpod from Amazon. I have had it for about 3 days... Using it at the gym... and surprise the rigth earphone stop working, now i have an Mono Mini Ipod... Customer Support from apple.com... forget it. I recomend you to buy an aditional pair of headphones.Regards. IT MCP/MSCE/CCNA Arnaldo Roque."
1,not for anyone on the go,"The battery life is awful. The first one I bought lasted about 2.5 hours, even though I was very careful to follow the instructions because I'd heard that it could be a problem. I returned it before the first 30 days were up and got a new one. It seemed to be much better at around 5 hours of use, but has since declined to around 4.The controls are also incredibly difficult to use with any accuracy. I thought I would get used to spinning the wheel, but I continue to have trouble selecting exactly what I want if I am walking or doing anything other than sitting at my desk.I had two Rio sports before this one and thought I'd be better off with more capacity but it's turned out to be a great disappointment."
3,ipod mini,The first ipod mini I got didn't work - very frustrating. Apple help line was wonderful but couldn't fix it so they suggested I return it to Amazon for a replacement. I had my new ipod mini in 2 days (thanks Amazon) and it works great. Happy ending.
1,Malfunction,The item was mailed and received quite promtly. The operation of the item (I-pod Mini)was unsatisfactory. The battery life was short lived and eventually it would not work at all.
2,Bad Luck,"I believe it was bad luck, but out of the box one of earbuds didn't work right. I called customer service and they told me that it probably was due to being dropped and they could not replace them. I had to buy a new pair."
3,Cool Little Gadget,"I'm glad I bought this mini. When it first came out I thought it overpriced. I'm not really into gadgets. But after the nano I thought prices would come down, as they did. Earphones are pretty good compared to another smaller mp3 player I got. Cool, hip, and trendy, yet without the features that I really needed (voice recorder, FM tuner, line-in recorder) It is still too big for me to carry in public, so I bought a smaller iAudio with features needed. Coupled with a pair of miniature speakers my mini now serves as a nicely designed alarm clock in my bedroom."
1,Don't buy an iPod,"I just returned my iPod to the Apple Store... no refund, no exchange simply left it at the store. This is the worst piece of electronic I hav EVER purchased and my first and last Apple product.In a nut-shell... the iPod would skip what was downloaded from iTunes... go figure, another Apple product. I have reset the factory settings numerous times, reloaded the software... I sync it with my PC and it works briefly, only to start skipping again. And, of course, when I bring it in today (the 3rd time) it works, so there's NOTHING Apple can do, except to advice me to come back when it happens again.Well, that's it for me and Apple. I don't have the time, nor the energy to keep going back to the store whenever the iPod ""acts up"".Jan"
2,Less for More,"Just when you think it doesn't get any better, it doesn't! The new 2nd generation Apple 4 GB iPod Mini Silver M9800LL/A is the new benchmark in over-priced electronics that provide music you already own, in a duplicative, unstable, portable format.Apple spared every expense delivering the new sleek design of the Mini Silver. Sure to make you the envy of every kid on the block. And the good news doesn't stop there. Or does it?"
2,iPod sucks,"I just got my iPod mini yesterday. I was in high expectations, but was very dissapointed.The Scroll is SO confusing and hard to work. A simple task like navigating through songs becomes frustrating.Also, their claim for 4 GB holding 1000 songs is wrong. 1000 songs easily becomes about 500 with all the consolation."
4,"iPod Mini--Quality Product, but a couple of issues.","Great product, solid design, excellent size, amazing number of accessories available. Three small complaints: I have 600+ songs on the iPod, but in shuffle mode, it seems to go back to artists/songs too frequently, missing many on the iPod. 2-Earbud headsets stink for running. 3-Battery life could be longer."
1,crap,"do not buy this, absolute crap, had it 6 months, the battery lasts 3 hours at most, and it wont play half of the stuff that is stored on it, plus, it crashes if you skip through two songs. waste of money."
1,DO NOT ORDER FROM WHOLESALERSCLUB!!!!!!,"This is a fabulous product.However, unless you plan on waiting a month to recieve it, DO NOT ORDER IT FROM WHOLESALERS CLUB regardless of the price. I ordered mine on Aug 19th, and I am still waiting for it!!!! Dozens of other people are having the same problem with this item through wholesalers club. BUYER BEWARE!!!!!"
3,Hope it keeps working,Worked fine for a couple of weeks and the hard drive crashed. Apple was prompt to replace it with a new one. I have since read other reviews on other sites. According to other reviews this is a problem with apples ipods. I think it is a great product as far as function and design. I am only reluctant to give it a rating of 5 stars due to it already breaking once. I hope for the price the first malfunction was a fluke. My buddy has the Dell equivilant and has not had any problems.
1,"IPOD Mini Sucks as does Apple ""support""","My wife recently bought me an ipod mini. It would be great if only it worked. The first one died after 3 uses. She had to wait hours at the apple store while they tried to beat a dead horse. They finally agreed it was a lemon and replaced it (after wasting two hours of her time). They strongly suggested it was because I had a PC instead of a MAC.The new one didn't do much better. I ran a fully charged battery for about an hour and it went low. I shut it off and fully charged it. The next day I used it for about an hour, turned it off, and it wouldn't turn on again.Apple makes it as difficult as possible to return these under the warranty.I will never ever ever ever purchase anything from Apple again.P.S. My daughter recently bought an ITrip which broke within days."
2,Too expensive for something that lasts 1 year only,"My husband and I were both SO excited to get our ipod minis last year -- they worked extremely well, very user friendly, sleek...and we loved them for a year. But then BOTH batteries totally gave out (mine before his by about 1 month)...toward the end we were having to charge them every night and now, they don't last more than 20 minutes or so. We had followed all the 'online' advice for not ruining your battery, but, didn't work. Also mine has just completely stopped working --- about a month ago when I tried to turn it on it gave a little 'sick' face (or something like that, the message picture indicator went away pretty quickly). So I thought it needed a software update. I tried updating it on my PC, but, it just did not work whatsoever. Now they are both pretty much going in the trash...all $500 worth."
2,Poor Quality,"I've had my ipod mini for approximately a year and a half. My menu button and volume control have stopped working. I just went to the Apple Store in Oak Brook, IL and apparently the ipod's only have a one year warranty. At the store they confirmed that ""yes your ipod is broken, so you have two choices.""1. ""Since we don't repair them you can purchase a refurbished model for $183.00"" or2. ""We will give you 10% off a new model(new model is $249.00)"".I am not very pleased with Apple and the quality of my now useless, one and a half year old, $250.00 ipod. I chose neither option 1 nor option 2. I refuse to pay more money so that I can once again be sitting in the repair chair at the Apple store in another year and a half. All I ask is that you take into consideration my experience and take to heart that while I was waiting in line for the repair man, there were four people ahead of me with broken ipods and two people behind me. Honestly, my money is spent better elsewhere."
4,My First Ipod,"This is my first experience using a digital, take-it-with-you device, and it has been great! It works perfectly, all the help to figure it out is easily accessible on i-tunes, and I got a great deal with a re-conditioned I-pod Mini. It helps to read the manual(on-line), it saves a lot of time (she said, after wasting much time playing with the buttons)"
2,I am not a kid and itunes disapponts me,"Okay I have had my Ipod mini for over a year now and it has been running just fine. I had about 300 songs on it and everything seemed to be running smooth. Then about a year later my computer got a serious virus on it and had to be reset, not a big problem. About a month later I decided to install Itunes back to my computer. Once installed, a message came up saying in order to get the your songs from your library, you will need to delete them off your ipod and then will be installed to your library. I thought this was a little strange and searched around to find any other options but there wern't any. The only way to do this was to click yes, and i did. Everything from my Ipod was deleted to never be found again. Sure I have some of the Cd's but probably [...] was spent on Itunes merchandise. I am thoroughy disapointed with Apple and all there people you have working there. Thanks Apple, thanks a lot."
2,Boo!!!!!!!!!,Why get an iPod when you could get a Creative Zen 5 GB. You have to send the iPod's battery back in every 1-2 years and pay $100 for it when the Zen has a battery that you can take out and put a new one at home. The Zen costs $199.99. Look it up on amazon and don't buy this.
2,iPod Mini,"Item came with a sticker on the back in the form of a star with the name James in the star. I removed the sticker to find a large, deep scratch underneath. Clever way to disguise the flaw!"
1,iPOD WAS LOADED WITH SONGS i DIDN'T LIKE AND BATTERY IS VIRTUALLY DEAD,"The appearance of the Ipod is very good, however the unit was loaded with songs which it took a while to delete. The major problem, however is that the battery does not hold a charge very well. I did not use this unit until a month after I purchased it, therefore I did not discover the battery problem until after I could return the unit. I feel ripped off. This is the first problem I have had with an Amazon product and I have bought many things from them."
1,Money Back,They didn't send a disc that i could install itunes and they also did not send directions which frustrated me becuase i didn't know how long to charge the ipod. I want my money back.
5,iPOD in Iraq,For my son's 24th birthday I purchased an iPOD for him. He is a Marine and unknown to me he was heading to Iraq for a second tour of duty. When he received his iPOD he plugged it into his computer and downloaded umpteen personally selected music. He tends toward country and rock & roll. He said it was the best sounding music using earphones he has ever heard. Downloads to the iPOD were very simple to perform. The problem was too many tunes to choose from. Now he can take his favorite music with him overseas.
3,did not come with the fallowing:,"This item came with 3 pencil tip size scrapes on the back, Also this item came by itself, meaning no charger, no cord for the computer, and no headphones. Also the battery doesnt fully charge,but it works, just not for long, i ordered it saterday and it came thursday from priority mail, so i thought it was a fast ship."
2,"The iPod's great, the software is terrible","I received the iPod mini as a christmas gift. It's the only mp3 player that I have ever owned. But the Itunes software is terribly annoying. My first beef with it is the size of the program; it is SLOW. It takes 2 to 3 times to bring up as windows media player. It rips a CD at nowhere near the speed of wmp. Also, it destroys any type of organization scheme that you develop on your own. If you rip a CD using Itunes, it will put the files in my documents\my music\itunes\itunes music\artist name\album name. If you have multiple iPod's sharing the same computer, forget trying to keep things straight. Also, apple has added the ""convenience"" of only being able to upload to your iPod using the Itunes software. A drag and drop using windows explorer would be much appreciated.Bottom line: If you've never touched a computer before, apple makes it 100% idiot proof, otherwise the software will frustrate you to no end."
1,Dissapointment,"I bought this product a year ago, and now I can not use it. The battery is shot, and it can't access its own hard drive. I can't get it to re-boot and the people at apple are being useless. I'm buying a creative Zen for many reasons, including its removable battery."
2,Not impressed,"I bought my iPod mini over Christmas in 2004. My headphones broke after just a few months, and right around the one year mark, my iPod stopped working completely. I took it to the Apple store and they gave me a new one, after I bought an extended warranty for $75. I've had my new one for almost a year and for the last month or so, the fully charged battery will not last for even one full song.iTunes is seriously disappointing as well. It is completely incompatible with any other media or mp3 players. Also, any songs downloaded from the iTunes store can only be burned onto a CD 6 times.Apple sucks people in with the iPod's cute appearance and user-friendlyness, but I have not been impressed. I have spent way too much money on accessories (which have also been unreliable and I've replaced chargers, headphones, cases, etc.). I have spent the past 2 years building up a library on iTunes that I will not be able to use with the next mp3 player I buy which will not be an iPod."
3,bad battery,"i charge my ipod for 8-10hrs per night, and yet the battery will not stay charged for long,, i like the ipod mini, but the whole battery situation sucks."
1,What a peice of junk,My son bought this ipod and after 45 days the batt. does not charge anymore. We called Apple and they do not stand behind their products. They said because it was made in June (we bought it in sept.) it was out of the 90 day warranty. We have faxed the papers they have asked and it has been a week; no word on what they are going to do. We have noticed the store we bought it from has pulled all the mini's off of the shelf due to it being junk. Dont waste your money on it nor any other Apple products because they do not stand behind their products.
5,love it!,"I didnt need alot of space for my mp3s. so I got this one. it is very light very fast (compared to nomad creative). So far I didnt have any problems. I am using Iriver transmitter to listen to music in my car, so far so good :)"
1,Crappy sound/no sound/won't stay plugged in,I tried to use this. My good quality headphones would NOT stay plugged in. When you plug in the second set of headphones then the first pair that you plugged in fall out or sound only comes out of one side on each headphones that you plugged in.Look elsewhere for a headphone splitter. DO NOT GET THIS!
5,Fast shipment,The dust jacket was ripped on the back. Book in otherwise great condition. Quick shipment
2,Not what I expected,"Endless footage of panels, switches and people looking tense are not what I anticipated. Some good spots but not near enough detail on the actual blasts and results of the tests."
3,okay beginning book,"Not bad for beginners, covers a great number of horses and has some pretty pictures. Does miss some important information. For example, the paint horse dam or stud must be from registered paints, quarter horses or thoroughbreds. Never even covers the American Bashkir Curly. some of the pictures are very hard to tell the conformation of the particular breed but they are pretty coffee table type pictures. Okay as an introductory but definitely not a definitive breed book."
1,Rohmer: why?,"don't understand the appeal of Rohmer. his films are dry, cold, stiff and didactic. it's like he asked his actors to act like mannequins (English sense). i remember one film where a character takes some money from his pocket to pay for something, without even looking at what he's handing over. and the clerk, similarly, makes change from his drawer without looking at the drawer or the money to see how much change he's giving. trivial? bizarre! and it's all like that."
5,Intelligent and witty,"I agree with Billy Collins, Spencer Short provides the reader with a new voice which is both intelligent and witty. The poems are unquestionably original and disciplined... ...when the last poem has been read, one wishes there were more."
1,Unfair...,"I must agree: this book is uninspired and even in places bordering on plagarism. A startling mistep for the National Poetry Series, which has shown its worst taste this year with a book called Manderley (or something like that) too. Some sense of an ear here in this book, but the ""borrowings"" exhibited in the collection were just too alarming and distracting to bear."
5,Terrific,One of the finest debuts since Tenaya Darlington's Madame Deluxe. These fine young things are like the Britney Spears and Justin Timberlake of the poetry world!
2,Lackluster,"This is by no means near the caliber of book one expects to be winning the National Poetry Series. The poems are edgy, but they lack substance, and many of them seem to need significant editing. It is not surprising that so few of these poems appeared in recognized national literary journals before the publication of the book. Why books like these win national book contests remains a mystery to me. I can see that this book would stand out among a sea of dull manuscripts, but it is hardly good enough to be published in this series and by HarperCollins, no less."
5,Fabulously Exciting,"What an exciting book! It got more and more thrilling as it went along . . . albiet a tragedy of human arrogance. I was mad at Scott as I read . . . Then truly moved at the end. What courage! What strength! The Endurance was the best book of this type yet, but I loved this one, too."
5,A FIRST RATE TRAGEDY INDEED!,"A true story of extraordinary physical endurance and bravery, courage and strength, yet disturbing reading because of the hubris and arrogance of the men involved. This 1911-12 trek to the South Pole was catastrophic, yet meaningful scientifically and oh so poetic! Fascinating!"
4,"Good Book, but take it with a grain of salt","What struck me after reading this, wasn't so much that it was a great book, but that the events surrounding the ""Race to the Pole"" are so intense that even a mediocre book on the subject can be truly rivetting. This was the first book I read on the subject and it left me hungry for more (and less biased) accounts of these times.Even while enjoying the book, it was easy to see the author's skewed point of view towards Admunsen - how she characterizes him as somehow being sneaky or dishonorable simply because he suceeded (on much more limited means) where Scott failed. Her pro-English arrogance shines throughout the book, condenscending to non-Brits if they fail, crying foul if they suceed."
3,"A kinder, gentler view of Scott, but a truer one?","This is a brief, very brisk rehearsal of Scott's fateful (and fatal) trek to the South Pole and partway back. If you are interested in this story and pressed for time this book concisely sets out the facts. It is well written and well organized; it is,however,also controversial because it attempts to refurbish Scott's reputation from the drubbing administered by Roland Huntford in ""The Last Place on Earth."" It is a nice try but it won't wash. Huntford's tome sits atop the tomb of Scott's reputation and is not budged by the light breeze of this sympathetic potrayal. The verdict must stand: Preston kind but false, Huntford mean but true."
5,Fascinating!,"I received this book as a Christmas gift. At first, I was a little disappointed. I had wanted ""Endurance"" by Caroline Alexander. My friend wasn't sure which one to get me, so she ended up giving me ""A First Rate Tragedy."" I finished the book in two days. I could not put it down! Preston does a remarkable job of making the explorers seem like everyday people who just pushed themselves harder than most people would dare. It's amazing how these men nearly made it back in spite of all their amateurism. I eventually did get ""Endurance"", which is also brilliant, especially for the photography. It was interesting reading both sides of the Scott vs Shackleton debate. I highly recommend both."
4,A clear and honest analysis of Robert Scott' s fatal journey,"I previously reviewed this book, and still have the same thoughts. I think Shakelton would have been the one for this journey. Preston brings out the ill prepared journey in graphic and sympathetic terms. I do not, however, quite understand how Scott has reached such a high place in the role of Engligh heros. After all he failed in his attempt, and although courageous it is obvious he was ill suited for this journey. It was another ""Everest"" case, rivalry led to the death of these obviously brave men."
2,Roland Huntford's book is much better,"...because it provides a comparative perspective. It's hard to see why people like Preston continue apologizing for Scott, an arrogant, clueless man who was out for his own glory and cared little about the safety of his party, scientific results, or any kind of real thinking about how to do things appropriately and get home afterwards. Huntford's biography points out why Scott died on this trip: because he let his ignorance cloud his judgment and shut out information from people who could have helped him. It's really annoying that people still go on glorifying Scott--who didn't make it home and caused the deaths of others who accompanied him."
2,Lightweight Treatment of a Heavyweight Subject,"I have recently discovered the ""doomed adventure"" genre, and would have enjoyed this book were it the only one of the genre I read. I felt that the author skimmed over too much detail that, for me, makes these tales so compelling. For instance, how did they cook their food at such high altitude and low temperatures? What did the men back at base camp do all day? Why did Scott insist that one of his colleagues abandon his skis in favor of marching through deep snow and a crevasse-strewn landscape?I realize that she was working with diaries, and was hampered by the fact that the pole party did not survive. Still, some ""nuts and bolts"" of the daily processes and challenges faced would have been much more satisfying to me, and perhaps would have shown more in-depth research of this fascinating subject of early polar exploration."
4,An engaging book for the Antarctic novice,"This is a well-told and balanced account of the Scott expedition for those who do not have much background on the ""Heroic Age"" of Antarctic exploration. Although it lacks the detail of works such as Huntford's, it makes up for its brevity with understanding and compassion for those brave and foolish men of the early 1900's. I still do not understand how Scott could have been so clueless in so many respects to his expedition planning, but I came away with a greater understanding of what drove and motivated that complex man."
2,bored board,"This board works great, but the processor that I paid big bucksfor wouldn't work in this board. Tried everything includingupgrading the bios."
5,Wonderful,"I first discovered this book at a friend's house, and it's a must-have for any vegetarian or vegetable-lover. The recipes are wonderful, and there are so many different cooking styles to be found. It's my go-to cookbook."
1,"If I could give it less than a 1, I would!","I had bought these for my daughter. They arrived broken and I sent them back. THANK HEAVENS! They were huge, gaudy, and extremely cheap looking. Note to self, do not trust jewelry online! These were truly horrible. The picture is cute and, if they had looked like the picture, I would have been happy. The colors were not true, they looked like costume jewelry from a gumball machine not the quality I expected at all."
3,Pretty (But One Of The Stones Fell Out),"I bought these when they were on sale for $9.99. The craftsmanship of the silver is okay, but nothing extravagant. The amethyst are a nice size; and the mother of pearl is pretty. However, I'm not sure if I would have bought them at the regular price.EDIT: Other than trying them on when I first received them, I never wore them for an extended period. Good thing, because just being stored in a jewelry pouch resulted in the Amethyst of one falling out. Not good craftsmanship if you ask me! I'd skip these if they ever are for sale again."
5,excellent results,This product arrived in a very timely manner. It dissolves easily and does not have a strong flavor. This is a real bonus since my sister in undergoing chemo and her taste buds REALLY do not like a lot of the protein products we've tried. This product disappears easily into other food or juices without leaving an aftertaste. We're ordering more.
5,Keep coming back,I use these on both my basses. I have tried other brands and types but I keep returning to these. I won't use anything else.
2,Less Than a Ghost,"While there's no denying that the author is a gifted writer (in the sense of her verbal dexterity), the plot was too thin and frankly incomprehensible. How did Simon acquire his powers of animism? How did Cameron, the lighthousekeeper go unhinged in the way that he did? How did that little girl get there? Where is everybody going? Which one's real? Which one isn't? The lines between ghosts and human and dream figures was too blurry for me to enjoy.The book's too short! (And maybe 15 pages were devoted to beautiful but baffling diary entries.) Only Simon, the farmer magician was developed as a character. I didn't think I had picked up a blood-curdling horror novel. But I expected a ghost story to give me, at the very least, a few shivers of uneasiness.As it is, it just makes good copy for a travel guide for Scottish lighthouses."
2,Too thin,"It is just too thin. U do not realize that - until u get it. If u want something small , this is good."
4,These made a nice gift,These were very nice and the only reason I wouldn't give them 5 stars was because the stones were smaller than the picture made me feel they were.
4,Great gloves!,"These gloves worked great with my black dress I wore in my friend's wedding. I like how they can go just below the elbow or over the elbow. They did't stay in place as well as I would've liked, but they worked. Got lots of compliments. And it was fun have the fingerless gloves - different than the norm and great for a summer wedding."
4,Captivating and instructive,"This is a captivating movie offering some insight in the Taliban-ruled Afghan society and containing fascinating views on the Afghan landscape. The hero who tries to abduct his love from a sinister place is certainly an old literary pattern, but it still works."
3,Interesting learning experience for an author,"I read the book as a potential writer, trying to learn what makes a classic. I still don't know. The author was seemingly open about sexual matters, only to discover in his later writings in the trilogy that he left out some very important sexual experiences in the first book. On the other hand, his style seemed to me to be obscure and inconsistantat times, as if his writing voice was not jet set. Looking back on the experience, I'm not sure what I have taken away from having read it. At the age of 75 years, I finally learned what ""corn hole"" means, so I guess all was not lost."
5,So beautiful and so important,"We have been partners/lovers for 14 years, and we found this book to be so important for young gay men everywhere. It was our story. White's new autobiography is also seminal reading. Thank you, Edmund!"
3,A Boy's Somewhat Tedious Story,"Yeah, I'm aware of all of the comparisons to J. D. Salinger and Oscar Wilde but this book doesn't get me to put author Edmund White in those leagues. Sure, the writing is high-falutin' - ""ectoplasmic"", ""extravagant mendicancy"", ""colloidal"" - but that doesn't necessarily make for a better story. One creative approach is that the narrator is never named. Whoever he is is a deeply disturbed individual who, at fifteen, seems to have more baggage than a fully-loaded 747. The scenes with the shrink he finally turns to are among the most unsatisfying in the 218 pages. Here's the central issue: instead of moving along the story, White meanders into long, long, confusing, boring soloquies citing obscure literary references (see above). For someone so talented, perhaps he could write a less esoterical and more interesting book."
5,A Boy's Own Story,"For me this is one of the best books describing the experience of gay adolescence in the 50's and early 60's. I wonder if the people who dislike this book have personal experience dating from that era. I only wish that there had been a book like this for me to read when I was growing up during that time. The book rings entirely true to one person's character and growth, warts and all."
2,not so much,"I didn't really like this one. In a way its worth reading as a coming out story and the writing was good enough to keep me reading. But the story...not so much. I found alot of the stuff that happened wierd at best and ridiculous at worst. And the end {bites}. I mean I got to the end and was like...um...ok...? I can't say I regretted reading it but at the same time its not something I need to remember. It jumps around alot, and it lacks valid plot points as far as I'm concerned. But I think its the kind of book you need to make up your own mind about."
1,Overrated and disappointing,"Not only is the ending a tribute to absolute betrayal, but the entire book goes in circles without ever getting anywhere.Graphic description of feeling, sights,sounds, etc. is wonderful but when it is overused as much as it is in this 'story' it becomes extremely tedious. The entire book is almost one long string of tiring metaphores.The main character starts out confused and ends up hopelessly lost. It is obvious that the main character doesn't have a clue what he really likes or is attracted to. Utter confusion of this magnitude is a very poor way to convey a point.This work is a tragic insult to the entire gay culture."
1,disappointing,"When i stumbled upon this book in the library, i decided that it looked interesting enough to read. As soon as i got home, i read it all the way through, and was not impressed in the least. As i look at everyone elses reviews, i am confounded as to how this book has garnered so much praise. i have no idea why this is considered a classic, or why it is published by Modern Library. It doesn't deserve it. If you want a good book about homosexuality, read Giovanni's room by James Baldwin. Don't waste your time, as I did, on a book that fails even to elevate itself above bad soft-core porn."
5,"""so many useless bodies""","The first track, ""Fluorescent Grey"", appears to a fantasy describing a dream about a mysterious dead boy the singer was obsessed with in his youth. (Something about the song gives me the impression that the boy committed suicide.) ""You were my god. ...He will never know"". The 30-second clip on amazon was taken from the song's introduction. (To my ears, the full song sounds more like ""Spring Hall Convert"".) You will have to pay $0.99 to hear what the song really sounds like.It was probably a mistake for the band to shunt these songs off onto an EP. This album is more accessible thanCryptograms. These songs are some of the band's best so far."
3,Suprised by religious focus,I was very disappointed to learn that the book had such a religious focus. I didn't feel that I got that information from what I read. Your buyers should be aware of this. I bought the book for my niece and she was turned off by this. I regret buying the book for her.
1,not a musican,"The cd was lost an they sent another one, they were awesome in sending another one...although a talented actor, music is not his forte."
1,Very Dissapointed,"I've been using this product for months now and have found it to be extremely helpful in my quest to gain muscle and loose fat. I've bought this product locally and never had a problem with getting an expired product. However, my local Bally's sells their powder quickly and has trouble keeping it in stock. So I ordered it from here, and they sent me a ragged box that expired on August of 2005. Whether the powder is good or not doesn't matter, I shouldn't pay 40 bucks for something that is expired. Not cool... Buy it locally, not here."
5,"Gosh.....Can This Album Get Any More ""80's"" ?","i just got my copy of this album....kudos to Isaac for puttin' it down...the synths,.totally 80's. ""Showdown"" is the jam! really diggin' it. ""Love Attack"" is cool too. if you're a Isaac Hayes collector you got to get this one. :)"
4,Earns points in my book for trying.,"While by no means among Isaac's most ambitious or memorable albums, ""Love Attack"" does have its moments. His cover version of Major Harris' 1975 hit ""Love Won't Let Me Wait"" is a great throwback to his early-'70s Stax works--and earns points just for trying. His remake of Billy Joel's ""She's Got A Way"" is respectable if innovative while ""Eye Of The Storm"" and ""Let Me Be Your Everything"" vare quite intersting. The other tracks, unfortunately, are veasily forgettable. All in all, ""Love Attack"" has its strengths and moments but sounds dated to some extent."
3,Excellent Electric Bass Playing,"The first and last tracks on this album are worth the price of admission. Wicked funky bass playing. These two tracks really show off the strengths of the electric bass.If you are an electric bass player, this album will keep you busy for a while, listening to Mr. Clarke's excellent work. His range of tone qualities and techniques are amply exhibited here. This is a showcase for Stanley Clarke's virtuosity, and really an encyclopedia of the state of electric bass technique at the end of the 20th century.That being said, many of Clarke's tunes lie flat. They lack direction and fail to hold the listener's interest(at least this listener's interest). Charles Mingus he is not. Stanley Clarke's genius is in the expressiveness and technique of his playing."
4,If this review could talk.,"If only this bass could talk displays Stanley Clarke's amazing bass playing talent. In the opening track he primarily uses a 12 bar blues tapping line with a chorus effect that is just astonishing. Along with the help of tap dancer Gregory Hines, the duo fulfill the track with a percussive sound that is rarely heard. We hear a similar sound on track 9 on this album. The duo is a great combination, it's almost a shame that more of this album wasn't just the two of them jamming it out."
4,If This Bass Could Only Talk,I enjoyed it. Play it in the background and it'll turn into your best friend. :)
1,Disappointed with these,These were smaller and thinner than we expected. We were quite disappointed. Would have never purchased these if we had seen them first. Do not recommend these.
3,I'm not disappointed with these grapefruit spoons,"Since Oneida has a reputation to maintain, I took a chance, placed my order, and am not disappointed. For the price, they do the job. If I was expecting them to rival my silver pattern or even my extra-heavy stainless flatware, I would have been disappointed. Since all I was looking for was an attractive, servicable spoon at a low price to take the hassle out of eating half a grapefruit, they do just fine."
4,"Not bad, but need better docs and QA...","Cord does what it should, and it's constructed well. Couple (minor) problems:1. Supposed to come with two locking rings-- one threaded, one Marinco quick-lock. Mine had two threaded rings.Also, there no instructions on how exactly one is supposed to swap out the rings.2. The documentation on the box does not describe how the cord is wired. Going from a 3-conductor 120v plug (hot-neural-ground) toa 4-conductor 240V plug (hot-hot-neutral-ground) could be done a couple ways. I was pleasantly surprised to findthe hot lead on the 120V plug was wired to both hot leads on the 240V plug (that way, any 120V appliances in the trailer/RV willhave power, no matter which ""leg"" they are tied to)."
1,Amazingly irritating book [Has SPOILERS],"I couldn't read this book through. I read through some of it, then just skipped around to find out what happened. Some of my pet peeves were that:1. It's interesting that it's ok for her mother's loved man to try and kill her but it's not so ok for her to kill him in self-defense.2. The usual, power goes to head of young person who is not equipped to deal with massive amounts of power, plot is truly a pain.3. The, ""let's strip the main character of everything she loves in life"" plot device gets tired, FAST.4. Jenna is just irritating...period.5. Jenna's mom is amazingly self-centered, kind of brings a bad name to mothers in general.6. Book doesn't seem to have much going on except for lots of betrayal and gore.I'd say, save your money. Except that a large number of people seem to go in for this type of stuff."
4,Gets the job done,"Honestly, I don't know that I should have purchased this... I found that I was much less prone to cutting myself if I was wearing a full leather glove on my non-carving hand. So, this doesn't really get much use anymore. Fortunately it was pretty cheap so no real loss. It gets the job done though if you don't want to cut your thumb."
4,Will not carve without it.,"Very well pleased with the thumb guard. The only problem I've encountered is that it has a tendency to shift positions and leave my thumb exposed to the carving knife. However, I have learned to watch its position and have not had an accident since I've started wearing the thumb guard. Sure beats the Duct Tape version I made for myself before receiving this one."
3,finger guards,these guards have a tendency to move around on my fingers. this could be of my way of carving. thank you
3,Finger and thumb guard for Carving,"The concept is good, but the stitching came out on the finger, so I had to open the sewing machine and re-sew it. It works ok now."
1,nothing like in the picture,"They are lousy stuff and i regret buying them. Very loose and fall easy, non functional. I do not advise buying those."
5,Excellent Cook Book,"I bought this cook book when I was a young bride in 1958 (I have a first edition/first printing) and I used it throughout my marriage, and after my husband passed-over . . . I love the recipes that are easy to follow and use. Charles Harper'S illustrations throughout the book are fun and make the book fun to use. This cookbook should be in everyone's kitchen. B Best"
1,Betty Crocker Dinner for Two,"This was the older, and original version of the Betty Crocker Dinner for Two I received as a wedding gift in 1968. I was not able to determine the smaller size or lack of color illustrations from the information on the web site. The seller refused to accept a prompt return and subsequent exchange for the version I thought I was ordering."
2,More worn-out than was advertised,The corners and binding of the cover were worn extensively and the book pages were yellowed. Those things were not mentioned in the description.
4,Good but confusing,"This is the 3rd book in the Pauline Sokol series.It is a cute, funny series and the 1st 2 books were very delightful.This book has way too many characters and it is sometimes confusing who is who.Jaggar is in this book more and he and Pauline finally kiss.But, the mystery of Jaggar is getting old.The 4th installment needs to shed some light on Jaggar or risk loosing its edge.Also,all the cross-dressing/gay thing is way over the top.The author must live in a large gay population.You just don't see that many gay/cross-dressers in most cities.Also,if Goldie is so gay how did he make it in army intelligence? Don't think so."
4,Capsize 7 rocks!!!!!!,"This EP is a short collection of songs similar to and including songs from the band's one fantastic release, Mephisto. Having seen these guys live in Chapel Hill, NC I was blown away by their performance at the Cat's Cradle. Their heavy guitars, drums and quality vocals sound like a sound track to a violent Japanamation film; dark and subdued but very energetic.Catch 'em live if they are still around."
1,Do not order this item from Tech Depot!,"I can't truly review the produce, because I never received it, but if you are ordering it from Tech Depot, remove it from your cart. They didn't send me the right item, and it's been a 6 week battle trying to get my money back. Think it won't happen to you, then proceed. Buyer beware!"
4,Everything Men [don't] Know...,"Very funny :).I don't think this ""book"" is so deep as to try and convey hatred or other negative feelings. It is a joke, and from what I can tell of the reactions I witnessed when showing it around, it is funny to both sexes.As for it being a waste of valuable resources...it can be used for notes. In which case, ""What Men Know"" will be a bunch of blabber that you jotted down :)."
2,Remake,"This is a remake of the John Carpenter film of the same name. Here Carpenter is the producer. That film just misses being a classic. 100 years ago a ship was purposely sunk, drowning all aboard. Now they're back for revenge. They seek out the descendants of those responsible for their deaths. Overall I was satisified with the original, but not this remake."
1,insult to the origional,"this takes the origional titles the Fog and spits all over it. Doesen't have anything to do with the cool errie story of the origional, and ends with a totally stupid pointless idea.....crapiest remake ever made...hell this is almost a romantic comedy...yes it's that bad."
3,Clark Kent and Shannon from Lost vs. The Ghosts,"The good: It was almost EXACTLY the same as the original movie.The bad: It was ALMOST exactly the same as the original movie.The ugly: I kept screaming at Clark Kent to USE HIS HEAT VISION TO DISSIPATE THE FOG!!!!!! And I could not understand why he kept driving a truck when he's faster than a speeding bullet.All jokes aside, I really did feel like I was watching a crossover of Smallville and Lost taking place on the set of Pirates of The Caribbean.3 out of 5 stars because it was enjoyable and had an attractive cast that was fun to goof on. 2 stars taken off because the story and actual film was too close to the original story and the acting was not the best. I tend to want remakes to take us into new territory with the update like House on Haunted Hill, and 13 Ghosts."
5,Lovely!,We used this as part of our wedding ceremony and gave the books as gifts to the wedding party. Just perfect!
1,terribly stereotyped,"I had hoped this would be a charming little gift for my sweetie, but I read it with disbelief. Are you in a heterosexual relationship where the fierce male likes things and the lovely female likes shopping? Was the male in a cage of ice until the free spirited female came along and melted it? If so, this book will probably make you smile. For me though, it felt completely irrelevant to my life and I can't imagine giving it to my husband. I can't really imagine giving it to anyone I know who's under 60. Too bad, it looked adorable and I really wanted to fall in love with this author who seems to have so many fans."
3,dinosaur love story,the book is okay but it is not really a young children's book even though the size. illustrations and text would make you think it was
3,"Easy to install and use, sounds great...","My only issue is that some files won't play, at random. Reloading the same file generally corrects the problem, but you never know when you're going to run across a ""corrupted"" song. I understand that even iPods suffer from the same issue occasionally. Also, skip the tedious Media Player sync process and just drag and drop the files right onto the unit. Much easier. UPDATE: a firmware update obtained at iRiver's website corrected my ""corrupted"" file issue. The unit now plays every file every time. I'd give it five stars now."
5,"I thought the iRiver T10 was great, this is amazing!!","Wow, this mp3 player is amazing!! If you managed to get one during the christmas deal at Best Buy like me, you got a great deal! They gave you a 50$ gift card to Best Buy for buying it. It only costs 80$, and is a 512 MB mp3 player! It may not have FM radio function, but you bought this for mp3's not radio. You use Windows Media Player 10 to manage this. It has great design and it looks awesome! If you want an inexpensive mp3 player, that is great, and gives you a coupon for a month of free downloads at Napster To-Go, then you have to buy this one. Forget the iRiver T10, this is great!"
2,Careful!,"I bought this as a Christmas present. Be careful, it absolutely will NOT work with Windows 2000, or ME. No patches or fixes available. Any company that omits half of the operating sytems in the country from using their product must not hire the best nor brightest."
2,I agree.,"I agree completely with the person below. I got this MP3 player for Christmas, and I cannot download any songs onto it, because I don't have a Windows XP. I think it's actually a pathetic way to earn money. To get Windows XP software, it would be an extra $100. There is no way around this obstacle. However, I did burn a few songs off of a CD at a friends house, and the 2 songs I have play well. The quality is really good."
1,Warning - Requires WindowsXP!,"You need Windows XP and, more specifically, Windows Media Player 10 to make this player work. If you don't use XP, and I don't, go find another player.I filed a complaint with iRiver and the person who answered it was arrogant and combative. I own older iRiver products but my two new T-series players are going back. With as many choices as there are out there, you can bet I won't be buying another iRiver."
1,*** Don't buy this MP3 player **********,I brought this three hours ago. I had very hard time to install it on WindowXP. The support of either Iriver.com is terrible. Don't buy this product.
3,Doesn't work with Macs and Linux,"I got this gadget as a gift and been using it for couple of month now. It works well, very light, and has a long battery life. There is only one problem - it only works with Windows XP and Windows Media Player 10. iRiver doesn't make drivers for Windows 2000, OS X, or Linux. So unless you have XP, I suggest you stay away from it."
4,great little device,"i purchased this device about 6 months ago for one thing: recording. you can plug any music source into the jack and record for up to 3 hours at 320k. i dabble in DJing and i can take an RCA to Stereo mini Y-plug directly from the mixer into the T30, bypass the computer, bypass any other interference and it sounds great. Once the recording is finished, plug in the USB and use the explorer to drag-n-drop the files onto the computer. i can also delte files from the player using explorer. nothing could be easier.the only problem i have is that it sucks the life out of batteries very quickly. i highly recommend rechargeables.as for the other stuff, i wouldnt use it as my regular MP3 player because it is very small, the buttons are not that intuitive, and 512 MB is really nothing to get excited about. spend a few more dollars and get more storage."
4,A really nice player for the price!,"I got this little player several months ago and was a little worried about a few of the reviews I read here. While its true it eats batteries like crazy and doesn't hold as much music as stated, it still holds quite a bit! and the convienience of having so much music easily at hand in such a small package (for me anyway) makes up for the batteries I have to keep around.The sound is really good for the price, and I didn't have any problems figuring out how it worked or in reading the player's screen. All in all it is definately well worth the price."
5,Adorable but basic little player,"I just purchased this player because the Centon that I got for Christmas turned out to be a disappointment. But this player is light, easy to download, has good sound quality, and understandable controls.If you want a basic MP3 player and don't need more than about 120 songs, this one is for you. I used it to get some songs off a music website, and the rest were my favorite songs transferred from my extensive CD colletion to the player. This makes workouts a lot more fun with only my favorite songs playing.If, however, you want more extensive memory and do a lot recording, it would be best for you to keep looking."
3,difficult to load,"I like convience of an electric grinder and the rechargable aspect but this one has two drawbacks.First, it is very difficult to load the peppercorns, it must be done two or three corns at a time, and the receptical holds only about 3 or 4 tablespoons of corns. The second drawback is that the plastic holder the the grinder sits on is so lightweight that it lifts up with the grinder so one has to use two hands one to hold down the holder, one to pick up the grinder. It does grind very well."
4,Star Frit Electric Pepper Grinder,"This is the 3rd one I have owned and am very happy with it, 1st one I bought 8 yrs ago for $5.00 in a marked down sale bin. Second one cost me $19.00, this one $29.00. talk about inflation!"
4,Great pepper grinder...but,"I love this pepper grinder! It's very strong and is re-chargable. The only problem is that when you have to refill the peppercorn balls, there is a very small area to put them in, making it quite difficult. I wish there was an easier way to refill it!"
1,do not recomend,not good quality . the plastic jar have got cracks along the side all the way up only from a few times of use. and after several months started to leak.The plastic jar is made from cheap material and i do not recomend to anyone
4,Reasonably Priced & Good Quality,First and foremost the price was excellent. Also I needed the ice crushing capabilities and the ability to make smoothies.
1,Not very clear on results,My experience with these was mixed they are cheap but you get what you pay for. Wasn't sure on how to interpret some of the results. So probably would not get these again.
4,As good as brand name...,"Loved the product, Using the Ovulation predictor strips, I became pregnant on the first try!"
2,birds didn't like it,"My birds sleep purched at the top of their swings, they did not like this swing because the wire is too thin for them, they prefer their plastic swing to this one."
4,great veterinary student resource!,Wonderful pictures with explanations put in simple language that is easy to understand.
5,adding to our set,Nice we need to add to our set of flatware and it was nice to find these the price was right and the process was easy
3,Nice set,I bought this set to use as everyday but found the tines of the forks were too thick to pick up small pieces of food (I have tendinitis). I gave the set to my sister who had the same set and liked it. Now she has service for 16 and is pleased. I went back to my old set which I had set aside when I bought this set. I am more careful now when shopping for flatware. I want to see it before I buy it.
4,"good, but forks too small","i bought this set about a year ago, i still have it and they still look great and i still use them. However, i felt that the dinner forks were slightly smaller than what i was used to.. other than that i have no complaints- love the design and get compliments on the set alot."
3,Too Heavy,I find that the knives are very heavy compared to my original set purchased from Kohls. I have not been satisfied with the knives.
2,Flimsy,"I've owned this flatware for four years and have not been happy with the quality. All but the knives are thin guage metal. In fact, I've had to tell my children not to use the spoons for hard ice cream cups because they were bending. The surface has held up OK, with the exception of some minor marks from dishwasher detergents. I expected a better product from Oneida."
1,Not the same as what you get from the Onieda company!!!!!,"I had this set already and was ordering an additional set to add too it. The knives are thinner and all the items had a big fat made in china stamped on it. I was very disappointed with it. They don't feel like as good of quality as my original set direct from Oneida. I would recommend ordering direct from the company because if you order here, you are not getting the same quality. I'm sure nobody else would notice the difference but me, however, it is really upsetting to know I could have gotten flatware that matched exactly what I already owned."
5,"buy this one for yourself and a single, aging friend","15 or 20 years ago - more or less - Valerie Taylor wrote a pretty good book about aging women falling in love. Although I don't pretend to have read every book in the lesbian bibliography, I haven't seen another book that was about women in their sixties falling in love with each other until now - and Mulligan is a good one. MacGregor is an excellent writer. Her books are filled with believable characters and in general her plots are realistic.I found that I really liked Louise and Marty a lot and hoped they could get past the stumbling blocks they created for themselves. I understood each woman's reticence and eagerness about their growing relationship. This is a book about women who have friends and co-workers who come across a real people. I particularly liked the easy, loving banter between Marty and her daughter. Give this one to an aging woman who is reluctant to look for love and companionship."
2,Good for a religious book,"""For Christmas and bows,""Winter coats and a sled,""To say, 'I love you,'""God made red.""Each of the seven colors in this book (white, pink, yellow, blue, green, orange, red, in that order), a Thomas Kinkade painting with the color featured prominantly and a verse similar to the one above is presented. Each verse ends in, ""God made...""If you are looking for a book with religious overtones to introduce colors, this one is charming."
5,A wonderful CD,"I have this CD and simply love it. The music is enegetic and fun. The dynamics and tempo change a lot even within a song, very expressive. Something will start out slow and mournful gradually speeding up to a frenzied pace. Im amazed at the musicians abilities. I love it so much I took the trouble to look up the lyrics of my favorite (track# 2) so I could sing along in Russian! I finally found them at [a website] Next I plan to find sheet music to track# 3 that I can play on my cello!All in all it is a great selection of Russian folk music, I listen to it all the time."
2,Mediocre thriller won't keep you guessing unless you're an idiot,"After watching Columbus Circle I have to say I suspect that the early good reviews posted on this site might be from people who are involved with the film. Story about an agoraphobic young woman (Selma Blair) whose elderly neighbor is killed is one of those twisty thrillers where all the twists are ridiculously predictable--I figured out everything that was going on in this movie about 10 minutes in. There are some good performances by Selma Blair, Giovoni Ribisi and Kevin Pollack that keep the movie watchable, and there are a few amusing lines, probably courtesy of co-writer Pollack but as a thriller this thing is a complete dud--it's too slow and too predicable and it generates absolutely no suspense."
2,Buyer Beware,"First of all, this product does work as promised and does in quickly and thoroughly. However, before buying this product read the label carefully, and do a little background check on one of the active ingredients - dicamba. Because of its noxious nature, its potential comtamination of groundwater, and the difficulty of disposing of unused product, I can't recommed this product."
1,Just not worth it,"Though the price is right, I didn't like the final results. I tried putting this on my Zune at least a dozen times and couldn't keep from getting dust, a fingerprint or something under it. I also couldn't get it to slide all the bubbles out. I finally went and ordered an invisibleSHIELD and though it was considerably more in price, the ease of putting it on (flawless the 1st time) was worth the extra money."
1,NOT MADE FOR ZUNE,"The plastic is good quality and repels good enough, however, it is not even close to the screen size. It covers around 90% of it, but 90% isn't good enough with things like this, it defeats the purpose. I didn't even use it for my zune as it was far too small and would have looked absurd, instead, I put it on a camera that I had.Bottom line: This product does not cover the entire zune screen."
1,screen protector,Did not go on easy still has air bubbles. Had to use the 2 that was in the package .
3,screen protector,This comes with little tabs to help you separate the film from the backing. One of the tabs is right on the top surface of the film and it was hard to get the sticky residue off. A little persistence paid off and the film is doing its job.
2,Just ok...,It say it cannot be scratched but sure enough...I have 2 scratches in the film and I only had it for 2 weeks...when dust gets under it it does not stick as well and now I have dust and bubbles under the film...I bought another brand to try a different one...
4,beautifully photographed book,"Looking for ideas to inspire building a Tuscan farmhouse, then this is it. It does lack in exterior shots, but the interior shots are wonderful. Whether you use this for inspiration or not, it will add to anyone's collection."
4,"Good ventilation, but cold!","This is a fine tent. If used by only two people, it is very roomy.It has an excellent ventilation thanks to all the mesh on the walls and doors. This makes it a pleasure to sleep in on warm summer nights.However, calling it a 3-season tent is a bit of a stretch. I slept in it in September in Yellowstone (elev. 7500ft/2300m), when the temperature outside was going down to 40F/+4C, and inside it would be just as cold! That's a side effect of that good ventilation, of thin materials used, and of the fact that the fly is too short to touch the ground. The tent simply won't hold inside any heat that your bodies generate. So, if you plan to use it outside of the warm summer season, make sure you have good sleeping bags."
5,Classic Thomas!,"With twenty episodes plus bonus content, this is a great DVD for any Thomas fan. My boys love watching it and playing with their train table, even though they have seen some of the episodes before. I like hearing the voices of George Carlin and Alec Baldwin, which always make me laugh!"
1,Not by original artists,"This is a rip-off CD. Elevator music masquerading as original recordings. Although it lists the original artists and sounds like a bargain, the back of the CD contains this note: ""All Songs Performed by The Geoffery Charles Orchestra"". The arrangements are similar to but not the same as or as good as the originals, and of course they are not the original recordings at all. After a while you get really tired of the sameness of the arrangements."
2,BEWARE OF THIS 2-CD SET - NOT ORIGINAL ARTISTS !,"I think that there may be two CDs with the same title : "" Instrumental Legends "". Certainly the one which I purchased has no original artists , all the tracks being performed rather stiffly by "" The Geoffrey Charles Orchestra "". I am very disappointed , but I couldn't be bothered to return the CDs. When I looked at the Amazon website , I was aware that there was some confusion , with various reviews contradicting each other and confounding the issue. I am sorry that I didn't pursue the matter ; as they say , "" Caveat Emptor "" !"
2,One good selection in a bag of boring dross,"I bought this CD because of one selection, ""Moonglow/Theme From Picnic,"" by Morris Stoloff, from the soundtrack of the movie ""Picnic."" This has been one of my favorite recordings since it was released in the 1950s, and I was glad to finally have it on a CD. In my opinion, it's a brilliant arrangement.Unfortunately, I cannot say that about any of the other selections in the release. I had forgotten how bad this stuff was. If I ever put it in my DVD player again, it will be to listen to that one track. Enough said."
2,Neil stop screaming.,"I was at the series of shows from 1986 where this album was made. I couldn't wait for it to come out. Part of the problem is false advertising. While most of this was recorded at the Greek Theatre in 1986, some of it was from the Mountain View Music Theatre in northern California.I give it two stars only because it does capture the feel of a Diamond concert just a bit. Still, other than, I am I Said, Cherry Cherry, and Hello Again, the songs are simply butchered. To make it worse, the album is poorly mixed.If you want later Diamond live material, checi out ""Greatest Hits 1966-1992, or Stages. Avoid ""Live From America"" like the plague."
1,One Of His Finest Efforts Ever!,This is one of those times where CD clarity is more of a curse than a blessing.
2,Cant Touch The Original - 2 stars for 2 songs,"If you can pick this CD up for cheap it's worth it for 2 songs - Back in L.A. and I Dreamed a Dream, the rest of the album is below average and Neil shouts many of the lyrics. This album signals the start of Neil's decline and unfortuneately his voice has now completely abandoned him."
2,Changing times,"Hot August Night II is the start of the decline of the crooner and the beginer of the talker/screamer in Neil Diamond. Sometime in the late 80's he stopped singing most of his songs and started to talk or yell the most important lyrics. It was like he last all tone and rythm. I grew up being rocked to sleep as a young child to the original Hot August Night, but this album still gives me nightmares. Every couple of years I put in in the CD player just to give it another try and it always goes back on the shelf, replaced by the original. This album includes his great late 70's/early 80's songs, but they are butchered, much like his other classics. Having seen him in concert no less than 10 times, each live show is so different, sometimes smooth and classy, other times like this album indifferent, out of tune and careless. It just give rise to the question did the age, number of live shows catch up with him in the 80's?"
1,Save your money,"I can't believe thet released this cd.He is often shouting not singing,at times off key.Buy the original Hot August night.This is bad."
1,Hot August Night 2,This CD has almost every one of his greatest big sounds. My concern is that he shouts many of the lyrics instead of singing to the live Los Angeles audience. I found it makes listening to the CD disappointing because the listener has to endure yelling instead of singing.
3,Great Rock And Roll,"This is some great rock and roll. Half the songs are rock ballads and the other half, uptempo oldie songs that I like. My favorite song on this album has to be Back In L.A. It is a great song. Buy this album."
1,"I love you Neil, But...","this was awful. The acoustics were terrible, the band was below average and Neil Diamond ended up screaming most of the words to his songs. Even a haunting, beautiful melody like ""Love on the Rocks"" was tortured by Diamond and the band. It seemed like this was an excuse to have a sequel to ""Hot August Night"" (which was superb), but it fell flat. If you are a Neil Diamond fan you will be disappointed. I know I was."
5,lynch hung,"this cd is very good. lynch is the best rapper out there in the underground and any where else. this cd is the best he has along with season of da siccness. i reccomend it for its tight beats and awsome lyrics. also look into x raided, mr. doctor, sicx, and c.o.s. who are good artists. pick up lynch's new album suicide note that is also a good cd"
5,Motivational read!,"Great book, great read. It should be read by teachers, coaches, leaders of any type who are looking for ways to improve themselves and there students."
4,KidLead recommends this book,"These are great authors and any book that focuses on kids being seen and developed as leaders is a great recommend from KidLead, America's only leadership development training program for 10-13 year olds (www.kidlead.com).Alan Nelson, Ed.D."
1,I'll make this short but brief.,"1) There is no Irish Pagan tradition called Witta--at least to the best of my knowledge as an Irish Pagan commonly living in Ireland and being a scholar of Irish history.2) Even if the tradition did exist, it most certainly would not be called Witta in the mother tongue. Why? Because the opening W is unpronounceable, that's why!3) This whole book is just a knock off of all the Wicca 101 books out there trying to pass itself off as something unique.4) Llewellyn gives me the shudders. Do they not have editors? Do they not have standards?5) For tha real scoop on Irish Witchcraft, try looking up and contacting any one of the many Irish covens on the Web."
1,"Witta? Not worth even half a star, but the system requires 1","""Witta"", Edain McCoy's venture into the world of Irish Witchcraft, fails miserably from the start. The most glaring example being that there is no ""W"" in Irish Gaelic.Llewellyn would have been better served by presenting yet another of their fluff-bunny feel good Silver Ravenwolf novels."
1,Uh-uh. Don't bother.,"Not fond of this one, to be completely honest. The Irish information was remotely interesting to read through, but all it looks like is a Wicca-repackaged-replaced-with-t's book with an Irish flavor. It was so disappointing that a bug crawling on the wall next to me was more interesting than paying genuine attention to the book. I dutifully read through it since I got it as a gift and kept waiting for -one sentence- to jump at me saying 'Hey, this is worth my time!'.If you're really interested in Irish culture and bringing it into your craft, you'd be better off studying mythology, history and other books, not this thing.My fault for reading it all the way through. Wish I could give it some glowing tidbit of praise to make it worth one's time, but... nope, sorry, can't do it."
1,Yet another misconception,"First we start with the word Witta. Someone should have told her at Llewellyn that Witta is not Irish but Scottish. And that the word itself means Elder. Witta was someone you went to in the village council who had all the answers. The word was later mispronounced and gave birth in the 1930's to the modern day philosophy of Wicca (Thanks to Scotman Gerald Gardner).Wicca writers, especially those simply pumping out titles, should stay away...far away from the celtic religions. It seems that everytime one doesn't, the rest of us hold our heads in our hands and proceed to whimper. This book particularly hurts my intelligence."
1,Skip it.,This book has been panned throughout the pagan community; it is more a collection of wishful thinking than historical fact
1,Pagan poppycock,"I purchased this book because I had a gift certificate & it was one of the few Pagan titles they had. Oops! Big mistake! One of the first things I noticed was Irish myth touted as fact. Second, there are MANY sentences, and entire paragraphs taken almost word from word from Scott Cunningham's 'Wicca..' book. (This is within the first two chapters!) So I stopped reading it and shall return it tomorrow! Another problem I have is the chapter on spells comes early in the book. So I must assume this book is aimed at the ""I saw the Craft/Practical Magic etc, and now I'm a Witch"", crowd; though it was written before those movies came out. :o) ~LitGoth~"
1,Yeah. Right.,It's books like this that make me think twice about puchasing ANYTHING Llewellyn publishes.
1,Falsehoods,"Like most books claiming to tell about ""Celtic religion""and Celtic ""magic"" and most books by this author on thesubject, this book is full of inaccurate views, fantasydisguised as historical truth, and items that have beenproven time and again to be completely false."
2,"Oh dear, Oh dear....","Now, if only someone in the pagan community would decisively debunk the utterly bogus ""triple goddess"" myth. The triple goddess in celtic mythology is not only late, but represents three almost identical females, the ""Three Mothers"" -- and is NOT ""maiden, matron, crone."" Not remotely. And WHERE in the Sam Hill did that joke come from??? Puh-lease!Please dear Pagan sisters and brothers: recruit some religious history scholars to your esteemed ranks."
3,Here we go again. ;-(,"This book claims to be ""An Irish Pagan Tradition"". In my opinion; this book is simply a re-hashed version of Wicca.This book is extremely lacking in how to actualy perform magick. However; I did very much enjoy the chapter dealing with the Fairy (faery) folk. This section is worthwhile.""Wicca: A Guide For The Solitary Practitioner"" Scott Cunningham presents the most wholesome well balanced version of Wicca in all of the Wiccan books I have read so far.""A Witch Alone"" Marion Green is also very good for ideas and techniques BUT I disagree with some of her notions.The Banishing and Invoking pentagrams on page 35 are reversed. The Banishing pentagram is always drawn in a counter clockwise direction.Please E-Mail me of you have questions or comments about this review. Two Bears.Wah doh Ogedoda (We give thanks Great Spirit)"
1,Save your money for other books,"""Witta"" is not an Irish word; it appears to be manufactured from an English root. The contents of this book are generally manufactured from a mix of Wiccan books written by others, a few bits from Celtic myths, and a large measure of non-facts. McCoy appears to be trying to exploit the current market for both ""witchy"" and ""Celtic"" topics. If you want to learn about the religion of the ancient Celts, look at Miranda Green's _Gods of the Celts_ or Anne Ross' _Pagan Celtic Britain_ or Barry Cunliffe's _The Ancient Celts_. If you're interested in Celtic folk practices, look at Kevin Danaher's _The Year in Ireland_, Owen's _Welsh Folklore_ or collections of Scottish folklore such as the Carmina Gadelica."

5,I really loved this book,"I have to say that I don't understand why this book was rated so low! It is an excellent book and I would recomend it to anyone I loved!Edain is a wonderful writer and she explains everything so well, such as how to pronounce those hard ""craft"" words.This book is brilliant!"
2,Edain McCoy didnt dig deep,This book would be good if Edain would have dug a little deeper. I am interested in Witta but can't seem to find much on it other than this. Knowing what I about Ireland and the rich history this feels more like a shallow grave.
2,Not on the top of my list.,"Although it gives a bit of insight into Witta, it's not very helpful. It pretty much repeats the basics, but without much creativity. However I did find the part about faeries interesting."
1,Llewellyn Prints Anything!!!,Another book trying to pass off Wicca as a Celtic Tradition. This author seems to be living in her own fantasy world with her head in the clouds. Anyone out there who is looking for a good introduction to ancient Irish religion this is not it. I swear that so long as I live I will never read another book published by Llewellyn.
3,A good place to start exploring.,"I liked this book a lot. I thought it was huorous and interesting. Having Irish roots, it made want to explore the magick tradtions of Ireland even more. Even if McCoy did make up the name ""Witta"" as many claim, I don't see why that should matter. Often names are given to religions/faiths just for simplification in reference. (I doubt Jesus said to his followers ""Call yourself Christians"", and we all know how misunderstood the term ""Pagan"" can be). And no historical text can be trusted 100%. Nevertheless, I think this book is full of good energy, and a good starting place for those exploring Celtic magick."
3,Beautiful expression without limitations of traditionalists,"If everything stayed the same or trapped in the same definitions from the past this planet would be boring. Change is the only constant and this book is a beautiful and creative endeavor. If you don't believe in limitations or aligning yourself with a thought process that confines you to only one way of looking at things, you will love this book and recognize its beauty. If you are looking to live in the past, look elsewhere. I have immensely enjoyed the imagery and thought processes and the beauty of the material presented here. Let it be known that you do not need an alter or ritual to create magic. It is merely a symbolism that you take on as a belief. Only take on such beliefs if you are so inclined to follow the creativity that the symbolism can open within you, but know that you do not need it and therefore free your limitations."
3,Not completely useless.,"I would like to refer everyone to go read the interview of Ms. McCoy at a website that I am not allowed to divulge. :P Do a search in a search engine, you'll find it.In the interview, she explains that in fact, Witta isn't an ancient tradition, and that she did no ""classical"" research for this book. She actually sounds embarrassed that it should have caused such a ruckus, that she wrote it so badly that people would take such offense to it.I personally enjoyed the book to begin with, and when I found out how poorly researched it was, and how fabricated the history was, I was very disappointed.I feel that if you can ignore the fabricated history and the poor research, there might just be a valid path there to get ideas from for your *personal* path.Just because a tradition isn't ""ancient"" doesn't make it less valid, it just makes it new. Even ancient things were new at one time.Take it with a grain of salt, and enjoy. :}"
4,Don't try this at home,"More stunts from the Jackass gang. Nothing socially redeeming here. Nothing to be proud of. Just a lot of farting, puking, pooping, and general mayhem. When our descendants unearth this film, they will conclude that we were a hopelessly lost society. But they will be laughing their behinds off."
2,I'm calling myself a jackass for watching this movie,"Some of the stunts, pranks, and ""candid camera"" style bits are kind of fun but, like the first ""Jackass"" movie, this one contains way too many gross-out moments and scenes of gory self-mutilation. At least for me. I'm no prude (I thought ""Borat"" was hilarious), but I guess I draw the line at pushing a huge fish hook through one's cheek and drinking a liquid substance provided by an excited stallion (I refuse to sink as low as the movie and get more specific on that last description). From my experience with the first film, I guess I can't complain that I didn't know what was coming, but still... I thought I'd give it a chance. But no more. There were tons of extras on the DVD, but I passed on 'em before returning the disc to my mail-order rental service. The movie itself was quite enough, thank you."
5,jack a double s,this movie is soooo funny i was dieing laughing it keeps you haveing fun i had fum watching it...
1,Can someone tell me why this is funny?????,"This is the worst, most stupied thing I have ever seen on film. What is so funny about a group of grown men acting like idiots? I really feel sorry for these guys. What is wrong with them and what is wrong with people that actually think this is entertaining? Why is it entertainment to watch someone hurt themselves? This movie is about watching people vomit, hurt and degrade themselves. I didn't this was entertaining or funny or interesting and I worry about what kind of society we live in that anyone would pay money to watch something like this. I hate to even rate this with one star but I had no choice."
1,Pure trash!,How can anyone like this movie? this is pure insanity. It just shows where today's society is heading.
1,"TORTURE. I enjoyed the first one but, this was",just a bunch of retards torturing themselves and animals. I won't watch another one. This should be banned. The faces of death are more interesting and less torture than this.
3,Better Then the First Movie,"This one is similar to the first, but is more funny and less gross. There's still some pretty gross, (and that's an understatement,) stunts included though."
4,Ouch!!!,"This movie just plain hurt to watch all the way through. I was laughing hard because these folks do the dumb things people only talk about. The first movie was a classic (what can top rental car crash up derby), and this one just took the vulgarity and pain to a new level. This had many things that involved insertion of objects into or coming from an oraface that is usualy ment for exit only, and many things that just turn your stomach and make you want to hide behind your hands like a horror flick. Johnny knoxville is just plain funny, and bam's parents have to be the most understanding in the world. Best sketch is the switcheroo, just funny. So check this out, but definately not for kids or the faint of heart."
2,"Some good, alot not so good..",Some very funny stunts. Really like the old man/woman gags. Some stunts are just out right stupid. Movie was OK.
2,"Not as memorable as the first one, and downright uncomfortable at times...","I did like the first Jackass film, even though once you've seen it, you never have to see it again. It's not like it grows in mystery over time or anything, but it never set it sights very high. The 2nd film has a few good moments (bee limo is fun, and the guy popping out of the hotel wall is good), but it's not as memorable, and Steve-O's segments are especially ugly and masochistic. He has a fish hook put through his mouth, pukes while inhaling a man's farts through a ""gas mask"", and puts a leech on his eye. If his intention was to cause great discomfort, he succeeded. If it was to make me laugh, he failed. I really don't understand the point of the nastier stunts like this. Nasty isn't funny. The fact that the guy crack up at the end of every stunt becomes annoying after a while, because not every stunt is funny.Hopefully, this will be the last Jackass movie. There is a Jackass 2.5, but it's just outtakes from this film."
5,"Soooo funny, better than the 1st one!","Jackass 2 was one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time. I actually had to see it a 2nd time cuz I just couldn't get enough. My favorite skits were the bungee jump & Pontius w/the horse...I was crying from laughing so hard.Girls, loosen up some & go watch this movie...I did & all my girlfriends thought I was nuts. My boyfriend was even shocked w/how much I loved the movie. Everyone needs to quit being so critical about the way these guys have a good time. Laugh & enjoy yourself! I did & I can't wait to buy the DVD!"
4,Sophomore slump [3.5 stars],"I'm a huge fan of the Jackass TV show and the first movie. Some of the funniest things I've ever seen have been done by the Jackass crew.Jackass Two has some very funny moments, but the gross-out factor, for my taste, is overemphasized. This movie's short on the kind of pranks and jokes which, I think, made Jackass brilliant.If you like the show or the first movie at all, and you're not easily offended or grossed out, you should see this one as well. Just don't expect the franchise to have improved."
2,Two goes too far...,"I dunno I just don't think watching people do permanent damage to their friend's bodies is all that amusing. Seems like Jackass on MTV (and the first movie) had more clever pranks while this one was more about inflicting pain and damage. I'll admit that I turned it off at the point Steve-o did a sort of reverse beer bong, so maybe it picked up after that point...but that didn't seem likely."
2,Not as funny as the first film,This film was a little disappointing. There was less humor and more attempts at simple shock value that seemed to mostly entertain the people making the film. Please don't make a third film.
5,"CUANDO IBA A NACER MI PRIMER NIETO,","anduve por muchísimas librerías buscando EL MEJOR LIBRO PARA NOMBRES DEL BEBÉ..¡Y STE FUE !Su información es tierna, compacta, sin desperdicio de páginas y con una explicación para cada nombre!Les garantizo que fui a no menos de 14 librerías y VI MÁS DE CIEN LIBROS...¡PERO ESTE FUE EL MEJOR !!Les encantó a mi hijo y a mi nuera, Y DEHI ESCOGIERON EL HERMOSO NOMBRE PARA NUESTRO PRIMER NIETO..!se lo recomiendo a todos los futuros padres y madres.Escoger nombre, es muy delicado, PORQUE EL NIÑO O LA NIÑA SE LOS AGRADECERÁN O SE LOS REPROCHARÁN ¡TODA SU VIDA !"
2,Do Not Purchase this frustrating MP3,"We purchased this for our daughter Christmas 2006. It plays OK when you finally get the songs downloaded to the device. This takes forever though. It constantly locks up and stops. It is not our computer because we have no problems putting songs on our sons RCA MP3. Find another player. This one is very frustrating. Not sure if they have upgraded/improved it. I am very sorry we purchased this. It was a waste of money and we have purchased a different MP3 for Christmas this year, 2007."
3,Works fine.. but no boots,"I bought this in order to share files between our two Windows laptops at home - I didnt see the need to spend more for a hub. The cord works fine - when you plug it into the network ports on the two laptops the ports light up. It takes a litte configuration on Windows to get the two laptops to share files - I could get the Windows XP machine to modify files on the Windows 2000 machine, but not the other way round. But that's not a fault of hte cable.My only complaint is that the cable is just crimped at the ends, and does not have ""boots"" to protect the connectors. They should have mentioned that in the description - if I knew I would have bought the longer cable for the same price."
1,The audio-tape was not good.,"The audio-tape is read by the author of the book. He is a poor reader, and it is difficult to listen to the tape. It doesn't flow, there are mispronunciations, and he is a hesitant speaker. If you're interested in this publication, your best bet is to read the book."
1,not my kind of Christian perspective,"No surprise coming from A Beka, but it really is a shame that the title of this book includes the words, ""in Christian Perspective."" Perhaps the title could read, ""New World History and Geography in Dominionist, Anti-Communist, Fundamentalist Christian Perspective"". My son uses this book at the Christian school he attends and has come home asking why the book portrays everything done by the colonial powers as doing the good work of spreading the gospel with little mention of the evils perpetrated in the name of Christ by the colonial powers. Even apartheid in South Africa, while being criticized, is somewhat let off the hook because of their efforts in fighting communists.The book does little to educate children in critical thinking about the world, but instead spoon feeds them the preconceived notions of the Christian right. If that is what you are looking for, this book is for you."
5,This Rainbow truly shines,"I've been an avid Dolly fan since I was 5 yrs.old and am now 31. Ever since I was a kid, I've always loved this album. Growing up I was influenced by broadway, pop, folk, and rock music. It wasn't until I heard Dolly that I began to listen to country music. Reason being the first Dolly song I heard was 9 to 5. Dolly's voice is extremely well suited for this type of music proving that she can basically sing anything. My favorite tracks are The River Unbroken, Dump The Dude, Could I Have Your Autograph, Red, Hot, Screamin' Love, Make Love Work, Everyday Hero, and Saving It For You. It's a shame that this album didn't chart better back then, it truly is an awesome recording. Some albums I used to like when I was younger I can't stand now, it's not the case with this one. I love this one more now that I'm older and can understand the material that's being sung about."
5,Mado Robin a great sound,"Mado Robin's voice and style are truely wonderful and so rare. Not just the fabulous high notes but, the sweetness and evenness of tones throughout her vocal range and her impeccable diction in both songs and arias here are so special. There is nothing today like this gorgeous sound. A wonderful album. I wish there were more Robin releases."
1,Holleran Must Do Better,Nights in Aruba is a book that left me wondering why I took the time to read it. It tells the story of a gay man from his youth in Aruba through his time in the military to New York. The book did not really keep my interest and I felt as if the book was nothing more than pages filled with the laments of a middle-aged gay male who has had a life that amounted to very little.
5,A classic of autobiographical fiction,"Holleran's NIGHTS IN ARUBA is one of the first novels I read by those writers who are now described as having belonged to the Violet Quill--it was and remains one of the best. Here is a novel that reads in many ways like a memoir; at the same time, it has the dramatic movement of fiction. In this book, I particularly loved Holleran's dialogue, which is at once arch and sad and comic. A wonderful book."
5,Looking back,"This is a story about Paul, who's looking back on his early years living in Aruba. He's getting older and discovering not only the emptiness of one-night stands, but also that he's not as unlike his parents as he would like. Holleran's sense of wry humor and his astute observations about growing older as a gay man are strong in this work and make it shine. This is a novel about the inner world, so apparently the lack of outside action aggravated some reviewers. I think Andrew Holleran is one of the best writers of gay fiction, so."
1,Not well made,The lenses on the pair I received were obviously of low quality and distorted my vision to the point of discomfort. Don't waste your money on these compared to cheaper plastic safety glasses that allow for perfect sight.
2,Meh,"Not bad quality, but looks quite funny on your face.The metal is nice, but they look a little big on my face."
2,resistant,"It's very very resistant product. I liked it. It's very strong but it's not light. If you don't matter, buy it."
4,Nice Glasses but not as large as I'd hoped,"I bought these for use a the range, they are nice but are too small for my head. I gave them to someone with an average size head. I really liked them and hope I can find something simular in a larger size."
1,Marginally Better than plastic,"Looking for a quality set of silverware? Keep Looking! If you are used to eating with plastic, this is a step up, but barely. Most people use the dinner fork more than any instrument and this dinner fork weighs about the same as a plastic fork, it looks better [nice and shiny]. These are equivalant to something you could buy at a discount store for pretty cheap"
2,Three chirps (unit failure) after 4 years,"Like others, this alarm went off (""fire"") in the middle of the night for no reason. Two days later, after I changed the batteries to be safe, it was giving the triple chirps.I've yet to call the company for a replacement.EDIT: They would send me a replacement for $6.50. They wouldn't accept a cc payment over the phone, but instead required a check to be mailed. I asked them to email the info on sending out the check, and they didn't have any email services either. I told them to forget the whole thing, and then they offered to send me the replacement immediately for free (waiving the $6.50 fee)."
2,great until it failed 2 months later,"I thought I got a great deal on this combo item, but it only worked for three months before failing. I guess when it comes to my family's safety I shouldn't be so concerned with the best price and just buy an item like this from a local store that I can return it to with no problems."
1,Remote triggers alarm,"I'm sure this alarm works for what it's intended. Luckily I have never had a fire or carbon monoxide situation. The problem is the added ""features."" It has a feature where you can have any remote turn off false alarms. Unfortunately the remote also triggers test alarms every time you use the remote. That means you can't have this smoke detector anywhere you have a tv or other electronics. For most families that is a majority of rooms in the house. This feature can be turned off but every time you change the batteries you need to remember to turn it off again. Very annoying and impractical."
4,Good basic warning device,"I almost bought the SC07CN combo alarm but got frustrated with all the extra bells and whistles that added complicated features like remote and voice. I believe the SC05CN is all a person needs to protect against carbon monoxide poisoning and smoldering type fires. A person should also have a detector that detects hot flaming fires like the ionization type detectors. I'm not aware of a single device that senses both types of fires and carbon monoxide so it seems a person would need at least two detectors to cover all three circumstances. I already had wired-in ionization smoke detectors, but added the CO/photoelectric combo to gain the additional coverage. Only an emergency will ultimately prove the value and performance of this device, but in the meantime I have a little peace of mind that I should be able to be warned of two types of fires and/or carbon monoxide."
1,Dont waste your money,"I bought this item to protect my family, instead it scares the living daylights out of them. This unit goes off all on its own and screems a warning message and then says there is no fire or carbon Dioxide detected. What the hell is it going off for if nothing is detected. Do not buy this product. This product made my four year old afraid to sleep in his room, thanks a lot I would like to go to the home of the idiot who designed this alarm and wake up his or her children in the middle of the night by screeming in there ears and yelling Danger and then say there is no danger detected."
1,"Fails Fire Inspection In Watertown, MA","At least for my fire department, the alarm does not do a good enough job of distinguishing between fire warnings and carbon monoxide warnings.I wasted my money not only on this hunk of plastic but also on the failed fire inspection. (Luckily for me, I have time for another inspection before the closing date on our home.)Get a ""talking"" detector to be on the safe side.Sean"
5,Safe At Last!,"In the state of Washington a carbon monoxide detector is required in all newly constructed homes and in all homes being sold as of 2013. So, I looked around and found this great smoke AND carbon monoxide detector combination - a win win! The item is the same size as a common smoke detector, installs easily and is unobtrusive on the wall. And it does not require a 9 volt battery, just regular AA, something almost everyone has in the house. A 'test' of the alarm confirmed that it will wake you up and get you moving to the closest exit - very loud. I bought a second one to have for the new home we are buying."
5,Perfect for my application,"Well constructed Smoke and Carbon Monoxide detector. Has a neat mounting system. A person does not need to apply force to remove it. The batteries can be replaced without and hassle at all and without removing the unit from the wall, if they choose.. Much easier and neater to replace batteries than any other smoke detector I have used over the year's."
1,"Junk, unless you enjoy middle-of-the night ""testing"" alarms","Within two weeks of purchasing this alarm, it started blaring ""testing"" followed by several loud beeps for the smoke alarm, several loud other beeps for the CO alarm, and then a report that CO was ""zero point zero ppm."" It did this four times in the last two days, including twice in the middle of the night. Needless to say, I'm not very happy.I tried to call First Alert for a replacement, per the other reviewers, and they never picked up their phone. I was on hold a couple of times, with no luck."
1,spurious self tests caused by smart meter?,"unit is less than 1 year old and randomly initiates CO alarm self tests. Today it almost continuously running the self test routine. It is going into the trash ASAP.revised 12/27/2012 - We have a new ""smart"" electrical meter and the net is full of reported interference issues with the RF generated by these meters.Moved my first alert alarm away from the outside wall where the smarty meter is mounted and have not had any issues since then."
4,Easy to install,I ordered and installed seven First Alert alarms in my home. They were very easy to install. They appear to be working perfectly and I have not had a single false alarm (e.g. kitchen or bathroom steam).
1,False alarms 5-8 times a day,"This is a piece of junk. Don't even bother buying this thing because you will lose your hearing with the amount of false alarms that go off. Horrible, horrible, horrible. Changed batteries, changed locations and it still is doing the same thing. There was a recall on these a couple of years ago by the government and I'm not surprised that First Alert hasn't cleaned up their act. HORRIBLE. Can I say it enough? NO!"
1,"Junk, Keeps going off when hall light is turned on","I have had it with the junk that First Alert produces and I have replaced all my First Alert detectors with Kiddie detectors. This thing goes into test mode when the stairwell light is turned on, this has happened at least 2 dozen times.I will be sending all of them back to the company with a note about the poor products they produce.Don't waste your money on this product, you will not be happy."
1,Stopped working within a month.....,"I thought maybe a bought a dud but after reading previous reviews, I had the same issues. Within a month mine started beeping to replace the alarm. I foolishly thought this couldn't be and replaced the batteries. Within a couple days it was beeping again. I paid over 30 bucks for this and now I'm here again shopping for another alarm. Stinks to have to shell out all that money again. I'm getting a different brand this time around. Oh well...."
1,Location Dependant?,"I have rental properties and I decided to upgrade all units to have monoxide detectors. I decided on this unit because it is a two in one device and it used double AA batteries instead of the nine volts. My tenants keep complaining that these devices keep beeping. I looked on the back and 3 chirps = bad detector. I took a few of them down, put up the old ones and brought them to my home. They have not chirped since. Something about the other place is making these detectors fail.Another thing is that I did not notice this but there is a 5 year life on these detectors and then they will chirp without any choice but to replace them. So even if yours works at first, you only will get 5 years out of it. I bought a total of 7 of these that cost me a few hundred and now I need to look for replacements. I wish I left all the old smoke detectors in."
1,Stupid remote mute,"My problem is the remote mute. I think the premise here was to enable you to cancel a false alarm with a tv remote. The instructions say to mount somewhere that a remote would not interfere with the unit. Well, in my house that spot is nowhere! The remote feature also tests the unit. Everytime a tv was turned up or down the unit woulod sound off!Stupid idea. Are your products that bad that they give off so many false alarms that someone felt this feature was neccesary!"
5,Good Combo,These were bought to replace others. Never had any problems. Combo preferred over buying two units for smoke and carbon monoxide.
2,First Alert Detector,"I would not recommend this item at all. The batteries has to be replace about every 3 weeks. Very aggravating. Basically, this is an over-priced, over-rated piece of junk."
4,GReat Book,"Recently I read the great book Chazown by Craig Groeschel. I know I am a little late reading this book but it was a must read on my list. Craig's writing style is really what makes his books so attractive. Craig is very experienced and wise but that does not always translate into a great book. Chazown is all about discovering the vision for your life and for you church, ministry, or business. It is a great book to read whether you need a refresher on vision or you are simply lost and need direction. Craig writes this book from his life experiences in college and starting a church from scratch. He is not afraid to be brutally honest and speak of his failures and lack vision at times. I would recommend this book to anyone. It is refreshing to see someone who is so transparent in his writing. Chazown will upstart or refresh this vision and drive for your life."
3,"A Dream, Vision or Revelation ~ Chazown","I appear to have a recurring theme with the books I am choosing to review. They are all about how to make my life mean something and how to make a difference. Just looking at the title of the book lets me know I'm on the right path (for reading). This book helps set you on the right path for knowing your purpose. I love this quote from the book,""I have been created and put on earth for a unique and important purpose. And God intends for me to know it and live it with passion and fulfillment for His glory."" Yes!Thank you Waterbrook for providing me with a complimentary copy of this book to review."
2,"A Good Guide for the Beaten Path, But Not a Trailblazer","I really appreciate the preaching and publishing of Craig Groeschel; his easy-going style, his authenticity, his transformative message.The book with the funny title, Chazown, had not been on my radar until I saw it offered by Blogging for Books as a free book for review. When it arrived, I put aside what I was working on, and dug right in. The topic of personal vision and how to find it is not unfamiliar, which is perhaps why I found the material cliched and not up to par with his original thinking from previous books.Reviewers seem to be mixed on Chazown, depending, it seems to me, on whether they had done much reading on the topic. If it was new, and you were seeking, this fit the bill; if wasn't, it was old hat.For those looking for some guidance and some passion, Groeschel will be a good guide for the beaten path, but not a trailblazer.FTC Disclaimer: I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review."
5,Ride The Wave,"This book has allowed me to go beyond my day to day rut and enter into a life with vision. Chazown gave my family a format to get our lives on a track that directs us on a path of freedom in many different aspects of our lives. Chazown has been so helpful in understanding God's will for our lives and how we can get on board and ride the wave of life, without fear, but confidence, because the goals are set before us....and they are attainable!!!!"
4,Are you on target for God's purpose?,This book presents a great way to evaluate if you are seeking out God's purpose in your life and if you understand what his purpose is for your life. I'm not yet through with the book but so far it's great. I noticed it even comes with a cool DVD in the back.
2,Thinly veiled self-help,"Groeschel may have very good intentions, but in this book he misappropriates Bible verses and suggests that God is out to fulfill all of our dreams. While following God as a Christian can certainly lead to personal fulfillment, Jesus calls Christians to ""take up their cross"" to follow Him. Read the Bible alongside this book and you will quickly see that Grosechel's advice, while practical, is not necessarily Christian nor Biblically-based. This is Americanized Christianity: thinly veiled self-help with a Christian twist. I'm glad this book can be helpful to some people, but I hope readers also realize the messages in here are not God's heart for His people. Surrender, faith, and obedience are much more important to God than personal fulfillment and living out our wildest dreams. In my opinion, this book just promotes the shallow Christianity that is so prevalent in our society today."
4,Nothing New And Everything New,Chazown by Craig Groeschel was a great read. Much of the information in the book is stuff that I have read in the past. But Craig does a great job of bringing it all together.Cazown was also a very practical book as it gives you great tools to begin the process of defining your vision and discovering your passions and purpose.A great tool to use with small groups.
3,just Ok,"I enjoyed the beginning of the book and felt like it might help me in the time of uncertainty that I am currently facing, however i felt like it was all very surface, and more like the advice that you might get from Oprah.I feel like the aim of the book is good, and that the authors goal to get people to realize what they are passionate about is important. It just seemed like it didn't go into depth, it could more or less be summed up in, ""whatever your passionate about go after it"". which is a not quiet what I was hoping for from this book.I am not saying that this is a bad book or that it should not be read, I am just saying that it didn't really mean a lot to me. I feel like the Gospel is so much more deep and rich than just, go do what your passionate about, who ever said that this was al supposed to be about us anyway.I can say that I like the author's writing style, it is easy to read, I also liked the way the book was laid out with the very short sections, it kept it interesting."
5,Change Your Life!!!,"If you are looking for your passion in life this book will lead you in the right direction. It will help you live your life on purpose and help you find the real core values in your life. We all need to find our ""CHAZOWN""!!!!"
3,"Good, sound advice","Chazown is a Bible-based approach to life planning based on five key focus areas of God, People, Finances, Health and Work. It has 76 chapters but each is only two or three pages long. The brevity makes for fast reading of each chapter but made it difficult to go into any deep thinking. There are lots of personal anecdotes and good sound advice for finding your purpose in life. But somehow I expected something more challenging and grander, given the title which is taken from the Hebrew language."
2,"Awful narration! Droning, Monotone voice ruined it - get foodmatters instead","The Gerson method has helped many, many folks and the story is amazing. However, the announcer for this documentary has such a droning, monotone voice that I couldn't watch the whole film. I literally couldn't stay interested - he essentially ruined it for me.If you want to know about Gerson and don't want to sit through hours of droning, monotone narration just get FoodmattersFoodmattersinstead. It is MUCH more interesting to watch,Is filmed in a far superior, captivating manner, and discusses Gerson along with other interesting and useful information about food, nutrition and health.Summary: the droning voice of the announcer will put you to sleep - get foodmatters dvd instead."
2,NO therapy details. Only GENERAL info.,"If you have just been Dx'ed with cancer or another illness and are wanting this video for quick info on the plan you will NOT find it here. This DVD is very general info about the state of our poluted malnurished world and why we are so sick. There is some history of the Gerson therapy and family that is touching. There are no recipes or protocals here. There is mention of the coffee and juicing but NO details of the program. If program protocal is what you are looking for this is a waist of your valuable time (especially if you are seriously ill). Instead perhaps (I say perhaps because i have not read them yet)go straight to the book(s). Speaking of the books, the book covers were shown in this DVD several times. Maybe this is a good view for some but not for those who need protocal info."
3,Ritalin makes people uncontrollable?,"I have a feeling that this diet / therapy works however the producers of this video lost my trust when they stated that Ritalin causes permanent brain damage and makes people uncontrollable. I agree that people would most likely be better off not taking Ritalin however my parents forced me to take it as a child and I wouldn't consider myself to be brain damaged or a rabid dog as this video suggests.When you consider that the target group for this video is free thinkers it's probably not a good idea to use scare tactics that are obvious lies to make people stop using Ritalin or anything else. That's exactly what the mainstream media, doctors and big corporations do to scare people into spending money and is the very reason people watch videos such as this. People are tired of lies and feeling like junk with no where to go.I would have given this video a 5 star rating if it had not been for the Ritalin lie."
1,THE GERSON MIRACLE,I have never written a review before but felt compelled to write this. I think this video is just a pot boiler and does not contain ANY new info and I am very disappointed that I spent money on this video - It is NOT edited and you have to view the whole video to see the contents as well as that it doesn't tell you anything valuable at all. Don't waste your money on this!
1,POOR PRODUCT,"THIS DVD IS WASTE OF MONEY , PARTICULARLY I PAID FOR INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING , I COULD NOT FOUND ANY INFORMATIONS FOR GERSON THERAPIES , EVEN ANY RECEPIES FOR SOME DISEASES , OR PLAN FOR HEALTHY DIET.I AM NOT HAPPY ABOUT THIS PRODUCT .THE INFORMATION ABOUT THIS DVD WAS NOT ONEST OR CLEAR ON AMAZON ."
1,Not buying the Gerson Claims,"Save yourself some money. The movie says the cure for cancer is juicing, organic vegetables, sticking organic coffee up your butt, and a few vitamins."
2,review,The narrator is very bad....he is not understandable..??? one gives up and fedup from listening...also pictures / images are discusting
3,Its a nice video with Hope,"As for cancer and fear mode this is a hopefilled video and alternatives to all those western medical CUT BURN AND DRUG THINKING MENTALITY OF MEDICINE. I just wish people without money had somewhere to go for help,, this comes with clinics and no mention of treatment plan costs and to ask anything in these field for answers always comes with evasiveness and answers with cost so no one in this world does anything to help anyone without money. What a shame"
4,Very good,This should be watched by all cancer patients and anyone willing to pull their head out of the sand and see life other than what they see on Television news or Oprah. You should ask yourself. Why can't this be put on say the Discovery Channel or The History Channel . It has to be better than the other junk they air.
5,Unbe....lievable,"As soon as I began watching thi video, I knew I was going to try the therapy. I don't have cancer, but I have Hepatitis C and am chronically fatigued. I already started purchasing what the book suggested. Oh yeah, buy the book ""The Gerson Therapy. You will need to buy eqipment, supplements, and alot of vegetables. It's only been four days and I feel much better. I'm buying the supplements and the juicer tomorrow. I haen't even started the juicing and the supplements yet. I've only began the enama treatment (which I had to get used to). This introduces a large amount of glutathione into your body. I looked it up and it said that glutithione should be given intravenously for better absorption. The other way is rectally. Wow, I feel great already. Gotta go. Thanks Dr. Max Gerson."
3,Great info. but,"This film provides excellent information as do the other films on the same subject. (The Beautiful Truth and Dying to Know) The info. in this film rates 5 stars but the camera work is so amateurish it's very difficult to watch and very distracting. I recommend closing your eyes during the worst filming which is most of the film. Perhaps doing some menial job like washing dishes or preparing veggies for juicing while listening instead of trying to watch and listen. It's a shame a professional camera operator wasn't used, at least to help skeptics find some credibility in the info. presented. I do recommend all to at least listen to the film."
2,the gerson miracle,The movie would not play. Iwanted to see the movie because Gerson is one of the most prime and famous of all the doctors of degenerative diseases. Iwas disappointed I could not exchange it.
4,Unusual alternative,Interesting science and theory for alternative treatment and preventative therapy.Not certain how much contemporary support there is for the precept.If you like documentaries it's worth a look.
4,The CD is finally out.,"Mouthwash was featured on the Hellcat Records complilation ""Give 'Em The Boot,Vol.2"" and ever since then I have been waiting for a full length album. The CD 1,000 Dreams was well worth the wait. The album has plenty of good punk songs like ""Drop The Bomb"" and ""One For Sorrow"". There is also some ska influenced songs like ""Fool's Gold"",""Live Like Kings"" and ""We Evolve"". Overall ""1,000 Dreams"" has plenty of variety that should appeal to ska/punk fans everywhere."
4,Welcome to America...,"Just met these guys at McDonalds (as they call it, Mac-Donals), and they are definitely a cool group. My buddies and I are checking them out tomorrow night live. I'm definitely picking up the CD, and I've already got a few songs that are unbelievable. This is the next generation of ska/punk."
5,good if you are on the go a lot,Good if you do not leave your computer on everyday or for long periods. Convenient because you can charge whereever there is an outlet available. Must make sure usb is connected to charger.
5,works great.,"i've had this charger for over 2 years and have never had a problem with it. unlike most of the reviews, i did my research and knew i would have to use my usb cable to link my zune to the charger. this is perfect for me because i also have other mp3 players and can use this charger to charge my devices. sorta like an all in one for me, lol.it charges my devices well and never over heats. its also stylish."
4,"Does the Job, But",I take my Zune to work each day and view a few Podcasts as time permits. As you know video eats up battery time in a hurry. So I wanted to be able to keep the Zune charged so it would last throughout my 10 hour work day. I was looking for a connector that would connect the Zune directly to the AC outlet. That is what I thought I was buying based on the way things looked. And the add for the connector was not real clear that you still need your regular Zune charging cord to be able to connect the SlimCharger to the Zune. It works but it could have been an all in one connection. Too Bad!
3,Ok USB charger but pricey,"I bought this charger because I was in a pinch heading on vacation and it's all they had at the store I was at. It was hard parting with $30 for this knowing I could really use any USB charger to do the trick. It seems to charge just as fast as plugging into your computer usb port.One curious issue I have had, and I don't know if this is just related to this charger, but when my Zune 30gb's battery is completely or very close to completely depleted, this charger will not charge the battery. I have left it plugged in for an hour or more and the little AC charging icon never appears. I tried resetting, different outlets, etc. but nothing. As soon as I plug into a USB port on my PC the battery instantly starts charging however. Again, not sure if this is the charger or the Zune."
2,Not what I expected,I was very disappointed in this item because it required me use my current USB cable. I wanted and thought I was getting a wall charger that plugged directly into the Zune.
2,My mistake: I didn't read the Amazon review,"The reviewer below this one was right. The Monster charger does not plug directly into my Zune and requires the Zune cable for use. I missed the review. If I had read it I would have never bought this product.While I made a mistake, Monster made a bigger one. Why advertise this charger for a Zune knowing it will not connect directly?My guess: The charger was for other products and some brilliant Monster marketing exec proposed that they also sell it for Zune - no added development charges, pure profit. A BS line extension resulted!"
3,A fairly interesting guide to most of the law schools in the,"country. I'm not sure how often the passages on each schools are updated but I bought the 1999 edition and found it to be a refreshging departure from the usual bland statistics that are quoted in other books. It is nice to hear from students even though I do agree that the authors try to make every law school appealing. I also found the admissions section to be annoying because the authors seem to suggest that every law school is difficult to gain admission too. In conclusion, I certainly wouldn't use this book as my sole guide to law schools but I think that it is a nice compliment to the ABA book."
1,lacked accuracy,The admissions standards potrayed in the book are the authors opinion. The book put out by the LSAC has most of the school's actual admission decisions.
5,Make reloading by hand easy,"I enjoy this new addition to my reload bench, I used to use the lee press 3 die press and kept having issues with correct powder but after getting this its been easier to watch how much powder I put into each bullet. Great product and qucik shipping."
5,A wonderful introduction to art & sculpture for children.,"Molly chases Constable's rainbow, dances with Degas's ballerina, dodges Turner's train,plays guitar with Picasso's musicians, and floats on Monet's lily pad. This is a wonderful and fun way of introducing painting and sculpture into the lives of imaginative young readers"
4,A Good Product at a Good Price Point,"This product was as advertised, came out of the box, and worked. I don't have any qualatative way of determining whether the purified air meets the manufacturers specifications. I could not give it a 5 rating because it is a little loud when compared to some other air cleaners that I have that move a similar volume of air."
2,Worked ok for a year,"This worked ok for a year, but then it was not performing as well and occassionally we saw smoke coming from it. We cleaned it over and over and this seemed to make no difference. Finally we just replaced it with a different model."
5,I love this deck!,"This is my favorite Tarot deck. The cards were drawn by the author herself who has many years of experience reading tarot cards. The pictures drawn on the cards were inspired by the author's Native American heritage. The suits are Thunderbirds, Frogs, Turtles, and Butterflies each of which stem from Native American folk lore. The book that accompanies the deck is very thorough and clear in explaining each card, and helps the reader gain insight into what the cards are saying. In the book, the author also writes about her own personal experiences reading tarot cards. I highly recommend this deck. I felt a connection to these cards from the beginning, and the deck is now my favorite."
3,Thinking dark thoughts,"Following the discovery of an unusual form of alien possession, the TARDIS crew set off to the planet Arden to trace the source of the possession. It is not what they expect...On close review, this novel by first-time author Christopher Bulis doesn't necessarily have much outstanding about it. It is a pretty standard sort of story, the kind that Doctor Who has been filled with. This is not, by the way, a bad thing - while we may hope for outstanding stories, they wouldn't be outstanding if we didn't have the more run-of-the-mill to compare them to.The novel, however, isn't poor. Some of the characterisation could be better, the plotline improved, but these are not unexpected thins in a first novel.I did enjoy the ultimate baddy of this novel, I'm not sure why. The fact that I did, however, did raise this novel up a bit for me."
1,In one word: Bad!,"The Doctor, Benny, and Ace go on adventure on the planet Arden. Unfortunately, the adventure consists of a badly-written man-versus-nature plot, complete with an Eco-friendly environmental ""message"".Worse, the book contains dozens of typos. I found myself literally correcting the mistakes as I read. A typical example can be found on page 241, where an entire sentence is ruined because there are so many typographical errors. I found 40 typos in this slim, 244 page novel, just reading it."
4,I was unsettled by both sides of the educational equation,"I felt angry to read of the difficulties Jennings had living and going to school in inner city D.C. Why do people have to pull down those who have vision and ambition? And not just in the inner city I'm afraid. There is an anti-intellectual, anti-learning, anti-caring about anything climate nationwide. This book just reveals it to us more than we like to admit to ourselves. Then I felt angry to read of the airheadedness and political indoctrination at Brown University. He (the young man who was the subject of this book) poured his heart and soul into ""making it"" and was ""it"" worth it? All in all, it was a good read. Well written and thought provoking."
2,Deserving of a Pulitzer?,"My only real compliant with this book is why does it take a white reporter for the Wall Street Journal for this story to be acceptable and validated? I know plenty of students from the inner-city who defy the odds on a daily basis (I am one of those students myself) and it bothers me that it is not until a white person writes this story that our voices get heard. I am sure that there are folks that will argue that at least our stories are getting told and we should be grateful. However, I am concerned about the invisibility of poor and minority folks from the inner city and the politics involved in journalism. Had this story been written by a person of color would it have garnered the same type of public attention? I sincerely doubt it. I applaud Cedric and all of his hard work and dedication. I am just not convinced that Suskind is deserving of a Pulitzer Prize...."
3,"In U, U dare to hope","The protagonist makes no excuses for himself. I love that. I think he realised early on (after the book was written) that he wanted to be most of all ""real."" It wasn't to be about how he overcame, living in the ghetto etc but more importantly, the emotions and finding himself.At certain points, I am like this kid is not a very pleasant person but even with that I could understand where he was coming from. This made him real.He also along the way learnt he was in charge of his and only his destiny. He couldn't pull his siblings up. or his mom and I think for the longest time that must have irked him a lot.He had to also learn to let go of this incessant rage murking in his soul. He had to face these demons so he could finally interact in the real world in a full capacity. This was not easy for him to do and he had so many missteps.This is a tale not fairy tale perfect but gritty and still on-going, right now as we speak.Cheers,"
4,Hoop Dreams Without The Hoops,"Everyone loves an underdog, and Cedric Jennings, the subject of Ron Suskind's book, earned my love just by getting up and going to school in the morning. Despite the harassment of inner-city DC bullies, thugs and slime, Cedric found a way to tap his potential and thrive---just as he knew he could. Just as he knew he HAD TO in order to survive. With good insight and emotion, Suskind tells the story of a young man who has all of the tools---and all of the obstacles. Great reading. Great insight into the plight and poverty of the inner-city, the courage of a remarkable young man and the unquantifiable nature of determination. Go, Cedric, Go! You da man!"
4,A story of sheer human perserverence,"I am a freshman at a small liberal arts school, and this book was given to me by the school as a common reading experience for the entire entering class. The book presented many facets of life that I have never known, and probably never will; however, this true account of Cedric's life brings to the forefront what is lacking in today's public schools; congruence. But despite the lack of congruence, Cedric, through his own will and determination, found a way to succeed.This book was an amazing eye-opener to me as it presented me with how many different lives people have, and how hard it actually is to melt everyone into one pot. This book; however, shows that it can be done, and it can possibly give hope to people that don't think that they can quite make it."
2,Required Reading,It was required for me to read this for college. I would not have read it otherwise. It was boring.
1,What a JOKE!,"Save your money, but more importantly SAVE YOUR TIME!I would have rather gone to the doctor for a proctology exam!This was probably the MOST OVERRATED BOOK I HAVE VER READ!"
5,A Great Book and A great author,"Ron Suskind is a neighbor and good friend of mine. His story about Cedric Jennings, and the poverty he had to put up with is beautifully told. I have not yet finished the book, but I know that Ron will finish it in an extraordinary way."
5,Crossing the line of diversity,"Get ready for an all nighter...this book is extremely captivating! As you've probably read through the editorial reviews, it is the story of an African American young man in his last year of high school and in his beginning college years. I had to read this book for a college diversity class as we were discussing the baggage different ethnicities carry with them at all times. This book showed me the world through the eyes of Cedric, an African American boy struggling to overcome his hardships and make something of his life. Suskind did a wonderful job at getting inside Cedric's head and writing the book in his perspective. This book is definitely one of the best books I have read in a while and certainly opened my eyes to a different world. I highly recommend this book for any college student living on a diverse campus or for anyone who is searching for a wonderful story."
4,A Rare Find,Rarely does one find a writer that tells a story so simply and compelling. From the start the reader is drawn into Cedric's world. This is not a black boy's world but a child's/adolescent's world. Suskind tells Cedric's story with detachment yet interest. From the start I needed to know how Cedric faired. I recounted my freshman college days with glee.
3,a hope in the unseen,"I found this book, while not without it's flaws, quite enjoyable to read. In fact once i started to read it I found it hard to put down. Although I have taken into consideration the fact that Suskind probably wrote a considerable amount of it through his own biased ""rose colored glasses"" and not completely the way a journalist should. But i must comend him on his riveting story telling. He does a very good job of keeping his readers envolved and emotional connected with Cedric at all times, no matter how different his life may be from our own. Overall this is ceratinly a book worth reading."
1,A Hope in the Unseen: An American Odyssey from the Inner City to the Ivy League,"I was not happy with this orders, Bluewater. The book wasn't new as advertised, and was really a disappointment. This was first time using this company, and I will not be ordering from them again."
4,A very good book with lots of warnings for college freshmen.,"As an student entering my first year of college, at Albion, this book presented a nice story of Cedric Jennings struggle. The words told as Cedric is in Brown however really told me that I was do for a great change. I'm sure Cedrics great clash of cultures is much larger the mine, and most people, however it does warn that there are changes in store that will not be forseen and that these can all be overcome with the right attitudes.I would suggest that anyone leaving for college might want to read this well written book."
4,Inspirational Story,"What a great book! It was recommended to me by a teacher. I'm really glad I read it.It's amazing how this author, who is white, can get into the mind of a black youth. He did a great job. I can identify with Cedric since I also a minority and urban, if not inner-city, youth trying to get into Brown U.Sometimes I find the constant racial labeling of people annoying but it is a theme in the book. Also, I find the homophobia of Cedric a little disappointing. But then again, his background did not prepare him for that and he had strong religious beliefs. At least he was trying to adjust to the idea.Other than that, the book is very worthy."
4,Wonderful story!,A riveting tale of a yound man's struggle to overcome tremendous adversity and achieve his full potential. Very well written.
4,I LOVED IT,"I loved this video. I had never seen him before and to see him on this video was wonderful. I loved his voice, dance moves, and he was also very handsom. I only wish there was more videos of this handsom, talented man."
3,"Whew boy, talk about feeling old!!!","I really enjoyed the video even though it's so . . . 60's. It was fun watching the dancers and wonder: ""Did I dance like that?"""
2,"Functional, but Poorly Made","Product was intact when it arrived, but the metal was severely scratched and the solders between the bottom of each shelf and the shelf sides were poorly done. And the metal portions of the shelf bases do not sit flat. We initiated a return with amazon, but the manufacturer said that they wanted to exchange the product for a replacement. We were okay with that but after more than a week, I received a notice that they were refunding my money instead--so buyer beware, maybe the quality on all units is sub-par."
5,very moving,"""The Real Me"", is the best rock song ever made. Just listen to how the instruments breath and talk truly representing the player's personality, no one did it better. Townsend at his most powerful."
1,Poor value.,"Over $100 for this? a) Only some of the tracks are 5.1. b) No Who demos, all Pete. No Who outtakes. No Who alternate versions. c) Some of the demos have added (redone) drums. d) No extra live stuff either. e) The 5.1 mixes aren't even that great. Tommy was much better. More immersive, more ""powerful"". Shame. Even if we would have just gotten the whole thing as 5.1 I would have been happy. But no. This is a half effort ... and for over $100. Looks at Dark Side of the Moon or Wish You Were Here for how it should be done."
3,The remastered version is not as good as the original.,"Qudrophenia ranks as one the best rock operas of all time. Every song is powerful and moving. However, I believe the remastered version does not measure up its original, especially in the song ""drowned,"" where the piano cannot be heard. I feel this ruined the whole album for me. If you can get hands on the original, do it!"
2,Saudades do vinil,"Ok, isto já é demais! O disco deveria ser encarado como trilha sonora e acaba sendo um ""quadrophenia"" (assim mesmo, caixa baixa) reduzido. O original, pelo menos, continha James Brown e Booker ""T"" & the MG's."
3,"Pete, release the 12/4/73 concert!","The Quadrophrenia tour was notoriously problematic, but on a fabled night at the Spectrum in Philly, the Who were absolute magic. Parts of the show were broadcast on King Biscuit, and this has been bootlegged repeatedly for years. Legendary concert, and priceless rendition of Townsend's autobiography."
2,WHO-SOUNDS,"The Who have some of the greatest songs but at the same time the worstsound recordings and mike and sound-mixing jobs of all the Rock-and-Roll bands on Records, especiallythe live concerts on DVD. It is a shame for paying so little attention."
5,One of the best Rock CDs of all time...,"Quadrophenia is an epic rock album that showcases the Who's musicianship and Pete Townshend's songwriting prowess. The story itself stands on its own, but who buys an album for it's story? It's the thundering power of the most dynamic rock and roll foursome that ever graced a stage. Keith Moon's drumming is brilliant; John Entwistle's bass is played like a lead instrument, and often it is Townshend's guitar work that is the anchor and foundation of the music, giving the driving force to many glorious songs. ""The Real Me"" is a perfect example of this. If you like classic rock music, this album is already in your collection."
3,Remastered Quadrophenia songs have more oomph.,"The omission of the Motown songs is no great loss to me. In fact, I don't even care about the film so much. But the remastered versions of the Quad songs are _much_ ballsier than the originals. This is due to bassist John Entwistle re-recording the bass parts with an eight-string bass, wiping some superfluous keyboard parts, and restoring some great Keith Moon drum parts. Thus, ""5:15"" sounds like the hit it should have been, and ""Bell Boy"", ""Doctor Jimmy"", and ""The Punk Meets the Godfather"" are even more dramatic than before. The only miscues are his decision to fade ""Love Reign O'er Me"" instead of using the gong ending, and using a conventional ending for ""The Real Me"" instead of the ""me-ME-me-ME-me"" vocal ending. An optional purchase for casual fans, but a solid pick for real Who-heads."
1,Really?????,"I agree with the other reviews that this remaster is the pits! It's been 30 years since I listen to the original Quadrophenia on vinyl and I wish I had let those memories alone. Maybe in a nod to their fallen band mates, Keith and John's parts are relegated to the background in the mix. While the raw aggression of the original recording remains on some tracks the overall effort is a bomb. Love the songs but this remaster SUCKS!"
3,Mixed Blessing,"I'm not about to shell out more than $100 for anything, so the Smile, Some Girls and Quadrophenia deluxe editions won't make it into my house. So the good news is that you can download all the music for a fraction of the price. I was pretty excited to see this on iTunes for $24 and bought it right away but should have waited. It's $19 on Amazon and $16 on eMusic. Live and learn.I think the remix sounds great and a lot of the bonus material is pretty cool until you realize that all (?) the bonus tracks seem to be Townshend demos with nothing really new. This is too bad, since Who versions of a lot of the outtakes exist. Three were featured on the Quadrophenia movie soundtrack, and the full band version of ""Joker James"" is pretty lively. On the other hand, the Townshend-only version of ""Helpless Dancer"" is embarrassing.The only way the deluxe set works is for someone who has some extra money and wants to express big love to a less wealthy Who fanatic, and gives it as a present."
3,Only Half as Good as it should be (5.1 EP?!?!?!),"Remastered CDs = greatDemo CDs = greatBook = best part of the whole set5.1 EP = worst part of the setI've become a huge fan of 5.1 surround in the past few years, and I was really disappointed that this box set only contains half of the album in surround. In my experience with surround releases, it's usually the whole album or nothing, and in this case I'm not really sure what I'd rather have..."
5,A true rock masterpiece,"Quadrophenia is one of the greatest rock albums in history {save for Sgt. Pepper, The Wall, Tommy, and (in my opinion) anything by Queen.) This record ranges from ballads (Love Reign O'er Me, featuring Roger at his best) to ""Adrenaline Rock"" {5:15, (my personal favorite,) The Real Me} to a fast groove of sorts (Drowned) to the slower sounds of Pete Townshend, (Cut My Hair, I'm One.) Each member of the group tries their hardest to sound their best, from the thrashing beats of the unforgettable Keith Moon, to John Entwistle's pounding bass, to Pete Townshend's unbelievable guitar work, to Roger Daltrey's fantastic performance on all but 6 of the tracks, (four were instrumentals, two were Townshend vocals.) This is truly one of the greatest rock pieces of all time. A must-have for the fanatic or someone who's just learning about The Who."
5,The greatest rock opera masterpiece in rock and roll history,"More than just the soundtrack to a movie, or the soundtrack to everybody's lives in the midst of teenage angst or frustration with the state of the world. Every piece is arranged together wonderfully, and it most likely has reached out to millions of all ages across several generations, and will probably continue to do so. If I was alive in the 60s, I would have been honored to experience the music scene the way it was, real genuine original and raw. But virtually everything has lost appeal nowadays."
5,The Real Me,The Who dominated the 60s and 70s as one of the best groups around. This is no exception. The second rock opera is just a classic as classic can be. For what it was and when it was made this has to be up there as one of the most creative albums of all time. This is a must have for music fans. Just listen and be amazed. Classic Classic Classic. The Who is one of the best bands ever and this is a highlight with no holes.
5,The Whos Greatest Album!!,i never really sat down and listened to this album and i grew up in 60s and 70s and i was blown away!!this is now my favorite album from that Era.
2,Could And Should Have Been Better,"First time I heard this album was in 1980 and thus became the soundtrack of my teen years and young adult life. So when I discovered Quadrophenia was getting the box treatment, I was moderately excited at this release though proceeded with caution. Took a chance and purchased the director's cut on Amazon and upon listening was terribly dissapointed. No where in sight was the OG 1973 mix. The demo discs had Pete add drums played by some unknown to his beautiful demo recordings. Why, who knows. Doesn't add anything. If not taking the time to remaster the OG 73 mix (or at least presenting the entire 96 mix in 5.1) at least a complete live performance from 73, warts and all, could have been considered. Packaging was OK but overpriced considering the Floyd immersion sets are a little nicer and much cheaper. 2 stars for the music, but could easily have been 4 if more considerate."
5,The Who's Masterpiece,"The concept album reached new heights with Quadrophenia. Pity our poor hero, from a dysfunctional home and trying to get a grip on life. Living in the time of mods and rockers, his life is filled with what he perceives as trials and tribulations until he reaches an understanding (of a sort) of who he is. Representing the four members of The Who, the young man becomes an embodiment of what the band is, at least through the eyes of Townshend, the sole author of this piece. Easier to follow than Tommy, Quadrophenia is a fully realized classic with great performances and incredibly powerful songs. Along with Who's Next, this is the must have Who CD."
2,Lacking Value for the $$$,"I would have bought this set in a second if it had included a full version of the album in 5.1. Absent that, or a live version/full concert from the period, the box set just doesn't compute. Too bad."
1,This is NOT the original recording!!! It's lost it's edge!!!,"If this is the same recording as being sold online, it is no where near the original. If you could somehow remaster something for ""political correctness"" this is what you would get. The original Quadrophenia was a reflection of an age in turmoil. Where drugs,death were common and young people questioned those in authority and their values. This ""remaster"" has removed the artists original with sanitized copy. If you ever heard Quadrophenia on vinal, this isn't even close. What has been done in remastering is akin to letting a four year old mark up one of the ""masters"" paintings with colored markers. So sad."
2,one of the most overrated albums in the history of rock and roll!,"Let me begin by stating that I LOVE THE WHO! However Im just going to call it like it is and say that this is without a doubt one of the most overrated albums of all time. The first album I heard by this band was Whos next followed by Tommy, so when I heard about this double album I was beyond excited. coming after those to amazing records this was a huge letdown. First off all the songs sound so damn similar (wich would be ok if that song was great) but thats not the case here. With the exception of Love reign oer me the album is overblown, irritating , redundant, and a challenge to sit through. There I said it."
1,"304 ""reviews"" and NOT ONE HAS TO DO WITH WHAT THE ACTUAL PRODUCT IS..... THE VINYL EDITION.","304 ""reviews"" and NOT ONE HAS TO DO WITH WHAT THE ACTUAL PRODUCT IS..... THE VINYL EDITION."
2,great?,"I keep listening to these cds hoping that their ""greatness"" will somehow come shining through. I feel nothing and think that it is just some lame attmept at making Pete Townshend look artistic."
3,...Get outta my face!,"I fail to find what's so great about this CD. Some of the songs are good, some are not. That's it. There's more bad songs than good ones. And the one which was really good, Helpless Dancer, is also really short. With all due respect to The Who, Quadrophenia is definitely - I mean, DEFINITELY - not worth [the price]...The little story in the booklet is pretty cool, though. I like when the narrator says, ""I'm not schizophrenic! I'm bleeding quadrophenic!"" Heh-heh, I got a good laugh at that one.But still! - ye readers of this review, hark! Do not buy Quadrophenia! You will regret it for the rest of your days - and, believe me, your days will be long."
1,Husband hates it,Bought this for my husband for Christmas because he loves 'Who Are You' and other Who songs. He said it is the worst cd. So it was kind of a waste for us.
3,"Remastered and Ruined, This masterpiece deserved better !","I have a number of the songs on this cd on both LP and original ""un-remastered"" CD collections. Why do record companies insist on adding echo and ruining the original mix. Really a tragedy that this CD is so muddy. Mine is going into the trade-in bin at the record store. Such great music, too ! A crying shame."
3,Good Moments But Go With The Original,"I bought this record back in the early eighties. There are several great songs(Dr. Jimmy, The Real Me, The Punk And The Godfather, 5:15). I also enjoy several of the songs contributed by other artists such as She's So Fine, Da Do Run Run, and Be My Baby.However the new who tracks Four Faces, Joker James, and Get Out And Stay Out are inferior additions when they replace missing tracks like Cut My Hair, Drowned, The Rock, and The Dirty Jobs. Also cutting only 34 seconds of Helpless Dancer is oh so annoying. What is the point please?If you like the early sixties at the end of the CD, you might want to pick this version up. Otherwise go with the all Who Quadrophenia."
5,Review of The Who Quadrophenia album,I won't go on and on about the quality of this album. It has spoken for itself over the decades. One of my first two albums I ever had in my life when I came of age to want a specific type of music for true enjoyment as opposed to just a passing popular fad or just to have some noise in the background. The first one I had was on an 8 track!!! I then proceeded to get it on vinyl and then on cassette....and now on CD. I will NEVER get tired of listening to this fantastic album.
5,Masterpiece!,"To any who inquire (no pun intended), this is quintessential Who! Who's Next is timeless, Who By Numbers is timeless, Live at Leed's may be THE best Live album EVER, but Quadrophenia is THE absolutely required Who audio experience. All of the aggressiveness, raw energy, spirited composing, and flawless execution is evident in the genius of Pete Townshend on this effort (notice how i twice resisted the use of ALBUM as not to show my age?).I know that this is completely a puff for the Who, but i've owned this album as a double album, a cassette and the remastered version on CD, and the sound is absolutely incredible, the songs written in 1972-3 still stand (as does everything from Live at Leeds on) and sound timeless, like they could have been recorded yesterday (or today).Buy it, you won't be sorry, and if you are, listen to it again..."
1,TOTAL RIP-OFF!!!,"Anyone who likes the ORIGINAL mixes, DO NOT get this, I repeat, DO NOT get this Deluxe or the Super Deluxe EDitions. The demos are, well, unrelease, so who knows if they're the original mixes, but the 1973 Quadrophenia mixes are not original, they used the 1996 masters. I guess that's what fans of the original masters call HOPELESS after finding out that the 1996 masters are on here instead... If you have money to waste on this, go right ahead, but if you like the original masters and if you have a little more on your budget, try purchasing the Gold CD that was released in 1991. Only 1 star for the demos, but that's it."
2,It's OK,"I thought it was the entire album. It contains highlights and a bunch of other tracks from the movie, (Movie? What movie?) Save your money and listen to the Quadrophenia album on YouTube."
5,The Who's Greatest Work,From its stunning classical background music to the riviting lyrics this is without question one of the greatest albums of all time.
5,Another Brilliant Album,"Pete Townshend once introduced Quadrophenia as ""not just a looking back, but a bringing-up-to-date; Quadrophenia is about where we're all at today."" He wasn't referring just to the band. More than any other album, Quadrophenia is demanding, drawing the listener into its milieu. You don't have to be a Mod in 1960s London to appreciate it; Quadrophenia's themes of angst and alienation are universal, and its protagonist, Jimmy, is reflected in the eyes of every teenager in every decade."
2,"No live set, same '96 mix=ripoff","The best reissues---Pavement, REM come to mind--offer a remaster of the original album, b-sides, unused tracks, and a live set from the era. If any record deserves this, it's 'Quadrophenia'. The band was at its live peak. There's no official Who live album between 'Live at Leeds' and the horrorshow of 'Who's Last', so a Quad tour set would have helped the band's diminishing legacy, and made this box set worth it. The demos are good, but some have seen release on 'Scoop' and soundtrack albums. There's no unreleased full band track, no live set, no remaster. Who's running The Who's release projects and legacy? Even Courtney Love would do a better job."
4,A Classic Rock Album,"Although ""Quadrophenia"" is Pete Townshend's most ambitious and grandiose project, it's also The Who's last truly great album. The band's performance is first-rate though the album does tend to suffer from a bad case of overproduction at times. This is particularly evident on the instrumental interludes ""Quadrophenia"" and ""The Rock."" Still, that doesn't detract from the potency of these or any of the other cuts on the album.Despite its complexity, ""Quadrophenia"" flows well. The music and the lyrics are strong and the marriage of synthesizers and sound effects help make for a unique and timeless listening experience. Without a doubt, ""Quadrophenia"" is an innovative concept album that deserves the attention of all Who fans."
1,Horrible mix,"I grew up with the 1973 original of this, on Track Records. This new mix is horrendous, somehow emphasizing the faults of the original, ie the lows and bass is way too much in front, the rest is a muddy background. The label is Polydor and the records feel very heavy and well made. The sleeves are audiophile quality. But then the bad stuff...the album jacket and the booklet are substandard reproductions with lots of tiny dots in them...and for some silly reason they glued the booklet into the inside cover! And there is no voucher for a mp3...AVOID THIS!"
1,An Ep For 5.1 !!!!!,"This is why I Did not buy this set. An 8 Track of 5.1 songs . Hello Pete or Roger , in case you've forgotten this is a story lp with all songs conected. If nothing would have been released it would have been better.Now there is no hope I or anyone else will see the full version released in 5.1. What a shame!!!!!"
4,QUAD SONGS FROM THE SOUNDTRACK,"Yeah great sound on all these tracks.Its a shame the whole album ain't here,I mean the whole regular album of course.It seems tempting to me to hear beefed up versions of other songs from the original WHO album,like CUT MY HAIR and QUADROPHENIA would have been nice or even the ROCK would have been cool.I must say I don't miss the rest of the movie soundtrack songs by the other artist that where left out with the exception of HI HEELED SNEAKERS by whoever I don't remember. But JOHN'S bass just rock's out on all of these tracks.He will be sorely missed if the band decides to tour again.Losing KIETH was one thing and still calling it THE WHO,but losing JOHN is quite another thing.Well that said this disc has other WHO songs that at the time of release where unheard of(GET OUT AND STAY OUT,JOKER JAMES,AND FOUR FACES)all work well.And of course the 2 openers which date back to the high numbers era are always a blast too.To sum it up THE WHO are the greatest,enjoy"
4,Pretty good!,"I had gotton into The Who and there Rock Opera's after seeing ""Tommy"" on AMC. I bought the soundtrack for Quadrophenia without hearing the original or seeing the movie. The tracks are not as good as Tommy but still good on its own. Among the good tracks are ""The Real Me"" ""Bellboy"" ""Get Out Stay Out"" and ""Joker James"". There are some classic rock albums on the album which are good but don't fit with the Who songs. This is and will always be one of my favorite albums."
1,Townshend's deaf...And he proves it!,"SAME bad remix as the 1996 remaster...Hey Pete....Don't you have enough money? This was supposed to be the remix and remaster of the VINYL mixes! Not so. Same compresssed over the top '96 mix we all know and hate.The MFSL gold CD (long out of print) is the only way to go, fellow Who fans."
5,10 Stars,"Quadrophenia is quite simply my favorite musical experience of all time.I'm not sure it would be possible to create a better overall Rock Music experience. A virtual masterpiece from start to finish.Any self respecting Pharoah would make damn sure to have his cd player and a copy of Quadrophenia buried with him in his tomb beneath the Pyramid.Not just 5 stars, but a full 10 STAR Masterpiece!"
1,Way overpriced! Not Amazon's fault!,"contains four CDs, a DVD and a vinyl seven inch single. This box set gives a unique insight into the creation of this landmark album and features a remaster of the original double album, Pete Townshend's previously unheard demos including songs that didn't make it onto the original album, an exclusive eight track 5.1 sound DVD, a deluxe hard-back book, previously unseen personal notes, photographs, memorabilia and other exclusive material.Is this really worth to pay $126.00 and more to get the above? NO, I am so glad Ihave the Mobile Fidelity version which uses a first generation tape from Pete Townsend own collection.If you think it's worth it, you must be a real die hard Who fanGive us the music not all these little trinkets, they said only eight of the songs were available for the 5.1 sound, sad."
2,Sound quality not up to expectations,"The sound quality of this sacd is well below par. It lacks presence. It is no better than the original 16 bit cd. This could have been much better. The producer chose not to mix it in 5.1, but mixed it in stereo instead. Who makes these decisions?"
5,The best eletronic that I know,"If you like a eletronic music, with quality, and can leave you to the other place, do not lost this cd. Is the best of J M Jarre without doubt."
5,I love this CD!!,Best indie CD I've heard in a long time. And catch their live show! I hate when bands are awful live and their CDs are overproduced-- this is not at all the case with White Rabbits.
2,Love or Hate???,"Once I started watching this movie, I could not stop. Not due to the fact that it was great cinema, but rather because it was so terribly awful! Very campy and incredibly crude at times, this is a cult classic that I am glad to have in my collection. That being said, I think it will be a long time before I sit down to watch it again."
1,What is this?,"Undoubtedly the single most disturbing and most pointless movie I have ever laid my eyes upon. I honestly do not know who on this planet in the right mind would actually enjoy such a horrible movie. This movie is unquestionably for the clinically insane, and even then I doubt it would be appealing to anyone. No clue how this has all of the 5 star reviews, these people are either Crazy or possibly Sadistic. Completely Disturbing/Pointless."
1,OVERRATED,"""This one made me grab the nearest razor blades and scrape away at my wrists to get away from the horror that is this film. Only great thing is the Danny Elfman/Oingo Boingo music and Susan Tyrell.""Bizarre and Weird but not in a good way. Only watch if your Stoned or on Acid"
5,"Wild, comedic fun","A musical [recently released in color!] by Richard and Danny Elfman of The Mystic Knights of Oingo Boingo. Wonderful animation sequences that further remove you from reality into The Forbidden Zone! The commentary reveals interesting trivia; they seemed to have a lot of fun making the movie. I don't usually value extras, as the movie itself is my focus. You might compare dvd releases to see which extras you'd find more valuable. The new color release is enticing."
3,Worth Watching,I would recommend this to anyone who likes movies that are a little out of the ordinary. It is pretty much hit or miss.
2,The Forbidden Zone,"A friend recommended this movie to me because I am an Oingo Boingo fan. Let me tell you, ""It is really out there!!!"" I am really glad that Danny Elfman kept up the music side of his career. The movie probably has lots of fans, but I found it really silly."
5,FORBIDDEN ZONE,"This movie is not for everyone, those easily offended or that do not have a sense of humor stay clear. If you can appreciate something a little south of normal, you will love this movie. Great music, bizzare images, and a great plot. This will appeal to the weirdo in everyone."
2,Don't replace it - strap it,"The hold down latch on my charger broke, and after reading the experiences of other people, I decided not to replace my charger. Instead, I made a strap out of two 1/4 inch wide tie wraps to see if strapping the top plunger down would work. The strap worked perfectly. I then made a more permanent strap out of narrow nylon strapping. Simply hold the plunger down, slip the strap around the whole unit, and clean and charge the shaver. This is a cheap and simple fix that works."
2,Why so hard to find?,"Ditto on the lock down mechanism. That's why I'm buying this. In fact, I had trouble finding where to buy this. If it is indeed NOT built to last, this base unit should be more readily available.In trying to get the original one to work again, I believe I freed a spring that was malfunctioning, preventing the arm to stay locked down. I can use the original still for cleaning, manually pulling the arm out of the razor end, but I somehow also broke the connection which allows the razor to recharge while connected so here I am buying a new base.If you're reading this, you probably already have this razor, your base broke, and you're looking for a replacement so none of this should sound unfamiliar to you. What I would recommend is bookmarking this page because a year or so from now, if still using the razor, you'll probably have to order this again because it's definitely not built to last."
3,Works well but not durable,"This device works well for cleaning, but I had to buy this replacement because the ""click-down"" stopped locking in place."
1,Cleaning Base not Worth the Price,"As others have written, I have now had my cleaning base break three (3) times. The first two times were under warranty, and I ""only"" had to pay an extra $10 each time to have it shipped to a repair facility. The third time is out of warranty, and Braun Customer Service is telling me they are unwilling to do anything for me. Very disappointing for a Braun product that obviously has a design flaw. You won't find me buying a replacement for a product manufactured poorly."
4,Excellent for cleaning Shaver,"Like the previous reviewer, I am looking at this replacement because the top mechanism that locks down to hold, charge, and control the shaver during the clean cycle stopped locking down. This happened after 2.5 years of use, which I still consider too short a lifespan for a product at this price point, but is pretty good in the disposable world we seem to live in now.Functionally, this product works exceptionally. Three months after I received this as a gift, I took a long term project away from home and did not bring the base. After six months of manual cleaning, I was replacing the blades. That second blade set, with daily use of this base, lasted me nearly 16 months, or nearly 80% longer. That alone paid for the price of this cleaner over its lifetime."
1,ALERT: D E F E C T I V E P R O D U C T,"The Braun 7000 shaver is a great shaver, however the clean & charge base unit is defective as you can see from all the reviews.Like everyone else, the base unit spring mechanism stopped functioning after 2 months which left me jury-rigging an elastic band around the unit to hold the spring mechanism down.Save your money and use a spray-on foil cleaner if it breaks and don't buy one even if you feel lucky...well do you?"
4,Helps get that close smooth shave every time.,"I bought this as a replacement for my previous charger base. I accidentally dropped the base from about 4 feet and it would no longer stay closed. The base does exactly as advertised. It cleans your electric razor to a near new shine. The only thing I don't like is the power cord. The power cord is elastic-like and you really can't hide it very well because of that fact. Also, it would have been great if the end of the power cord was at a 90 degree angle. It sticks out a little over an inch and is really an eyesore."
2,"ditto, ditto, ditto","Too bad Braun hasn't fixed this issue. Product works well and keeps my razor fresh, but I am in process of ordering my third unit, due to the same issue with the lock down feature. Seems to last about 2 plus years."
3,Third Time is the Charm?,"This is the third base that I have bought for this razor. I love the product, I just hope the latch on this one doesn't fail like the other ones!!"
2,Braun Syncro 7000 series clean & Charge base,"It is very unclear from reading the product description that the cleaner cartridge is NOT included with the base. The cartridge must be ordered separately at an additional cost of close to $12. This seems pretty high considering the base itself is almost $50.Worst part is, no prompt comes up saying that the cleaner cartridge is a product to be purchased at this time. So you get the $50 unit, open it, see a gaping hole in the bottom and then have to figure out if the cleaner cartridge was just not included by error or to be purchased separately.$50 for just the base, although it works, is not good value because it cannot ""clean"" as the title infers."
4,Product matched picture,"Just wanted to add a quick note to clarify description, you only get one of these even though the product description states ""packed 10 per carton""."
2,Great until they break,"I've had about 6 pairs of these over-glasses sunglasses. On each pair, after about 6 months to a year or so, one or the other of the temple (over the ear) pieces breaks (usually the left side) and cannot be repaired or replaced, so a new pair must be purchased. The temples are obviously manufactured to be fragile and break after slight use or exposure to sunlight UV rays. I am sick of planned obsolescence. We are making China rich and sending tons of junk to the landfills."
4,Good Price,"My eye doctor was selling this product at $35, so buying through Amazon was a huge savings. They are a good fit over glasses. The only detractor statement that I can make is side vision is somewhat blind and, if mishandled, they scratch easily."
1,why did I buy this?,"Read a lot of reviews saying that this supplement can help induce lucid-dreaming. Took as directed, and guess what? Nothing happened. No Lucid Dreams, and actually had a far worse time just remembering my dreams. At least no side effects... Total waste of Money."
3,Thank god for the 1 player mode,"One cowboy on the left, one cowboy on the right. In the middle? You choose, based on the game variation. Sometimes it's a cactus, sometimes it's a stagecoach...and even sometimes it's a wall you must shoot through to get to your opponent. The game is a lot of fun. Don't worry though if you have a kid who falls madly in love with it it does have a 1 player mode. It's a moving target, which moves up and down (no intelligent computer control), that can be shot at. It's way too easy to hit your opponent but it's also way to easy to have limited amounts of fun."
3,Good but not like pictured,"This is a great functioning clock radio. It has all the features listed and the projection is really wild! I can't believe it has the temperature sensor included at that price. BUT, beware...the display is NOT like that which is pictured. It is not LED with black background. It is an all blue lighted background which is very bright at night. I have to turn the clock around at night or it's just too bright. It has an adjustable auto dimmer but it is still way to bright at night. I guess I just don't like nightlites or anything, so if this is not an issue for you it may be OK. Another important thing to note though, you can only read this clock at eye level. If you place your clock on a shelf a foot or more above you in bed you won't be able to read it unless you are looking at it straight on. Kinda weird, but the display is just the Blue color unless you look at it straight on. It's probably the same if you place it lower than you are but I haven't tested that."
2,Poor Disply Kills the deal,Great clock upon first glance. Loved the wall/ceiling display and digital tuning of radio stations. what i CAN NOT STAND is the ridiculous blue display. DOES NOT LOOK LIKE PICTURE. not only is this thing bright as can be (will light your whole bedroom)....but it has the most RIDICULOUSLY SMALL VIEWING ANGLE of any clock i have ever seen. if it is even a few inches higher or lower than your viewing angle you WILL NOT SEE THE TIME!! How RCA missed this is beyond me. your much better off skipping the projection feature and going with the other displays. stay away from the blue if you like seeing your clock radio's time
3,Basic alarm clock with moderately useful projector,"It's a pretty standard alarm clock, which I got mainly for the projector. However, it's not particularly bright, so you can only really see it at night. If you hit a button, then it brightens up a bit temporarily, but then that kinda defeats the purpose. Also, it can be kind of hard to find a good position to place/point the projector. Otherwise, it works pretty much fine as an alarm clock, though I don't use too many of the other features.Note: The picture doesn't show it quite right. The entire screen lights up blue and the numbers are in black (not black background with blue lit numbers). I would prefer it how it is in the picture, but that's not the case."
3,"Bright, BRIGHT display","We bought this clock for my husbands side of the bed. He loves the projection button that shows the time on the ceiling and the temperature display. However, the main display is sooo bright and there is no way to dim it. It lit our room. We finally used a piece of lighting gel from a theatre friend to filter the light. If you are afraid of the dark, this clock will be perfect for you!"
3,The Good and The Bad,"I've had this for a few months and there's no surprises if you read all the reviews here.* Selectable snooze duration* Gradually increasing alarm level* Reasonably pleasant alarm sound* Decent range on outdoor weather sensor* Projection is plenty bright, big, clear enough at night, but washed out during the day.* It's not a blue-on-black LED display as pictured. It's a black-on-blue LCD display.* The display backlight is bright. It has a light sensor to dim it, but it's still brighter than I'd like.* If the clock's at or above eye level, you cannot read the LCD screen. If it's below eye level you can read it. It needs some sort of contrast or viewing angle adjustment."
5,This is what music should be!!,"I had always admired Peter Garrett for walking away from the security of a law firm to follow his heart. Until this record, I had found them very good, but at the time, thought U2 was so much better. This record changed my mind. This is the best album that I bought in the late 80's. It is full of passion, anger, angst, and wonderfully crafted musical hooks. This is what all people should strive to accomplish at least once in their lives---- incorporate a deeply rooted set of beliefs into a work of art. Looking back at this album ten years later, it has lost none of it's value. BUY THE DAMN THING ALREADY!!!!!"
4,The right soul of Australia...,"Like many people in France and worldwide, I discovered Midnight Oil through this FM-band killer released in 1987.""Beds are burning"" and ""The Dead Heart"" became instant classics, the other highlights including the catchies ""Dreamworld"" and ""Sometimes"" as well as the atmospheric ""Put down that weapon"" (my personal favorite!).You can still hear some of these tunes on the radio today...With its fine instrumental arrangements (electric & acoustic guitars, harmonicas...), intelligent and committed lyrics, ""Diesel and Dust"" established the Oil's as one of the most popular band of that time, although it sold few copies compared to its Aussies counterparts AC/DC and INXS...Yet it revealed a talented and charismatic frontman: Peter Garrett. With an incredible presence and his cutting voice, this last brings an awesome punk/heavy-metal touch to the songwriting!Included in the great Oil's period (1982-90), this album is on my mind one of their best release at that day!"
3,"""Beta"" Version of ""Blue Sky Mining""","""Diesel and Dust"" is an enjoyable album but it comes across as a collection of B-Sides when compared to ""Blue Sky Mining."" The song-writing, lyrics and atmosphere of Blue Sky are a step above Diesel. In fact, in comparing the two albums, a song-by song comparison arose in my mind. I won't bore the reader by going track-by track, but just as an example, Blue Sky Mining is a much better opener than Beds are Burning. Never liked that song much. Antarctica is a MUCH better song than Arcticworld. Forgotten Years is better than, well, just about anything on Diesel. I even love Mountains of Burma. Perhaps some individuals have put the hype for Diesel into overdrive? Blue Sky gets the 5 stars over Diesel."
3,Disc Jockey Review W807 Radio AM Bridgeport/Chicago,"The Album has one five star song ""burning beds"" and is worth the price two other songs would rate a four, I do not remember titles, But diersel in the dust is different than many bands , but has the qualities that helped other bands like Tears for fears has or even a little like the DuranDuran, but more classic horn & bass to it.Three and a half stars.I guess to rate higher another song like the first cut was needed to make the album a bit better. True five star albums would be as example: Pink Floyd The wall,or Taking Back Sunday Where you want to be, or going for sountracks?,: Lost Highway is a top mix with all types of music, incl 9inch nails."
5,OUTSTANDING,I am a long time fan of Midnight Oil. This is the Album that made them popular to the General public. Diesel & Dust is to Midnight Oil like Throwing Copper is to Live or Ten is to Pearl Jam. It is a must have for your music collection!
5,Bullroarer,"Great album. See others for more detailed reviews. But for the people that don't know what the sound is on ""Bullroarer"" (it is not a slowed down helicopter blade!), the sound is a .... Bullroarer! It is an aboriginal ""musical instrument"" used in some holy ceremonies. It is a flat piece of wood with a string tied to it and swung around the head."
5,perfect,"This book the moon below was a wonderful book it show how in the ""old"" day's a younge girl could still be indepent and stong and help other women to become stonge and also indepent this book show's younge women how to be stonge and incourage women to stand up and tall and never give up thank u bye"
2,Not happy with purchase.,This can opener is hard to use. The first time I used it I was not impressed with the opener. I would not recommend this opener.
3,Not the best one out there,"I ordered this can opener and at the same time I ordered the ""Oxo Good Grips Smooth Edge Can Opener"" - did this to compare items side-by-side. The Kuhn Rikon took some learning - after we figured it out it does, indeed, take the lid off a can very neatly just as promised. The angle of the knob is not nearly as comfortable or as easy to operate as the Oxo model. I returned the Kuhn Rikon and kept the Oxo."
3,Really for professional portrait photographers,"This book really addresses the professional portrait photographer and how he or she should run their portrait studio. Photography techniques are glossed over on the assumption that you are familiar with the basics. Customer relationships, on the other hand, receives considerable attention from the author."
4,great tips on photography.,"the book talks about different aspects of portrait photography from client approach, to posing, to technical aspectsto wedding photography, to locations, and to marketing. highly recommended."
3,oldie but good general info,"This book is an oldie, back in the film days, but has a lot of good general information. It covers a wide variety of topics such as which format of camera should you choose, basic business practices, how to present your finished products, and covering portraits and weddings- from the business perspective. There is a lot of information regarding various lighting technigues, equipment, etc. There is very little information on posing, and the photos are very dated. It is correctly sub-titled, ""professional techniques and practices in portrait photography"". It has lots of business related practical info that would probably benefit someone new to the busines."
3,Good.,"Juliet may have dreams of adventure in the land of the Pharoh's, but as a woman in the nineteenth century, she knows all that they are is dreams that she can barely admit to herself. Studying her father's finds will have to do, or so she believes until Morgan Beauchamp comes with a new shipment of treasure. The dashing rouge who is helping her catalog makes her heart race, then adventure does when pieces start to vanish and ancient spirits apparently begin haunting her home. A curse seems to be active, or is it?*** Imagine a Regency set Indiana Jones or Lara Croft, and you have some idea of what to expect- a comedy of manners with a bit of romance and action. Given the epilouge, fans might hope for more adventures in the series. ***Amanda"
5,Cutting through implausable concepts...,This excellent book deals with strategic IT topics and managerial & organisational complexities associated with making the best out of IT investments. Academic concepts frequently impossible to make use of are criticised and put in a context that makes deep sense both for academics and business men.We use the business model construct in capex discussions and for personnel training.
5,This is an amazing Jelly Bean,"I have met the creator/inventor of the Jelly Belly and I can report with full confidence, that this is one tasty Licorice Jelly Bean. A Jelly Belly is smaller than Jelly Beans and that is why Ronald Reagan liked them so much. My personal favorite flavor is Licorice. 5 STARS!"
4,Great Jelly Bean,"Just like all Jelly Belly's I've tried, the flavor is very accurate. The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I like my licorice stronger."
1,Disappointment,"The artists are trying their best, but loose out hopelessly. This is a live recording by the Boston Opera Company - and much too live it is. I have never heard so much coughing and other audience noise on any recording. At times it is even evident that some members of the audience are having conversations. And then American audiences are so ill bred. They never wait for the music to finish before they start applauding, drowning out completely the last minute. To top it all the recording engineer seems to love applause, because he never fades it out, but keeps recording until it dies down by itself. As if the listener would be more fascinated by applause than by the music itself.My advice to prospective buyers is to stay away from this one. I am going to take my copy to the dump site and I will buy another, definitely non-live edition of Semiramide"
3,"Not great, but not that bad either","This book continues the story of Makepeace Burke and her family as the Revolutionary War begins. Her daughter is missing off a ship headed back to England and her journey to find Phillippa ends up dragging her into treatment of the American prisoners and smuggling. I'm in agreement with another reviewer, it took at least 300 pages to get things cooking, and with a 450 page book that's way too long for me. I also felt there were too many secondary characters, I had a hard time keeping track of some of the villagers. And while I enjoyed the snappy dialogue between Makepeace and Diana, to me it felt that it sounded a bit more 20th century than 18th century.I did finish it, but not one I'm likely to pick up again, nor search out other books by this author. If you are dead set on continuing Makepeace's story, get it from the library first. Then if you love it, buy it."
4,A Chance to Travel Back in Time.,"I loved this book and cried when it was over. Makepeace and Diana are two forces to be reckoned with. I loved the idea of strong women on the brink of war in a time where women were expected to keep quiet. This book reminds me a little of Frenchman's Creek, but it was so wonderful. You must read it. It is awesome."
2,Didn't grab me,I finally gave up half way through the book. Didn't find the characters particularly interesting and the plot was too predictable.
1,Save Your Money!!!,"Horrible production values, if this is an indication of how they D.J., they're gonna starve. Let's start with the CHEESEY music, which, under normal circumstances, would be in the BACKGROUND. Instead it is so LOUD and OVERBEARING I cannot hear anything being said as far as the supposed instruction is concerned. In addition, the first half-hour or so is some kind of infomercial for an online DJ mgt company, (I assume this to be the case, but as I stated before, I CAN'T HEAR ANYTHING BUT THE CHEESEY MUSIC!!!!). Don't waste your time on this product. There is apparently no way to get a refund for money badly spent, so let my loss be a warning to you. DON'T BUY THIS DVD!!!!"
1,Dissapointed with this book...,"I have three other books from this series and have read them all to my primary school students (1st-3rd grade). This book, however, was not appropriate for that age group, and was a terrible purchase. The story was too long and confusing, too much information that was not written in a manner that was interesting for children, it talked about how he spent time in jail, how he lied, how he knew it didnt matter if he payed attention and did well in math and science because all he wanted to do was be an artist... nice message!"
5,Lost,The book has a very good story line. It never gives you a place to stop. Each page and each chapter will pull you to the next.Suspense is there from beginning until the end. Each scene plays out well.
4,"""Lost"" Found Me","From the first page I was hooked! Helen Myers has written this book in a way that flows several characters in one suspensful plot. She even had time to throw in a steamy romance between a hard core virgin and a ""by the book"" town sheriff.I haven't picked up a book in a long time, but when I recieved this book as a gift I couldn't put it down. I highly recommend you read this book."
1,Not good on returns,"Know what you want, if you need a return you'll have to send 2nd and 3rdrequest for authorization"
1,Junk,"The construction was of very cheap plastic, the casing would crack open the the bottom base twiseted a certain way.As a router it barley worked, then it wouldn't let me log in or change any settings. The company tech support was frendly but were not able to fix my problem.Waste of my money"
5,"Easy, Breezy!","Great for little ones. Teaching money concepts? Make this your choice. Included collection for the kids. Pictures are large, text simple & to the point. Reluctant readers will find this particularly appealing."
2,Works fine but maps are stale,"The software on this device is fairly well written, and it works fine, but there are two glaring problems: The maps haven't been updated since 2007, and the unit sometimes doesn't find the satellites unless it is turned off and back on. Other than that it works well and its never gotten me lost.The other minor annoyance is that you can't zoom out beyond the 10 mile scale on the map."
4,Fun Workout,"I like many of Jillian Michaels' workout tapes. This one is fun to do, and different, which helps if your motivation is lagging. I agree with some of the earlier reviews that there are some problems--she doesn't equally work each side, there are mistakes shown where the model is using the wrong leg when kicking (fixed several frames later), and the choreography is a little tricky at first. Jillian insists that you pivot and get set in an awkward manner before one kicking sequence. I am on carpet and just ignored that. Overall, though, if you tweak a few things this is a fine workout. You can do all three segments at once (about 60 minutes), but I do Segment 1 and 2 one day, and Segment 2 and 3 next time, then 3 and 1 for a 40 minute workout. Just doing one segment is really too short unless you are supplementing with other exercise. Glad I bought this."
4,A Little Complicated,"I have all of Jillian's workout DVDs and I love every last one of them, so of course I had to get this one too. I liked the workout. The only complaint I have is that some of the foot work/punching sets get a little long and complicated (jab, cross, hook, uppercut, hook again, front kick, back kick, etc). I ended up changing it up slightly just to be able to keep up with the speed. I'd rather do that than stand there confused trying to figure it out.To give you an idea of how much of a workout it is, I did the first two workouts together back to back for a total of 40 minutes. I'm a 115 lb woman and per my heart rate monitor I burned 545 calories."
4,Its great - almost as good as Sugar Rays VHS!,"I love aerobics and Jillian's DVD didn't disappoint. Since Sugar Ray put his VHS out many moons ago I've struggled to find an Aerobics workout I enjoy - now I have. So unless you're lucky enough to track down Sugars VHS, give this a go."
4,jm kickbox fast fix,"i like the workout because its an overall total body workout; however, what i don't like at all is how jillian does not switch sides for all exercises. just because she is right handed doesn't mean we all are."
3,Not as good as JM's other videos,"In my opinion, this is not as good as the other Jillian Michaels videos that are available online. Yes she gets you moving. Yes you will probably be sweating at the end. But, the frenetic pace of the workout is daunting if you don't know the moves already. Most of the time, I could not figure out the combinations of the footwork fast enough to do the exercise with the group. I think it would be really easy to hurt myself trying to do some of these moves without instruction. There is a tutorial at the end of the video that walks you through all the moves step by step, but I at least went into this expecting the training Michaels provides in her other videos. Also, there really isn't a warm-up. In the future, I think I will run through some warm-up exercises from 30-Day Shred or the like before starting one of these workouts. I will be trying this workout again, but I am disappointed in it right now."
4,Fast and Effective,"Another solid workout from Jillian! I love this DVD because you can choose to do just one 20-minute routine or you can push yourself and do 2 routines or even all three for an hour long sweat-fest! The first time I did this routine I found it to be a little on the easier side (I am not new to working out- I workout 5-6 days/week and am an avid long-distance runner). However, I have grown to really enjoy this workout when I push myself to my limits. If you really give it your all, then you will be drenched in just 20 minutes. However, if you half-ass it like I did the first time and just kind of throw your arm out there for the punches (those of you who kick-box know what I'm talking about), then you probably won't get results from this DVD. Put some power into these moves and you'll do great!"
5,Love it!,"Jillian gives you exactly what you expect in this workout video, sweat. I would recommend this DVD to any person looking for a good kickbox video at home."
2,Not typical of Jillian,"I really wanted to like this DVD and was so excited to get it, as I'm a huge Jillian fan who has all of her workout videos. Not the case with this one. It's extremely difficult to pick up the steps even after going through the tutorial. It's like learning dance moves. I gave it a few trys before I gave up and returned it. I spent so much time fumbling over my feet trying to get the correct tap here and a step there that I didn't focus on my workout and burning calories. It's also not as hard and rigorous as her other DVDs. Each level only burns about 150 calories. She only works one side of your body for most of these workouts which seemed odd to me, always starting and using the same side/same leg for every circuit. If you're not an experienced kickboxer or you want a cardio thumping workout do not buy this. Get her Banish Fat Boost Metabolism, 30 Day Shred, or Ripped in 30. It seems like she made this way more intricate than it had to be as far as the steps go."
3,Ok,"I am surprised how great the reviews are for this dvd. I have all of Jillian's DVDs and I have always loved them. This one, not so much. The workouts are too short. 20 min just isn't enough. It isn't at all like 30 Day Shred where you can work out for 20-30 min and feel like you worked out. On this DVD I find I have to do all three workouts together. If you do that, than yes, it is a good DVD. But there isn't an option to play all three in a row. You have press one, do the whole thing, wait for the DVD to reset and then press the next one. It is annoying. I liked how in Shed and Shred you can play both workouts without having to go back to the main menu. In all I will use it as one workout but it isn't what I expected. This is the first Jillian product I have ever been disappointed in. Maybe if you are more beginner than this would be a good DVD to start with. Still love her other DVDs though and will still continue to be a huge Jillian Michaels fan."
3,Good video but.....,"I just did this dvd for the first time this morning and I am a big fan of Jillian Michaels, I am currently doing 90 day body revolution for the second time and bought this to mix up my cardio. It is a really good workout I did 1 and 3 and I sweated my butt off! My big problem with this workout is that on MOST exercises she only works 1 side of the body! I am very shocked that this dvd even went out for purchase, BUT I am giving it 3 stars because it is a good workout and if you know anything about working out you just modify and switch sides on the second circuit."
2,NOT AS GOOD AS 30-DAY SHRED or KETTLEBELL DVD,"This DVD did make me sweat and was fast-paced, but was not as good as other Jillian Michaels' workout DVDs. Some of the combinations were complicated and so fast that it was hard to get a hang of them; I am sure this would get easier in time but was frustrating on the first time trying the workout. My main complaint is that she only works one side of the body. Jillian starts all her moves on the left leg throughout all three workouts. She doesn't reverse the move to start with the right leg. So if you want a balanced workout you need to remember to alternate legs yourself OR redo each workout using the other side of the body. This is a pain when you have some complicated combos that take concentration and then you are trying to reverse them. I do not like this video as much as the 30-Day Shred or her kettle bell workout. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS VIDEO."
4,Good workout,"Having a martial arts background, I did enjoy this workout. I do 2 or 3 levels at a time for a longer workout, but one level at a time would be great if you have time constraints."
4,"Super fast, moderately intense workout","I like the Jillian Michaels 20 minute workout series and use them a lot. With this one, you just jump right into each one, no warmup for any of them, which I found I needed to stop and warm up myself beforehand - that part is a little strange. But, they are no more than 20 minutes a piece, so nice for a weeknight workout when in a timecrunch. I found with each level, the first time I did them I didn't get much of a workout because I spent so much time trying to figure out the complicated moves. But, with a couple of tries, I got the hang of it and the workouts are much more effective now. It makes me feel better that even some of the girls in the video don't seem to be able to figure out some of the moves. :)"
5,Great Cardio!,"I love all things Jillian, and this dvd is no exception. At first I did feel hopelessly uncoordinated, but the more you do it the easier it gets. I try to do it as a bonus cardio, or level 1 & 2 together, but really just the 20 minutes is enough to make me drip with sweat. Great workout!"
2,The worst Jillian DVD,"I LOVE Jillian Michaels and I own at least 10 of her DVD's. This one was a real disappointment. Each of the 3 kickboxing workouts is only 20 minutes (they are advertised as 30 min.) 20 minutes would be fone except they aren't challenging at all. Her 30-day shred is also 20 minutes but it kicks my butt and leaves me sore for 2 days, this one I barely even felt anything when I was doing it. I would stick with Ripped in 30 or 30 Day Shred!"
2,fast fix,"The work out is ok, I only did it once. I was looking for something new because I was getting board with the dvds I already had. What I didn't like was you have to be online to play the video. I don't have a lot of time to wait for the internet to kick on just to workout :("
1,Pirated DVD!,I would have given this a zero if I were able to. If you look closely at the cover it is not as sharp and clear as the legitimate copies. Which by the way can be purchased at Walmart for approximately the same price.
4,Großartiges Ganzkörpertraining!,"Da Jillians DVD's ""NMTZ"" und ""Shred"" zu meinen favorisierten Fitness-DVD's zählen, wollte ich -auf der Suche nach einemfordernden Cardio-Training- auch die ""Kickbox Fast Fix"" ausprobieren:Sie hat mich nicht enttäuscht!Im Tutorial-Video werden die Punches und Kicks vorab durch Jillian langsam gezeigt und ausführlich erklärt.Ich empfehle jedem, sich diese Bewegungsabläufe zuerst zu verinnerlichen, denn die folgenden 3 Workouts á 20 Min.sind wirklich temporeich und nicht einfach!Workout 1 konzentriert sich hierbei auf den Oberkörpers, Workout 2 auf den Unterkörper und Workout 3 auf die Bauchmuskeln.Bislang habe ich nur ""Workout 1"" geübt, mich dabei auf die richtige Ausführung und Körperhaltung konzentriert.Das Training ist fordernd... und ich freue mich auf die weiteren Einheiten!Fazit:Hat gute Chancen sich bei meinen Lieblings-DVDs einzureihen, die ""Shred"" und ""NMTZ"" gefallen mir persönlich bislang jedoch besser!"
1,Beware Amazon is selling this as a DVD-R.....,DVD-R's are notorious for not lasting very long. They start pixalating over time and soon become unplayable. I have had video's in the past on DVD-r's and they do not last as long as DVD's.
2,Love Kickboxing...NOT with Jillian!,"I tried out this workout & was extremely disappointed! The workout seemed rushed, complicated & worked just one side of the body!!! I would not recommend this workout.P.S- I am an intermediate exerciser & own most of the Jillian, Jackie Warner, Firm tapes. I compared my review to the other DVDs that I exercise to."
3,too scary,"I love Jillian Michaels, but as I get older I can't do her stuff, after doing at 42 I ended up needing a year of physio therapy adn pilates....so this is a bit to scary for me...i think you need to be careful with this one."
5,Love this DVD!,"I love this DVD! I included it in my weekly workout schedule to mix things up. You can either do individual 20 minute workouts, or the full hour. The last one (abs) is my favorite!"
5,Great Workout Video!,"This video keeps your heart rate going for sure! I like working out to videos because they help me follow through with my entire workout and push me along. Without them, I always seem to quit early and cut my workouts short!! Jillian's series of videos definitely give me the extra push I need @!@$"
2,Poor Sound Quality,The sound quality is very poor on this item. The sound goes in and out and its frustrating because I will often need to adjust the volume as I'm using it.
4,Excellent workout,I have a few of Jillian Michaels workout DVDs and this is one of my favorite! I love the kickboxing...20 mins...it doesn't wear you out like a long cardio workout and it's a perfect little work out that I look forward to doing.
1,Received it in spanish,Not sure what happened...I bought this for my kindle and it's in spanish.I do not see in the description that the video was in spanish. Not sure what happened
4,Another Good Workout,"Found this on sale early at local book store so grabbed. Someone must have messed up and stocked early.Similar to her other 20 minute workouts - there are 3 levels and kickboxing it is. I had a good sweat after doing level 1 and really good one when I did 1 & 2 together. I like that there are more girls and they do the workout with great intensity.So while I did like it and will put in my rotation, being an avid Tae-boer did not find it extremely challenging. There are many similarities but I find I was increasing tempo on my own for some of the exercises as I'm used to being able to do more advanced versions from my Tae-bo days. It is a nice change but would not put as one of my favorite JM's one - Banish Fat, Boost Metabolism is still top of the list for me."
1,Disappointment,"I like Jillian Michaels for the most part but I did not like this workout and I've been doing cardio kickboxing for years. The moves are way too quick so they don't flow well and Jillian doesn't work the other side of the body for the second circuit. If you want a good kickboxing DVD Cathe Friedrich is the best!!! I own three of her DVDs and love them. Cathe's DVD are a little more expensive but don't forget, sometimes you get what you pay for."
2,Not Her Best,"I recently bought this and her 30-day shred. I am in good physical shape, and I go to the gym 3-4 times a week. I was looking for a quick 20 minute kickboxing routine that could suffice on the days I just couldn't drive to the gym for 20 minutes...I figured if anyone would be intense in 20 minutes, it would be Jillian. The workouts do get you sweating, but I am seriously annoyed at the fact that she does basically every sequence on one side only. Really? Was this when you knew nothing? How can you do all the sequences on only one side of the body? My right arm is going to be ripped. My left, that's another story. Also, she cools you down so quick it's from 60 to 0 in .2 seconds. That's bad for you. Overall, to make this a good routine I'll have to switch sides halfway through sequences myself and cool down slower and longer. I wouldn't buy it again."
1,Unbalanced?,"It was weird...in each workout, she does not balance it well...for example, kick with right leg is not balanced with the same moves to kick with the left leg. Every single circuit was like that. Kinda wierd."
1,Not that good,"I love Jillian's videos but this one is really short you have to do it after you did something else before, I believed it was going to be like the others so, no I will not recomend this one at all."
3,"Good workout, but the combinations are hard.","This DVD offers challenging kickboxing workouts. I've done my share of workout DVDs, so I thought this would be a nice addition to my collection. It was a little too much for me. Jillian offers a tutorial, which helped, but while the individual moves are broken down, the combinations are not. I didn't get a chance to practice them slowly before trying them in the workout. This made for a less effective workout as some of the moves are complicated when you put them together at the high rate of speed presented by the DVD. I gave each of the three workouts a second chance, but I think I need a more remedial kick boxing workout first. If you are experienced at kick boxing, you would probably enjoy the DVD as the workouts presented are very good."
5,Great workout,Another great Jillian workout! I like how the three different workouts focus on three different areas of the body while doing cardio. I use it combined with the No More Trouble Zones and it is a good combo.
4,Love it,I love kick boxing and I love this workout. JM goes through the workout quickly with seamless transitions. It makes the time fly by. You can do a 20 min segment or all 3 for a full 60 min workout.
5,What i expected!,"I got this yesterday and it was awesome. I have never done any of Jillian Michael's workouts, and this really kicks butt! I did level one and i was pouring in sweat. Will definately recommend. Going to do level 2 and three tonight!"
3,Love Jillian but this is not enough,"I purchased this since I moved to a new state and am craving serious cardio.Martial Arts is definitely one of my favorite ways to get cardio and I love Jillian, so I thought this would be a perfect mix.Unfortunately, while these work outs are super fun, I don't see this as being heavy cardio.I even added hand weights to up the difficulty and found it pretty easy.The work outs are definitely fun though so I'll keep doing them, adding more weight and ankle weights.I am experienced in martial arts and have pretty good cardio (the first time I did these work outs, I did two back to back and barely felt winded) so I think this might be good for an intermediate level person.The moves are quick and can be dangerous if not executed properly.I suggest watching the workouts a few times through and practicing the moves because I admit that I was lost a few times.Will anything ever come close to an in person core fusion cardio class? Probably not!"
5,one of the best,"One of the best CD I have so far with Jillian Michaels. I bought something else and I got disappointed. I have almost all her CD out there and I like this one the best. If I have to give 100 stars I would for the music, quality and work. I can work out for 20 minutes with my kids in the house. It is hard for me to work out more than 20 minutes because of my young kids. I would recommend this CD to anybody who wants to loose weight and get in shape by burning calories."
2,not the best,"I've been doing Tae-Bo for a while and wanted something different. I got a little tired of Billy. I like Jillian, so I thought I'd try her kickboxing work out. I was very disappointed. It didn't seem like anyone was together. The moves were confusing at first and it only worked one side of your body."
3,Great Workout But Difficult to Learn,"I ordered the Kickbox FastFix dvd after using Jillian's 30 Day Shred and Yoga Meltdown workouts for several months. The kickbox workouts deliver in terms of challenging your body, but learning the complicated combination moves is distracting. For someone without prior exposure to kickboxing, such as myself, trying to keep up with the routines is frustrating."
3,my thoughts,It's a killer workout for the short length so effective. The last one I'll skip or have to modify because it bothered my back.
3,Not my favorite,"I like a video that doesn't have people cheering and ""wooing"" while working out like they are having a blast - and unfortunately this video is filled with annoying girls who do just that. the upper body work out is ok - but I definitely don't work up the same sweat I do in 30-day shred. It's a good change up from the regular 30 day shred, but not as good of a work outTry it- if you can get past the WOOOOO and YAY!! that the back ups do."
2,Not at all what I expected,"I am not a big fan of this workout video. I love kickboxing on the Wii and was hoping this was going to be something a little more like that. I like that Julian works you out and you feel like you just worked out, but I am new to kickboxing and would like her to demonstrate a little better. However, in a lot of her videos I find she doesn't show/demonstrate very well and once I feel lost or unable to do something I get upset and lose interest. I think she doesn't grasp that everyone on the other side of the TV are not one of her girls and jsut learning for the first time. Very disappointed and feel I wasted money."
2,"Good workout, hate the commentary","The workout is great. I break a sweat and feel exhausted afterwards. However, I hate doing this workout because I hate Jillian's commentary. I feel like she is sexually harassing one of the other women working out. I am not biased against anyone's sexual preference, but Jillian needs to save the flirting for another time.I'm anxiously awaiting the point where I know this workout well enough that I can turn off the sound and turn on my own music."
3,Not my favorite,"I LOVE Jillian and I have all of her other videos but this one just doesn't do it for me. The moves are good but it felt lopsided and made me feel very uncoordinated. The punches and kicks just didn't flow and felt very awkward. I ended up just doing my own combination since it all burns calories. I do love the 20 minute segments when you are short on time or when you are using this in addition to something else but on it's own, it isn't my go to workout."
2,Incomplete dvd,"I downloaded this dvd on Sunday, tried it out yesterday. Like other reviwers have said, the music at times is too loud and its difficult to hear Jillian's instructions. The workout is excellent. My issue was that the dvd on instant play is incomplete. Jillian's website and she herself mentions a tutorial where you can learn the steps but the instant play version does not have the tutorial. So i would not recommend downloading this from amazon.Now to get the complete dvd I'm going to have to buy the dvd and pay an extra $5 and wait for it to be mailed. I'm rather disappointed with Amazon's lack of scrutiny."
5,IT GOT MY HEART RATE UP,I just received this dvd yesterday I only did work out 1. Remind you I've never did kickboxing or many workout dvds to begin with. I'm not in great shape but I do cardio on my recumbent bike but this is different & I hit a plateau so I'm trying to switch things up a bit & see what happens! first I have to say I do like Jillian a lot she seems to explain her moves & this dvd had me sweating pretty bad in 20 mins. I say buy it if you like Jillian & like kickboxing! 3 - 20 min work outs. Eventually I'll aim to do more then 1 at a time. But I def think this is a good work out.
1,This was meant for the Gen-4 audio only iPod,"This does fit a 60GB video iPod but not very well. It was clearly designed for the Gen-4 iPod and now being remarketed for the video iPod. I received one and sent it back for a refund. I believe I have found a much better ""ruggedized"" rubber case from Speck Products. It costs more but appears to be worth it:http://www.speckproducts.com/vid-toughskin.html"
2,Fits 30 gig video well.,"The case does fit the 30 gig video well, but that all it does well. The armband is to thin and cuts into your arm. It also does stay in the clip well at all. I have had it drop to the floor twice in the middle of workouts. The clip is also very cheap. You get what you pay for, go for something of better quality and a little more money. I am now shoping for a new workout case."
1,Not worth the money,This is a cheap and flimsy armband. NOT THE ONE IN THE PICTURE. There are much better on Amazon for less money.
2,Not for the 5th generation!,"This case is actually made for fourth generation models and although it is being advertised as being for the fifth, the case is too big for a snug fit. It works, but I didn't spend this money for something that was advertised as being made for the new Ipod. Real scam!"
2,Not for running or jogging--just a case,"I wouldn't call this a ""sport case"" for even a second. It's basically an ipod case with a belt clip that includes an accessory that's an elastic armband--I'm a girl with pretty skinny arms and the armband fits pretty good. But unfortunately if you try to jog or bike or anything with this, your ipod will be flopping all over. I use it at the gym if I'm using the weightlifting machines, but that's it. The quality of the clip doesn't even seem to strong, but for $7.49 it makes a pretty good protective case."
3,Uncomforable but does the job,"This armband unit is a little flimsy and doesn't feel comfortable around the arms. Although there is nothing to secure the ipod from the top, it fits pretty snug so it won't fall out."
5,Great way to keep your IPOD while moving around.,This case keeps your IPOD secure and protected from dropping while running or just working around the house. It doesn't get in the way and it stays safe.
3,Fits my needs but not my arm,"I was really excited to get this product because I wanted to wear on my arm while I play the keyboard. I read the reviews and some people did say if you have small arms it wouldnt work...however, with a little twisting I was able to get it on my arm but it's not very comfortable...So the bottom line is that I do use the product but I wish they made a smaller arm band."
1,Not the same as the ipod monster cable...,"i bought this because i also have an ipod monster cable for my old ipod, and that works really well. i bought a zune hd and figured that id buy this before replacing the stereo in my car. much to my dismay this monster cable is awful. i dont really understand how the ipod version can work so much better than this version, but whatever. it was only like 10 bucks when i bought it so its not a big deal, just frustrating. if you really want to enjoy your zune while you drive buy a new stereo/head unit for your car that has either an aux in port or a usb port, or both. but if money really is an issue for you then id reccomend you dont spend any money on this product."
1,Terrible Monster Product!,"I was VERY disappointed in this product. I purchased this product because of the ""MONSTER"" name. That was evidently a bad choice. The sound quality was worse than a record player. That is when I could actually get a station where I could hear what was playing on the Zune. I wouldn't pay $10 for this product much less the $75 after shipping. DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT, you'll just end up sending it back and lose $5 or more in shipping costs!!!"
2,Go with an AUX cable,"I've had my dealings with FM transmitters before, from DLO to Monster FM transmitters, you name it I've had it. All I have to say is that they're really a waste of money. The only good thing about them is that they charge your ipod or zune, otherwise then that their sound quality sucks, never a good reception. My suggestion is this, buy an AUX cable for $3 on Amazon and save your money."
5,Great Guide Book for anyone,"Excellent Photos and descriptions for the collector or buyer. Well written, I would recommend it highly, the writer is also very helpful with information."
5,Footage to be remembered.,"Eyewitness Shark is one of a number of excellent videos made by this studio. The footage is absolutely breathtaking, even tranquil in some clips. As you would expect, the video is about the life history of the shark, and some myths along with it. It also explains that humans have always misunderstood these animals as cold- blooded killers.There is also some footage that may make this video unique. There is an actual scene of a Blue Shark drowning an innocent surfer. Whoa there Eyewitness! This film is not geared toward young children. It is made for people who seek a better understanding of the sea and its marvels.The film may be slightly, but insignificantly confusing at times. The direct switching of one scene to another without a long breath may confuse some who have a wavering attention span. (Just a precaution for other viewers.)However, if you are a scuba diver and love the sea, devour Eyewitness Shark and the unforgettable footage."
5,Carrot is the man!!!!!!!!!!,"Anime fans should really check out Sorcerer Hunters. It is thebest new series (released in the U.S. anyway) that I haveseen. somewhere inbetween Ranma 1/2 and Slayers! It is a must for any Slayers fan. Having talked with Bret Weaver (Carrot) at Akon 10, I found this series even more of a riot! Having the voices of Bret, and Tiffany Grant (Auska to all you EVA fans!) I strongly recomend the English dubbed version!"
3,Mixed bag for Bond fans,"I found this to be one of the more difficult Bond continuation novels to read. That's not to say that it's poorly written--it contains some very good characterizations and some intricate plotting. However, it departs fairly drastically from the 'Bond formula' (if there is such a thing)--dealing with issues of war crimes, genocide and terrorism. Additionally, I found the structure of the novel to be very slow--there's little of the globe-trotting Bond that we've learned to follow around from Fleming and from the films."
4,Beautiful Ladies!,Very nice collabo both dancers in their own league and nice vocals make a nice combination. Nothing earth shattering but very mellow and entertaining.
5,A great practical guide for therapy dogs,"Kris has provided us with great new insight and tips into our work with therapy dogs. The examples are wonderful - and in my mind one of the best parts is on her discussion of social proximity and how important it is to understand this in ALL of our visits. A job well done!!! A must readKate Nicoll, MSW, author Soul Friends: Finding healing with animals, founder Soul Friends, Inc."
5,Essential information,Valuable information for everyone who does pet therapy with their dog. I wish I would have read this before I began pet therapy. An excellent easy to understand book.
2,Works to a point,I bought Calamine Lotion for my ance (in 2008 the FDA approved it for treating ance) and it worked at first but then it slowly stop working. Then the bottle doesn't display much direction for anything so it was confusing from beginning to end. AND DO NOT LEAVE THIS PRODUCT ON YOUR FACE FOR OR ANYWHERE FOR MORE THAN AN 45 MINUTES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! For the reason that my friend and I received dark spots in those areas when the product is left on for more than 30 mins.
5,love rifftrax,this was by far one of the strangest movies ive ever seen but the commentary for it is fitting as well as hilarious. a must for anyone who is a fan of mst3k or rifftrax
5,Crazy and hilarious!,"We ordered this one based on some of the reviews we read, and it is absolutely worth every penny! I have decided to make it a newChristmas tradition in our family, ala Santa with muscles or a Christmas story. The parts that involve Santa are very funny, but theThumbelina splice in story was not nearly as funny....I wish it was all Santa, all Easter bunny. If your young kids are bustingout with laughter in the first few minutes, you know its gonna be good!!!"
3,Didn't hold my interest,I found the characters to be either boring or totally annoying and disgusting. I just couldn't care about anyone in this story.
2,Disappointing read,"Having seen the positive reviews on Amazon, and also after being very impressed with the writings of Mankell, Indridason, Nesbo, was looking forward to this book but was rather disappointed. The storyline was not bad but the flow of the writing felt disjointed and choppy. It may be a result of translation but at times, it seemed like I had accidentally picked up a book from the young adults section. This, combined with occasions where detail was put in which felt more like loose threads that were not woven into the whole story made this a less than satisfactory book for me."
2,Oof...how clunky can you get?,"I'll blame the translator. Huge fan of northern European detective fiction - Mankel, Nesbo, Larson, et al. - so ordered Tursten's book. Not even close to the others, partly because of what I assume is a terrible translation - sorry but the words ""slammer"" and ""consolingly"" don't fit in the same sentence. The translation veers between slang and Henry James - and not for any particular reason - Steven Murray just does not have the ""flow"" that other translators have. Too bad as for Huss, she is an OK character, although her reflections on her life are rather cliched. Her observations and ruminations lack something that other writers from northern Europe seem to have found. I've moved on to Iceland and Indridason who is right there with the best. As for Tursten and Huss, go to the library and read a few pages/chapters before investing."
4,General Review,This is an indepth review of the nurses in general. I was looking more for a one person story. This a lot of information about what ladies battled in their quest to be useful in the war.
2,Not a real poster.,"I was under the impression that this was a real poster that I was buying. Now it was the actual size described, but you could tell it had been printed up. It wasn't an actual movie poster. Ink job was crappy."
5,Great for Big Dogs,Love this crate! Durable but lightweight and the neutral color blends in with the rest of the room. Our labrador uses this as his sleeping crate - he hops right in every night.
3,Meets the airline's specification for shipping pets,"Good things:The solid base with a drain gully - its not going to leak anything out in your car.We have just used it to ship our cat across the atlantic - it fully meets the airline's requirements (which are strict and detailed). In particular it is held together with screws (not clips like less professional kennel's) and it has the little holes around the door that are needed for security ties to hold the door shut.My very strong 22Lbs cat couldn't get out of it or do it any damage (and he tried, believe me).Only one bad thing: the plastic around the handle is pretty thin gauge, and on ours it cracked, allowing the handle to come away from the kennel, which meant that our pet got dropped. This did not improve his mood."
3,Big but fine,It is very easy to put together. It is much bigger than expected so make sure you need the size for your dog. I have to turn it side ways in my pickup to close the tailgate. If your dog is over 100lbs it will have plenty of room.
1,Warning - shipped without a door!,"Just a word of caution - I received my vari kennel at what I thought was a good price - didn't fully open it right away. When I did, I discovered that it had been shipped to me without a door. A serious drawback for a dog crate! Unfortunately, it was beyond the return period and now I'm stuck with a crate without a door. I'll have to order my own door."
4,Great for airline travel,I was worried because of the previous reviews but ordered the kennel with time to spare before I shipped my 65 lbs boxer 1500 miles. Due to her size and breed I ordered the XL size. It does have ventilation on all four sides and seems to be doing OK. It made the trip with no problem. The only thing that would be better is if it came with food and water bowls.
5,kennel,"Petmate Ultra Vari Kennel-its a great kennel & great price- prompt delivery. Seems sturdy. I have a Pitbull. She likes it better than the wire cage. I didn't feel safe with her in that. This one, I do."
1,Sizes Aren't Right,I have a 60 lb. dog and the kennel description says it fits up to a 70lb. dog. I think the kennel is good for up to a 50 lb. dog and that would be pushing it. I want to return this item but it would be a fortune to return.
3,Wish I had read all the reviews,"I ordered the giant dog crate. I read the reviews on what a great dog crate this is, the desciption says it meets USDA and IATA requirements and the picture shows that it is ventilated on all 4 sides as required for international flights. Not so. The crate is great but not acceptable. I wish Amazon would change the picture or state that the giant crate will not be accepted for international travel because it has no vents in the back. No time to exchange so out comes the drill."
2,Not what they used to be.,"Have used these crates for 40+ years of showing dogs and they sure are not what they used to be. Crate was delivered in large cardboard box and when opened corner was badly chipped. Plastic is much more hard and riged then my older cages. I am sure it will not stand up to much usage. Note to self, better go back to metal dog cages in the future."
5,Vari Kennel 700,"Seached for awhile for this size of Vari Kennel - Amazon shocked me by having it - best price and free shipping!Our kennel did a bit of a side trip when the train it was being shipped on was derailed in Wolf Point MT, was not sure we would ever see it, but it arrived about a week late and in amazing excellent condition.Vari Kennels are the best by far - we have had a 400 for years, but our Malamute pup out grew it, so needed to go big. He loves it, so do we!!"
5,It's Just Perfect!!!,"It is well done, I have a 1 year old Golden Retriever and he hit it many time but the crate resisted. It's perfect.Now My Golden Retriever Is Two Years Old and the crate is like new. I'm From Venezuela and it has traveled many times and has resisted all of them. Besides, the space that my dog has is incredible. The crate is 36 x 25 x 27-Inch, just perfect. 100% Recommended!!!"
4,Big size,I got this for my 11 year old son. Unfortunately it is a bit too long. Otherwise it is a nice product with wonderful smelling leather.
5,thumb guards,The product came on time. It is at my house and will be opened by my brother for xmas. Horah
2,Greasy,"I would agree with everyone else. These are notably very greasy but still taste good. I got into the habit of wrapping them in paper towels, which is a little foul now that I think about it. I for some reason thought these were the healthiest jerky one could buy with Amazon Subscribe and Save, but turns out the standard beef version from the same brand is basically the same, without the grease:http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GW0U3E/ref=rcx_subs_dp"
1,YUCK ! ! !,This product has a really bad taste. They had a lot of fat and gristle. I will never buy again. I will stick to Jack Links Flamin' Buffalo Chicken Nuggets.
1,Get your RDA of salt and gristle in one bite!,"I've been eating Jack Link's turkey jerky products for years. They're a staple stocking stuffer in our house. This was my first online bulk order. I'm not sure what happened to the product as I've never had this problem before. But whoa... something changed. I love salty food, but this is quite a bit saltier than when I've bought it in the store. I could prob live with that. Until I found myself chewing on gristle every third bite. Ugh. Nuff said."
2,Too salty for me,"I have enjoyed several types of Jack Link's 2oz steak products, including teriyaki and oven roasted turkey, but this particular variety seems much saltier than the others. I suppose if you really like salty food, this is for you, but I prefer the other flavors better."
3,"tasty and good protein source, but too much sodium","Good protein source and very tasty, but way too much sodium. I should have checked to nutritional info more closely before purchasing"
1,Buy any other flavor - trust me.,"Greasy! Crap flavor.I have tried all the other flavors and don't know how this one can even exist! Tastes like someone hit a turkey on the side of the rode and brought is home, boiled it, and pressed it under their pickup truck tire."
1,Fatty and way too salty,Yuck! I wrote amazon about the quality of this product and they shipped me another box..ha... These things were terrible...really fatty.
5,perfect,"This is my second album and it is as good as his first. Beautiful, unique guitar. Great energy!Very upbeat"
5,From the Publisher,"""From the archives of the National Baseball Library in Cooperstown, New York, here are thirty fascinating photographs of the players of the so-called Negro leagues. From 1897 until 1945, when Jackie Robinson signed a contract with the Brooklyn Dodgers, Black players were not allowed in the major leagues. So the Negro leagues were formed, with their own regional leagues that met in their own world series. This book of postcards is a lasting tribute to these legendary stars of baseball. 30 duotone photographs.""Pomegranate's books of postcards contain thirty top-quality reproductions bound together in a handy, artful collection.

3,"A Few Good Songs, But Mediocre At Best","Probably the two most notable tracks on ""Lap of Luxury""--or at least the two I hear most often on '80s-oriented radio stations--are #3: ""The Flame"" (a tireless ballad and popular hit, even after 15 years) and #6: ""Don't Be Cruel"" (a great Elvis Presley cover--very upbeat). These two songs are also my only favorites on here; the others are mostly misses for me--nothing exceptional. But if you're into '80s pop/melodic rock, then you might like this CD."
3,Chgeap Trick LOL,"Although this was the beginning of a bad spell of records for the Tricksters, you will get enjoyment from half the album."
2,Over produced crap,"In an effort to revive their careers, outside songwriters are brought in and slick late 80s production (keyboards, highly processed guitar soungs) dominate. I guess it paid off because ""The Flame"" was a huge hit. It's not terrible as ballads go, but it's a pretty lowest common denominator kind of song. ""Never Had a Lot to Lose"" is top notch Cheap Trick pop rock and the Elvis cover ""Don't Be Cruel"" is fun. The opener, ""Let Go"", is alright but beyond that it's thin pickings.If you're looking for good Cheap Trick try any of their first 5 albums (Cheap Trick, In Color, Heaven Tonight, At Budokan, Dream Police), the 1997 self titled CD on Red Ant Records (very hard to find these days) or the recent two CD Budokan Set. That'll put the power in your power pop."
3,Radio Hits and more commercial success,"New sound that is pop radio friendly which is ok, though offending the fans from the beginning. The band still delivers and evolved to meet the times."
3,It is what it is.,"Personally I don't think this is nearly as bad as some apparently think it is. However, there are a few lame tracks, and the album as a whole is very 1988. This is very worth it for the hits though, like the cover of ""Don't Be Cruel"", ""Ghost Town"", and the mega-ballad ""The Flame"". I also really like ""Never Had Alot To Lose"", and the dramatic ""All We Need Is A Dream"". The rest isn't terrible, just fair. I admit they have better albums out, but more than half of ""Lap Of Luxury"" still gets me ""All Wound Up""."
3,"""Comeback Album""","Lap of Luxury would probably have to considered Cheap Trick's comeback album, in that it produced a #1 hit in ""The Flame"", after a period that had found them at their lowest level commercially. This album is slickly produced, and lacks the raw, rocking sound of a lot of their other albums. The songwriting and lyrics are subpar, but the playing is great. ""Let Go"" starts the album off well, it's a strong, energetic song with a good chorus. ""Never Had A Lot To Lose"", Space, and their remake of ""Don't Be Cruel"" are all solid efforts. However, most of the other songs are lacking for one reason or another, and I find ""Ghost Town"" to be a dismal, boring ballad, though the members of Cheap Trick are said to enjoy the song. ""The Flame"" is a rare item, a ballad that has staying power, and even sounds better live when Rick puts more edge into the guitar work. Not a rocker, but an album that should please a very wide range of buyers."
4,Lap of Luxury (1988),"After a decade of falling further down the charts, Cheap Trick came bouncing back towards the top with 1988's Lap of Luxury. By 1988 Cheap Trick hadn't had a hit record or single in years, but Lap of Luxury changed that. Lap of Luxury briefly brought Cheap Trick back into the spotlight. While Lap of Luxury is not Cheap Trick's best album it does have quite a bit to offer however. Lap of Luxury spawned the hit powerballad ""The Flame"", and a cover of Elvis Presley's ""Don't Be Cruel."" Other highlights include: ""Ghost Town"", Let Go, and Never Had a Lot to Lose."
2,Dylan's Second Poorest Album Of The 80s,"This awful album is outdone in crapiness only by the even more awful ""Knocked Out Loaded"". As a huge Dylan fan, I really wondered if the master had lost it, when I heard this mistake on vinyl."
2,Dylan's biggest slump,"I give this CD two stars simply because of the name Bob Dylan. However, ""Down in the Groove"" is, quite simply, Dylan's worst release.He was in the midst of quite a slump when this CD was recorded. Consider the other efforts at the time: ""Knocked Out Loaded"" and that dreadful tour with the Grateful Dead...captured in all it's weariness with the CD ""Dylan and the Dead.""And yet ""Down in the Groove"" is the worst of it all. Even ""Silvio,"" considered the highlight of the album by many, would have been left off most other Dylan CDs. He recorded this album as if he simply didn't care, and Dylan fans at the time must have thought ""the finishing end"" was at hand.But Dylan is Dylan. The slump would soon be over. Big time. The Traveling Wilburys and ""Oh, Mercy"" were just around the corner."
3,what is bad for some is fine for others,"For some reason I love Shenandoah on this album. It is a wonderful song, and it sounds different and new on this album. This is a listenable album, not the best or most brilliant, but has the familiar sound of a brilliant artist. It is interesting who the backing artists are on this album, as well as Knocked Out Loaded."
5,WHAT A BOB!,"There's a lot here that would merit serious consideration for Bob Dylan's Top 100. The rock songswere probably fun to play on, the ballads have a lot of nice touches, Silvio demonstrates that his voice hasn't quite degenerated into the rheumy monotone that made the last tour so great and can still perform when called upon, Death Is Not The End and Ninety Miles An Hour have the gravity and warmth of much of his best gospel work and When Did You Leave Heaven? is distinguished by the most excellent guitar coda this side of a Faces bootleg."
1,A depressing display of Dylanesque decay!,There are far better and more worthy representations of Dylan's talent than this unworthy collection of boring songs.
1,Oh mercy. . .please have mercy on us Bob,"Why doesn't Dylan just stick to writing his own material. When he does other people's stuff it inevitably is awful, usually. . ."
1,It's crap!!!!!,"There's an old sayin' up here in the highlands. ""If it's no made in Scotland, It's CRAP!!!!"". This one was obviously no made in Scotland"
1,No way dude! Bob didn't waste his time!,"Yes Bob did. He would've been better off waiting a couple of years for the inspiration that created an album like ""Oh Mercy"" than the boredom that created this mess."
1,"Still down in a funk, Dylan messes it up again.","As on his previous album ""Knocked Out Loaded"", Dylan remains uninspired It's a shame that Dylan put out so much poor music in the late 80s that led to such albums as this one. Listening to this album its impossible to believe that this is the same man they once called ""The Voice Of A Generation"
1,Dylan flubs it.,"Dylan's exellence is the best of man, but not here. Dylan the genius, the master of rock poetry takes a foray into the inane on this disaster."
1,Bob ain't the man!,"BOB AIN'T THE MAN! AT LEAST NOT ON THIS ALBUM He proves that he ain't the man by singing such dumb songs, and he writes them too! who would have dreamed an artist so great good do an album so bad?"
1,A great artist does a bad album,"Dylan may be the voice of his generation and a genius to boot, but none of that genius is evident here at all."
1,Bob Ain't The Man,"BOB AINT THE MAN! AT LEAST NOT ON THIS ALBUM He proves that he ain't the man by singing such inane songs, and he writes them too! who else could do something so awful?"
4,"It's The Groooove, Man!","As a life-long Dylan addict I have come to expect great things from The Bob. I was not disappointed with Down In The Groove. This is one of my all time favorite Dylan collections. It is just what the title says; A very nice groove. That groove is carried by a well-balanced collection of interesting (and very solid) songs. Bob is not trying to impress or record hits here. He's simply catching some quality time with his guitar, playing songs he enjoys. Relax. Stop trying to figure out if this CD is good or bad, worthy or unworthy. If you get into that rut...you'll miss the groove. Just enjoy!"
3,Awesome gems,This is the epitome of a CD with gems hidden amongst awful filler. Here are the gems:Death Is Not The End90 Miles An HourShenadoahRank StrangersThese gems are so good they deserve the stars. Make a mix with just the above.
1,Good album for civil war dunces,"""Shenandoah"" is on this regord. James stewart and Doug mcCLure was in ""Shenandoah."" Bob Dillon must be Doug mcclURe or James Stewart then, trite? I sur spel gud dont i"
1,Down in the mud is more like it.,"Contemplating an introduction to Dylan and his music, skip this one. It's not worth the time."
1,Dylan's eccentricity gets the best of him.,"Dylan the genius, the master of rock poetry takes a foray into the inane on this disaster."
1,"I Love Bob!!, Just, not on this one.","This disc proves that you can definitely go wrong with Dylan. He's almost always great, but he certainly doesn't deliver here. I think Dylan usually makes great music because he cares so much about most of the stuff that he releases, but I don't know what he was thinking on this one. No one puts as much effort into his music as Dylan, no one, but Dylan must have been drunk or depressed when he layed this one down. ""Death is the End"" if you listen to this."
1,Right up there with,"Knocked Out Loaded, Empire Burlesque, Real Live, Saved and Live At Budokan, one-star albums all. The 80's were not kind to his Bob-ness."
1,"When did this crawl out of hell, and when will it crawl back in?","As much as I bashed Knocked Out Loaded, at least it had Brownsville Girl. There's NOTHING I like about Down in the Groove. literally. I usually leave the room when the best song (Silvio) plays. To say nothing of the worst... more of thoes banal love songs (Let's Stick Together; Sally Sue Brown; When Did You Leave Heaven; Had a Dream About You, Baby) and more awful covers (most of the aforementioned plus Let's Stick Together; 90 Miles Per Hour; Shenandoah and Rank Strangers To Me) and awful attempts at humor (Ugliest Girl in the World) and philosophy (Death is Not the End). Bob's successes are spectacular, sure, but his failures are equally so. Case in point: this one."
1,DUD! From Dylan,"I GIVE IT A FLOP REVIEW! A cursory listen to this disc tells me that it is simply one of the 10 worst discs of all time. Of course the other 9 aren't necessarily Bob Dylan discs, but if you can afford 10 discs then you should avoid this one."
3,But there's some real gems on it,"OK, there's so much bad fluff I'd never listen to it straight through, but the following four tracks are wonderful: Death Is Not The End, 90 Miles An Hour, Shenandoah, and Rank Strangers. Death Is Not The End was covered well by Nick Drake on his CD with Kylie Minogue and others, with that great line ""when the city's on fire with the burning flesh of men, and you search in vain to find when law abiding citizen, just remember...death is not the end."""
5,Awesome!,"Still feeling funky, Dylan does it up again. As on his previous album ""Knocked Out Loaded"", Dylan remains inspired It's awesome that Dylan put out so much great music in the late 80s that led to such albums as this one. Listening to this album its possible they once called ""The Voice Of A Generation"
3,Ragged & Beautiful,"I love this album - the songs all sound like very casual demos & rough mixes. It sounds like Dylan has rummaged through a bunch of rehearsal material & put together a mix-tape! Relaxed & confident, this is a really fun collection. Highlights: When Did You Leave Heaven & Shenandoah. But there's lots to like here. I recommend coupling this with 'Knocked Out Loaded', they're really Side A & Side B of the same ""album""."
1,"For ""Gunsmoke"" fans everywhere","Once again adapting his persona of Marshal Bob Dylan from the long-running western TV show ""Gunsmoke,"" James Arness offers sincere, if not always competent versions of beloved cowboy songs. Not known as a singer in the first place, it must have taken nerve for Arness to also co-write a few of the selections here (credited to his fictional alter ego, Marshal Bob Dylan). These songs fail to compare with the other ones proving that Arness' talents lie in the area of interpretation, not composition. Good as this collection is, one still wonders what Dan Blocker could have done with these tunes."
5,A Slice of the Good stuff!,"""When did Bob Leave Heaven"" and come down here and write all these great songs? Did ""Sally Sue Brown"" help out? This one is a keeper!"
5,I LOVE THIS DISC!,"One of Dylan's supremely underrated cds. I listen to it all the time. ""Sally Sue Brown"" and ""Let's Stick Together"" are great rock tunes. His version of the Stanley Brothers classic ""Rank Stranger"" is awesome. Just great."
1,"No, I'm From Groove","Listening to this disc brings back a lot of memories. But this album stinks, man does it stink to high heaven. It's simply awful, boring, stupid and senseless."
5,Dylan's exellence is the best of man.,"Dylan the genius, the master of rock poetry takes a foray into the beautiful on this masterpiece."
5,BOB IS THE MAN!,"BOB IS THE MAN! AT LEAST ON THIS ALBUM He proves that he is the man by singing such intellegent songs, and he writes them too! who else could do something so great?"
5,An uplifting display of Dylanesque music!,There are far better and worthy representations of Dylan's talent and this great collection of interesting songs.
